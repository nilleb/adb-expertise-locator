Financial \nprotection from disasters, i.e., disaster risk financing, has increasingly been applied in developed \ncountries. However, the application of ex ante disaster risk financing is very scarce in developing \ncountries including Bangladesh. Bangladesh is disaster-prone, with floods and cyclones being the most \nfrequent and severe danger. Based on historical data, natural hazard events in Bangladesh cost more \nthan  $10  billion  economic  losses  from  2000  to  2013,  but  the  total  funding  available  for  relief, \nrehabilitation,  and  reconstruction  for  the  same  period  was  $2  billion  only.  It  is  estimated  that \nBangladesh will incur a financial impact of about $3.2 billion on average per year due to cyclone and \nflood, or about 2.2% of gross domestic product. Bangladesh urgently needs to develop ex ante disaster \nrisk financing solutions to minimize economic impacts of catastrophes. Currently, three disaster risk \nfinance solutions are considered effective in Bangladesh: sovereign disaster risk contingent credit, \nparametric sovereign risk insurance, and disaster risk microfinance portfolio insurance. \n \n(cid:3) (cid:3)", "(cid:3)\nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \n \nTo  develop  a  strategy  for  effective  ex  ante  disaster  risk  financing  solutions  for  Bangladesh,  the  \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for \nDisaster Risk Finance (TA 8144-BAN) in August 2012 to the Government of Bangladesh.

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Disaster risk has broad social and developmental implications. However, in many countries, \nfinancial  protection  in  disaster  risk  management  is  still  limited,  causing  delayed  recovery  and \nreconstruction and worsening their socioeconomic impacts. Disaster risk financing requires developing \ndifferent options according to the nature of the disaster; the probability of occurrence; and the \npotential loss of, or impact on, life and physical capital. Take-up rates for disaster risk financing options \nare minimum in many developing countries. Adequate market-based disaster risk mitigation products \ndo not exist for certain perils in many countries, including Bangladesh. \n \n2.  Uncovered or unfunded catastrophe losses do not simply dissipate after a catastrophe, but \ninstead are paid by domestic taxpayers or international donors in the form of ex post (after the fact) \nrelief,  recovery,  and  reconstruction  expenses.  Closing  the  gap  between  funded  and  unfunded \ncatastrophe losses using the combination of appropriately designed disaster risk financing mechanisms \nis crucial for robust disaster risk management and, in many disaster-prone countries, sustainable \ndevelopment itself. This is especially true for Bangladesh, which has limited budgetary resources and \nlimited markets to support the proactive transfer of catastrophe risk. Sovereign entities should pay due \nconsideration to the aggregate economic exposure to catastrophes. Due to the recent socioeconomic \nchanges,  including  rapid  urbanization  and  climate  change,  a  holistic  approach  to  disaster  risk \nmanagement, including disaster risk financing, becomes even more important. \n \n3.  For Bangladesh, natural catastrophe risk is a considerable problem due to the population\u2019s low \nlevel of resilience and the high exposure to multiple hydrometeorological hazards, including tropical \ncyclones and extreme high rainfall leading to flooding. \n \n4.  Added to the high risk is the  lack  of disaster  insurance mechanisms among the general \npopulation. In Bangladesh, like in many developing countries, only a few of the country\u2019s assets are \ninsured, thus leaving a huge burden on the government to fund postdisaster response and recovery. \nAgain, in the case of Bangladesh, formal insurance mechanisms for catastrophes are very poorly \ndeveloped, and traditional informal mechanism of risk-sharing is unable to respond when major natural \ndisasters occur. \n \n5.  One of the challenges in natural catastrophe risk management is climate change. In many \nplaces around the world, particularly in low-lying coastal countries such as Bangladesh, increasing \nglobal air and ocean temperatures will inevitably lead to greater impacts of hydrometeorological \nevents. While tropical cyclone activity itself may not increase, increased sea level will lead to greater \nstorm  surge.  Climate  change  may  not  be  responsible  for  much  of  the  current  exposure  to \nhydrometeorological hazards in Bangladesh, but it will contribute to an increased risk and should serve \nas a call for action. Effective risk management strategies put in place early will provide a strong \nplatform for managing the increasing risk already being felt in other parts of Asia. \n \n \nII.      DISASTERS AND THEIR IMPACTS IN BANGLADESH \n \nA.  Overview \n \n6.  Bangladesh is one of the most at-risk countries in the world to natural hazards, mainly due to \nits high population density, low-lying topography, and geographical location (active monsoon and ", "2  ADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n \ntropical  cyclone  basin).  Bangladesh  is  regularly  exposed  to  different  hazards,  including  tropical \ncyclones, floods, earthquakes, severe storms, and others. The severity, frequency, and location of these \nhazards vary, as do the corresponding socioeconomic impact (Table 1).  \n \n \nTable 1: List of Major Hazards in Bangladesh \nPeril  Potential Severity Relative Frequency\nTropical cyclone  High High \nFlood  High High \nEarthquake  High Low \nSevere storm  Moderate High \nExtreme temperature  Low Moderate \nDrought  High Moderate \nFire  Local Moderate \nBuilding collapse  Local Low \nLandslide  Local Low \nArsenic contamination  \u2026 \u2026 \nRiverbank erosion  \u2026 \u2026 \nSaltwater intrusion  \u2026 \u2026 \nClimate change  \u2026 \u2026 \n\u2026 = not applicable. \nSource: ADB. 2015. Capacity Building for Disaster Risk Finance in Bangladesh. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 8144-BAN). \n \n \n7.  In general, floods and tropical cyclones most adversely impact Bangladesh, based on the \nnumber of people affected and the number of people killed. The majority of reported economic loss is \ndue to both floods and tropical cyclones. Severe storms, while very frequent, are typically local events \nand have a smaller effect on Bangladesh as a whole. Although the frequency of damaging earthquakes \nin Bangladesh has been relatively low, the potential for catastrophic damage and destruction is very \nhigh (Table 2). \n \n \nTable 2: General Hazard Consequence in Bangladesh (%) \nPeril  People Killed People Affected Estimated Damage\nFlood   7 75 68 \nTropical cyclone  89 18 27 \nSevere storm   1  1   5 \nEarthquake  <1 <1   \u2026a\nOthersb   2  6 \u2026 \n< = less than, \u2026 = not available. \na  It does not include $500 million damage reported for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. \nb  It includes building collapse, drought, extreme temperature, significant fire disasters, landslides, and significant transport or \nindustrial or miscellaneous accidents.

Tropical Cyclone \n \n8.  Bangladesh is within the active north Indian Ocean tropical cyclone basin, and more locally \nwithin the Bay of Bengal subbasin. The historical record indicates that an average of about five tropical \ncyclones with at least tropical storm strength (storms with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of \nat least 34 knots) occur in the Bay of Bengal subbasin every year, with about one per year passing \ndirectly through Bangladesh boarders. Tropical cyclone activity in Bangladesh is typically higher during \nMay, June, October, and November. The impact of tropical cyclones in Bangladesh can lead to many \nhazards, including but not limited to high winds, torrential rain, flooding, storm surge, and landslides. \nCyclones in Bangladesh are typically associated with severe storm surge.  \n \n9.  According to the International Disaster Database, 5 of the 10 deadliest tropical cyclones in the \nworld since 1900 occurred in Bangladesh.1 The 1970 Bhola cyclone is considered to be the deadliest \never recorded, with estimated over 500,000 people killed. The 1991 Bangladesh cyclone caused an \nestimated $1.8 billion\u2013$3.0 billion in  economic impact and over 138,000 deaths. More recently, \ntropical cyclone Sidr in 2007 caused significant economic impact, estimated at $1.7 billion\u2013$3.8 billion, \nalthough life loss was less than 5,000 people, illustrating the success of recent advancement in disaster \nrisk management in Bangladesh (e.g., disaster shelters, early warning systems, and timely evacuations). \n \n10.  Overall, available reports indicate that tropical cyclone events in Bangladesh since 1900 have \nresulted in 0.75 million\u20131.23 million lives lost, 61.6 million people affected, and $4.7 billion\u2013$9.0 billion \nin damages. Due to data gaps in some years, the actual historical impact is probably more severe. \nThe costliest tropical cyclones on record are tropical cyclone Sidr in 2007 ($3.8 billion maximum) \nand the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone ($3.0 billion maximum).

Flooding in Bangladesh is an annual phenomenon, with the most severe occurring during July \nand August. While most of the country is flood prone, four general types of flooding occur: (i) flash \nfloods caused by overflowing of hilly rivers in the eastern and northern regions, typically during April to \nMay  and  September  to  November;  (ii)  floods  caused  by  heavy  rains  and  drainage  congestion; \n(iii) monsoon floods caused by flooding of major rivers, typically during June to September; and \n(iv) coastal floods caused by storm surges. The situation is exacerbated as Bangladesh is a low-lying, \nriverine country (about 50% of the country is within 7 meters of mean sea level) and most of the \ncountry is on a delta plain at the confluence of the Ganges (Padma), Brahmaputra (Jamuna), and \nMeghna rivers.

Earthquake \n \n15.  Devastating  tropical  cyclones  and  floods  occur  frequently  in  Bangladesh,  but  no  major \nearthquake has affected Bangladesh in recent decades. This has created a feeling of false security \namong the public and some decision makers to think that earthquake is not a major hazard for \nBangladesh.2 However, Bangladesh is surrounded by regions of high seismicity with numerous active \nfaults,  including  the  Dauki  Fault  system.  Inadequate  detailed  design  drawings,  poor  quality  of \nconstruction, lack of proper supervision, and lack of enforcement of building codes and regulations \nhave  made  areas  in  Bangladesh  vulnerable  to  earthquake.3 In  particular,  there  is  a  growing \napprehension that a moderate to severe earthquake in any of the major cities of Bangladesh may result \nin a devastating loss of life and property.  \n \n16.  Table 7 lists the number of earthquakes (both main shocks and total events) from variety of \nsources, including counts of events within Bangladesh borders (both during the entire reported history \nand within the last 100 years, i.e., 1913\u20132013). The impact of earthquake in Bangladesh can lead to \nmany hazards, including ground shaking, liquefaction, fire following earthquake, ground subsidence, \ntsunamis, seiches, and landslides. Primarily due to its low-lying deltaic geography, the main hazard from \nearthquake in Bangladesh is ground shaking. In general, for many parts of Bangladesh, in particular the \nnorth and east, the seismic hazard is considered to be high.  \n \n17.

In addition to weather-related hazards such as tropical cyclones and floods, Bangladesh is \nfrequently exposed to severe storms, which are typically local thunderstorms known as kal-baishakhi. \nThey occur from late February to early June, and the frequency of severe kal-baishakhi usually reaches \na maximum in April. Kal-baishakhi are generally associated with squalls (strong winds), torrential rain, \ntornadoes, hail, and lightning. Overall, the frequency of severe storms in Bangladesh is high, with an \naverage of over 150 events estimated per year. The majority of severe storms have been reported in \ncentral Bangladesh, although occurrence is generally well distributed throughout the country. \n \n19.  Since 1951, at least 20 severe storm events in Bangladesh have resulted in 100 or more \nreported lives lost. Of these, three events have reportedly caused 1,000 or more lives lost, including the \ntornadoes in 1964, 1973, and 1989. The destructive Daulatpur\u2013Saturia tornado in 1989 that occurred in \nthe Manikganj District on 26 April is considered one of the deadliest tornadoes in Bangladesh\u2019s history \nwith around 1,300 lives lost. The most severe event in terms of people affected was thunderstorms \nwith hailstorm and rain on 7\u20138 January 1993 in the northern region of Bangladesh, which affected \n750,000 people. Most events are very localized and thus affect smaller population size relative to \ntropical cyclones and floods. The most severe event in terms of reported economic damage is a \ntornado that struck Madaripur and Faridpur on 1 April 1977, with a reported estimated damage of \n$50 million. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(cid:3)", "Disaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh  9 \n \nF.

Major disasters in Bangladesh during \n2000\u20132013 have resulted in about $771 million in losses, 7.1 million people affected, and 600 lives lost \non average per year. \n \n ", "10  ADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n \nIII.      TROPICAL CYCLONE AND FLOOD RISK MODEL  \nOF BANGLADESH \n \n22.  To estimate the financial impact of disasters, the technical assistance (TA) developed risk \nmodels of tropical cyclones and floods in Bangladesh. The risk models in Table 10 and Figure 2 \nestimate the financial impact due to damage and loss for all sectors in Bangladesh. The flood losses \nwere inferred from an analysis of historical flood data. The tropical cyclone losses are derived from the \ndetailed probabilistic AIR tropical cyclone risk model.4 \n \n23.  As shown in Table 10 and Figure 2, Bangladesh is expected to incur a financial impact of about \n$3.2  billion  on  average  per  year  due  to  cyclone  and  flood,  or  about  2.2%  of  the  2014  GDP. \nFurthermore, there is a 1% chance that the financial impact from cyclones will exceed $7.2 billion in \nany year, and a 1% chance that the financial impact from floods will exceed $12.4 billion in any year. It is \nexpected that the financial risk from other perils such as severe storm and earthquake is much less \nsevere than that of cyclone and flood. \n \n24.  Based on the estimated risk profile, the flooding in 2004 represents a 10-year event (i.e., the \nlevel of loss incurred by the 2004 floods is expected to be exceeded on average once every 10 years). \nThe 2007 tropical cyclone Sidr is expected to be a 20-year event, 2009 cyclone Aila a 5-year event, \nand 2013 cyclone Mahasen a 2-year event.

Probabilistic risk models provide information on the risk of natural hazards, since \nthey quantify the likelihood of future catastrophe events and consequences by computing loss potentials that go beyond \nthe available historical record. Information derived from catastrophe risk models can also overcome the limitations  \nand data gaps of reported observations of past events. The AIR tropical cyclone model for Bangladesh captures the \neffects of tropical cyclone-induced winds and flooding from tropical cyclone-induced precipitation on properties in \nBangladesh. It is a stochastic, event-based model designed for portfolio risk assessment. Details of the AIR tropical \ncyclone model are in ADB. 2015. Capacity Building for Disaster Finance in Bangladesh.

One of the TA\u2019s key questions is whether losses and damages from disasters were adequately \nfunded, and if so, from what sources. To answer the question, the TA conducted a funding gap \nanalysis.  A  funding  gap  is  defined  as  the  residual  between  total  annual  losses  incurred  as  a \nconsequence  of  disasters  and  funding  available  to  meet  those  losses.  Full  identification  of  the \nresources allocated to disaster risk is assessed, which can be shown to encourage the government and \nprivate  sector  that  greater  investment  in  risk  reduction  in  general  and  ex  ante  disaster  finance \ninstruments in particular is economically rational. \n \n26.  The funding gap analysis presented here relies on the data related to the catastrophes in \nBangladesh from 2000 to 2013. The damage information relates to reported monetary damages \ncaused by four different types of perils\u2014tropical cyclones, earthquakes, storms, and floods. The \ndamage data represent the total economic loss sustained by all sectors; the resulting funding gap \nillustrates total gap borne by both private and public sectors.5 \n \n27.  The funding information is comprised of three components of funding for (i) recovery and \nrehabilitation  projects,  (ii)  humanitarian  aid,  and  (iii)  foreign  aid  on  disaster-related  emergency \nresponse. \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n5  There was no reliable data available to provide a clear distinction of responsibility between public and private losses. \nBased on some experts polled in this report, the public sector damage is, in general, approximated at 85% of the total \ndamage and could potentially be used to infer the portion of the government\u2019s catastrophe responsibility. ", "12  ADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n \nB.  Funding for Recovery and Rehabilitation Projects \n \n28.  The projects for recovery, rehabilitation, and prevention cover a variety of areas including \n \n(cid:882)(cid:3) maintenance, rehabilitation, and restoration of flood-affected educational building (e.g., \nprimary, secondary, higher secondary schools) and other urban infrastructure; \n(cid:882)(cid:3) house construction for flood-affected landless people; \n(cid:882)(cid:3) recovery and restoration projects for agricultural crops; and \n(cid:882)(cid:3) other emergency cyclone recovery and rehabilitation projects.6 \n \n29.  The total procurement cost of those 55 projects during 2000\u20132013 is $897 million. Of those, \n29 are supported by international donors and aid agencies. Foreign contributors financed 61% of the \nprocurement cost; the rest was domestically financed.  \n \n30.  Focusing  on  each  year,  Figure  3  demonstrates  that  the  total  amount  of  recovery  and \nrehabilitation funding for the damages caused by the major perils of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, and \n2009 remained extremely modest, i.e., below $100 million per year in most cases. The 2010\u20132013 \nperiod witnessed an average funding allocations of about $50 million per year despite the absence of \nany major peril. The available information on projects suggests that this is because some of the \nrecovery and rehabilitation efforts following the 2007 tropical cyclone Sidr and 2009 cyclone Aila \nspilled over to 2010\u20132013. \n \n \nFigure 3: Funding for Recovery and Rehabilitation Projects in Bangladesh, 2000\u20132013\n($ million) \n300\ns\nt\nc\ne\noj 200\nr\nP\nr \no\ng f\nn 100\ndi\nn\nu\nF\n0\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nYear\n \nSource: ADB. 2015.

Humanitarian Aid \n \n31.  An important component of available funding in the case of catastrophes is humanitarian aid.7 \nThe  information  compiled  by  Financial  Tracking  Service  of  the  United  Nations  Office  for  the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs suggests that more than 95% of the humanitarian aid that flows \ninto Bangladesh is in response to natural hazards.8 \n \n32.  Figure 4 indicates that 2007 had the highest amount of humanitarian aid, i.e., almost $300 \nmillion, followed by 2004 with around $100 million. Other years, including 2009 (cyclone Aila), saw \nrelatively low amounts of humanitarian aid. The available information suggests that the pre-2007 \nhumanitarian aid average was $20.5 million per annum, while post-2007 average nearly doubled to \n$37 million per annum. The long-term humanitarian aid corresponds to a total of $679 million during \n2000\u20132013. \n \n \nFigure 4: Humanitarian Aid into Bangladesh,2000\u20132013 \n($ million) \nd\nAi 300\nn \na\nri\na\nnit 200\na\nm\nu\nH\nr  100\no\ng f\nn\ndi\nn 0\nu\nF\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nYear\n \nSources: ADB. 2015.

Funding from Foreign Aid on Disaster-Related Emergency Response \n \n33.  Bangladesh receives one of the highest amounts of foreign aid on disaster-related emergency \nresponse in the world. Figure 5 portrays the annual foreign aid on disaster-related emergency response \nfor Bangladesh for 2002 and 2013. It is evident that emergency-related foreign aid is significant only in \nmajor disaster years. The 2007 tropical cyclone Sidr witnessed more than $600 million worth of \nforeign aid mainly for rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance, and several supplemental financing \nfor floods and municipal services. Turning to the other years, 2004 saw $209 million in disaster-related \nforeign aid, while 2008 had $186 million and 2009 had $52 million.

The total disaster-related foreign aid into Bangladesh during 2002\u20132012 is $1.1 billion. The \nforeign aid figures on disaster-related emergency support for 2000, 2001, and 2013 were not available; \nhowever,  the  unavailability  of  data  for  these  years  is  unlikely  to  make  a  difference  to  the  key \nconclusions given that there were no major disasters in those years. \n \nE.  Funding Gap \n \n35.  Table 11 summarizes the disaster-related economic loses, available funding, and disparity \nbetween the two. It consists of total annual economic costs (loss and damage) for flood, severe storm, \nearthquake,  and  tropical  cyclone.  The  table  documents  the  funding  amounts  for  recovery  and \nrehabilitation projects, the humanitarian aid into  Bangladesh,  and foreign  aid on disaster-related \nemergency  response.  The  sum  of  these  three  funding  components  makes  up  the  total  funding \navailable to Bangladesh in the case of catastrophes. Finally, the disparity between total damage and \ntotal funding constitutes the funding gap. \n \n36.  Figure  6  presents  the  sum  of  funding  amounts  for  recovery  and  rehabilitation  projects, \nhumanitarian aid, and foreign aid on disaster-related emergency response. The total funding for over \n14 years from 2000 to 2013 is $2.7 billion.  \n \n37.  Figure  7  documents  the  funding  gap  of  $8.1  billion  in  Bangladesh  during  2000\u20132013. \nConcomitant with the sizeable economic impacts, the funding gap was $2 billion in 2004, $1.7 billion \nin 2007, and $1 billion in 2009. Even 2000 and 2012 experienced sizeable funding gaps of slightly \nmore than $500 million each. The funding gap was close to zero in 2001, 2005, and 2011, and even \nnegative in 2006 and 2008 as Bangladesh experienced an average funding surplus of $119 million.  \n \n \n \n \n(cid:3)", "Disaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh  15 \n \nTable 11: Disaster-Related Economic Impact and Funding Gap in Bangladesh, 2000\u20132013 \n($ million) \nDisaster-Related Funding\nDisaster- Funding for  Foreign Aid on \nRelated  Recovery and  Disaster-Related \nEconomic  Rehabilitation  Humanitarian  Emergency  Total  Funding \nYear  Impact  Projects  Aid  Response  Funding  Gap \n2000  582  61  5 \u2026 66  516\n2001  85  67  2 \u2026 69  16\n2002  1,072  129  6 0 135  937\n2003  1,042  8  4 0 11  1,030\n2004  2,335  60  109 209 378  1,957\n2005  139  95  6 0 101  38\n2006  27  58  12 0 71  (44)\n2007  2,744  73  300 645 1,018  1,726\n2008  145  111  43 186 339  (194)\n2009  1,206  38  37 52 128  1,078\n2010  254  52  31 1 84  170\n2011  186  64  66 0 131  55\n2012  626  47  32 0.2 79  547\n2013  350  34  26 \u2026 60  290\nTotal  10,793  897  679 1,093 2,670  8,122\n(  ) = negative, \u2026 = not available. \nSource: ADB. 2015.

The funding gap analysis concludes that Bangladesh is vulnerable to major catastrophes in \nterms of sizeable funding gaps in major disaster years. Although the country runs small funding deficits \nor  surpluses  in  the  years  without  major  disasters,  the  long-run  funding  gap  is  very  substantial, \namounting to more than $8 billion during 2000\u20132013 (Figure 7). This funding deficit arose because \nonly around a quarter of the $10.8 billion total disaster-related damage is covered by the total available \nfunding in the said period. Of the $2.7 billion total available funding that has been reliably identified, \n$897 million came from recovery and rehabilitation projects, $679 million from humanitarian aid, and \n$1,093 million from foreign aid on disaster-related emergency response. Only 13% of the total available \nfunding was generated internally. It is estimated that there may have been additional expenditure that \nwas not identified due to data gaps. Thus, the total disaster-related expenditure could have been \nhigher. \n \n \nFigure 7: Funding Gap of Catastrophes in Bangladesh, 2000\u20132013 \n($ million) \n2,000\n1,500\np\na 1,000\nG\ng \nn\ndi\nun 500\nF\n0\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n\u2013500 Year\n \nSource: ADB. 2015.

Government \n \n39.  The Finance Division in the Ministry of Finance is the core body that allocates the domestic \ndisaster-related  funding  across  different  governmental  and  nongovernmental  layers.9 Budgetary \nmatters including allocations are outlined in the annual budget document at the beginning of each \nfinancial year. In particular, the Finance Division allocates the required budget to each line ministry, \nwhich adds up to the central government budget.  \n \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n9  Disaster risk financing in this section refers to both ex ante and ex post financing instruments for disasters. \n(cid:3)", "Disaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh  17 \n \n40.  The budgetary system in Bangladesh involves several small pockets of money dedicated to \ndisaster management. Some of the identified pockets are as follows: \n \n(i)(cid:3) Disaster Risk Reduction Fund. It is dedicated specifically for disaster risk reduction. \nThe amount available could not be identified but is likely to be modest. \n(ii)(cid:3) Emergency Fund Disaster Management. It is allocated to Deputy Commissioner at the \ndistrict level. The amount is confirmed to be small. \n(iii)(cid:3) Fund for Unforeseen Incidents. It is available each year amounting to one billion taka \n(approximately $14.28 million). This funding can be allocated for any purpose in an \nordinary year. \n(iv)(cid:3) Palli  Karma-Sahayak  Foundation.  It  is  a  microfinance  wholesaler  and  implements \nClimate Resilience Fund under the Ministry of Finance. Headed by the Ministry, a high-\nlevel committee decides on the distribution of funds to participating nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs).  \n \n41.  When there is a domestic funding gap following catastrophes, typically the foreign financing \nmechanism is initiated. The Economic Relations Division of the Ministry of Finance mobilizes foreign \nfinancing through multilateral and bilateral development partners. The process works in a way in which \nline  ministries  approach  the  Economic  Relations  Division  for  emergency  financing,  which  then \nactivates bilateral links to meet the requirements. The coverage of foreign aid includes infrastructure \nprojects; procurement of food; social, sanitation, healthcare, and education support projects; and \ncyclone shelters program.  \n \nB.  Bangladesh Bank (Central Bank) \n \n42.  The role of Bangladesh Bank in disaster risk management is related to its environmental and \nsocially responsible central banking approach. It issued Green Banking Policy covering Green Finance, \nClimate Risk Fund, In-house Environmental Management, and Green Banking Policy at strategic level \nof  banks  and  financial  institutions.  Bangladesh  Bank  issued  Environmental  Risk  Management \nGuidelines to banks and financial institutions to assess environmental risk in their credit portfolio.  \n \n43.  As a pioneering initiative, Bangladesh Bank created a separate fund named Bangladesh Bank \nDisaster Management and Corporate Social Responsibility Fund in 2013. This fund is utilized for \ncapacity building in different disaster risk management and socially responsible projects. Under this \nfund, it is envisaged that each of the 88 institutions deposit Tk50 million, potentially adding to \nTk4.5 billion (approximately $64.3 million), that could be made available for postdisaster response, \ndisaster risk management, and capacity building. \n \nC.  Insurance Sector \n \n44.  Bangladesh insurance market is dominated by two state-owned corporations\u2014Sadharan Bima \nCorporation for general insurance and Jiban Bima Corporation for life insurance. A total of 31 private \nlife and 46 private general insurance companies also operate in this market, and 12 life insurers and 2 \ngeneral insurers offer microinsurance. The microinsurance products offered by the general insurance \ncompanies are health and flood insurance.  \n \n ", "18  ADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n \n45.  Currently,  a  vast  majority  of  the  population,  especially  in  rural  areas,  is  left  outside  the \ninsurance  coverage  in  Bangladesh  due  to  lack  of  awareness.  However,  there  have  been  recent \ndevelopments to improve access among poor and vulnerable communities to financing tools that \npromote resilience and reduce (O\u2019Donnell 2009) economic losses due to disasters. Several leading \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs), including Grameen Bank and Proshika, have implemented small-\nscale  livestock  microinsurance  programs  to  protect  their  investment  loans  for  dairy  cattle  and \nwater buffalo livestock producers. Typically the insurance provides all risk mortality cover during the  \n2\u20133-year loan repayment period, and the sum insured is fixed in accordance with the loan amount. \nThe MFIs operate their own internal livestock indemnity funds without any form of catastrophe \nreinsurance protection (FAO 2011). \n \n46.  There is a \u201cmeso-level\u201d index-based flood insurance being piloted in Sirajganj area by Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation, Oxfam, Pragati General Insurance, Palli Karma-Sahayak \nFoundation (PKSF), Manab Mukti Sangstha and Swiss Re. The insurance coverage is for the peak flood \nperiod (16 August\u201330 September), and maximum payout is Tk8,000. There are four levels of payout \ndepending on the flood water level and the number of days the water level remains high. The project \nwas launched in 2013 and covers 1,661 households. The premium is paid by the Swiss Agency for \nDevelopment and Cooperation. The insurers have made a payout in 2014, but details are not available. \nA few other index-based products are being piloted by international donors. \n \nD.  Microfinance Sector \n \n47.  MFIs can potentially play significant roles in disaster risk management. MFIs offer a number of \nservices, which can help clients in coping with the impact of catastrophes. The services include \nprovision of temporary loans, loan forgiveness, rescheduling of loan, asset replacement, housing loans, \nand loans for starting new activities.  \n \n48.  Currently, there are 742 registered MFIs with the Microcredit Regulatory Authority. MFIs \nhave over 26.4 million members and 19.7 million borrowers. As of May 2014, loans amounted to \nTk257.01 billion (approximately $3.3 billion) and savings amounted to Tk94 billion (approximately \n$1.2 billion).  The  total  number  of  cooperatives  was  164,536  with  over  8.6  million  members  and \ndeposits in excess of Tk29.4 billion (approximately $378.3 million). \n \n49.  Disasters can have a profound impact on microcredit operations. For example, during the 1998 \nfloods, 1.2 million members of Grameen Bank were affected, of which 0.8 million were seriously \naffected. Activities funded through loans were destroyed, and Grameen Bank faced severe liquidity \nissue and had to take Tk1 billion (approximately $12.9 million) loan from Bangladesh Bank to cope \nwith the events.

Those members who did not receive \nhousing loans before were given Tk2,500 (approximately $32.20).  \n \n50.  BRAC, a microfinance NGO, has made specific arrangements for flood disasters: (i) clients can \nwithdraw  savings  up  to  a  specific  pre-established  amount;  (ii)  regular  loan  repayments  can  be \nsuspended; (iii) interest rates can be reduced for up to 2 months; (iv) loans can be restructured for \nclients with marginal disaster losses; (v) loans can be refinanced for clients with high disaster losses; \n(vi) new loans are offered for productive asset replacement of up to 12 months at 15% interest; and \n(vii) an option of disbursement in the form of seeds, animals, and other in-kind materials is also \navailable. After the 1998 floods, BRAC extended loans to 240,000 families for repairing and rebuilding \nhomes.  \n(cid:3)", "Disaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh  19 \n \n51.  PKSF has seven microinsurance programs including credit life, livestock, hospital cash plan, and \nparametric healthcare. PKSF has established a Covariant Risk Fund to protect partner organizations \nthat do not have any insurance or reinsurance coverage. PKSF has also set up a Disaster Management \nProgram under which it waives the entire outstanding loan amount if the income-earning person in the \nhousehold is killed due to a disaster. This is an important risk management approach because PKSF\u2019s \nmicrocredit programs have a total outreach of 35 million people. To help them cope with and recover \nfrom disasters, PKSF has created a fund called SAHOS (\"courage\u201d in Bangla) under its Disaster \nManagement Program to provide quick financial assistance to the poor families. SAHOS provides \nemergency  medical  services,  water,  and  sanitation.  As  of  June  2014,  149  partner  organizations \nparticipated in this program, and they disbursed Tk5.0 billion (approximately $63 million) to 120,698 \nborrowers. Most of the loans were made during tropical cyclone Sidr (2007) and cyclone Aila (2009). \n \n52.

Also, the fund can be used to provide supplemental loans to \nborrowers when their productive assets are damaged or stolen. Finally, when a loan is more than \n6 months overdue, the reserve fund can be applied to the balance. \n \n \nVI.      DISASTER RISK FINANCE OPTIONS FOR BANGLADESH \n \nA.  Analyzing Risk and Identifying Needs \n \n53.  Catastrophes have a significant impact on Bangladesh\u2019s GDP growth. The 100-year loss (a loss \nexpected to happen once every 100 years) for flood is equivalent to 8%\u20139% of GDP, and for tropical \ncyclone around 5% of GDP. Given the low penetration rate of individual and business insurance and \nthe lack of alternative financial coping mechanisms for catastrophes, the sovereign responsibility and \nthe amount of risk which needs to be financed by the state are large. \n \n54.  With Figure 7 in the previous section, one can differentiate various levels of need and suitable \nfinancing mechanisms. In Figure 8, the lower area covers the funding gap which is best managed \nthrough internal budgetary and reserve mechanisms. In some years, a more significant funding gap \noccurs (i.e., greater than $250 million), requiring an alternative risk financing mechanism such as \ncontingent credit (middle part). Then finally once every 5\u201310 years or more, major disaster events will \nrequire some sort of risk transfer mechanism as the quantum of losses will be too large to be financed \nthrough reserve or contingent credit mechanisms. Such risk transfer can be in both public and private \nsectors. \n \nB.  Breaking Down the Funding Gap \n \n55.  Building on the analysis above, Figure 9 shows the relative contribution of government and \nnongovernment  sectors  to  the  1-in-100-year  cyclone  loss  estimate  from  the  cyclone  model. \nGovernment losses are further split into emergency (i.e., immediate), medium term (up to 6 months), \nand long-term. The 6-month time frame is generally taken as the transition from recovery to long-term \nrebuilding  phases,  and  coincides  with  the  minimum  time  generally  taken  to  mobilize  rebuilding \nfinancing from the international development financing institutions. NGO and MFI damage and loss is \naddressed predominantly in medium-term response while the private sector covers both medium and \nlong-term response.

As shown in Figure 9, around 50% of the financing is required for long-term rebuilding, and \naround 30%\u201335% for medium-term recovery investment. \n \n57.  Taking this analysis a step further, the project estimated the relative portion of the funding gap \nof the five categories identified above. Figure 10 provides the relative breakdown of the total funding \ngap for a 1-in-100-year cyclone event, assuming that the funding gap is 50% of the total modeled loss. \n \n58.  This analysis suggests that the funding gap is predominantly focused on the medium-term \nsovereign needs and the needs of the NGO and MFI sector, which are also in the medium term. This \nsuggests that risk financing solution for the government and NGO and MFI sector in the 1\u20136 months \npostdisaster period are most appropriate. \n \nC.  Practical Implementable Solutions \n \n1.  Sovereign Options \n \n59.  Two sovereign disaster risk financing options are most practical for the short to medium term \nin Bangladesh\u2014contingent credit and parametric risk transfer for cyclone or flood. Contingent credit \nwould be deployed to complement internal budgetary mechanisms for response to more frequent \nevents, while parametric risk transfer would deal with less frequent events (i.e., 1 in 10 annualized \nprobability and less frequent) and could provide rapid liquidity to support early recovery. \n \n \n \n ", "22  ADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n \na.  Contingent Credit \n \n60.  A contingent credit line on pre-agreed terms, which can be made rapidly available using a \ntrigger,  could  provide  a  useful  complement  to  emergency  response  funds  set  aside  as  budget \ncontingencies at the national level. It will also reduce the uncertainty associated with international \ndonor-driven emergency response mechanisms. For better risk management, a contingent credit line \ncan  be  combined  with  capacity  building  in  disaster  preparedness  and  early  warning,  including \ndevelopment of pre-agreed contingency and recovery plans. \n \n61.  The key likely elements of a contingent credit line are the following: \n \n(i)(cid:3) Stand-alone or contingent extension. The credit line is structured as a stand-alone or \ncontingent extension of a normal funding window, likely a loan for investment in disaster \nrisk management. \n(ii)(cid:3) Pre-agreed trigger. An example of this trigger is a declaration of emergency by the \nnational government. \n(iii)(cid:3) Cap on contingent credit amount. A $250 million credit facility would approximately \nmatch the Government of Bangladesh\u2019s capacity in the form of reserve funds and budget \nreallocations,  and  these  together  could  cover  around  half  of  the  funding  gap  for \nmedium-term recovery for a 1-in-100-year tropical cyclone disaster (Figure 8). Partial \ndrawdown would be allowable. \n \nb.  Parametric Sovereign Risk Transfer \n \n62.  A risk transfer product would be appropriate for relatively infrequent but large-impact events. \nThe TA developed an example in which the insurance policy trigger is set at the 1-in-10-year loss level \n(for each of the covered perils separately), and payout will increase pro-rate basis until the coverage \nlimit reaches to the paid out level for a 1-in-100-year event. This is a typical structure for a sovereign \nparametric product, maximizing the relative cost-effectiveness of risk transfer but also allowing for a \npayout probability acceptable at the political level. \n \n63.  For simplicity, the two perils, flood and cyclone, are treated as independent perils and have \nstand-alone  policies  and  stand-alone  pricing.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  while  flood  cover  is \naddressed here based on the risk profile presented above, there is currently no sovereign parametric \nflood model in existence anywhere in the world, and it will take several years before one is developed \nand accepted by the markets. \n \n64.  Given the stated target for a sovereign risk transfer product, the full national loss profile has \nbeen downscaled to 25% of the total losses, which approximates the portion of losses requiring \nfinancing during the medium-term recovery phase (Figure 9). Figure 11 shows the full exceedance \nprobability curves for flood and cyclone used as a basis for structuring the risk transfer product. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(cid:3)", "Disaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh  23 \n \nFigure 11: Exceedance Probability Curves for Government Response Costs  \nRepresenting 25% of the Full Modeled National Loss \n4,500\nn) 4,000\no\nmilli 3,500\n$ \n(\ns  3,000\ns\no\nL\nnt  2,500\ne\nm\nn 2,000\nr\ne\nv\nGo 1,500 Cyclone\nd \ne\nt 1,000\na\nm Flood\nsti 500\nE\n0\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\nReturn Period (Years)\n \nSource: ADB. 2015.

In this example, premium has been fixed at $20 million per peril, giving a coverage limit of \n$340 million for flood and $357 million for cyclone. Doubling premium will double not only the \ncoverage limit but also the payout for any event which triggers the policy (i.e., losses greater than the \nattachment point).  \n \n67.  Actual pricing of a product will depend on a variety of structuring and market factors which can \nbe better determined only once a product is developed and placement is considered. However, the \npricing range utilized above is felt to be reasonably stable\u2014certainly in the coming few years\u2014and ", "24  ADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n \nthere is high confidence of global market appetite for sovereign risk from countries such as Bangladesh, \nassuming that the underlying parametric model is well-understood and accepted and the product is \nstructured appropriately. \n \n2.  Nonsovereign Options \n \n68.  Helping the population to help themselves is a highly efficient way of reducing the burden on \nthe government when disaster strikes. Traditional property, and catastrophe and agricultural insurance \nmarkets are not well developed in Bangladesh and appear unlikely to scale up quickly. However, the \nrelatively strong microfinance sector means that microinsurance, particularly weather index insurance, \nis likely to be the most appropriate tools for expanding markets in Bangladesh. \n \n69.  Building on the microfinance platform, index-based weather products at the individual and \nespecially at the portfolio level should be primary targets for support. While piloting and eventual \nexpansion  of  individual  microinsurance  products  such  as  Oxfam\u2019s  index-based  flood  insurance \nprogram are worthy of support, experience from around the world demonstrates that reaching scale \nand economic sustainability is a long process. A more direct route to supporting large portions of the \nlow-income population is through meso-level coverage, of portfolios of micro-loans. \n \n70.  Substantial  natural  catastrophe  risk  resides  in  the  loan  portfolios  of  the  MFI  sector. \nAppropriate  management  of  this  risk  provides  dual  benefits\u2014it  protects  against  low-income \nindividuals  sliding  into  greater  hardship  after  a  major  disaster,  while  also  potentially  catalyzing \neconomic activity through providing additional financing to MFI clients. \n \n71.  The MFI sector in Bangladesh already has an established insurance element and can thus be a \nstrong partner in disaster risk financing, although the catastrophe exposure of MFIs must be managed \nvery differently to credit life or health insurance, which are the predominant forms of insurance \ncurrently offered by MFIs. Portfolio protection for MFIs would bring a rapid influx of new liquidity after \nmajor loan-stressing events. This would enable not only restructuring of existing loans but, more \nimportantly, distribution of new loans. New capital influx through existing channels to existing (good) \nMFI clients has a large multiplying effect in generating economic activity and allowing the long-term \nreconstruction financing to run through local markets, not bypass them. \n \n72.  The  total  outstanding  loan  balance  in  the  MFI  sector  is  estimated  around  $3.5  billion. \nAssuming that 90% of the loans are climate-exposed, there is an overall exposure of $3.15 billion. The \nnational modeled loss rate relative to GDP for a 1-in-100-year event is just under 5% for cyclone and \nalmost 8.5% for flood. Taking into account the relatively higher vulnerability of NGO and MFI clients \nagainst national exposure, a loss rate of 10% for a 1-in-100-year event seems reasonable, leading to a \nloss or impairment against the national NGO and MFI loan portfolio of $315 million. If fully covered, \nthis would comprise around 60% of the identified funding gap for the MFIs and NGOs (Figure 10). \n \n73.  However, a number of elements would need to be in place for such a scheme to be viable, \nincluding \n \n(i)(cid:3) compulsory participation of all MFIs with climate-exposed loan portfolios, implemented \nalongside a simple risk assessment process to identify and quantify the covariant weather \nrisk of each MFI; \n(cid:3)", "Disaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh  25 \n \n(ii)(cid:3) a  simple  parametric  product  structure  at  the  MFI  level,  such  that  the  particular \nvulnerabilities and geographic distribution of the loan portfolio can be captured but \nwithout the detailed and costly risk analysis; \n(iii)(cid:3) a constant rating structure and an efficient vehicle to underwrite cover and pool the risk; \n(iv)(cid:3) capitalization of the risk pool; and \n(v)(cid:3) technical assistance program and required contingency planning for MFIs to ensure that \nbenefits of risk transfer are passed on to clients. \n \n74.  PKSF\u2019s Covariant Risk Fund would appear to provide a significant head start on a number of \nthese critical components of a portfolio microinsurance pool, although experience from elsewhere in \nthe region and globally would need to be closely investigated to ensure that any program would be \nsustainable in the medium to long term. \n \n \nVII.      RECOMMENDATIONS \n \n75.  Uncovered  financial  risk  from  disasters  places  a  significant  downward  pressure  on  the \ncountry\u2019s economic growth. Financial costs from disasters are sudden and catastrophic and aggravate \ndirect disaster impacts. Thus, it is necessary to integrate disaster risk financing strategies into the \noverall  disaster  risk  management  and  public  finance  management  to  minimize  the  financial  and \neconomic consequences of disasters for the households, the private sectors, and the government. \n \n76.  Based on the risk profiles and present institutional and policy context, three specific disaster \nrisk finance options are identified for Bangladesh\u2014sovereign contingency credit, direct sovereign risk \ntransfer to the international market, and microfinance portfolio protection to provide risk financing for \nthe low-income population.  \n \n77.  Policy makers, regulators, and private sectors are strongly recommended to consider adopting \ndisaster risk financing options that are suitable to each institution\u2019s mandate and capacity. The three \noptions  are  recommended  as  feasible  options  that  can  be  implemented  with  little  or  moderate \ninvestment under the present Bangladesh environment. \n \n78.  In addition to the options, policy makers, in particular budget policy makers, are recommended \nto develop appropriate financial management policies for disasters, including \n \n(i)(cid:3) ensuring integrating disaster risk financing strategies into the overall disaster risk \nmanagement and public finance management; \n(ii)(cid:3) assessing the fiscal impacts of disaster risks; \n(iii)(cid:3) developing clear rules and systems on postdisaster financial arrangements, including \nrapid and accountable relief, recovery, and reconstruction resource distribution; \n(iv)(cid:3) promoting sound financial sector and microfinance sector development with respect to \ndisaster risks including proper regulation, business continuity, and contingency planning; \nand \n(v)(cid:3) providing continuous information dissemination and training activities on disaster risks \nto  various  stakeholders,  such  as  disaster  risk  management  related  agencies,  banks, \nfinancial institutions, NGOs, and MFIs. \n \n \n   ", "26  ADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n \nREFERENCES \n \n \nADB. 2015.
