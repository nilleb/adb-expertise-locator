Financial \nprotection  from  disasters,  i.e.,  disaster  risk  financing,  has  increasingly  been  applied  in  developed \ncountries.  However,  the  application  of  ex  ante  disaster  risk  financing  is  very  scarce  in  developing \ncountries including Bangladesh. Bangladesh is disaster-prone, with floods and cyclones being the most \nfrequent and severe danger. Based on historical data, natural hazard events in Bangladesh cost more \nthan  $10  billion  economic  losses  from  2000  to  2013,  but  the  total  funding  available  for  relief, \nrehabilitation,  and  reconstruction  for  the  same  period  was  $2  billion  only.  It  is  estimated  that \nBangladesh will incur a financial impact of about $3.2 billion on average per year due to cyclone and \nflood, or about 2.2% of gross domestic product. Bangladesh urgently needs to develop ex ante disaster \nrisk  financing  solutions  to  minimize  economic  impacts  of  catastrophes.  Currently,  three  disaster  risk \nfinance  solutions  are  considered  effective  in  Bangladesh:  sovereign  disaster  risk  contingent  credit, \nparametric sovereign risk insurance, and disaster risk microfinance portfolio insurance. \n \n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n\f(cid:3)\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n\n \n \nTo  develop  a  strategy  for  effective  ex  ante  disaster  risk  financing  solutions  for  Bangladesh,  the  \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for \nDisaster Risk Finance (TA 8144-BAN) in August 2012 to the Government of Bangladesh. The TA work \nwas  carried  out  by  the  team  from  AIR Worldwide,  which  comprised  of  Akshay  Gupta  (disaster  risk \nfinance  specialist  and  team  leader),  Mehmet  Ulubasoglu  (public  disaster  risk  finance  specialist), \nPeeranan Towashiraporn (disaster risk profiling specialist), Simon Young (financial sector and capital \nmarket  specialist),  Mosleh  Uddin  Ahmed  (financial  sector  and  capital  market  specialist),  Khondoker \nTawhid  (capacity  development  and  knowledge  management  specialist),  Md.

INTRODUCTION \n\n \n1. \nDisaster  risk  has  broad  social  and  developmental  implications.  However,  in  many  countries, \nfinancial  protection  in  disaster  risk  management  is  still  limited,  causing  delayed  recovery  and \nreconstruction and worsening their socioeconomic impacts. Disaster risk financing requires developing \ndifferent  options  according  to  the  nature  of  the  disaster;  the  probability  of  occurrence;  and  the \npotential loss of, or impact on, life and physical capital. Take-up rates for disaster risk financing options \nare minimum in many developing countries. Adequate market-based disaster risk mitigation products \ndo not exist for certain perils in many countries, including Bangladesh. \n \n2. \nUncovered  or  unfunded  catastrophe  losses  do  not  simply  dissipate  after  a  catastrophe,  but \ninstead are paid by domestic taxpayers or international donors  in the form of  ex post (after the fact) \nrelief,  recovery,  and  reconstruction  expenses.  Closing  the  gap  between  funded  and  unfunded \ncatastrophe losses using the combination of appropriately designed disaster risk financing mechanisms \nis  crucial  for  robust  disaster  risk  management  and,  in  many  disaster-prone  countries,  sustainable \ndevelopment itself. This is especially true for Bangladesh, which has limited budgetary resources and \nlimited markets to support the proactive transfer of catastrophe risk. Sovereign entities should pay due \nconsideration to the aggregate economic exposure to catastrophes. Due to the recent socioeconomic \nchanges,  including  rapid  urbanization  and  climate  change,  a  holistic  approach  to  disaster  risk \nmanagement, including disaster risk financing, becomes even more important. \n \n3. \nFor Bangladesh, natural catastrophe risk is a considerable problem due to the population\u2019s low \nlevel  of  resilience  and  the  high  exposure  to  multiple  hydrometeorological  hazards,  including  tropical \ncyclones and extreme high rainfall leading to flooding. \n \n4. \nAdded  to  the  high  risk  is  the  lack  of  disaster  insurance  mechanisms  among  the  general \npopulation.  In  Bangladesh,  like  in  many  developing  countries,  only  a  few  of  the  country\u2019s  assets  are \ninsured,  thus  leaving  a  huge  burden  on  the  government  to  fund  postdisaster  response  and  recovery. \nAgain,  in  the  case  of  Bangladesh,  formal  insurance  mechanisms  for  catastrophes  are  very  poorly \ndeveloped, and traditional informal mechanism of risk-sharing is unable to respond when major natural \ndisasters occur. \n \n5. \nOne  of  the  challenges  in  natural  catastrophe  risk  management  is  climate  change.  In  many \nplaces  around  the  world,  particularly  in  low-lying  coastal  countries  such  as  Bangladesh,  increasing \nglobal  air  and  ocean  temperatures  will  inevitably  lead  to  greater  impacts  of  hydrometeorological \nevents. While tropical cyclone activity itself may not increase, increased sea level will lead to greater \nstorm  surge.  Climate  change  may  not  be  responsible  for  much  of  the  current  exposure  to \nhydrometeorological hazards in Bangladesh, but it will contribute to an increased risk and should serve \nas  a  call  for  action.  Effective  risk  management  strategies  put  in  place  early  will  provide  a  strong \nplatform for managing the increasing risk already being felt in other parts of Asia. \n \n \n\nII.      DISASTERS AND THEIR IMPACTS IN BANGLADESH \n\n \nA.  Overview \n \n6. \nBangladesh is one of the most at-risk countries in the world to natural hazards, mainly due to \nits  high  population  density,  low-lying  topography,  and  geographical  location  (active  monsoon  and \n\n\fADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n\n2 \n \n\ntropical  cyclone  basin).  Bangladesh  is  regularly  exposed  to  different  hazards,  including  tropical \ncyclones, floods, earthquakes, severe storms, and others. The severity, frequency, and location of these \nhazards vary, as do the corresponding socioeconomic impact (Table 1).  \n \n \n\nTable 1: List of Major Hazards in Bangladesh \n\nPotential Severity\n\nRelative Frequency\n\nPeril \n\nFlood \n\nTropical cyclone \n\nEarthquake \n\nSevere storm \n\nExtreme temperature \n\nDrought \n\nFire \n\nBuilding collapse \nLandslide \n\nArsenic contamination \n\nRiverbank erosion \n\nSaltwater intrusion \n\nClimate change \n\n\u2026 = not applicable. \n\nModerate\n\nHigh\n\nHigh\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nLocal\n\nLocal\nLocal\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\nModerate \n\nModerate \n\nModerate \n\nHigh \n\nHigh \n\nLow \n\nHigh \n\nLow \nLow \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\nSource: ADB. 2015.

Manila (TA 8144-BAN). \n \n \n7. \nIn  general,  floods  and  tropical  cyclones  most  adversely  impact  Bangladesh,  based  on  the \nnumber of people affected and the number of people killed. The majority of reported economic loss is \ndue to both floods and tropical cyclones. Severe storms, while very frequent, are typically local events \nand have a smaller effect on Bangladesh as a whole. Although the frequency of damaging earthquakes \nin  Bangladesh  has  been  relatively  low,  the  potential  for  catastrophic  damage  and  destruction  is  very \nhigh (Table 2). \n \n \n\nTable 2: General Hazard Consequence in Bangladesh (%) \n\nPeople Killed\n\nPeople Affected\n\nEstimated Damage\n\nPeril \n\nFlood \n\nTropical cyclone \nSevere storm \nEarthquake \nOthersb \n\n< = less than, \u2026 = not available. \n\n 7\n\n89\n 1\n<1\n 2\n\n75\n\n18\n 1\n<1\n 6\n\n68 \n\n27 \n  5 \n  \u2026a\n\u2026 \n\na  It does not include $500 million damage reported for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. \n\nb  It includes building collapse, drought, extreme temperature, significant fire disasters, landslides, and significant transport or \nindustrial or miscellaneous accidents.

The historical record indicates that an average of about five tropical \ncyclones  with  at  least  tropical  storm  strength  (storms  with  maximum  10-minute  sustained  winds  of \nat least  34  knots)  occur  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  subbasin  every  year,  with  about  one  per  year  passing \ndirectly through Bangladesh boarders. Tropical cyclone activity in Bangladesh is typically higher during \nMay, June, October, and November. The impact of tropical cyclones in Bangladesh can lead to many \nhazards, including but not limited to  high winds, torrential rain,  flooding, storm surge, and landslides. \nCyclones in Bangladesh are typically associated with severe storm surge.  \n \nAccording to the International Disaster Database, 5 of the 10 deadliest tropical cyclones in the \n9. \nworld  since  1900  occurred  in  Bangladesh.1 The  1970  Bhola  cyclone  is  considered  to  be  the  deadliest \never  recorded,  with  estimated  over  500,000  people  killed.  The  1991  Bangladesh  cyclone  caused  an \nestimated  $1.8  billion\u2013$3.0  billion  in  economic  impact  and  over  138,000  deaths.  More  recently, \ntropical cyclone Sidr in 2007 caused significant economic impact, estimated at $1.7 billion\u2013$3.8 billion, \nalthough life loss was less than 5,000 people, illustrating the success of recent advancement in disaster \nrisk management in Bangladesh (e.g., disaster shelters, early warning systems, and timely evacuations). \n \nOverall, available reports indicate that tropical cyclone events in Bangladesh since 1900 have \n10. \nresulted in 0.75 million\u20131.23 million lives lost, 61.6 million people affected, and $4.7 billion\u2013$9.0 billion \nin  damages.  Due  to  data  gaps  in  some  years,  the  actual  historical  impact  is  probably  more  severe. \nThe costliest  tropical  cyclones  on  record  are  tropical  cyclone  Sidr  in  2007  ($3.8  billion  maximum) \nand the  1991  Bangladesh  cyclone  ($3.0  billion  maximum).

While  most  of  the  country  is  flood  prone,  four  general  types  of  flooding  occur:  (i)  flash \nfloods caused by overflowing of hilly rivers in the eastern and northern regions, typically during April to \nMay  and  September  to  November;  (ii)  floods  caused  by  heavy  rains  and  drainage  congestion; \n(iii) monsoon  floods  caused  by  flooding  of  major  rivers,  typically  during  June  to  September;  and \n(iv) coastal floods caused by storm surges. The situation is exacerbated as Bangladesh is a low-lying, \nriverine  country  (about  50%  of  the  country  is  within  7  meters  of  mean  sea  level)  and  most  of  the \ncountry  is  on  a  delta  plain  at  the  confluence  of  the  Ganges  (Padma),  Brahmaputra  (Jamuna),  and \nMeghna rivers. (Uddin Ahmed 2005) \n \n12. \nStatistically, about 20% of the country is affected by floods on average per year, although there \nis  high  distribution  in  interannual  variability  of  flood-affected  areas.  Since  1954,  the  largest  reported \narea affected by flood was 68.0% in 1998, and the smallest reported area was 0.2% in 1994 (Table 4). \nDepending  on  rainfall  variability  within  the  country  and  catchment  flows,  the  location  and  timing  of \nflooding  can  vary  from  one  part  of  the  country  to  another,  although  flooding  risk  is  greatest  on  the \ncoast and around the Ganges\u2013Brahmaputra\u2013Meghna catchment area.  \n \n\nTable 4: Yearly Flood-Affected Area in Bangladesh, 1990\u20132013 \n\nFlood-Affected Area\n\nYear \n1990 \n1991 \n1992 \n1993 \n1994 \n1995 \n1996 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n\nkm2\n    3,500\n 28,600\n   2,000\n  28,742\n         419\n 32,000\n  35,800\n    \n     \u2026\n100,250\n    3,200\n  35,700\n    4,000\n  15,000\n  21,500\n 55,000\n  17,850\n    16,175\n  62,300\n   33,655\n  28,593\n  26,530\n  29,800\n   17,700\n   15,650\n\n%\n 2.4\n19.0\n  1.4\n20.0\n  0.2\n22.0\n24.0\n    \u2026\n68.0\n22.0\n24.0\n 2.8\n10.0\n14.0\n38.0\n12.0\n11.0\n42.0\n23.0\n19.0\n18.0\n20.0\n12.0\n10.6\n\n\u2026 = not available, km2 = square kilometer. \n\nSource: ADB. 2015.

This  has  created  a  feeling  of  false  security \namong  the  public  and  some  decision  makers  to  think  that  earthquake  is  not  a  major  hazard  for \nBangladesh.2 However,  Bangladesh  is  surrounded  by  regions  of  high  seismicity  with  numerous  active \nfaults,  including  the  Dauki  Fault  system.  Inadequate  detailed  design  drawings,  poor  quality  of \nconstruction,  lack  of  proper  supervision,  and  lack  of  enforcement  of  building  codes  and  regulations \nhave  made  areas \nis  a  growing \napprehension that a moderate to severe earthquake in any of the major cities of Bangladesh may result \nin a devastating loss of life and property.  \n \n16. \nTable 7 lists the number of earthquakes (both main shocks and total events) from variety of \nsources, including counts of events within Bangladesh borders (both during the entire reported history \nand  within  the  last  100  years,  i.e.,  1913\u20132013).  The  impact  of  earthquake  in  Bangladesh  can  lead  to \nmany  hazards,  including  ground  shaking,  liquefaction,  fire  following  earthquake,  ground  subsidence, \ntsunamis, seiches, and landslides. Primarily due to its low-lying deltaic geography, the main hazard from \nearthquake in Bangladesh is ground shaking. In general, for many parts of Bangladesh, in particular the \nnorth and east, the seismic hazard is considered to be high.  \n \n17. \nTable  8  presents  the  event-by-event  summary  of  the  consequence  database  of  earthquake \nevents.  The  database  contains  information  for  36  earthquake  events  spanning  from  1548  to  2011. \nIn summary,  earthquake  events  in  Bangladesh  have  reportedly  resulted  in  about  129  lives  lost, \nover 1,850 buildings damaged or destroyed, and over $91 million in damages since 1900.  \n \n \n\nTable 7: Number of Reported Events in the Historical Earthquake Database \n\nTotal Catalog \n\nWithin 50 km of Bangladesh \nBorders (Entire Record) \n\nWithin 50 km of Bangladesh \nBorders (1913\u20132013) \n\nMain shock \n\nMain shock\n\nMain shock \n\nTotal\n\nMagnitude \nMw \n\n4.0\u20134.5 \n\n4.5\u20135.0 \n\n5.0\u20135.5 \n\n5.5\u20136.0 \n6.0\u20136.5 \n6.5\u20137.0 \n7.0\u20137.5 \n7.5\u20138.0 \n\n(cid:149)8.0 \nTotal \n\n  284 \n\n  320 \n\n  295 \n\n    149 \n     58 \n     30 \n      19 \n      7 \n\n       9 \n\n1,171 \n\nTotal \n\n2,566 \n\n 1,438 \n\n   680 \n\n    282 \n      131 \n      45 \n       22 \n         8 \n\n         9 \n\n5,181 \n\n 38\n\n 38\n\n 36\n\n  21\n  17\n   3\n    5\n    2\n\n    1\n\n161\n\nTotal\n\n206\n\n106\n\n 55\n\n 30\n 20\n   3\n    5\n    2\n\n    1\n\n428\n\n  32 \n\n  35 \n\n  29 \n\n   15 \n    9 \n    1 \n    2 \n    0 \n\n    0 \n\n123 \n\n198\n\n101\n\n 44\n\n 23\n  9\n  1\n   2\n   0\n\n   0\n\n378\n\nkm = kilometer, Mw = moment magnitude. \n\nSource: ADB. 2015.

Manila (TA 8144-BAN). \n \n \nE. \n \n18. \nIn  addition  to  weather-related  hazards  such  as  tropical  cyclones  and  floods,  Bangladesh  is \nfrequently exposed to severe storms, which are typically local thunderstorms known as kal-baishakhi. \nThey occur from late February to early June, and the frequency of severe kal-baishakhi usually reaches \na maximum in April. Kal-baishakhi are generally associated with squalls (strong winds), torrential rain, \ntornadoes,  hail,  and  lightning.  Overall,  the  frequency  of  severe  storms  in  Bangladesh  is  high,  with  an \naverage of over 150 events estimated per year. The majority  of severe storms have been reported in \ncentral Bangladesh, although occurrence is generally well distributed throughout the country. \n \n19. \nSince  1951,  at  least  20  severe  storm  events  in  Bangladesh  have  resulted  in  100  or  more \nreported lives lost. Of these, three events have reportedly caused 1,000 or more lives lost, including the \ntornadoes in 1964, 1973, and 1989. The destructive Daulatpur\u2013Saturia tornado in 1989 that occurred in \nthe Manikganj District on 26 April is considered one of the deadliest tornadoes in Bangladesh\u2019s history \nwith  around  1,300  lives  lost.  The  most  severe  event  in  terms  of  people  affected  was  thunderstorms \nwith  hailstorm  and  rain  on  7\u20138  January  1993  in  the  northern  region  of  Bangladesh,  which  affected \n750,000  people.  Most  events  are  very  localized  and  thus  affect  smaller  population  size  relative  to \ntropical  cyclones  and  floods.  The  most  severe  event  in  terms  of  reported  economic  damage  is  a \ntornado  that  struck  Madaripur  and  Faridpur  on  1  April  1977,  with  a  reported  estimated  damage  of \n$50 million. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(cid:3)\n\n\f \n\nDisaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh \n\n9 \n\nHistoric Economic Impact of Major Disasters Since 2000 \n\nF. \n \n20. \nIn total, significant sudden-onset natural hazard events in Bangladesh during 2000\u20132013 are \nestimated to have affected 99.7 million people, resulted in 8,351 lives lost, and caused $10.8 billion in \neconomic impact with damages and losses to all sectors (Table 9). In terms of economic impact and \npeople  affected,  floods  contribute  to  the  majority  of  the  consequence\u2014about  66%  of  economic \nimpact  and  83%  of  people  affected.  The  majority  of  life  loss  (63%)  is  due  to  tropical  cyclones. \nAlthough the impact of severe storms is less than that of tropical cyclones and floods, severe storms \noccur  frequently  and  have  contributed  to  about  12%  of  the  total  life  loss.  No  major  earthquake \nhappened during this period. \n \n \n\nTable 9: Estimated Disaster Consequence in Bangladesh, 2000\u20132013 \n\nFlood \n\nTropical Cyclone\n\nEarthquake\n\nSevere Storm\n\nTotal\n\n \n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n$\n(\n \nt\nc\na\np\nm\n\nI\n \nc\ni\nm\no\nn\no\nc\nE\n\n2 \n\n\u2026 \n\n1 \n\n62 \n\n46 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n \n\ns\ns\no\nL\ne\nf\ni\nL\n\n \n\n37 \n\n19 \n\n26 \n\n104 \n\n765 \n\n60 \n\n105 \n\n \n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n$\n(\n \nt\nc\na\np\nm\n\nI\n \nc\ni\nm\no\nn\no\nc\nE\n\n500 \n\n70 \n\n1,015 \n\n970 \n\n122 \n\n21 \n\n126 \n\n50 \n\n124 \n\n185 \n\n573 \n\n42 \n\n \nr\na\ne\nY\n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n \n\nd\ne\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\n\n \n\nl\n\nA\ne\np\no\ne\nP\n\n3,244,576 \n\n700,000 \n\n7,608,837 \n\n7,874,465 \n\n1,220,000 \n\n211,775 \n\n975,096 \n\n500,000 \n\n1,240,000 \n\n1,853,000 \n\n5,398,475 \n\n2004 \n\n2,280 \n\n40,955,375 \n\n\u2026 = not available. \n\n1,067 \n\n10,655,564 \n\n594  1,676 \n\n9,003,259 4,410\n\n28 \n\n17 \n\n321,839\n\n16 \n\n1,156 \n\n4,919,188\n\n119 \n\n53 \n\n139 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n26 \n\n133,688\n\n415,250 \n\n\u2026 \n\n 276 \n\n1,328,237\n\n \n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n$\n(\n \nt\nc\na\np\nm\n\nI\n \nc\ni\nm\no\nn\no\nc\nE\n\n 1\n\n 1\n\n 1\n\n 5\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n 1\n\n 1\n\n 2\n\n\u2026\n\n 1\n\n 1\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n \n\nd\ne\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\n\n \n\nl\n\nA\ne\np\no\ne\nP\n\n15,000\n\n5,000\n\n312,817\n\n116,269\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n \n\ns\ns\no\nL\ne\nf\ni\nL\n\n \n\n253\n\n\u2026\n\n182\n\n11\n\n89\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n13\n\n195\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n108\n\n17\n\n \n\nd\ne\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\n\n \n\nl\n\nA\ne\np\no\ne\nP\n\n500\n\n500\n\n500\n\n2,500\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n500\n\n250\n\n1,000\n\n\u2026\n\n500\n\n250\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n \n\ns\ns\no\nL\ne\nf\ni\nL\n\n \n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n5\n\n \n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n$\n(\n \nt\nc\na\np\nm\n\nI\n \nc\ni\nm\no\nn\no\nc\nE\n\n 78\n\n 14\n\n 56\n\n   5\n\n   9\n\n 17\n\n   5\n\n \u2026\n\n   0\n\n \u2026\n\n129\n\n   0\n\n 28\n\n 33\n\n \n\nd\ne\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\n\n \n\nl\n\nA\ne\np\no\ne\nP\n\n111,400\n\n10,420\n\n33,606\n\n9,014\n\n200\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n257,160\n\n121\n\n55,121\n\n33,563\n\n \n\ns\ns\no\nL\ne\nf\ni\nL\n\n \n\n73 \n\n60 \n\n161 \n\n39 \n\n\u2026 \n\n12 \n\n\u2026 \n\n26 \n\n13 \n\n25 \n\n33 \n\n \n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n$\n(\n \nt\nc\na\np\nm\n\nI\n \nc\ni\nm\no\nn\no\nc\nE\n\n \n\nd\ne\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\n\n \n\nl\n\nA\ne\np\no\ne\nP\n\n \n\ns\ns\no\nL\ne\nf\ni\nL\n\n \n\n374\n\n257\n\n281\n\n178\n\n221\n\n144\n\n53\n\n211\n\n145\n\n66\n\n272\n\n50\n\n139 \n\n27 \n\n1,253,606\n\n221,289\n\n2,744 \n\n19,659,073 5,004\n\n145 \n\n1,298,135\n\n1,206 \n\n5,419,188\n\n254 \n\n186 \n\n627 \n\n351 \n\n1,497,660\n\n1,853,371\n\n5,587,284\n\n1,777,050\n\n156,399\n\n84 \n\n28,750\n\n238 \n\n581 \n\n85 \n\n3,416,475\n\n729,250\n\n1,073 \n\n7,725,737\n\n1,042 \n\n8,200,202\n\n18,200\n\n239 \n\n2,335 \n\n41,089,844\n\n1,095\n\nTotal \n\n7,145 \n\n82,852,413       2,065  3,262 \n\n16,155,297 5,278\n\n14\n\n6,500\n\n374\n\n713,954 1,003 \n\n10,795  99,728,164 8,351\n\nSource: ADB. 2015.

These  years  were  characterized  by  catastrophic  floods  in  2004  and  tropical \ncyclone  Sidr  in  2007.  In  terms  of  major  disasters,  2006  was  the  least  significant  with  less  than \n$30 million  in  damages  and  about  220,000  people  affected.  Major  disasters  in  Bangladesh  during \n2000\u20132013 have resulted in about $771 million in losses, 7.1 million people affected, and 600 lives lost \non average per year. \n \n \n\n\fADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n\n10 \n \n\nIII.      TROPICAL CYCLONE AND FLOOD RISK MODEL  \n\nOF BANGLADESH \n\n \nTo  estimate  the  financial  impact  of  disasters,  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  developed  risk \n22. \nmodels  of  tropical  cyclones  and  floods  in  Bangladesh.  The  risk  models  in  Table  10  and  Figure  2 \nestimate  the  financial  impact  due  to  damage  and  loss  for  all  sectors  in  Bangladesh.  The  flood  losses \nwere inferred from an analysis of historical flood data. The tropical cyclone losses are derived from the \ndetailed probabilistic AIR tropical cyclone risk model.4 \n \n23. \nAs shown in Table 10 and Figure 2, Bangladesh is expected to incur a financial impact of about \n$3.2  billion  on  average  per  year  due  to  cyclone  and  flood,  or  about  2.2%  of  the  2014  GDP. \nFurthermore,  there  is  a  1%  chance  that  the  financial  impact  from  cyclones  will  exceed  $7.2  billion  in \nany year, and a 1% chance that the financial impact from floods will exceed $12.4 billion in any year. It is \nexpected  that  the  financial  risk  from  other  perils  such  as  severe  storm  and  earthquake  is  much  less \nsevere than that of cyclone and flood. \n \n24. \nBased on the estimated risk profile, the flooding in 2004 represents a 10-year event (i.e., the \nlevel of loss incurred by the 2004 floods is expected to be exceeded on average once every 10 years). \nThe 2007 tropical cyclone Sidr is expected to be a 20-year event, 2009 cyclone Aila a 5-year event, \nand 2013 cyclone Mahasen a 2-year event. The 1991 cyclone and 1998 floods are expected to be each \ngreater than a 100-year event. \n \n \n\nTable 10: Qualitative Tropical Cyclone and Flood Risk Model of Bangladesh \n\nMRP (year) \n    2 \n\n \n\n    5 \n\n  10 \n\n  20 \n\n  50 \n\n100 \n\n500 \n\n \n\nEconomic Impact \n\nCyclone \n\nFlood  \n\n($ million)\n\n(% GDP)\n\n($ million) \n\n(% GDP)\n\n    403\n\n 1,617\n\n2,727\n\n3,907\n\n5,752\n\n7,209\n\n10,958\n\n    994\n\n0.3\n\n1.1\n\n1.9\n\n2.7\n\n3.9\n\n4.9\n\n7.4\n\n0.7\n\n 1,002 \n\n 3,861 \n\n 5,864 \n\n 7,574 \n\n10,152 \n\n12,436 \n\n15,295 \n\n 2,210 \n\n 0.7\n\n 2.6\n\n 4.0\n\n 5.1\n\n 6.9\n\n 8.4\n\n10.4\n\n 1.5\n\nAverage annual loss \n\nEP = exceedance probability, GDP = gross domestic product, MRP = mean return period. \n\nSource: ADB. 2015.

Probabilistic risk models provide information on the risk of natural hazards, since \nthey quantify the likelihood of future catastrophe events and consequences by computing loss potentials that go beyond \nthe  available  historical  record.  Information  derived  from  catastrophe  risk  models  can  also  overcome  the  limitations  \nand  data  gaps  of  reported  observations  of  past  events.  The  AIR  tropical  cyclone  model  for  Bangladesh  captures  the \neffects  of  tropical  cyclone-induced  winds  and  flooding  from  tropical  cyclone-induced  precipitation  on  properties  in \nBangladesh.  It  is  a  stochastic,  event-based  model  designed  for  portfolio  risk  assessment.  Details  of  the  AIR  tropical \ncyclone  model  are  in  ADB.  2015.

Methodology \n \n25. \nOne of the TA\u2019s key questions is whether losses and damages from disasters were adequately \nfunded,  and  if  so,  from  what  sources.  To  answer  the  question,  the  TA  conducted  a  funding  gap \nanalysis.  A  funding  gap  is  defined  as  the  residual  between  total  annual  losses  incurred  as  a \nconsequence  of  disasters  and  funding  available  to  meet  those  losses.  Full  identification  of  the \nresources allocated to disaster risk is assessed, which can be shown to encourage the government and \nprivate  sector  that  greater  investment  in  risk  reduction  in  general  and  ex  ante  disaster  finance \ninstruments in particular is economically rational. \n \n26. \nThe  funding  gap  analysis  presented  here  relies  on  the  data  related  to  the  catastrophes  in \nBangladesh  from  2000  to  2013.  The  damage  information  relates  to  reported  monetary  damages \ncaused  by  four  different  types  of  perils\u2014tropical  cyclones,  earthquakes,  storms,  and  floods.  The \ndamage  data  represent  the  total  economic  loss  sustained  by  all  sectors;  the  resulting  funding  gap \nillustrates total gap borne by both private and public sectors.5 \n \n27. \nThe  funding  information  is  comprised  of  three  components  of  funding  for  (i)  recovery  and \nrehabilitation  projects,  (ii)  humanitarian  aid,  and  (iii)  foreign  aid  on  disaster-related  emergency \nresponse. \n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n5  There  was  no  reliable  data  available  to  provide  a  clear  distinction  of  responsibility  between  public  and  private  losses. \nBased  on  some  experts  polled  in  this  report,  the  public  sector  damage  is,  in  general,  approximated  at  85%  of  the  total \ndamage and could potentially be used to infer the portion of the government\u2019s catastrophe responsibility. \n\n\fADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n\nFunding for Recovery and Rehabilitation Projects \n\nThe projects for recovery, rehabilitation, and prevention cover a variety of areas including \n\n(cid:882)(cid:3) maintenance,  rehabilitation,  and  restoration  of  flood-affected  educational  building  (e.g., \n\nprimary, secondary, higher secondary schools) and other urban infrastructure; \n\n(cid:882)(cid:3) house construction for flood-affected landless people; \nrecovery and restoration projects for agricultural crops; and \n(cid:882)(cid:3)\n(cid:882)(cid:3) other emergency cyclone recovery and rehabilitation projects.6 \n\n \n29. \nThe total procurement cost of those 55 projects during 2000\u20132013 is $897 million. Of those, \n29 are supported by international donors and aid agencies.

Figure 5 portrays the annual foreign aid on disaster-related emergency response \nfor Bangladesh for 2002 and 2013. It is evident that emergency-related foreign aid is significant only in \nmajor  disaster  years.  The  2007  tropical  cyclone  Sidr  witnessed  more  than  $600  million  worth  of \nforeign aid mainly for rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance, and several supplemental financing \nfor floods and municipal services. Turning to the other years, 2004 saw $209 million in disaster-related \nforeign  aid,  while  2008  had  $186  million  and  2009  had  $52  million.

The \nforeign aid figures on disaster-related emergency support for 2000, 2001, and 2013 were not available; \nhowever,  the  unavailability  of  data  for  these  years  is  unlikely  to  make  a  difference  to  the  key \nconclusions given that there were no major disasters in those years. \n \nE. \n \n35. \nTable  11  summarizes  the  disaster-related  economic  loses,  available  funding,  and  disparity \nbetween the two. It consists of total annual economic costs (loss and damage) for flood, severe storm, \nearthquake,  and  tropical  cyclone.  The  table  documents  the  funding  amounts  for  recovery  and \nrehabilitation  projects,  the  humanitarian  aid  into  Bangladesh,  and  foreign  aid  on  disaster-related \nemergency  response.  The  sum  of  these  three  funding  components  makes  up  the  total  funding \navailable  to  Bangladesh  in  the  case  of  catastrophes.  Finally,  the  disparity  between  total  damage  and \ntotal funding constitutes the funding gap. \n \n36. \nFigure  6  presents  the  sum  of  funding  amounts  for  recovery  and  rehabilitation  projects, \nhumanitarian aid, and foreign aid on disaster-related emergency response. The total funding for over \n14 years from 2000 to 2013 is $2.7 billion.  \n \n37. \nFigure  7  documents  the  funding  gap  of  $8.1  billion  in  Bangladesh  during  2000\u20132013. \nConcomitant with the sizeable economic impacts, the funding gap was $2 billion in 2004, $1.7 billion \nin 2007,  and  $1  billion  in  2009.  Even  2000  and  2012  experienced  sizeable  funding  gaps  of  slightly \nmore than  $500  million  each.  The  funding  gap  was  close  to  zero  in  2001,  2005,  and  2011,  and  even \nnegative in 2006 and 2008 as Bangladesh experienced an average funding surplus of $119 million.  \n \n \n \n \n\n(cid:3)\n\n\fDisaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh \n\n15 \n\nTable 11: Disaster-Related Economic Impact and Funding Gap in Bangladesh, 2000\u20132013 \n($ million) \n\nDisaster-\nRelated \nEconomic \nImpact \n\nFunding for \nRecovery and \nRehabilitation \nProjects \n\nDisaster-Related Funding\n\nForeign Aid on \nDisaster-Related \nEmergency \nResponse \n\nHumanitarian \nAid \n\nTotal \nFunding \n\nFunding \nGap \n\nYear \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \nTotal \n\n582 \n\n85 \n\n1,072 \n\n1,042 \n\n2,335 \n\n139 \n\n27 \n\n2,744 \n145 \n\n1,206 \n\n254 \n\n186 \n\n626 \n\n350 \n10,793 \n\n61 \n\n67 \n\n129 \n\n8 \n\n60 \n\n95 \n\n58 \n\n73 \n111 \n\n38 \n\n52 \n\n64 \n\n47 \n\n34 \n897 \n\n5\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n109\n\n6\n\n12\n\n300\n43\n\n37\n\n31\n\n66\n\n32\n\n26\n679\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n209\n\n645\n186\n\n52\n\n0.2\n\n\u2026\n1,093\n\n66 \n\n69 \n\n135 \n\n11 \n\n378 \n\n101 \n\n71 \n\n1,018 \n339 \n\n128 \n\n84 \n\n131 \n\n79 \n\n60 \n2,670 \n\n516\n\n16\n\n937\n\n1,030\n\n1,957\n\n38\n\n(44)\n\n1,726\n(194)\n\n1,078\n\n170\n\n55\n\n547\n\n290\n8,122\n\n(  ) = negative, \u2026 = not available. \n\nSource: ADB. 2015.

Although the country runs small funding deficits \nor  surpluses  in  the  years  without  major  disasters,  the  long-run  funding  gap  is  very  substantial, \namounting  to  more  than  $8  billion  during  2000\u20132013  (Figure  7).  This  funding  deficit  arose  because \nonly around a quarter of the $10.8 billion total disaster-related damage is covered by the total available \nfunding in the said period. Of the $2.7 billion total available funding that has been reliably identified, \n$897 million came from recovery and rehabilitation projects, $679 million from humanitarian aid, and \n$1,093 million from foreign aid on disaster-related emergency response. Only 13% of the total available \nfunding was generated internally. It is estimated that there may have been additional expenditure that \nwas  not  identified  due  to  data  gaps.  Thus,  the  total  disaster-related  expenditure  could  have  been \nhigher. \n \n \n\nFigure 7: Funding Gap of Catastrophes in Bangladesh, 2000\u20132013 \n($ million) \n\n \n\np\na\nG\ng\nn\nd\nn\nu\nF\n\ni\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n\u2013500\n\n2000\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n\n2008\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n\n \nSource: ADB. 2015.

Government \n \n39. \nThe  Finance  Division  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  the  core  body  that  allocates  the  domestic \ndisaster-related  funding  across  different  governmental  and  nongovernmental  layers. 9 Budgetary \nmatters  including  allocations  are  outlined  in  the  annual  budget  document  at  the  beginning  of  each \nfinancial  year.  In  particular,  the  Finance  Division  allocates  the  required  budget  to  each  line  ministry, \nwhich adds up to the central government budget.  \n \n\n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n9  Disaster risk financing in this section refers to both ex ante and ex post financing instruments for disasters. \n\n \n \n\n(cid:3)\n\n\f \n\nDisaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh \n\n17 \n\nThe  budgetary  system  in  Bangladesh  involves  several  small  pockets  of  money  dedicated  to \n\n40. \ndisaster management. Some of the identified pockets are as follows: \n \n\n(i)(cid:3) Disaster  Risk  Reduction  Fund.  It  is  dedicated  specifically  for  disaster  risk  reduction. \n\nThe amount available could not be identified but is likely to be modest. \n\n(ii)(cid:3) Emergency Fund Disaster Management. It is allocated to Deputy Commissioner at the \n\ndistrict level. The amount is confirmed to be small. \n\n(iii)(cid:3) Fund  for  Unforeseen  Incidents. It is available each year amounting to one billion taka \n(approximately  $14.28  million).  This  funding  can  be  allocated  for  any  purpose  in  an \nordinary year. \n\n(iv)(cid:3) Palli  Karma-Sahayak  Foundation.  It  is  a  microfinance  wholesaler  and  implements \nClimate Resilience Fund under the Ministry of Finance. Headed by the Ministry, a high-\nlevel  committee  decides  on  the  distribution  of  funds  to  participating  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs).  \n\nBangladesh Bank (Central Bank) \n\n \n41.  When  there  is  a  domestic  funding  gap  following  catastrophes,  typically  the  foreign  financing \nmechanism is initiated. The Economic Relations Division of the Ministry of Finance mobilizes foreign \nfinancing through multilateral and bilateral development partners. The process works in a way in which \nline  ministries  approach  the  Economic  Relations  Division  for  emergency  financing,  which  then \nactivates bilateral links to meet the requirements. The coverage of foreign aid includes infrastructure \nprojects;  procurement  of  food;  social,  sanitation,  healthcare,  and  education  support  projects;  and \ncyclone shelters program.  \n \nB. \n \n42. \nThe  role  of  Bangladesh  Bank  in  disaster  risk  management  is  related  to  its  environmental  and \nsocially responsible central banking approach. It issued Green Banking Policy covering Green Finance, \nClimate Risk Fund, In-house Environmental Management, and Green Banking Policy at strategic level \nof  banks  and  financial  institutions.  Bangladesh  Bank  issued  Environmental  Risk  Management \nGuidelines to banks and financial institutions to assess environmental risk in their credit portfolio.  \n \n43. \nAs a pioneering initiative, Bangladesh  Bank created a separate fund named Bangladesh  Bank \nDisaster  Management  and  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Fund  in  2013.  This  fund  is  utilized  for \ncapacity  building  in  different  disaster  risk  management  and  socially  responsible  projects.  Under  this \nfund,  it  is  envisaged  that  each  of  the  88  institutions  deposit  Tk50  million,  potentially  adding  to \nTk4.5 billion  (approximately  $64.3  million),  that  could  be  made  available  for  postdisaster  response, \ndisaster risk management, and capacity building. \n \nC. \n \n44. \nBangladesh insurance market is dominated by two state-owned corporations\u2014Sadharan Bima \nCorporation for general insurance and Jiban Bima Corporation for life insurance. A total of 31 private \nlife and 46 private general insurance companies also operate in this market, and 12 life insurers and 2 \ngeneral insurers offer microinsurance. The microinsurance products offered by the general insurance \ncompanies are health and flood insurance.  \n \n \n\nInsurance Sector \n\n\fADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n\n18 \n \n\nCurrently,  a  vast  majority  of  the  population,  especially  in  rural  areas,  is  left  outside  the \n45. \ninsurance  coverage  in  Bangladesh  due  to  lack  of  awareness.  However,  there  have  been  recent \ndevelopments  to  improve  access  among  poor  and  vulnerable  communities  to  financing  tools  that \npromote  resilience  and  reduce  (O\u2019Donnell  2009)  economic  losses  due  to  disasters.  Several  leading \nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs),  including  Grameen  Bank  and  Proshika,  have  implemented  small-\nscale  livestock  microinsurance  programs  to  protect  their  investment  loans  for  dairy  cattle  and \nwater buffalo  livestock  producers.  Typically  the  insurance  provides  all  risk  mortality  cover  during  the  \n2\u20133-year  loan  repayment  period,  and  the  sum  insured  is  fixed  in  accordance  with  the  loan  amount. \nThe MFIs  operate  their  own  internal  livestock  indemnity  funds  without  any  form  of  catastrophe \nreinsurance protection (FAO 2011). \n \nThere  is  a  \u201cmeso-level\u201d  index-based  flood  insurance  being  piloted  in  Sirajganj  area  by  Swiss \n46. \nAgency  for  Development  and  Cooperation,  Oxfam,  Pragati  General  Insurance,  Palli  Karma-Sahayak \nFoundation (PKSF), Manab Mukti Sangstha and Swiss Re. The insurance coverage is for the peak flood \nperiod (16 August\u201330 September), and maximum payout is Tk8,000. There are four levels of payout \ndepending on the flood water level and the number of days the water level remains high. The project \nwas  launched  in  2013  and  covers  1,661  households.  The  premium  is  paid  by  the  Swiss  Agency  for \nDevelopment and Cooperation. The insurers have made a payout in 2014, but details are not available. \nA few other index-based products are being piloted by international donors. \n \nD.  Microfinance Sector \n \n47. \nMFIs can potentially play significant roles in disaster risk management. MFIs offer a number of \nservices,  which  can  help  clients  in  coping  with  the  impact  of  catastrophes.  The  services  include \nprovision of temporary loans, loan forgiveness, rescheduling of loan, asset replacement, housing loans, \nand loans for starting new activities.  \n \n48. \nCurrently,  there  are  742  registered  MFIs  with  the  Microcredit  Regulatory  Authority.  MFIs \nhave over  26.4  million  members  and  19.7  million  borrowers.  As  of  May  2014,  loans  amounted  to \nTk257.01  billion  (approximately  $3.3  billion)  and  savings  amounted  to  Tk94  billion  (approximately \n$1.2 billion).  The  total  number  of  cooperatives  was  164,536  with  over  8.6  million  members  and \ndeposits in excess of Tk29.4 billion (approximately $378.3 million). \n \n49. \nDisasters can have a profound impact on microcredit operations. For example, during the 1998 \nfloods,  1.2  million  members  of  Grameen  Bank  were  affected,  of  which  0.8  million  were  seriously \naffected.  Activities  funded  through  loans  were  destroyed,  and  Grameen  Bank  faced  severe  liquidity \nissue  and  had  to  take  Tk1  billion  (approximately  $12.9  million)  loan  from  Bangladesh  Bank  to  cope \nwith the  events.  Grameen  Bank  members  who  received  housing  loan  before  were  given  Tk5,000 \n(approximately  $64.4)  again  if  their  houses  suffered  damages.  Those  members  who  did  not  receive \nhousing loans before were given Tk2,500 (approximately $32.20).  \n \nBRAC, a microfinance NGO, has made specific arrangements for flood disasters: (i) clients can \n50. \nwithdraw  savings  up  to  a  specific  pre-established  amount;  (ii)  regular  loan  repayments  can  be \nsuspended;  (iii)  interest  rates  can  be  reduced  for  up  to  2  months;  (iv)  loans  can  be  restructured  for \nclients  with  marginal  disaster  losses;  (v)  loans  can  be  refinanced  for  clients  with  high  disaster  losses; \n(vi)  new  loans  are  offered  for  productive  asset  replacement  of  up  to  12  months  at  15%  interest;  and \n(vii)  an  option  of  disbursement  in  the  form  of  seeds,  animals,  and  other  in-kind  materials  is  also \navailable. After the 1998 floods, BRAC extended loans to 240,000 families for repairing and rebuilding \nhomes.  \n\n(cid:3)\n\n\f \n\nDisaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh \n\n19 \n\nPKSF has seven microinsurance programs including credit life, livestock, hospital cash plan, and \n51. \nparametric  healthcare.  PKSF  has  established  a  Covariant  Risk  Fund  to  protect  partner  organizations \nthat do not have any insurance or reinsurance coverage. PKSF has also set up a Disaster Management \nProgram under which it waives the entire outstanding loan amount if the income-earning person in the \nhousehold is killed due to a disaster. This is an important risk management approach because PKSF\u2019s \nmicrocredit programs have a total outreach of 35 million people. To help them cope with and recover \nfrom  disasters,  PKSF  has  created  a  fund  called  SAHOS  (\"courage\u201d  in  Bangla)  under  its  Disaster \nManagement  Program  to  provide  quick  financial  assistance  to  the  poor  families.  SAHOS  provides \nemergency  medical  services,  water,  and  sanitation.  As  of  June  2014,  149  partner  organizations \nparticipated in this program, and they disbursed Tk5.0 billion (approximately $63 million) to 120,698 \nborrowers. Most of the loans were made during tropical cyclone Sidr (2007) and cyclone Aila (2009). \n \n52. \nBURO  Tangail,  an  NGO,  has  a  contingency  fund  for  major  disaster  events  or  other \nemergencies. For example, if a borrower dies or becomes permanently incapacitated, the fund can be \nused to write off the outstanding debt. Also, the fund can be used to provide supplemental loans to \nborrowers  when  their  productive  assets  are  damaged  or  stolen.  Finally,  when  a  loan  is  more  than \n6 months overdue, the reserve fund can be applied to the balance. \n \n \n\nVI.      DISASTER RISK FINANCE OPTIONS FOR BANGLADESH \n\n \nA.

The 100-year loss (a loss \nexpected to happen once every 100 years) for flood is equivalent to 8%\u20139% of GDP, and for tropical \ncyclone around 5% of GDP. Given the low penetration rate of individual and business insurance and \nthe lack of alternative financial coping mechanisms for catastrophes, the sovereign responsibility and \nthe amount of risk which needs to be financed by the state are large. \n \n54.  With Figure 7 in the previous section, one can differentiate various levels of need and suitable \nfinancing  mechanisms.  In  Figure  8,  the  lower  area  covers  the  funding  gap  which  is  best  managed \nthrough  internal  budgetary  and  reserve  mechanisms.  In  some  years,  a  more  significant  funding  gap \noccurs  (i.e.,  greater  than  $250  million),  requiring  an  alternative  risk  financing  mechanism  such  as \ncontingent credit (middle part). Then finally once every 5\u201310 years or more, major disaster events will \nrequire some sort of risk transfer mechanism as the quantum of losses will be too large to be financed \nthrough reserve or contingent credit mechanisms. Such risk transfer can be in both public and private \nsectors. \n \nB. \n \n55. \nBuilding  on  the  analysis  above,  Figure  9  shows  the  relative  contribution  of  government  and \nnongovernment  sectors  to  the  1-in-100-year  cyclone  loss  estimate  from  the  cyclone  model. \nGovernment losses are further split into emergency (i.e., immediate), medium term (up to 6 months), \nand long-term. The 6-month time frame is generally taken as the transition from recovery to long-term \nrebuilding  phases,  and  coincides  with  the  minimum  time  generally  taken  to  mobilize  rebuilding \nfinancing from the international development financing institutions. NGO and MFI damage and loss is \naddressed predominantly in medium-term response while the private sector covers both medium and \nlong-term response.  \n\nBreaking Down the Funding Gap \n\n\fADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n\n20 \n \n\nFigure 8: Funding Gap Results Summary with Risk Financing Options \n($ million) \n\n2000\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n\n2008\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n\n \nSource: ADB. 2015.

Manila (TA 8144-BAN). \n\nAs  shown  in  Figure  9,  around  50%  of  the  financing  is  required  for  long-term  rebuilding,  and \n\n \n \n56. \naround 30%\u201335% for medium-term recovery investment. \n \n57. \nTaking this analysis a step further, the project estimated the relative portion of the funding gap \nof the five categories identified above. Figure 10 provides the relative breakdown of the total funding \ngap for a 1-in-100-year cyclone event, assuming that the funding gap is 50% of the total modeled loss. \n \n58. \nThis  analysis  suggests  that  the  funding  gap  is  predominantly  focused  on  the  medium-term \nsovereign needs and the needs of the NGO and MFI sector, which are also in the medium term. This \nsuggests that risk financing solution for the government and NGO and MFI sector in the 1\u20136 months \npostdisaster period are most appropriate. \n \nC. \n \n\nPractical Implementable Solutions \n\n1. \n\nSovereign Options \n\n \n59. \nTwo sovereign disaster risk financing options are most practical for the short to medium term \nin Bangladesh\u2014contingent credit and parametric risk transfer for cyclone or flood. Contingent credit \nwould  be  deployed  to  complement  internal  budgetary  mechanisms  for  response  to  more  frequent \nevents,  while  parametric  risk  transfer  would  deal  with  less  frequent  events  (i.e.,  1  in  10  annualized \nprobability and less frequent) and could provide rapid liquidity to support early recovery. \n \n \n \n \n\n\fADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n\n22 \n \n\na. \n\nContingent Credit \n\n \n60. \nA  contingent  credit  line  on  pre-agreed  terms,  which  can  be  made  rapidly  available  using  a \ntrigger,  could  provide  a  useful  complement  to  emergency  response  funds  set  aside  as  budget \ncontingencies  at  the  national  level.  It  will  also  reduce  the  uncertainty  associated  with  international \ndonor-driven emergency response mechanisms. For better risk management, a contingent credit line \ncan  be  combined  with  capacity  building  in  disaster  preparedness  and  early  warning,  including \ndevelopment of pre-agreed contingency and recovery plans. \n \n61. \n \n\nThe key likely elements of a contingent credit line are the following: \n\n(i)(cid:3)\n\nStand-alone or contingent extension. The credit line is structured as a stand-alone or \ncontingent extension of a normal funding window, likely a loan for investment in disaster \nrisk management. \n\n(ii)(cid:3) Pre-agreed  trigger.  An  example  of  this  trigger  is  a  declaration  of  emergency  by  the \n\nnational government. \n\n(iii)(cid:3) Cap  on  contingent  credit  amount.  A  $250  million  credit  facility  would  approximately \nmatch the Government of Bangladesh\u2019s capacity in the form of reserve funds and budget \nreallocations,  and  these  together  could  cover  around  half  of  the  funding  gap  for \nmedium-term  recovery  for  a  1-in-100-year  tropical  cyclone  disaster  (Figure  8).  Partial \ndrawdown would be allowable. \n\nb. \n\nParametric Sovereign Risk Transfer \n\n \n62. \nA risk transfer product would be appropriate for relatively infrequent but large-impact events. \nThe TA developed an example in which the insurance policy trigger is set at the 1-in-10-year loss level \n(for each of the covered perils separately), and payout will increase pro-rate basis until the coverage \nlimit reaches to the paid out level for a 1-in-100-year event. This is a typical structure for a sovereign \nparametric product, maximizing the relative cost-effectiveness of risk transfer but also allowing for a \npayout probability acceptable at the political level. \n \n63. \nFor  simplicity,  the  two  perils,  flood  and  cyclone,  are  treated  as  independent  perils  and  have \nstand-alone  policies  and  stand-alone  pricing.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  while  flood  cover  is \naddressed here based on the risk profile presented above, there is currently no sovereign parametric \nflood model in existence anywhere in the world, and it will take several years before one is developed \nand accepted by the markets. \n \n64. \nGiven  the  stated  target  for  a  sovereign  risk  transfer  product,  the  full  national  loss  profile  has \nbeen  downscaled  to  25%  of  the  total  losses,  which  approximates  the  portion  of  losses  requiring \nfinancing  during  the  medium-term  recovery  phase  (Figure  9).  Figure  11  shows  the  full  exceedance \nprobability curves for flood and cyclone used as a basis for structuring the risk transfer product. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n(cid:3)\n\n\fDisaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh \n\n23 \n\nFigure 11: Exceedance Probability Curves for Government Response Costs  \nRepresenting 25% of the Full Modeled National Loss \n\n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n$\n(\n \ns\ns\no\nL\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\nG\nd\ne\nt\na\nm\n\n \n\ni\nt\ns\nE\n\n4,500\n\n4,000\n\n3,500\n\n3,000\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n \n65. \n \n \n\nCyclone\n\nFlood\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n \nSource: ADB. 2015.

Doubling  premium  will  double  not  only  the \ncoverage limit but also the payout for any event which triggers the policy (i.e., losses greater than the \nattachment point).  \n \n67. \nActual pricing of a product will depend on a variety of structuring and market factors which can \nbe  better  determined  only  once  a  product  is  developed  and  placement  is  considered.  However,  the \npricing  range  utilized  above  is  felt  to  be  reasonably  stable\u2014certainly  in  the  coming  few  years\u2014and \n\n\fADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n\n24 \n \n\nthere is high confidence of global market appetite for sovereign risk from countries such as Bangladesh, \nassuming  that  the  underlying  parametric  model  is  well-understood  and  accepted  and  the  product  is \nstructured appropriately. \n \n\n2.  Nonsovereign Options \n\n \n68. \nHelping the population to help themselves is a highly efficient way of reducing the burden on \nthe government when disaster strikes. Traditional property, and catastrophe and agricultural insurance \nmarkets  are  not  well  developed  in  Bangladesh  and  appear  unlikely  to  scale  up  quickly.  However,  the \nrelatively strong microfinance sector means that microinsurance, particularly weather index insurance, \nis likely to be the most appropriate tools for expanding markets in Bangladesh. \n \n69. \nBuilding  on  the  microfinance  platform,  index-based  weather  products  at  the  individual  and \nespecially  at  the  portfolio  level  should  be  primary  targets  for  support.  While  piloting  and  eventual \nexpansion  of  individual  microinsurance  products  such  as  Oxfam\u2019s  index-based  flood  insurance \nprogram  are  worthy  of  support,  experience  from  around  the  world  demonstrates  that  reaching  scale \nand economic sustainability is a long process. A more direct route to supporting large portions of the \nlow-income population is through meso-level coverage, of portfolios of micro-loans. \n \nSubstantial  natural  catastrophe  risk  resides  in  the  loan  portfolios  of  the  MFI  sector. \n70. \nAppropriate  management  of  this  risk  provides  dual  benefits\u2014it  protects  against  low-income \nindividuals  sliding  into  greater  hardship  after  a  major  disaster,  while  also  potentially  catalyzing \neconomic activity through providing additional financing to MFI clients. \n \n71. \nThe MFI sector in Bangladesh already has an established insurance element and can thus be a \nstrong partner in disaster risk financing, although the catastrophe exposure of MFIs must be managed \nvery  differently  to  credit  life  or  health  insurance,  which  are  the  predominant  forms  of  insurance \ncurrently offered by MFIs. Portfolio protection for MFIs would bring a rapid influx of new liquidity after \nmajor  loan-stressing  events.  This  would  enable  not  only  restructuring  of  existing  loans  but,  more \nimportantly, distribution of new loans. New capital influx through existing channels to existing (good) \nMFI clients has a large multiplying effect in generating economic activity and allowing the long-term \nreconstruction financing to run through local markets, not bypass them. \n \n72. \nThe  total  outstanding  loan  balance  in  the  MFI  sector  is  estimated  around  $3.5  billion. \nAssuming that 90% of the loans are climate-exposed, there is an overall exposure of $3.15 billion. The \nnational modeled loss rate relative to GDP for a 1-in-100-year event is just under 5% for cyclone and \nalmost 8.5% for flood. Taking into account the relatively higher vulnerability of NGO and MFI clients \nagainst national exposure, a loss rate of 10% for a 1-in-100-year event seems reasonable, leading to a \nloss or impairment against the national NGO and MFI loan portfolio of $315 million. If fully covered, \nthis would comprise around 60% of the identified funding gap for the MFIs and NGOs (Figure 10). \n \n73. \nincluding \n \n\nHowever,  a  number  of  elements  would  need  to  be  in  place  for  such  a  scheme  to  be  viable, \n\n(i)(cid:3)\n\ncompulsory participation of all MFIs with climate-exposed loan portfolios, implemented \nalongside a simple risk assessment process to identify and quantify the covariant weather \nrisk of each MFI; \n\n(cid:3)\n\n\fDisaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh \n\n25 \n\n(ii)(cid:3)\n\na  simple  parametric  product  structure  at  the  MFI  level,  such  that  the  particular \nvulnerabilities  and  geographic  distribution  of  the  loan  portfolio  can  be  captured  but \nwithout the detailed and costly risk analysis; \n\n(iii)(cid:3) a constant rating structure and an efficient vehicle to underwrite cover and pool the risk; \n(iv)(cid:3) capitalization of the risk pool; and \n(v)(cid:3)\n\ntechnical assistance program and required contingency planning for MFIs to ensure that \nbenefits of risk transfer are passed on to clients. \n\n \nPKSF\u2019s Covariant Risk Fund would appear to provide a significant head  start on a  number of \n74. \nthese critical components of a portfolio microinsurance pool, although experience from elsewhere in \nthe  region  and  globally  would  need  to  be  closely  investigated  to  ensure  that  any  program  would  be \nsustainable in the medium to long term. \n \n \n\nVII.      RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n \n75. \nUncovered  financial  risk  from  disasters  places  a  significant  downward  pressure  on  the \ncountry\u2019s economic growth. Financial costs from disasters are sudden and catastrophic and aggravate \ndirect  disaster  impacts.  Thus,  it  is  necessary  to  integrate  disaster  risk  financing  strategies  into  the \noverall  disaster  risk  management  and  public  finance  management  to  minimize  the  financial  and \neconomic consequences of disasters for the households, the private sectors, and the government. \n \n76. \nBased on the risk profiles and present institutional and policy  context, three specific disaster \nrisk finance options are identified for Bangladesh\u2014sovereign contingency credit, direct sovereign risk \ntransfer to the international market, and microfinance portfolio protection to provide risk financing for \nthe low-income population.  \n \n77. \nPolicy makers, regulators, and private sectors are strongly recommended to consider adopting \ndisaster risk financing options that are suitable to each institution\u2019s mandate and capacity. The three \noptions  are  recommended  as  feasible  options  that  can  be  implemented  with  little  or  moderate \ninvestment under the present Bangladesh environment. \n \n78. \nto develop appropriate financial management policies for disasters, including \n \n\nIn addition to the options, policy makers, in particular budget policy makers, are recommended \n\n(i)(cid:3)\n\nensuring integrating disaster risk financing strategies into the overall disaster risk \nmanagement and public finance management; \nassessing the fiscal impacts of disaster risks; \n\n(ii)(cid:3)\n(iii)(cid:3) developing  clear  rules  and  systems  on  postdisaster  financial  arrangements,  including \n\nrapid and accountable relief, recovery, and reconstruction resource distribution; \n\n(iv)(cid:3) promoting sound financial sector and microfinance sector development with respect to \ndisaster risks including proper regulation, business continuity, and contingency planning; \nand \n\n(v)(cid:3) providing  continuous  information  dissemination  and  training  activities  on  disaster  risks \nto  various  stakeholders,  such  as  disaster  risk  management  related  agencies,  banks, \nfinancial institutions, NGOs, and MFIs. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fADB South Asia Working Paper Series No. 46 \n\n26 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n \nADB. 2015.

This funding gap is partly attributed to insufficient financial \npreparedness in disaster risk management. The limited postdisaster funding negatively affected the economy \nin terms of lowered economic growth and increased poverty. Applying appropriate disaster risk financing is key \nto minimizing economic impacts from disasters and sustain the country\u2019s development.\n\nabout the asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries \nreduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains \nhome to half of the world\u2019s extreme poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping \nits developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and \ntechnical assistance. \n\nDisaster risk Financing \nin\u00a0BanglaDesh\n\nMayumi Ozaki\n\nnO. 46\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nADB SOUTH ASIA  \nWOrkIng PAPer SerIeS \n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n \n \nADB South Asia Working Paper Series \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDisaster Risk Financing in Bangladesh \n", "(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\nMayumi Ozaki \n", "No. 46   (cid:95)   September 2016 \n", "(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n", "(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\nMayumi Ozaki is senior portfolio management specialist, \nPublic Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division, \nSouth Asia Department, Asian Development Bank. \n", " \n \n \n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "(cid:3)\n", " \n", "    Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO) \n", " \n", " \n", " \n\u00a9 2016 Asian Development Bank \n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines \nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444 \nwww.adb.org \n \nSome rights reserved.
