INTRODUCTION: THE PARADIGN SHIFT IN THE \n\nCONCEPT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION \n\nAmong  economists,  the  general  consensus  is  that  financial  development  acts  as  a \ncatalyst  in  the  overall  growth  and  development  of  an  economy.  Moreover,  empirical \nresearch  demonstrates  that  development  of  a  strong,  sound  financial  system \ncontributes  to  economic  growth  (Rajan  and  Zingales  2003).  As  a  result,  most \ndeveloping  country  governments  are  promoting  financial  inclusion 1 as  a  policy  goal, \nespecially for those who are ignored by formal sector institutions.  \n\nIn  India,  financial  inclusion  has  always  been  a  priority,  given  the  country\u2019s  socialist \nbeginnings. Since 1969, when banks were nationalized, the strategy for addressing the \nbanking  needs  of  the  poor  has  been  biased  toward  providing  credit,  neglecting  other \naspects, such as building a deposit base, promoting a savings culture, or extending the \npayment  network.  This  credit  drive  was  implemented  in  two  ways:  (i)  directing  a \nsignificant fraction of credit directly to credit-starved poor households and micro, small, \nand medium-sized  enterprises (MSMEs)  through  priority  sector targets for  banks;  and \n(ii)  creating  specialized  entities,  such  as  regional  rural  banks  and  cooperative  banks. \nThis policy has met with limited success, as banks find it difficult to reach the intended \nbeneficiaries,  instead  meeting  their  priority  sector  targets  by  lending  to  other \nintermediaries, such as microfinance institutions (MFIs) that have emerged largely due \nto the failure of banks to promote financial inclusion.  \n\nHowever, over the last decade, India\u2019s financial inclusion agenda has seen a paradigm \nshift  from  an  emphasis  on  credit  to  a  more  comprehensive  approach  toward  financial \nservices, particularly opening bank accounts and offering basic financial products such \nas  insurance.  This  shift  has  been  partly  driven  by  the  need  to  achieve  other  public \npolicy  goals,  such  as  replacing  product  subsidies  with  cash  transfers,  which  requires \nbeneficiaries to have bank accounts for expediting the transfers. The concern regarding \ngrowing macroeconomic imbalances, such as a fall in the rate of financial savings that \npartly reflects a lack of adequate penetration of bank branches, has also been a driver. \n\nThis  new  approach  necessitates  a  change  in  the  financial  architecture  of  India\u2019s \neconomy.  Since  bank  account  creation  is  an  integral  part  of  the  agenda,  banks  must  \nbe  more  directly  involved,  as  regulations  mandate  deposit  taking  as  their  exclusive \ndomain.  Their  efforts  also  need  to  be  supplemented  by  intermediaries,  such  as \nbusiness correspondents. Moreover, access to a robust payment network warrants the \nentry  of  specialist  payment  banks.  Thus,  the  new  inclusion  drive  involves  multiple \nentities,  and  further  involves  MFIs.  Yet  there  is  a  need  for  balance:  risks,  such  as \nstability,  solvency,  anti-money  laundering,  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism, \nmust  be  addressed  through  regulation,  while  also  ensuring  that  such  regulation  does \nnot stifle inclusion. \n\nIt is important to note that financially excluded households and microenterprises must \ndeal  entirely  in  cash  yet  are  susceptible  to  irregular  and  uncertain  cash  flows. \nMoreover,  due  to  lack  of  access  to  formal  institutions,  financially  excluded  segments \n\n                                                \n1   In  2008,  the  Committee  on  Financial  Inclusion  defined  financial  inclusion  as  \u201cthe  process  of  ensuring \naccess to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as \nweaker sections and low income groups at an affordable cost\u201d (Rangarajan 2008). This definition was \nlater  enhanced  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI):  \u201cfinancial  inclusion  is  the  process  of  ensuring \naccess  to  appropriate  financial  products  and  services  needed  by  vulnerable  groups  such  as  weaker \nsections and low income groups at an affordable cost in a fair and transparent manner by mainstream \ninstitutional players\u201d (RBI 2014a).  \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nhave limited options for building assets or saving for their old age. The lack of savings \nand savings avenues forces them to approach informal sources of finance, which often \ncharge 60%\u2013100% in annual interest payments. Exposure to high rates of interest, and \nthe  inability  to  service  such  loans,  ensures  that  these  borrowers  remain  trapped  in \ndebt, exacerbating the cycle of poverty. The new agenda for financial inclusion seeks \nto address both of these long-standing concerns for India. \n\n2.  STRUCTURE OF THE BANKING AND \n\nMICROFINANCE INSTITUTION SECTOR IN INDIA \n\nSoon  after  independence  in  1947,  a  highly  regulated  banking  system  was  put  into \nplace.  Nationalization  of  the  Imperial  Bank,  as  the  State  Bank  of  India  in  1955,  was \nfollowed in 1969 by 14 private sector commercial banks. In 1991, the banking industry \nwas  deregulated  by  allowing  entry  of  new  private  sector  banks  and  increasing  the  \nlimit  of  foreign  equity  to  74%  in  private  sector  banks.  Simultaneously,  licensing  of \nbranches of domestic-scheduled commercial banks was phased out, and interest rates \nwere deregulated.  \n\nToday,  India\u2019s  banking  sector  is  diversified  (Table  1),  reflecting  the  banking  needs  of \nvarious  sectors.  Besides  typical  commercial  banks,  which  operate  on  all-India  basis, \nthere  are  small  banks  with  limited  areas  of  operation  that  were  set  up  to  further \nfinancial inclusion and poverty alleviation. Credit cooperatives serve the needs of small \nand  marginal  farmers  as  well  as  the  poor  in  urban  and  semi-urban  areas.  Regional \nrural banks were created to bring together the positive features of credit cooperatives \nand commercial banks to address the credit needs of poor rural areas (Gandhi 2015). \nLocal area banks were expected to fortify the institutional credit framework in rural and \nsemi-urban areas.  \n\nIndeed,  India\u2019s  banking  system  has  grown  rapidly  over  the  years  (Table  2).  Over  the \nlast  decade,  India  has  witnessed  a  credit  boom,  with  the  share  of  credit\u2013gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  increasing  from  35.5%  in  2000  to  51.0%  in  2013,  the  bulk \naccounted for by bank lending (MOF 2015b).2  \n\nPublic  sector  banks  dominate  the  landscape,  with  a  market  share  in  total  deposits  of \naround 74.0%; the share in total advances was 73.2% as of March 2015 (Table 3). Yet \ntheir performance, compared to their private sector counterparts, has been weak. Their \ngross  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  were  4.36% versus  3.83% for  all  banks; their total \nstressed  assets  were  10.67%  versus  9.03%  for  all  banks.  New  private  sector  banks \nrecorded  much  lower  NPLs  of  1.73%  and  total  stressed  assets  of  3.28%.  Of  course, \nthere is significant variation in performance across public sector banks (RBI 2013b).  \n\nA specific challenge confronting banking in India is to resource public sector banks to \novercome the problem of stressed and restructured assets to meet the imminent Basel \nIII  requirements  of  capital  adequacy.  Recapitalization  requirements  for  public  sector \nbanks  have  been  estimated  to  range  from  Rs48  trillion  ($800  billion)  to  Rs100  trillion \n($1.6  trillion),  depending  on  the  assumptions  of  forbearance  and  ratio  of  restructured \nassets turning into NPLs (RBI 2014c).  \n\n \n\n                                                \n2   Empirically, it has been shown that as countries become richer, they tend to see a rise in credit, but the \nshare  of  the  banking  sector  in  total  credit  shrinks  over  the  course  of  development  relative  to  other \nsources of funding such as capital markets (MOF 2015b). \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nTable 1: Structure of Banking in India \n\nType of Bank \nCommercial \nBanks \n\nComposition \nPublic sector banks (26) \n(72,661 branches) \n\nPrivate sector banks (20) \n\nForeign banks (43) \nRegional rural banks (64) \nLocal area banks (4) \n\nRural cooperatives (93,551) \n\nCooperative \nBanks \n\nUrban cooperative banks (1,606)  Multistate urban cooperative \n\n43 \n\nBank Name \n\nState Bank of India  \nAssociate banks  \nNationalized banks  \nOther public sector banks  \nOld private sector  \nNew private sector banks  \nBranch mode of presence  \nLimited area of operation  \nLimited area of operation  \n\nbanks \nSingle state urban \ncooperative banks \nShort term  \nState cooperative banks \nDistrict central cooperative \nbanks \nPrimary agriculture operative \nsocieties \nLong term  \nState cooperative agriculture \nand rural development banks \nPrimary cooperative \nagriculture and rural \ndevelopment banks \n\nArohan, Bandhan, BSS, \nCashpor, Disha, Equitas, \nESAF, Grama Vidiyal  \n\nNumber of \nBranches \n14,699 \n5,482 \n52,480 \n1 \n6,047 \n9,522 \n332 \n \n \n\n1,563 \n\n92,834 \n31 \n371 \n\n92,432 \n\n717 \n20 \n\n697 \n\n10,553 \n\nMicrofinance \nInstitutions  \n\nThere are 52 microfinance \ninstitutions that have either \nreceived or applied for registration \nfrom the Reserve Bank of India as \nof June 2015.

Most  formal \nfinancial institutions are reluctant to serve them and MSMEs because of perceived high \nrisks, high costs involved in small transactions, low relative profitability, and inability to \nprovide  the  physical  collateral  usually  required  by  such  institutions  (IMF  2004).  In \ntechnical  terms,  problems  of  adverse  selection  and  information  asymmetries  make  it \ndifficult for financial institutions to screen and to monitor credit decisions.  \n\nTo  address this market failure  and to  provide financial  services  to  low-income  clients, \nMFIs emerged, although their character has undergone a shift from the time that they \ncommenced  operations.  The  pioneer  MFIs  operated  as  nonprofit,  nongovernment \norganizations  with  a  strong  social  focus.  They  developed  new  credit  techniques; \ninstead of requiring collateral, they reduced risk through group guarantees, appraisals \nof  household  cash  flow,  and  small  initial  loans  to  test  clients. 3  Today,  however,  \nMFIs  have  changed  from  nongovernment  organizations  to  nonbanking  finance \ncompanies  (NBFCs),  and  there  has  been  a  modification  in  how  they  raise  finance. \nOnce primarily donor-led, MFIs are now increasingly funded by banks and private and \nshareholder equity. \n\nCurrently, the regulated microfinance market in India has over 30 million clients, served \nby  nearly  50  regulated  institutions  with  a  gross  loan  portfolio  of  about  $7  billion, \nreflecting  growth  of  61%  over  2013\u201314  (MicroMeter  2015).  The  10  largest  MFIs \naccount for 75% of the total industry loans. MFIs have a network of 10,553 branches, \nwith 80,097 employees across 32 states and union territories. MFI activity is only set to \ngrow,  especially  because  only  8%  of  adults  have  loans  from  formal  financial \ninstitutions.  Only  35%  have  bank  accounts,  of  which  more  than  half  are  inactive  or \nsemi-active (World Bank 2015). \n\n3.  STATE OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION \n\nIndia\u2019s record of financial inclusion, despite the existence of a large and well-regulated \nfinancial system dominated by commercial banks, is poor. Judging by aggregate macro \ndata,  the  household  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  of  8.9%  is  among  the  lowest  in  the  region, \ncontrasted  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  at  36.8%  and  Thailand  at  around \n83.0%. 4 The  absence  of  inclusion  is  especially  conspicuous  in  rural  India,  home  to \naround  60%  of  the  population.  In  2013\u201314,  deposits  per  head  were  only  Rs9,244 \n(about $154) in rural areas, with credit about Rs6,000 (about $100) per head (Table 4). \n\n                                                \n3  Experience has shown that the poor repay uncollateralized loans reliably and are willing to pay the full \n\ncost of providing them; access is more important to them than cost. \n\n4  Citi Research \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nThat  said, there  are  sections  of the  urban  population  (e.g., migrant  labor)  who  do  not \nhave access to the formal financial sector as well. \n\nTable 4: Per Capita Deposits and Credit in Rural and Urban India \n(Rs) \n\n  \nFiscal Year \n\n2007\u201308 \n2008\u201309 \n2009\u201310 \n2010\u201311 \n2011\u201312 \n2012\u201313 \n2013\u201314 \n\nRural \n\nUrban \n\nDeposits \n3,735 \n4,441 \n5,088 \n5,924 \n6,830 \n7,923 \n9,244 \n\nCredit \n3,977 \n3,779 \n4,662 \n4,713 \n5,269 \n6,197 \n6,161 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDeposits \n85,003 \n100,146 \n113,747 \n131,303 \n144,138 \n162,145 \n178,942 \n\nCredit \n60,405 \n71,437 \n81,313 \n98,772 \n114,185 \n127,854 \n143,718 \n\nSource:  Author  estimates  based  on  the  data  from  RBI.

The number of branches per 100,000 people in the rural segment is roughly \none-third of that in urban areas (Table 5).  \n\nTable 5: Number of Branches of Banks in Rural and Urban Centers \n(per 100,000 population) \n\nFiscal Year \n\n2007\u201308 \n2008\u201309 \n2009\u201310 \n2010\u201311 \n2011\u201312 \n2012\u201313 \n2013\u201314 \n\nRural  \n3.79 \n3.84 \n3.93 \n4.08 \n4.35 \n4.70 \n5.25 \n\nUrban  \n13.05 \n13.65 \n14.49 \n15.28 \n16.22 \n16.99 \n17.91 \n\nSource:  Author  estimates  based  on  the  data  from  RBI.

The \nsurvey  showed  that  while  India  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  terms  of  financial \ndeepening  and  widening,  a  large  percentage  of  the  population  lacks  access  to  basic \nfinancial services. Table 7 shows there are only 13.3 ATMs per 100,000 adults in India, \nthe lowest in the sample. Similarly, at 12.2 commercial branches per 100,000 adults, it \nis lowest in the group, with the exception of Indonesia.

In  2009,  the  government  mandated  that  the  transfer  of  wages  under  the \nMahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Act  (MNREGA)  be  made \ndirectly  to  the  bank  accounts  of  the  workers.  The  objective  was  twofold:  to  reduce \nleakages, and to widen the access to basic banking services.5 However, the number of \nloans  with  commercial  banks  remains  low,  indicating  that  most  of  these  accounts  are \nused merely for receiving wages. \n\nAnother survey conducted by the World Bank captured how adults save, borrow, make \npayments,  and  manage  risk  (Table  8).  The  data  showed  that  despite  vigorous \npromotion of the use of electronic modes of payment over paper-based payments, the \nformer is still at a nascent stage in India. Only 2.0% of people surveyed said that they \nuse  electronic  methods  for  payment.  Further,  while  22.4%  people  saved  money,  only \n11.6% did so at a formal financial institution.  \n\n                                                \n5   The MGNREGA is a law whereby any adult who applies for employment in rural areas must be given \nwork  on  local  public  works  within  15  days.  If  employment  is  not  given,  an  unemployment  allowance \nmust be paid.

A recent \ninitiative toward these goals has been the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), \nan  ambitious  plan  that  seeks  to  cover  each  household  in  India  with  a  bank  account.6 \nOver 190 million Jan Dhan accounts were operational in October 2015.7 In fact, on the \nfirst  day  of  the  program,  15  million  bank  accounts  were  opened.  Account  holders  are \ngiven  a  debit  and  a  credit  card,  while  microinsurance  is  likely  to  be  added  later.  It  is \n\n                                                \n6   The  PMJDY  has  six  pillars:  (i)  universal  access  to  banking  facilities;  (ii)  provision  of  a  basic  bank \naccount  with  overdraft,  and  a  RuPay  debit  card  to  all  households;  (iii)  encouragement  of  financial \nliteracy to enable use of financial products; (iv) a credit guarantee fund to mitigate risks stemming from \noverdraft facilities extended to these accounts; (v) provision of microinsurance for all account holders; \nand (vi) unorganized sector pension schemes, such as Swavalamban Yojana. \n\n7  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. http://www.pmjdy.gov.in/account-statistics-country.aspx \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nenvisaged  that  after  6  months,  account  holders  will  be  entitled  to  overdraft  facilities  \nas well. \n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also made an effort over the last decade to create \nbasic financial  service facilities for  the  excluded. In  April  2005,  it recognized  that  vast \nsections  of  the  population  did  not  have  access  to  banking  services  due  to  minimum \nbalance requirements. To achieve greater access, RBI counseled banks to open basic \nbanking or \u201cno-frills\u201d accounts with no or very low minimum balances and no or minimal \ncharges.  Conceding  the  stigma  associated  with  the  nomenclature  \u201cno-frills,\u201d  banks \nwere advised to offer a \u201cbasic savings bank deposit account\u201d (BSBDA) with simplified \nknow-your-customer norms.8  \n\nUntil March 2014, 243 million BSBDAs were on the books of banks, but the increase in \nthe  number  of  accounts is  not reflected  in  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  number of \ntransactions  (RBI  2014a).  Table  9  shows  that  outstanding  deposits  in  BSBDAs  were \nonly  Rs312.3  billion,  while  overdraft  used  in  these  accounts  was  only  Rs16.0  billion. \nMoreover,  most  of  the  MNREGA  accounts  are  only  used  to  receive  wages; \nbeneficiaries  withdraw  their  money  immediately  after  it  is  deposited,  leaving  very  low \nbalances  in  these  accounts  (RBI  2014a).  Even  in  the  PMJDY  Jan  Dhan  accounts, \nmany new bank accounts remain dormant, resulting in costs for banks and limited gain \nto the beneficiaries. According to one estimate, 80% of accounts opened do not have \ntransactions,  revealing  that  the  account  holders  are  still  not  really  financially  included \n(Patel 2014). \n\nTable 9: Banking Penetration Progress, 2010\u20132014 \n\n \n\nBanking outlets in villages \nBranches \nBusiness correspondents \nOther modes \nTotal \nUrban locations through business \ncorrespondents \nBasic savings bank deposit account \nbranches \nNo. in millions \nAmount in Rs billion \nBasic savings bank deposit account \nbusiness correspondents \nNo. in millions \nAmount in Rs billion \nOverdraft availed in basic savings  \nbank deposit accounts \nNo. in millions \nAmount in Rs billion \nKisan credit cards \n(No. in millions) \n\nSource: RBI 2014. \n\nFY 2010 \n \n\nFY 2011 \n \n\nFY 2012 \n \n\nFY 2013 \n \n\nFY 2014 \n \n\n33,378 \n34,174 \n142 \n67,674 \n447 \n\n34,811 \n80,802 \n595 \n116,208 \n3,771 \n\n37,471 \n141,136 \n3,146 \n181,753 \n5,891 \n\n40,837 \n221,341 \n6,276 \n268,454 \n27,143 \n\n46,126 \n337,678 \n \n383,804 \n60,730 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n60.19 \n44.33 \n \n\n13.27 \n10.69 \n \n\n0.18 \n0.10 \n24.31 \n\n73.13 \n57.89 \n \n\n31.63 \n18.23 \n \n\n0.61 \n0.26 \n27.11 \n\n81.20 \n109.87 \n \n\n100.80 \n164.69 \n \n\n57.30 \n10.54 \n \n\n2.71 \n1.08 \n30.24 \n\n81.27 \n18.22 \n \n\n3.92 \n1.55 \n33.79 \n\n126.00 \n273.30 \n \n\n116.90 \n39.00 \n \n\n5.90 \n16.00 \n39.90 \n\n                                                \n8  There  are  three  basic  requirement  for  BSBDAs:  (i)  all  credits  in  a  financial  year  cannot  exceed \nRs100,000; (ii) withdrawals and transfers per month cannot exceed Rs10,000; and (iii) balances at any \npoint cannot exceed Rs50,000. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nThe  inference  is that  bundling  of government  welfare  payments  into  BSBDAs  through \ndirect cash transfers is only necessary for ensuring that the accounts are used.

DELIVERY MODELS, REGULATIONS, AND OTHER \n\nISSUES \n\n4.1  The Mor Committee \n\nA  comprehensive  blueprint  for  the  architecture  of  inclusion  was  created  by  the  Mor \nCommittee  on  Comprehensive  Financial  Services \nfor  Small  Businesses  and  \nLow-Income  Households  in  2014.  This  committee  proposed  the  following  to  be \nachieved  by  1  January  2016:  (i)  provision  to  each  resident  over  age  18  years  of  an \nindividual,  full-service  electronic  bank  account;  (ii)  establishment  of  widely  distributed \nelectronic  payment  access  points,  offering  deposit  and  withdrawal  facilities  at \nreasonable cost; (iii) provision to each low-income household of convenient access to \nformally  regulated  providers  that  can  provide  suitable  credit  products,  investment  and \ndeposit products, and insurance and risk management products at reasonable prices; \nand (iv) provision to every customer of the legally protected right to be offered suitable \nfinancial services.  \n\nOne  criticism  of  the  recommendations  was  that  the  targets  and  timelines  set  by  the \ncommittee  were  aggressive.  RBI  identified  490,000  villages,  and  allotted  them  to \nvarious  banks  for  coverage  by  2016.  This  entailed  that  these  banks  open  80,000 \nadditional rural branches during 2013\u20132016. Only 7,459 rural branches were, however, \nopened.  The  committee\u2019s  recommendations  were  also  skewed  toward  payments  and \ndeposit  creation,  and  inadequate  in  ensuring  improved  credit  delivery  or  risk  products \nto the poor.  \n\nFigure 1: Present Financial Architecture and Banking System Design \n\nThe  Mor  Committee  did  recognize  that  an  optimally  designed  banking  system  for  \nIndia  must  involve  a  mix  of  horizontally  differentiated  and  vertically  differentiated \nbanking  systems  (Figure  1).  Banking  systems  across  the  world  are  based  on  these  \ntwo designs: (i) horizontally differentiated, in which the basic design element remains a \nfull-service  bank  that  combines  the  three  building  blocks  of  payments,  deposits,  and \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\ncredit  but  is  differentiated  primarily  on  size,  geography,  or  sector;  and  (ii)  vertically \ndifferentiated, in which the full-service bank is replaced by banks that specialize in one \nor  more  of  the  building  blocks  of  payments,  deposits,  and  credit  (i.e.,  a  functional \ndesign configuration).  \n\n4.2  Small Banks \n\nGlobally,  small  banks  have  been  seen  as  a  crucial  link  in  the  process  of  financial \ninclusion. This belief has led to the creation of a range of structures in India\u2019s financial \nsystem, such as regional rural banks, united community banks, and local area banks. \nThese are locally governed and funded out of the local deposit base. As per RBI data, \nas of 2012\u201313, the total number of regional rural bank offices stood above 17,000, with \nabout  75%  located  in  rural  areas.  They  were  created  in  the  mid-1970s  and  1980s \nlargely  on  the  back  of  regulatory  advantage  of  lower  capital  adequacy  norms  as \nsubsidiaries of sponsor commercial banks. Yet by the end of 1990s, most turned out to \nbe unviable. The number of regional rural banks has dwindled from 196 to 62 over the \nyears (Subbarao 2013). Further, only four of six local area banks in India, licensed by \nRBI, are functioning, with the rest shut down primarily due to mismanagement.  \n\nGlobal  evidence  regarding  the  performance  of  small  banks  is  mixed.  Small  banks  in \ndeveloping  countries  (e.g.,  Ghana  and  Nigeria)  have  solvency  problems.  The  United \nStates  model  is  also  beginning  to  develop  cracks,  mainly  due  to  the  failure  of  such \nbanks  to  keep  pace  with  the  advancement  in  banking  technology  (RBI  2014b). \nRegional  banks  in  Germany  and  Switzerland,  on  the  other  hand,  are  backed  by  an \neffective risk management structure and have thus been able to survive.  \n\nAlthough small banks do possess certain benefits in the form of low-cost, customized \nservices per local needs and near absence of contagion effects, they are vulnerable to \ncapture  and  concentration  risk,  owing  to  localization  of  their  operations  and  political \ninfluence (RBI 2014b). There are other risks of commodity price volatility and weather \nvagaries,  which  create  the  need  for  a  high  capital  adequacy  ratio.  Moreover,  small \nbanks  cannot  experience  economies  of  scale,  as  they  are  expected  to  operate  within \nspecified limits. They also lack the capacity to finance big projects.   \n\nSmallness  or  localization  does  not  present  a  strong  case  for  their  creation  based  on \nregulatory  forbearance.  The  licensing  of  new  banks  should  instead  be  driven  by  the \nlevel playing field principle, and if a local NBFC or other candidate for a license has the \nfinancial strength or eligibility, it should be given a license. Indeed, 8 of the 10 entities \ngranted a license for small finance banks by RBI recently are MFIs.9 The key reason to \nconvert into a small finance bank is access to deposits; they will also be able to offer a \nwider range of loan products to customers. The converted companies must follow the \npricing structure of banks, which is linked to their base rate.   \n\n4.3  Microfinance Institutions \n\nMFIs who did not receive a small bank license or did not apply also remain integral to \nthe  objective  of  inclusion.  After  a  turbulent  year  in  2010,  the  microfinance  industry  in \nIndia  has  undergone  some  significant  changes  in  regulations  and  operations. 10 The \ncrisis of 2010 stemmed from extremely high and often usurious interest rates, coercive \n\n                                                \n9  Disha Microfin, Equitas Holdings, ESAF Microfinance and Investments, Janalakshmi Financial Services, \nRGVN  (North  East)  Microfinance,  Suryoday  Micro  Finance,  Ujjivan  Financial  Services,  and  Utkarsh \nMicro Finance. RBI (2015).  \n\n10  See Shylendra (2006) for an account of the crisis.  \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\ndebt  collection  practices,  and  multiple  lending.  All  three  problems  related  to  the \ninterface between the borrower and MFI. In 2011, RBI mandated clear communication \nof  lending  rates,  tenure  of  loans,  repayment  flexibility,  and  the  need  to  create  a \ncustomer  redress  mechanism.  MFIs  have  retained  their  priority  sector  lending  status, \nwhile RBI has recently introduced self-regulatory initiatives such as the Industry Code \nof Conduct and development of a credit bureau toward responsible microfinance.  \n\nThe  industry  bodies  of  MFIs,  the  MicroFinance  Institutions  Network  (MFIN)  and  \nSa-Dhan,  are  now  recognized  as  self-regulated organizations  by  the  central bank.11 It \nis not yet clear if they will report to RBI or the newly created Micro Units Development \nand  Refinance  Agency  (MUDRA)  Bank.  12 Self-regulation  is  tricky  and  does  not  imply \ndiscretionary regulation; it is simply a model of regulatory outsourcing that obliges the \norganization to monitor members and to ensure compliance with the extant regulations \nof  the  central  bank,  including  responsible  lending.  Self-regulated  organizations  are \nrequired  to  formulate  a  code  of  conduct  and  have  an  effective  grievance  redress \nsystem  for  borrowers  and  a  dispute  resolution  structure  for  members.  In  the  current \nframework,  MFIs  can  report  to  Sa-Dhan  or  MFIN,  which  is  not  necessarily  good  for \nregulatory  efficiency.  Moreover,  such  competition  could  result  in  regulatory  arbitrage, \nsince, in practice, some MFIs could be members of both Sa-Dhan and MFIN.13  \n\nAn area where self-regulated organizations could be immediately effective is in aligning \ninterest  charges  of  members  with  their  costs.  This  would  lead  to  price  differentials \nacross NBFCs that would both exert downward pressure on interest charges and lead \nto  greater  operating  efficiency  in  the  system.  While  the  more  efficient  may  see  a \ntemporary  drop  in  margins,  it  would  benefit  them  in  the  long  term.  Less-efficient \ncompanies would see a loss in business volume, while the fitter should see their losses \nin margins offset by a rise in volume. \n\n4.4  Business Correspondents \n\nAnother significant regulatory change toward financial inclusion has been the relaxing \nof  norms  for  business  correspondents  or  bank  mitras  (i.e.,  agents  of  the  bank)  to \ncomplement  the  classical  approach  of  physical  branch-led  distribution.  Business \ncorrespondents  provide  last-mile  connectivity  for  financial  services  in  remote  and \nunderbanked locations. While initially restrictive in the kind of players who can qualify \nas business correspondents, the norm has been significantly eased, as it is now open \nto profit-making entities.  \n\nBusiness  correspondents  are  microbankers  who  are  outside  of  the  purview  of \nregulators. They are \u201cprotected\u201d by the capital of a sponsor bank, but since they do not \nprovide  any  capital  themselves,  the  moral  hazard  of  risky  lending  becomes  a  distinct \npossibility.  Banks  in  Brazil  and India  have  been uncomfortable  with  allowing  business \n\n                                                \n11  In  March  2015,  Sa-Dhan,  an  association  of  MFIs,  was  accorded  the  status  of  a  self-regulatory \norganization,  which  gave  it powers  to  monitor  MFIs  and  to ensure  the lenders  are  in compliance  with \nrules. Sa-Dhan is the second association to be given this status by the central bank; MFIN was given \nthat status in 2014.  \n\n12  MUDRA  Bank  was  launched  on  8  April  2015  to  provide  formal  or  institutional  financial  support  to  the \nnoncorporate small business sector. The bank with an initial corpus of $3.5 billion is charged to provide \naccess of formal systems of credit to the \u201cbottom-of-the-pyramid\u201d entrepreneurs, popularly known as the \n\u201cmissing middle.\u201d  \n\n13  Since the model for the sector is new, however, it is too early to comment on the utility. It takes time for \ninstitutions  to  establish  the  desirable  characteristics  of  independence  and  credibility;  the  test  lies  in \nactual  behavior  of  the  institution  when  faced  with  difficult  decisions  that  involve  substantial  interest \ngroup conflict (Melody 1997).  \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\ncorrespondents  to  lend.  There  has  been  some  effort  to  overcome  this  moral  hazard \nproblem,  allowing  business  correspondents to  hold  capital  against the  loans  that they \nsanction.14 Given  that financial  viability  remains  an  issue,  it  is  still  a  question  whether \nthe business correspondent model can be scaled.  \n\n4.5  Payment System \n\nA  policy  in  India  encouraging  large  financial  institutions  to  customize  products  for  \nlow-income  customers  enjoyed  only  moderate  success,  triggering  a  review  by  RBI  \nthat  led  to  the  creation  of  new  regulatory  financial  and  architecture. 15 In  2015,  RBI \ngranted  approval  to  set  up  11  payment  banks  and  10  small  finance  banks  (RBI  \n2015). Payment banks are permitted to accept demand deposits (i.e., current deposits) \nand  savings  bank  deposits  from  individuals,  small  businesses,  and  other  entities.  \nThey  are  restricted  to  holding  a  maximum  balance  of  Rs100,000  per  individual \ncustomer, and they cannot issue credit cards or undertake lending activities. Payment \nbanks  are  permitted  to  set  up  outlets  such  as  branches  and  ATMs,  and  to  appoint \nbusiness  correspondents.  Small finance  banks will  undertake  basic  banking activities, \nsuch  as  acceptance  of  deposits  and  lending  to  unserved  and  underserved  sections, \nincluding small business units, small and marginal farmers, MSMEs, and unorganized \nsector entities.  \n\nA  large  informal  sector  and  a  vast  pool  of  migrant  workers  means  that  a  sizeable \nfraction of transactions in India, estimated at 65%, occur in cash (RBI 2009). Informal \nchannels  for  cash  transfers  exist  but  are  expensive  and  inefficient  compared  to \nelectronic  methods.  Thus,  a  critical  aim  of  the  inclusion  agenda  is  the  provision  of  a \nrobust payment system that minimizes the use of cash. This involves the convergence \nof  banking,  digitization,  and  mobile  phones  as  invoked  in  the  JAM  Number  Trinity \nsolution  (i.e.,  Jan  Dhan  Yojana,  Aadhaar  cards,  and  mobile  numbers)  proposed  in  \nthe  Economic  Survey  2014\u201315  that  allows  the  state  to  transfer  subsidies  to  poor \nhouseholds in a targeted manner.  \n\nWhile enhancing payment efficiency is the principal objective, products such as digital \nwallets can also function as savings instruments earning interest.16 Yet although most \nscheduled commercial banks have the credentials and balance sheet strength to offer \nmobile-based financial products, the key question relates to the desirability of entry of \nnonbank  participants  into  this  space.  Currently,  27  private  participants  (i.e.,  pre-paid \ninstrument  providers)  are  allowed  to  offer  digital  wallets  up  to  Rs50,000  that  must  be \nbacked  by  escrow  deposits  placed  with  a  commercial  bank.  While  expansion  of  this \nprivate  network  will  help  inclusion,  there  are  potential  risks.  For  any  money  transfer \nscheme,  customer  authentication  becomes  critical.17 There  is  merit  in  converting  pre-\npaid  instrument  providers  to  payment  banks,  as  RBI  has  recently  done,  as  mobile \nwallets gain the status of deposits and earn returns (RBI 2009). \n\n                                                \n14  ICICI Bank in 2005\u201306 successfully experimented with the concept of a credit franchisee, who is similar \nto a business correspondent or facilitator but was required to place a fixed deposit with the bank of 10% \nof the amount of loans that he or she would sanction. Upon default, the deposit would function as a first \nloss deficiency guarantee. \n\n15  For a brief analytic discussion, see NCAER (2011)  \n16  The success of mobile wallets and fully digital banking in African economies (e.g., the M-PESA model in \nKenya)  is  well  documented.  This  mobile  phone-based  banking  model  has  also  been  successfully \ntransplanted to other markets, such as Afghanistan.  \n\n17  News reports suggest that this risk has increased in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, which have \n\nextensive mobile banking channels, forcing a review of their regulation and monitoring. \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nFurther,  Indian  Post,  with  155,000  outlets,  has  recently  been  awarded  a  payment-\nbanking  license.  Apart  from  their  core  activities,  they  also  provide  financial  services, \nsuch  as  savings  schemes;  issue  cash  certificates,  money  orders,  and  insurance;  and \nsell mutual funds, pension products, and remittance services. With core activities being \naffected  by  competition  from  private  players,  the  post  office  needs  to  reinvent  itself. \nGiven  its  long-standing  reputation  and  deep  network  that  has  served  many  isolated \nareas, the post office is well situated to succeed in its new role. \n\n4.6  Policies \n\nAn  important  instrument  of  financial  inclusion  in  India  has  been  the  priority  sector \nlending targets that mandate that all domestic commercial banks, public or private, lend \n40%  of  their  adjusted  net  bank  credit  or  credit  equivalent  amount  of  their  off-balance \nsheet  exposure  (whichever  is  higher)  to  priority  sectors.  For  foreign  banks  with  more \nthan 20 branches, the corresponding figure is 32%. Further, public sector banks have \nclearly  defined  rules  in  the  subcategories  of  agriculture,  MSMEs,  education,  housing, \nand  export  credit.  For  example,  45%  of  all  priority  sector  lending  must  be  made  to \nagriculture.18 However,  the  economic  objectives  that  underlie  priority  sector  lending, \nalthough  laudable,  must  be  reinforced  by  robust  implementation,  including  careful \nmonitoring of distribution (Ramakumar and Chavan 2014). It is widely believed that the \nquality  of  execution  has  been  weak;  in  many  cases,  the  institutions  have  had  to  be \nrecapitalized or amalgamated (MOF 2015b).  \n\nAnother  critical  issue  relates  to  interest  rate  regulation.  The  charge  on  all  loans  is \ncurrently  linked  to  banks\u2019  base  rate,  except  on  farm  loans,  which  is  capped  at  7%. \nBanks  receive  an  interest  subvention  from  the  government  of  2%,  but  a  uniform  cap \noften means that many loans are priced out of sync with their risk profiles. This needs \nto be removed. Accordingly, in April 2014, RBI removed the price cap of 26% on loans \nadvanced by MFIs, the only lenders eligible to lend through the microfinance channel. \nThe rate at which MFIs now advance loans is the lower of the margin spread over the \ncost of funds or the average base rate of the five largest commercial banks by assets \nmultiplied by 2.75 (Vishwanathan 2014). This inclusion agenda can succeed in the long \nterm  only  if  banks  view  it  as  a  viable  business  model.  They  also  must  be  allowed  to \nprice risk freely.  \n\nInterest rates, on the other hand, can be brought down on a sustainable, commercially \nviable  basis  through  greater  competition  in  the  system,  as  shown  by  international \nexperience.  The  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poor  examined  the  experience  of \n30 countries and found that interest rate ceilings impeded the penetration of microcredit \n(Helms and Reille 2004). \n\nThe  stability  of  the  new financial  system  depends  on the  ability  to gauge  and monitor \nthe  risk  associated  with  borrowers.  It  is  imperative  to  link  all  transactions,  but \nparticularly  for  small  loans  like  self-help  group  loans  or  kisan  (i.e.,  small  farmer)  \ncredit  cards to credit  bureaus.  At  a  broader  level,  a  data-sharing  arrangement  among \ntelecommunications  operators,  electric  utilities,  and  credit  bureaus  can  provide  a \ndetailed risk matrix for the economy. \n\nProportionality in regulation is also vital, that is, a policy and regulatory framework that \nis proportionate with the risks and benefits involved. A proportionate approach requires \nthe regulator to understand the risks presented by a specific type of institution, activity, \nproduct,  or  service;  and  to  design  regulation  and  supervision  so  the  costs  to  the \n                                                \n18  According  to  latest  figures  from  the  Central  Statistical  Office,  agriculture  constitutes  14%  of  GDP  and \n\nsupports over 48% of livelihoods in India.  \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nregulator,  institutions,  and  consumers  are  proportionate  to  the  risks  being  addressed, \ntaking  into  consideration  the  anticipated  benefits  as  well.  A  proportionate  approach  is \ncritical to avoiding overly burdensome regulation and supervision that may inhibit new \nentrants  and  innovations,  including  those  that  could  beneficially  serve  people  who \ncurrently do not have access to financial services (Lauer and Tarazi 2012). \n\n4.7  Suitability and Financial Literacy \n\nAnother  goal  that  the  Mor  Committee  emphasized  is  the  right  to  suitability.  Suitability \nmeans that every customer (e.g., a household or a small firm) has the right to be sold a \nsuitable  product  in  keeping  with  the  risk  and  income  profile.  This  right,  not  to  be \n\u201cmissold\u201d a financial service by a financial institution, is the most difficult to implement.  \n\nThe  new  customer  protection  rules  of  the  Financial  Sector  Legislation  Regulation \nReforms Commission stipulate clearly defined processes for monitoring suitability and \npenal action for violation. Both the commission and the Mor Committee recommended \nthe  creation  of  a  unified  financial  redress  agency  for  customer  grievance  redress \nacross  all  financial  products  and  services,  which  will,  in  turn,  coordinate  with  the \nrespective regulator.  \n\nMore  stringent  customer  protection  laws  alone  are  unlikely  to  achieve  financial \ninclusion.  This  must  be  complemented  by  a  significant  increase  in  financial  literacy. 19  \nIn  2013,  India  ranked  the  lowest  in  financial  literacy  among  16  countries  in  the  \nAsia-Pacific  region,  based  on  a  survey  of  7,756  respondents  aged  16\u201364  years \n(MasterCard 2015). To help improve financial literacy, some banks have set up literacy \ncenters  that  work  with  microfinance  organizations.  The  Citi  Center  for  Financial \nLiteracy,  in  Ahmedabad,  has  an  outreach  of  500,000  stakeholders,  a  significant \nnumber  for  an  individual  bank  but  tiny  in  relation  to  the  entire  population  of  the \nunderbanked.  RBI  has  also  launched  a  financial  literacy  project  among  the  target \ngroups  of  schoolchildren,  senior  citizens,  and  military  personnel.  In  its  school-level \ninitiative, RBI personnel use an interactive module to teach the fundamental concepts \nof  financial  literacy.  It  has  also  been  suggested  that  financial  literacy  be  included  in  \nthe  school  curriculum.  Stand-alone  financial  literacy  drives,  similar  to  many  other \nawareness campaigns, are likely to have only limited success.  \n\nfinancial \n\nThe  extensive  penetration  of  mobile  telephones  makes  them  a  potent  platform  for \nthat  games  and \nliteracy.  Media  experts  have  suggested \npromoting \ncompetitions  built  around  a  financial  literacy  theme  can  be  disseminated  through  \nthe  telecommunications  network.  Financial  literacy  modules  can  also  be  shown  \nalong  with  television  programs  and  films;  for  this  objective,  rural  India  has  many \ntraveling cinemas.  \n\n5.  MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES \n\nIt  is  well  recognized  that  MSMEs 20 are  large  contributors  to  the  national  GDP  and \nprovide meaningful employment to over 100 million workers (MMSME 2014). It is also \nwell established that the credit needs of these enterprises have been largely ignored by \n                                                \n19  The concept of financial literacy must encompass understanding of both financial products and services, \nas well as the basic and advanced operations of the banking system. For instance, customers in rural \nareas are not well equipped to deal with advanced biometric systems. In fact, most of them do not even \npossess the basic knowledge of opening a deposit account.  \n\n20  Development  Commissioner,  Ministry  of  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises,  Government  of  India. \nWhat Are Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises? http://www.dcmsme.gov.in/ssiindia/defination_msme.htm \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nthe  formal  financial  system.  The  sector  employs  an  estimated  59.7  million  persons \nspread over 26.1 million enterprises. In terms of value, it accounts for about 45% of the \nmanufacturing  output  and  around  40%  of  the  total  export  of  the  country,  next  only  to \nthe agriculture sector. The survey showed that only 5.18% of the units (both registered \nand unregistered) received finance from institutional sources, 2.05% had finance from \nnoninstitutional  sources,  and  the  majority  (92.77%)  had  no  finance  or  depended  on \nself-finance. This has also partly to do with inadequate penetration of banking facilities \nin  the  remote  areas  that  RBI  is  encouraging  banks  to  bridge  through  structured \nfinancial inclusion plans. Alternative sources of finance, such as risk or venture capital, \nare scarce; thus, these enterprises have to fall back on debt from informal institutional \nsources, often at extremely high interest rates.  \n\nFigure 2: Financial Exclusion in the Micro, Small,  \nand Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector \n(%) \n\nSource: Chakrabarty (2013) \n\n \n\nThe  survey  also  revealed  that  the  few  who  borrow  from  banks  do  so  at  prohibitively \nhigh costs, 13%\u201315%. The lack of formal finance for these units is often driven by the \nperception that they constitute poor-quality credit and that their loan impairment ratio is \nhigh (Chakrabarty 2013). However, adjusting for write-offs and restructuring, micro and \nsmall enterprises actually fare better than their larger counterparts (Table 10).  \n\nTable 10: Impaired Assets Ratio  \n(%) \n\nSegment \n\nMicro and Small \nMedium and Large \n\nMarch 2009  March 2010  March 2011  March 2012  March 2013 \n9.4 \n8 \n\n10.6 \n9.4 \n\n10.6 \n14.8 \n\n9.7 \n11.2 \n\n10.7 \n7.8 \n\nImpaired  assets  ratio  =  (gross  nonperforming  assets  +  restructured  standard  advances  +  cumulative  write-off)  to  \n(total advances + cumulative write-off.)  \n\nSource: Chakrabarty (2013).  \n\nSome  of  the  constraints  faced  by  MSMEs  will  be  met  by  the  greater  penetration  of \nbanking  itself  either  through  physical  branches,  information  and  communications \ntechnology-based  branches,  or  business  correspondents.  These,  however,  must  be \ncombined  with  aggregate  credit  targets  specified  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Task  Force  \non  MSMEs  that  stipulated  20%  credit  growth  to  micro  and  small  enterprises  on  a  \nyear-on-year basis. Banks have also been directed to follow a cluster-based approach \nto MSMEs to ensure that banks develop specialized industry expertise in their lending \nwhile reducing their transaction costs (GOI 2010). RBI has also directed banks to open \nmore specialized branches for MSMEs and to simplify credit approval processes.  \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nThere is also a serious dearth of equity capital, a major impediment for first-generation \nentrepreneurs  who  need  equity  financing  for  start-up  ventures.  This  has  been  partly \naddressed  by  the  dedicated  platforms  set  up  for  MSMEs  by  the  National  Stock \nExchange  of  India  and  Bombay  Stock  Exchange.  Listings  on  these  two  exchanges \nhave  started  to  increase  since  mid-2013.  The  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  platform  has  \n90 firms listed on it, but the listings on the National Stock Exchange of India have been \nmuch lower. Indeed, the numbers of firms operating on both exchanges are small given \nthe size of the sector.21 \n\nMSMEs  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  considerable  delay  in  settlement  of  dues  \nand  payment  of  bills  by  large-scale  buyers.  This  has  to  be  institutionally  tackled  by \nfactoring, and banks should provide such services, particularly to MSMEs. To facilitate \nfactoring services, the government passed the Factoring Regulation Act in 2011, which \naddresses  delays  in  payment  and  liquidity  problems  of  MSMEs.  Factoring  provides \nliquidity to MSMEs against their receivables from customers, and is regarded as a cash \nmanagement  tool.  Factors  are  entitled  to  take  legal  recourse  for  recovering  assigned \ndebt  and  receivables  from  buyers  of  goods  and  services.  Despite  the  institution  of  \na  legal  framework,  factoring  is  yet  to  take  off  in  a  significant  manner,  due  to  lack  of \ncredit insurance, lack of clarity on stamp duty waivers by states, and lack of access to  \ndebt-recovery platforms. All of these issues need to be resolved as part of the financial \ninclusion initiative. \n\nBanks also have a vital role to play in nurturing the sector, and this cannot cease with \nthe  provision  of  credit.  Banks  and  other  financial  institutions  must  view  themselves  \nnot  just  as  providers  of  credit  but  as  partners  in  the  growth  of  these  enterprises,  by \naiding  first-generation  entrepreneurs.  Typically,  MSMEs  operate  with  low  productivity  \nof  capital  and  have  either  too  little  or  too  much cash. The  tools for  this work  are fully \ndeveloped  (e.g.,  cash-flow  forecasts  and  cash-flow  management).  The  financial \nmanagement  needs  of  MSMEs  are  predictable,  and  banks,  by  providing  these \nservices,  can  reap  enormous  rewards  in  terms  of  fee-income,  enhancing  business \nvolumes, and boosting the credit quality of these firms.  \n\nSpeedy  disbursal  of  loans  to  MSMEs  is  contingent  on  the  efficiency  of  the  \nappraisal  process.  An  important  dimension  to  efficiency  in  the  context  of  lending \ndecisions  is  the  speed  with  which  any  individual  lending  decision  is  taken.  Efficiency  \nis  improved  by  better  evaluation  of future  payment  performance,  so that the  lender  is \nable  to  choose  whom  to  accept.  RBI  recommended  that  a  credit-scoring  approach \ntypical  for  large-volume  consumer  loans  be  used,  instead  of  a  more  elaborate  \ncredit-rating approach.  \n\nThe  newly  formed  MUDRA  Bank  has  a  key  role  in  catalyzing  fund  flows  to  MSMEs. \nMUDRA  Bank  aims  to  meet  the  credit  needs  of  the  unfunded  categories,  broadly \ndefined  as  self-employed  or  own-account  enterprises.  Borrowers  in  these  MSMEs \ngenerally  lack  standardized  documents  and  do  not  have  the  collateral  that  formal \nsector  financial  institutions  seek.  This  market  segment  is  large,  almost  entirely  in  the \nunorganized  sector,  and  vulnerable  to  a  range  of  economic  shocks.  The  primary \npurpose  of  the  bank  is  refinancing  for  lending  to  MSMEs.  It  is  also  envisaged  to \nperform regulatory functions for all types of entities in the microfinance space.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n21  Issue sizes on the exchanges have ranged from Rs50 million to Rs250 million. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nExperience  in  India  has  shown  that  incorporating  regulation  and  financing  functions \nwithin a single institution can be challenging. As RBI currently oversees the activities of \nMFIs, dual oversight and the attendant risk of regulatory arbitrage are a possibility. In \nthe  aftermath  of  the  2010  crisis,  RBI  facilitated  the  development  of  a  well-articulated \nframework  for  governance,  including  a  revival  of  investor  confidence.  At  present,  \nMFIs  that  represent  over  90%  of  the  microfinance  industry  are  supervised  by  the \ncentral bank.  \n\n6.  CONCLUSION \n\nTo address the market failure to provide financial services to low-income clients, India \nhas a huge opportunity. For the first time in the last decade, financial inclusion is at the \nheart  of  the  policy  agenda,  and  it  has  been  widened  to  include  savings,  credit, \ninsurance,  and  pensions.  Technology  increasingly  affords  the  opportunity  to  improve \ndelivery; in particular, there are technologies that enable better targeting and transfer of \nfinancial resources to households.  \n\nfavorable  conditions \n\nIndia  has  several  strategic  assets  providing \n\nToday, \nfor  \nchange-leveraging technology. A strong banking network of 115,000 branches linked to \nekuber (i.e., RBI's core banking solution) is spreading into rural areas that lack banks. \nIndian  Post,  with  155,000  outlets,  has  a  payment-banking  license,  and  point-of-sale \nnetworks  and  ATMs  facilitate  cash  transactions  across  the  country.  India\u2019s  vibrant \nnetwork  of  almost  1  billion  mobile  connections,  covering  75%  of  the  population,  can \nfacilitate  the  spread  of  banking  services  through  the  business  correspondent  model \nand  also  enable  funds  transfer  over  mobile  phones.  Moreover,  Aadhaar,  the  national \nidentification  system  that  seeks  to  cover  the  entire  population  by  2016,  can  provide \nbackend verification and the security architecture.  \n\nMFIs  have  also  emerged  as  important  players  in  the  inclusion  space,  successfully \nrevitalized after the 2010 crisis due to regulatory intervention and candid introspection \nfollowing  the  severe  public  censure  (Sane  and  Thomas  2013).  Clients  are  now  \noffered  services  with  clear  communication  of  lending  rates,  tenure  of  loans,  and \nrepayment  flexibility.  Complementing  these  regulatory  directions,  there  have  been \nmany  self-regulatory  initiatives  aimed  at  promoting  responsible  business  practices  in \nthe microfinance  market.  RBI  has  also  raised  its lending  limits for  MFIs that  will  allow \nthem to serve a wider section of borrowers.  \n\nThe  new  architecture  of  inclusion  reflects  the  failure  of  the  traditional  formal  sector  \nand  the  need  to  adopt  modern  methods  to  serve  the  poor.  In  this  context,  regulation \nhas  a  fundamental  role  to  play  in  ensuring  that  market-oriented  solutions  to  \npoverty  alleviation  coexist  with  other  social  initiatives.  India\u2019s  financial  inclusion  \nagenda  has  seen  a  welcome  shift  away  from  an  emphasis  on  credit  to  a  more \ncomprehensive approach.  \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 568 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nBarua, Kathuria, and Malik \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB). 2000.

This \npaper describes the structure of banking and microfinance institutions in India relevant to the \ndeveloping model of financial inclusion, as well as relevant regulatory structure and modes \nof delivery. It explains the current state of financial inclusion, as well as regulatory changes \nnecessary to make the new architecture for inclusion viable, including a critique of some of \nthe recommendations of the Mor Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small \nBusinesses  and  Low-Income  Households.  The  paper  then  reviews  modes  of  delivery  and \nthe regulatory structure being contemplated or recently introduced. It assesses the suitability \nobjective  envisaged  as  critical  for  inclusion,  associated  challenge  of  revamping  consumer \nprotection laws, and imperative of improving financial literacy. The paper also discusses the \ncase of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in the given context. \n \nJEL Classification: G21, G28, L53, O16 \n", " \n"]}
