INTRODUCTION: THE PARADIGN SHIFT IN THE \nCONCEPT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION \nAmong economists, the general consensus is that financial development acts as a \ncatalyst in the overall growth and development of an economy. Moreover, empirical \nresearch  demonstrates  that  development  of  a  strong,  sound  financial  system \ncontributes  to  economic  growth  (Rajan  and  Zingales  2003).  As  a  result,  most \ndeveloping country governments are promoting financial inclusion1 as a policy goal, \nespecially for those who are ignored by formal sector institutions.  \nIn India, financial inclusion has always been a priority, given the country\u2019s socialist \nbeginnings. Since 1969, when banks were nationalized, the strategy for addressing the \nbanking needs of the poor has been biased toward providing credit, neglecting other \naspects, such as building a deposit base, promoting a savings culture, or extending the \npayment  network.  This  credit  drive  was  implemented  in  two  ways:  (i)  directing  a \nsignificant fraction of credit directly to credit-starved poor households and micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through priority sector targets for banks; and \n(ii) creating specialized entities, such as regional rural banks and cooperative banks. \nThis policy has met with limited success, as banks find it difficult to reach the intended \nbeneficiaries,  instead  meeting  their  priority  sector  targets  by  lending  to  other \nintermediaries, such as microfinance institutions (MFIs) that have emerged largely due \nto the failure of banks to promote financial inclusion.  \nHowever, over the last decade, India\u2019s financial inclusion agenda has seen a paradigm \nshift from an emphasis on credit to a more comprehensive approach toward financial \nservices, particularly opening bank accounts and offering basic financial products such \nas insurance. This shift has been partly driven by the need to achieve other public \npolicy goals, such as replacing product subsidies with cash transfers, which requires \nbeneficiaries to have bank accounts for expediting the transfers. The concern regarding \ngrowing macroeconomic imbalances, such as a fall in the rate of financial savings that \npartly reflects a lack of adequate penetration of bank branches, has also been a driver. \nThis  new  approach  necessitates  a  change  in  the  financial  architecture  of  India\u2019s \neconomy. Since bank account creation is an integral part of the agenda, banks must  \nbe more directly involved, as regulations mandate deposit taking as their exclusive \ndomain.  Their  efforts  also  need  to  be  supplemented  by  intermediaries,  such  as \nbusiness correspondents. Moreover, access to a robust payment network warrants the \nentry of specialist payment banks. Thus, the new inclusion drive involves multiple \nentities, and further involves MFIs. Yet there is a need for balance: risks, such as \nstability, solvency, anti-money laundering, and combating the financing of terrorism, \nmust be addressed through regulation, while also ensuring that such regulation does \nnot stifle inclusion. \nIt is important to note that financially excluded households and microenterprises must \ndeal  entirely  in  cash  yet  are  susceptible  to  irregular  and  uncertain  cash  flows. \nMoreover, due to lack of access to formal institutions, financially excluded segments \n                                                \n1  In 2008, the Committee on Financial Inclusion defined financial inclusion as \u201cthe process of ensuring \naccess to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as \nweaker sections and low income groups at an affordable cost\u201d (Rangarajan 2008). This definition was \nlater enhanced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI): \u201cfinancial inclusion is the process of ensuring \naccess to appropriate financial products and services needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker \nsections and low income groups at an affordable cost in a fair and transparent manner by mainstream \ninstitutional players\u201d (RBI 2014a).  \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nhave limited options for building assets or saving for their old age. The lack of savings \nand savings avenues forces them to approach informal sources of finance, which often \ncharge 60%\u2013100% in annual interest payments. Exposure to high rates of interest, and \nthe inability to service such loans, ensures that these borrowers remain trapped in \ndebt, exacerbating the cycle of poverty. The new agenda for financial inclusion seeks \nto address both of these long-standing concerns for India. \n2.  STRUCTURE OF THE BANKING AND \nMICROFINANCE INSTITUTION SECTOR IN INDIA \nSoon after independence in 1947, a highly regulated banking system was put into \nplace. Nationalization of the Imperial Bank, as the State Bank of India in 1955, was \nfollowed in 1969 by 14 private sector commercial banks. In 1991, the banking industry \nwas deregulated by allowing entry of new private sector banks and increasing the  \nlimit of foreign equity to 74% in private sector banks. Simultaneously, licensing of \nbranches of domestic-scheduled commercial banks was phased out, and interest rates \nwere deregulated.  \nToday, India\u2019s banking sector is diversified (Table 1), reflecting the banking needs of \nvarious sectors. Besides typical commercial banks, which operate on all-India basis, \nthere  are  small  banks with  limited  areas  of  operation  that  were  set up  to further \nfinancial inclusion and poverty alleviation. Credit cooperatives serve the needs of small \nand marginal farmers as well as the poor in urban and semi-urban areas. Regional \nrural banks were created to bring together the positive features of credit cooperatives \nand commercial banks to address the credit needs of poor rural areas (Gandhi 2015). \nLocal area banks were expected to fortify the institutional credit framework in rural and \nsemi-urban areas.  \nIndeed, India\u2019s banking system has grown rapidly over the years (Table 2). Over the \nlast  decade,  India  has  witnessed  a  credit  boom,  with  the  share  of  credit\u2013gross \ndomestic product (GDP) increasing from 35.5% in 2000 to 51.0% in 2013, the bulk \naccounted for by bank lending (MOF 2015b).2  \nPublic sector banks dominate the landscape, with a market share in total deposits of \naround 74.0%; the share in total advances was 73.2% as of March 2015 (Table 3). Yet \ntheir performance, compared to their private sector counterparts, has been weak. Their \ngross nonperforming loans (NPLs) were 4.36% versus 3.83% for all banks; their total \nstressed assets were 10.67% versus 9.03% for all banks. New private sector banks \nrecorded much lower NPLs of 1.73% and total stressed assets of 3.28%. Of course, \nthere is significant variation in performance across public sector banks (RBI 2013b).  \nA specific challenge confronting banking in India is to resource public sector banks to \novercome the problem of stressed and restructured assets to meet the imminent Basel \nIII requirements of capital adequacy. Recapitalization requirements for public sector \nbanks have been estimated to range from Rs48 trillion ($800 billion) to Rs100 trillion \n($1.6 trillion), depending on the assumptions of forbearance and ratio of restructured \nassets turning into NPLs (RBI 2014c).  \n \n                                                \n2  Empirically, it has been shown that as countries become richer, they tend to see a rise in credit, but the \nshare of the banking sector in total credit shrinks over the course of development relative to other \nsources of funding such as capital markets (MOF 2015b). \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nTable 1: Structure of Banking in India \nNumber of \nType of Bank  Composition  Bank Name  Branches \nCommercial  Public sector banks (26)  State Bank of India   14,699 \nBanks  (72,661 branches)  Associate banks   5,482 \nNationalized banks   52,480 \nOther public sector banks   1 \nPrivate sector banks (20)  Old private sector   6,047 \nNew private sector banks   9,522 \nForeign banks (43)  Branch mode of presence   332 \nRegional rural banks (64)  Limited area of operation    \nLocal area banks (4)  Limited area of operation    \nCooperative  Urban cooperative banks (1,606)  Multistate urban cooperative  43 \nBanks  banks \nSingle state urban  1,563 \ncooperative banks \nRural cooperatives (93,551)  Short term   92,834 \nState cooperative banks  31 \nDistrict central cooperative  371 \nbanks \nPrimary agriculture operative  92,432 \nsocieties \nLong term   717 \nState cooperative agriculture  20 \nand rural development banks \nPrimary cooperative  697 \nagriculture and rural \ndevelopment banks \nMicrofinance  There are 52 microfinance  Arohan, Bandhan, BSS,  10,553 \nInstitutions   institutions that have either  Cashpor, Disha, Equitas, \nreceived or applied for registration  ESAF, Grama Vidiyal  \nfrom the Reserve Bank of India as \nof June 2015.

Most formal \nfinancial institutions are reluctant to serve them and MSMEs because of perceived high \nrisks, high costs involved in small transactions, low relative profitability, and inability to \nprovide the physical collateral usually required by such institutions (IMF 2004). In \ntechnical terms, problems of adverse selection and information asymmetries make it \ndifficult for financial institutions to screen and to monitor credit decisions.  \nTo address this market failure and to provide financial services to low-income clients, \nMFIs emerged, although their character has undergone a shift from the time that they \ncommenced  operations.  The  pioneer  MFIs  operated  as  nonprofit,  nongovernment \norganizations  with  a  strong  social  focus.  They  developed  new  credit  techniques; \ninstead of requiring collateral, they reduced risk through group guarantees, appraisals \nof  household  cash  flow,  and  small  initial  loans  to  test  clients.3 Today,  however,  \nMFIs  have  changed  from  nongovernment  organizations  to  nonbanking  finance \ncompanies (NBFCs), and there has been a modification in how they raise finance. \nOnce primarily donor-led, MFIs are now increasingly funded by banks and private and \nshareholder equity. \nCurrently, the regulated microfinance market in India has over 30 million clients, served \nby  nearly  50  regulated  institutions  with  a  gross  loan  portfolio  of  about  $7  billion, \nreflecting  growth  of  61%  over  2013\u201314  (MicroMeter  2015).  The  10  largest  MFIs \naccount for 75% of the total industry loans. MFIs have a network of 10,553 branches, \nwith 80,097 employees across 32 states and union territories. MFI activity is only set to \ngrow,  especially  because  only  8%  of  adults  have  loans  from  formal  financial \ninstitutions. Only 35% have bank accounts, of which more than half are inactive or \nsemi-active (World Bank 2015). \n3.  STATE OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION \nIndia\u2019s record of financial inclusion, despite the existence of a large and well-regulated \nfinancial system dominated by commercial banks, is poor. Judging by aggregate macro \ndata,  the  household  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  of  8.9%  is  among  the  lowest  in  the  region, \ncontrasted with the People\u2019s Republic of China at 36.8% and Thailand at around \n83.0%.4 The absence of inclusion is especially conspicuous in rural India, home to \naround 60% of the population. In 2013\u201314, deposits per head were only Rs9,244 \n(about $154) in rural areas, with credit about Rs6,000 (about $100) per head (Table 4). \n                                                \n3  Experience has shown that the poor repay uncollateralized loans reliably and are willing to pay the full \ncost of providing them; access is more important to them than cost. \n4  Citi Research \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nThat said, there are sections of the urban population (e.g., migrant labor) who do not \nhave access to the formal financial sector as well. \nTable 4: Per Capita Deposits and Credit in Rural and Urban India \n(Rs) \n   Rural    Urban \nFiscal Year  Deposits  Credit    Deposits  Credit \n2007\u201308  3,735  3,977    85,003  60,405 \n2008\u201309  4,441  3,779    100,146  71,437 \n2009\u201310  5,088  4,662    113,747  81,313 \n2010\u201311  5,924  4,713    131,303  98,772 \n2011\u201312  6,830  5,269    144,138  114,185 \n2012\u201313  7,923  6,197    162,145  127,854 \n2013\u201314  9,244  6,161    178,942  143,718 \nSource: Author estimates based on the data from RBI.

In 2009, the government mandated that the transfer of wages under the \nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) be made \ndirectly to the bank accounts of the workers. The objective was twofold: to reduce \nleakages, and to widen the access to basic banking services.5 However, the number of \nloans with commercial banks remains low, indicating that most of these accounts are \nused merely for receiving wages. \nAnother survey conducted by the World Bank captured how adults save, borrow, make \npayments,  and  manage  risk  (Table  8).

A recent \ninitiative toward these goals has been the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), \nan ambitious plan that seeks to cover each household in India with a bank account.6 \nOver 190 million Jan Dhan accounts were operational in October 2015.7 In fact, on the \nfirst day of the program, 15 million bank accounts were opened. Account holders are \ngiven a debit and a credit card, while microinsurance is likely to be added later.

In April 2005, it recognized that vast \nsections of the population did not have access to banking services due to minimum \nbalance requirements. To achieve greater access, RBI counseled banks to open basic \nbanking or \u201cno-frills\u201d accounts with no or very low minimum balances and no or minimal \ncharges. Conceding the stigma associated with the nomenclature \u201cno-frills,\u201d banks \nwere advised to offer a \u201cbasic savings bank deposit account\u201d (BSBDA) with simplified \nknow-your-customer norms.8  \nUntil March 2014, 243 million BSBDAs were on the books of banks, but the increase in \nthe number of accounts is not reflected in a corresponding increase in the number of \ntransactions (RBI 2014a). Table 9 shows that outstanding deposits in BSBDAs were \nonly Rs312.3 billion, while overdraft used in these accounts was only Rs16.0 billion. \nMoreover,  most  of  the  MNREGA  accounts  are  only  used  to  receive  wages; \nbeneficiaries withdraw their money immediately after it is deposited, leaving very low \nbalances in these accounts (RBI 2014a). Even in the PMJDY Jan Dhan accounts, \nmany new bank accounts remain dormant, resulting in costs for banks and limited gain \nto the beneficiaries. According to one estimate, 80% of accounts opened do not have \ntransactions, revealing that the account holders are still not really financially included \n(Patel 2014). \nTable 9: Banking Penetration Progress, 2010\u20132014 \n  FY 2010  FY 2011  FY 2012  FY 2013  FY 2014 \nBanking outlets in villages           \nBranches  33,378  34,811  37,471  40,837  46,126 \nBusiness correspondents  34,174  80,802  141,136  221,341  337,678 \nOther modes  142  595  3,146  6,276   \nTotal  67,674  116,208  181,753  268,454  383,804 \nUrban locations through business  447  3,771  5,891  27,143  60,730 \ncorrespondents \nBasic savings bank deposit account           \nbranches \nNo. in millions  60.19  73.13  81.20  100.80  126.00 \nAmount in Rs billion  44.33  57.89  109.87  164.69  273.30 \nBasic savings bank deposit account           \nbusiness correspondents \nNo. in millions  13.27  31.63  57.30  81.27  116.90 \nAmount in Rs billion  10.69  18.23  10.54  18.22  39.00 \nOverdraft availed in basic savings            \nbank deposit accounts \nNo. in millions  0.18  0.61  2.71  3.92  5.90 \nAmount in Rs billion  0.10  0.26  1.08  1.55  16.00 \nKisan credit cards  24.31  27.11  30.24  33.79  39.90 \n(No. in millions) \nSource: RBI 2014. \n                                                \n8  There are three basic requirement for BSBDAs: (i) all credits in a financial year cannot exceed \nRs100,000; (ii) withdrawals and transfers per month cannot exceed Rs10,000; and (iii) balances at any \npoint cannot exceed Rs50,000. \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nThe inference is that bundling of government welfare payments into BSBDAs through \ndirect cash transfers is only necessary for ensuring that the accounts are used.

DELIVERY MODELS, REGULATIONS, AND OTHER \nISSUES \n4.1  The Mor Committee \nA comprehensive blueprint for the architecture of inclusion was created by the Mor \nCommittee  on  Comprehensive  Financial  Services  for  Small  Businesses  and  \nLow-Income  Households  in  2014.  This  committee  proposed  the  following  to  be \nachieved by 1 January 2016: (i) provision to each resident over age 18 years of an \nindividual, full-service electronic bank account; (ii) establishment of widely distributed \nelectronic  payment  access  points,  offering  deposit  and  withdrawal  facilities  at \nreasonable cost; (iii) provision to each low-income household of convenient access to \nformally regulated providers that can provide suitable credit products, investment and \ndeposit products, and insurance and risk management products at reasonable prices; \nand (iv) provision to every customer of the legally protected right to be offered suitable \nfinancial services.  \nOne criticism of the recommendations was that the targets and timelines set by the \ncommittee  were  aggressive.  RBI  identified  490,000  villages,  and  allotted  them  to \nvarious banks for coverage by 2016. This entailed that these banks open 80,000 \nadditional rural branches during 2013\u20132016. Only 7,459 rural branches were, however, \nopened. The committee\u2019s recommendations were also skewed toward payments and \ndeposit creation, and inadequate in ensuring improved credit delivery or risk products \nto the poor.  \nFigure 1: Present Financial Architecture and Banking System Design \n \nThe  Mor  Committee  did  recognize  that  an  optimally  designed  banking  system for  \nIndia  must  involve  a  mix  of  horizontally  differentiated  and  vertically  differentiated \nbanking systems (Figure 1). Banking systems across the world are based on these  \ntwo designs: (i) horizontally differentiated, in which the basic design element remains a \nfull-service bank that combines the three building blocks of payments, deposits, and \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \ncredit but is differentiated primarily on size, geography, or sector; and (ii) vertically \ndifferentiated, in which the full-service bank is replaced by banks that specialize in one \nor more of the building blocks of payments, deposits, and credit (i.e., a functional \ndesign configuration).  \n4.2  Small Banks \nGlobally, small banks have been seen as a crucial link in the process of financial \ninclusion. This belief has led to the creation of a range of structures in India\u2019s financial \nsystem, such as regional rural banks, united community banks, and local area banks. \nThese are locally governed and funded out of the local deposit base. As per RBI data, \nas of 2012\u201313, the total number of regional rural bank offices stood above 17,000, with \nabout 75% located in rural areas. They were created in the mid-1970s and 1980s \nlargely  on  the  back  of  regulatory  advantage  of  lower  capital  adequacy  norms  as \nsubsidiaries of sponsor commercial banks. Yet by the end of 1990s, most turned out to \nbe unviable. The number of regional rural banks has dwindled from 196 to 62 over the \nyears (Subbarao 2013). Further, only four of six local area banks in India, licensed by \nRBI, are functioning, with the rest shut down primarily due to mismanagement.  \nGlobal evidence regarding the performance of small banks is mixed. Small banks in \ndeveloping countries (e.g., Ghana and Nigeria) have solvency problems. The United \nStates model is also beginning to develop cracks, mainly due to the failure of such \nbanks  to  keep  pace  with  the  advancement  in  banking  technology  (RBI  2014b). \nRegional banks in Germany and Switzerland, on the other hand, are backed by an \neffective risk management structure and have thus been able to survive.  \nAlthough small banks do possess certain benefits in the form of low-cost, customized \nservices per local needs and near absence of contagion effects, they are vulnerable to \ncapture and concentration risk, owing to localization of their operations and political \ninfluence (RBI 2014b). There are other risks of commodity price volatility and weather \nvagaries, which create the need for a high capital adequacy ratio. Moreover, small \nbanks cannot experience economies of scale, as they are expected to operate within \nspecified limits. They also lack the capacity to finance big projects.   \nSmallness or localization does not present a strong case for their creation based on \nregulatory forbearance. The licensing of new banks should instead be driven by the \nlevel playing field principle, and if a local NBFC or other candidate for a license has the \nfinancial strength or eligibility, it should be given a license. Indeed, 8 of the 10 entities \ngranted a license for small finance banks by RBI recently are MFIs.9 The key reason to \nconvert into a small finance bank is access to deposits; they will also be able to offer a \nwider range of loan products to customers. The converted companies must follow the \npricing structure of banks, which is linked to their base rate.   \n4.3  Microfinance Institutions \nMFIs who did not receive a small bank license or did not apply also remain integral to \nthe objective of inclusion. After a turbulent year in 2010, the microfinance industry in \nIndia has undergone some significant changes in regulations and operations.10 The \ncrisis of 2010 stemmed from extremely high and often usurious interest rates, coercive \n                                                \n9  Disha Microfin, Equitas Holdings, ESAF Microfinance and Investments, Janalakshmi Financial Services, \nRGVN (North East) Microfinance, Suryoday Micro Finance, Ujjivan Financial Services, and Utkarsh \nMicro Finance. RBI (2015).  \n10 See Shylendra (2006) for an account of the crisis.  \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \ndebt  collection  practices,  and  multiple  lending.  All  three  problems  related  to  the \ninterface between the borrower and MFI. In 2011, RBI mandated clear communication \nof  lending  rates,  tenure  of  loans,  repayment  flexibility,  and  the  need  to  create  a \ncustomer redress mechanism. MFIs have retained their priority sector lending status, \nwhile RBI has recently introduced self-regulatory initiatives such as the Industry Code \nof Conduct and development of a credit bureau toward responsible microfinance.  \nThe  industry  bodies  of  MFIs,  the  MicroFinance  Institutions  Network  (MFIN)  and  \nSa-Dhan, are now recognized as self-regulated organizations by the central bank.11 It \nis not yet clear if they will report to RBI or the newly created Micro Units Development \nand Refinance Agency (MUDRA) Bank. 12 Self-regulation is tricky and does not imply \ndiscretionary regulation; it is simply a model of regulatory outsourcing that obliges the \norganization to monitor members and to ensure compliance with the extant regulations \nof the central bank, including responsible lending. Self-regulated organizations are \nrequired to formulate  a  code of  conduct  and have  an  effective grievance  redress \nsystem for borrowers and a dispute resolution structure for members. In the current \nframework, MFIs can report to Sa-Dhan or MFIN, which is not necessarily good for \nregulatory efficiency. Moreover, such competition could result in regulatory arbitrage, \nsince, in practice, some MFIs could be members of both Sa-Dhan and MFIN.13  \nAn area where self-regulated organizations could be immediately effective is in aligning \ninterest charges of members with their costs. This would lead to price differentials \nacross NBFCs that would both exert downward pressure on interest charges and lead \nto greater operating efficiency in the system. While the more efficient may see a \ntemporary  drop  in  margins,  it  would  benefit  them  in  the  long  term.  Less-efficient \ncompanies would see a loss in business volume, while the fitter should see their losses \nin margins offset by a rise in volume. \n4.4  Business Correspondents \nAnother significant regulatory change toward financial inclusion has been the relaxing \nof norms for business correspondents or bank mitras (i.e., agents of the bank) to \ncomplement  the  classical  approach  of  physical  branch-led  distribution.  Business \ncorrespondents  provide  last-mile  connectivity  for  financial  services  in  remote  and \nunderbanked locations. While initially restrictive in the kind of players who can qualify \nas business correspondents, the norm has been significantly eased, as it is now open \nto profit-making entities.  \nBusiness  correspondents  are  microbankers  who  are  outside  of  the  purview  of \nregulators. They are \u201cprotected\u201d by the capital of a sponsor bank, but since they do not \nprovide any capital themselves, the moral hazard of risky lending becomes a distinct \npossibility. Banks in Brazil and India have been uncomfortable with allowing business \n                                                \n11 In  March  2015,  Sa-Dhan, an  association  of  MFIs,  was  accorded  the status  of a  self-regulatory \norganization, which gave it powers to monitor MFIs and to ensure the lenders are in compliance with \nrules. Sa-Dhan is the second association to be given this status by the central bank; MFIN was given \nthat status in 2014.  \n12 MUDRA Bank was launched on 8 April 2015 to provide formal or institutional financial support to the \nnoncorporate small business sector. The bank with an initial corpus of $3.5 billion is charged to provide \naccess of formal systems of credit to the \u201cbottom-of-the-pyramid\u201d entrepreneurs, popularly known as the \n\u201cmissing middle.\u201d  \n13 Since the model for the sector is new, however, it is too early to comment on the utility. It takes time for \ninstitutions to establish the desirable characteristics of independence and credibility; the test lies in \nactual behavior of the institution when faced with difficult decisions that involve substantial interest \ngroup conflict (Melody 1997).  \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \ncorrespondents to lend. There has been some effort to overcome this moral hazard \nproblem, allowing business correspondents to hold capital against the loans that they \nsanction.14 Given that financial viability remains an issue, it is still a question whether \nthe business correspondent model can be scaled.  \n4.5  Payment System \nA  policy  in  India  encouraging  large financial  institutions  to  customize  products for  \nlow-income customers enjoyed only moderate success, triggering a review by RBI  \nthat led to the creation of new regulatory financial and architecture.15 In 2015, RBI \ngranted  approval  to  set  up  11  payment  banks  and  10  small  finance  banks  (RBI  \n2015). Payment banks are permitted to accept demand deposits (i.e., current deposits) \nand  savings  bank  deposits  from  individuals,  small  businesses,  and  other  entities.  \nThey  are  restricted  to  holding  a  maximum  balance  of  Rs100,000  per  individual \ncustomer, and they cannot issue credit cards or undertake lending activities. Payment \nbanks are permitted to set up outlets such as branches and ATMs, and to appoint \nbusiness correspondents. Small finance banks will undertake basic banking activities, \nsuch as acceptance of deposits and lending to unserved and underserved sections, \nincluding small business units, small and marginal farmers, MSMEs, and unorganized \nsector entities.  \nA large informal sector and a vast pool of migrant workers means that a sizeable \nfraction of transactions in India, estimated at 65%, occur in cash (RBI 2009). Informal \nchannels  for  cash  transfers  exist  but  are  expensive  and  inefficient  compared  to \nelectronic methods. Thus, a critical aim of the inclusion agenda is the provision of a \nrobust payment system that minimizes the use of cash. This involves the convergence \nof banking, digitization, and mobile phones as invoked in the JAM Number Trinity \nsolution (i.e., Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar cards, and mobile numbers) proposed in  \nthe  Economic  Survey  2014\u201315  that  allows  the  state  to transfer  subsidies  to  poor \nhouseholds in a targeted manner.  \nWhile enhancing payment efficiency is the principal objective, products such as digital \nwallets can also function as savings instruments earning interest.16 Yet although most \nscheduled commercial banks have the credentials and balance sheet strength to offer \nmobile-based financial products, the key question relates to the desirability of entry of \nnonbank participants into this space. Currently, 27 private participants (i.e., pre-paid \ninstrument providers) are allowed to offer digital wallets up to Rs50,000 that must be \nbacked by escrow deposits placed with a commercial bank. While expansion of this \nprivate network will help inclusion, there are potential risks. For any money transfer \nscheme, customer authentication becomes critical.17 There is merit in converting pre-\npaid instrument providers to payment banks, as RBI has recently done, as mobile \nwallets gain the status of deposits and earn returns (RBI 2009). \n                                                \n14 ICICI Bank in 2005\u201306 successfully experimented with the concept of a credit franchisee, who is similar \nto a business correspondent or facilitator but was required to place a fixed deposit with the bank of 10% \nof the amount of loans that he or she would sanction. Upon default, the deposit would function as a first \nloss deficiency guarantee. \n15  For a brief analytic discussion, see NCAER (2011)  \n16 The success of mobile wallets and fully digital banking in African economies (e.g., the M-PESA model in \nKenya) is well documented. This mobile phone-based banking model has also been successfully \ntransplanted to other markets, such as Afghanistan.  \n17 News reports suggest that this risk has increased in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, which have \nextensive mobile banking channels, forcing a review of their regulation and monitoring. \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nFurther, Indian Post, with 155,000 outlets, has recently been awarded a payment-\nbanking license. Apart from their core activities, they also provide financial services, \nsuch as savings schemes; issue cash certificates, money orders, and insurance; and \nsell mutual funds, pension products, and remittance services. With core activities being \naffected by competition from private players, the post office needs to reinvent itself. \nGiven its long-standing reputation and deep network that has served many isolated \nareas, the post office is well situated to succeed in its new role. \n4.6  Policies \nAn important instrument of financial inclusion in India has been the priority sector \nlending targets that mandate that all domestic commercial banks, public or private, lend \n40% of their adjusted net bank credit or credit equivalent amount of their off-balance \nsheet exposure (whichever is higher) to priority sectors. For foreign banks with more \nthan 20 branches, the corresponding figure is 32%. Further, public sector banks have \nclearly defined rules in the subcategories of agriculture, MSMEs, education, housing, \nand export credit. For example, 45% of all priority sector lending must be made to \nagriculture.18 However, the economic objectives that underlie priority sector lending, \nalthough  laudable,  must  be  reinforced  by  robust  implementation,  including  careful \nmonitoring of distribution (Ramakumar and Chavan 2014). It is widely believed that the \nquality of execution has been weak; in many cases, the institutions have had to be \nrecapitalized or amalgamated (MOF 2015b).  \nAnother critical issue relates to interest rate regulation. The charge on all loans is \ncurrently linked to banks\u2019 base rate, except on farm loans, which is capped at 7%. \nBanks receive an interest subvention from the government of 2%, but a uniform cap \noften means that many loans are priced out of sync with their risk profiles. This needs \nto be removed. Accordingly, in April 2014, RBI removed the price cap of 26% on loans \nadvanced by MFIs, the only lenders eligible to lend through the microfinance channel. \nThe rate at which MFIs now advance loans is the lower of the margin spread over the \ncost of funds or the average base rate of the five largest commercial banks by assets \nmultiplied by 2.75 (Vishwanathan 2014). This inclusion agenda can succeed in the long \nterm only if banks view it as a viable business model. They also must be allowed to \nprice risk freely.  \nInterest rates, on the other hand, can be brought down on a sustainable, commercially \nviable basis through greater competition in the system, as shown by international \nexperience. The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor examined the experience of \n30 countries and found that interest rate ceilings impeded the penetration of microcredit \n(Helms and Reille 2004). \nThe stability of the new financial system depends on the ability to gauge and monitor \nthe  risk  associated  with  borrowers.  It  is  imperative  to  link  all  transactions,  but \nparticularly  for  small  loans  like  self-help  group  loans  or  kisan  (i.e.,  small  farmer)  \ncredit cards to credit bureaus. At a broader level, a data-sharing arrangement among \ntelecommunications  operators,  electric  utilities,  and  credit  bureaus  can  provide  a \ndetailed risk matrix for the economy. \nProportionality in regulation is also vital, that is, a policy and regulatory framework that \nis proportionate with the risks and benefits involved. A proportionate approach requires \nthe regulator to understand the risks presented by a specific type of institution, activity, \nproduct,  or service;  and  to  design regulation and  supervision  so the  costs to the \n                                                \n18 According to latest figures from the Central Statistical Office, agriculture constitutes 14% of GDP and \nsupports over 48% of livelihoods in India.  \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nregulator, institutions, and consumers are proportionate to the risks being addressed, \ntaking into consideration the anticipated benefits as well. A proportionate approach is \ncritical to avoiding overly burdensome regulation and supervision that may inhibit new \nentrants and innovations, including those that could beneficially serve people who \ncurrently do not have access to financial services (Lauer and Tarazi 2012). \n4.7  Suitability and Financial Literacy \nAnother goal that the Mor Committee emphasized is the right to suitability. Suitability \nmeans that every customer (e.g., a household or a small firm) has the right to be sold a \nsuitable product in keeping with the risk and income profile. This right, not to be \n\u201cmissold\u201d a financial service by a financial institution, is the most difficult to implement.  \nThe  new  customer  protection  rules  of  the  Financial  Sector  Legislation  Regulation \nReforms Commission stipulate clearly defined processes for monitoring suitability and \npenal action for violation. Both the commission and the Mor Committee recommended \nthe  creation  of  a  unified  financial  redress  agency  for  customer  grievance  redress \nacross  all  financial  products  and  services,  which  will,  in  turn,  coordinate  with  the \nrespective regulator.  \nMore  stringent  customer  protection  laws  alone  are  unlikely  to  achieve  financial \ninclusion. This must be complemented by a significant increase in financial literacy.19  \nIn  2013,  India  ranked  the  lowest  in  financial  literacy  among  16  countries  in  the  \nAsia-Pacific  region,  based  on  a  survey  of  7,756  respondents  aged  16\u201364  years \n(MasterCard 2015). To help improve financial literacy, some banks have set up literacy \ncenters  that  work  with  microfinance  organizations.  The  Citi  Center  for  Financial \nLiteracy,  in  Ahmedabad,  has  an  outreach  of  500,000  stakeholders,  a  significant \nnumber  for  an  individual  bank  but  tiny  in  relation  to  the  entire  population  of  the \nunderbanked. RBI has also launched  a financial literacy project among the target \ngroups of schoolchildren, senior citizens, and military personnel. In its school-level \ninitiative, RBI personnel use an interactive module to teach the fundamental concepts \nof financial literacy. It has also been suggested that financial literacy be included in  \nthe  school  curriculum.  Stand-alone  financial  literacy  drives,  similar  to  many  other \nawareness campaigns, are likely to have only limited success.  \nThe extensive penetration of mobile telephones makes them a potent platform for \npromoting  financial  literacy.  Media  experts  have  suggested  that  games  and \ncompetitions  built  around  a  financial  literacy  theme  can  be  disseminated  through  \nthe  telecommunications  network.  Financial  literacy  modules  can  also  be  shown  \nalong  with  television  programs  and  films;  for  this  objective,  rural  India  has  many \ntraveling cinemas.  \n5.  MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES \nIt is well recognized that MSMEs20 are large contributors to the national GDP and \nprovide meaningful employment to over 100 million workers (MMSME 2014). It is also \nwell established that the credit needs of these enterprises have been largely ignored by \n                                                \n19 The concept of financial literacy must encompass understanding of both financial products and services, \nas well as the basic and advanced operations of the banking system. For instance, customers in rural \nareas are not well equipped to deal with advanced biometric systems. In fact, most of them do not even \npossess the basic knowledge of opening a deposit account.  \n20 Development Commissioner, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India. \nWhat Are Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises? http://www.dcmsme.gov.in/ssiindia/defination_msme.htm \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nthe formal financial system. The sector employs an estimated 59.7 million persons \nspread over 26.1 million enterprises. In terms of value, it accounts for about 45% of the \nmanufacturing output and around 40% of the total export of the country, next only to \nthe agriculture sector. The survey showed that only 5.18% of the units (both registered \nand unregistered) received finance from institutional sources, 2.05% had finance from \nnoninstitutional sources, and the majority (92.77%) had no finance or depended on \nself-finance. This has also partly to do with inadequate penetration of banking facilities \nin  the  remote  areas  that  RBI  is  encouraging  banks  to  bridge  through  structured \nfinancial inclusion plans. Alternative sources of finance, such as risk or venture capital, \nare scarce; thus, these enterprises have to fall back on debt from informal institutional \nsources, often at extremely high interest rates.  \nFigure 2: Financial Exclusion in the Micro, Small,  \nand Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector \n(%) \n \nSource: Chakrabarty (2013) \nThe survey also revealed that the few who borrow from banks do so at prohibitively \nhigh costs, 13%\u201315%. The lack of formal finance for these units is often driven by the \nperception that they constitute poor-quality credit and that their loan impairment ratio is \nhigh (Chakrabarty 2013). However, adjusting for write-offs and restructuring, micro and \nsmall enterprises actually fare better than their larger counterparts (Table 10).  \nTable 10: Impaired Assets Ratio  \n(%) \nSegment  March 2009  March 2010  March 2011  March 2012  March 2013 \nMicro and Small  10.7  10.6  9.4  9.7  10.6 \nMedium and Large  7.8  9.4  8  11.2  14.8 \nImpaired assets ratio = (gross nonperforming assets + restructured standard advances + cumulative write-off) to  \n(total advances + cumulative write-off.)  \nSource: Chakrabarty (2013).  \nSome of the constraints faced by MSMEs will be met by the greater penetration of \nbanking  itself  either  through  physical  branches,  information  and  communications \ntechnology-based branches, or business correspondents. These, however, must be \ncombined with aggregate credit targets specified by the Prime Minister\u2019s Task Force  \non MSMEs that stipulated 20% credit growth to micro and small enterprises on a  \nyear-on-year basis. Banks have also been directed to follow a cluster-based approach \nto MSMEs to ensure that banks develop specialized industry expertise in their lending \nwhile reducing their transaction costs (GOI 2010). RBI has also directed banks to open \nmore specialized branches for MSMEs and to simplify credit approval processes.  \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nThere is also a serious dearth of equity capital, a major impediment for first-generation \nentrepreneurs who need equity financing for start-up ventures. This has been partly \naddressed  by  the  dedicated  platforms  set  up  for  MSMEs  by  the  National  Stock \nExchange of India and Bombay Stock Exchange. Listings on these two exchanges \nhave started to increase since mid-2013. The Bombay Stock Exchange platform has  \n90 firms listed on it, but the listings on the National Stock Exchange of India have been \nmuch lower. Indeed, the numbers of firms operating on both exchanges are small given \nthe size of the sector.21 \nMSMEs  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  considerable  delay  in  settlement  of  dues  \nand payment of bills by large-scale buyers. This has to be institutionally tackled by \nfactoring, and banks should provide such services, particularly to MSMEs. To facilitate \nfactoring services, the government passed the Factoring Regulation Act in 2011, which \naddresses delays in payment and liquidity problems of MSMEs. Factoring provides \nliquidity to MSMEs against their receivables from customers, and is regarded as a cash \nmanagement tool. Factors are entitled to take legal recourse for recovering assigned \ndebt and receivables from buyers of goods and services. Despite the institution of  \na legal framework, factoring is yet to take off in a significant manner, due to lack of \ncredit insurance, lack of clarity on stamp duty waivers by states, and lack of access to  \ndebt-recovery platforms. All of these issues need to be resolved as part of the financial \ninclusion initiative. \nBanks also have a vital role to play in nurturing the sector, and this cannot cease with \nthe provision of credit. Banks and other financial institutions must view themselves  \nnot just as providers of credit but as partners in the growth of these enterprises, by \naiding first-generation entrepreneurs. Typically, MSMEs operate with low productivity  \nof capital and have either too little or too much cash. The tools for this work are fully \ndeveloped  (e.g.,  cash-flow  forecasts  and  cash-flow  management).  The  financial \nmanagement  needs  of  MSMEs  are  predictable,  and  banks,  by  providing  these \nservices, can reap enormous rewards in terms of fee-income, enhancing business \nvolumes, and boosting the credit quality of these firms.  \nSpeedy  disbursal  of  loans  to  MSMEs  is  contingent  on  the  efficiency  of  the  \nappraisal  process.  An  important  dimension  to  efficiency  in  the  context  of  lending \ndecisions is the speed with which any individual lending decision is taken. Efficiency  \nis improved by better evaluation of future payment performance, so that the lender is \nable to choose whom to accept. RBI recommended that a credit-scoring approach \ntypical  for  large-volume  consumer  loans  be  used,  instead  of  a  more  elaborate  \ncredit-rating approach.  \nThe newly formed MUDRA Bank has a key role in catalyzing fund flows to MSMEs. \nMUDRA Bank aims to meet the credit needs of the unfunded categories, broadly \ndefined  as  self-employed  or  own-account  enterprises.  Borrowers  in  these  MSMEs \ngenerally  lack standardized  documents  and  do  not  have  the  collateral  that formal \nsector financial institutions seek. This market segment is large, almost entirely in the \nunorganized  sector,  and  vulnerable  to  a  range  of  economic  shocks.  The  primary \npurpose of the bank is refinancing for lending to MSMEs. It is also envisaged to \nperform regulatory functions for all types of entities in the microfinance space.  \n   \n                                                \n21 Issue sizes on the exchanges have ranged from Rs50 million to Rs250 million. \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nExperience in India has shown that incorporating regulation and financing functions \nwithin a single institution can be challenging. As RBI currently oversees the activities of \nMFIs, dual oversight and the attendant risk of regulatory arbitrage are a possibility. In \nthe aftermath of the 2010 crisis, RBI facilitated the development of a well-articulated \nframework  for  governance,  including  a  revival  of  investor  confidence.  At  present,  \nMFIs that represent over 90% of the microfinance industry are supervised by the \ncentral bank.  \n6.  CONCLUSION \nTo address the market failure to provide financial services to low-income clients, India \nhas a huge opportunity. For the first time in the last decade, financial inclusion is at the \nheart  of  the  policy  agenda,  and  it  has  been  widened  to  include  savings,  credit, \ninsurance, and pensions. Technology increasingly affords the opportunity to improve \ndelivery; in particular, there are technologies that enable better targeting and transfer of \nfinancial resources to households.  \nToday,  India  has  several  strategic  assets  providing  favorable  conditions  for  \nchange-leveraging technology. A strong banking network of 115,000 branches linked to \nekuber (i.e., RBI's core banking solution) is spreading into rural areas that lack banks. \nIndian Post, with 155,000 outlets, has a payment-banking license, and point-of-sale \nnetworks and ATMs facilitate cash transactions across the country. India\u2019s vibrant \nnetwork of almost 1 billion mobile connections, covering 75% of the population, can \nfacilitate the spread of banking services through the business correspondent model \nand also enable funds transfer over mobile phones. Moreover, Aadhaar, the national \nidentification system that seeks to cover the entire population by 2016, can provide \nbackend verification and the security architecture.  \nMFIs have also emerged as important players in the inclusion space, successfully \nrevitalized after the 2010 crisis due to regulatory intervention and candid introspection \nfollowing  the  severe  public  censure  (Sane  and  Thomas  2013).  Clients  are  now  \noffered  services  with  clear  communication  of  lending  rates,  tenure  of  loans,  and \nrepayment  flexibility.  Complementing  these  regulatory  directions,  there  have  been \nmany self-regulatory initiatives aimed at promoting responsible business practices in \nthe microfinance market. RBI has also raised its lending limits for MFIs that will allow \nthem to serve a wider section of borrowers.  \nThe new architecture of inclusion reflects the failure of the traditional formal sector  \nand the need to adopt modern methods to serve the poor. In this context, regulation \nhas  a  fundamental  role  to  play  in  ensuring  that  market-oriented  solutions  to  \npoverty  alleviation  coexist  with  other  social  initiatives.  India\u2019s  financial  inclusion  \nagenda  has  seen  a  welcome  shift  away  from  an  emphasis  on  credit  to  a  more \ncomprehensive approach.  \n   \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 568  Barua, Kathuria, and Malik \n \nREFERENCES \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). 2000.
