They are working together to promote \ndevelopment, trade, and commerce throughout the \nEurasian landmass.\n\nIncreasing integration between the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and Japan to the east, the \nRussian Federation to the north, and India and \nPakistan to the south, is leading to unprecedented \nopportunities for Central Asian countries to grow. \nCAREC is helping make that growth happen by \nfacilitating regional transport and trade, and \nimproving trade policy. \n\nFrom 2001 to 2014, the program invested \n\n$24.6\u00a0billion in regional infrastructure and initiatives \nto promote connectivity and trade, helping the \nmostly landlocked countries reach out to global \nmarkets. The deepening regional trade links are \nalso opening up previously unexploited resources, \nincluding huge energy resources.\n\nfor ongoing improvements in living standards of \n300\u00a0million people across Central Asia\u2019s  \nvast geography. \n\nCAREC employs a simple rating system to \nmonitor outputs in four priority sectors, building \na comprehensive picture of how projects and \nactivities are changing lives. Results on the ground \nare compared with stated annual targets\u2014such \nas kilometers of roads and railways built, energy \ntransmission lines laid, or improvements in \ndevelopment indicators\u2014and show clearly where \nthe program is on track or falling short of goals and \nobjectives. Transparent monitoring and identification \nof issues and challenges through an annual \neffectiveness review make it possible for CAREC \nto correct its course if needed, and maximize the \nprogram\u2019s impact.\n\nThe spirit of trust and confidence that has \nemerged after more than a decade of shared action \nby good neighbors and partners is resulting in \nbetter prospects for all.\n\nInfrastructure rollout has increased the mobility \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has served \n\nof people and goods, and laid the foundation \n\nas the CAREC Secretariat since 2001.\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n1\n1\n\nGood neighbors, good partners, good prospects\fThe CAREC countries \n\n\u2022\t People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n\u2022\t Afghanistan\n\n\u2022\t Azerbaijan\n\n\u2022\t Kazakhstan\n\n\u2022\t Kyrgyz Republic\n\n\u2022\t Mongolia\n\n\u2022\t Pakistan\n\n\u2022\t Tajikistan\n\n\u2022\t Turkmenistan\n\n\u2022\t Uzbekistan\n\nThe CAREC multilateral  \ninstitution partners\n\n\u2022\t Asian Development Bank \n\n\u2022\t European Bank for Reconstruction  \n\nand Development\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nInternational Monetary Fund\n\nIslamic Development Bank\n\n\u2022\t United Nations Development Programme\n\n\u2022\t World Bank\n\nIncreased Investment,  \nWider-Ranging Actions\n\nSharing Knowledge                           \nand Experience\n\nFrom a modest start just over a decade ago, \nCAREC has evolved into a comprehensive program \nof practical, results-based regional projects and \npolicy initiatives that are crucial to trade and \nsustainable development. \n\nThe number and value of CAREC projects\u2014 \n\nincluding loans and grants\u2014have grown \nfrom 6\u00a0projects worth $247 million in 2001 to \n158\u00a0projects worth about $24.6 billion in 2014. \n\nAfter first focusing on investment in transport, \n\nthe program has gradually expanded to embrace \nwider-ranging strategies for tackling trade, trade \npolicy, and energy challenges. By recognizing the \nscale of opportunities to break down barriers and \nshare resources, CAREC has harnessed the power of \nregional cooperation, helping build a global future.\n\nKey to overall success is the CAREC Institute, \nwhich works hand in hand with the groups \nand committees responsible for guiding and \nimplementing the program in each priority \narea. Established in 2006, the institute is a hub \nfor building knowledge networks and sharing \nexperience, enhancing the strategic and technical \nadvice that the six multilateral institution partners \nprovide to ensure that investments achieve the best \npossible results.\n\nRegional cooperation is a powerful planning \n\ntool for countries to get national projects with \nregional benefits off the ground. CAREC is \ndeepening that collective engagement, which will \nbe more and more important in dealing with the \nchallenges of an increasingly integrated global \neconomy. \n\n \n\nSee CAREC\u2019s annual performance snapshot: The Development Effectiveness Review \nwww.carecprogram.org/index.php?page=carec-development-effectiveness-review\n\n2\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n\f20,000\n\n18,000\n\n16,000\n\n14,000\n\n12,000\n\n10,000\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n0\n\n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n$\n(\n \n\ne\nm\nu\n\nl\n\no\nV\n\nFigure 1: Volume of Approved CAREC-Related Projects, by Sector, Cumulative since 2001\n\n19,579\n\n17,732\n\n17,282\n\n14,116\n\n12,067\n\n10,542\n\n6,073\n\n3,846\n\n2,531\n\n490\n\n86\n\n490\n\n148\n\n1,414\n\n162\n\n1,768\n\n196\n\n3,073\n\n247\n\n3,442\n\n3,707\n\n4,389\n\n4,599\n\n247\n\n247\n\n268\n\n420\n\n2006                        2007                     2008                     2009                     2010                     2011                      2012                     2013                     2014\n\nTransport\n\nEnergy\n\nTrade facilitation\n\nCAREC = Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation.

It aims to turn \nlandlocked nations into land-linked economies. \nTo achieve its two distinct objectives of expanding \ntrade and improving competitiveness, the strategy \nemploys focused, action-oriented, and results-\ndriven regional projects and initiatives centered on \ntransport, trade facilitation, trade policy, energy, \nand the development of economic corridors. \n\nEver closer partnerships between CAREC and \n\nnational implementation agencies, along with \nefforts to increase private sector participation, \nhave strengthened the results orientation of \nthe program, which emphasizes strong country \nownership, pragmatic approaches, and mutual \naccountability. \n\nTransport, trade facilitation, trade policy, \nand energy became the four priority areas for \ncooperation in 2006. The benefits are already \nclear, with people and goods moving more freely \nthrough their own and neighboring countries. \nIncreased trade is also creating opportunities that \nare raising living standards.\n\nTransport, the most capital-intensive of the \n\npriority areas, has received the lion\u2019s share of \ntargeted financing for infrastructure since the 2007 \nintroduction of six CAREC road and rail corridors. \nThis 29,350-kilometer (km) transport network \nconnects markets in the north of the PRC with \nAzerbaijan in the Caucasus\u2014providing access to \nEurope\u2014and also stretches from Kazakhstan to \nPakistan\u2019s sea ports and beyond. \n\n44\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n\fBut better transport links alone are not enough \n\nto realize the CAREC vision. Countries are working \ntogether to move people, goods, and vehicles \nacross borders faster, and more efficiently and \ncheaply. They are securing the energy needed to \ngrow their economies by developing infrastructure \nand embarking on ambitious plans for mutually \n\nbeneficial trade in electricity. Regional cooperation \nis also expanding commercial opportunities by \nsimplifying and liberalizing trading regimes, \nbreaking down policy barriers that were put in \nplace by successor states established when the \nSoviet Union dissolved more than 2\u00a0decades ago.\n\n \n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n5\n5\n\n\fPROGRAM STRATEGIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nTRANSPORT\n\nThe plan to link Central Asia to global markets has \nalready led to the construction and rehabilitation \nof 7,672 km of quality road and rail links between \nkey cities and towns, also connecting innumerable \ncommunities along routes that often trace the \nancient Silk Road.\n\nAlmost $19.6 billion had been invested from \n\n2001 to 2014 in 107 CAREC-related transport \nprojects along the six CAREC corridor routes, where \nthe potential for economic development and \n\nreturns is greatest. At the end of 2014, 70 of \nthe projects were ongoing.\n\nPriority infrastructure work along the six \ncorridors is now focused on the construction  \nand upgrade of roads and rail lines. The aim is  \nto create a seamless transport network by \n2020. By 2013, about 4,970 km of roads along \nthe six corridors, and  3,190 km of railway  \nconstruction and rehabilitation had been \ncompleted.\n\nSource: CAREC Transport Sector Progress Report (Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting, 26-27 June, 2014). http://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/\nevents/2013/SOM-Oct-KAZ/002_102_206_Transport-Sector-Progress-report-and-Work-Plan.pdf\n\n6\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n\f \n\n \n\nI\n\nI\n\nC\nM\nO\nN\nO\nC\nE\nL\nA\nN\nO\nG\nE\nR\nA\nI\nS\nA\nL\nA\nR\nT\nN\nE\nC\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI\n\nS\nR\nO\nD\nR\nR\nO\nC\nN\nO\nI\nT\nA\nR\nE\nP\nO\nO\nC\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n7\n\n\fThe Way to Go\n\nThe rebuilt and upgraded CAREC roads have improved living standards. The Third Road Rehabilitation Project, \nconnecting Corridors 1, 2, and 3, has cut journey times between the Kyrgyz Republic capital, Bishkek, and the \nsouthern city of Osh\u2014the country\u2019s second largest\u2014by as much as a third. The number of households using \nmotorized transport has also doubled. Tangible progress was already evident in 2006, with 20% more people \nable to commute to work than in 2004.\n\nGains were also achieved by improving the main road corridor for Azerbaijan\u2019s non-oil trade, and by \nstrengthening its national road organization. The Azerbaijan Highway Project rebuilt or upgraded 94 km of \nroad between Ganja and Gazakh, which forms part of Corridor 2. Travel times were reduced by 33% along the \nShamkir\u2013Gazakh section of the highway, and 14,000 people benefited from improvements to local roads. The \nresulting fall in transport costs has led to increased freight and passenger traffic.\n\nSimilar outcomes were reported for Tajikistan\u2019s Road Rehabilitation Project (connecting Corridors 3 and 5), with \na 25%\u201330% increase in private travel and freight traffic. Better roads have also led to less damage and lower \ncosts for consumers. In 2006, a 20% growth in small businesses in the project area was also reported.\n\nThe building of the first railway in Afghanistan, a 75 km single-line track between Hairatan, on the bustling \nUzbekistan border, and Mazar-e-Sharif\u2014Afghanistan\u2019s second largest city\u2014presents a vivid example of what \ncooperation between neighbors in CAREC can achieve. The project is the first phase of a larger rail network \nplanned for Afghanistan, including links to the city of Herat and to Tajikistan and Pakistan, adding capacity to \nCorridors 3 and 6, and opening up alternative trade routes. Meanwhile, reconstruction of Afghanistan\u2019s ring \nroad is creating easier access to southern markets.\n\nCAREC = Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, km = kilometer.               \nSource: ADB. 2009.

Without the determined \nmeasures taken to reform and modernize border \nmanagement, the effectiveness of transport \ncorridors would be severely diminished.\n\nUnder the refined CAREC Transport and Trade \n\nFacilitation Strategy 2020, simplified regulations \nand automated procedures to improve border \nmanagement are steadily being put in place, \nwith information on time and cost savings shared \nbetween government agencies, road carriers, and \nfreight forwarders. Customs codes that incorporate \ngood practice as elaborated in the World Customs \nOrganization\u2019s Revised Kyoto Convention are being \nadopted, and improvements to infrastructure \nat border-crossing points are being introduced \ntogether with effective risk-management systems. \nThese measures are helping reduce the amount of \ntime consumed by border-crossing formalities. Joint \ncustoms control pilot projects being undertaken by \nCAREC neighbors complement these efforts.\n\nPilot projects using bilingual, harmonized cargo \n\nmanifests have been conducted at the PRC\u2013\nKazakhstan border since 2007 and at the PRC\u2013\nMongolia border since 2009, with highly positive \nresults. Use of the harmonized manifests has \nhelped reduce time and cost for traders and reduce \nincidences of customs violations. Data accuracy \nhas improved. The scope of such pilot projects is \ntherefore being expanded: under the Regional \nImprovement of Border Services (RIBS) project, \nTajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic have committed \nto introduce joint customs control at selected \nborder-crossing points.\n\nSeveral CAREC countries are in the process \nof developing single-window facilities that will \neventually allow traders to lodge information just \none time via a single portal to fulfill all import- and \nexport-related regulatory reporting requirements. \nUltimately, national single windows will exchange \ninformation regionally, expediting transnational \njourneys on CAREC corridors. RIBS is helping make \nthis possible by developing single-window facilities \nand improving infrastructure at border-crossing \npoints. Corridor Performance Measurement and \nMonitoring (CPMM) data and information gathered \nby members of the CAREC Federation of Carrier and \nForwarder Associations (CFCFA), formed in 2009, \nreveal where and why trade blockages occur. CFCFA\u2019s \nmembers report that customs clearance, border \n\n10\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n\fsecurity, transport inspections, and the application of \nsanitary and phytosanitary measures were the most \nfrequent causes of delay.\n\nContinued monitoring of time\u2013cost\u2013distance \n\ndata gathered under CPMM will document the \nachievement of targets and objectives set forth in \nthe refined CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy 2020.  Guided by CPMM, Time Release \nStudies to be conducted by CAREC countries will \nhelp integrate customs measures with the efforts \nof government agencies and support the design of \npublic\u2013private partnerships. The aim is to develop \nefficient trade logistics services with reliable, well-\nmaintained infrastructure.\n\nRecognition is growing that the key to success \nis improved public\u2013private dialogue: one possible \nmechanism to pursue this objective may be the \nequal participation of private logistics and freight-\nforwarding associations, as well as government \n\nagencies in charge of transport, trade, and border-\ncrossing activities in national joint transport and \ntrade facilitation committees, where appropriate. \nSeminars, workshops, and technical training sessions \non priority areas for customs and trade facilitation \nhave been held to increase the professionalism, \nefficiency, and quality of CAREC road carriers, freight \nforwarders, and logistics companies. Customs \nofficials in specialist areas, such as the automation of \ncustoms procedures, and customs intelligence, have \nalso participated. \n\nCustoms administrations are changing: once \noriented toward control, they are now beginning to \nfacilitate compliance. By supporting investments in \ninfrastructure, simplification of border management \nprocedures, and development of an efficient logistics \nindustry, CAREC partners are helping businesses save \ntime and money, and making them competitive with \nthe rest of the world.\n\nTrade Facilitation Results\n\n Joint customs control between the PRC and Mongolia pilot-tested\n\n Customs processes being automated in most CAREC countries\n\n Corridor performance measurement and monitoring instituted\u2014and trade facilitation \nindicators developed\u2014to assess and evaluate corridor efficiency\n\n 21-member CAREC Federation of Carrier and Forwarder Associations (CFCFA) active \nthroughout the region\n\n $419.9 million mobilized by CAREC since 2002 for 15 projects to support growth in trade\n\n Clearing times at border-crossing points in the first half of 2014 up 76% compared with the \nsame period in 2013, to an average of about 15 hours\n\n Transit costs at borders in the first half of the year 2014 down 28% compared with 2013, to an \naverage of $180\n\n The fastest crossings in the first half of year 2014 achieved along Corridor 1, with an average \nclearing time of 2.7 hours; shortest time of 5 minutes recorded at Kairak in Kazakhstan and \n1 minute at Troitsk in Russia (for traffic exiting Kazakhstan) due to Customs Union-related \nabolition of customs formalities at internal borders. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nKnow more about CFCFA and corridor performance measurement and monitoring results\n\nwww.cfcfa.net\n\nAccess the CAREC trade facilitation portfolio\n\nwww.carecprogram.org/index.php?page=trade-facilitation-projects\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n11\n\nSimplified regulations and automated procedures for harmonizing customs procedures are steadily being put in place\fThe vision for the sector is \nto ensure energy security, \nefficiency, and economic \ngrowth across the region\n\nThe potential of regional cooperation to change \n\npeople\u2019s lives can be seen in cross-border energy \ntrade. In 2013, for example, 1,296 gigawatt hours of \npower from Uzbekistan were supplied to Kabul, the \ncapital of Afghanistan, providing many of the city\u2019s \n5\u00a0million people with a continuous electricity supply \nfor the first time in decades. \n\nSimilarly, in 2013, 939 gigawatt hours of summer \n\nsurplus electricity from Tajikistan were supplied to \nAfghanistan via the 220-kilovolt transmission line. \nThis line was constructed through the Regional Power \nTransmission Interconnection Project completed in \nMay 2011. \n\nThis electricity benefits about 1.5\u00a0million people \n\nin the northern part of the country. In addition, \n396 gigawatt hours of power were imported by \nAfghanistan from Turkmenistan in 2013.\n\nTransmission lines stretching 2,322 km have \nbeen completed as a direct output of CAREC-related \nprojects. An estimated 755 km of high-voltage \noverhead transmission lines will be installed or \nupgraded by 2015, with CAREC\u2019s results framework \ntracking this goal and reporting progress. \n\nImprovements in energy efficiency and regional \nconnectivity are results expected from the Talimarjan \npower plant, 440 km southwest of Tashkent, the \ncapital of Uzbekistan, where Uzbekenergo, the \nstate-run power utility, is building Central Asia\u2019s first \n929-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine power \nplant. It is expected to be completed by 2015 with \nCAREC support. \n\nENERGY\n\nCentral Asia\u2019s rich fossil-fuel reserves and water \nresources make the region one of the world\u2019s most \nimportant energy centers. CAREC\u2019s projects and \ninitiatives offer regional and national approaches to \nunblocking these resources, which are essential to \novercome current uneven distribution and seasonal \nvariations in supplies.\n\nThe vision for the sector is to ensure energy \nsecurity, efficiency, and economic growth across \nthe region by stimulating trade in power supplies. \nThe program has mobilized around $4.6 billion \nsince 2001 for 36 projects, most of them aimed at \nexpanding bilateral electricity trade and improving \nthe regional power network. At the end of 2014, 23\u00a0of \nthe projects will be ongoing. Over $51.82\u00a0million in \ntechnical assistance has also flowed into the region \nsince 2001.*\n\nAchievements include increased generation \ncapacity, rehabilitation and construction of new \ntransmission assets, modernization of power \nsystems, knowledge sharing, and the adoption of \nkey policy measures such as a regional power sector \nmaster plan, and efforts to promote a region-wide \npower grid.\n\n* 2014 figures are indicative.\n\n12\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n\fThe CAREC Energy Action Plan, approved in \n\n2009, emphasized the expansion of integrated \ngeneration and transmission infrastructure to meet \npower needs and promote new resources. In 2012, \nthe Energy Work Plan 2013\u20132015 was adopted to \nensure effective and timely achievement of the \nstrategic objectives laid out in CAREC 2020, and \nhas six actionable elements to implement sector \noperational priorities:\n\n\u2022 Element 1.  Developing the Central Asia\u2013South \nAsia energy corridor\n\u2022 Element 2.  Resolving regional energy dispatch \nand trade issues\n\u2022 Element 3.  Managing energy\u2013water linkages \nElement 4.  Mobilizing funds for building \nenergy assets\n\u2022 Element 5.  Implementation of energy sector \npriority projects\n\u2022 Element 6.  Capacity building and knowledge \nmanagement\n\nIn accordance with CAREC\u2019s strategic vision, \nthe Energy Work Plan will establish the foundations \nfor energy security over the next decade through \nregional cooperation, exploiting the potential for \nintraregional trade, while promoting more efficient, \nrenewable energy. Substantial effort is being put into \npromoting interregional trade in electricity between \nCentral Asia and South Asia.\n\nCAREC\u2019s multilateral institution partners are \nconducting studies on energy supply and demand, \nalong with the regional regulatory environment. \n\nRegional Power Master Plan\n\nA master plan has been developed to overcome the \ninfrastructure constraints on trade in electricity. The \ngoal is to end a common problem in which one part of \nthe region has more energy than it needs while others \nare in short supply. The plan aims to share the supply \nof power between Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, Uzbekistan\u2014the Central Asian power \nsystem\u2014and Afghanistan. It also aims to integrate the \nexpansion of generation and transmission of power, \nwhile promoting regulations and policies that support \nits trade.  \n\nAfghanistan Power Sector Master Plan\n\nThe master plan was developed to support the \nGovernment of Afghanistan in identifying power \nsector deficiencies and systematically prioritizing \nthe sector\u2019s rehabilitation needs.  The objective is \nto optimize and integrate transmission, and expand \ngeneration, to promote interregional electricity trade, \nimprove energy security and efficiency, and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.  It also aimed to increase \nthe capacity of the Ministry of Energy and Water to a \nlevel at which the ministry can analyze the country\u2019s \npower sector needs without the help of a third party.\n\nSource: CAREC. 2013.

As they \nare mostly landlocked nations rich in resources\u2014\nnatural or otherwise\u2014their ability to efficiently \ninteract with world markets is critical to achieving \nsustainable economic growth.\n\nThrough the Trade Policy Strategic Action Plan, \n\nCAREC seeks to boost trade by helping countries \ntake concrete steps to dismantle policy barriers \nand achieve World Trade Organization (WTO) \nmembership.\n\nThe action plan aims to simplify and liberalize \n\nnational trade regimes within a reasonable \ntimeframe, improving the investment climate \nacross Central Asia. Specific initiatives include \nuniformly applying value-added and excise taxes \non domestically produced and imported goods, \ncutting tariffs, and eliminating quantitative \nrestrictions on exports and imports.\n\nCAREC is also helping government officials \nbuild skills and stay up to date on international best \npractices in trade policy. Training and information \nexchanges improve the institutional environment \n\nfor policies that increase intra- and interregional \ntrade volumes. \n\nRegional knowledge forums and joint \nmonitoring of the implementation of the Trade \nPolicy Strategic Action Plan (TPSAP) play their part \nin moving CAREC toward its goals and targets. \nThe implementation of the TPSAP 2008\u20132012 was \nmonitored through a composite indicator\u2014the \nCAREC Trade Liberalization Index. \n\nThe index was based on a questionnaire \n\ndesigned by the program\u2019s Trade Policy Coordinating \nCommittee and the International Monetary Fund, \ntracking CAREC countries\u2019 progress over 2009\u20132012 \nin reducing or eliminating specific quantitative \nrestrictions and tariffs, and in simplifying trade  \ntax regimes.\n\nCAREC analysis of the Customs Union (CU), \nconducted in 2012 (Kazakhstan joined the CU in \n2010), indicated early evidence of trade diversion \n(e.g., positive impact on imports from CU countries \nvs. negative impact on imports from non-CU \ncountries), but the effects of trade creation were not \n\n14\n\nFrom Landlocked to Linked In: The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program\n\n\fyet clear. Nonetheless, the arrangement may have \na positive long-term impact due to service trade \nliberalization and investments, improved market \naccess, and lower nontariff barriers. \n\nThe WTO Accession Knowledge Sharing \nProgram has been launched, jointly sponsored \nby ADB and the World Bank, to support trade \nliberalization. The first three WTO training seminars \ntook place in March, May, and July 2012.\n\nMonitored results in the institutional \nenvironment for trade show that, as of 2012,  \nmany CAREC countries had achieved progress,  \nbut with considerable variations in institutional \nquality, and most countries have substantial  \nroom for improvement.\n\nAs policy actions and reforms in trade  \npolicy concentrate on building knowledge and \ncapacity, CAREC is supporting greater openness \nand competition.\n\nThe TPSAP 2013\u20132017 builds on and \n\nencompasses the agenda of the previous TPSAP, \nand expands the agenda into important areas for \nintegrating CAREC countries into the world trading \nenvironment: (i) expanding trade in services; and \n(ii) reducing and rationalizing nontariff measures, \n\nMeasures of Openness\n\nBased on data received from CAREC \ncountries, the average value of the Trade \nLiberalization Index for reporting countries \nincreased from 5.5 in 2010 to 15.2 by the \nend of 2012, falling below the target of \n20.0. \n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic was the only country \nto reach the end-of-2012 target ahead of \ntime.

CAREC 2020 will be the road \nmap for expanding trade and increasing global \ncompetitiveness through the second decade of \nregional cooperation.\n\nButtressing CAREC 2020 is a rolling list of \npriority investments and technical assistance \nprojects for 2011\u20132020. CAREC has identified the \nremaining necessary projects to be implemented \nthrough 2017 and beyond to complete the \nupgrading of the six CAREC corridors. \n\nUnder CAREC 2020, countries own the projects \nand integrate them into their national development \nplans. To raise needed resources, existing \npartnerships with multilateral institutions will be \nstrengthened and broadened to include bilateral \ndonor agencies and the private sector.  \n\nAllied to the institutional set up, the \n\nCAREC Institute plays a vital role in stimulating \ncooperation, as well as providing an analytical \nunderpinning for the program. The institute helps \nbuild knowledge networks so that all involved, \nfrom national agencies to private partners, can \nshare and learn from their experiences, and apply \ninternational best practices in all CAREC initiatives.\n\nThe institute also coordinates information \n\nsharing in secondary areas of mutual interest to \nCAREC partners\u2014the regional public goods that \nimpact all countries, including communicable \ndisease control, disaster risk management, and \nclimate change. \n\nUnder the 2020 strategy, the CAREC Institute \nwill be reenergized to support the priority sectors \nas well as second-tier areas such as communicable \ndisease control, disaster risk management, and \nclimate change proofing, among others.
