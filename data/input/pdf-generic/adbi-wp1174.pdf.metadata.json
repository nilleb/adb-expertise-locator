INTRODUCTION \nCoastal  zones  are  very  important  from  environmental  and  economic  perspectives  \ndue to various human activities, such as tourism and aquaculture (Boteler 2014). The \nlatter cause negative effects on coastal environments, whose resources should be \nmanaged in a sustainable manner (Tonazzini et al. 2019). Coastal zones and marine \nenvironments are the main interest of the Blue Economy concept and framework. The \nBlue Economy encompasses activities related to many industries, such as fisheries, \naquaculture, tourism, transport, and energy (UN/ECA 2016a). Hence, the Blue Economy \nis a concept and framework for policy making and investment aimed at preserving and \nproperly exploiting the sea and coastal environment. \nThe Blue Economy concept is defined and described in various ways. According to the \nWorld Bank (2017), it is the \u201csustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, \nimproved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of the ocean ecosystem.\u201d The \nEuropean Commission defines it as \u201call economic activities related to oceans, seas, and \ncoasts.  It  covers  a  wide  range  of  interlinked  established  and  emerging  sectors\u201d \n(European  Union  2018).  The  approach  of  the  Blue  Economy  is  premised  on  the \nsustainable use, management, and conservation of aquatic and marine ecosystems and \nassociated  resources  (UN/ECA  2016a).  The  Blue  Economy  framework  offers  an \nintegrated, systemic, dynamic, inclusive, participatory, and ecosystem-based approach, \nand environmental, social, and economic dimensions are intertwined and pursued for all \nBlue Economy activities (EU 2018). It is worth pointing out that the Blue Economy builds \non Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). All over the world coastal countries \nare incorporating the considerations and framework of the Blue Economy into their \ndevelopment plans (UN/ECA 2016a). \nAgainst this background, it is believed that there is a need for more empirical research \nand to capitalize on experiences of implementing projects in the field of sustainable \ntourism  management  (STM)  in  coastal  and  maritime  zones.  Literature  suggests \napproaches,  frameworks,  and  tools  for  achieving  this  aim;  however,  when  these \nframeworks and tools are implemented they are faced with a series of challenges, issues, \nand barriers that make their efficiency and effectiveness questionable. It is the argument \nof  this  study  that  practitioners  and  academics  can  benefit  from  experiences  of \nimplementation.  The  approaches  and  ways  adopted,  and  the  issues  and  barriers \nencountered, can give us useful lessons for improving the performance in this field. \nTourism  is  regarded  as  a  pillar  in these  frameworks  for sustainable  coastal  zone \nmanagement (SCZM).  \nAgainst  this  background,  this  paper  adopts  a supply/coastal  zone  perspective  and \nfocuses  on  the  interrelationship  between  tourism  management  and  environmental \nprotection in coastal zones. The main research question is: \u201cWhat lessons could we take \nfrom practical experiences?\u201d The purpose of this paper is to address this question and \nto  suggest  a  framework  of  critical  success  factors  (CSFs)  and  guidelines  for  \nSTM. The paper uses the case study research method to achieve the aim. The study\u2019s \nfocus is on gaining insights and capitalizing on real-world experience from ICZM plans \nimplemented in four countries.  \nHence,  this  study  takes  a  coastal  zone  perspective  and  focuses  on  STM  \u2013  the \nsustainable  interrelationship  between  tourism  management  and  environmental \nprotection \u2012 in coastal zones within the general context of the Blue Economy. Therefore, \nthis study aims to gain valuable insights for implementation experiences. The main \nresearch question is: \u201cWhat lessons could we take from practical experiences?\u201d The \npurpose of this paper is to address this question and to suggest a framework of CSFs \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \nand guidelines for STM. The paper uses the case study research method to achieve the \naim, and the focus is on gaining insights and capitalizing on real-world experience from \nICZM plans.  \nThe paper is structured as follows. A review of literature is performed in Section 2, \noutlining and highlighting the main issues and challenges to address in the field of coastal \nmanagement.  This  is  followed  by  a  synoptic  presentation  and  discussion  of  \nfour case studies on plans and projects in the field of integrated management of coastal \nareas with a special focus on tourism. Section 4 discusses the main lessons to take from \nthe practice and identifies the CSFs for effective implementation of such programs. The \narticle ends with conclusions, implications (theoretical and managerial), and the study\u2019s \nlimitations. \n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \nAcademic research has been (and is still) interested in the field of STM in coastal zones. \nFocusing on the scope and context of this study, a review of literature permits us to \noutline  and  highlight the specific  issues  and challenges  to be  addressed  and  the \nimperative of adopting an integrated approach in this field. \n2.1  Issues and Challenges \nMany issues and challenges for coastal and maritime tourism have been raised by \nscholars. The most critical challenge to managing coastal tourism in a sustainable \nmanner is how to achieve a positive economic impact without negative effects of human \nactivities  on the  resources  of the  coastal  environment  (Prasetyo,  Muhammad  and \nSugianto 2018). \nMore specifically, coastal and maritime tourism is faced with a number of challenges, \nsuch  as  (WTO  2013; European  Commission  2016): the  limited sharing  of  benefits  \nand value of tourism among local communities; poor investment capacity and limited \naccess to finance; limited development potential; and the limited response capacity  \nof local destinations. The \u201cwhole\u201d zone must be perceived by tourists as appealing  \n(in terms of safety, security, good health care, good transport, etc.). There is a need for \ncoastal tourism communities to get access to information/knowledge and to understand \nglobal trends, so as to be able to derive the challenges or opportunities they incur for \ntheir particular strategies.  \nA summary of the main issues and challenges faced by tourism management in coastal \nzones, classified into three fields, is shown in Table 1. \nStrategies  and  measures  are  needed  to  address  the  above  outlined  issues  and \nchallenges in order to achieve an STM in coastal zones (European Commission 2016). \nLiterature suggests that an ICZM framework is a necessity and this tool should be \nadaptable and flexible, ready to take into account and to address the related issues and \nchallenges in an effective manner (Cicin-Sain and Knecht 1998; Shi et al. 2001; Jennings \n2004; Kanji 2006; Marafa 2008). \n   \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \nTable 1: Issues and Challenges in Managing Tourism in Coastal Zones \nFields  Issues and Challenges \nPlanning and  \u2022  Predominantly sectoral approach not contributing to an integrated management. \nmanagement  \u2022  Development planning does not take into account environmental concerns. \n\u2022  Management focus: The prevalence of tourism and urbanization in coastal zones \nfavors traditional land use planning instead of a focus on resource management.  \n\u2022  National- and local-level administrative structures are not effective. \n\u2022  Resource management issues: habitat conservation and restoration, coastal \nhazards, promoting sustainable development. \n\u2022  Coastal safety: need to assess all potential risks, both natural and technological.  \n\u2022  Support management decision-making: scientific research and \ninformation/intelligence, providing tools and supporting technologies. \nGovernance  \u2022  Appropriate models and schemas: suitable partnerships.  \n\u2022  Participation and public awareness: difficulties in mobilizing local stakeholders. \n\u2022  Lack of stakeholder involvement and stakeholder support. \n\u2022  Institutions: limited capacity or inefficient institutions.  \n\u2022  Coordination and cooperation: limited, inefficient, and lack of communication. \n\u2022  Information and capacity building through education. \nEffective  \u2022  The implementation of plans in coastal areas is not effective due to: \nImplementation  \u2022  Partial and incomplete implementation. \n\u2022  Funding: insufficient national financial support for coastal programs.

ICZM \nhas  been  accepted  as  a strategic  management  approach  in  achieving  sustainable \ndevelopment of resources in coastal areas (Sorensen 1993, 2002; Cicin-Sain et al. 2002; \nUNEP 2009).  \nA  robust  definition,  provided  by  Sorenson  (1993),  describes  ICZM  as  \u201cintegrated \nmanagement  that  provides  policy  direction  and  a  process  for  defining  objectives  \nand priorities and planning development beyond sectoral activities. It adopts a systems \nperspective and multisectoral approach that takes into account all sectoral interests and \nstakeholder  interests,  and  deals  with  economic  and  social  issues  as  well  \nas  environmental  and  economic  issues.\u201d  It  is  believed  that  ICZM  is  beneficial  to  \nall  stakeholders  and  enhances  long-term  economic  growth  and  environmental \nconservation by involving all stakeholders and using various instruments for coastal \nmanagement (European Commission 2016). The tourism industry and tourist activities \nare considered to have the potential to contribute to sustainable growth within the  \nBlue Economy framework (UN, Economic Commission for Africa 2016a). The ICZM \nframework is regarded as an efficient tool for coastal management with tourism as  \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \na  key  pillar  (Marafa  2008;  UNEP  2009),  while  contributing  at  the  same  time  to \nenvironmental preservation (Jennings 2004; Kanji 2006). \nIn recent decades the need to implement more e ective ICZM has been increasingly \nrecognized (Mestanza-Ram\u00f3n et al. 2019). However, there are some issues to be \naddressed for ICZM as well, the main ones being\ufb00 the implementation (with economic, \nmanagerial, institutional, and legal aspects), the governance, the coordination between \ninstitutions, and administrative structures. It is worth noting that there are some criticisms \nabout  the  ICZM  framework;  however,  this  is  beyond  the  scope  of  our  \nstudy. The focus of our study is on the effective implementation of coastal tourism \nmanagement. It is argued that ICZM is the best approach contributing to achieve a STM \nin coastal zones. This paper has examined a number of case studies with the aim of \ntaking some lessons from the management and implementation of ICZM programs and \nprojects with a special focus on STM. \n3.  METHODOLOGY: CASE STUDIES  \n3.1  Research Method \nThe argument of our study is that experiences \u2013 initiatives and projects in the Blue \nEconomy field \u2012 are very useful and beneficial. That is the reason why the study \nemployed a qualitative research methodology, i.e., case studies, to address the study\u2019s \naim \u2012 an exploratory case study focusing on a phenomenon within the context of real-\nlife situations and aiming to find answers within the investigated topic. Case studies aim \nto analyze specific issues within the boundaries of a specific context or setting. This \nresearch method is widely accepted and used in the business area (Yin 2003).  \nCase studies that describe particular plans and management processes provide insight \ninto  the  planning  and  management  of  coastal  zones  and  tourism  (Forde  2008). \nPractitioners (policymakers, planners, and managers) and scholars alike should take \nsome  lessons  from  experiences.  The  study\u2019s  aim  is  to  capitalize  on  international \nexperiences to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of such programs. This aim is \nachieved by means of analysis of selected case studies with a specific focus on tourism. \nThe information and data were collected from secondary data, i.e., published documents \n(reports, studies) and websites. \n3.2  Case Studies: Brief Presentation  \nMany ICZM projects and initiatives have been developed all over the world. There were \nfour criteria for selecting the four cases studies presented in the following subsections, \nnamely: (i) representativeness: from various regions/continents \u2012 a broad geographical \nrange, from Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania; (ii) implementation of the Blue Economy \nand STM projects; (iii) advanced stage of implementation; and (iv) the availability of \ninformation and data. The four cases are from Italy, Hong Kong, China, Kenya, and \nAustralia and provide some valuable insights. \n3.2.1  MUSES Project, Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy \nThis case study focuses on coastal and maritime tourism as a potential major driver for \nthe development of multi-use (MU) opportunities \u2012 combinations that can be promoted \nand/or further boosted by using tourism as a development driver and taking into account \nthe existing situation and previous experiences (Saba 2015). \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \n3.2.1.1  Short Geographic Description  \nThe area includes Italian Adriatic internal and territorial waters, including the Veneto and \nEmilia Romagna regions. \nCoastal and maritime tourism represents the main socioeconomic driver in the area. The \ntwo  regions  have  in  common  similar  coastal  and  maritime  tourism  industries  \nand include various maritime activities, such as transport, energy, and aquaculture \n(Meneghello and Mingotto 2016). \nThe MUSES project analyzed the role of coastal and maritime tourism as a major driver \nfor the development of MU opportunities in the Northern Adriatic. The project investigated \nthe potential role of coastal and maritime tourism as a driver of MU development involving \nother  sectors  that  could  greatly  benefit  from  tourism-related  \nMU. The project suggests four tourism-driven combinations: tourism combined with \nfisheries,  aquaculture,  environmental  protection,  and  underwater  cultural  heritage \n(UCH). For the tourism-driven combinations, the project identified a number of driver, \nbarrier, added-value, and impact (DABI) factors. The main DABI factors related to all four \ncombinations  are  political,  institutional/legal,  economic,  social,  environmental,  and \noperational (MUSES Project 2017). \n3.2.1.2  Proposed Action Plan \nThe  suggested  action  plan  to  promote  the  four  tourism-driven  combinations  is \nsummarized in Table 2. \nTable 2: Suggested Action Plan \nFocus Areas  Actions \n1.  Addressing Multi \u2022  Promoting integrated tourist offering by developing a network of tourism-\nUse  related MU initiatives.  \n\u2010 \u2022  Improving the cooperation between different institutions, and promoting \ncross-sector policies.  \n\u2022  Creating specific networks to improve investment attractiveness and \nmanagement capacity. \n\u2022  Forming clusters to develop and manage MU.  \n2.

Strategic/Master  \u2022  All the above actions should be incorporated into an integrated master plan, \nplan   which should contribute to addressing the challenges and issues for \nsustainable development and management. \nSource: Elaborated from MUSES Project (2017). \n3.2.1.3  Main Lessons \nThe main takeaways/lessons from this case study are as follows. The elaboration of a \nvision and strategy/action plans is very useful. The vision must focus on the issues \nrelated  to  sustainability  and  environmental  protection.  Stakeholders\u2019  involvement, \nengagement, and consultation is a must. It is also crucial to develop an integrated \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \noffering  capable  of  linking  natural,  environmental,  and  historical  resources  and  all \nactivities  together,  and  to  create  intersectoral  networks  capable  of  designing  and \npromoting tourist offerings (this objective requires the involvement and cooperation of all \nactors). The legal and administrative barriers (fragmentation of competences and lack of \ncooperation between involved agencies and institutions) are usually the most important \nobstacles to support and implementation. \n3.2.2  COAST Project, Watamu, Kenya \nThis case analyzes and highlights the Collaborative Actions for Sustainable Tourism \n(COAST) project within the framework of the Blue Economy in Africa. Their main purpose \nhas been to provide a focus for action supported by the project in the field of coastal \ntourism.  \n3.2.2.1  The Context \nAccording to studies and reports, the tourism industry has great economic potential if \nproperly  integrated  and  managed.  Accordingly,  stakeholders  have  been  working \ntogether in Kenya on ICZM for some time and an ICZM action plan was completed in \n2010. While the ICZM plan is helpful in considering and planning issues and strategies \nin  an  integrated  fashion,  the  main  challenge  remains  putting  into  practice  and \nimplementing specific action plans (WTO 2013). \n3.2.2.2  The COAST Project \nIt is critical to ensure that tourism management is accompanied by adequate measures \nto mitigate its negative environmental and social effects. The case of the COAST project \nillustrates this approach. This project covers nine countries in Africa and focuses on \ncoastal communities. The two main outcomes of the project are expected to be: 1) \nsustainable tourism approaches for reducing environmental degradation from coastal \ntourism; and 2) public mechanisms supporting sustainable tourism governance and \nmanagement to enhance the adoption and implementation of best practices. \nThe  demo  site  in  Kenya  is  Watamu.  This  town  is  a  well-established  small  resort  \nof 20,000 inhabitants with a number of significant coastal hotels, tourism suppliers, good \nbeaches, and community tourism activity around a lagoon/forest. Kenya is currently \nimplementing  demonstration  projects  in  three  areas,  namely:  (i)  ecotourism;  \n(ii)  environmental  management  systems;  and  (iii)  reef  and  marine  recreation \nmanagement.  \nThe COAST project demo site in Kenya has focused on training and capacity-building \nworkshops  to  provide  the  required  support  for  implementation  of  the  project.  The \nmembers  have  also  planned  the  purchase  of  80  beehives  and  their  issuance  to \ncommunity groups involved in ecotourism. The project also provides financial support to \nenhance ecotourism activities (United Nations, ECA 2016b). \n3.2.2.3  Main Lessons \nThe main lessons from this case study are as follows. The ICZM approach constitutes a \nframework  contributing  to  sustainable  management  with  a  long-term  vision.  The \nprerequisites  for  successful  planning  and  implementation  are:  the  stakeholders\u2019 \ncollaboration,  crafting  and  implementing  small-scale  projects,  appropriate  linkages  \nof  various  activities,  suitable  governance  structures  and  management  processes.  \nThe challenges/weaknesses  needed  to  be  overcome  by local communities  include \nimprovement  of  engagement,  building  capacity,  mechanisms  of  monitoring  and \nperformance evaluation. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \n3.2.3  Marine Protected Area Parks, Hong Kong, China \nThis case from the PRC highlights the imperative to integrate tourism in sustainable \nmanagement of coastal zones. The strategic aim in marine protected areas is to seek a \ncustomized resource management approach (Mestanza-Ram\u00f3n et al. 2019). \n3.2.3.1  The Context: The Coastal Zone \nHong Kong, China is situated on the southern coast of the PRC and encompasses over \n260 islands. Some of the islands of Hong Kong, China offer a wide array of nature-based \nattractions. In Hong Kong, China, tourism constitutes a pillar of the economy and a \nsignificant factor in the transformation of the coastal environment. Hong Kong, China is \nendowed with natural resources that could be used for planning and management of \ncoastal tourism. It is believed that there is an imperative for an STM in order to ensure \nthat tourism will be environmental-friendly (Marafa 2008). \n3.2.3.2  Protected Area System: Marine Parks and Reserves \nThe local authorities planned and managed marine parks and reserves for protection \npurposes. Generally, protected maritime and coastal areas are increasingly used for \ntourism and recreation (Eagles, McCool, and Haynes 2002). \nMore access and visits to marine parks and reserves imply increasing pressure on \nresources. The institutional/regulatory framework in Hong Kong, China was established \nin  1995  with  the  aim  of  managing  sensitive  areas  of  the  marine  environment  for \npreservation and tourism and leisure ( \nThere  are  four marine  parks  and  one  marine  reserve  located  in various  areas  of \nHong Kong, China, covering zones with different geological structures, the largest being \n\u201cSha Chau and Lung Kwu Chau\u201d and Yan Chau Tong located in the west and northeast, \nrespectively (Marafa 2008).  \nThe increasing visitation of marine parks and reserves and related tourism activities puts \npressure and has a negative impact on marine biodiversity and habitats. It is felt that a \nframework for a multiple-use approach should be implemented in sustainably managing \nmarine parks (Marafa 2008). \n3.2.3.3  Main Lessons \nThe main lessons to take from this case are the following. The main aim for the creation \nof protected areas in coastal zones is to protect biodiversity without neglecting the \nincreased interest of social and economic dimensions (Maestro et al. 2019). However, \nthere is a need for a more integrated approach to incorporate STM into ICZM plans. \nPlans for tourism management should respect the natural resources and the local \npopulation in coastal areas. Tourism management plans should be sensitive to local \nstakeholders\u2019 expectations. These plans should be crafted and managed based on all \ncritical elements and dimensions \u2012 economic, environmental, and social \u2012 that tourism \nactivities involve. It is not only about a \u201cprotected\u201d status for a marine zone; the main \nchallenge is sustainable management to achieve desired outcomes. \n3.2.4  Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia \nThis  case  focuses  on  sustainable  management  strategies  in  protected  natural \nenvironments. It discusses the strategies for effective and efficient partnerships between \ntourism activities and environmentally sensitive areas (Jamal and Stronza 2009). \n \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \n3.2.4.1  Short Description  \nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP), which was established in 1975, was one \nof  the  world\u2019s  first  marine  parks.  The  GBR  World  Heritage  Area  accommodates  \n1.8  million  visitor  days  and  2.3  million  passenger  transfers  each  year  (GBRMPA \n2019). The  GBRMP  Authority  (GBRMPA)  employs  a  range  of  regulatory tools  and \nmanagement plans to ensure that tourism is managed in a sustainable manner.  \nThis case  highlights the key strategies  of the  GBRMPA  in managing tourism  and  \nits  leadership  in  balancing  tourism  development  with  environmental  protection. \nDetailed information on the GBR can be obtained through the interactive spatial tool \n(http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/). \n3.2.4.2  Tourism and Management Strategies  \nThe key underlying principle of the GBRMPA approach is that a protected area and \ntourism activities could and should coexist in a mutually beneficial pairing creating a \npositive impact in both fields. Stakeholder management and collaborative partnerships \nare regarded as central to the achievement of sustainable tourism on the GBR (Jamal \nand Stronza 2009; Briggs et al. 2013). These partnerships have the following benefits: \n1) they are mutually beneficial to all stakeholders; 2) active engagement in all activities \nwith a focus on shared knowledge; and 3) learning and open communication. \nThe engagement with, and consultation of, stakeholders is carried out through effective \nmechanisms and platforms allowing shared expertise and competencies among involved \nstakeholders. These mechanisms facilitate the achievement of a shared vision and \ninterests,  while  at the same time contributing to  addressing  potential conflicts  and \nproblems. It is worth noting that an Environmental Management Charge (EMC) paid by \nvisitors through tourism suppliers is the principal source of funding of the GBR Park. \nNowadays, the GBRMP is facing the challenges of climate change with limited financial \nresources.  Thus,  it  is  important  to  facilitate  suitable  partnerships  and  appropriate \ncommunication with tourism operators in order to foster stewardship (Morrison 2019).  \nA series of tourism- and leisure-related activities on the GBR have developed (e.g., \nrecreational and game fishing, snorkeling and diving, whale and dolphin watching), with \nnegative impacts on the GBR. That is the reason why management strategies have been \nelaborated to minimize the impacts of these activities. Hence, the GBRMPA succeeds in \npromoting  tourism  while  simultaneously  protecting  marine  life  resources  through \ncollaborative  sustainable  practices  to  manage  sustainable  tourism  experience \nopportunities that create positive outcomes for all stakeholders (Sigala 2013). At the \nsame time, management can measure the progress made. The two main challenges are: \n(i)  minimizing/mitigating  the  negative impacts  of tourism  activities  by implementing \nsustainable  practices;  and  (ii)  designing  and  implementing  a  comprehensive  crisis \nmanagement strategy to address unforeseen emergencies and crises, such as accidents \nand natural phenomena.  \n3.2.4.3  Main Lessons \nThe main lessons to take from this case are the following. Tourism can play an important \nrole  in  the  preservation  of  marine  protected  areas  and  collaboration  is  \na  cornerstone  concept  in  the  management  of  relationships  between  tourism  and \nenvironmental  protection.  Suitable  strategies  and  effective  mechanisms  include \nparticipative forms and consultation to achieve a balance between the needs of tourists \nand the environment; as well as local and regional alliances and partnerships to create \nbenefits for all stakeholders. \n \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \n4.  DISCUSSION: MAIN LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCES \nAND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS \nThe sustainable management of coastal and maritime tourism is of critical importance \nwithin the context of the Blue Economy framework and is an imperative due to the \nmultifaceted challenges and issues. The only strategy to surmount these challenges is \nto have a multidisciplinary approach to resource management (UNEP 2009; Coastal and \nMarine 2016). Based on the synoptic discussion of case studies from different regions \naround  the  world,  this  paper  argues  that  there  are  some  lessons  to  take  from \nexperiences. \n4.1  Main Lessons: A Synopsis \nThe most important lessons learned from the four case studies are outlined hereafter. \nFirst, there  is  a  requirement  to take  a  broad  holistic  perspective to  ICZM  due  to  \nthe complexity and diversity of factors influencing coastal zones. Collection and analysis \nof intelligence regarding local conditions is required to achieve this goal. Second, there \nis  a  need  for  long-range  planning  that  ensures  that  management  \nplans will have short-, medium-, and long-term positive impacts on coastal zones. Third, \nadaptive management, a flexible approach to developing and implementing ICZM plans, \nshould be used. Fourth, participative planning is required involving the collaboration of \nall  stakeholders  in  all  stages  of  ICZM  plans,  from  the  design  through  to  the \nimplementation. The last lesson is that effective implementation of ICZM also involves \nsuitable use of a range of tools and mechanisms (Maccarrone, Filiciotto, and Buffa 2014). \nIn order to achieve an STM within the context of the Blue Economy, the following \nconsiderations, aims/objectives, and actions are needed, classified into three areas. \nApproaches: Tourism can play an important role in the protection and preservation  \nof coastal zones. The Blue Economy, along with the ICZM approach, provides the \nappropriate framework for an intersectoral approach linking all sectors together in coastal \nzones and for sustainable planning and management. \nManagement Strategies: Strategy  and  action  plans  are  very  useful.  Collaboration \namong  all  stakeholders  contributes  to  the  success  of  projects.  Stakeholders\u2019 \ninvolvement,  engagement,  and  consultation  are  a  must.  Participative  forms  and \nconsultation  contribute  to  achieving  a  balance  between  tourists\u2019  needs  and  the  \nnatural environment. Governance and management structures should be strengthened \nto  ensure  that  tourism  serves  as  a  driver  contributing  to  preserving  the  natural \nenvironment,  to  mitigating  its  negative  impact,  and  to  boosting  the  prosperity  of  \nlocal populations. Governance mechanisms among and within tourism industries should \nbe  improved  to  enable  proper  planning,  monitoring,  and  regulation.  Appropriate \ngovernance structures and coordination mechanisms should be established for effective \nmanagement, as should a stakeholder network for promoting collaborative sustainable \npractices and coordination. \nImplementation: Control, Progress Monitoring, and Evaluation of Results: The \npractical implementation of the ICZM approach should be accepted and recognized. \nForming and operating suitable local/regional partnerships is an efficient tool. Progress \nshould be monitored and the resulting benefits should be measured and evaluated. \nThere  is  no  robust  evidence  of  measurement  of  the  progress  made  from  the \nimplementation of plans, with the GBR constituting the only exception. Lastly, there is a \nneed to developing a set of indicators to measure the outcomes and to disseminate best \npractices.  \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \nThe above-outlined lessons confirm the suggestions and recommendations formulated \nby related tourism and environment literature (e.g. Dowling and Pforr 2009; UNEP 2009; \nWTO 2013; Coastal and Marine 2016; EU 2018; Tonazzini et al. 2019). They also point \nout  the  imperative  for  an  integrated  framework  for  coastal  management.  Most \nimportantly, the best and the most useful lesson to take from the analysis of case studies \nis that the main concern and focus should be on implementation of plans. In other words, \nto recall Elliot, \u201cmanagement decisions are not worth the paper they are written on unless \nthe policies and decisions are implemented\u2026 through appropriate plans\u201d (Elliot 1997, \n97). \nThe literature and experiences also indicate the determining elements for achieving \neffective/successful implementation. \n4.2  Critical Success Factors for Successful Implementation \nThe previous discussion on practical experiences of implementation have demonstrated \nthat a series of factors are very important to the effective implementation of projects \n(WTO 2013; Coastal and Marine 2016; Tonazzini et al. 2019). \nThe study\u2019s focus is on the specific CSFs for the implementation stage of coastal and \nmaritime tourism plans in the context of sustainable management. The implementation \nis  absolutely  essential,  sine  qua  non.  The  most  important  elements  of  successful \nimplementation of these plans are: \n\u2022  Setting priorities and providing a focal point.  \n\u2022  Crafting specific action plans to help to achieve specific goals.  \n\u2022  Establishing suitable collaborative forms and competent project teams. \n\u2022  Ensuring  sustainable  operations,  providing  socioeconomic  benefits  to  all \nstakeholders with fair distribution. \n\u2022  Setting  proper  arrangements  and  committing/dedicating  sufficient  financial \nresources.  One  of  the  most  successful  examples  (GBRMP,  Australia) \ndemonstrated substantial investment in support of implementation. \n\u2022  Attaining the involvement and active participation of local stakeholders. \n\u2022  Monitoring progress in a comprehensive way with adequate tools and indicators.  \n\u2022  Assessing performance and outcomes through specific metrics to demonstrate \nthe benefits to all stakeholders involved and gain their continuous support. \n\u2022  Using quantitative instruments and assessment tools to evaluate performance \nand impacts.  \n\u2022  Increasing awareness along with progress by educating the local population, \nindustry operators, and visitors.  \n\u2022  Utilizing  available  technologies  for  various  purposes  (decision-making, \nmonitoring, evaluating).  \n\u2022  Taking advantage of, and benefiting from, best practices and know-how. \n \nThe  above  elements  are  all  essential  to  effective  and  successful  implementation  \nof plans. \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \n5.  CONCLUSION: IMPLICATIONS AND STUDY\u2019S \nLIMITATIONS \nThis  paper  adopted  a  supply/coastal  zone  perspective  to  explore  the  sustainable \nmanagement of coastal tourism within the general context of the Blue Economy. It  \nhas discussed some STM plans in coastal zones by focusing on the lessons that we can \ntake from experiences. The main research question was: \u201cWhat lessons could we take \nfrom practical experiences?\u201d A related question was: \u201cWhat are the critical factors for \neffective implementation?\u201d The question was addressed by applying the method of case \nstudy analysis.  \nFirstly,  a  literature  review  was  performed  aimed  at  outlining  the  main  issues  and \nchallenges to address in the field of coastal tourism management and at highlighting the \nimperative of adopting an integrated management approach. The paper indicated that \nICZM  is  a suitable  tool  for  achieving  sustainable management  of coastal  tourism, \nhighlighting the main elements of STM and governance. \nThis  was  followed  by  a synoptic  presentation  and  discussion  of four case  studies  \non plans and projects in the field of integrated management of coastal areas with a \nspecial focus on coastal and maritime tourism management. These case studies were \ndrawn from diverse situations and contexts, demonstrating the varying settings and \ncircumstances of coastal zones. It has been possible to glean lessons from each case in \nterms  of  planning  approaches,  management  processes,  and  strategies  for  coastal \ntourism  management,  as  well  as  the  essential  factors  determining  their  effective \nimplementation.  It  is  believed that  really  effective management  of coastal/maritime \ntourism  is  hard  to  achieve  and  the  implementation  of  related  plans  is  a  required \nmanagement function. Then, the main lessons to take from the practice and the CSFs \nfor efficient implementation of such projects were outlined. \nIt is believed that this study can make a contribution to the body of knowledge. Firstly, \nfrom  a  theoretical  perspective,  it  extends  the  knowledge  and  provides  a  deeper \nunderstanding of specific issues and challenges regarding the implementation of coastal \nand  maritime  tourism  plans  in  the  context  of  sustainable  management  and  \nthe Blue Economy. A series of concrete and precise elements, essential to take into \nconsideration  in  managing  and  implementing  these  plans,  were  indicated  and \nhighlighted.  These  suggestions  extend  and  strengthen  the  4Cs  approach  initially \npostulated  by  Owen,  Witt,  and Gammon (1993)  in  the  field  of sustainable  tourism \ndevelopment. The 4Cs reflect the extent to which a governance structure/body should \nachieve four aims simultaneously, namely compromise (by attaining a balance between \ntourism management and environmental conservation); commitment (by recognizing \nthat  sustainable  coastal  tourism  management  requires  implementation  and  action  \nand less discourse; cooperation (by recognizing the need for partnership at various \nlevels); and control (by setting a framework for effective regulation, monitoring, and \nperformance evaluation). Our study envisages this approach as a suitable framework for \nsustainable  coastal  tourism  management  and  puts  the  emphasis  on  efficient  and \neffective  implementation.  It  suggests  two  additional  Cs,  standing  for  coordination  \n(by attaining a shared vision, strategy, and action plans between all stakeholders) and \ncommitment two (by dedicating sufficient human and financial resources).  \nSecondly, the study\u2019s findings provide management implications. The implementation \nstage is of critical importance \u2012 the biggest challenge for industry practitioners in the field \nof coastal/maritime  tourism.  The suggested  framework  of  CSFs  and  guidelines for \nimplementation of STM plans is of practical importance and very useful in attaining \neffectiveness and efficiency in related projects in coastal zones. These factors point to \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \nand emphasize the deployment of appropriate management tools and techniques in \nperforming the required functions and attaining the desirable outcomes. \nFinally, it is worth acknowledging the limitations that our study encompasses. The study \nhas the inherent limitations/drawbacks of a qualitative research project. The number of \ncases is relatively limited and they were selected based on specific criteria, one being \nthe availability of data. Another study might have chosen a different set of cases. \nFurthermore, the cases are based on secondary research by authors. A cross-case \nanalysis was also used for an integrated overview of related issues and aspects and to \ndraw upon a series of lessons as conclusions. It is worth noting that the cases represent \nsnapshots  of  reality,  which  is  dynamic  and  evolving.  That  is  the  reason  why  the \nconclusions cannot be robust. There is no validation of generalization of the lessons \nlearned from this study. Therefore, there is a need for more research by scholars and \nincreased dissemination of best practices by industry practitioners alike. \n   \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1174  Sotiriadis and Shen \n \nREFERENCES \nBoteler, B. 2014.
