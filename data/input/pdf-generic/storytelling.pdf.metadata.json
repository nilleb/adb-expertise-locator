First,  it  enables  articula-\ntion  of  emotional  aspects  as  well  as  factual  content,  allow-\ning expression of tacit knowledge (that is always difficult to \nconvey). Second, by providing the broader context in which knowledge arises, it increases \nthe potential for meaningful knowledge-sharing. Third, by grounding facts in a narrative \nstructure, it augments the likelihood that learning will take place and be passed on. Pur-\nposeful storytelling can deliver results that conventional,  abstract modes of communica-\ntions such as those mentioned earlier cannot. Anyone can use it and become better at using \nit to reach many rapidly.\n\nCommunicating Naturally\nThe age-old practice of storytelling is one of the most effective tools that people can use. \nStorytellers communicate naturally: analysis might excite the mind but it does not offer an \neasy route to the heart, which is where one must go to motivate people. Working with stories \nis one of the best ways to\n\u2022  Make abstract concepts meaningful.\n\u2022  Help connect people and ideas.\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Give breathing space and allow different perspectives to emerge.\n\u2022  Create sense, coherence, and meaning.\n\u2022  Develop  valuable  descriptions  of  the  situations  in  which  knowledge  is  applied  and \n\nInspire imagination and motivate action.\n\nsolutions are found.\n\n\u2022  Examine organizational values and culture.\n\u2022  Communicate complex messages simply.\n\u2022  Operate effectively in networks.\n\u2022 \n\nInspire change.\n\n\fKnowledge \nSolutions\n\nTable 1: The Difference Between a Report and a Story \n\nVersion A\n\nVersion B\n\nIn our evaluation of a project in Bangladesh, we noted a wide \nvariance in the competence of individual villages to develop \nsustainable and effective solutions to problems encountered, \nfor example in replacing broken parts or developing low-cost \nproducts such as new latrines. The lessons to be learned from this \nevaluation are that we should:\n\u2022  work against over-dependence on development partners,\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nnote and encourage entrepreneurial approaches to problems,\nidentify existing and repeatable good practices,\nbuild and strengthen communication between villages to assist \ncross-fertilization of ideas at the grassroots level.\n\nBangladesh is a really impressive place\u2026 in a positive sense.  \nI was in a village last year working in water and sanitation.  \nWe were trying to promote the use of improved latrines, but \ncould not produce concrete slabs and rings locally for a low cost. \nSomebody told me to visit the latrines of a lady in the village,  \nso I went along and said, \u201cCan I see your latrines?\u201d She had made \na latrine out of a clay pot with the bottom cut off. Then, with a \npotter from the area, she developed a small local production of \nbottomless pots, and they became the latrines. Ingenious.\n\nA few weeks later I was in another village and saw a hand \npump; it was broken, just a small piece missing. So I said to the \nvillagers, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you repair your pump?\u201d And they said, \n\u201cOh, we just wait for another donor to bring a new pump.\u201d So I \nsaid, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you visit the lady in the village over there? She \nfinds ways of getting things done for herself.\u201d\n\nSource: Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. 2005. Story Guide: Building Bridges Using Narrative Techniques.

In some working contexts, storytelling will require patience and management \nbacking for a long time.\n\nFurther Reading\nSteve Denning\u2019s website.
