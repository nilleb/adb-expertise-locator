Narasimha Rao\n\nSubhashish Gupta\n\nIntroduction\n\nIndependent  regulation  has  emerged  in  the  last  two  decades  as  a\nfourth  branch  of  government.  This  movement  has  been  propelled  by\nthe  privatization  of  state-owned  resources  worldwide,  particularly  in\ninfrastructure sectors. Countries have instituted or contemplated \u2018new-\nstyle\u2019 independent regulatory authorities (IRA) to catalyze the movement\ntoward private sector involvement through competition or privatization.\nOver forty countries have set up regulators in the last decade.\n\nIndependent regulatory agencies have been set up in India for electri-\ncity and telecommunications in the last seven years. A semi-autonomous\ntariff regulator was established for ports in 1997. Establishing regulators\nin  petroleum,  natural  gas,  aviation,  and  rail  industries  is  also  being\nconsidered.  In  parallel,  India  has  also  established  the  Competition\nCommission  of  India  (CCI)  under  the  Competition  Act,  2002,  for\nregulation of industry in general. The overlap between the central and\nsectoral  regulators  is  as  yet  unexplored.  Thus,  the  Indian  regulatory\nlandscape is complex and formative.\n\nRegulation  of  infrastructure  industries  entails  managing  a  mix  of\nmonopolies  and  markets,  and  guiding  industry  transformation  and\ninvestment while protecting consumer interests. In these initial years of\nregulatory experience, the general perception is that regulatory agencies\nhave had little positive influence on sectoral growth and development.\n\n\fThe causes are complex and sector-specific but include lack of regulator\nindependence,  credibility,  enforcement  authority,  and  accountability.\nFuture  economic  development  will  depend  on  improving  regulatory\nefficacy, especially with independent regulators being contemplated in\nother vital industries.\n\nTwo aspects of independent regulation are reviewed here: institutional\nefficacy,  including  primarily  autonomy,  capacity,  and  accountability;\nand  the  mode  of  regulation,  or  the  regulator\u2019s  functional  scope.  The\nrecommendations are, by and large, concerned with regulatory process,\nincluding  member/staff  selection,  rulemaking,  and  appeals  but  also\nconsider the role of the executive and legislative intervention therein.\nIssues of structure are also addressed: Should regulators be independent\nor tied to ministries? Should there be sector-specific or broader, central\nregulators?\n\nRole of Regulation\n\nRegulation broadly defines mechanisms of government intervention in\nindustry. Typically, regulation entails intervention in price, entry, market\nstructure, procurement, and quality. Regulation has always implied the\nexistence,  usually  exclusively,  of  private  ownership  in  the  regulated\nindustries, and is primarily meant to mitigate market failure. Many infra-\nstructure sectors will continue to be monopolies\u2014electricity distribution,\nroads, and ports. Sectors that have scope for price-based competition\u2014\nelectricity  generation,  telecom,  oil,  and  gas\u2014have  incumbents  with\ndominant positions. Market abuse in both cases is possible, and requires\nregulation. Since incumbents are state owned and have clout in ministries,\nthe regulators need to be independent from the politicians/bureaucracy.\nIRAs spread worldwide along with privatization and liberalization of\ninfrastructure industries in complex circumstances. These reforms could\nbe  attributed  to  disenchantment  with  public  sector  ownership  as  also\ndue to conditionalities associated with World Bank/International Monetary\nFund (IMF) lending. In India this came about in the aftermath of the\nfiscal  crisis  of  1990-91.  Initially,  the  private  sector  was  invited  into\npower, telecom, roads, and other sectors through executive policy\u2014tax\nand  duty  incentives,  special  purpose  vehicles,  and  memoranda  of\nunderstanding  (MoUs).  In  the  late  1990s  IRAs  were  established  in\ntelecom, electricity, and ports, though the Tariff Authority for Major\n\nPorts  (TAMP)  is  really  a  semi-autonomous  regulator.  IRAs  may  have\nbeen a rational choice by host governments to signal their commitment\nto privatization, as also to insulate private entrants from the interests of\npredominating state-owned incumbents\u2014examples in India being Bharat\nSanchar  Nigam  Limited  (BSNL)  and  state  electricity  boards  (SEBs).\nIRAs  may  also  have  been  part  of  the  reform  framework  pushed  by\nlending  institutions  to  protect  private  investors  from  the  risk  of  asset\nexpropriation by government through tariff setting.\n\nInterest group politics and \u2018producer protection\u2019 has been part of the\nIndian regulatory experience. In Orissa the experiment included retail\nprice  increases  for  nine  years,  with  little  benefit  to  consumers.  Thus,\nlooking forward, with the extent of capture possible, regulation in India\nmust balance risk allocation between private investors and consumers.\nRegulators also need to strongly consider distributive impacts of growth on\nconsumers, particularly urban vs. rural. Urban teledensity in India stands\nat 18 per 100 persons, and rural teledensity at less than 2 per 100.\n\nAnother challenge for regulation in India beyond managing private\ninvestment is that for the next five to ten years the state-level regulatory\nsystem  will  be  concerned  largely  with  regulating  state-owned  utilities.\nElectricity restructuring has been limited to unbundling and corporat-\nization in some states. Also, the largest telecom operator BSNL is likely\nto remain in government hands in the foreseeable future. In nonservice\ninfrastructure,  most  road  and  port  assets  will  continue  to  be  held  by\ngovernments.

Thereafter, the CERC was set\nup  to  regulate  interstate  commerce  and  centrally  owned  generation\npursuant  to  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commissions  Act,  1998  (ERC\n98).  Subsequently,  states  have  been  slow  to  set  up  state  electricity\nregulatory commissions (SERCs) to regulate intra-state distribution and\nsupply. Sixteen (out of twenty-eight) states have set up SERCs, five of\nthem  pursuant  to  ERC  98  and  the  rest  pursuant  to  state  reform\nlegislation. Not all these can be considered fully functional SERCs, for\nseveral  reasons.  First,  many  state  governments  have  exercised  their\ndiscretionary right to grant specific powers (under Section 22.2 of ERC\n98). Some have not granted any (Himachal Pradesh) and several have\ndelegated a subset of these powers (Maharashtra, West Bengal).\n\nIn the established SERCs commitment to the regulatory function has\nbeen limited\u2014as reflected in the large number of vacancies (twenty-two\nreported in thirteen SERCs, more than half for longer than three months),\nlimited staff growth (on an average, eight to ten posts) and short tenure\n(average  of  two  to  three  years).  About  half  the  members are  retired\nfrom  civil  service  or  the  utility  and  almost  all  are  from  government\nagencies.  Two-thirds  of  the  staff  are  from  regulated  utilities,  most  of\nthem hired temporarily. This indicates that the regulators are perceived\nas extensions of bureaucracy. Overall, SERCs have failed to measurably\nimprove sector performance, have not gained the kind of respectability\ntheir counterparts in developed countries have, or public trust in safe-\nguarding public interest.\n\nAs discussed later, ministries intervene actively in regulatory affairs,\noften to invalidate their actions. State-owned utilities perceive them as\nmeddlesome.  In  one  case  (West  Bengal),  a  High  Court\u2019s  judgment\nextended into substantive aspects of the SERC\u2019s orders and even ques-\ntioned  the  value  of  involving  consumers  in  the  regulatory  process.\nAlthough  the  Supreme  Court  overturned  this  judgment,  this  case\nhighlights even the judiciary\u2019s disregard for regulators\u2019 independence.\n\nA clear indication of the political commitment to strengthening these\ninstitutions, however, is the Electricity Act, which has replaced ERC 98\nand all other legislation pertaining to the sector. The formation and func-\ntions of regulatory bodies have largely remained the same in the Electricity\nAct as in ERC 98. A notable change is that government\u2019s discretionary\ndelegation of powers to regulators has been discarded. SERCs\u2019 key func-\ntions include tariff setting, license issuance and enforcement, quality of\nservice monitoring, power purchase and resource planning, performance\nmonitoring, market development, and investment regulation.\n\nThe Electricity Act has retained the \u2018old-style\u2019 regulator, the Central\nElectricity  Authority  (CEA),  with  the  role  of  resource  planning  and\ntechnical  standard  setting  and  development.  Advisory  Committees  to\nadvise the SERCs, to be constituted from a broad range of stakeholders,\nhave also been provided for.\n\nTelecom\n\nSince independence the provision of telecommunication services had\nbeen  the  DOT\u2019s  preserve.

When the government invited bids for mobile\ntelephony the private sector responded with exuberance, and bid dispro-\nportionately  high  amounts  for  licenses.  Around  the  same  time  the\nTRAI, constituted through the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India\nAct,  1997,  came  out  with  its  first  telecom  tariff  order  in  a  bid  to\nrebalance telecom tariffs. As in other countries, local calling rates and\nrentals  were  being  cross-subsidized  by  long-distance  and  international\ncalls. The government had opened the local fixed-line segment to private\noperators  but  they  would  have  had  little  chance  of  success  while  the\nDOT kept prices in the segment artificially low. The DOT challenged\nthe  TRAI\u2019s  ruling,  claiming  that  tariffs  were  a  matter  of  policy  and\npolicymaking was the DOT\u2019s preserve. The government then issued a\npolicy directive to the TRAI to put the tariff rebalancing on hold.\n\nProblems regarding dispute resolution, defaults on license fees, and\ntardy progress in teledensity growth made the government take a fresh\nlook at the sector. Its new policy document, the New Telecom Policy,\n1999 (NTP 99), clarified the TRAI\u2019s powers and role. It also paved\nthe way for the introduction of competition into the long-distance and\ninternational segments. It removed dispute resolution from the TRAI\u2019s\nambit, creating the Telecom Disputes and Settlement Appellate Tribunal\n(TDSAT) for this specific function. On a number of issues, including\nlicensing, the TRAI would have a recommendatory role. In the aftermath\nof NTP 99 the DOT was bifurcated into operating and policymaking\nwings.  The  former  was  eventually  corporatized  to  form  BSNL.  The\nlong-distance  operator,  Videsh  Sanchar  Nigam  Limited  (VSNL),  was\nprivatized and sold to the Tatas.\n\nThe telecommunications sector recovered after the introduction of\nrevenue  sharing  and  mobile  services  have  now  overtaken  fixed-line\nservices.  The  sector  continues  to  witness  running  battles  between  the\nTRAI, DOT, and private operators; in most, the TRAI has come out\nsecond best. The focus of regulation has now expanded from telephony\nto a broad range of services, including internet, broadband, and voice\nover  internet  protocol  (VOIP).  The  government  recently  instituted\nunified licensing. The Communication Convergence Bill, awaiting parlia-\nmentary  approval,  proposes  a  single  regulator\u2014Communications\nCommission\u2014for communication and broadcasting services.\n\nOn the whole, telecommunications liberalization has achieved consider-\nable success, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The key challenges\nfor regulation moving forward are to harness technological change and\nopportunities, ensure sustainable competition, and extend the reach of\ntechnological opportunities and market into rural areas.\n\nOther Infrastructure Sectors\n\nIndependent  regulators  are  envisaged  for  airports,  oil  and  natural\ngas, and possibly railways. Independent regulation, however, is primarily\nmeant to mitigate the risk of private producers. An independent-style\nregulator may be a partial answer to such risks, but the setting up of\nproper legal frameworks and building the necessary competence is no\nmean task. It is worthwhile to explore other feasible institutional structures\nto achieve the goals of risk mitigation and protection of public interest.\nRegulatory  developments  in  these  sectors  include  setting  up  the\nTAMP. An airport regulatory authority has been recommended by the\nMinistry  of  Civil  Aviation  and  a  Petroleum  Regulatory  Board  by  the\nPetroleum Regulatory Board Bill (2002) to regulate the oil sector and\nnatural gas pipelines. A railway tariff regulator is being discussed. There\nis no indication of independent regulation in roads or water and sanitation.\n\nCritique of Regulatory Efficacy\n\nRegulatory Autonomy and Capture\n\nGiven government\u2019s continued dominance in infrastructure, are inde-\npendent regulators really workable? Even though ERC 98, and now the\nElectricity Act, empower regulators with substantial scope and decision-\nmaking authority, several loopholes undermine their authority. Populist\npolitical interference (e.g. free power to farmers) is one problem. State\nministries\u2019 desire to protect and control the incumbent utilities adds a\nnew dimension to capture possibilities, that by the government.\n\nSince  state-owned  utilities  provide  several  benefits  to  bureaucrats,\nthe reality pits the regulator directly against the government in influencing\nmanagement  decisions  of  the  utilities.  State  governments  have  often\nencouraged utilities to defy regulator rules and sometimes litigated against\nregulatory orders. Regulators are often reluctant to penalize state-owned\nenterprises  for  noncompliance.  When  they  do,  their  effectiveness  is\n\n6 Policy Brief No. 8\n\nRegulatory Framework for Infrastructure 7\n\n\fwith the prodding of multilateral agencies, contemplated a limited role\nfor the private sector in telecommunications in the National Telecom-\nmunications Policy, 1994.

It also paved\nthe way for the introduction of competition into the long-distance and\ninternational segments. It removed dispute resolution from the TRAI\u2019s\nambit, creating the Telecom Disputes and Settlement Appellate Tribunal\n(TDSAT) for this specific function. On a number of issues, including\nlicensing, the TRAI would have a recommendatory role. In the aftermath\nof NTP 99 the DOT was bifurcated into operating and policymaking\nwings.  The  former  was  eventually  corporatized  to  form  BSNL.  The\nlong-distance  operator,  Videsh  Sanchar  Nigam  Limited  (VSNL),  was\nprivatized and sold to the Tatas.\n\nThe telecommunications sector recovered after the introduction of\nrevenue  sharing  and  mobile  services  have  now  overtaken  fixed-line\nservices.  The  sector  continues  to  witness  running  battles  between  the\nTRAI, DOT, and private operators; in most, the TRAI has come out\nsecond best. The focus of regulation has now expanded from telephony\nto a broad range of services, including internet, broadband, and voice\nover  internet  protocol  (VOIP).  The  government  recently  instituted\nunified licensing. The Communication Convergence Bill, awaiting parlia-\nmentary  approval,  proposes  a  single  regulator\u2014Communications\nCommission\u2014for communication and broadcasting services.\n\nOn the whole, telecommunications liberalization has achieved consider-\nable success, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The key challenges\nfor regulation moving forward are to harness technological change and\nopportunities, ensure sustainable competition, and extend the reach of\ntechnological opportunities and market into rural areas.\n\nOther Infrastructure Sectors\n\nIndependent  regulators  are  envisaged  for  airports,  oil  and  natural\ngas, and possibly railways. Independent regulation, however, is primarily\nmeant to mitigate the risk of private producers. An independent-style\nregulator may be a partial answer to such risks, but the setting up of\nproper legal frameworks and building the necessary competence is no\nmean task. It is worthwhile to explore other feasible institutional structures\nto achieve the goals of risk mitigation and protection of public interest.\nRegulatory  developments  in  these  sectors  include  setting  up  the\nTAMP. An airport regulatory authority has been recommended by the\nMinistry  of  Civil  Aviation  and  a  Petroleum  Regulatory  Board  by  the\nPetroleum Regulatory Board Bill (2002) to regulate the oil sector and\nnatural gas pipelines. A railway tariff regulator is being discussed. There\nis no indication of independent regulation in roads or water and sanitation.\n\nCritique of Regulatory Efficacy\n\nRegulatory Autonomy and Capture\n\nGiven government\u2019s continued dominance in infrastructure, are inde-\npendent regulators really workable? Even though ERC 98, and now the\nElectricity Act, empower regulators with substantial scope and decision-\nmaking authority, several loopholes undermine their authority. Populist\npolitical interference (e.g. free power to farmers) is one problem. State\nministries\u2019 desire to protect and control the incumbent utilities adds a\nnew dimension to capture possibilities, that by the government.\n\nSince  state-owned  utilities  provide  several  benefits  to  bureaucrats,\nthe reality pits the regulator directly against the government in influencing\nmanagement  decisions  of  the  utilities.  State  governments  have  often\nencouraged utilities to defy regulator rules and sometimes litigated against\nregulatory orders. Regulators are often reluctant to penalize state-owned\nenterprises  for  noncompliance.  When  they  do,  their  effectiveness  is\n\n6 Policy Brief No. 8\n\nRegulatory Framework for Infrastructure 7\n\n\flimited,  since  financial  penalties  mean  little  to  state-owned  utilities.\nAlthough  state  governments  in  recent  years  have  ostensibly  imposed\nhard budget constraints, mostly they make good utilities\u2019 shortfalls.\n\nCapture by government also occurs through regulatory appointments.\nThird,  all  regulatory  commissions  are  funded  through  a  consolidated\nbudget, which gives the government control in staffing and growth.\n\nThus,  government  capture  of  the  SERC  occurs  from  above  (legal\nmandate or policy directives), below (by the utility, through information\nasymmetry or noncompliance), and within (by government-appointed\nmembers and staff).\n\nCapture with Privatization. A common perception is that privatization\nof  state-owned  utilities  is  a  necessary,  and  perhaps  only,  method  to\ndistance the regulator from government intervention. The creation of a\nconcession agreement or license to facilitate privatization, and in some\ncases  legislative  action,  offers  a  somewhat  clean  slate  in  defining  the\nrelationship between the regulator and the privatized utility. However,\nthe private entity can exploit this flexibility to distance itself from the\nregulator as well, benefiting from the regulator\u2019s susceptibility to govern-\nment  influence.  Specifying  in  the  privatization  contract  or  legislation\nthe  terms  of  private  sector  operation  minimizes  the  regulator\u2019s  role.\nIndeed,  negotiating  behind  closed  doors  itself  makes  the  regulators\nvulnerable to capture by private interests, tilting risk allocation in favor\nof  investors  and  against  consumers  or  government.  Capture  is  also\npossible  with  information  asymmetry  in  cost-plus  regulation,  where\nregulators  depend  unduly  on  regulated  entities  for  information  in\nrulemaking for private entities.\n\nCapture in Telecom. Regulator\u2019s capture by the private sector was\nwitnessed in the advent of Reliance Infocomm in basic services and its\n\u2018backdoor\u2019 entry into the mobility market.\n\nIn telecommunications government\u2019s possession of licensing powers\nreduces the TRAI\u2019s autonomy. The TRAI seems powerless to redress\nissues  about  interconnection  problems  that  most  private  operators\ncomplain  about.  The  method  of  selection  of  TRAI  chairperson  and\nmembers could also be more impartial and objective.\n\nWith licensing powers and the power to issue policy directives to the\nTRAI,  the  DOT  in  effect  regulates  the  TRAI.  As  such,  it  can  even\npursue policies conflicting with TRAI\u2019s positions to favor the incumbents.\n\nLooking  forward,  the  Convergence  Bill,  making  it  mandatory  for  the\ncommission  to  follow  government\u2019s  policy  directives,  also  ensures  an\navenue for DOT\u2019s influence.\n\nThe DOT itself is susceptible to private operators\u2019 lobbying, given its\n\nopaque decision-making.\n\nInformal Processes\n\nThree categories of capture mechanisms are seen: (a) exploitation or\nmisuse  of  policy  directives;  (b)  informal,  opaque  \u2018behind-the-scene\u2019\nprocesses that subvert procedure; and (c) flagrant flouting of procedure\nand law.\n\nExploitation or Misuse of Policy Directives. Policy directives to guide\nregulatory  function  are  often  necessary,  partly  to  plug  loopholes  and\nclarify ambiguities in the law, but also to ensure effective and consistent\napplication of the law across states. But the legal provisions for policy\nguidance  in  the  Indian  Electricity  Act  are  discretionary,  not  specific.\nAlso, these are binding on regulators and not judicable. The Electricity\nAct  states  that  Commissions  will  be  guided  by  government  policy\n(Sections  61,  66,  79,  86).  This  gives  the  ministry  wide  latitude  to\noverride regulatory decisions.\n\nThese provisions are often used to issue nonpolicy directives. Since\npolicy directives are legally binding, regulators may have to implement\npolicies that contradict their legal mandate. State governments promising\nfree power, for example, directly contradicts the regulators\u2019 mandate\nto bring tariffs toward the cost of supply. No legal recourse exists for\nthis loophole.\n\n\u2018Behind-the-Scene\u2019  Processes  that  Subvert  Procedure.\n\nInteractions\nbetween regulators and vested interests outside the scope of procedure\nand  law  are  hidden  from  the  public  domain.  For  instance,  ministries\noften appoint members of their choice, though the law (both ERC 98\nand  the  Electricity  Act)  lays  down  a  selection  process  involving  an\nappointed Selection Committee.

Regulators typically will not\nconfront the ministry, due in part to bonhomie and also due to their\nfinancial dependence on the ministry. Regulatory agencies should not\nbe  funded  through  a  consolidated  budget  but  should  recover  costs\nthrough  a  consumer  fee.  For  example,  the  budget  of  the  Karnataka\nElectricity Regulatory Commission is currently around Rs. 3 crore. A\ncess of 1 paisa per unit (less than 0.5% of average tariff) would raise\nRs.  16  crore  per  annum.  The  Electricity  Act  permits  this.  TRAI  also\nhas mooted independent funding.

Acts of noncompliance,\nthough  judicable  are  not  sufficiently  punishable.  Imposing  penalties\ndirectly  on  officeholders  rather  than  on  the  SEB  would  encourage\naccountability. Regulators can assert their authority through summons\nof utility personnel and proactive searches and seizures in instances of\ninformation withholding. The TRAI also faced enforceability issues against\nBSNL  regarding  interconnection.  Private  operators  have  consistently\ndefaulted on rollout obligations despite financial penalties. For deficiency\nof  service  they  face  no  penalties.  For  rollout  obligations  either  more\nstringent penalties are required or alternative incentive-based mechanisms\nneed  to  be  developed.

Four  states\npermit  appeal  only  on  points  of  law.  In  most  states  orders  can  be\nappealed at the High Court on procedural, legal, and substantive grounds.\nCommissions entertain appeal petitions usually only on the basis of new\ninformation  or  clear  error.  In  addition,  regulators  have  to  file  annual\nreports before Parliament or the state legislature. Regulatory orders also\nface legislative review, subject to modification or annulment.\n\nIn practice, few SERCs regularly file annual reports. Filed reports are\ncryptic. But most importantly, the SERCs have not proactively asserted\ntheir authority. As discussed elsewhere, this is often due to their lack of\ncapacity, enforcement authority, or reluctance to challenge government\ninterference.\n\nThe government should establish rules or issue policy directives that\ndetail the reporting requirements. To make these enforceable, periodic\nreview of annual reports and orders is essential. However, the Electricity\nAct does not impose any penalties or permit overturning noncomplying\norders. In the least, repeated noncompliance should constitute grounds\nfor  penalties  incorporated  in  law.  Public  exposure  of  noncompliance\nwill  put  some  pressure  on  regulators.  Procedural  checks  and  balances\nmust also be incorporated into rulemaking, to minimize the scope for\nlitigation. There is also strong support in academic literature for rigorous\nregulatory procedure, as means to reduce capture and limit regulatory\ndiscretion. When interest groups drive regulatory decisions, there is a\ntendency to subvert procedure to expedite decisions and escape scrutiny.\nAn emphasis on transparent procedural rigor could enhance regulatory\nefficacy.\n\nPublic Participation in Rulemaking\n\nIn the US, all formal rulemaking (e.g. ratemaking) is participatory,\ninvolving hearings and scrutiny of regulated utility filings by any interested\nparty.  In  the  UK  consultative  model  full  information  disclosure  of\nregulators\u2019 rulemaking process is not obligatory, but a statutory consumer\norganization,  EnergyWatch,  represents  the  consumers\u2019  interests  and\ndisseminates information on regulatory matters.\n\nIn India\u2019s watered-down version of the UK regulatory system, rule-\nmaking is consultative but relatively ad hoc, with no formal consumer\n\nrepresentation. A few SERCs have consumer divisions to handle consumer\ngrievances and education. Independent consumer representatives have\nmade minimal intervention in the regulatory process (Karnataka, Andhra\nPradesh, Maharashtra). The efficacy of public intervention rests on two\ncritical  prerequisites:  information  and  capacity.  Although  SERCs  are\nrequired to publish whatever data they rely on for rulemaking\u2014including\ndata  submitted  by  utilities,  consultation  reports,  etc.\u2014this  is  only  on\npaper.  SERCs  need  to  be  much  more  proactive  in  releasing  such\ninformation,  with  user-friendly  websites,  well-organized  libraries,  and\ninformation management systems. SERCs also need to undertake regu-\nlator training programs in all areas of the power sector, but particularly\nin their rulemaking activities. Procedures for information maintenance,\ndisclosure  of  rulemaking  process,  reporting  procedures,  outreach  and\ntraining,  and  member  selection  need  to  be  codified  into  judicable\nprocedures.\n\nInstitutional Capacity\n\nAn  independent  regulator  is  expected  to  make  rules,  administer\nthem,  and  adjudicate  disputes.  Immune  to  lobbyists\u2019  influence,  it  is\nexpected  to  act  in  public  interest,  actively  engage  virtually  all  sector\nstakeholders in decision-making, and effectively interpret and carry out\na mandate based on a broad set of principles. Regulators need internal\nexpertise and capacity to carry out such a daunting mandate.\n\nAn SERC\u2019s average budget is about Rs. 3 crore and that of CERC is\nRs.  6  crore.  In  comparison,  the  US  FERC  budget  is  $120  million\n(Rs. 600 crore). The consumer base of a typical SERC is equivalent to\nthat of the UK or South Africa. The UK Office of Gas and Electricity\nMarkets (OFGEM) budget is $50 million (Rs. 250 crore) and that of\nSouth Africa is $8.5 million (Rs. 42 crore). Also, SERCs typically have\n20\u201330 total staff; the US and UK regulators have hundreds.\n\nRegulatory Scope and Function\n\nWe now look at the regulator\u2019s functional role in infrastructure sectors,\nincluding  tariff  regulation,  developing  markets  where  appropriate,\nprotecting  consumer  interests  through  quality  of  service  standards,\ncontract design and negotiation processes, and land acquisition.\n\n12 Policy Brief No. 8\n\nRegulatory Framework for Infrastructure 13\n\n\fAccountability of Regulators\n\nAccountability  currently  rests  on  an  appeals  process.

A few SERCs have consumer divisions to handle consumer\ngrievances and education. Independent consumer representatives have\nmade minimal intervention in the regulatory process (Karnataka, Andhra\nPradesh, Maharashtra). The efficacy of public intervention rests on two\ncritical  prerequisites:  information  and  capacity.  Although  SERCs  are\nrequired to publish whatever data they rely on for rulemaking\u2014including\ndata  submitted  by  utilities,  consultation  reports,  etc.\u2014this  is  only  on\npaper.  SERCs  need  to  be  much  more  proactive  in  releasing  such\ninformation,  with  user-friendly  websites,  well-organized  libraries,  and\ninformation management systems. SERCs also need to undertake regu-\nlator training programs in all areas of the power sector, but particularly\nin their rulemaking activities. Procedures for information maintenance,\ndisclosure  of  rulemaking  process,  reporting  procedures,  outreach  and\ntraining,  and  member  selection  need  to  be  codified  into  judicable\nprocedures.\n\nInstitutional Capacity\n\nAn  independent  regulator  is  expected  to  make  rules,  administer\nthem,  and  adjudicate  disputes.  Immune  to  lobbyists\u2019  influence,  it  is\nexpected  to  act  in  public  interest,  actively  engage  virtually  all  sector\nstakeholders in decision-making, and effectively interpret and carry out\na mandate based on a broad set of principles. Regulators need internal\nexpertise and capacity to carry out such a daunting mandate.\n\nAn SERC\u2019s average budget is about Rs. 3 crore and that of CERC is\nRs.  6  crore.  In  comparison,  the  US  FERC  budget  is  $120  million\n(Rs. 600 crore). The consumer base of a typical SERC is equivalent to\nthat of the UK or South Africa. The UK Office of Gas and Electricity\nMarkets (OFGEM) budget is $50 million (Rs. 250 crore) and that of\nSouth Africa is $8.5 million (Rs. 42 crore). Also, SERCs typically have\n20\u201330 total staff; the US and UK regulators have hundreds.\n\nRegulatory Scope and Function\n\nWe now look at the regulator\u2019s functional role in infrastructure sectors,\nincluding  tariff  regulation,  developing  markets  where  appropriate,\nprotecting  consumer  interests  through  quality  of  service  standards,\ncontract design and negotiation processes, and land acquisition.\n\n12 Policy Brief No. 8\n\nRegulatory Framework for Infrastructure 13\n\n\fRegulation of Competitive Markets\n\nElectricity Markets.\n\nIndia is in gradual transition toward competitive\nelectricity  markets.  The  movement  is  currently  focused  on  capacity\nexpansion. Retail competition has been deregulated (for large customers)\nbut not the wholesale market. The contemplated future market structure\nis a coordinated bilateral market with a regional system operator that\noversees system reliability and security. Recent proposals contemplate a\ngradually increasing obligation for new power plants to sell their capacity\non a merchant basis.\n\nTypically, two functions are necessary for any new market to emerge:\nmarket  design  and  development;  and  market  power  mitigation.  The\nElectricity Act already has slated market design and development as a\ntask  of  the  regulatory  commissions,  which  they  have  begun.  Appro-\npriately,  the  CERC  has  focused  on  bulk  supply  market  design,  while\nSERCs  are  tasked  with  implementing  the  rules  for  retail  open  access.\nThe  CERC  alone  must  develop  the  appropriate  market  structure,\nincluding retail market development and implementation. Although states\nwould retain the scope to implement retail access, retail markets must\nbe  designed  along  with  bulk  supply  markets,  since  they  are  closely\nrelated,  and  would  benefit  from  consistent  and  uniform  application\nacross the country.\n\nTowards  evaluating  the  pace  of  competitive  market  development,\nCERC must undertake a broad-based consultative process. Consultation\npapers on markets contain inadequate assessment of the risks, options,\nand prerequisites for market development.\n\nTelecom Markets.\n\nIn a nascent telecom market, the primary concern\nin  market  development  is  the  incumbent\u2019s  dominant  position.  In  the\nlast  five  years,  BSNL\u2019s  monopoly  over  most  of  India\u2019s  customer  base\nrequired significant regulatory intervention into interconnection issues\nas  well  as  subsidies.  Today,  the  wireless  consumer  base  has  grown  to\nequal BSNL\u2019s 45 million fixed-line connections, with continued growth\nof up to 100% a year. Thus, the telecom market has developed much\nfarther than electricity market. There is a fairly healthy market in mobile\ntelephony.  In  basic  services\u2014local,  long-distance  and  international\u2014\nhowever,  the  market  continues  to  be  dominated  by  the  Mahanagar\nTelephone  Nigam  Limited  (MTNL),  BSNL,  and  VSNL,  even  though\nReliance  Infocomm,  Tata  Teleservices,  and  Bharti  are  making  their\npresence felt.\n\nTwo  issues  are  pertinent  to  market  development.  The  abuse  of\ndominance  by  the  incumbent  BSNL  in  providing  interconnection  has\nbeen discussed before. The second issue is the spate of mergers that the\nsector has witnessed, which raises competition policy issues. The DOT\nhas set guidelines for mergers after seeking TRAI\u2019s recommendations.\nThe CCI has its own rules for combinations. These may be in conflict,\nand  cause  excessive  and  confusing  litigation.  Market  power  issues  are\nbest  left  with  TRAI.  Similarly,  the  authority  in  charge  of  market\ndevelopment  ought  to  have  the  authority  to  award  licenses,  TRAI  in\nthis case. This would achieve a degree of consistency in the sector, as\nsuggested for the new Communications Commission. It will also ensure\nthat market developments are deliberated and promulgated through a\ntransparent regulatory process.\n\nA  tribunal  to  settle  disputes  in  telecommunications  is  unusual  but\nnot unique to India. The TDSAT, set up to speed up dispute resolution\nin telecom, has arbitrated a number of cases, though the speed of its\ndeliberations  could  pick  up  momentum.  The  TDSAT  operates  as  a\nspecial court and not as an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) body.\nIt would have been preferable to subsume dispute resolution within the\nTRAI, but then the chairperson of TRAI would have to be a judicial\nperson.  Therefore,  it  may  be  best  to  leave  the  TDSAT  as  it  is  with\nsome effort being made to speed up decisions through ADRs. It should\nalso harmonize its operations with the TRAI.\n\nMarket Power Monitoring\n\nCERC  should  anticipate  market  power  as  it  develops  competitive\nmarkets, even if such a market is restricted to \u2018managed competition\u2019\nfor  new  capacity.  This  includes  determining  what  constitutes  market\npower  abuse,  whether  and  how  it  should  be  monitored,  and  what\nmitigation and remedial measures should be adopted.

In the event, does the market-monitoring cell\nbelong in the CERC (sector-specific) or the CCI (centralized) or should\nit be shared between them? This issue has already arisen in telecom.

Thus, it is imperative that market monitoring in electricity and\ntelecommunications markets is legally clarified to be in the domain of\nCERC and TRAI respectively.\n\nRegulation of Electricity Distribution Monopolies\n\nChallenges for regulation in electricity distribution monopolies have\nbeen mostly observed at the state level. There are three areas of concern:\n(a)  the  trend  towards  privatization  with  contract  terms  stipulated  in\nlegislation; (b) the trend towards multi-year, performance-based tariffs;\nand (c) quality of service.\n\nSeeking Balanced Risk Allocation. The risks associated with regulation\nby contract/legislation are evident in the Delhi model and the proposed\n\nKarnataka design. Measures designed to safeguard investor returns and\nshield them from associated risks may induce investors to overcapitalize\nor  increase  operating  costs,  more  so  if  regulator  scrutiny  is  absent  or\nminimal. Until tariff setting is freed from the unpredictability of govern-\nment  intervention,  market  risk  mitigation  through  assured  returns  or\nprice would need to continue. However, privatization design needs to\nbuild in better safeguards for cost discipline and performance improve-\nment. For this, regulatory approval of capital expenditure and operating\ncosts is essential.\n\nMulti-year  Tariffs  and  Utility  Performance. Most  reform  related  to\nperformance  improvement  and  tariff  setting  has  focused  on  technical\nloss reduction and utility financial performance. The current trend has\nbeen to implement some form of multi-year tariff principles, along with\nperformance-based price regulation (along the lines of retail price index\nminus X (RPI\u2013X) in the UK). This is appropriate but the challenges are\nin implementation. Generally, the efficacy of performance-based regula-\ntion rests on two factors: the quality of performance targets and their\nenforceability. A good performance target encourages utilities to invest\nin  system  improvement  but  is  realistic  enough  to  be  implemented.\nEnforceability implies that utilities need to take these targets seriously.\nThis requires not only effective monitoring of utilities\u2019 performance but\nalso realistic penalties for failure.\n\nTo  develop  appropriate  (quality)  performance  targets,  regulators\nshould consider developing and using benchmarks. Regulators have begun\nto see realistic trends of loss reduction since ERC 98, which can be a\nstarting  point  for  developing  loss  reduction  trajectories.  A  critical\nprerequisite will be a transparent subsidy scheme. Unless utilities financials\nare clearly separated from subsidies, efforts to force operating efficiency\nimprovements will be handicapped.\n\nQuality of Service. Across all infrastructure sectors, with some excep-\ntions in telecom, both private and state-owned entities have little incentive\nto  improve  quality  of  service.  Indeed,  reduction  in  quality  of  service\nmay be desirable (to improve returns for private entities, and to reduce\nworkload for SEBs). Theory suggests two main incentives for quality provi-\nsion: competition and reputation. In monopoly industries competition\nis  absent.  As  regards  reputation,  most  state-owned  entities  care  little\nsince they have little accountability. For this reason, quality of service must\n\n16 Policy Brief No. 8\n\nRegulatory Framework for Infrastructure 17\n\n\finterpretation of noncompetitive behavior might lead to increased costs\nand  tardy  introduction  of  new  services.
