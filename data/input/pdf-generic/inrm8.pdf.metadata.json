Narasimha Rao\nSubhashish Gupta\nIntroduction\nIndependent regulation has emerged in the last two decades as a\nfourth branch of government. This movement has been propelled by\nthe privatization of state-owned resources worldwide, particularly in\ninfrastructure sectors. Countries have instituted or contemplated \u2018new-\nstyle\u2019 independent regulatory authorities (IRA) to catalyze the movement\ntoward private sector involvement through competition or privatization.\nOver forty countries have set up regulators in the last decade.\nIndependent regulatory agencies have been set up in India for electri-\ncity and telecommunications in the last seven years. A semi-autonomous\ntariff regulator was established for ports in 1997. Establishing regulators\nin petroleum, natural gas, aviation, and rail industries is also being\nconsidered. In parallel, India has also established the Competition\nCommission of India (CCI) under the Competition Act, 2002, for\nregulation of industry in general.
