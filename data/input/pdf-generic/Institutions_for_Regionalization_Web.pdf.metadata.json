Its mission is to help its developing \nN\nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. \nDespite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: \nT\n1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than  o\nw\n$1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth,  a\nr\nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. d\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main   a\nn\ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity   A\ns\ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.  ia\nn\n E\nc\no\nn\no\nm\nic\n C\no\nm\nAsian Development Bank\nm\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City u\nn\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nit\nwww.adb.org y\nISBN978-92-9092-210-0\nPublication Stock No. BKK090359 Printed in the Philippines", "INSTITUTIONS FOR \nREGIONAL INTEGRATION\nToward an Asian Economic Community", "\u00a9 2010 Asian Development Bank\nAll rights reserved.

economies,  significant \nprogress  in  integrating  them,  and  establishment  of \nvast linkages with the global economy are some of the \ngreatest  accomplishments  of  the  past  few  decades. \nMarket-led integration, backed by national efforts and \nregional collective actions, has brought shared prosperity to Asia and \nthe Pacific.\nAsian  integration  is  gaining  momentum  through  enhanced \ncooperation between governments, firms, and people. Today, the \nregion\u2019s  rapid  growth  is  marked  by  growing  cross-border  trade, \nfinancial flows, and movement of people. The region is integrating \nwithin itself and with the rest of the world. But the road ahead is long \nand full of challenges.\nAsia\u2019s approach has been pragmatic and flexible. It has followed \na bottom\u2013up process that supports subregional cooperation initiatives \nthrough a multitrack and multispeed approach, reflecting the diversity \nand heterogeneity of preferences in the region. This approach, which \nhas  been  sometimes  described  as  \u201cgradual,\u201d  has  allowed  both \ndeveloping and developed economies to participate in building a \nbroader and unified regional architecture.\nAsian integration is supported by a dense web of overlapping \nregional and subregional institutions that are largely intergovernmental \nand focus on specific functional goals. The great diversity of Asian \neconomies and societies poses challenges to the creation of regional \nstructures. Coupled with this is a reluctance to delegate authority to \nregional institutions.\nSome recent efforts to institutionalize policy cooperation have been \nsuccessful and must be lauded. The multilateralization of the Chiang \nMai Initiative, the setting up of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research \nOffice, and efforts to create a region-wide free trade area are concrete \nfirst steps to institutionalize Asia\u2019s policy cooperation initiatives.\nxii", "Foreword \nSo far, the existing institutions and arrangements have served the \nregion well. But the progress of regionalism has remained uneven \nacross subregions and thematic sectors. By most measures, East \nAsia is more extensively integrated than South Asia, Central Asia, or \nthe Pacific. As a result, across the region there is serious rethinking \nand discussion on the institutional framework needed to lock in \nthe realized gains and support the next steps for enhanced regional \ncooperation and integration.\nDo we need to create new institutions, strengthen existing ones, \nor even look at consolidation? What will be the governance structure \nof Asian institutions? Are we ready to create an Asia-wide institution \nand delegate some degree of sovereignty to it? What has been the \nexperience of other regions? What is the way forward?\nThis work is an attempt to answer these questions. It is the last in \na trilogy of studies undertaken jointly by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the ADB Institute analyzing the progress of integration to \nachieve our vision of an \u201cAsian economic community.\u201d This will not \nhappen overnight. Visions and dreams are realized by taking small, \nincremental steps. Thus the longer it takes, the sooner we must start.\nOur first study, Emerging Asian Regionalism\u2014A Partnership for \nShared Prosperity (ADB 2008b), identified strengthening the institutional \nbase for Asian integration and enhancing regional connectivity to \nboost production networks and trade as the next steps for creating \na stronger architecture for regional policy cooperation. The second \nstudy, Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia (ADB/ADBI 2009), looked in \ndepth at building physical infrastructure networks and institutions to \nsupport the region\u2019s rapid growth.\nThis third study looks at the institutional framework for regional \ncooperation and integration. It analyzes why, despite a dense network \nof arrangements and institutions, Asia remains \u201cinstitution light\u201d\u2014\nmarked by few formal or explicit commitments from member countries \nin terms of an agenda for cooperation. It lays out the general principles \nand options to strengthen the region\u2019s institutional architecture to \nachieve the goal of an Asian economic community.\nI wish to express deep appreciation to the excellent team of \nindividuals,  both  inside  and  outside  ADB  and  its  Institute,  who \ncontributed to preparing this study. It is the joint work of several \nexperts  who  served  as  authors,  advisers,  reviewers,  editors,  and \ntechnical staff. Jong-Wha Lee, Srinivasa Madhur, Giovanni Capannelli, \nand Sabyasachi Mitra developed the study concept and implemented \nthe project.

Masahiro Kawai \nand Rajat M. Nag provided overall guidance and strategic direction \nto the study.\nThe emergence of Asian regionalism is a powerful historical force \nthat will help build peace and prosperity within and outside the region. \nBuilding the right institutional framework for Asian integration is not \nonly important for the region to eradicate poverty and sustain the \ngrowth momentum, but it is also good for the rest of the world as Asia \nincreases its contribution to the global economy.\nHaruhiko Kuroda\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\nxiv", "Acknowledgments \nT\nhis study draws inspiration from ADB President Haruhiko \nKuroda\u2019s vision of a truly integrated and globally connected \nAsia.

This \nemerging  Asian  regionalism  offers  a  new  platform  for  economic \ndevelopment that is, as the predecessor to this report, Emerging Asian \nRegionalism: A Partnership for Shared Prosperity (ADB 2008b), put it, \n\u201cgood for individual economies, good for Asia, and good for the world.\u201d\nThis  remarkable  achievement  now  needs  entrenching  and \nextending\u2014as  is  already  starting  to  happen.  Interdependence  is \ndeepening. Cross-border trade in parts and components continues \nto rise, as economies such as Viet Nam\u2014like the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  (PRC)  before  them\u2014develop  manufacturing  assembly \noperations  and  connect  up  with  regional  supply  chains.  This \nintraregional trade in intermediate goods is increasingly supplemented \nby trade in final goods too, as consumption growth accelerates. Foreign \ndirect investment flows within Asia are also rising fast. \n1  The geographical coverage of this study is defined by ADB\u2019s regional membership, which \nincludes 48 countries that are part of the \u201cAsia and the Pacific\u201d region. The complete list of \ncountries covered in this study is shown in Table 2.1 in Chapter 2. Countries are grouped \ninto five subregions: Central Asia, South Asia, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the \nPacific, including Oceania. It is often helpful to consider Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia \ntogether as East Asia.\n2", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \nThese developments are mostly a result of market forces allied \nwith liberalizing national policies. As governments have opened up \nnational economies, abundant supplies of low-skilled labor in some \ncountries have combined with highly skilled labor and manufacturing \ncapabilities in others to stimulate trade and investment. Falling transport \nand communication costs have deepened these intraregional links.\nAsia\u2019s integration is thus more a spontaneous outcome of national \npolicy initiatives and technical change than the result of a grand scheme \nto create a single market for the region. While \u201ctop\u2013down\u201d policy \ncooperation on trade, investment, finance, and other issues has been \nimportant, Asia\u2019s integration has mostly come from the bottom up. \nThe vigor of this largely organic\u2014and visibly positive\u2014process \nnow creates four challenges for policy-makers.\n\u2022  Cementing recent gains. Although Asia\u2019s economic growth \nhas been very rapid, recent achievements are fragile. The \nregion\u2019s beneficial openness to the rest of the world also has \nits downsides, not least a vulnerability to external shocks. The \ncollapse of trade and financial flows in the 2008/09 crisis was \na reminder of this. While Asian governments did not succumb \nto the temptation to restrict trade and investment, the crisis \nunderscores  the  need  to  buttress  economic  and  financial \nstability to consolidate recent gains. Moreover, while regional \neconomic cooperation has progressed in recent years, existing \nobligations and commitments have yet to be implemented \nuniformly across Asia and the Pacific. \n\u2022  Broadening the process. Until now, Asian economic integration \nhas mostly focused on East Asia: \u201cFactory Asia\u201d is primarily an \nEast Asian operation. While trade between South and East Asia\u2014\nnotably between India and the PRC\u2014is growing, not all parts \nof those regions, and not all sectors and activities, are equally \ninvolved. Whereas almost 60% of East Asia\u2019s trade in parts and \ncomponents takes place within the region, intraregional trade \nshares are very low in Central and South Asia, and in the Pacific. \nSince intraregional trade\u2014in intermediate goods in particular\u2014\ncan be an important driver of growth, its benefits now need to be \nextended throughout those three subregions.\n\u2022  Deepening integration. The next steps in regional integration \ninvolve moving from integrated trade and production networks \nto more deeply integrated goods markets by lifting behind-the-\nborder barriers to trade and competition; removing obstacles \nto interregional trade in services; allowing a freer movement \nof labor, especially skilled labor, across regional members; \n3", "Institutions for Regional Integration\ndeveloping deeper, wider, and more crisis-resilient financial \nmarkets in Asia that are able to allocate the region\u2019s vast \n(often externally invested) savings more efficiently to its huge \ninvestment needs and thus facilitate global rebalancing; and \ncoordinating monetary and fiscal policies more closely in order \nto enhance macroeconomic and exchange-rate stability. Last \nbut not least, they involve reducing poverty, shrinking income \ndisparities, and boosting investment and growth in the less \ndynamic economies across Asia and the Pacific. The end result \nwould be the creation of an \u201cAsian economic community,\u201d \ncomplete with a new regional architecture that would include \nfully integrated markets and stronger regional institutions.\n\u2022  Ensuring the compatibility of regional and global integration. \nAsia, especially East Asia, is the paradigmatic open region, \nand its approach to cooperation is one of \u201copen regionalism\u201d \n(Garnaut 1996). Since Asia is highly integrated globally as well \nas regionally, it is crucial that measures to cement the region\u2019s \nintegration complement rather than jeopardize its links with \nthe rest of the world.\n1.1. Need for Institutions\nThe premise of this study is that these four challenges cannot be met by \nrelying on market processes and national action alone\u2014Asian countries \nwill  also  have  to  work  together  effectively.  That  demands  norms, \nrules, and understandings about how to proceed, as well as regional \norganizations to coordinate governments\u2019 actions. In short, it requires \ninstitutions for regional integration (IRIs), which are defined in Box 1.1.\nAsia and the Pacific hardly lack IRIs\u2014this study counts a total of 40. \nBut while the region possesses a dense web of such institutions, these \nvary enormously in scope and structure, since\u2014like Asian integration \nitself\u2014they  have  developed  in  response  to  specific  needs  rather \nthan by grand design. Some are overarching organizations: umbrella \narrangements with comprehensive purviews, which convene summits \nfor heads of government or state and/or ministerial-level meetings, \nand provide the normative and declaratory frameworks that legitimize \nand support regional cooperation and integration initiatives. Others \nare functional institutions: specialized organizations with a narrower, \noften technical, agenda that focus on a specific area (or range of \nareas) of cooperation and/or promote cooperation within a limited \n4", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \nBox 1.1.

There are also facilitating IRIs: institutions that have \ndeveloped programs and initiatives to bolster regional integration by \nproviding advisory, administrative, technical, and financial support.\nThe geographical scope of Asia\u2019s IRIs is diverse. Subregional ones \ninclude IRIs that focus on limited geographical areas\u2014such as the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program, the Coral \nTriangle Initiative, and the Greater Tumen Initiative\u2014and others that \nbring together larger subregions, such as the South Asian Association \nfor Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), \nand the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Intraregional \nIRIs connect countries from two or more Asian subregions: examples \ninclude the East Asia Summit (EAS),2 ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN+3), \nand the Network of Asian River Basin Organization (NARBO). Two \nIRIs have a pan-Asian remit: the United Nations (UN) Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Finally, transregional IRIs\u2014such as the \nAsia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM),  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \n(APEC), and the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEc)\u2014connect \nAsia and the Pacific with the rest of the world.

Existing IRIs may need to be made more \neffective, and in some cases new institutions may be required. At the \nsame time, national agencies may need to increase the powers they \ndelegate to regional institutions. However, Asian countries may not \nbe ready to surrender parts of their national sovereignty to regional \nbodies. This raises several important questions. What is the benefit \nto Asian countries of participating in subregional, regional, and global \ninstitutions? Will Asia be willing to create more pan-regional institutions, \na regional bureaucracy, and strong secretariats in key IRIs? What type \nof governance structure would these institutions need to adopt? Which \n7", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nspecific reforms and innovations on issues such as membership criteria, \ndecision-making rules, and budget contributions should they consider?\nThe great diversity among Asian economies and societies creates \nanother set of challenges for the establishment of common regional \nstructures. But recurrent crises affecting the region, from those of the \npast decades to the recent global economic and financial turmoil, \nunderscore the importance of enhancing regional cooperation and \nintegration. Asian authorities are becoming increasingly aware of the \nbenefits of closer dialogue, cooperation, and coordination among \nregional members. Stronger IRIs may be needed to enable Asia\u2019s \nvoice to emerge more strongly in global institutions and forums such \nas the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20. However, is the \ncurrent political environment conducive for strengthening Asia\u2019s IRIs? \nIs there enough commitment from Asian political leaders to increase \nregional cooperation and integration? Are relevant private sector and \ncivil society organizations aware of the issues and involved in the \nactivities of Asia\u2019s IRIs?\nClaims  that  Asian  economic  integration  is  a  relatively  new \nphenomenon and cooperation is lightly institutionalized (ADB 2008b) \nare grounded in implicit or explicit comparisons with other regions \nand their histories of economic cooperation. The most familiar is the \ncontrast between Europe, with its panoply of longstanding formal \ninstitutions, and Asia, which has self-consciously rejected the European \nmodel in favor of a more consensual and informal path toward \ncollaboration. Other regions\u2014such as the Americas, Africa, and the \nMiddle East\u2014may provide an equally useful standard of comparison, \ngiven the proliferation of their regional economic institutions in recent \ndecades, offering both positive and negative lessons. This in turn raises \nanother set of important questions. How does the extent to which \ncooperation is institutionalized vary across issue areas in Asia? What \nare the implications for efforts to cooperate within the region? Where \nthere are contrasts with other parts of the world, what explains them? \nAre there lessons that Asia could learn from Europe and other regions? \nAnd what are the likely prospects for further institutionalization moving \ntoward the creation of a regional community?\nThis study attempts to answer these questions. It is structured \nas follows. The remainder of Chapter 1 analyzes Asia\u2019s complex \ninstitutional  architecture  and  discusses  different  approaches  to \nregional institution building. Chapter 2 reviews the progress of Asian \neconomic integration and cooperation. It describes the contours of \nintegration, contrasting the progress made in production and trade in \nfinal goods with that in the services, monetary, and finance sectors, \nlikewise comparing the progress made in East Asia with that in \n8", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \nSouth Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific. It also reviews the progress of \nintegration and cooperation in infrastructure and regional public goods. \nChapter 3 reviews the analytical literature on the determinants of\u2014and \ndeterrents to\u2014further institutionalization, introducing the analytical \nconcepts used in the social science literature to analyze regional \ninstitutions. Chapter 4 puts these concepts to work by describing the \ninstitutional landscape in Asia and the Pacific. It provides an overview \nof existing regional economic cooperation arrangements and the \nextent of their institutionalization along different dimensions. Chapter 5 \nplaces institution building in a comparative context, highlighting Asia\u2019s \neconomic and political heterogeneity, openness to the rest of the \nworld, distinctive history, and unique security setting. It develops the \ncontrast with the experience of other regions such as Europe, Latin \nAmerica, Africa, and the Middle East, offering some important lessons \nfor Asia. Finally, Chapter 6 elaborates proposals for strengthening \nthe regional architecture, with the goal of cementing past gains and \npropelling the region forward to deeper integration. It includes a set of \npolicy recommendations for reforming Asia\u2019s institutional architecture \ntoward the creation of an Asian economic community.\n1.2. Asia\u2019s Institutional Architecture \nAs Table 1.1 shows, Asia has no shortage of IRIs. The regional policy \nforums  of  ASEAN,  ASEAN+3,  and  the  EAS  are  just  three  obvious \nexamples. Beyond East Asia, one can point to subregional forums \nsuch as SAARC, PIF, and CAREC. There are also major forums that \nconnect Asian countries with non-Asian ones, such as APEC and ASEM. \nFigure 1.1, which is taken from the Emerging Asian Regionalism study \n(ADB 2008b), depicts major subregional, intraregional, and transregional \noragnizations.  It  makes  clear  that  Asia\u2019s  institutional  landscape  is \nmultilayered and overlapping, and reflects the reality that regional \nintegration in Asia arose haphazardly rather than being planned.\nTable 1.1 and Figure 1.1 show the complexity of Asia\u2019s institutional \narchitecture for regionalism: the stereotype that Asian integration \nis  \u201cpoorly  institutionalized\u201d  is  misleading.  However,  most  Asian \ninstitutions operate with few explicit procedural rules, delegate few \ntasks to standing secretariats, and specify few obligations for their \nmembers.3 Asia\u2019s IRIs are typically based on a consensus approach \nto  decision-making,  supplemented  by  nonbinding  voluntary \n3  Some of Asia\u2019s IRIs have gone further than others in committing to standing procedures \nand rules-based arrangements, as Chapter 4 details.\n9", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nFigure 1.1.

Expressed in the terminology of international relations, \nregional cooperation in Asia entails only limited legalization, defined \nas a situation where rules are binding and precise, and where their \ninterpretation, monitoring, and implementation are delegated to a \nthird party.4 \n4  Again, though, some IRIs are more legalized than others.\n10", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \nThus, Asia\u2019s regional architecture is both complex and light \nat the same time: it has a dense and elaborate web of sometimes \noverlapping  institutional  arrangements  which  tend  to  center  on \nnegotiations among national governments rather than delegating \nauthority to regional bodies or engaging civil society. Asia\u2019s IRIs \ninvolve cooperation in specific fields among national governments \nthat retain their sovereignty, rather than the creation and operation \nof bodies or authorities transcending those sovereign states. Asia\u2019s \nIRIs emphasize flexibility, informality, and consensus: they can be \nthought of as confidence-building exercises which aim to create \nan  environment  conducive  to  building  trust  and,  on  that  basis, \nprogressive integration. \nAsia has adopted this approach for good reasons. In such a vast \nand  diverse  region,  defining  common  structures  and  governance \nrules  requires  flexibility  and  pragmatism.  Several  Asian  countries \nare postcolonial societies that attach special value to their national \nsovereignty,  limiting  the  appeal  of  pursuing  a  regional  agenda \nthat  requires  compromising  national  priorities.  Given  the  region\u2019s \ncomplicated history and cultural and social mix, Asian countries are \nusually unwilling to criticize their neighbors\u2014or to tolerate criticism \nfrom them\u2014limiting the capacity for adopting sanctions or even setting \nup feedback mechanisms based on objective performance indicators. \nFor all these reasons, efforts to regularize relations and build \nregional  institutions  have  concentrated  on  ongoing  interaction \namong  governments  within  project-specific  and  network-oriented \narrangements, framed in a manner that does not threaten sovereign \nprerogatives. This approach\u2014sometimes referred to as the \u201cASEAN \nway\u201d  after  the  institution  that  pioneered  it\u2014has  been  important \nfor cultivating the confidence and trust needed to build support for \ndeeper cooperation and integration. It has successfully reconciled the \nvalue that countries and their residents attach to national sovereignty \nwith  the  need  for  common  rules  and  regulatory  standards\u2014and \ngovernance thereof\u2014to support Asia\u2019s integrating markets.\nThe Challenge\nWhat has worked well in the past may work less well in the future, \nhowever.  The  first  step  in  integrating  markets\u2014namely,  reducing \nrestrictive border regulations\u2014can be achieved unilaterally or through \nnegotiations, bilateral or regional, between governments. Compliance \nwith such commitments is relatively straightforward to monitor. Asia \nhas thus made significant progress in reducing and eliminating tariff \n11", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nand nontariff barriers to trade by unilateral action, negotiating bilateral \nfree trade agreements, and establishing an ASEAN Free Trade Area \n(AFTA)\u2014but without establishing rules-based structures oriented on \nexternal enforcement, like those provided at the global level by the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO).  \nAfter this first step, however, progress becomes harder. The last \nremaining tariff barriers are the most sensitive (by definition, otherwise \nthey would already have been removed). Liberalizing trade in parts and \ncomponents was easy: importing countries were enthusiastic because \nthis facilitated the production for export of final goods. Liberalizing \nfinal-goods trade is harder, since it pits domestic and foreign producers \nwithin the region against one another. Unilateral liberalization, which \nhas carried much of Asian liberalization to this point, becomes trickier \nas more politically sensitive areas come into play. And once countries \nhave created a web of bilateral and subregional free trade agreements, \nrationalizing the resulting \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d of agreements poses more \nformidable collective action problems. \nMore generally, market integration and competition are impeded \nnot just by border restrictions but also by behind-the-border tax and \nregulatory policies favoring some (typically domestic) producers over \nothers. These include limits on entry by foreign suppliers of services, \ndiscriminatory public procurement practices, trade-limiting product \nstandards,  and  limits  on  foreign  direct  investment.  International \ndifferences in contract and sales law, including those whose purpose \nis not to bias outcomes in favor of buyers and sellers from one country \nover another, heighten uncertainty and create enforcement costs that \nalso limit cross-border trade and competition.\nAt this point, however, information on policies becomes more \ncostly to obtain and assimilate. Monitoring governments\u2019 compliance \nwith the provisions of their agreements is more difficult. Since there is \na wide range of possible regulatory policies, no single alternative may \nbe preferred by the median policy-maker, requiring an agenda setter \nto organize and direct the process. For all these reasons, progress may \nrequire the delegation of negotiation, monitoring, and enforcement \nfunctions to an entity other than governments. \nAs regional integration deepens, competition across borders also \nbecomes more intense. This widens the scope for disputes among \naffected parties in different countries. Increases in the frequency and \nintensity of disputes create a need for strengthened dispute settlement \nmechanisms.  In  a  more  deeply  integrated  regional  market  there \nis also more need for harmonized product standards and market \nregulations. This, in turn, requires closer coordination and monitoring \n12", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \nof  national  practices.  In  addition,  spillovers  intensify  as  markets \ngrow more integrated, heightening the importance of coordinating \nmacroeconomic  and  financial  policies.  This,  in  turn,  requires \nstrengthened monitoring of national policies. \nAs countries open up financially, global and regional spillovers \ntend to intensify, making it more important for governments and \ncentral banks to coordinate their policies. With increasing openness \nand integration comes greater exposure to external shocks, emanating \nfrom both within the region and outside. The economic disruption \ncaused by the 2008/09 crisis is a reminder of Asia\u2019s vulnerability to \nsuch shocks.\nThis exposure makes it more important, as Asia\u2019s economies \ncontinue to open and integrate, for them to have access to emergency \ncredit lines. This too is something that is appropriately organized at the \nregional level, and also requires strengthened surveillance of national \npolicies, possibly together with policy conditionality, so that external \nparties  are  willing  to  extend  credits.  More  elaborate  institutional \narrangements, not limited to consensus decision-making and involving \nbinding commitments and a greater degree of delegation, may be \nneeded to carry out all of these tasks adequately. \nThe existing institutional architecture may not be adequate for \nextending the process of deep integration beyond East Asia to South \nand Central Asia and the Pacific. These subregions are not as integrated \ninternally as East Asia. Nor are economic and financial links between \nEast Asia and these other subregions sufficiently well developed. \nInstitutions that evolved to support economic and financial integration \namong a limited number of Asian countries, often neighbors within a \nsingle subregion, may not be ideally suited for integrating the larger \nnumber of economies that now aspire to be part of \u201cFactory Asia.\u201d \nThe result is an Asian economy that is extensively but unevenly \nintegrated. Some product markets, notably those in manufacturing \nparts and components, are more deeply integrated than others\u2014those \nin labor-intensive services, for example. Some factor markets, such \nas those for skilled workers, are more deeply integrated than others, \nnotably those for unskilled labor. Some subregions, notably East Asia, \nare more deeply integrated than others, such as South and Central \nAsia. Some regional policies, such those promoting bond market \ndevelopment, are more closely coordinated than others, such as \nmonetary and fiscal policies.\nFinally, as Asian economies become more deeply integrated with \neach other and with the rest of the world, it becomes increasingly \nimportant to ensure the compatibility of regional and global integration. \n13", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nPolicies and measures to cement Asian integration should also help \nfoster Asia\u2019s links with the global economy. Institutional arrangements \nat the regional level should complement analogous ones at the global \nlevel, not compete or conflict with them.\n1.3. Approaches to Regional \nInstitution Building\nApproaches to strengthening Asia\u2019s IRIs through reform and innovation \nshould reflect not only the preferences of national governments and \nother relevant public agencies, but also those of civil society, opinion \nformers, and the general public about appropriate modalities for \ninstitution building\u2014otherwise they are unlikely to attract the political \nsupport needed to make them a reality.\nThe survey of regional opinion leaders commissioned for this \nreport, described in more detail in Appendix 1, sheds light on those \npreferences. As Figure 1.2 shows, there is broad-based support for \nstrengthening, consolidating, and streamlining existing IRIs. As many \nas 80% of respondents express strong support for this approach. These \nresults suggest that existing IRIs should be at the center of the region\u2019s \nfurther institution-building efforts. \nThere is also support for creating new institutions to deepen \nregional integration: 44% of respondents are in favor, and only 17% \nagainst. That said, the fact that 35% of respondents say they are neither \nfor nor against suggests that a lot depends on the precise form and \nfunction of any new IRIs. \nBuilding from the Bottom Up \nIf Asia follows a bottom\u2013up approach to building its regional institutions, \nis it better to proceed on a geographical or a functional basis? One \napproach would be to ask, for what geographic collection of countries \nare the efficiency advantages of further institutionalization likely to be \ngreatest and the sacrifices of sovereignty least? Is ASEAN, ASEAN+3, \nEAS, or some other grouping ripe for further institutionalization on the \ngrounds that cross-border spillovers are particularly pronounced and \nmember governments have similar policy preferences?5 \n5  Chapter 2 reviews some of the relevant evidence.\n14", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \nFigure 1.2.

The question was: \nIndicate to what extent you agree (or disagree) with the appropriateness of the different modalities for enhancing institutions for regionalism in Asia \nand the Pacific.\nSource: ADB (2010).\nAn alternative approach would be to ask, for what issue areas or \nfunctions are the efficiency advantages of deeper institutionalization \ngreatest and the sacrifices of sovereignty least? Does trade, finance, \nenvironment, infrastructure, or some other area involve particularly \nstrong  cross-border  spillovers  and  compatible  preferences  among \ngovernments? Should countries start by negotiating and completing more \nsubregional free trade agreements along the lines of AFTA, and more \nbilateral ones such as those between ASEAN and other Asian countries? \nShould the priority be further subregional financial cooperation, such \nas the harmonization of financial regulations across the region or the \nmultilateralization of the ASEAN+3 Chiang Mai Initiative and its newly \nestablished regional surveillance office? Should it be further efforts to \nstrengthen cooperation in areas such as infrastructure, which previous \nstudies\u2014notably Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia (ADB/ADBI 2009)\u2014\nhave suggested are ripe for development? Or should it be cooperation \nin enhancing security and fighting terrorism, which has long been the \nfocus of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation?6\n6  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has now also introduced a far-reaching economic \ncooperation agenda.\n15", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nSuch questions are difficult to answer. There is no single way of \nquantifying the extent of cross-border interdependence and spillovers. \nThere is no definitive measure of the similarity (or dissimilarity) of policy \npreferences across countries or of the willingness of governments to \ncompromise their sovereignty over specific issues on instrumental or \nstrategic grounds. \nBringing together these geographical and functional perspectives \nleads to the question of whether different groupings are appropriate for \ndifferent functional areas. One approach, known as \u201cvariable geometry\u201d \n(or multitrack or multispeed), is for different countries to choose whether \nor not to participate in integration efforts in different issue areas. For \nexample, one subgroup of countries may wish to push forward with \neconomic integration, another subgroup with security cooperation, and \nonly a few countries with both. Signs of de facto variable geometry in \nAsia include the fact that \u201ccooperators\u201d such as Singapore have been \nactive in forging free trade agreements with bilateral partners while also \nparticipating in ASEAN and its free trade area.\nAnother approach, sometimes known as \u201cconcentric circles,\u201d \nis for a hard core or inner circle of countries to proceed to a more \nextensive and heavily institutionalized form of regional integration, \nwith implications for a wide variety of issue areas, in which other \nmembers do not participate, at least initially. The idea is to build a set of \nregional institutions to which the pioneers opt in, while other countries, \nmore reluctant to cede sovereignty, opt out. The question then is, \nwhat rules and which countries decide who opts in and out? Are the \nincumbents entitled to prevent outsiders from opting in subsequently \nso as to prevent them from slowing the pace of institutionalization? \nOr are outsiders entitled to opt in if they satisfy a clearly specified set \nof preconditions so as to prevent the inner circle from becoming an \nexclusive club? \nASEAN as a Driver for Regional Integration\nIn the Asian context, ASEAN is sometimes seen as the \u201cvanguard \ninstitution\u201d that is leading the way to more extensive and strongly \ninstitutionalized regional integration.7 ASEAN was the first grouping in \nthe region to commit (in 1992) to the creation of a free trade area, \nto adopt a charter with legal obligations for members (2008), and to \nformulate a blueprint for creating the ASEAN Economic Community \n7  ADB (2006) and Lee (2008) both argue along these lines. See also Chapter 4.\n16", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n(AEC) by 2015. The AEC will entail a single market with a fully \nintegrated production base and the free movement of not only goods \nand services but also investment and skilled labor, as well as the freer \nflow of capital.8 ASEAN members have agreed to augment the AEC \nwith an ASEAN Political-Security Community and an ASEAN Socio-\nCultural Community. The ASEAN Charter also allows subgroups of \nASEAN countries to push ahead with more ambitious agreements \u201cif \nthere is a consensus to do so\u201d (Haggard 2009).\nUnlike  most  Asian  IRIs,  ASEAN  has  delegated  a  modicum \nof authority to a standing secretariat. Its progress toward a more \nlegalized model of organization, however, remains largely a matter \nof stated intent. When the AEC blueprint was launched, governments \ndelegated  to  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  increased  responsibilities  for \ninitiating,  advising  on,  coordinating,  and  implementing  ASEAN \nactivities. Members then adopted four sets of procedural rules issued \nthrough detailed, binding protocols requiring domestic ratification. \nThese rules created a regional dispute settlement mechanism, a \nprotocol requiring members to give prenotification of their intent to \nmodify existing concessions, a protocol governing the modification of \nprevious liberalization commitments, and a protocol that provides rules \ngoverning the exclusion of sensitive sectors from AFTA commitments \n(Khong and Nesdurai 2007).\nWhen moving from the creation of AFTA in 1992 to an agreement in \n2003 to establish the AEC by 2015, ASEAN created a legal unit within its \nsecretariat to give legal advice to member states and firms concerning \nlegal disputes arising from the AEC, as well as an ASEAN compliance \nbody to mediate disputes arising in this context. The charter signed \nat ASEAN\u2019s November 2007 summit in Singapore established a rules-\nbased entity and called for the creation of enforceable rules for \ntrade, finance, and environment, together with the establishment \nof a regional human rights body, and provided for the imposition of \nsanctions against members that fail to comply with the provisions of \nthe charter. Time will tell whether the grouping will follow through on \nthese commitments.9\nMore broadly, ASEAN is influential because of how it has succeeded \nin developing a sense of shared values and accepted procedures. It \nhas promoted informal and nonbinding institutional models governed \n8  www.aseansec.org/18757.htm\n9  Early signs are mixed: for example, no country has yet made use of the ASEAN dispute \nsettlement mechanism.\n17", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nby consensus decision-making. This \u201cASEAN way\u201d has been widely \nemulated by other regional and subregional institutions.\nFinally, several larger regional institutions have grown out of \nASEAN or developed by associating themselves with it. (In some cases, \nthis is evident from their very names.) Wider cooperation among \nEast Asian countries in response to the financial crisis of 1997/98 was \norganized by bringing together the members of ASEAN with the three \nlargest East Asian economies: the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of \nKorea. The first meeting occurred at the initiative of ASEAN, which \ninvited the \u201cPlus Three\u201d countries to the December 1997 meeting of \nASEAN leaders. ASEAN+3 summits continue to be held in conjunction \nwith the annual ASEAN summit. Meetings of the EAS (or ASEAN+6) \ntake place immediately after the annual ASEAN leaders\u2019 meeting. The \nASEAN Regional Forum is chaired by the chair of the ASEAN Standing \nCommittee.\nArguably, then, ASEAN plays a special role in the institutionalization \nof Asian integration. It serves as a catalyst for different interests by \nbringing together large and small powers in the region.10 And through \nits regular meetings and standing secretariat, it provides a platform \nfor ongoing integration efforts. Whether it can continue to do so as \nthe process of Asian integration broadens (and its center of gravity \nshifts away from East Asia) is an open question. ASEAN\u2019s informal \nand consensus-based approach has the virtue of enabling members \nwith diverse interests to remain nominally united. But this is also its \ngreatest limitation, for it inhibits operational decisiveness and renders \nthe strengthening of regional cooperation more difficult by giving de \nfacto veto rights to those favoring the status quo.\nBuilding from the Top Down \nThe alternative to the bottom\u2013up approach is proceeding from the \ntop down, by building a pan-regional institution. Such an institution \nwould lend coherence to the jumble of specialized functional and \nsubregional agreements, fostering consistency across more specialized \nand localized institutions regarding their obligations and principles. \nIt could set down general principles to govern all Asian IRIs. It could \ndraw attention to externalities: to the fact that actions by members \nof an IRI also impact on nonmembers. It would provide a venue in \nwhich all Asian countries had a voice. It would be a natural forum for \n10  As this is sometimes put, the PRC does not want Japan to lead and Japan does not want \nthe PRC to lead; hence ASEAN must lead by default.\n18", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \naddressing issues such as climate change, people trafficking, natural \ndisasters, and epidemics with pan-regional scope and consequences. \nA  further  rationale  for  the  top\u2013down  approach  is  that  the \ncompartmentalization of economic, security, political, and other issues \nhampers efforts to cooperate in each of these issue areas. Cooperation \nmay be easier to sustain when negotiations over several distinct issues \nare linked. With the entire set of issues on the table in a single forum, the \nscope for mutually beneficial agreements (cross-issue tradeoffs) will be \nenlarged. For example, countries that might resist agreements on political \nor security matters that are a priority for their neighbors might be willing \nto sign on in return for an agreement on economic matters which they \ndeem important. The costs of failing to cooperate in any area would also \nbe magnified insofar as this sours prospects for cooperating in other areas. \nBoth political scientists and economists have suggested that the \nparticular structure of economic and security interactions means that \nlinking negotiations in the two areas is likely to increase the chances \nof a cooperative outcome. (See Chapter 3 for details.) Intuitively, the \ndevelopment of more extensive economic cooperation and integration \n(the rise of \u201cFactory Asia\u201d) has heightened the incentive to cooperate \non security matters (since a security conflict within the region would \nlead to economic disruptions with greater costs).\nAlthough  foreign  policy  and  national  security  concerns  have \ninfluenced the pattern of Asian institution building, as described in \nmore detail in Chapter 5, economic and security relations in Asia have \nbeen pursued on distinct institutional tracks, which seldom reinforce \nor interfere with one another. Even institutions that pursue both sets \nof issues, such as ASEAN, do so without explicitly linking economics \nand security. This suggests that the potential for synergies has not been \nfully exploited and an encompassing regional institution would be well \npositioned to do so. \nImplications \nAsia has reaped enormous benefits from the deepening of regional \nintegration. The achievements of recent decades have resulted to a \nconsiderable extent from \u201cspontaneous cooperation\u201d growing out of \nindividual country actions (notably the PRC\u2019s unilateral opening) and \nglobal commitments (such as additional Asian countries\u2019 accession to \nthe WTO).11 Spontaneous though that cooperation may have been, it \n11  The phrase \u201cspontaneous cooperation\u201d is taken from Richard Baldwin\u2019s background paper \nfor this project (Baldwin 2009).\n19", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nhas spurred much deeper and more intricate patterns of integration in \nthe region, as documented in the Emerging Asian Regionalism study \n(ADB 2008b). \nAn important task now is to cement existing achievements. The \n2008/09 crisis is a reminder of their fragility. Past gains may be placed \nat risk, as they were in 1997/98, as national governments grapple \nwith newly pressing problems. Building stronger and more effective \nregional institutions is an important way of protecting what has been \nachieved. \nMoreover, insofar as the constructive response to the crisis is \nfor Asian countries to push ahead with deeper integration, stronger \nregional  institutions  will  be  needed.  It  was  possible  to  reduce \nand  remove  barriers  at  the  border  (tariffs  and  quotas)  through \nunilateral action, one-off bilateral agreements, and global (WTO) \ncommitments\u2014that is, through spontaneous cooperation. Removing \nbehind-the-border  barriers  and  moving  to  deeper  integration\u2014\nbuilding a truly integrated Asian market not just in goods but also in \nlabor and investment capital, broadening the process to include all of \nAsia, and ensuring the compatibility of regional integration with global \nintegration\u2014will require stronger institutional arrangements.\nImportantly, what is in Asia\u2019s interests will also benefit the rest \nof the world. Failure to solidify previous gains would have global \nconsequences: disputes and ill-advised policy measures that disrupt \ntrade and production in the region would threaten the vigor of the \nfastest-growing part of the world which is contributing most to the \ngrowth of global demand. The rebalancing of demand, achieved \nin  part  through  the  development  of  stronger  regional  institutions \nto ensure policy coordination, is essential for the reduction of the \ninterregional trade and current account imbalances that can be held \npartly responsible for the current crisis. Stronger regional institutions \nwill also contribute to effective global governance. They constitute a \nmechanism through which Asia can formulate and advance its views \nin global forums. More regional coherence achieved through the \noperation of stronger institutions means better representation of Asia \nin global institutions and hence more effective global governance.\n20", "Introduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \nChapter 2\nProgress of Regionalism\n21", "Chapter 2\nProgress of Regionalism\nA\n sia\u2019s importance in the world economy is increasing faster \n than ever.

Their \ndiversity, development pattern, and global integration have generated \na unique Asian model of regionalism\u2014dynamic, open, multitrack, \nand multispeed\u2014which enhances prosperity not only in the region \nbut also in the rest of the world. Asia\u2019s open regionalism underscores \nthe importance of strengthening trade, investment, and capital flows \nwithin the region while maintaining strong ties with and remaining \nopen to the rest of the world. Economic indicators confirm that \nregional integration within Asia has proceeded in parallel with its \nglobal integration (Kharas, Aldaz-Carrol, and Rahardja 2008).\nSeveral studies cite East Asia as a model of how economic growth \nand regional integration can create a virtuous circle, whereby rapid \nGDP growth fuels regional economic interdependence and closer \nregional integration facilitates faster growth and eventually poverty \n26", "Progress of Regionalism\nreduction (Schiff and Winters 2003; Tarr and Grugel 2003; Rodrik 2007). \nAs East Asia moves beyond the \u201cflying geese\u201d pattern of industrial \ndevelopment, regional economic integration is becoming an important \nengine of growth: the establishment of regional production networks \nand the expansion of trade ties are helping to foster a competitive \nbusiness  environment  that  promotes  technological  development, \nproduct and process innovation, and a rapid upgrading of labor skills \nacross the region (Gill and Kharas 2007).13\nThe \u201cfragmentation\u201d of production\u2014the scattering of parts of the \nproduction process across different countries\u2014is a major contributor \nto regional (and global) economic integration because it stimulates \nforeign direct investment (FDI) and the intensification of trade in \nintermediate goods. The rapid expansion of manufacturing exports and \nan increase in the trade/GDP ratios of dynamic East Asian economies \nhave, in turn, boosted GDP growth in recent decades (Athukorala \n2005). Intraregional trade in parts and components has also risen as the \npattern of regional production has become more specialized. The PRC \nhas become the main assembly plant for \u201cFactory Asia,\u201d and thereby a \nsignificant export destination for other East Asian economies as well as \na base for exporting to the rest of the world (ADB 2007, 2008b).\nRegional integration continues to be a key driver of economic \ngrowth for the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) and more \nadvanced Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies, \nwhich rely on the PRC and, increasingly, other lower-income East Asian \ncountries for assembly operations. It is also now boosting growth in \npoorer ASEAN economies such as Viet Nam and Cambodia, whose \nexport sectors rely on the import of intermediate goods from their \nneighbors for their viability. Moreover, as the recent global economic \nand financial crisis pushes East Asia towards a more balanced pattern \nof economic growth\u2014where domestic demand becomes a more \nimportant driver alongside exports\u2014Asian economies will become \nincreasingly important markets for each other\u2019s final products (ADB \n2009b). Regional integration will thus become an even more important \nelement of growth and poverty reduction in Asia.\nWhile Asia\u2019s economic dynamism has lifted hundreds of millions \nof people out of poverty, the region is still home to around two-thirds \nof the world\u2019s poor. Asia is a region of contrasts: vast in size as well as \n13  The region\u2019s opinion leaders surveyed for this study perceive \u201cfaster and more dynamic \neconomic growth\u201d as the main advantage of strengthening intraregional economic \nrelations.

Has regional policy cooperation been effective in \nfacilitating economic integration? To answer these questions, this \nchapter updates the analysis conducted in the EAR study, expands its \nscope to cover the entire Asia and Pacific region, and discusses new \nissues that have emerged since the 2008/09 global crisis. \nThe chapter is structured as follows. Sections 2.1\u20132.5 chart the extent \nof regional integration in trade and investment, money and finance, and \nlabor markets; gauge macroeconomic interdependence; and examine \nregional infrastructure ties. The progress of regional cooperation\u2014 \nincluding the proliferation of free trade agreements, recent initiatives for \nmacroeconomic and financial cooperation, and programs for delivering \nregional public goods\u2014is discussed in Sections 2.6\u20132.8. Key findings \nand challenges are discussed in Section 2.9.\n2.1. Production Networks and Trade \nIntegration\nMainly driven by market forces, economic interdependence in Asia and \nthe Pacific has increased rapidly in recent decades. Yet progress towards \na fully integrated regional market has been uneven across sectors and \nsubregions. Economic integration is concentrated in East Asia, where \nintricate regional production networks and supply chains have been \n28", "Progress of Regionalism\nTable 2.3.

With many \nparts and components required in the assembly process, trade in \nintermediate goods has helped link East Asian economies together. \nInvestment in infrastructure has also improved competitiveness and \nconnectivity, helping to attract FDI from multinational corporations. \nIntegration  in  final  goods  remains  moderate,  however,  because \nassembled goods are mostly exported to North America and Europe. \nMany  studies  have  documented  the  positive  effect  of  trade \nliberalization on economic growth (for instance, Sachs and Warner \n1995, and more recently Wacziarg and Welch 2008). Trade has become \nincreasingly important to Asia\u2019s economic growth in recent decades. \nAsia\u2019s trade/GDP ratio more than doubled from 31% in 1980 to 62% in \n2008 (Table 2.3).

Overall, trade is now as important to Asia (especially \nEast Asia) as it is to the European Union (EU), and accounts for a much \nbigger share of GDP in Asia than it does in North America.\nOne measure of a region\u2019s trade interdependence is the share of \ntrade within the region in its total trade, or intraregional trade share. \nOver the past 50 years Asia\u2019s intraregional trade share has shot up, \novertaking North America\u2019s and closing the gap with the EU, as panel A \nin Figure 2.2 shows. Panel B highlights how some Asian subregions \n(notably Northeast and Southeast Asia) are far more integrated than \nothers. Trade within East Asia has increased to more than half of its \ntotal trade in recent years.\nAnother  indicator  of  a  region\u2019s  trade  interdependence  is  its \nintraregional trade intensity, which measures its bias for trading with \nregional partners. Whereas a region\u2019s intraregional trade share tends to \nincrease with its weight in world trade, its intraregional trade intensity \ndoes so only when trade within the region rises faster than trade with \nthe rest of the world.

Whereas nearly 58% of Asia\u2019s trade in parts and \ncomponents was within the region in 2008, less than 45% of its trade in \nfinal goods was, as Table 2.4 shows. Looking at subregions, whereas \n56.3% of East Asia\u2019s trade in parts and components was within the \nsubregion, a mere 1.2% of Central Asia\u2019s and 1.3% of South Asia\u2019s was. \nAnd while nearly half (43.4%) of East Asia\u2019s trade in final goods was \nwithin the region, only 2.9% of Central Asia\u2019s and 2.8% of South Asia\u2019s \nwas.

Labor Mobility\nThe history of labor migration in Asia and the Pacific has been marked \nby colonization and decolonization processes, changes in political \nregimes, and disparities in economic growth. In the first half of the \n20th century, labor migration within the region was substantial; but \nin the second half of the century the onset of industrialization and \nrapid GDP growth in some Asian economies was accompanied by \nthe introduction of strict limits on foreign workers in many countries. \nToday the extent of labor mobility varies considerably across Asia\u2019s \nsubregions: it remains low in all subregions except\u2014technically\u2014\nCentral Asia, where the dissolution of the Soviet Union created new \nnational borders that turned internal migrants into international ones.\nAround a third (56.5 million) of the world\u2019s 175 million migrants \nin 2000 came from Asia and the Pacific. Over a third of those (almost \n21 million people) had moved within the region, as Table 2.8 shows, \nTable 2.8.

Only 8 million non-Asian migrants live \nin the region. Overall, many more people have moved away from Asia \nto the rest of the world than have migrated in the opposite direction. \nLooking at migration as a share of population gives a better \nidea of its significance (Table 2.9). Emigrants from Central Asian \ncountries were equivalent to 16.5% of their population in 2000, while \nimmigrants were 8%. In contrast, outbound migrants were equivalent \nto only 1.7% of Southeast Asia\u2019s population, 1.5% of South Asia\u2019s, and \n0.6% of Northeast Asia\u2019s. Emigration was much higher, at almost 9%, \nin the Pacific.16 Migrants within Central Asia account for 2.3% of the \npopulation, a share similar to that in the EU. Undoubtedly, official \nfigures underestimate labor mobility in Asia as they fail to capture \nunreported or illegal migration. Seasonal labor, which is significant, \nis also poorly captured by official statistics on international migration.\nOver  the  past  decade  Asian  workers  have  increasingly  been \non the move. They have gone abroad in search of better economic \nconditions and opportunities, often within the region itself, attracted \nby fast economic growth (ADB 2008a). Recent studies suggest that at \nleast until the 2008/09 crisis labor migration from Indonesia to Malaysia \nand the Philippines was growing fast, as was the number of workers \nfrom Myanmar in Thailand, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines; from \nthe Republic of Korea in Japan and the PRC; and from the PRC in Hong \nKong, China. Labor mobility within South Asia has also increased. \nEmpirical studies suggest that most Central Asian migrants work in \nthe Russian Federation, and to a lesser extent in Kazakhstan (ADB \n2008a; Hugo 2008; Hugo and Young 2009). However, the onset of the \ncrisis in 2008 led to a sharp tightening of labor migration restrictions in \nmany Asian countries and the departure (forced or willing) of many \nlabor migrants who lost their jobs or were fired to make way for native \nworkers (Legrain 2010).\nUnfortunately,  specific  figures  on  intraregional  labor  mobility \nare not available, but data on remittances from foreign workers are \na reasonable proxy. As Figure 2.6 shows, remittances to Asia and the \nPacific have soared, while outward remittances have also risen sharply. \nWhile some of this increase is due to improvements in data collection, \n15  Importantly, the figures in Tables 2.8 and 2.9 refer not to labor migration but to total migration, \nwhich includes non-worker as well as worker migrants.\n16  Emigration from many small Pacific islands is very high, but the regional average is lowered \nby Papua New Guinea, which is home to most of the population in the Pacific Islands but \nhas little emigration.\n40", "Progress of Regionalism\nTable 2.9.

Remittance flows are also affected by a \nvariety of other factors, such as exchange rate moves and the pressure to \nsend more money home in times of crisis. Anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat the increase in remittances from South Asian workers initially \ncame mainly from jobs on infrastructure projects in the Middle East. \nMore recently, the NIEs, Malaysia, and Thailand have attracted growing \nnumbers of Asian workers, especially from Southeast Asia\u2014at least until \n42", "Progress of Regionalism\nthe 2008/09 crisis (ADB 2008a; Sumulong and Zhai 2008; Hugo and Young \n2009). Japan is still reluctant to allow in foreign workers. As a share of \nGDP, remittances to South Asian countries were highest, while outflows \nfrom Southeast Asian countries were greatest (panel B of Figure 2.6).  \nTo recap, official figures suggest that labor mobility within Asia\u2019s \nsubregions is low, except within Central Asia where it is moderately \nhigh. While anecdotal evidence suggests that labor mobility within \nSouth Asia is growing as job opportunities increase, good comparative \ndata are sorely lacking.\nOther studies have used different proxies, such as tourism flows, \nto estimate intraregional labor mobility. These generally confirm that \npeople-to-people exchanges have increased over the past decade, \nespecially in Southeast Asia, and that tourism within Asia (as a share of \nAsians\u2019 total tourist trips) is gradually approaching the levels in the EU \nand North America (Capannelli, Lee, and Petri 2009). Overall, trends \nsuggest that labor mobility in Asia and the Pacific will continue to \nincrease. This creates a further rationale for closer regional cooperation, \nespecially considering the large potential gains from increased labor \nmobility (Rodrik 2002; Athukorala 2006; Legrain 2007; ADB 2008b).\n2.3. Financial Integration\nWhile  the  development  of  regional  production  networks  is \nstrengthening  trade  and  investment  integration  across  East  Asia, \nfinancial  integration  remains  low  throughout  the  wider  Asian \nregion.  Decades  of  bank-dominated  financial  intermediation  and \ngovernment-directed lending have left domestic financial systems \nunderdeveloped. Unsurprisingly, Asian capital markets are still much \nmore strongly integrated with financial centers in the US and Europe \nthan with each other.  \nThe  1997/98  financial  crisis  exposed  Asia\u2019s  overreliance  on \npoorly regulated banking sectors and a lack of well-developed capital \nmarkets. East Asian authorities responded with collective initiatives to \nstrengthen financial integration, with the aim of promoting efficient \nfinancial  transactions  across  the  region,  diversifying  sources  of \nfunding, and providing public goods such as financial stability and \ncrisis prevention measures. While these initiatives are starting to show \nresults, the region\u2019s massive savings are still largely intermediated \nthrough financial centers outside the region and invested in low-\nyielding foreign assets, reducing the efficiency of capital allocation. \nAsia\u2019s lack of financial integration is also a constraint on financing the \n43", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nFigure 2.7.

Two broad \nmeasures of financial integration exist: price indicators and quantity-\nbased ones (Lee 2008). When assets can be traded freely across a \nregion, prices for similar assets should become more similar (after \nadjusting for risks). In other words, greater financial integration should \nbe accompanied by a closer co-movement of prices. This, in turn, leads \nto a higher share of financial assets being traded within the region and \nheld by regional investors. \nPrice convergence can be measured from yields on financial \nassets.  Over  the  past  decade  the  variation  of  cross-market  yield \nspreads between long-term government bonds and US Treasuries \nhas sharply declined, suggesting that financial integration in Asia has \ndeepened (Figure 2.7). Yield spreads spiked again as the global credit \ncrisis started in 2007, but have since declined somewhat. \n17  See Section 2.5 for a discussion on financing regional infrastructure projects and Section 2.8 \nfor a detailed analysis of regional financial cooperation.\n44", "Progress of Regionalism\nFigure 2.8.

Asian equity \nmarkets have relatively high levels of foreign participation and remain \nvulnerable to sudden shifts in capital flows as well as developments in \nUS markets. Correlations between Asian and US stock markets have \nincreased over time, while those between individual Asian markets \nhave increased even more (ADB 2009a).\nAnother price indicator of financial integration is the extent of \nco-movement of equity indexes, with +1 indicating a perfect positive \ncorrelation, 0 no correlation, and \u20131 a perfect negative correlation.

Indeed, 90% of correlations among Asian \nmarkets increased between the two periods, and all were positive \nin the postcrisis period, suggesting an increase in regional financial \nintegration.\nQuantity indicators also suggest that regional financial integration \nis increasing.18 Figure 2.9 details how cross-border portfolio holdings \nof assets and liabilities evolved between 2001 and 2008. Excluding \nJapan, the 12 Asian economies for which data are available held \n25% of their foreign assets within the region in 2008, up from 15% in \n2001. If Japan is included, the picture changes markedly. As Japan \nholds very few Asian assets (2% of its total foreign assets in 2008) and \ninvests heavily in the US (32% in 2008), when Japan is included, Asian \ncountries hold a mere 10% of cross-border assets within the region (up \nfrom 6% in 2001), while the share held in the US is almost three times \nas much (27% in 2008, down from 34% in 2001). Interestingly, both \nAsian holdings of US assets and US holdings of Asian ones declined \n18  The data, which are from a portfolio investment survey started by the International Monetary \nFund in 2001, also shed some light on South and Central Asian countries where it is hard to \nfind data on the prices of financial assets.\n48", "Progress of Regionalism\nin absolute terms between 2001 and 2008, and also as a share of GDP. \nUnfortunately, these figures for financial assets do not cover the PRC \nor Taipei,China, which do not participate in the assets side of the \nsurvey. However, the figures on liabilities confirm the trend of low but \nincreasing financial integration suggested by the assets survey. Asian \neconomies\u2019 intraregional financial liabilities (including the PRC, Japan, \nand Taipei,China) increased from 10% of the total in 2001 to 16% in \n2008, with the US share declining from 37% to 33% of Asia\u2019s total.\nDetailed statistics from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nsurvey (not shown in Figure 2.9) suggest that while portfolio investment \nwithin Asian subregions has mostly increased since 2001, the share that \nSoutheast Asian countries invest within the subregion has fallen. The \nsurvey also highlights the lack of financial integration within Central \nand South Asia, as well as between them and the rest of Asia. Both are \nmore closely integrated with the US and other non-Asian countries. \nTo conclude, both price and quantity indicators show that financial \nintegration in Asia has generally risen in recent years but remains low. \nAsian financial markets are more integrated with global ones than with \neach other, especially when Japan is included. In part this is due to the \nunderdevelopment of various national markets and a lack of institutions. \nSeveral studies suggest that the low level of cross-border investments \nis also due to wide disparities in income levels and policy variables \n(Eichengreen and Park 2003; Eichengreen and Luengnaruemitchai \n2004). To improve the integration of the region\u2019s financial markets, \nfinancial cooperation among Asian countries needs strengthening.\n2.4. Macroeconomic Convergence\nAs documented in the EAR and other studies, the 1997/98 Asian crisis \nled  to  increased  macroeconomic  interdependence  among  Asian \neconomies\u2014and the 2008/09 global crisis may do so too. Output \ncorrelation  analysis  shows  that  the  co-movement  of  GDP  across \nAsia has increased considerably and business cycles of the region\u2019s \neconomies have become more synchronized. Income gaps between \nAsian economies have also narrowed sharply: the gap between the \nrichest and poorest countries, although still very high, has decreased \nmuch faster than in other regions of the world.\nIncreasing trade and (to a lesser extent) financial integration  \namong Asian economies should make their reaction to macroeconomic \nshocks more similar. Also, because Asian economies remain largely \ndependent on exports of final goods to the US and Europe, a demand \nshock from either will tend to affect Asian economies in a similar way. \n49", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nBusiness cycles across the region may thus become increasingly \nsynchronized (ADB 2008b).\nFigure 2.10 shows the results of an output correlation exercise \nconducted for India and 10 East Asian economies for which quarterly \nGDP figures are available, as well as for the EU and the US.19 The \nresults, which are tailored to update a similar analysis conducted \nin the EAR study (ADB 2008b), indicate that the output correlation \namong Asian economies has increased considerably over the past \ndecade. It was negative until the early 1990s, and has averaged \n0.5\u20130.75 since 1997. Although the sharp increase in the correlation \nsince 1997 largely coincides with the 1997/98 crisis and its impact \non the real economy, the average correlation both before and after \nthe crisis rose considerably. In other words, Asian economies have \nbecome much more interdependent\u2014indeed, their macroeconomic \ninterdependence, measured by GDP correlation coefficients, is now \ncomparable to that of the EU.20\nFigure 2.10 (panel B) charts the extent of East Asia\u2019s and India\u2019s \ninterdependence with the EU and the US. The results confirm the \nfindings of the EAR study. In particular, East Asian countries tend to be \nhighly interdependent with the US and Europe, their major economic \npartners, as well as with each other. In other words, there is no sign \nof a macroeconomic \u201cdecoupling\u201d of Asia from the US and EU. The \ninterdependence between East Asia and India has also risen and is \nnow similar to that between East Asia and the EU and US, although \ncaution is needed in reading too much into such statistical results.21\nAnother  measure  of  macroeconomic  interdependence  is  the \ndegree of convergence of regional incomes. Whereas in 1990 the richest \ncountry in Asia and the Pacific had a GDP per capita 363 times greater \nthan that of the poorest, the gap narrowed to a (still huge) 94 times \n19  Due to data limitations, the correlation analysis covered only 10 East Asian economies plus \nIndia and the first 15 EU members. Correlations are calculated using the natural logarithm \nof quarterly GDP data in local currencies and applying the Baxter-King method to derive the \ndata cyclical component by filtering the data for short-term fluctuations and the long-term \ntrend. A 12-quarter moving average is applied for the calculation, while the weights for \nindividual economies are computed using nominal GDP values. Data are available from the \nfirst quarter of 1987 until the first quarter of 2009, but as the filter drops the last 12 quarters, \nresults are shown until the end of 2007.\n20  Other recent studies have also shown that in the past decade the degree of macroeconomic \ninterdependence between East Asian economies and the US, as well as with the EU, \nhas increased, suggesting that East Asian economies have increased their intraregional \ninterdependence as well as their interdependence with the rest of the world (Capannelli, \nLee, and Petri 2009).\n21  Caution is needed in interpreting these results as standard measures of correlation tend to \nrise when volatility rises (Rigobon 1999). Using the Baxter-King filter helps reduce the effect \nof volatility. \n50", "Progress of Regionalism\nFigure 2.10. Strengthening Macroeconomic Interdependence\nPanel A.

The gap between the three richest and \nthe three poorest more than halved from 190 times to 88 times over \nthe same period. The gap is decreasing particularly fast in integrating \nsubregions such as Northeast and Southeast Asia, while it has increased \nin South and Central Asia (albeit from a much lower level). \nWhile inequality in East Asia is narrowing as poorer economies grow \nrapidly, inequality within countries has increased as some people profit \nmuch more from rapid economic growth than others, as discussed in \nthe EAR study (ADB 2008b). Such inequalities can be addressed, at least \npartially, through regional cooperation, as the EU\u2019s experience shows.\n52", "Progress of Regionalism\n2.5. Infrastructure and Connectivity\nDeveloping regional infrastructure is important in order to foster \neconomic  integration,  facilitate  connectivity,  and  link  Asia\u2019s \nsubregions. Regional connectivity has always been a major factor \nin  economic,  social,  cultural,  and  political  development;  as  the \nworld economy becomes more globalized, it is also an increasingly \nimportant source of comparative advantage (Krugman 1991). Yet \nimprovements in infrastructure have not kept pace with growing \ndemand, creating a huge financing gap, especially in developing \ncountries. \nMeeting Asia\u2019s massive national and regional infrastructure needs \nrequires huge investment\u2014as much as $8 trillion between 2010 and \n2020, according to the Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia study (ADB/\nADBI 2009). However, the backlog of pending projects is large and \ngrowing throughout the region. The 2008/09 crisis, which reduced the \navailability of private investment, has exacerbated these concerns. \nThe  Global  Competitiveness  Report  prepared  annually  for  \nthe World Economic Forum includes infrastructure development as \none of the four basic requirements for countries to be competitive \ninternationally.22 This suggests that Asia is lagging behind other more \nadvanced regions, as business leaders surveyed for the report rated \nthe quality of Asia\u2019s infrastructure as well below the G7 average. \nWhile such findings are inevitably highly subjective, they suggest \nthat in 2008 air transport in Asia was closest to G7 levels, while electricity \nsupply lagged furthest behind. Among Asia\u2019s subregions, Northeast \nAsia has the best infrastructure, while South Asia\u2019s is rated lowest. Ports \nand railways are highly developed in Northeast Asia, while road links \nin South and Central Asia are particularly poor. Table 2.12 summarizes \nthe results at the subregional level, while country details are shown in \nTable A2.2 in the Appendix to this chapter.\nA  closer  assessment  of  Asia\u2019s  regional  infrastructure  can  be \nattempted using World Bank data. Quantity measures (Figure 2.11, \npanels A1 and A2) indicate that South Asia is the subregion with the \nhighest road and rail density, although this still lags well behind the EU. \nAdjusting for population size, Central Asia has the most extensive rail \nnetwork. \n22  The others are institutions, macroeconomic stability, and health and primary education.\n53", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nTable 2.12.

The results, shown in panels B1 and B2 of \nFigure 2.11, indicate that Northeast Asia ranks highest among Asia\u2019s \nsubregions and not far behind the EU, while the Pacific is lowest. The \ngap between Asia\u2019s subregions and the EU is narrower in areas such \nas timeliness, but remains more pronounced in terms of the overall \nquality of transport and trade-related infrastructure.\nAs these figures confirm, boosting intraregional connectivity is \nnot simply a matter of building physical infrastructure; it also requires  \nhigh-quality  connections,  modern  transport  and  logistics  systems, \nefficient  customs  systems,  and  proper  institutions  to  facilitate \nconnectivity across Asian economies.

The need to reduce transport and logistics costs, by \nconnecting  production  clusters  in  different  countries  and  linking \nthese clusters with markets, will be a major challenge in the next few \ndecades. \nThe development of regional infrastructure has a direct impact on \nproductivity and trade: creating and strengthening economic corridors \ngenerates considerable benefits for the regional economy, not least \nby reducing trade costs and attracting FDI. The Infrastructure for a \nSeamless Asia study discussed the role of regional infrastructure and \nits potential impact on the creation of regional production networks \n(ADB/ADBI 2009). \nTwo programs for regional transport networks that have been \npromoted since the 1950s by the United Nations (UN) Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)\u2014the Asian \nHighway  and  the  Trans-Asian  Railway\u2014provide  a  framework  for \nplanning and prioritizing connectivity in the region. The Asian Highway \nis a transport initiative, covering 142,000 kilometers of roads passing \nthrough 32 countries, that aims to develop and improve road transport \ninfrastructure  to  promote  trade  and  tourism  and,  in  turn,  Asia\u2019s \neconomic and social development. The Trans-Asian Railway network, \ncomprising about 114,000 kilometers of railways in 28 countries, spans \nAsia, providing connections to Europe and offering links to major ports \nwhich provide sea access to landlocked countries, either directly or in \ncombination with highways. Although significant progress has been \nmade, major investment is required to complete and upgrade the \ntwo networks and enhance their hardware, as well as to implement \nrelated software components such as trade facilitation through cross-\nborder customs agreements.\nRegional cooperation is also essential in the energy sector\u2014to \nconnect markets, address energy security concerns, and promote \nenergy efficiency. While each country has distinct energy needs and \nresources, integrated regional planning would permit cost-effective \nand  environmentally  sustainable  regional  projects  and  lead  to  a \nwider energy market. While there are obstacles to regional energy \nintegration\u2014such  as  the  technical  incompatibility  of  transmission \nlines\u2014recent  projects  include  the  export  of  natural  gas  from \nIndonesia to Singapore, and hydropower projects in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) that sell energy to Thailand.

However, \nthe availability of private finance for infrastructure projects fluctuates \nwidely. Private participation is important not only for project financing, \nbut also to enhance the efficiency of infrastructure service provision. \nTo promote such participation, which experts estimate could cover \naround 20% of total infrastructure investment, sector-level reforms \nare needed to create an enabling legal and regulatory environment \n(ADB/ADBI 2009). In addition, deeper and wider financial markets, \nboth domestic and regional, are required to help fund bankable \ninfrastructure projects. But since reforms and market developments \ntake time, in the short run, regional infrastructure will likely have to \nbe funded largely by the public sector, complemented by domestic \nsavings where possible.\n2.6. Free Trade Agreements\nCountries in Asia and the Pacific have traditionally liberalized their trade \nunilaterally or through multilateral negotiations at the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and its predecessor, the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT). In general, they have lowered their barriers \nto trade and investment faster than countries in other regions. But over \nthe past decade or so, with progress at the WTO stalled and the US \nand EU rushing to conclude preferential agreements around the world, \nAsian governments have negotiated a panoply of trade and investment \nagreements with countries inside and outside the region. \nThe recent history of efforts to increase trade and investment \ncooperation in the region can be broadly divided into five phases.24 \nThe first phase, from 1960 to 1967, was mainly Japanese-led (Kojima \n1971), and at its core was a proposal for a Pacific Free Trade Area \n(PAFTA). PAFTA was to have five members: Australia, Canada, Japan, \nNew Zealand, and the US. It was motivated by Japan\u2019s growing \nrecognition  of  the  Pacific  region\u2019s  importance  for  its  economic \ngrowth, and was also a response to the creation of the European \n23  The study shows that in present value terms nearly $200 billion, or 19%, of total energy costs \ncould be saved over the next two decades if the energy sector were integrated across the \nGreater Mekong Subregion and optimal use were made of its well-diversified resource base.\n24  For a historical overview of economic cooperation in the region, see Petri (1993).\n57", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nEconomic Community. But the relatively small number of countries \nin the proposed grouping and, more importantly, their general lack of \nenthusiasm for PAFTA proved insurmountable obstacles. In particular, \nopinion in the US did not favor such a potentially discriminatory free \ntrade agreement (FTA) (Drysdale 1988).  \nThe  second  phase,  between  1967  and  1977,  saw  a  variety \nof  proposals  and  initiatives.  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand formed ASEAN in 1967. During this initial \nphase,  ASEAN  was  mostly  a  consensus-based  politico-security \ncommunity and paid little attention to economic issues. Although \nASEAN adopted a preferential trading arrangement (PTA) at its Bali \nsummit in 1976, this had little impact on regional trade because of its \nnarrow commodity coverage and half-hearted implementation (Ariff \n1994; Athukorala and Menon 1997). \nThe Pacific Basin Economic Committee (PBEC) was also formed \nin  1967.  The  PBEC,  which  was  much  less  institutionalized,  was \nbasically a private business-oriented organization that grew out of \nAustralian\u2013Japanese commercial cooperation. It was mainly a vehicle \nfor creating personal and information networks in the region. While the \ntheme of the first Pacific Trade and Development Conference was the \nfuture of PAFTA, support for it was soon abandoned in favor of a less \ninstitutionalized and more issue-specific problem-solving approach \n(Higgott, Cooper, and Bonnor 1991). This was formalized in a proposal \nfor the creation of the Organization for Pacific Trade and Development \n(OPTAD), modeled on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD), to provide a forum for regional discussion, airing \ngrievances, and promoting understanding of economic transformation \nin the region (Drysdale and Patrick 1979). OPTAD was also expected \nto provide a forum to assist in the management of the increasingly \ncomplex US\u2013Japan relationship (Drysdale 1988). Even though it was \nmuch less ambitious than PAFTA, OPTAD was never established.\nThe third phase, from 1978 to 1988, saw the formation of the \nPacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) in 1980. PECC drew \non many of the ideas of OPTAD and proposed a tripartite institutional \nforum  (with  government,  business,  and  academic  components) \nfor regional economic cooperation. It was also a loose institutional \nsetting that functioned through informal consultative meetings and \npurpose-specific taskforces. Its major achievements were developing a \n\u201cPacific perspective\u201d on trade and development issues and facilitating \nthe exchange of information and networking on issues of regional \neconomic significance. PECC, which has a secretariat in Singapore, \nbrought in ASEAN countries as members, as well as the PRC and \n58", "Progress of Regionalism\nTaipei,China. The only regional FTA established during this period \nwas the closer economic relations (CER) pact between Australia and \nNew Zealand, which came into force on 1 January 1983. Unlike most \nFTAs, the CER automatically included all goods traded between the \ntwo countries unless specifically excluded, thus making it one of the \nmost comprehensive trading agreements in the world.  \nThe fourth phase, from 1989 to 1999, saw the establishment in \n1989 of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the culmination of \ndecades of effort to bring about regional economic cooperation in the \nAsia-Pacific region.25  In 1992 ASEAN leaders agreed, through the ASEAN \nFree Trade Area (AFTA), to establish an ASEAN free trade area by 2007. \nThis deadline was subsequently brought forward to 2005. The main \nmechanism for realizing AFTA was the common effective preferential \ntariff (CEPT) scheme. The CEPT, which is basically sectoral, provided \nmore comprehensive product coverage than previous attempts at \nliberalization that employed an item-by-item approach. \nThe fifth, ongoing phase, which began around 1999, has witnessed \na dramatic proliferation of FTAs in the region. Every country in Asia \nand the Pacific, except Mongolia and Timor-Leste, is now a member \nof at least one FTA. Figure 2.12 illustrates how the number of FTAs \ninvolving at least one country from the Asia-Pacific region has soared \nsince 1990\u2014and even more so after 2000\u2014to reach 221 by the end of \nJanuary 2010. Of those 221, 112 have already been concluded, another \n60 are under negotiation, and 49 more have been proposed. \nThe proliferation of FTAs over the past decade has largely taken \nthe  form  of  bilateral  trade  agreements  (BTAs),  which  numbered \n42 in 1999 and 195 in January 2010. More than half of these BTAs\u2014\nwhether concluded, being negotiated, or proposed\u2014involve a partner \noutside Asia and the Pacific. Such deals can scarcely be described as \npromoting regional cooperation. \nA breakdown of FTAs by country reveals that Singapore has \nconcluded  most  (34),  followed  by  India  (33),  and  Pakistan  (26), \nas Table 2.13 details. Most FTAs involving India or Pakistan have yet \nto be concluded, however.

In  particular,  the  ERPD  assesses \nglobal, regional, and national economic conditions; monitors regional \n28  More recently, South Asian countries have also started a dialogue on macroeconomic and \nfinancial cooperation, although the process is still in an embryonic form.\n29  ASEAN+3 includes the 10 members of ASEAN (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam), plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.\n30  Before the ERPD was introduced, the finance ministers of the 10 ASEAN members had \nalready created their own surveillance process in 1998 to strengthen their policy dialogue \nin the monetary, fiscal, and financial fields. The ASEAN Surveillance Process is coordinated \nby a unit established within the ASEAN Secretariat.\n66", "Progress of Regionalism\ncapital flows and currency markets; analyzes macroeconomic and \nfinancial risks; looks at how to strengthen banking and financial system \nconditions; and can give East Asia a unified voice in discussions on \nreforming the international financial system (ADB 2009a).\nCooperation  through  the  ERPD  is  still  mostly  limited  to \ninformation exchange. There is little or no discussion on the adoption \nof  common  regimes  or  binding  policy  coordination  agreements. \nSharing  information  among  regional  peers  through  dialogue  and \nmacroeconomic monitoring is a first and necessary step for policy \ncooperation:  it  helps  improve  each  country\u2019s  understanding  of \nmacroeconomic and structural issues, economic and financial trends \nand  challenges,  and  policy  options.  Deeper  cooperation  requires \nagreement on new regimes, such as adopting harmonized regional \nstandards. Eventually, as the costs and benefits of cooperation become \nclearer, authorities may find merit in pooling their sovereignty through \nfull policy coordination (Kawai and Takagi 2005).\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s Bond Markets\nASEAN+3 finance ministers have made some progress towards setting \nregional standards through the adoption of two major initiatives under \nthe ERPD: the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) and the Chiang \nMai Initiative (CMI). The ABMI aims to help develop East Asia\u2019s local-\ncurrency bond markets and deploy the region\u2019s huge savings for \nregional investments. The CMI seeks to shield East Asian economies \nfrom the recurrence of currency and liquidity crises such as the one \nthat hit the region in 1997/98. The development of East Asia\u2019s bond \nmarkets is also being fostered by the introduction of two Asian Bond \nFunds (ABFs) by the Executives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia Pacific Central \nBanks (EMEAP), as Box 2.5 explains.\nDeveloping local-currency bond markets is very important to \nincrease the resilience of national financial systems to economic \nshocks. The impact of the 1997/98 crisis would have been less severe \nif the region\u2019s companies had been able to tap well-developed local-\ncurrency bond markets rather than borrowing in foreign currencies or \nrelying on bank loans. Developing Asia\u2019s local-currency bond markets \nhas since become a policy priority. Along with domestic regulatory \nreforms, the ABMI and ABFs31 have boosted East Asia\u2019s local-currency \n31  The launch of the ABFs may have inspired multilateral agencies to introduce similar funds \nin other emerging markets. For example, the World Bank launched the Global Emerging \nMarkets Local Currency Bond Fund as part of its strategy to develop bond markets in \ndeveloping countries by opening them up to foreign investors, thereby providing an \nadditional source of local financing.\n67", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nBox 2.5.

But with the notable exception of the Republic of Korea, they \nremain tiny throughout Asia for a number of reasons, including poor \ndisclosure and accounting standards; a preference for investing in \nequity markets; weak market infrastructure and related legal systems; \nthe large role played by commercial banks in corporate financing; and \na widespread perception that yields are low, as most corporate bond \nissuers are either entities that are government-owned or government-\nsupported,  or  private  sector  blue-chip  companies  (ADB  2009a). \nThe absence of well-developed, diverse corporate bond markets \nconstrains investors, generating a demand for regional initiatives in \nthis area. \nWhile much still needs to be done, the region\u2019s local-currency bond \nmarkets have come a long way since the 1997/98 crisis. This success \ngives East Asian governments an incentive to address remaining market \nimpediments, including the need to reform tax structures, harmonize \nrules, overcome regulatory obstacles, strengthen infrastructure, and \ntighten legal frameworks. Most East Asian economies\u2014notably the \nfour Asian economies hardest hit by the 1997/98 crisis (Indonesia, the \nRepublic of Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand)\u2014have reduced their \ncurrency mismatches over the past decade. As a result, these were \nmuch less of a problem during the 2008/09 crisis (Goldstein and Xie \n2009). The region\u2019s local-currency bond markets generally showed \ngreat resilience during the 2008/09 crisis: they played a key role in \nfinancing fiscal deficits and funding domestic companies at a time \nwhen liquidity had evaporated from global markets.

The CMI was designed to \naddress  short-term  liquidity  problems  and  supplement  existing \ninternational financial arrangements in the event of an emergency. \nIt initially involved an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement (ASA)37 \ncovering all ASEAN members, together with a network of bilateral \nswap agreements (BSAs) and repurchase facilities among ASEAN+3 \ncountries. The CMI also provides an institutional mechanism to pursue \nfurther negotiations, rather than simply a final agreement on swap \narrangements.\nASEAN+3  finance  ministers\u2019  meetings  in  2008  and  2009 \ntransformed  the  BSAs.  Ministers  decided  to  expedite  the  CMI \nMultilateralization (CMIM), and agreed that this should take the form \nof a collectively managed reserve-pooling arrangement governed by \na single contract, thereby reducing costly and wasteful duplication. \nASEAN would contribute 20% of the reserve pool, with Japan and the \nPRC (including Hong Kong, China) each contributing 32% and the \nRepublic of Korea 16%. Finance ministers also agreed to expand \nthe pool of foreign currency reserves. The fund has grown from \n$36.5 billion in 2001 to $84 billion in 2008 and $120 billion in May 2009. \n37  Central banks and monetary authorities of the original five ASEAN members (Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) agreed to establish reciprocal currency \nor swap arrangements in August 1977. The ASA was created primarily to provide liquidity \nsupport for those experiencing balance-of-payments difficulties. The duration, coverage, \nand amount of the ASA have expanded markedly since its inception. Originally intended \nto be in place for only a year, the arrangement has been extended incrementally. The CMI \nexpanded the ASA to all 10 ASEAN members.\n73", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nThe CMIM was signed by member countries in December 2009 and \nbecame effective in March 2010.38\nThe maximum amount that each country can borrow from the \nCMIM fund is based on its contribution multiplied by a borrowing \nmultiplier which favors smaller economies. For example, the borrowing \nquota of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and \nViet Nam is five times their contributions, while Hong Kong, China; \nIndonesia; Malaysia; Singapore; and Thailand can borrow 2.5 times \ntheir contributions. The Republic of Korea\u2019s borrowing multiplier is \n1.0; for Japan and the PRC (not including Hong Kong, China), it is 0.5 \n(Table 2.14).

To assess borrowing countries\u2019 \ncapacity  to  meet  lenders\u2019  repayment  conditions,  the  institutional \ncapacity to exercise due diligence is also needed. If government \npolicies need adjusting, unconditional financing could create moral \nhazard  for  both  potential  borrowers  and  international  investors, \neven when it does not harm prospects for timely repayment. Only \nthrough surveillance can a lending program identify the appropriate \ncombination of financing and adjustment. The AMRO will allow the \nCMIM to rely more on its own assessments when making lending \ndecisions\u2014about both the amount and any conditionality\u2014reducing \nmoral  hazard  and  mitigating  concerns  that  problems  leading  to \nbalance-of-payments difficulties may require structural adjustments. \nHowever, the AMRO is not meant to replace the IMF, but to enhance \neconomic monitoring, supplementing the IMF, especially given its \nnew short-term liquidity facility, which enables certain countries to \nborrow without conditions. Under the CMIM, a country can draw up \nto 20% of its quota for up to six months without being subject to IMF \nconditionality, while any amount over this limit would need to be tied \nto an IMF program. \nInstitutionally, the CMIM agreement sets a workable precedent for \naddressing other priority areas for regional cooperation. For example, \nenhanced intergovernmental dialogue has spurred further cooperation \nin  trade,  investment,  and\u2014importantly\u2014financial  supervision  and  \nregulation.  The  new  institutional  model  could  also  be  used  for \nspeeding up financial market development, for instance setting up a \nfund to invest in developing regional bond markets, and thus better \nuse of the region\u2019s huge savings to help finance its massive investment \nrequirements. \nThe CMIM governance structure could also be a model for tackling \nregional public goods such as the environment, security, disaster \npreparedness,  and  disease  prevention.

The CMIM could also eventually add new crisis \nprevention functions.\nThe CMIM\u2019s success depends on boosting its current size. In \nthe event of a regional crisis in which a clutch of countries needs \nemergency financial support, $120 billion is unlikely to be sufficient. \nDuring the 1997/98 crisis, Asian countries required between $40 billion \nand $60 billion in liquidity support; yet, as shown in Table 2.14, the \nlargest  ASEAN  economies  (Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand) can individually access less than $12 billion \nfrom CMIM funds.41 ASEAN+3 countries could easily increase the fund \nsize by tapping their international reserves: the CMIM amounts to less \nthan 3% of the near $4.2 trillion in international reserves that ASEAN+3 \ncountries had accumulated by the end of 2009 (Figure 2.15). \nWhile capital flows to ASEAN+3 countries are growing rapidly \nagain, after an initial decline when the global financial crisis struck in \n2008/09, they remain highly volatile (Somchai and Sussangkarn 2009; \nPlummer 2010). During the crisis, the Republic of Korea and Singapore \nopted to request bilateral lines from the US Federal Reserve instead \nof mobilizing CMI funds, perhaps because the funds available were \nnot enough to cover their liquidity needs during the credit squeeze of \nlate 2008 (Soesastro 2008). \nTo facilitate an increase in the CMIM fund, member countries may \nhave to move away from self-insurance in the form of foreign reserves, \nand start shifting funds towards this regional support facility. Whether \nthe  CMIM  eventually  develops  into a  regional  fund for  monetary \ncooperation that can fully cater for emergency liquidity needs will \ndepend on a number of factors, including how the CMIM\u2019s membership \nand size evolve, as well as how effectively the AMRO performs regional \nsurveillance.\nTo conclude, Asian economic authorities have various options to \nstrengthen macroeconomic and financial cooperation and promote \n41  Compared with the total amount of IMF quotas, which at the end of February 2010 \namounted to some $71 billion for ASEAN+3 countries, CMIM contributions do not seem \nsmall, although this amount was only 25% of total IMF contributions ($333 billion).\n77", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nFigure 2.15.

Regional Public Goods \nWhile economic cooperation in Asia and the Pacific has focused \non  trade,  investment,  finance,  and  monetary  initiatives,  regional \nauthorities  have  also  initiated  dialogue  and  programs  aimed  at \nfacilitating the collective provision of regional public goods (RPGs) \n78", "Progress of Regionalism\nin areas such as the environment, health, communicable diseases, \nsecurity, and education. Cooperation in delivering RPGs is gaining \nmomentum  because  issues  such  as  environmental  protection \nand controlling pandemics are assuming strategic importance for \ngovernments, which increasingly realize that such public goods can \nbe provided more efficiently at a regional level rather than wholly at a \nnational or global level.42\nThe potential benefits of regional cooperation for the provision of \npublic goods are huge. A survey of the region\u2019s opinion leaders in 2008 \nfor the EAR study found that while cooperation in this area was lagging, \nit was expected to bring the largest benefits. The survey results also \nsuggested that in order to provide and manage RPGs, Asian countries \nshould begin a regional dialogue and create specific institutions that \nhelp to sustain these types of initiatives (Capannelli 2010).43 The survey \nof the region\u2019s opinion leaders conducted for this study produced \nsimilar results (see Appendix 1).\nRegional public goods can be split into two groups: those that \ninvolve pan-regional externalities and are therefore best addressed at \na region-wide level; and those with a more limited geographical scope, \nwhich are nonetheless important and require proper coordination \namong interested parties to avoid unnecessary and costly duplication. \nIn the first case, countries can reap economies of scale and internalize \npositive spillovers as more of them cooperate; in the second, countries \ncan  gain  from  specialization  in  functional  areas  through  proper \ncoordination. To be sure, it is not always easy to identify the exact \ngeographical scope of RPGs and thus which group should provide \nthem (Tanzi 2005). In some cases, they may be best provided by a \nsubset of countries within a region; in others, global cooperation may \nbe more effective. Box 2.6 outlines selected initiatives that help provide \nRPGs in Asia.\n42  A clear rationale for cooperating to provide RPGs emerges when the effectiveness of \npolicy initiatives and programs increases as ties with neighboring countries or members of \nregional groupings are strengthened (Sandler 2005). Public goods have two fundamental \ncharacteristics: it is not possible to exclude anyone from using them (non-excludability), \nand consumption of the good by one individual does not diminish the amount available for \nothers (non-rivalry). In general they are unlikely to be supplied by market mechanisms, since \npotential suppliers are deterred by the knowledge that they will not be able to reap the full \nbenefit of their efforts. Intervention is therefore needed to ensure adequate provision.\n43  More than 40% of respondents to the 2008 perception survey (600 opinion leaders from \nSouth, Northeast, and Southeast Asia) found that regional cooperation among Asian \ncountries in the provision of RPGs was still very weak, especially in South and Northeast \nAsia. More than 80% of respondents thought that the advantages of strengthening \nintergovernmental initiatives to provide RPGs were very high, while 73% suggested that \nAsian countries needed to create regional institutions for providing RPGs.\n79", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nBox 2.6.

Regional cooperation is important to help overcome \nAsia\u2019s excessive reliance on fossil-based energy, diversify to \nother energy sources such as crude oil, gas, and hydropower, \nand mitigate the impact of the uneven distribution of such \nresources across countries. Regional cooperation to provide \nRPGs is also important for other reasons, notably ensuring \nenergy  security,  identifying  collective  solutions  to  energy \nconstraints, and promoting energy trade.

Increased regional \nintegration  provides  an  opening  for  the  expansion  of \ntransnational crime. Recent studies have found that human \nand drug trafficking increase when there are differential growth \nrates across regional economies, as well as when connectivity \nimproves. Progress in addressing these issues requires region-\nwide  policy  dialogue  and  cooperation  among  the  largest \npossible number of national authorities.\nAnother important area for regional cooperation is combating \nclimate change and promoting low-carbon green growth. Individual \ncountries and development agencies such as ESCAP and ADB have \nalready  launched  initiatives  in  this  area.  The  first  regional  policy \ndialogue on green growth was held in 2005 in the Republic of Korea, \nwhere  several  countries  launched  the  Seoul  Initiative  on  Green \nGrowth.

Filling the Gaps\nWhile Asia has made impressive progress in economic development \nand regional integration, a striking feature that emerges from the \nanalysis in this chapter is that regionalism has advanced unevenly: \nit is focused almost exclusively on production integration in East Asia, \nwhile other sectors and subregions are generally much less integrated. \nThe networks of production facilities established in many East \nAsian countries in industries such as electronics, automobiles, and \nmachinery\u2014\u201cFactory Asia\u201d\u2014have tied economies together through \ntrade and FDI. But regional integration in other functional areas such \nas  final  goods,  services,  labor,  and  financial  markets  has  lagged \nbehind.  Financial  integration  is  increasing,  but  is  still  quite  low. \nRegional integration in South and Central Asia and the Pacific has also \nproceeded much more slowly than in East Asia. \nTable 2.15 captures the uneven progress of regionalism in Asia and \nthe Pacific: while integration is more advanced in East Asia, ties within \n45  While Japan and the Republic of Korea have taken an early lead in supporting \nenvironment-friendly economic growth strategies, countries such as Cambodia, Fiji \nIslands, the Philippines, and Viet Nam have also now adopted national policies promoting \nlow-carbon green growth. Such policies typically seek to mitigate greenhouse gas \nemissions and cope with the impacts of climate change. \n46  Any disruption in applying this principle may lead to suboptimal cooperation results, mainly \nbecause of a mismatch between benefits and contributions (Kanbur 2001).\n83", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nTable 2.15.

The efficiency advantages of regional \nsupply chains and production networks have fostered trade integration, \nleading to integration in other areas. FDI accompanies trade, insofar as \ntrade and investment are complements. In this model, financial flows \nfollow trade flows\u2014as portfolio investment is used to hedge trade-\nrelated risks\u2014and as vertical intra-industry trade rises, so do business \ncycle co-movements and macroeconomic interdependence (Frankel \nand Rose 1998; di Giovanni and Levchenko 2009). \nThe analysis in this chapter provides evidence of this trend in Asia, \nand suggests focusing on trade links as the measure of interdependence \n84", "Progress of Regionalism\nfrom which other links will follow.

As  a  result,  financial \nintegration, although still relatively low, has increased\u2014especially in \nEast Asia\u2014over the past decade. In South Asia, however, trade and \nfinancial ties remain weak, and only recently have policy initiatives \nstarted to improve matters. \nTrade links and regional connectivity (in transport and energy) are \nalso low between East and South Asia, presenting huge opportunities \nfor interregional integration. Central Asia is poorly integrated (apart \nfrom moderately high labor mobility), although recent initiatives and \nprograms have started to help it enhance connectivity with South \nand East Asia as well as with Europe and the Middle East. The Pacific \nIslands have insurmountable geographical barriers to closer economic \nintegration, which translate into low indicators of regional economic \nintegration.

In a demand-driven model of institution \nbuilding, institutions develop as a means of problem-\nsolving. The issues that they attempt to tackle may relate to cross-\nborder spillovers (externalities) associated with economic integration, \nstrategic competition, foreign policy aims, or domestic politics. In the \narea of economic policy, the focus of this report, regional institutions \nmay help to meet three types of demand that arise from regional \neconomic integration.\nFirst, they can help consolidate gains from integration, whether \nas the result of regional initiatives or steps at the national and global \nlevels. For example, regional agreements can prevent backsliding on \ntrade and investment liberalization, including unilateral actions by \nnational governments.\nSecond,  regional  institutions  can  also  help  deepen  regional \nintegration. In addition to the lifting of barriers to exchange at the border \n(such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers), governments may commit \nto remove barriers that lie behind the border in an array of politically \nsensitive (and often jealously guarded) domestic policies. Regional \ninstitutions can make such commitments credible by monitoring and \nenforcing them.\nThird, regional institutions can help widen economic integration. \nThey  may  help  develop  infrastructure  that  lowers  transport  and \ncommunication costs. They may also establish new policy regimes \n92", "Designing Effective Regional Institutions \nthat admit governments originally outside the core of integrating \neconomies. Whereas deepening tends to be a response to economic \nintegration, widening is often a response to a lack of it, aiming to \nstrengthen ties between previously disconnected regions.\nInstitutions for regional integration (IRIs) in Asia and the Pacific \nshould aim to satisfy these three demands, together or separately. \nAs well as responding to demands from within the region, they may \nseek  to  respond  to\u2014and  influence\u2014changes  in  the  international \nenvironment. Demands for new institutions can arise from external \nshocks\u2014a defensive regionalism that deploys institutions to buffer \neconomies against future shocks. The Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI), \ndescribed in Chapters 2 and 4, was an institutional response to the \n1997/98 financial crisis, which many Asian governments attributed \nto defects in the global financial system. Regional institutions can \nalso enable their members to influence global decision-making and \nnegotiations. In the early 1990s, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n(APEC) served as a regional \u201clobby\u201d in the final stages of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round negotiations. \nThe drive for stronger institutions in Asia today is in part motivated by \nthe desire for a more influential regional voice at the global level.\nDespite their potential for valuable problem-solving at the regional \nlevel,  creating  and  reforming  regional  institutions  are  inherently \ndifficult. The prospect of efficiency gains or enhanced economic \nwelfare alone is rarely enough to secure agreement on a particular \ninstitutional  design.  Institutions  may  fail  to  achieve  their  original \nmandates or the subsequent goals set by their members. In other \nwords, the supply of regional institutions may not always respond to \ndemand\u2014and those that are supplied may not effectively serve their \nprincipals, the national governments that create them.\nThe chapter is structured as follows. Section 3.1 examines the \nrole  of  a  region\u2019s  initial  characteristics,  which  often  indicate  the \nenabling conditions for\u2014and obstacles to\u2014institutional development. \nTheir effects can be partially overcome (or exploited) through careful \ninstitutional design. Section 3.2 considers three drivers of institution \nbuilding over time: the possible linkage between economic and security \nissues, feedback mechanisms from economic integration that can \nreinforce regional institutions, and the competition and complementarity \nof global, regional, and subregional institutions. Section 3.3 outlines \nelements of institutional design that can enhance cooperation given \ndiverse national preferences and capabilities. Section 3.4 examines \nhow to measure institutions\u2019 effectiveness. Section 3.5 concludes.\n93", "Institutions for Regional Integration\n3.1. Regional Characteristics\nThree initial characteristics of a region generally influence regional \ninstitution building: the diversity of national preferences over economic \ncooperation and regional institutions, asymmetries in economic and \nmilitary power, and the influence exerted by actors outside the region.\nPreferences over Regional Cooperation  \nand Institutions\nWhen national governments come to favor similar policies, cooperative \nbargains are more likely to be struck and consistently implemented \nwithin regional institutions (Kelley 2009). Closer regional economic \nintegration may strengthen demands from corporations and governments \nfor  institutional  responses  to  cross-border  spillovers  and  policy \nvolatility. These demands should, in turn, produce national preference \nconvergence that facilitates regional cooperation (see Chapter 1).\nOther characteristics may also influence the range of national \npolicy preferences in a region. Income disparities\u2014the gap in per \ncapita  gross  domestic  product  between  the  richest  and  poorest \ncountries\u2014may produce policy disagreements grounded in divergent \neconomic interests and gaps in capacities to implement international \ncommitments. States in a wholly democratic region may be more willing \nto join regional institutions; greater political and policy transparency \nalso tends to promote regional cooperation. Democracy\u2019s impact on \nthe implementation of international commitments is more ambiguous \n(Simmons 2001; Kelley 2009). If dominant political coalitions are \ninternationalist, regional collaboration is also more likely.47 Integrating \nAsia\u2019s increasing economic interdependence and its leadership by \nelites committed to establishing links to the world economy have both \nsupported regional institution building. However, even if governments \nagree that greater regional cooperation is needed, they may not agree \non how regional institutions should be designed.\nAsymmetries in Economic and Military Power\nHeightened demand for regional collaboration is not enough to create \nthe requisite institutions. Establishing and maintaining institutions are \ncostly; disagreements over how to distribute those costs may impede \n47  Solingen (2009) compares the Middle East and Asia on this dimension.\n94", "Designing Effective Regional Institutions \nregional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  distribution  of  economic \ninfluence and military power within a region may affect governments\u2019 \nwillingness to establish regional institutions. However, researchers \ndisagree on whether a region with a dominant power or one with a \nmore balanced distribution of power is more likely to construct robust \ninstitutions.48\nA  dominant  regional  power  may  be  willing  to  provide  a \ndisproportionate share of regional public goods as well as institutional \nresources to ease distributional conflicts. A leading economy can \nalso serve as a focal point around which others coordinate national \npolicies. In Europe, for example, Germany served as the anchor for the \nEuropean Monetary System before the euro\u2019s launch. Japan provided \nfinancial leadership in Asia following the 1997/98 crisis through the \nNew Miyazawa Initiative.49 This leadership was supported by monetary \npolicy credibility (Germany) and large international reserves (Japan).\nHowever, larger countries tend to be less willing to delegate \nauthority  to  regional  institutions,  and  regional  leadership  that  is \nperceived as illegitimate or overbearing can produce a backlash \nthat undermines cooperation.50 A further complicating factor is the \ndynamic of power relations: rapid and uneven economic growth may \nproduce shifts in economic and military power that make institutional \nbargains more difficult to construct. Ultimately, whether great-power \nrivalry or reconciliation dominates a region may be more significant \nthan the number of such powers. Political accommodation between \nFrance and Germany was crucial to the development of European \ninstitutions; a similar reconciliation between Brazil and Argentina laid \nthe foundations for the Mercado Com\u00fan del Sur (Mercosur).\nInfluence of External Actors\nOutside intervention and bargaining power can have both positive and \nnegative effects on regional collaboration and institutional outcomes. \nBy creating an external threat to regional security (the Soviet Union \nduring the Cold War) or economic shocks (the United States during \nthe post-Bretton Woods era), governments outside a region may \nencourage \u201cdefensive regionalism\u201d\u2014closer regional collaboration to \n48  Compare Mattli (1999), Acharya and Johnston (2007b), and Dominguez (2007).\n49  The formal title of the New Miyazawa Initiative was \u201cA New Initiative to Overcome the \nAsian Currency Crisis.\u201d \n50  Smith (2000) documents powerful states\u2019 influence on the design of dispute settlement \nmechanisms.

In regions with \nimportant ties to external powers, those outside parties will be deeply \ninterested in the choices made in building regional institutions and \npossess substantial leverage to influence those choices.\n3.2. Institutional Dynamics\nA region\u2019s underlying characteristics are not the sole determinants of \nthe shape and effectiveness of regional institutions. Four additional \nfactors  also  shape  the  dynamics  of  regional  institution  building. \nFirst, the interaction between security conditions and economic ties \ninfluences the development of regional institutions. Second, economic \nintegration itself can create positive (or negative) feedback effects \non  institutionalization.  Third,  global  and  subregional  institutional \nalternatives may compete with, or complement, regional institutions. \nFourth, contingencies may interrupt or accelerate these processes: \npolitical entrepreneurs may advance regional aims; external economic \nshocks and crises may disrupt or deepen regional collaboration.\nEconomics and Security\nNo region directly manages core economic and security issues in a \nsingle regional institution. Nevertheless, the interrelated dynamics \nof economic integration and security provision have influenced the \ndevelopment of regional institutions. Military conflict within a region \nmay  disrupt  regional  institutions  and  slow  the  growth  of  cross-\nborder economic exchange. An external military threat, such as that \nexperienced by Western Europe during the Cold War, often reinforces \ndrives for institutional means to confront those threats.\nIn other circumstances, the careful linkage of peacebuilding\u2014the \ngradual winding down of regional rivalries\u2014and economic integration \nhas strengthened both economic and security cooperation. Regional \ninstitutions can be built on an association between economic opening \nand a lowering of military tensions. They can in turn reinforce this \nlinkage through the risk of economic loss from political or military \nconflict.  As  regional  collaboration  reinforces  economic  ties,  the \ncosts imposed by militarized disputes and conflict increase. Box 3.1 \ndescribes how political economists model this interaction.\n96", "Designing Effective Regional Institutions \nBox 3.1.

The theoretical and \nempirical basis for these prescriptions is suspect. More compelling \nis an analysis of the spillovers and feedback loops produced by \neconomic integration and its accompanying institutions\u2014processes \nthat may (or may not) widen the scope of regional institutions and \ncommon policies.\nBased on the experience of Europe and other regions, Baldwin \n(1993,  2009)  identifies  several  feedback  mechanisms  of  varying \nstrength; their sequencing may produce more or less institutionalization \nas  trade  and  investment  expand.  Most  involve  interest-based \nconjectures: trade liberalization increases the political weight of export \ninterests, which demand further liberalization. These trade-dependent \n97", "Institutions for Regional Integration\neconomic interests may lobby for membership in an expanding FTA or \ncustoms union because of the threat of trade discrimination, a \u201cdomino \neffect\u201d that creates successive waves of applicants. Alternatively, they \ncould lobby for offsetting regional or bilateral arrangements with at \nleast some of the FTA members. Feedback mechanisms may also \nlink trade and exchange-rate cooperation. Governments (and trade-\ndependent economic interests) may become more attracted to stable \nexchange rates as economies become more open to international \ntrade and capital controls are removed (Frieden 1991; Eichengreen \n1996; Baldwin 2009).\nBaldwin  (2009)  also  highlights  the  importance  of  institutional \nfeedback\u2014the ability of regional institutions to amplify and channel \ndemands for integration into further institutional elaboration\u2014in cases \nwhere institutions have both a mandate from national governments to \nfurther economic integration and the delegated authority to carry out \nthat mandate. Effective institutions may also create demands for further \ninstitutional development; institutional failures produce resistance to it.\nThese feedback mechanisms will be weakened if regions find \nsubstitutes for institutional strengthening that satisfy the demands \nof  trade-dependent  constituencies  in  other  ways.  Also,  regional \ncooperation, whether in trade or monetary and financial areas, has \nsometimes proceeded on the basis of political and foreign policy \ncalculations rather than felt demand. Even in the absence of strong \neconomic  feedback  effects,  those  steps  may  deepen  economic \ncooperation  through  political  spillovers,  the  creation  of  habits  of \ncooperation, and heightened trust.\nGlobal, Regional, and Subregional Institutions\nSince the 1990s (if not the 1930s), the prospect that regional institutions \nmight  undermine  global  rules  and  institutions  has  preoccupied \nproponents of trade liberalization (for contrasting views see Barton \net al. 2006; Bhagwati 2008; Lawrence 1996). Less attention has been \npaid to the competition that successful global institutions pose to \nthe development of regional governance. To the extent that regional \ninstitutions exist to solve problems and global ones achieve some \nof those ends more effectively, the impetus for regional institution \nbuilding may be undercut. In certain areas, such as trade, explicit \nrules govern the relationship between global regimes and regional \ninstitutions (GATT Article XXIV, for example); such explicit rules are \nabsent in the sphere of monetary and financial cooperation.\n98", "Designing Effective Regional Institutions \nSubregional institutions may also compete with one another, as \nwell as with regional institutions. Such competition appears to be \nmost damaging when subregional organizations have overlapping \nmemberships and similar policy mandates. Where a clear division \nof  labor  exists  among  subregional  institutions,  or  between  them \nand  region-wide  organizations,  relations  are  more  likely  to  be \ncomplementary than competitive.\nContingencies\nContingencies\u2014which are inherently difficult to predict\u2014often have \na decisive influence on the development of regional institutions. They \nmay include unexpected domestic events, such as Indonesia\u2019s regime \nchange in 1965, which was an essential precursor to the formation \nof  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN).  Political \nentrepreneurs\u2014national  leaders  who  promote  bold  new  policy \ninitiatives\u2014are particularly important. They may do so because they are \nstaunch believers in regional cooperation, or because they calculate \nthat regional institution building may bolster their domestic political \nposition\u2014or indeed their legacy.51 Europe\u2019s institutional development \nhas benefited periodically from such individuals, notably the original \ncore of politicians who founded the European project and Jacques \nDelors, the integrationist president of the European Commission in the \n1980s. In Asia, Prime Minister Mohamad Mahathir of Malaysia promoted \nan East Asian Economic Group in the early 1990s, an idea that was \nonly realized with the creation of ASEAN+3 later in the decade. When \nthey were prime ministers of their respective countries, Japan\u2019s Yukio \nHatoyama and Australia\u2019s Kevin Rudd sought to play a similar role in \nthe debate on Asia\u2019s institutional architecture.\nPolitical  entrepreneurs  may  seize  on  another  contingency: \nexogenous shocks, particularly economic crises. Henning (2009a) finds \nthat regional institution building is closely connected to economic and \nfinancial crises. Drawing on cases such as the Latin American debt \ncrisis of the 1980s, the European currency crisis of the 1990s, and the \n1997/98 financial crisis in Asia, Henning finds that a crisis with severe \nregional effects creates doubts about global institutions and revives \ninterest in regional solutions to regional economic problems. Crises \nalso often force a reordering of national and international priorities, \ncreating a more conducive environment for political entrepreneurs. \n51  On the role of the political entrepreneur in the creation of international institutions, see \nKeohane (2001).\n99", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nGovernments may have a window of opportunity in which they can \novercome skepticism at home and achieve compromises with their \nregional partners, producing a regional public good that is viewed as a \npressing need in difficult times.

By agreeing on \nmember contributions, voting rights, and an operational structure, \nASEAN+3 has established a framework for addressing institutional \npriorities and other cooperation issues.\nBy exposing regulatory gaps and denting confidence in global \ninstitutions that manage credit, market, and liquidity risk, the crisis \nalso prompted the region to propose establishing an Asian financial \nstability dialogue (ADB 2009b). Many argue that a formal structure \nis needed to coordinate macroeconomic policies and surveillance. \nThe \u201cPlus Three\u201d\u2014the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea\u2014held \ntheir first meeting to discuss regional and global financial stability \nin  November  2008.  More  broadly,  the  global  discussion  on  how \nto enhance financial stability and governance has spurred Asia to \nreassess its role in the global economy and in reshaping the global \nfinancial architecture. The Financial Stability Forum was expanded \nin March 2009 to include the PRC, India, Indonesia, and the Republic \nof Korea along with other G20 members which were not previously \nrepresented on it (Financial Stability Forum 2009). Similarly, the Basel \nCommittee on Banking Supervision was expanded in June 2009 to \ninclude Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and other emerging \neconomies. But while the individual influence of Asian economies in \nglobal bodies has increased, their collective impact could be much \ngreater if they acted in concert.\nCrises can have very different impacts on regional cooperation. The \n1997/98 crisis led to a plethora of government-led regional cooperation \n102", "Designing Effective Regional Institutions \ninitiatives and the formalization of \u201cEast Asia\u201d as a region. While the \nrecent one has exposed outstanding weaknesses, it is also galvanizing \nAsia to play a role commensurate with its growing economic strength \nin reshaping the global financial architecture.\n3.3. Institutional Design\nInstitutional design can play a key role in overcoming the barriers to \nsustained cooperation discussed above, not least differing preferences \nor concerns over sovereignty (defined as policy-making autonomy). \nDecision  rules,  legalization  (including  the  delegation  of  authority \nto regional institutions), and rules governing enfranchisement and \nmembership can all help further regional cooperation.\nDecision Rules and Side Payments\nDecision rules influence many aspects of cooperative bargains. Few \ninternational institutions operate through the simple majority rules \nwidely found in domestic democratic regimes. Even in those that \nallow simple majorities for certain actions, such as the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), conventions have produced a strong tendency \ntoward consensus decision-making. Majority decision-making among \nparticipants with divergent preferences over key issues is likely to \nproduce substantial and often persistent minorities that are confronted \nwith outcomes they strongly dislike and cannot change. This is a recipe \nfor fracturing an organization composed of nation-states, since the exit \noption is usually readily available.\nMost regional and global institutions rely instead on consensus \ndecision rules: open opposition from a single state can defeat any \nproposed  action  or  commitment.52  Consensus  decision-making \nprevents the emergence of discontented minorities; it also serves \nas a strong commitment device, since changing any agreement is \ndifficult. This also makes it difficult for an institution to respond quickly \nto changing circumstances (or crises). Despite its popularity in Asia \nand elsewhere, consensus decision-making involves a steep tradeoff \nbetween  commitment  and  decisiveness.  Because  agreements \nreached by consensus are so difficult to change, they are hard to reach \n52  Consensus is not the same as unanimity, which requires active support from all members. \n103", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nin the first place: bargaining often becomes protracted and may fail. If \nconsensus fails because of a less powerful state or group of states, more \nactivist and powerful states may be tempted to proceed separately. \nConsensus rules protect all minorities, constraining the powerful as \nwell as protecting them against actions by a majority of weaker states. \nThe result, however, is often a failure of collective action.\nA particular interpretation of consensus decision-making, when \ncombined with complete equality among members, imposes additional \nconstraints on institutional capacity. In ASEAN, for example, equal \ncontributions are made to the secretariat\u2019s budget and other funds \nthat support ASEAN\u2019s activities. If differential contributions became \nthe norm, ASEAN\u2019s richer members would probably insist on a system \nof weighted voting, in which decision rules reflected their greater \ncontributions to the institutional budget. Instead, ASEAN has relied \non  voluntary  contributions  from  members  for  specific  purposes, \nsidestepping the difficult issue of changing fundamental decision rules. \nAs Severino (2009) points out, despite ASEAN\u2019s deep attachment to \nconsensus decision-making and the sovereign equality of its members, \ndecision-making efficiency has led to ad hoc qualification of these rules.\nThe shortcomings of consensus decision rules have led to hybrid \nformulas in a few regional organizations where preferences converge on \nkey issues. Typically, these solutions combine some variant of weighted \nvoting, which grants greater voting power to more powerful (or richer) \nstates, with supermajorities, which protect minorities, albeit to a lesser \nextent than consensus decision rules. In the IMF, certain key decisions \nrequire at least 85% of voting shares. In effect, this grants a veto to the \nUS, whose quota is large enough to form a blocking minority; other \ngroups, such as the European Union (EU) or developing countries, can \nalso block decisions by acting together. In the EU, systems of qualified \nmajority voting in the European Council, which brings together the \nleaders of national governments, have combined larger vote shares for \nmore populous members with the requirement of supermajorities that \nhave varied in size over time (Hix 2009). Under such systems, states that \ncontribute more resources receive greater formal influence through the \nvoting rules and can also be reassured that smaller (and often poorer) \nstates will not be able to extract additional resources from them at will. \nSmaller states can be confident that they will not be swamped by great-\npower blocs. The recent multilateralization of the CMI represents the \nfirst major step in an Asian regional institution toward such a hybrid \nvoting formula. Its rules will permit decisive action in a financial crisis \nwhile protecting the interests of the largest states, which are providing \nmost of the funds for the CMI (Haggard 2009).\n104", "Designing Effective Regional Institutions \nA related mechanism that serves to placate discontented minorities \nand  encourage  their  continued  collaboration  is  compensation\u2014\nside payments to those who might be disadvantaged by a particular \ncollective agreement. Side payments may take any number of forms, \nfrom financial compensation to assistance on other issues of interest \nand even minor gestures that provide political prestige. Institutional \ndesign can make the provision of side payments more or less difficult. \nIn Asia, concessions to the most recent ASEAN entrants (Cambodia, \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam) during \nthe negotiation of the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) suggest \nthat compensation is most often needed to win the consent of poorer \nmembers to cooperative agreements that may benefit richer members \ndisproportionately (Haggard 2009). Box 3.3 considers the role of side \npayments in international cooperation.\nCommitment Devices\nDecision rules are critical to reaching regional agreements and may \nalso  help  prevent  collective  backsliding.  They  are  less  effective, \nhowever, against defection by individual governments. Particularly \nwhen  new  commitments  concern  the  deepening  of  economic \nintegration\u2014thereby venturing into politically sensitive new domains \nand  arousing  opposition  from  a  new  array  of  interest  groups\u2014it \nmay be tempting to renege on (or fail to implement) agreements. \nCommitment mechanisms embedded in regional institutions can help \nbind a government and its successors.\nThe mobilization of high-level political commitment has often been \nessential for the launch of new institutions; it provides a necessary sign \nof commitment to both regional and domestic audiences. The direct \ninvolvement of national political institutions, such as legislatures and \nbureaucracies, reinforces regional commitments by making them truly \nintergovernmental, rather than \u201cinter-executive\u201d (Dominguez 2009).\nAnother  valuable  institutional  instrument  for  strengthening \ncommitments to cooperate is legalization. This is defined by three \nmeasures: the precision of international commitments, the degree \nto which those commitments are legally binding, and the authority \ndelegated to third parties, particularly global or regional institutions, for \ninterpreting, monitoring, and enforcing those commitments (Goldstein \net al. 2001). One or more dimensions of legalization can substitute \nfor others: rather than elaborate regional institutions with delegated \nauthority, precise and binding commitments may create incentives for \ncompliance.\n105", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nBox 3.3.

The least demanding, because \nthey  involve  the  smallest  transfer  of  authority,  are  information \ngathering  and  research.  But  even  such  modest  tasks  may  help \nsustain national commitments to regional agreements through peer \npressure  on  recalcitrant  members.  More  significant  commitment \nmechanisms include the direct monitoring of member states and \ntheir implementation of agreements. A further delegation of authority \ninvolves  the  interpretation  of  agreements  and  adjudication  of \ndisputes through dispute settlement mechanisms situated in regional \ninstitutions. The most substantial of these are regional courts, which \nhave become significant in areas ranging from human rights to trade \nand investment (Voeten 2009).\nDelegation  is  not  accurately  measured  by  the  elaboration  of \nregional institutions: too often these ambitious blueprints do not actually \nexercise the powers awarded on paper. On any measure, however, \nnational governments have delegated relatively little authority to Asian \nregional institutions. The Asian Development Bank stands out as the \nmost prominent example of consequential delegation to a regional \ninstitution. ASEAN has a small secretariat of just 70 professional staff \nwhose operational autonomy has long been closely circumscribed by \nmember countries. APEC has no real permanent secretariat; most of \nits planning is implemented by officials from the country hosting the \nleaders\u2019 summit.\nThis pattern of limited delegation may be changing, however. \nASEAN\u2019s new charter formally empowers its secretariat to monitor \ncompliance by member countries. Through the CMI\u2019s \u201cIMF link,\u201d \nregional governments have effectively delegated conditionality to the \nIMF for large-scale lending. Devices that national governments may \ndeploy in order to limit a regional institution\u2019s policy independence \ninclude requiring a unanimous intergovernmental decision for any \ndelegation of authority, rules governing representation on the regional \nexecutive that ensure its preferences are close to those of member \ngovernments, and high thresholds for the adoption of any initiatives \nfrom the regional executive to ensure a high degree of consensus  \n(Hix 2009).\nAnother  commitment  device  is  the  enfranchisement  of \nnongovernment actors. Despite the intergovernmental character of \nregional institutions, nongovernmental actors may be permitted to \n107", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nparticipate in them. Rules for enfranchisement in regional courts, \nfor  example,  are  central  to  their  effectiveness  (Voeten  2009). \nGiven  the  reluctance  of  governments  to  deploy  regional  dispute \nsettlement  mechanisms  against  their  regional  partners,  activation \nby  private  actors\u2014\u201ccooperators\u201d  who  lie  outside  the  cartel  of \nnational  governments\u2014has  been  essential  to  the  empowerment \nof regional courts in the interests of regional economic integration. \nWhen national governments agree to slow integration or renege on \ntheir regional commitments, private actors who would benefit from \nfurther integration are able to use regional institutions to reactivate \nthe integration process, interpret the rules that have been agreed, and \nprevent backsliding by governments.\nMembership Rules and the Widening  \nof Regional Institutions\nMembership  rules  are  particularly  important  for  the  widening  of \neconomic integration. In integrating Asia, membership rules will play \na central role in the extension of policy cooperation beyond East and \nSoutheast Asia to South and Central Asia.\nAs Kelley (2009) describes, regional institutions tend to fall into \ntwo broad membership models. Club models impose strict admission \ncriteria, which can encompass economic and regulatory harmonization \nwith existing members, additional liberalization, and commitments \nto respect human rights or the rights of national minorities. In other \nwords, under the club model, admission requirements give existing \nmembers leverage over a prospective member\u2019s policies. The convoy \nmodel is more permissive. All states within a particular geographical \narea (ASEAN) or on a more or less ad hoc basis (APEC) are candidates \nfor membership, with few stipulations for policy change in advance \nof accession. As these examples suggest, Asian regional organizations \nhave typically chosen the convoy model.\nBoth models\u2014and the many variants that lie between them\u2014have \nstrengths as regional institutions seek to expand their geographical \nscope.  Convoy  organizations  primarily  use  socialization  to  shape \nthe behavior of new members; their effectiveness seems greatest \nin the security domain, where inclusiveness is particularly valuable. \nClub institutions have a wider array of instruments with which to \nshape  the  behavior  of  prospective  and  current  members  (Kelley \n2009). As cooperation deepens, however, the bar for new members \nbecomes higher. In some cases, when disagreement over the content \n108", "Designing Effective Regional Institutions \nof the  cooperative bargain grows too great, club institutions will \nmove toward segmentation (those who wish to move ahead with \ncooperation in new domains may form separate institutions for that \npurpose) or differentiated membership categories within the same \norganization. If members agree on common goals for integration, \nmultispeed integration may be adopted, allowing lengthy transitional \nperiods or \u201copt-outs\u201d for new members. If disagreement over the \naims of integration is more profound, variable geometry or \u00e0 la carte \nregionalism may be required. Under these rules, a single institution \nrecognizes different \u201cintegration spaces.\u201d For example, several older \nmembers of the EU have opted out indefinitely of membership of the \neuro (variable geometry), while newer members have yet to satisfy its \nmembership criteria (multispeed membership).\nAlthough these alternatives permit groups of \u201ccooperators\u201d within \na  large-membership  organization  to  proceed  with  their  preferred \nprojects, new or aspiring members are not always less keen on closer \nintegration.

Conclusion\nInstitutions for regional integration vary in response to the demands \nthat they satisfy and the supply conditions under which they are \nfounded and operate. Economic integration (or its absence) can \ncreate three types of demand from governments: the provision of a \ncollective barrier to policy backsliding (consolidation), commitment \nmechanisms to guarantee the removal of behind-the-border barriers \nto exchange (deepening), and a means for broadening economic \nintegration, incorporating previously disconnected members in the \ngrowing web of economic interdependence (widening). When the \nglobal environment produces negative economic shocks, demand \noften  grows  for  regional  institutions  to  buffer  those  shocks  and \ninfluence global institutions and negotiations.\nA region\u2019s initial characteristics can exert a persistent influence \nover the shape of its regional institutions. Heterogeneity on several \ndimensions\u2014income  disparities,  regime  type,  level  of  economic \nintegration\u2014produces  convergent  or  divergent  preferences  over \neconomic cooperation and institutions. The distribution of economic \nand military power within a region, when combined with great-power \nrivalries, can increase or reduce the supply of regional institutions. \nExternal actors may possess leverage that undermines or supports \nregional collaboration. None of these characteristics is necessarily \nfatal to regional institution building, but an institution\u2019s effectiveness \ndepends on designing it to offset their effects.\nThe dynamics of institution building vary. Economic ties and security \nrelations can reinforce or offset one another: a region of military allies, \nsuch as the North Atlantic, is more likely to integrate economically \nthan one of military rivals, such as South Asia. As economic integration \nproceeds, strong feedback effects may strengthen integration and the \ninstitutions that support it. The degree of competition among global, \nregional, and subregional institutions also varies. Global institutions \nprovide an alternative outlet for trade-dependent interests that desire \nfurther  liberalization.  Subregional  institutions  that  provide  more \neffective, small-membership venues for collaboration may hamper \nwider regional aggregations. Regional dynamics are also influenced \n110", "Designing Effective Regional Institutions \nby contingent events. Two are particularly important: the appearance \nof political entrepreneurs who link domestic politics and regional \ncontext, and exogenous shocks, notably economic crises.\nInstitutional  design  is  crucial  in  enabling  collaborating \ngovernments  to  overcome  the  liabilities  and  constraints  of  their \nparticular regional settings. Decision rules influence an institution\u2019s \ntradeoff between commitment and decisiveness, as well as ensure \nthat  discontented  minorities  do  not  defect.  Several  commitment \nmechanisms embedded in regional institutions serve to preserve \nbargains  and  discourage  defection:  the  mobilization  of  high-level \npolitical  commitments,  legalization,  and  delegation  to  regional \nauthorities. The enfranchisement of pro-cooperation interests outside \nthe circle of governments\u2014whether corporations, nongovernmental \norganizations, or individuals\u2014serves the same purpose. Membership \nrules are critical to the widening of regional institutions and integration; \nthe choice of membership model also serves to preserve the original \ncooperative bargains.\nFor integrating Asia, designing effective regional institutions for \nthe consolidation, deepening, and widening of economic integration \nis paramount. Is the creation, redesign, or strengthening of regional \ninstitutions  essential  for  this  critical  economic  agenda?  If  the \neconomic benefits from these regional institutions are substantial, will \nthose benefits outweigh the perceived loss of sovereign autonomy in \nsetting national policies? An answer to these questions requires first \nan audit of Asia\u2019s existing (and changing) institutional architecture \n(Chapter 4), and then a comparison of Asia\u2019s institutional record with \nthe experience of other regions (Chapter 5).\n111", "", "Chapter 4\nAnatomy of Institutions  \nfor Regional Integration", "Chapter 4\nAnatomy of Institutions  \nfor Regional Integration\nW\nhile  regional  cooperation  in  Asia  is  often \ndescribed  as  \u201cinstitution-light,\u201d  Asia  in  fact \nhosts a dense web of regional institutions and \narrangements\u2014albeit  ones  that  tend  to  have \nfew delegated powers.

Overarching  IRIs  are  umbrella  arrangements  with \ncomprehensive purviews. They may be based on a vision of an \nintegrated regional economy and creating a single regional market \nand  regional  community.  They  convene  summits  of  heads  of \ngovernment/state and/or ministerial-level meetings, and provide the \nnormative and declaratory frameworks that legitimize and support \nregional cooperation and integration. This study\u2019s stocktaking exercise \nlists 10 overarching organizations in Asia and the Pacific. Examples \ninclude ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) at the subregional \nlevel; ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN+3) and the East Asia Summit (EAS) \nat the intraregional level; and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) at the transregional level.\n115", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nAsia\u2019s overarching IRIs have a number of common attributes. They \nare intergovernmental arrangements that typically make decisions \nbased on consensus rather than majority voting. Their mandates and \nmodalities are largely advisory: in many cases they are consultative \nforums whose agreements lack legal force rather than regulatory \nagencies empowered to regulate their members\u2019 behavior in legally \nbinding ways. Notable exceptions, in some areas, include APEC and \narguably ASEAN, although their agreements tend to be non-binding. \nFew have dispute-settlement mechanisms. Although most overarching \nIRIs enjoy the direct involvement of heads of state and/or government \nthrough regular summits, national agencies usually delegate little \npower  or  authority  to  these  organizations  and  their  established \nsecretariats tend to have limited financial and human resources. \nTable 4.1 highlights the features of Asia\u2019s various overarching IRIs.\nHow  do  overarching  organizations  in  the  various  subregions \ncompare? Despite the apparent complexity and comprehensiveness \nof  regional  cooperation  in  Southeast  Asia,  ASEAN  involves  little \ndelegation, relying on \u201coffshoots\u201d rather than independent agencies \nto implement policy, as Section 4.2 explains. With its charter, however, \nASEAN has begun to shift from a purely deliberative, process-oriented \narrangement towards a more rules-based, regulatory, and results-\noriented one, although it still makes decisions by flexible consensus.\nPIF  is  also  intergovernmental,  with  deliberative  remits,  but  it \ndisplays a greater semblance of delegation and arguably a slightly \nmore  systematic  feedback  mechanism\u2014the  Regional  Institutional \nFramework\u2014than other overarching institutions, including ASEAN. While \nSouth Asia\u2019s IRIs are in general smaller and weaker than those in other \nsubregions, SAARC involves, in certain respects, slightly more delegation \nthan ASEAN. Its regional centers enjoy greater budget autonomy than \nthe various offshoots of ASEAN that manage similar areas of technical \ncooperation.53 On paper, SAARC\u2019s secretariat has a similar, if not more \nextensive, remit than ASEAN\u2019s does.

Their objective \nis to solve those problems through collective action, as well as by \nexchanging and adopting best practices. In doing so, they develop \norganizational structures that help sustain regional cooperation. As a \nconsequence, functional IRIs that enjoy some measure of delegation\u2014\n54  The ASEAN Regional Forum, a security institution, is also classified as a functional IRI.\n117", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nparticularly institutions in the Pacific and South Asia\u2014are arguably \nmore \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d processes.\nThere are a host of such institutions in Asia and the Pacific: this \nstudy\u2019s stocktaking exercise identified as many as 28. These are \nusually created without a lofty \u201cidea of region\u201d in mind, but they can \nhelp create a habit of regional cooperation and perhaps also regional \nconfidence building. Both are essential elements of regionalism. In \nmany ways, the attributes and features of functional IRIs differ little \nfrom those of overarching ones (Table 4.2).\nFacilitating. Facilitating institutions are organizations that bolster \nregional integration by providing advisory, administrative, technical, \nand  financial  support  (Abe  2009).  In  a  sense,  they  are  \u201cservice \nproviders\u201d for regional cooperation and integration. At the global \nlevel,  facilitating  institutions  include  the  World  Bank,  the  United \nNations Development Programme and others that support regional \nand subregional initiatives. At the pan-Asian level, the two facilitating \nIRIs are the United Nations (UN) Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nwhich are discussed in greater detail in Section 4.5.\nESCAP supports various programs and projects to strengthen \nregional economic integration in Asia and the Pacific, notably the \nAsian Highway and the Trans-Asian Railway programs. It also provides \nexpert advice to government agencies on economic development \nissues and supports trade facilitation programs and various capacity-\nbuilding efforts, often in collaboration with other institutions, including \naffiliated organizations from the UN system.\nADB also provides considerable resources and institutional support \nto regional cooperation and integration in Asia and the Pacific through \nseveral initiatives, including subregional programs\u2014organized and \nimplemented in collaboration with national and regional agencies\u2014\nsuch as the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) economic cooperation program, \nand the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC).\nIn geographical areas where overarching institutions are either \nweak or non-existent, facilitating IRIs play key roles, particularly as \n\u201chonest  brokers,\u201d  in  helping  functional  institutions  contribute  to \nregional cooperation and integration. However, strategic decisions on \nregionalism remain the purview of national governments and (to some \nextent) overarching IRIs, with facilitating IRIs striving instead to ensure \nthat ownership of the programs and initiatives they finance and support \nrests with national governments and civil society. Facilitating IRIs are also \nincreasingly called on by Asian countries to provide welfare assistance, \ntrust funds and other crisis-mitigating measures (Arner 2009).\n118", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \ne\nFeedback None None None  Yes None None None Yes None Yes  None Yes None None n next pag\nDispute  Settlement None Yes,   informal  None  None Yes None  None  Yes Yes  None  None  None None None continued o\nat\nSecretari Yes  Limited Limited  Yes  Limited Limited Yes Yes Yes  Limited  Limited Yes Yes  Yes\nn\no\nDelegati Weak Minimal Minimal Strong Minimal Minimal Minimal Strong Minimal  Minimal Minimal Weak Strong Minimal\nDecision- making Consensus Consensus Consensus Qualified  majority and  consensus  Consensus Consensus  Consensus  Qualified  majority and  consensus  Consensus  Consensus  Consensus  Consensus Qualified  majority and  consensus Consensus\nng ng ng ng ng ng ng ng ng ng ng ng ng ng\ndi di di di di di di di di di di di di di\nn n n n n n n n n n n n n n\ns bi bi bi bi bi bi bi bi bi bi bi bi bi bi\nule on- on- on- on- on- on- on- on- on- on- on- on- on- on-\nR N N N N N N N N N N N N N N\ne e e/ e e e  e  e e  e  e e e\nMandate/ Modality Advisory Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ Advisory Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ Deliberativ\ne Pacific Level Summit, officials Ministerial Summit, ministe- rial Officials Ministerial, of- ficials Governors\u2019  Symposium and  Meeting Ministerial,   officials Officials Summit, ministe- rial, officials Governors\u2019  Meeting Government,  private sector Summit, officials Summit, officials,  private sector Summit, officials\nsia and th Form  Declaration Charter Charter Declaration Treaty Meeting of  governors of  central banks  Declaration Charter Charter Meeting of  governors of  central banks Charter Program Agreement Program\nA\ns of Functional IRIs in  ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Indian Ocean Rim   Association for Regional   Cooperation (IORARC)  Shanghai Cooperation  Organisation (SCO) ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic  Research Office (AMRO) Bay of Bengal Initiative for  Multi-Sectoral Technical  and Economic Cooperation  (BIMSTEC) Central Banks of Southeast  Asia, New Zealand, and   Australia (SEANZA) Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI)  Credit Guarantee and   Investment Facility (CGIF) Economic Cooperation   Organization (ECO) Executives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia  Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) Network of Asian River Basin  Organizations (NARBO) Central Asia Regional Economic  Cooperation (CAREC) International Fund for Saving  the Aral Sea (IFAS)  United Nations Special  Programme for the Economies  of Central Asia (SPECA)\ne a\nur Asi\neat ntral \nF e\nTable 4.2.

ASEAN and Other Southeast \nAsian IRIs\nEstablished in 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nand Thailand, ASEAN was the first regional institution in Asia comprised \nsolely of indigenous Asian powers.55 It has since expanded so that by \n1999 it included all ten countries in Southeast Asia. (Timor-Leste, which \nachieved independence from Indonesia in 2002, has stated its intention \nto join the group in due course.) What began as a modest institution \nfocusing  on  economic  and  security  cooperation  is  now  arguably \none of the most successful expressions of regional cooperation in \nthe developing world, one based on the principles of openness and \ngradualism\u2014and a model of soft regionalism and intergovernmental \ncooperation for other overarching institutions in Asia and the Pacific.\nThe  traditional  \u201cASEAN  way\u201d  involved  cooperation  through \ninformal understandings that impose no legally binding obligations, \nbased on the principles of non-interference in national affairs and equal \nbudget contributions. However, cooperation within ASEAN is starting \nto become more rules-based and more formally institutionalized. \nWhile this shift remains tentative and incomplete, ASEAN leaders \nhave recently introduced some important innovations. Since 2003, \nthey have sought to establish an ASEAN Community comprising three \n\u201cpillars\u201d: the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), to be created by \n2015, and the ASEAN Political-Security Community56 and the ASEAN \nSocio-Cultural Community, both of which are expected to be fully \noperative by 2020. In 2005, ASEAN leaders began drafting a charter, \nwhich came into force in 2008, for the organization to strengthen its \ninstitutional pillars, bolster efforts to achieve the ASEAN Community, \nand give greater legal force to its international commitments. Thus \nASEAN is gradually shifting from being an organization based on \npolitical dialogue to one with an international legal status, involving \nbinding commitments, and that is better equipped to respond to the \nemerging regional and global challenges (Severino 2009).\nASEAN\u2019s highest decision-making body was initially the foreign \nministers\u2019 meeting. In 1976 and 1977, ASEAN leaders\u2019 first and second \nsummits raised the organization\u2019s international profile. Building on the \n55  Non-Asian countries participated in the Bandung Conference, organized in 1955, in the \nSoutheast Asia Treaty Organization, which lasted from 1955 until 1977, and are members of \nthe Secretariat of the Pacific Community, established in 1947 and still active.\n56  Formerly known as the ASEAN Security Community. \n121", "Institutions for Regional Integration\n1971 Declaration on Southeast Asia as a Zone of Peace, Freedom and \nNeutrality (ZOPFAN), ASEAN agreed its first treaty, the Treaty of Amity \nand Cooperation (TAC). Together, these enabled ASEAN to formulate \nbasic norms and principles to govern relations among states in the \nregion as well as with external powers. However, political tensions \nbetween Malaysia and the Philippines prevented a third summit being \nheld until 1987 and economic initiatives in these first two decades \nachieved relatively few results.57 Eventually, ASEAN got a new lease of \nlife when in 1992 leaders decided to create the ASEAN Free Trade Area \n(AFTA). Thereafter ASEAN leaders met again every three years until \n2001, since when they have held summits annually.\nASEAN\u2019s secretariat initially had limited powers, since national \ngovernments  did  not  want  to  cede  control  over  the  institution\u2019s \ndevelopment.58 Since the mid-1980s, however, successive eminent-\npersons groups\u2019 reports have argued that it ought be strengthened\u2014and \nit now has many more powers than a decade ago as well as a broader \npool of professional staff. However, it still lacks financial and human \nresources,59 and the powers that national agencies have delegated to \nit remain limited to managing the (as-yet-unused) dispute-settlement \nmechanism and monitoring the implementation of the AEC (through \na scorecard mechanism which is meant to exert peer pressure on \nmembers when their performance falls short of their commitments). \nThe issue of dispute settlement within ASEAN is analyzed in greater \ndetail in Box 4.1.\nAs its agenda has expanded, ASEAN has become a much more \ncomplex institution. Until the 1980s, it had a simple organizational \nstructure involving the five original members and Brunei Darussalam, \nwhich  joined  in  1984.  Its  projects,  which  focused  on  economic \ncooperation, were initiated and managed by committees comprising \ngovernment  officials.  Yet  these  projects  had  scarcely  any  impact \non  Southeast  Asia\u2019s  growing  economic  integration,  which  was \nmostly driven by individual countries\u2019 own liberalization policies and \nsupported by increased foreign direct investment (FDI) by multinational \ncompanies from non-ASEAN economies. However, ASEAN was quite \n57  The key initiatives in the economic field began with the ASEAN Preferential Trade Agreement \nand the ASEAN Industrial Projects in 1977. They were followed by the ASEAN Industrial Joint \nVenture, the ASEAN Industrial Complementation, and other schemes, all with disappointing \nresults.\n58  The Secretariat was set up in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 1976 by ASEAN\u2019s foreign \nministers. \n59  Major ASEAN decision-making bodies, in addition to the Leaders\u2019 Summit, are Senior \nOfficials Meetings in various areas and High-Level Task Forces created for specific needs \nand activities.

In addition, while the secretary-general\u2019s role in \nmonitoring compliance has been enhanced, the position will continue \nto be non-renewable and rotate alphabetically among member states.60\nReforms are also needed in other areas. The system of equal \nfinancial contributions has held the secretariat\u2019s operational budget \nhostage to the group\u2019s smallest economies. The consensus rule can \nhamstring decision-making. The ASEAN Secretariat continues to have \ndifficulty recruiting qualified staff and thus strengthening its institutional \ncapacity, partly on account of the shortness of tenure offered. In the \nabsence of a strong central authority, ASEAN continues to rely primarily \non the collective will of its member states, their perceived national \ninterests, and peer pressure to ensure compliance with its agreements \nand decisions.\nCreating the AEC and making it a viable instrument to support \nsustainable and equitable growth among ASEAN members is the \nbiggest challenge. A majority of Asian opinion leaders interviewed in \nthe survey conducted for this study expressed concerns on the capacity \nto start the AEC by 2015 (see Appendix 1). In order to ensure a smooth \nand timely AEC start, ASEAN leaders have agreed to implement several \nliberalization and harmonization efforts and to establish an ASEAN \nInfrastructure Fund with an initial capital of $800 million. At the 2010 \nHanoi Summit they adopted a Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity. \nThis aims to facilitate the realization of the AEC by enhancing regional \ninfrastructure  development,  improving  economic  efficiency,  and \neventually narrowing the income gap among and within members.\nASEAN Functional Initiatives\nASEAN organizes functional cooperation in Southeast Asia in a wide \nrange of areas through various agencies that implement regional \nprograms under its umbrella. Examples include the Centre for Energy \nand the Centre for Biodiversity, both of which originate from programs \nundertaken with the European Union (EU) and are governed by boards \n60  In the case of the deputy secretaries-general, two of the positions will continue to rotate \nalphabetically among member states, while the other two will be \u201copenly recruited based \non merit.\u201d\n125", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nmade up of ASEAN senior officials and the ASEAN secretary-general. \nOther bodies of this nature include the Earthquake Information Centre, \nthe Coordinating Centre for Transboundary Haze Pollution, and the \nSpecialized Meteorological Centre in areas related to the environment; \nand the Centre for the Development of Agricultural Cooperatives and \nthe Council on Petroleum in areas of industrial development. ASEAN \nhas  also  established  its  own  foundation  to  handle  funding  from \nexternal parties and other contributions from donors. In education and \ncapacity building, the group has also established the ASEAN University \nNetwork and the Insurance Training and Research Institute. Another \nimportant group in the field of education is the Southeast Asian \nMinisters of Education Organization, which predates ASEAN. This \nalso includes Timor-Leste and several advanced countries from the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as \nassociate members.\nAmong the various functional initiatives for economic cooperation \nintroduced by ASEAN so far, AFTA is the most successful one. Launched \nin 1992 to increase the group\u2019s \u201ccompetitive advantage as a production \nbase geared for the world market\u201d (ASEAN 2003), AFTA has worked \nas an effective tool to promote trade liberalization, institutionalize a \nconstructive dialogue among its members, and introduce a practice of \nadhering to reciprocal commitments. Earlier proposals for creating a \nfree trade area (FTA) led to no results because some ASEAN members \nwished to make their domestic markets more efficient before lowering \ntariff barriers. By the early 1990s, however, ASEAN countries were \nable to remove their major objections as they successfully undertook \ndomestic reforms. AFTA was seen as a way to lock in those reforms \nthrough regional commitments, especially for the most advanced \nmembers. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98 \nand in response to the rise of\u2014and increased competitive challenge \nfrom\u2014the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  India,  AFTA\u2019s \nimplementation was accelerated. This was followed by the decision \nto establish the ASEAN Community in 2003, which consolidates all \nearlier agreements into a more coherent plan to deepen regional \nintegration. In recent years, ASEAN has also signed FTAs with Australia, \nNew Zealand, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the PRC, and India. \nDiscussions are ongoing to identify common denominators among \nthese FTAs and work towards their consolidation under a region-wide \ntrade and investment agreement (see Section 4.4).\n126", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nOther Functional IRIs in Southeast Asia\nThis  study\u2019s  stocktaking  covers  five  additional  functional  IRIs  in \nSoutheast  Asia:  the  Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines  East \nASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA); the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS)  Economic  Cooperation  Program;  the  Indonesia-Malaysia-\nThailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT); the Mekong River Commission \n(MRC); and the Southeast Asian Water Utilities Network (SEAWUN). \nAll are linked to ASEAN, are building blocks towards achieving the AEC \nmainly through the realization of infrastructure connectivity projects, \nand receive support, in varying degrees, from ADB.

Countries began to implement programs for regional \ncooperation in developing poles of economic growth across border \nterritories. IMT-GT and BIMP-EAGA were inspired by an earlier initiative \nthat included Singapore, the state of Johor in Malaysia, and the Riau \nIslands of Indonesia.

IRIs in Other Asian Subregions\nCentral Asia. This is the only subregion in Asia that lacks an indigenous \noverarching institution. As Central Asian countries that emerged from \nthe breakup of the Soviet Union had to focus on building (or rebuilding) \ntheir national identities, regional cooperation has struggled to become \nthe priority it ought to be. Even so, recent progress has been substantial.\nNone of ADB\u2019s members from Central Asia\u2014Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \nand Uzbekistan\u2014host the secretariat of a major regional IRI: the \nEurasian Economic Community (EurAsEc) is based in Moscow, Russian \nFederation, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Beijing, \nthe PRC, and the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), which \nbring together non-Arab Islamic countries, in Tehran, Iran. Central Asia \nis, however, home to three functional IRIs\u2014the CAREC Program, the \nInternational Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), and the United Nations \nSpecial Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA).65\nA  program  involving  a  partnership  between  eight  countries \nand six multilateral institutions, CAREC has evolved into the most \neffective functional IRI in Central Asia by adopting a gradual strategy \nand encouraging ownership by member countries, and thanks to the \ndeployment of substantial resources from ADB, including financial \nand staffing support. Other factors behind its success are that it \npresents no serious threat to the sovereignty of its members, and \nthat the membership of a large neighbor (the PRC) is welcomed \nrather than feared. While ADB, as the lead institution, has devoted \nconsiderable effort to acting as CAREC\u2019s secretariat,66 the presence \nof other major multilateral institutions brings in potential donors \nand alleviates concerns of domination by an outside body. CAREC\u2019s \nactivities aim to improve connectivity, share natural resources more \nefficiently, shorten transit times across national borders for traded \ngoods, and introduce clear, consistent trade regimes. In 2006, it \nadopted its Comprehensive Action Plan that proposed a results-\noriented program with tangible targets and outputs, based on country \nownership, pragmatic approaches, and mutual accountability, and \nfocused on four priority areas: transport, trade facilitation, trade policy, \nand energy (Pomfret 2009).\nSPECA  has  so  far  had  less  impact  in  promoting  regionalism \nin  Central  Asia.

Until recently, economic cooperation in Northeast \nAsia  was  mostly  driven  by  a  few  functional  initiatives,  although \ncountries have also acted through the Six-Party Talks to address \nsecurity concerns related to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \n(DPRK). Wider and more ambitious cooperation programs have lagged \nbehind other subregions because of remaining historical animosities \namong regional members and a preference for bilateralism. However, \nthe PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea have started to strengthen \ntheir economic cooperation initiatives within ASEAN+3 (described \nin Section 4.4), which was formed in response to the 1997/98 Asian \nfinancial crisis. While leaders of these \u201cPlus Three\u201d countries have \nbeen meeting on the sidelines of ASEAN+3 meetings since 1999, they \nalso formalized their higher-level cooperation in December 2008 with \nthe launch of the Trilateral Summit (TS), an embryonic but promising \noverarching IRI.\nThe TS has already spurred cooperation among think tanks in the \nthree countries to explore modalities for economic cooperation, including \nthe desirability and feasibility of a free trade area.67 Since the first official \nmeeting of leaders from the three TS countries in 2008, the group\u2019s \nagenda has expanded to include security and environmental protection. \nThe PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea have also committed 80% \nof the funding for the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) \nand, given their economic importance, are likely to play a key role in the \n67  Kikuchi (2009) argues that a successful Trilateral Summit could supplant the ASEAN+3 or \nEAS as the focus of regional integration, while cautioning that it is an institution that is still \nin search of identity.\n131", "Institutions for Regional Integration\ndevelopment of broader region-wide institutions.

The UN secretariat responsible for the GTI is based in Beijing, PRC. \nWhile the GTI was not very active in its first decade, more recently GTI \nleaders have identified four energy-based activities as key components \nin its Strategic Action Plan for 2006\u20132015: energy policy coordination \nand  cooperation;  capacity  building;  enhancing  transparency;  and \npartnership building. GTI activities are carried out through the help of \nenergy  commissions,  financial  institutions,  research  institutes,  and \nother relevant bodies (Gulidov 2009). While the GTI has great economic \npotential, political divisions and the DPRK\u2019s attitude towards nuclear \npolicy make cooperation quite difficult.

The South Pacific Commission was the first formal \nregional arrangement in Asia and the Pacific. It was established in 1947 \nby the region\u2019s colonial powers to coordinate research on economic \nand social development. Now known as the Secretariat of the Pacific \nCommunity (SPC), its membership includes all 22 independent states \nand territories in the Pacific region plus Australia, France, New Zealand \nand the United States (US). While it is overseen by a governing council \nconsisting of heads of state and government, it remains a non-political \nbody that specializes in providing technical advice, including data on \neconomic and social development and the management of natural \nresources.\nThe  subregion\u2019s  overarching  institution  is  the  PIF\u2014previously \nknown as the South Pacific Forum. It is the forum where political \ndecisions are taken and its membership is limited to 16 sovereign \nstates. Its annual Forum Leaders Meeting seeks to develop collective \nresponses to regional issues. Decisions are reached by consensus. The \nPacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), based in Suva, Fiji Islands, \ndevelops policies and a work program based on leaders\u2019 decisions and \nis also charged with their implementation. The PIFS grew out of the \nSouth Pacific Bureau for Economic Cooperation (SPEC), an organization \nfounded in 1973 to foster economic cooperation and trade in the region.\n132", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nThe PIFS has a stronger mandate from national governments than \nthe ASEAN Secretariat. In addition to its role in harmonizing regional \npositions on various political and policy issues, the PIFS has technical \nprograms that cover economic development, transport, and trade. \nIt has four divisions\u2014development and economic policy; trade and \ninvestment; political, international, and legal matters; and corporate \nservices\u2014each with direct responsibility for a range of programs to \nimprove the capacity of PIF member countries and coordinate action \non matters of common interest. PIFS has a secretary general, and \nits activities are overseen by a governing body, the Forum Officials \nCommittee, made up of PIF government representatives.\nThe PIF\u2019s agenda focuses on schemes to pool resources across the \nPacific\u2019s often tiny states. Priorities include infrastructure development \nand regional connectivity. Implementation is undertaken by functional \nIRIs  such  as  the  SPC,  the  Pacific  Islands  Applied  Geoscience \nCommission (SOPAC), and others. PIF members have formed free-\ntrade agreements, namely the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic \nRelations (PACER) and the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement \n(PICTA). However, as their implementation has been less successful \nthan planned, PIF members have responded by seeking to consolidate \nthe activities of IRIs in the Pacific through the creation of the Pacific \nPlan\u2014an overarching agreement endorsed by PIF leaders in 2005 \nto unite the region\u2019s trade-integration efforts (PACER and PICTA) \nand to promote broader development aspirations. The Pacific Plan \nhas also proposed consolidating the subregion\u2019s IRIs into a regional \norganization structure based on three pillars: a political one based on \nPIF, a technical one focused on SPC, and an academic one comprising \ninstitutions such as the South Pacific Board for Educational Assessment, \nand the University of the South Pacific (Chand 2009).\nThe study\u2019s stocktaking exercise counts five functional IRIs in \nthe Pacific that play a role in developing and implementing regional \ncooperation programs. These institutions tend to focus on specific \nareas of cooperation, such as fisheries (the Forum Fisheries Agency\u2014\nFFA), the environment (the Pacific Regional Environment Programme\u2014\nSPREP), applied geoscience (SOPAC), and tourism (the Pacific Tourism \nOrganization), in addition to technical support provided by SCP in \nseveral areas. Not all are delegated tasks by the PIF, although some \nemerged as offshoots from it. All these functional institutions rely heavily \non donor funding and are therefore beholden to the agendas of their \nmajor sponsors. They often compete for the same sources of funds, \nshifting accountability for deliverables from clients to donors.

In particular, the CROP conducts \na review of Pacific IRIs\u2019 effectiveness under the Regional Institutional \nFramework. This exercise, started as one of the initiatives to implement \nthe Pacific Plan, seeks to develop an effective feedback mechanism \nwhich in many respects appears to be more systematic than ASEAN\u2019s \nad hoc review processes (Chand 2009).\nSouth Asia. South Asia\u2019s overarching IRI is SAARC, which includes \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, \nplus Afghanistan (which joined in 2007). Launched in 1985 as South \nAsian Regional Cooperation (SARC), SAARC has a secretariat located \nin Kathmandu, Nepal. SAARC\u2019s creation has been described as \u201can \nact of faith\u201d given the absence of a shared security threat and the \nextremely low levels of intraregional trade and investment (Baru \n2009). Tensions and conflicts in South Asia remain a major obstacle to \nregional cooperation.\nSAARC began life as a low-profile intergovernmental institution, \nserved by a small secretariat. Its founding charter provides for an \nannual leaders\u2019 summit, but does not explicitly define its function. \nThe  Council  of  (Foreign)  Ministers  is  entrusted  with  formulating \npolicies, reviewing progress, and making decisions on new areas of \ncooperation, as well as establishing implementation mechanisms as \nnecessary. It is assisted by a standing committee consisting of senior \nofficials  from  members\u2019  foreign  ministries.  Technical  committees \nimplement, coordinate, and monitor the progress of SAARC\u2019s activities. \nThis is similar to ASEAN\u2019s early institutional structure.\nUntil 1991, SAARC\u2019s role in trade liberalization was practically \nnonexistent.  With  the  SAARC  Preferential  Trading  Arrangement \n(SAPTA), signed in 1993 and entered into force since 1995, SAARC \nhas gathered momentum by focusing on opportunities for economic \ncooperation and collaboration with civil society. The SAARC Secretariat \nalso prioritizes regional connectivity and human development, while \nit has more recently started to play a role in coordinating members\u2019 \npolicy responses to external shocks such as the 2008/09 global crisis. \nHowever, the implementation of SAARC\u2019s South Asia Free Trade Area \n(SAFTA), signed in 2004 and entered into force since 2006, has so far \ndone little to boost intraregional trade.\n134", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nBased on a recommendation from an eminent-persons group, \nSAARC has started working towards the formation of a more effective \nfree  trade  area  by  2016.  Under  an  early-harvest  program,  India, \nPakistan, and Sri Lanka have reduced customs duties on imports from \nleast-developed countries to below 5% from January 2009. Especially \nsince the 1980s, all SAARC economies have introduced trade policy \nand other reforms and become more outward-oriented. However, \nSAFTA faces many hurdles, not least political ones (such as the refusal \nby Pakistan and Bangladesh to grant India transit rights).\nSAARC\u2019s  technical  committees  (and  working  groups)  bring \ntogether experts from member countries in areas such as infrastructure, \nscience and technology, human development, and energy. A key \ninstitutional innovation is the creation of 13 \u201cregional centers\u201d\u2014all \noffshoots of SAARC\u2014which focus on specific programs to facilitate \nregional cooperation at the ground level. Each center\u2019s capital cost and \nadministrative budget are borne by the respective host country, which \ngives them a degree of autonomy, while program budgets are shared \nby all member governments in proportion to their gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). These regional centers are overseen by the SAARC \nSecretariat, which reports on their activities to the SAARC Summit. \nThe centers\u2019 activities are approved by the Program Committee and \nthe SAARC Summit, while implementation responsibility rests with \nhost-country governments. Ostensibly, then, SAARC involves rather \nextensive delegation to separate institutions. Baru (2009) argues that \nthe proliferation of these regional centers seems to be a reaction to \nthe slow progress of SAARC itself. Box 4.3 considers how trade within \nSouth Asia and with East Asia might be liberalized.\nTo sum up, there are many IRIs in the five subregions of Asia \nand the Pacific. All have an overarching IRI except Central Asia, \nwhere a functional IRI is at the center of regional cooperation. While \nsubregional IRIs have achieved a lot, politics and capacity constraints \nremain big hurdles to closer cooperation.\n4.4. Intraregional Institutions\nIn the wider Asian context, this study\u2019s stocktaking exercise identifies \n11 intraregional IRIs: two overarching and nine functional.

While ASEAN\u2019s importance \nis enhanced by its balancing function among big regional players \nsuch as the PRC and Japan, those big players also shape the agenda \nof ASEAN+3, as does the Republic of Korea. Within the EAS, India \nis also important, as is Australia. The EAS connects countries from \nfour different subregions\u2014Southeast, Northeast, and South Asia, plus \nOceania\u2014going beyond the East Asia-only members of ASEAN+3. In \na sense, then, the creation of EAS in December 2005 can be seen as a \nfirst step towards a broader pan-Asian institution.\nThis study identifies ESCAP and ADB as the only two existing pan-\nAsian IRIs (discussed in the next section). While the Central Banks of \nSouth East Asia, New Zealand, and Australia (SEANZA) brings together \n20 countries and 24 central banks covering different Asian subregions, \nit lacks members from Central Asia. The importance of developing \nnew pan-Asian institutions and forums is discussed in Chapter 6.\nIntraregional  functional  IRIs  include  different  types  of  groups \npromoting economic development and cooperation such as the Bay of \nBengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation \n(BIMSTEC), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), and the \nShanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO); institutions for financial \ncooperation such as the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office \n(AMRO), the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF), the \nExecutives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), and \nSEANZA, as well as agencies providing regional public goods such as \nthe Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) and the Network of Asian River Basin \nOrganizations (NARBO). A brief discussion of these institutions is offered \nafter reviewing Asia\u2019s overarching intraregional IRIs.\n68  The idea of an \u201cASEAN complex\u201d of institutions is from Haggard (2009). \n137", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nOverarching Intraregional IRIs\nASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN+3). ASEAN+3 is the IRI most representative \nof East Asia geographically, since the PRC, Japan and the Republic of \nKorea participate actively with the ten ASEAN countries to promote \nregional cooperation and integration in the wider East Asian region. It is \nAsia\u2019s most advanced intraregional venture: it has pursued collaboration \nin 20 or more areas, notably financial matters, giving grist to the \nsuggestion that it ought to continue serving as East Asia\u2019s \u201cintegrative \ncenter\u201d and vanguard institution for regional integration (Dent 2009). \nHowever,  the  ASEAN+3  process  remains  weakly  institutionalized: \nit does not have its own secretariat and only a small unit in the ASEAN \nSecretariat is in charge of addressing ASEAN+3 matters.\nASEAN+3 has diverse origins. The idea of creating an East Asian \nregional grouping\u2014initially named the East Asian Economic Group \n(EAEG),  and  subsequently  changed  to  the  East  Asian  Economic \nCaucus (EAEC)\u2014was first mooted in 1990 by the then Prime Minister \nof Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad. Beyond a few informal exploratory \nmeetings, the EAEG or EAEC did not materialize, in part due to APEC\u2019s \ngrowth momentum, but also because the confrontational manner in \nwhich Prime Minister Mahathir at times pushed the idea did not help \nhis cause.\nCoordination among ASEAN countries and the PRC, Japan, and \nthe Republic of Korea for the ASEM process paved the way for an \nembryonic regionalism at the East Asia\u2013wide level. In the wake of the \n1997/98 Asian financial crisis, the need for closer financial cooperation, \nregional solidarity, and a stronger regional voice in the international \narena was increasingly felt. ASEAN took the initiative by inviting the \nheads of state/government of the three Northeast Asian countries to \nits 1997 summit. The ASEAN+3 process was formalized in 1999 with \nan agenda initially focused on financial cooperation. In this area, the \ntwo main initiatives that have emerged from the ASEAN+3 process are \nthe Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) and the Asian Bond Markets Initiative \n(ABMI), discussed in Chapter 2 (Arner 2009, Gochoco-Bautista 2009).\nThe CMI, a bilateral swap arrangement among Asian currencies \ninvolving the region\u2019s monetary authorities, was established in 2000 \nto deal with liquidity shortfalls and short-term balance of payments \ndifficulties.  The  transformation  of  bilateral  swap  arrangements \ninto a single contractual, multilateral agreement, through the CMI \nMultilateralization  (CMIM)  process,  has  raised  the  prominence \nof ASEAN+3, with important implications in terms of the greater \ninstitutionalization of East Asia\u2019s IRIs.

The CMIM officially came into \neffect on 24 March 2010 and in early May ASEAN+3 finance ministers \ndecided to create the CMIM regional surveillance agency, the ASEAN+3 \nMacroeconomic  Research  Office  (AMRO),  which  is  expected  to \nbecome operative from May 2011 (see below and Chapter 2).\nThe  ABMI,  which  began  in  2002,  was  designed  to  promote \nthe  development  of  local  currency\u2013denominated  bond  markets, \nstrengthen Asia\u2019s financial market infrastructure, and increase access \nto regional bond markets by Asian investors. In particular, ABMI seeks \nto develop more efficient, diversified, and liquid capital markets in the \nregion so as to better meet its investment needs and boost economic \ndevelopment (see Chapter 2).69\nThe ASEAN+3 process has also facilitated regional cooperation \nin trade and investment. For example, at the ASEAN+3 summit in \n2001, the PRC and ASEAN formally announced that they would start \ntalks on a free trade agreement. The Republic of Korea used the \nsame summit to propose a free trade area spanning East Asia, while \nthe PRC proposed the establishment of an East Asia Free Trade Area \n(EAFTA) involving all ASEAN+3 economies, as well as a trilateral \nFTA for Northeast Asia comprising PRC, Japan, and the Republic of \nKorea (Stubbs 2002). Progress towards an EAFTA has, however, been \nslow; at the 2009 ASEAN+3 summit, feasibility studies were still being \nconsidered (ASEAN 2009c). Consolidating the tangled noodle bowl of \nFTAs into a single East Asia\u2013wide FTA would benefit the region but \nremains a challenge.\nEast Asia Summit (EAS). In December 2005, an enlarged \u201cEast \nAsian\u201d process came into existence with the creation of the EAS, \nextending the membership of ASEAN+3 to include Australia, India, \nand New Zealand (hence why EAS is also known as ASEAN+6). The \nEAS is a deliberative, consensus-based and process-oriented IRI that \nremains weakly institutionalized. Like ASEAN+3 and ARF, it does not \nhave its own secretariat, relying instead on ASEAN\u2019s.\n69  Meanwhile, however, many Asian developing economies\u2014notably the PRC and India\u2014have \nnot yet fully deregulated their capital accounts, creating an obstacle to the development of \nregional financial markets.\n139", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nAt its first summit it was agreed that the EAS would be a leaders-led \ndialogue process on strategic issues affecting the region. Its agenda has \nsince expanded rapidly to include energy, trade, and climate change \nissues. More recently, there has been discussion about expanding the \nEAS to include the United States and the Russian Federation.\nKey players in the region have been discussing the division of labor \namong institutions with overlapping memberships, such as ASEAN, \nASEAN+3, and the EAS. It has been suggested that ASEAN take the \nlead in regional infrastructure development, ASEAN+3 in financial \nsector development and regional cooperation, and EAS in trade and \ninvestment cooperation through the proposed creation of a wide \nregional free trade zone, or the Comprehensive Economic Partnership \nin East Asia (CEPEA).\nFunctional Intraregional IRIs\nBay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic \nCooperation (BIMSTEC).

BIMSTEC \nhas no secretariat and its activities are coordinated by Thailand\u2019s foreign \nministry, but preparations are being made for the establishment of a \npermanent secretariat. Its first summit was held in 2004.\nBIMSTEC\u2019s agenda is purely economic, ranging from trade and \ninvestment initiatives, projects for regional infrastructure development, \nand cooperation to deliver regional public goods. It has so far selected \n13 priority sectors for cooperation, each led by one of the member \ncountries, on a voluntary basis. A key area for cooperation is the \nimplementation of cross-border infrastructure in areas that represent \nimportant  nodes  for  economic  development  and  strengthening \ncommon  initiatives  to  link  South  and  Southeast  Asian  countries. \nProjects were recently started to improve transport infrastructure and \nlogistics and facilitate the flow of cross-border trade among member \ncountries. A BIMSTEC trade negotiations committee has also been \nestablished to pave the way for an eventual free trade area.\n140", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO). Founded in 1985 \nby Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan as a group of non-Arab Islamic countries, \nECO was expanded in 1992 after the Soviet Union\u2019s dissolution.

ECO\u2019s highest policy and decision-making body is the \nCouncil of (Foreign) Ministers, which meets annually. Its organizational \nstructure also includes a Council of Permanent Representatives, a \nRegional Planning Council, and a General Secretariat consisting of six \ndirectorates under the supervision of the Secretary General and deputy \nsecretaries general. The General Secretariat (located in Tehran, Iran) \nis also mandated to supervise the nine regional institutes70 and three \nspecialized agencies71 that ECO has committed to establish. The few \nthat have been established to date are all located in the three founding \nmembers, outside Central Asia. ECO aims to establish a single market \nfor goods and services through progressive trade liberalization among \nits members. However, little progress so far has been made. Pomfret \n(2009) argues that one fundamental obstacle to economic integration \nis the pronounced similarity of ECO economies, which all specialize in \na small group of primary products.\nShanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). SCO was established \nin 2001 and consists of six member countries: the PRC, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \nIndia, Iran, Mongolia, and Pakistan are observers. Its predecessor, the \nShanghai Five (which did not include Uzbekistan), was created in \n1996 to restructure the bilateral relationships between the PRC and the \nSoviet Union after the latter was dissolved. SCO\u2019s main functions are \nin the areas of security, energy, and economic cooperation, where the \nPRC acts as a hub for the group (Pomfret 2009). SCO\u2019s secretariat is \nlocated in Beijing, PRC. Its main organs are the Heads of State Council \nMeeting, the SCO Forum, and the SCO Business Council.\nThe normative principles followed by the SCO Charter stress, as in \nthe case of ASEAN, mutual trust, good neighborliness, and cooperation \nas a model of regional diplomacy and security.

The creation \nof  AMRO  was  officially  endorsed  by  ASEAN+3  finance  ministers \nduring their meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in May 2010. Singapore \nwas chosen as the host country of this new institution, which is \nexpected to become fully operational by May 2011 with an office \nof 8\u201310 professional staff. AMRO\u2019s governance structure and main \nresponsibilities were decided during the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019  \nMeeting in Bali, Indonesia, in 2009.\nAMRO\u2019s overall mandate is to conduct macroeconomic research \nand financial surveillance for ASEAN+3 countries with the ultimate aim \nof reviewing and providing an objective assessment of the repayment \nconditions for borrowing from the multilateralized CMI. The declared \nprinciples underlying AMRO\u2019s surveillance operations are meant to \nfacilitate regulatory cooperation, standard harmonization, enhanced \ntransparency, and multi-level governance (see Chapter 2 for more \ndetails).\nCredit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF). In April 2010, \nADB, together with the ASEAN+3 countries, established the CGIF, a \ntrust fund aimed at promoting financial stability and boosting long-\nterm investment in the region. The CGIF totals $700 million, of which \n$570 million comes from ASEAN+3 governments\u2014$200 million from the \nPRC, $200 million from Japan, $100 million from the Republic of Korea, \nand $70 million from ASEAN countries\u2014and $130 million from ADB.\nThe creation of this new facility is expected to help domestic \nfirms tap local currency and regional debt markets. The CGIF will \nthus help to mobilize regional savings to finance regional investment \nand also promote the harmonization of standards and practice for \nbond issuance, helping to integrate regional financial markets (see \nChapter 2 for more details).\n142", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nExecutives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). \nEMEAP was established 1991 among central banks and other monetary \nauthorities in East Asia and the Pacific, with the primary objective \nof strengthening the cooperative relationship among its members. It \nhas 11 members: the Reserve Bank of Australia, the People\u2019s Bank of \nChina, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank Indonesia, the Bank \nof Japan, the Bank of Korea, Bank Negara Malaysia, the Reserve Bank \nof New Zealand, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Monetary Authority \nof Singapore, and the Bank of Thailand. EMEAP plays a significant role \nin central bank coordination and cooperation, working closely with \nregional IRIs, such as ASEAN, ASEAN+3, EAS, ADB, other regional \ninstitutions  such  as  the  European  Central  Bank,  global  financial \ninstitutions  such  as  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  (BIS) \nand the Financial Stability Forum, and other international setters of \nfinancial standards.\nEMEAP does not have a formal secretariat. Instead, the member \nhosting the next governors\u2019 meeting is responsible for arrangements. \nThe Bank of Japan acts as a coordinating agency. Currently EMEAP \noperates through (i) the governors\u2019 meeting, held annually on a rotating \nhost base, (ii) deputies\u2019 meetings and meetings of the monetary and \nfinancial stability committee, and (iii) meetings of various working \ngroups,  including  ones  on  financial  market  development,  central \nbanking operations, and banking supervision. These three working \ngroups define the main areas of cooperation promoted by EMEAP \n(Arner 2009).\nOne  of  EMEAP\u2019s  most  high-profile  activities  has  been  the \npromotion of the Asian Bond Fund (ABF) initiative, with the first stage \nlaunched in 2003, the second in 2004, and future directions currently \nunder discussion. By investing in debt securities from Asian countries, \nthe aim of ABF is to widen market demand, enable borrowing in Asia\u2019s \ndomestic currencies, and reduce, in turn, financial and exchange-rate \nrisk by lowering the dependence on non-Asian financial markets. \nWhile the amounts invested by the ABF have remained limited, the \ninitiative has promoted dialogue and created structures for regional \nfinancial cooperation.\n4.5. Pan-Asian IRIs\nThe two pan-Asian IRIs included in this study\u2019s stocktaking exercise, \nESCAP and ADB, play an important role in facilitating and driving \nregionalism in Asia and the Pacific, as discussed in the subsection \n143", "Institutions for Regional Integration\non facilitating institutions in Section 4.1. They function as catalysts in \nareas where countries cannot efficiently perform their activities alone. \nThey also promote the institutionalization of regional cooperation by \nproviding knowledge products, ideas, and coordination, as well as by \ndisseminating information and conducting research on various topics.\nESCAP  and  ADB  have  also  contributed  to  the  promotion  of \ninvestment and trade in Asia and the Pacific in a variety of ways, \nincluding the creation of infrastructure networks and the introduction \nof programs for trade and investment facilitation. ESCAP provides \ncourses for e-government and ICT training. ADB provides technical \nassistance along the same lines. Both institutions are well placed \nto perform such activities, which prepare the ground for economic \nintegration, because of their wide membership, their high-quality staff, \nand the networks they have established.\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe Pacific (ESCAP). Established in 1947 as the Economic Commission \nfor Asia and the Far East to assist members of the region in postwar \neconomic reconstruction, ESCAP moved its headquarters to Bangkok, \nThailand, in January 1949. It is one of the five regional commissions \ncreated under the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.72 \nThe main legislative organ of ESCAP is the commission, which meets \nannually at the ministerial level and reports to the UN Economic and \nSocial Council.\nESCAP\u2019s overall objective is to promote inclusive and sustainable \neconomic and social development in the Asia and Pacific region, \nwith  priority  accorded  to  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Its major functions are to (i) promote economic \nand social development of its regional members through cooperation \nand integration, (ii) act as the primary UN economic and social \ndevelopment forum for the region, and (iii) formulate and promote \ndevelopment assistance activities and projects to meet the needs and \npriorities of the region, acting as the executing agency for relevant \noperational projects. The development of regional infrastructure as \nwell as trade cooperation and facilitation are the two major areas of \nESCAP\u2019s contribution to economic integration in Asia and the Pacific. \nGiven the wide scope and range of operations, ESCAP has also \nprompted the development of several offspring institutions that further \nfacilitate economic integration in the region (Abe 2009).\n72  The other four institutions are the Economic Commissions for Europe, Africa, Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean, plus the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia.\n144", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nESCAP provided an important early contribution to Asian economic \nintegration in the area of regional infrastructure development, by \nidentifying efficient and reliable international routes and networks, \nwhich implied either developing new infrastructure or upgrading \nexisting national and international infrastructure. ESCAP started the \nAsian Highway73 in 1959, with the aim of promoting the development \nof  international  road  transport  throughout  the  region,  and  the \nintegrated Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development (ALTID) \nin 1992, to further strengthen intra- and inter-regional transport and \ncommunication linkages, including in particular the Asian Highway \nnetwork. In the area of rail transport infrastructure, in the 1960s ESCAP \ninitiated the Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) project, aiming to reduce \ntransit times for goods and people between countries and regions \nacross Asia.\nIn the area of trade cooperation and facilitation, the 1975 Asia-Pacific \nTrade Agreement (APTA), previously named the Bangkok Agreement, \nis an ESCAP initiative to create a preferential tariff arrangement and \npromote intraregional trade through trade liberalization. With regard to \ntrade facilitation, ESCAP assists its member countries through capacity-\nbuilding programs that promote the simplification, harmonization, and \nstandardization of trade procedures in order to reduce the cost and \ntime of cross-border shipments.\nESCAP has also helped establish several other institutions for \nregional integration. The most prominent of such offspring institutions \nis ADB, which took shape from an ESCAP resolution in 1963. Other \ninstitutions ESCAP helped establish are the Mekong River Commission, \nthe  Asian  and  Pacific  Centre  for  Agricultural  Engineering  and \nMachinery, the UN Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information \nand Communication Technology for Development, the Asia and Pacific \nCenter for Transfer of Technology, and the Statistical Institute for Asia \nand the Pacific.\nAsian Development Bank (ADB). As Section 4.1 made clear, \nfacilitating institutions play a decisive role by providing financial and \ntechnical  resources  as  well  as  institutional  support  to  functional \ninstitutions. ADB\u2019s role is particularly important. Established in 1966, \nADB is now mandated to contribute actively to regional economic \ncooperation in Asia and the Pacific. In 1994, the bank adopted a \nregional cooperation policy (RCP) which, for the first time, articulated \nADB\u2019s approach to promoting regional cooperation. Since then, ADB \n73  Asian Highway Handbook, ESCAP, 2003.\n145", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nhas supported a growing list of regional and subregional cooperation \nprograms: GMS in Southeast Asia, SASEC in South Asia, CAREC in \nCentral Asia, the Subregional Economic Cooperation in South and \nCentral Asia (SECSCA), and the Pacific Plan.\nThere are three phases to ADB\u2019s support for regional cooperation. \nFirst,  ADB  is  expected  to  raise  awareness  among  its  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) on the importance of regional cooperation \nthrough information dissemination, with the overall aim of building \nmutual respect, confidence, and trust. Second, regional projects and \nprograms that could yield quick and tangible results are to be identified. \nThird, ADB is to finance cross-border and national projects with a \nsignificant cross-border or regional dimension. As well as regional \ncooperation and integration, ADB\u2019s Long-Term Strategic Framework \n(2008\u20132020) identified another four core areas of involvement for the \nADB: infrastructure, environment, finance sector development, and \neducation.\nIn 2006, ADB adopted a regional cooperation and integration (RCI) \nstrategy with four pillars:\n1. regional and subregional economic cooperation programs on \ncross-border infrastructure, physical connectivity, and related \nhardware/software;\n2. trade  and  investment  cooperation  and  integration,  and \nregulatory coordination;\n3. monetary  and  financial  cooperation  and  integration,  and \nmacroeconomic and financial stability; and\n4. cooperation  on  regional  public  goods  (clean  energy  and \nenvironmental protection, communicable disease control and \ndisaster relief, and good governance for transnational crime \nprevention).\nThese four pillars aim to help reduce poverty in DMCs through \nregional collective action that leads to greater physical connectivity, \nincreased trade and investment, enhanced financial systems and \nmacroeconomic and financial stability, and improved environmental, \nhealth, and social conditions.\nUnder the first pillar, ADB is to provide significant lending and non-\nlending operations. To implement the lending programs, ADB provides \nfinancial assistance and technical expertise to develop the required \ninfrastructure software, facilitate trade and investment, coordinate \nand harmonize sector regulations, procedures, and standards, and \nsupport a range of cross-border policy measures.\nUnder the second pillar, ADB\u2019s role in trade and investment \ncooperation  and  integration,  which  is  primarily  of  a  non-lending \n146", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nnature, includes support to regional and subregional forums (such \nas ASEAN, ASEAN+3, SAARC, CAREC, GMS, BIMSTEC, and BIMP-\nEAGA) by playing a facilitating role in regional trade and investment \npolicy dialogue; capacity and institutional development for DMCs on \nissues related to FTAs and trade facilitation; research and information \ndissemination, including support for establishing a database on FTAs \nin Asia and the Pacific; and building stronger partnerships with other \nstakeholders and institutions that support RCI in trade and investment \nin Asia and the Pacific as well as elsewhere (such as the WTO, World \nBank, Inter-American Development Bank, Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development [OECD], ESCAP, and Pacific Economic \nCooperation Council).\nUnder the third pillar, ADB is intensifying its support for regional \nmonetary  and  financial  cooperation  and  integration.  It  facilitates \nopen and dynamic consultation among all countries and stakeholders \nconcerned in order to ensure a broad-based consensus and a greater \nsense of ownership in implementing and managing initiatives related \nto monetary and financial cooperation and integration. All this is \ndone through non-lending knowledge products and includes support \nfor the regional economic policy dialogue process, for both existing \norganizations (such as ASEAN, ASEAN+3, APEC, and ASEM) and \nprospective ones (under the auspices of regional forums such as \nSAARC and CAREC); capacity building and institutional strengthening \nof  DMCs;  analysis,  research,  and  information  dissemination;  and \npartnership building with other stakeholders and/or institutions that \nsupport monetary and financial integration in Asia and the Pacific and \nelsewhere (International Monetary Fund [IMF], BIS, and the OECD).\nFor the fourth pillar, ADB\u2019s role focuses on supporting regional and \nsubregional policy dialogue and initiatives to protect the environment, \ncontrol communicable diseases (such as avian influenza, HIV/AIDS, \nand SARS), manage the impact of natural disasters, promote clean \nenergy and energy efficiency, improve governance, and prevent human \nand drug trafficking; conducting research on these cross-border issues; \nsupporting capacity building and institutional strengthening of DMCs to \nrespond to cross-border issues; and supporting regional partnership \nbuilding through various regional forums and exchange programs.\nFinally, the RCI\u2019s implementation requires adequate resources. \nADB established the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility (RCIFPF) in February 2007 to coordinate existing \nand new resources, and facilitate the provision of financial assistance \nfor RCI activities on a joint or parallel basis with development partners. \nResources  from  partners  under  this  facility  are  provided  through \n147", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nTable 4.3.

It provides grants for technical assistance, including advisory, project preparatory, and regional \nhelp. As of December 2009, 58 projects had been submitted for funding with a total requested budget of $59.5 million. Thirty-seven \nprojects were selected for funding with a total commitment of $37.5 million, or 94% of the RCIF\u2019s total fund of $40 million.\nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund (ICFF)\nThe Government of Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed an arrangement in January 2008 to establish the ICFF as \na trust fund under the RCIFPF. The total commitment at end-October 2009 was $22.9 million.

The ICFF \nfinances or cofinances on a grant basis: technical assistance to the public or private sector for the formulation of a legal and regula-\ntory framework, preparation of projects, and advisory services; and grant components of investment projects that contribute directly to \npoverty reduction. In 2008, seven projects were approved totaling $4.3 million. Another seven projects were approved for funding in \n2009, with a total cost of $7.2 million. The total cost of projects approved was $11.5 million, 50% of total commitments.\nPoverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation (PRC Fund)\nThe PRC Fund, the first such fund to be established by an ADB DMC, was established on 25 March 2005 by the People\u2019s Republic \nof China. It aims to strengthen the capacity of developing member countries to reduce poverty through regional cooperation. The \nPRC Fund seeks to advance ADB\u2019s regional cooperation initiatives to accelerate economic growth, spur private-sector development, \npromote peace and order, and provide regional public goods that address regional concerns such as communicable diseases and \nenvironmental degradation. The fund, totaling $20 million, was given in five equal installments from 2005\u20132009.

Transregional Institutions\nAsia\u2019s three main transregional IRIs, all of them overarching, are APEC, \nwhich straddles Asia and both sides of the Pacific, the Asia-Europe \nMeeting, and the narrower Eurasian Economic Community.\nAsia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC).  Established  in \n1989, APEC is an intergovernmental forum for facilitating economic \ngrowth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It \nproceeds on a voluntary, nonbinding, and consensus-oriented basis.74 \n74  The 21 member economies are Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; \nMexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; the Philippines; the Russian Federation; \nSingapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and Viet Nam. Also see Ravenhill (2002a).\n148", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nAPEC has an ambitious objective of creating a regional community. \nCommunity building has been pursued through a wide range of areas \nfor cooperation (undertaken by different committees and working \ngroups). APEC has an international secretariat, located in Singapore, \nwhich plays a coordinating role and provides technical and advisory \nsupport.\nBefore APEC\u2019s launch, economic cooperation in the wider Asia-\nPacific region was promoted through nongovernmental initiatives. \nThe first was the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC), a forum \nfor regional business leaders established in 1967 which has been \nin decline since APEC formed the APEC Business Advisory Council \n(ABAC). Another was the Pacific Trade and Development (PAFTAD) \nconference series (since 1968), a forum for policy-oriented academics \nin  the  region.  PECC  (initially  the  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \nConference,  later  the  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Council),  a \ntripartite consultative body of people from business, government, and \nacademic circles in the region, was formed in 1980. All established \ninternational secretariats, and both PBEC and PECC formed national \nchapters that helped create constituencies for regional economic \ncooperation. All three have played and continue to play overlapping \nsupporting and facilitating roles.\nSince  its  first  Economic  Leaders\u2019  Meeting  in  Seattle,  United \nStates (US), in 1993, APEC\u2019s main task has been trade and investment \nliberalization and facilitation. In Seattle, APEC leaders declared that \nthey would achieve \u201cfree and open trade and investment in Asia \nand Pacific.\u201d A year later, in Bogor, Indonesia, they set a deadline for \nachieving that goal of 2010 for APEC\u2019s developed economies and 2020 \nfor developing ones (Bogor Goals). In 1995, leaders adopted the Osaka \nAction Agenda, a strategic roadmap for implementing the Bogor Goals. \nIn Manila, Philippines, in 1996, leaders agreed that each member \neconomy should henceforth submit an annual Individual Action Plan \n(IAP) detailing their actions to meet the Bogor Goals.\nThe 1997/98 financial crisis and its economic and political fallout \ndealt  APEC  a  huge  blow.  Early  voluntary  sectoral  liberalization, \nan attempt to open up ostensibly \u201ceasy\u201d sectors, also failed. IAPs \nimplemented since 1997 have achieved much less liberalization than \nexpected. Although APEC economies have liberalized multilaterally \nby implementing on schedule their commitments under the Uruguay \nRound of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), further \nunilateral  liberalization  has  been  limited  in  coverage  and  depth.  \nWith progress on liberalization slow, APEC has shifted its attention \ntowards  issues  such  as  trade  facilitation,  capacity  building,  and  \n149", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nbehind-the-border  regulatory  reforms.  This  agenda  shift  also \nreflects changes in the business environment, notably the increased \nglobalization  of  trade  and  investment  and  the  proliferation  of \npreferential trade agreements in Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. The 2005 \nBusan Roadmap for achieving the Bogor Goals also reflected this shift \n(Yamazawa 2009).\nAPEC  responded  in  a  timely  manner  to  the  recent  global \neconomic and financial crisis. On 15 November 2008 in Washington, \nUnited States, leaders of the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and \nCentral Bank Governors (G20) agreed to take urgent action to stabilize \nfinancial markets and to coordinate their macroeconomic policies \nto restore growth and stability\u2014steps the 2008 APEC forum in Lima, \nPeru, strongly supported. The G20 looks likely to be an increasingly \nimportant forum for managing the world economy. Since nine of its \nmembers are also in APEC, they could help shape the G20 agenda if \nthey coordinated their positions. APEC could also cooperate closely \nwith the G20 in tackling other challenges such as environmental \nprotection,  disaster  management,  and  preventing  the  spread  of \ninfectious diseases prevention. However, APEC\u2019s agenda is overloaded \nand over the next decade leaders need to set it new priorities both in \nits traditional arena of trade and investment liberalization and more \nbroadly. With the US due to host APEC leaders in 2011\u2014and the US \npresident\u2019s evident support\u2014APEC can succeed in doing so.\nThe year 2010 is the deadline for meeting its mid-term Bogor Goals. \nAPEC\u2019s developed economies still maintain trade barriers in sensitive \nsectors but have made fairly good progress on trade and investment \nfacilitation (Yamazawa 2009). Its \u201cfive plus \u03b1\u201d economies are likely to \ngraduate from their Bogor Goals process and set a post-Bogor agenda \nto pursue deeper liberalization through a Trans-Pacific Partnership \n(TPP) or FTA for Asia Pacific (FTAAP).75 APEC has already adopted a \n\u201cpathfinder\u201d approach whereby economies that are ready to do so can \nproceed faster than others. Some other economies, including ASEAN \nmembers once they have completed their AEC agenda, are expected \nto join this \u201cfive plus \u03b1\u201d group. If APEC moves towards a post-Bogor \nagenda of further liberalization and tackling new cooperation issues, it \nwill help ASEAN+3 and EAS move forward too. While it is still unclear \nhow ASEAN+3 and the EAS will manage their relationships with \npartners outside their region, APEC can certainly help with countries \nacross the Pacific, notably the US. The US could also use APEC to \n75  The \u201cfive\u201d are the developed economies of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the \nUS, while the \u03b1 denotes other economies such as Chile; Hong Kong, China; and Singapore \nthat are equally qualified.\n150", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nensure that American businesses are fairly treated by ASEAN+3 and \nthe EAS without actually joining those organizations.\nFinally, it is worth noting that despite APEC\u2019s continued adherence \nto a voluntary, nonbinding system, it has embarked on a limited form \nof accountability: a peer review of the annual submission of members\u2019 \nIAPs. Arguably, this process has created a system of peer pressure to \nnudge member countries toward taking the progressive steps necessary \nfor accelerating growth. To be sure, sovereignty concerns remain, and \nthe general preference for managing sensitive issues between member \nstates at the global rather than regional level still holds.\nAsia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM).  Inspired  by  APEC,  East  Asian \ncountries have also developed overarching institutions that connect \nthem to Europe and Latin America.76 The ASEM began in 1996 in \nBangkok. The idea for an ASEM has been attributed to Goh Chok Tong, \nthe former prime minister of Singapore, who had raised it during a visit \nto Europe in 1994. It won support from Germany and the EU, which \nled to the publication of Towards a New Asia Strategy that envisioned \nstrengthening \u201cthe Union\u2019s economic presence in Asia in order to \nmaintain the Union\u2019s leading role in the world economy.\u201d77\nAn intergovernmental overarching institution, the ASEM process \ncomprises participants from East Asia and the EU.78 The Chairman\u2019s \nStatement from the first summit called for \u201ca new comprehensive Asia-\nEurope Partnership for Greater Growth\u201d, one that would \u201cstrengthen \ndialogue on an equal basis\u2026 through the sharing of perceptions on \na wide range of issues.\u201d79 ASEM summits are held every two years, \nalternately in Asia and Europe. Heads of state and/or government \nattend, as do accompanying ministers, the head of the European \nCommission  and  other  stakeholders.  Complementing  the  ASEM \nsummits are a series of ministerial and working-level meetings, as \nwell as a number of activities arising from them. ASEM activities are \ngrouped into three pillars: political, economic, and sociocultural.\nASEM leaders have identified the following as areas of shared \nconcern and prospective collaboration: strengthening multilateralism \n76  The transregional institution linking East Asia and Latin America, the Forum for East Asia\u2013\nLatin America Cooperation (FEALAC), will not be discussed here. Both informal processes \nare similar in that they share a so-called \u201csoft rules framework\u201d (Yeo 2000; Milliot 2004).\n77  European Commission (1994: 3).\n78  They are: Austria, Belgium, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, \nHungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mongolia, Myanmar, \nthe Netherlands, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, \nSlovenia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Kingdom, Viet Nam, the ASEAN Secretariat, and \nthe European Commission.\n79  ASEM (1996: 1).\n151", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nand addressing global threats of common concern; globalization, \ncompetitiveness,  and  structural  changes  in  the  global  economy; \nsustainable  development  with  a  focus  on  the  UN\u2019s  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals; climate change, the environment, and energy; \nand  intercultural  and  interfaith  dialogue.  After  the  1997/98  Asian \nfinancial  crisis,  an  ASEM  Trust  Fund  was  established  to  finance  \nsmall-scale projects for a limited period. Asia-Europe cooperation \nhas not progressed very far, however, partly because the broad (and \nvague) areas enumerated above are accompanied by few (if any) \nspecifics (Robles 2007). Even the ASEM Trust Fund is administered \nby an external institution, the IMF. Moreover, the ASEM process has \nindirectly  been  complicated  by  institutional  enlargement  in  both \nASEAN and the EU.\nAlthough ASEM\u2019s formation helped to bridge the perceived cultural \nand political differences between East Asia and Europe, the issue \nof Myanmar has been a sore point. The divide between developed \nand developing East Asia has also complicated cooperative efforts, \nas has the EU\u2019s reluctance to engage in dialogue over reform of the \ninternational financial architecture. The EU\u2019s decision to embark on \nFTA negotiations with ASEAN in October 2006 was an acknowledgment \nthat the ASEM process had failed to deliver on its aims. Indeed, ASEM \nhas achieved considerably less than APEC in terms of transregional \ntrade. From the Europeans\u2019 viewpoint, by negotiating for an FTA, they \nwere merely playing \u201ccatch-up\u201d in the wake of a spate of bilateral FTAs \nconcluded between individual ASEAN members and Japan or the \nUS.80 However, through two nonbinding ASEM frameworks, the Trade \nFacilitation Action Plan (TFAP) and the Investment Promotion Action \nPlan (IPAP), the EU has been able to urge transregional dialogue on \ntrade facilitation and investment promotion, through which their Asian \ncounterparts have been pressured to revise domestic laws and grant \nmarket access to European firms (Robles 2007).\nEurasian Economic Community (EurAsEc). EurAsEc\u2014which was \nestablished in 2000 and includes the Russian Federation and Belarus, \nplus Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan in Central Asia, \nwhile Uzbekistan has suspended its membership since late 2008\u2014aims \nto capitalize on continuing economic links among the former Soviet \nrepublics. It originates from an initiative in 1994 to form a customs \nunion  between  the  Russian  Federation,  Belarus,  and  Kazakhstan, \nwhich the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan subsequently joined. The \nCentral Asian Economic Community (CAEC) formed by Kazakhstan, \n80  On European motivations, see Geest (2004).\n152", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan in 1994, later renamed Central \nAsia Cooperation Organization (CACO), was in effect subsumed by \nEurAsEc in 2005. EurAsEc has arguably been driven largely by the \nRussian Federation\u2019s desire, and that of some Central Asian countries, \nto keep other major powers out of that region. Its members also share \nproblems that provide a strong basis for regional cooperation in areas \nsuch as trade, water, energy, and perhaps security (Pomfret 2009).\nEurAsEc has an Interstate Council consisting of heads of state  \nand/or  government  that  meets  regularly.  It  also  has  an  Inter-\nparliamentary Assembly, with a secretariat in St. Petersburg, Russian \nFederation, and a Court of Justice in Minsk, Belarus, an institutional \nfeature absent in other Asian subregions. EurAsEc also has a number \nof working groups. In 2006, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan \nestablished  the  Eurasian  Development  Bank,  which  is  formally \nindependent but works closely with EurAsEc and became an official \nobserver in 2008. In 2009, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan \ncreated a $10 billion fund to address the widening income gaps within \nEurAsEc. However, fundamental (political, geopolitical, and economic) \nproblems have prevented this regional institution from making much \nprogress in promoting regional economic integration (Pomfret 2009).\n4.7. Security Institutions\nSince the end of the Cold War, security-related institutions in Asia \nand the Pacific have grown. In a sense, most (if not all) overarching \ninstitutions in the region are security-oriented in that security concerns \nend up on their agendas at some time for a variety of reasons. APEC \nis a good example: in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, terrorism \nbecame the focus of the 2001 forum in Shanghai, PRC, notwithstanding \nits trade agenda. For our purposes, the security institutions of interest \nhere are two transregional IRIs\u2014the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and \nthe Six-Party Talks (SPT)\u2014and a regional one: the Collective Security \nTreaty Organization (CSTO).\nASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). Comprising 27 members,81 the \nARF has two stated objectives: fostering constructive dialogue and \nconsultation on political and security issues of common interest and \nconcern; and contributing to security cooperation in Asia and the \n81  ASEAN-10, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the EU, India, \nJapan, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, \nNew Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Timor-\nLeste, and the United States. \n153", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nPacific. More fundamentally, the ARF is a mechanism for ASEAN to \nkeep the US engaged in the region, while peacefully engaging a rising \nPRC, encouraging it to become a \u201cresponsible\u201d power, and maintaining \nthe centrality of ASEAN in the regional security architecture. Its origins \nlie in the ASEAN Post-ministerial Conferences (PMCs), which helped \ntransform ASEAN\u2019s relations with its dialogue partners into an informal \nmultilateral arrangement.82 With the institutionalization of the PMC \nprocess into the ARF in 1994, Asia and the Pacific finally obtained a \nsecurity institution that serves the entire region. In 1995, the ARF \nreleased its Concept Paper, which identified a three-stage approach to \nsecurity cooperation: confidence building, preventive diplomacy, and \nconflict resolution.\nSeen as little more than a talking shop, ARF has long remained \nin confidence-building mode, unable to pursue its more ambitious \ngoals.83 It is hampered by political and institutional constraints, not \nleast the size of its membership, the participation of the world\u2019s major \npowers, and the structural oddity of having ASEAN, a subregional \ngrouping of relatively weak states, acting as its fulcrum. Of late, the \nARF has opted to reformulate its strategy towards practical regional \ncooperation through concrete programs in areas such as disaster-\nrelief management, maritime security, and counterterrorism (Severino \n2010). However, the ARF has achieved little so far, perhaps because \nof  resource  constraints.  Rather,  collaboration  is  between  some \nASEAN and some non-ASEAN members of the ARF, with a fair bit of \nactivity centered on capacity building (Haacke 2009). A former ASEAN \nsecretary-general has argued for the formation of a body to execute \nARF's  decisions  on  dealing  with  non-traditional  security  threats \n(Severino 2010).\nSix Party Talks (SPT). Established in 2003, the Six-Party Talks \n(SPT)\u2014which  bring  together  the  PRC,  Japan,  the  Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Russian \nFederation, and the US\u2014is an ad hoc framework for negotiations \non the proposed denuclearization of the DPRK. Launched in August \n2003 in a bid to end the DPRK\u2019s nuclear program through multilateral \nnegotiations among its six members, the SPT has two key roles. \nFirst, it addresses region-specific proliferation dynamics. Second, it \nseeks to enhance global governance by supporting the global non-\n82  The role of non-state institutions in promoting security cooperation\u2014in particular, \nnongovernmental, Track 2 policy communities comprising representatives from academia, \nthink tanks, media, and the corporate sector (ASEAN-ISIS, CSCAP)\u2014should also be \nacknowledged.\n83  Emmers and Tan (2009); Katsumata (2006); Yuzawa (2006).\n154", "Anatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \nproliferation regime through compliance with the norms and rules \nof the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nSome view the SPT as a potential building block for a future \nsecurity institution for Northeast Asia (Smith 2010). In effect, the talks \nhave become a multilateral mechanism for dealing with the DPRK, \nshort of using force. The SPT also involves five significant regional \npowers actively engaging in preventive diplomatic activities, implicitly \nchallenging the ARF as a security institution of significance. It has also \nled the US, the PRC, and Japan to negotiate and revise their policy \npositions in ways the ARF has not been able to accomplish. At present, \nsecretariat functions for the SPT are undertaken by the PRC\u2019s Ministry \nof Foreign Affairs.\nCollective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In May 2002, \nthe Collective Security Treaty of the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates  was  renamed  the  Collective  Security  Treaty  Organization \n(CSTO), with the stated intent of preserving territorial integrity and \nseeking closer cooperation with multilateral institutions such as the \nUN, the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE), SCO, \nand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The CSTO brings \ntogether the Russian Federation, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan (which joined in 2006). \nA common air-defense architecture and the coordination of foreign, \nsecurity, and defense policies are also part of the CSTO framework. \nCounterterrorism has also been a priority. The Russian Federation \nhas, through the CSTO, committed financial and technical resources \nand also supported the OSCE\u2019s initiative to develop projects aimed \nat strengthening security along Tajikistan\u2019s border with Afghanistan. \nMuch as in the case of the EurAsEc, the Russian Federation more or \nless defines the organization\u2019s agenda. Due to a lack of political will \nand resource constraints, most CSTO members have not contributed \nin a substantive way to the organization.\n4.8. Conclusion\nAsia and the Pacific is so vast that it defies easy generalization. Its \ncomplex regional architecture\u2014a tangled web of IRIs with overlapping \nagendas and memberships\u2014reflects its diverse geography, history, \nideology, culture, and politics, as well as the influence of events and the \nexternal players. Tensions between functionally determined (interest \nand/or issue-based) arrangements and the quest for culturally defined \n155", "Institutions for Regional Integration\n(values-based) configurations have added to the complexity (Yu 2003). \nBroadly speaking, though, the region\u2019s institutions are characterized \nby an intergovernmental structure, consensus decision-making, non-\nbinding rules and commitments, low delegation, weak compliance, \nand robust sovereignty norms.\nThe evolution of Asia\u2019s IRIs has been mainly ad hoc and reactive, \nwith most having emerged in response to specific objectives and \npressing needs.84 Institutional forms and designs have evolved along \nwith  changing  patterns  of  sociocultural,  economic,  and  political \nrelationships and links. The ARF and ASEAN+3, for instance, have \nemerged from the growing ties between ASEAN and its external \ndialogue partners. The ASEAN Charter emerged from the collective \nwillingness  of  ASEAN  member  states  to  \u201cupgrade\u201d  their  regional \nassociation in response to emerging economic and political challenges \n(Severino 2009). While Asia\u2019s IRIs ought to be strengthened and the \nregional institutional architecture streamlined, ad hoc arrangements \nhave not all been ineffectual. Cementing existing achievements is thus \na crucial task.\nThe  region\u2019s  economic,  political,  and  security  architecture  is \nevolving, and regional leaders and policymakers have talked about\u2014\nand developed plans for\u2014enhancing regional cooperation. Efforts \nsuch as the Pacific Islands\u2019 Regional Institutional Framework imply \na growing determination to limit agenda and/or role duplication and \nwaste of resources. Regional leaders may need to identify which IRIs \nare the \u201cdefining\u201d institutions that can best meet the specific demands \nof a particular challenge. EAS leaders\u2019 affirmation at their 2009 summit \non ASEAN+3\u2019s role as the \u201cmain vehicle\u201d for East Asia community \nbuilding suggests that regional leaders may be making that effort.\n84  All the chapters emphasize this point; for detailed analysis, see Chand (2009) and Severino \n(2009).\n156", "V Goods IV.6IV.7IV.8 hcraeseR cifitneicS & ygolonhceTs enuosi tysamtIm

\nproliferation of regional institutions and agreements over \nthe  past  decade,  misplaced  comparisons  with  other \nregions have cast a shadow over institution building in \nAsia. Europe, in particular, is often held up as a model to \nfollow (by those who lament Asian institutions\u2019 limitations in creating \nand enforcing binding obligations), or to avoid (by those who view the \ninformality and consensus building of Asian institutions as superior to \nthe rule-driven and formal apparatus of European integration).\nYet  such  interregional  sparring  over  institutional  models  is \nexaggerated.  For  one  thing,  Asia  is  changing:  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has endorsed a more formal legal \nidentity for its core institutions; and the former prime minister of Japan, \nYukio Hatoyama, proposed an East Asian Community that explicitly \nreferences  the  European  example  of  national  reconciliation  and \ncooperation. Also, Europe is not as different from Asia as it once seemed: \nit has become clear that European governments and electorates remain \ndeeply attached to national sovereignty and institutional accountability.\nTaking a longer view and a broader sample of regions, Asia no \nlonger appears an outlier on all dimensions of regional institution \nbuilding.  As  Chapter  4  showed,  it  is  hardly  bereft  of  regional \ninstitutions\u2014and when compared to other developing regions, Asia\u2019s \ninstitutions may differ more in their design than in their effectiveness. \nMoreover, a systematic, worldwide review of institutions for regional \nintegration (IRIs) reveals no single model of regional development \nthat Asia must emulate. Comparisons with other regions are therefore \nbest used to explain Asia\u2019s institutional trajectory to date and evaluate \n162", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \nfeasible future options, rather than to assert an optimal model of \nregional development.\nIn this chapter, comparisons are organized by the clusters of \nvariables, described in Chapter 3, that have influenced the dynamics \nand design of regional institutions in Asia and elsewhere: the underlying \ncharacteristics that may affect regional preferences for cooperation \n(Section  5.1);  the  dynamics  of  institution  building  (Section  5.2); \ninstitutional design and its effects (Section 5.3); and, finally, explanations \nfor institutional effectiveness (Section 5.4). The chapter concludes \nby using the findings from comparative analysis to present plausible \ninstitutional futures for Asian regionalism (Section 5.5).\n5.1. Regional Characteristics\nThree main characteristics of a region shape its institution building: the \ndegree of homogeneity of national policy preferences; the distribution \nof economic and military power; and its openness, notably to the \ninfluence of external actors. Asia (and other regions) must take these \ninto account in seeking to design effective institutions.\nPreferences for Economic Cooperation\nThe  degree  of  homogeneity  of  national  preferences  for  regional \ncooperation and institution building tends to depend on three further \ncharacteristics: the extent of regional economic integration, the degree \nof disparities in income levels, and the similarity of political regimes.\nAs documented in Chapter 2, Asia\u2019s economies are almost as \nintegrated as Europe\u2019s and North America\u2019s. In other regions, such \nincreasing integration has led both governments and private actors, \nparticularly businesses, to demand regional action to consolidate \nand deepen integration. Yet, compared to other regions, firms and \nother social actors in Asia have been relatively passive; governments \nhave been the main drivers of regional institution building. Regional \nfirms have seldom lobbied actively for\u2014or even made use of\u2014the \npreferential trade agreements that have proliferated over the past \ndecade  (Ravenhill  2009).  Entities  that  represent  business  within \nregional institutions\u2014such as the ASEAN Business Advisory Council, \nthe  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  Business  Advisory \nCouncil, and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\u2014behave as \nformal consultative bodies rather than advocacy groups championing \nbusiness interests.\n163", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nNesadurai\u2019s (2009) investigation of labor organizations and other \ncivil society groups reveals a similar pattern: they are not decisive (or \neven prominent) players in the development of regional economic \ninstitutions in Asia. Groups affiliated with regional organizations\u2014\nsuch  as  the  ASEAN  Trade  Union  Council,  the  ASEAN  People\u2019s \nAssembly, and the Solidarity for Asian People\u2019s Advocacy\u2014have been \nmore active, but have scarcely been a driving force for regional and \nsubregional institutions. In contrast to several other regions, regional \ninstitution building in Asia has so far been a top\u2013down process led \nby governments. Behind them, by and large, have been domestic \npolitical and economic coalitions that support integration into the \ninternational economy and efforts to enhance regional cooperation \n(Solingen 2009).\nWhile Asia\u2019s economic integration may suggest a convergence of \nnational preferences for regional cooperation, other measures point \ntoward a greater heterogeneity. Asia displays a wider divide between \nits richest and poorest members than Europe or the Americas. Asia\u2019s \npolitical systems are also more diverse than those of most other regions, \nwhich tend to be either predominantly democratic (the Americas and \nEurope) or authoritarian (the Middle East and North Africa). Public \nspending levels also vary more across Asia than Europe (if not other \nregions), reflecting a split between countries with social-democratic \npreferences for a larger state sector and more market-oriented ones \nwith smaller governments (Hix 2009).\nOther measures of preference convergence produce a more mixed \npicture. Survey data suggest that individual Asian citizens\u2019 values\u2014\nparticularly attitudes toward wealth accumulation and protecting the \nenvironment\u2014vary roughly as much as across the 27 members of \nthe European Union (EU) (Hix 2009). Surprisingly, identification with \nthe region was also similarly strong. Despite this evidence of popular \npreferences, \u201coverall, the level of political, economic and ideological \nconvergence is lower in East Asia than in Europe\u201d (Hix 2009). All this \nevidence that preferences across Asia vary more points to the value of \nsubregional institutions or functional ones within the region that would \ngroup economies with similar preferences.\nDistribution of Economic and Military Power\nThe  skewed  distribution  of  the  size  of  Asia\u2019s  populations  and \neconomies, a reasonable first approximation of national power, is \nunlike that of Europe and other regions. As described in Chapter 3, \n164", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \nhowever, the effects of power distribution on the building of regional \ninstitutions are contested. Regions with relatively lower (Europe) and \nhigher (North America) degrees of military and economic asymmetry \nhave constructed successful institutions for integration (albeit much \nmore developed in Europe\u2019s case than in North America). Both the \ndynamic of power relations (the speed of shifts in economic and \nmilitary  power)  and  the  persistence  of  regional  rivalries  among \ndominant powers may be more significant than a simple measure of \npower distribution.\nStrategic  competition  has  certainly  shaped  the  evolution  of \nregional institutions in Asia. Ravenhill (2009) finds that the recent surge \nin preferential trading arrangements involving Asian economies\u2014like \nthe wider and longer-running effort to build subregional and pan-\nregional economic cooperation frameworks\u2014has been \u201cdriven by \npolitics rather than economics.\u201d Notably, \u201cIn East Asia, the political \ndomino effect has been shaped by rivalry between PRC and Japan \nfor  regional  leadership.\u201d  This  political  domino  effect,  like  the \neconomically driven version described by Baldwin (2009), may have \nliberalizing consequences. But contested leadership and rivalry may \nalso set limits on both liberalization and regional cooperation, since \ndeeper economic integration may require sturdier institutions with \ngreater delegated authority, a development which requires a degree of \nconsensus among the major participating powers.\nOpen Regionalism and the Influence of  \nOutside Actors\nHistory illustrates the effects\u2014both positive and negative\u2014that outside \nintervention  may  have  on  regional  collaboration  and  institutional \noutcomes. Perhaps the most significant example is the support lent \nby the United States (US) to the building of the European Economic \nCommunity (EEC) during the Cold War. Especially in the decade after \n1945, when Europe was dependent on the US economically as well \nas for its security, the US clearly endorsed common European policies \nand new regional institutions. For political and military reasons, the US \npreferred an integrated Europe with coherent policies.\nWhile outside powers generally no longer exert as much as \ninfluence as the Cold War superpowers did, some regions are more \nsusceptible  to  external  influence  than  others.  In  Africa,  external \nagencies and governments have provided key support for nascent \nregional institutions, but have also pressed agendas that were not \n165", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nshared by regional governments and sponsored competing subregional \norganizations.85 In Latin America, the US has promoted democracy \nerratically, but has had relatively little influence on regional economic \ninstitutions.\nAsia remains dependent on the US and the EU for export markets, \nalthough that dependence is likely to decline over time. Four Asian states \nalso have military alliances with the US; several others have informal \ndefense relationships with it. Outside parties will therefore have a deep \ninterest in the choices made in building regional institutions\u2014and \nsubstantial leverage to influence them. Of course, misplaced efforts to \nuse that leverage could also spur defensive regionalism in Asia.\nComparative  evidence  indicates  that  these  underlying  regional \ncharacteristics\u2014preference  heterogeneity,  power  asymmetries,  and \nopenness to outside influence\u2014may not produce uniformly strong or \npredictable effects on regional collaboration. Their influence is unlikely to \ndiminish in the near term, however. In order to be effective, then, regional \ninstitutions must be designed to offset any negative effects. Smaller \nregional groupings can combine countries with convergent preferences \n(at least at the outset); diplomatic efforts can be made to dampen \nregional rivalries; and transparency in negotiating and implementing \nregional agreements may alleviate the concerns of outside powers \ncapable of undermining regional projects.

Dynamics of Institution Building\nEach major region has experienced a different dynamic of regional \ndevelopment. The evolving links between security conditions and \neconomic integration have affected the success of regional institutions. \nFeedback effects from economic integration have strengthened the \ndemand for regional institutions in some cases and led to alternative \ninstitutional responses in others. The importance of the regional option \nitself, compared to global and subregional institutions, has varied over \ntime both within and between regions. Contingencies, including the \nemergence of regional political entrepreneurs and exogenous shocks \nfrom military threats and economic crises, have had demonstrable \n(but unpredictable) effects on the building of regional institutions.\n85  See Khadiagala (2009) on the role of outside actors in the Economic Community of Central \nAfrican States and competition between the West African Economic and Monetary Union, \nsponsored by France, and the Economic Community of West African States, led by Nigeria.\n166", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \nBox 5.1.

Initial security conditions in Europe favored regional \ninstitutions with substantial delegated authority.

In the contemporary EU, foreign \npolicy and defense issues are part of the institutional agenda. Since \nthe failure of the EDC, however, forging a collective foreign and \nsecurity policy beyond the realm of commercial policy has lagged \nbehind the development of other common policies (Hix 2005, 2009). \nRecent institutional changes, particularly the appointment of a high \nrepresentative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy and the \nplanned European External Action Service, aim to bolster the EU\u2019s \ncommon foreign and security policy. Regional security is also covered \nby a wider network of regional institutions, such as the Council of \nEurope and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, \nwhich complement and coordinate with the EU (Kelley 2009).\nIn the Americas, peacebuilding and economic integration have \nadvanced in parallel in a mutually reinforcing relationship. The most \nsuccessful  regional  institutions,  particularly  the  Mercado  Com\u00fan \ndel Sur (Mercosur) and the North American Free Trade Agreement \n(NAFTA), were preceded by the resolution of longstanding security \nissues among the key parties (Dominguez 2009). At the same time, \nregional institutions have maintained a clear separation between rules \nand forums governing conflict within and between states and those \ndealing with regional economic integration. Consider the division \nof  responsibilities  between  the  Organization  of  American  States \n(OAS) and Mercosur. The OAS has had a longstanding role in dispute \nmediation and settlement. It later became the principal exponent \nand enforcer of democratic constitutionalism; its new role included \nregional intervention in the domestic affairs of its members. It played no \nrole, however, in regional or subregional agreements to liberalize trade \nand investment. Until Mercosur limited membership to democracies \nthrough a treaty amendment in 1997, economic integration treaties did \nnot include any clauses reflecting on the domestic political ordering or \nforeign policy behavior of their members (Dominguez 2007).

Political \nconflict and militarized disputes are seldom allowed to inhibit mutual \neconomic  interests  in  expanding  trade  and  investment.  Regional \ngovernments avoid sanctions and other economic measures that seek \nto change a target state\u2019s policies. Regional economic institutions \nreflect this separation, with few links between institutions that deal \nwith economic issues and those, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum \n(ARF), that address security concerns. Particularly in Northeast Asia, \nthis separation has permitted the growth of trade, investment, and \neconomic cooperation even in the presence of persistent territorial \nand political disputes.\nDespite these benefits of a two-track approach to economics and \nsecurity, the Asian pattern has not promoted the political reconciliation \nor military confidence building that either preceded or accompanied \nregional initiatives in Europe and Latin America. In Southeast Asia, \nASEAN may represent a partial exception to the prevailing Asian \npattern: it involves a code of state conduct (ASEAN\u2019s Treaty of Amity \nand  Cooperation)  and  norms  of  cooperative  behavior  that  have \npreceded the building of institutions of regional economic cooperation \n(the ASEAN Free Trade Area\u2014AFTA).\nExperience  elsewhere  suggests  that  Asia  might  benefit  from \nmodifying its prevailing two-track approach to economics and security. \nThe careful separation of economic cooperation from the troubled \nrealm of political and military conflict has served the region well \nduring its decades of enterprise-driven economic integration. Moving \nto a more ambitious agenda of deeper integration may require a closer \nlinkage between economics and security, on either the networked and \nintegrated European model or the Latin American pattern of sequential \nor  parallel  movement  toward  economic  integration  and  conflict \nresolution.

Successive waves of regional liberalization have \nbolstered the strength of export interests as well as their demands \nfor further liberalization, while regional institutions themselves have \nalso adopted strategies to reinforce their own role. Economic and \ninstitutional feedback effects created political support for widening \nthe liberalization agenda in the EEC and tipped European governments \nagainst the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The greater \neconomic weight of the EEC exerted a magnetic pull for trading \ninterests  outside  the  community.  The  same  mechanisms,  which \nwere dependent on a benign international trade environment, have \noperated outside Europe. In other regions, however, the outcomes \ndid not uniformly strengthen regional institutions. Latin American \nregional institutions were often born after an initial unilateral round \nof liberalization by national governments. In certain cases, such as \nthe Central America Free Trade Agreement and Mercosur, unilateral \nliberalization served as a costly signal of intent for trading partners as \nwell as reflecting exporters\u2019 growing political power.\nIn Asia, the feedback between trade expansion and regional \ninstitution building has been even more tenuous.

Other regions are more reliant \non regional institutions (Europe); more wary of global institutions \n(Latin America\u2019s unhappy history with the International Monetary  \nFund [IMF]); or remain suspicious of membership in any regional \nor global institutions with substantial authority (the Middle East\u2019s \nreluctance to embrace either the WTO or effective regional institutions).\nAsia has distanced itself from global economic institutions over \nthe  past  decade,  however.  Disenchantment  with  global  financial \ninstitutions during the 1997/98 financial crisis gave impetus to the CMI; \nthe stalemate of the WTO\u2019s Doha Round may also lend support for \ndeepening regional trade institutions. Even so, given the openness of \nthe Asian regional economy, the global option will remain attractive, \nparticularly for the largest economies (Japan, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, India). These global affiliations and attractions indicate that \nregional institutions in Asia should attempt to complement, rather than \nduplicate, the functions of global ones.\nGiven  its  investment  in  the  global  trade  regime,  Asia  has  a \ngreater interest than most other regions in ensuring that regional \nrules and institutions are consistent with global ones. One means of \nensuring such consistency lies in the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade (GATT) Article XXIV and the General Agreement on Trade \nin Services Article V, which permit regional trade agreements under \ncertain conditions, even though they violate the core GATT/WTO \nprinciple  of  nondiscrimination  (most-favored-nation  treatment  for \nmembers). The WTO\u2019s weak oversight of these agreements (through \nthe Committee on Regional Trade Agreements) and their proliferation \nover the past two decades led to their inclusion in the current Doha \nRound of trade negotiations.\nWith global trade negotiations stalled, the challenge of interpreting \nand enforcing the global rules that govern regional free trade areas \nremains. The task of ensuring their consistency with global rules may \nfall in part to regional institutions. Given the importance to Asia of a \nrobust global trade regime, existing and emerging Asian regional \ninstitutions  could  lead  the  way.  A  region-wide  institution  could \nassume this role, ensuring complementarity without precluding Asian \neconomic agreements that wish to implement a \u201cWTO-plus\u201d agenda.\nThe issue of complementarity with a central global institution, \nthe IMF, also arises with regional monetary and financial cooperation. \nRegional and plurilateral financial facilities have been a longstanding \nfeature of international monetary and financial relations, beginning \n175", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nwith the European Payments Union (if not before). However, global \nrules to govern regional arrangements for financial support have not \nbeen established (Henning 2006).\nSince such facilities have been relatively rare and concentrated \namong advanced economies, coordination with the IMF in financial \ncrisis management has not been difficult. Nevertheless, ground rules \nfor coordination between regional financial facilities, such as the \nChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM) or an eventual Asian \nMonetary Fund, would ensure that regional financial cooperation \nreinforces rather than undermines global institutions, adding to the \nbenefits for members. In particular, a weakly institutionalized financial \nsupport facility should designate a clear line of communication and \nnegotiation with the IMF, establish adequate surveillance capacity \nbefore severing the IMF \u201clink\u201d to the use of regional funds, and, most \ndifficult politically, consult with the IMF on the content of conditionality \nand the coordination of disbursements (Henning 2006, 2009a). The \nunderstandings negotiated between the CMIM and the IMF could also \nbe generalized to similar regional arrangements, filling a void in the \nglobal rules governing these institutions.\nGlobal  institutions  have  provided  one  source  of  both  useful \ncomplementarity and potential competition with regional institutions. \nSubregional organizations may also compete with one another and with \nwider regional arrangements, producing uncertain effects on regional \neconomic integration. With the exception of Asia, other regions have \na region-wide, often political, institution (or institutions) in addition to \nsubregional institutions with primarily economic functions.\nAsia\u2019s subregional institutional landscape is also unusual. Northeast \nAsia, its largest economic region, lacks any significant economic \ninstitutions; ASEAN, representing a smaller subregional economy, has \nplayed a leading role in designing region-wide initiatives (ASEAN+3, \nARF). In addition, bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements have \nproliferated in Asia over the past decade, unconstrained by region-\nwide agreement on their contents. This pattern of subregional strength \nand  region-wide  weakness  in  institutionalization  underscores  the \npossibility of competition between subregional groups and future \nregion-wide institutions.\nEvidence from other regions about the effects of subregional \norganizations on regional economic institutions is inconclusive. In \nEurope,  the  dynamic  of  trade  discrimination  combined  with  the \nEEC\u2019s economic weight to induce most members of EFTA to defect, a \ndomino effect that ultimately reduced EFTA to four small economies \nand confirmed the EEC/EU model of regional integration (O\u2019Rourke \n176", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n2009; Baldwin 2009). The EU became a regional institution with both \na political role in advancing democracy and enhancing security and a \ncentral economic role in European integration.\nRegion-wide  institutions  elsewhere  are  primarily  political; \nsubregional  organizations  have  taken  the  lead  in  economic \nintegration.  The  Organization  of  African  Unity  (OAU)  played  an \nimportant postcolonial role in confirming existing African borders \n(Herbst 2007; Khadiagala 2009). Its successor, the African Union, \nand the OAS in the Americas have mediated disputes among their \nmembers and participated in peacekeeping missions (Dominguez \n2007, 2009). The League of Arab States (LAS) had an expansive \nideological (pan-Arab), political, and economic mandate, but was \nless effective than its region-wide peers (Barnett and Solingen 2007; \nSolingen 2009).\nBecause of this implicit division of labor between subregional \neconomic  institutions  and  region-wide  political  and  security \norganizations,  little  overt  friction  resulted  between  them.  When \nbroader regional economic initiatives were undertaken, subregional \ncompetition did not seem a prominent obstacle to their successful \nnegotiation and implementation. The US-backed region-wide Free \nTrade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was defeated not by competition \nfrom  subregional  organizations,  but  by  the  US  decision  to  favor \nbilateral and plurilateral FTAs, which undermined the credibility of its \nsupport, and by opposition from regional governments, notably Brazil \nand Argentina (Dominguez 2009).\nThe Greater Arab Free Trade Area sponsored by the Arab League \nhas  enjoyed  some  success  in  reducing  tariff  barriers  among  its \nmembers; the limited nature of its economic agenda appears to owe \nlittle to the fragmented subregional landscape of economic integration \nin the Middle East (Broude 2009). Subregional competition has hindered \neconomic integration in Africa, but it is competition among subregional \norganizations with overlapping mandates and membership that has \npresented the greatest obstacle (Khadiagala 2009).\nRegion-wide institutions have diverse mandates, although nearly \nall concentrate on political or security agendas, leaving economic \nintegration to subregional groups. The major exception, the EU, began \nas a subregional organization that outcompeted its principal rival by \nattracting the overwhelming majority of members in Europe. No other \nsubregional economic grouping has won region-wide status in this \nway. As Asia contemplates its own region-wide institutions, whether \nthe East Asian Summit or a new group, it is not encumbered by a \npostcolonial organization with a fixed agenda.\n177", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nBox 5.3.

Initial conditions in \nEurope after 1945 predisposed some European governments toward a \nparticular model of regional integration\u2014one that pooled sovereignty \nand delegated substantial authority to regional institutions, rather than \nrelying on FTAs with less elaborate institutions (Baldwin 2009; O\u2019Rourke \n2009). Insecurity, an unforgiving international economic environment, \nand Europe\u2019s preference for more interventionist government policies \ntilted the pattern of European institutions in a supranational direction \n(at least within the EEC/EU).\nTwo threats to European security lingered after its two catastrophic \n\u201ccivil wars\u201d in the first half of the 20th century. The possibility of a third \nEuropean war was a pressing concern for the founders of European \ninstitutions. Embedding West Germany in European institutions was \nseen as guaranteeing a more secure future. Political reconciliation \nbetween the two arch-rivals, France and Germany, was easier within \ninstitutions with greater authority, which constrained the power of \nan economically resurgent West Germany as well as providing an \navenue  for  its  readmission  to  normal  statehood.  Franco\u2013German \nunderstanding  served  as  the  foundation  for  successive  European \nregional initiatives. Backed by the US, European institutions allowed \nEuropean  governments  to  confront  their  Cold  War  insecurities: \neconomic integration and common institutions were both a symbol \nand an instrument of a European counterweight to Soviet power.\nEurope  also  confronted  a  bleak  international  economic \nenvironment in the post-1945 years. The world economy was riddled \nwith state-imposed controls on trade, financial flows, and migration. \nIf liberalization were to occur through global negotiations, its progress \nwould likely be slow: a prediction confirmed by the US failure to ratify \nthe thereby stillborn International Trade Organization and the sluggish \npace of GATT negotiations in the 1950s. Most of the initial work on \ntrade and current account liberalization had to occur at the regional \nlevel, reinforced by nascent European economic institutions.\nA third important factor was Western Europeans\u2019 preference\u2014for \na variety of reasons, including Europe\u2019s status as the first industrialized \nregion\u2014for more interventionist states, and in particular for relatively \nhigh levels of social protection in areas such as agriculture and labor \nrelations. Europe\u2019s mixed-economy model demanded more elaborate \nregional institutions to secure these domestic bargains and ensure \nthat they would not be undermined by regional economic integration \n179", "Institutions for Regional Integration\n(O\u2019Rourke 2009). From the start, European institutions were designed \nnot solely to further economic liberalization; they also served as a \nsafeguard for domestic policies and programs that buffered European \nsocieties and interest groups against economic volatility.\nAlthough  Europe\u2019s  combination  of  initial  conditions  appears \nunique, economic crisis has also served to stimulate regional institution \nbuilding elsewhere. Latin America\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d in the 1980s was the \nseedbed for both new and redesigned regional integration initiatives. \nThe 1997/98 financial crisis spurred Asia to reconsider its relationship \nto global institutions and the performance of its regional institutions \nduring the crisis.\nInsecurity  and  international  economic  shocks  may  promote \nregional  institutions  through  at  least  two  mechanisms.  If  global \ninstitutions and the world economy appear unresponsive or unlikely to \nsupport sustained economic growth, regional institutions may emerge \nas  an  appealing  alternative  for  governments  intent  on  economic \nliberalization. External threats may also provide a necessary short-term \npolitical justification\u2014such as peace\u2014for both regional economic \nintegration and vesting substantial authority in regional institutions \n(Wyplosz 2006).\nContemporary Asia and other regions of the developing world share \nfew of these initial conditions for a leap to regional institutions with \nsubstantial supranational authority. Regional and global environments \nare unlikely to promote a rapid turn toward institutions as elaborate as \nthose of the EEC/EU. Despite the persistence of militarized interstate \ndisputes in Asia, its levels of insecurity have not approached those \nof  post-1945  Europe  for  decades.  Occasional  shocks,  including \nones as wrenching as the 1997/98 crisis, have not upended Asia\u2019s \nsuccessful economic integration, which is rooted in enterprising firms, \nunilateral liberalization by national governments, and an international \neconomy open to Asian exports after successive rounds of global \ntrade negotiations. Asian regional institutions have not, as a result, \nbeen needed to oversee and enforce the initial stages of economic \nopening. As Asian societies industrialize, however, domestic demands \nfor environmental, consumer, and labor-market regulation may create \nnew mandates for regional institutions to maintain a level playing field \nfor international competition. In this respect, Asia\u2019s status as a newly \nindustrialized region could foster the same institutional response that \nEurope, the first industrialized region, displayed in the initial stages of \nits regional integration.\n180", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n5.3. Designing Effective Institutions\nRegional comparisons confirm the importance of institutional design: \ninstitutions themselves can promote further integration and additional \ninstitution building. In rare cases, such as Europe, regional institutions \nare designed to provide institutional feedback that spurs their further \ndevelopment (Baldwin 2009). In a much more modest way, Asia has \nrelied on ad hoc entities, such as eminent persons\u2019 groups or the East \nAsia Vision Group, to offer alternative institutional futures.\nFeedback from existing institutions is not always positive: once in \nplace, institutions may impede new institutional initiatives or constrain \ntheir design. Little authority was delegated to regional institutions \nat NAFTA\u2019s foundation, and they have not been strengthened since. \nSlight evidence of positive institutional feedback can been discerned \nin  Latin  America  (Mercosur,  Central  American  Common  Market \n[CACM]). The mere presence of regional institutions may not produce a  \nself-sustaining deepening of institutionalized collaboration. Institutions \nmust be designed to further integration and its dynamics, which may \nin turn promote demand for additional institutionalization.\nRegional institutions\u2019 potential scope is set, at least initially, by a \nregion\u2019s characteristics and the dynamics of regional integration.

Asian  regional \ninstitutions display a unique combination of these mechanisms (or their \nabsence): high-level summits have played a central role in most regional \ninstitutions; legalization has been relatively low in all of its aspects; and \nprivate, nonstate actors have not been enfranchised to any significant \ndegree.  This  combination  has  failed  to  produce  a  self-sustaining \ndynamic for further institutionalization, alone or in combination with \nother dynamics based on growing trade and investment flows.\nPolitical Engagement\nAround the world, high-level political engagement has been essential \nfor  the  successful  launch  of  regional  institutions.  The  Americas \nhighlight the benefits\u2014and costs\u2014of such involvement. Support from \ntop political leaders was critical to the foundation of both Mercosur  \nand NAFTA; early initiatives in Latin America that relied on technocratic \nexpertise alone, such as the Latin American Free Trade Association, \nfailed (Dominguez 2009). Where high-level political involvement was \nnot constrained by effective regional institutions, however, it posed \nrisks for further regional institutionalization. Mercosur developed an \ninformal system of \u201cinter-presidentialism\u201d that was not governed by \ninstitutional rules. National presidents played a persistent and central \nrole in decision-making and dispute settlement. This system provided \n\u201cample space for political whim, unilateral action and non-observance \nof agreed-upon policy commitments\u201d (Phillips, cited in Dominguez \n2009). In other words, inter-presidentialism provided a large, politically \ndetermined escape clause from Mercosur commitments at critical \nmoments.\nThe EU pattern of political involvement is strikingly different from \nthat of the Americas. Political leadership has been essential to the \nlaunch of most initiatives that deepened economic integration and \nenhanced the authority of European institutions. During the 1980s \nand 1990s, bargains struck and commitments made among national \nleaders sealed the Single European Act and Economic and Monetary \nUnion.

As delegation to European institutions \nhas increased, the negative effects of high-level political intervention \nhave diminished. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s \u201cempty chair\u201d policy in the 1960s \nwas far more disruptive than Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Euro-skepticism \ntwo decades later (in part because France is a core member of the \nEEC/EU, while the United Kingdom joined later and has remained less \ncommitted to European integration). In contrast to Latin America and \nother regions, European institutions are intergovernmental, engaging \nsubstantial segments of national bureaucracies in the processes of \nintegration. National parliaments have also helped reinforce regional \ncommitments (Martin 2000).\nThe  experience  of  Europe  and  other  regions  suggests  that \nsummitry  is  not  enough  to  create  effective  regional  institutions; \ncontinuing political intervention in the absence of sturdy institutions \nmay undermine integration. High-level political commitments are an \nessential foundation for regional institution building; the engagement \nof  other  national  political  institutions\u2014such  as  legislatures  and \nbureaucracies\u2014reinforces those commitments by making them fully \nintergovernmental.\nLegalization: Obligation, Precision, and Delegation\nOn  the  three  standard  measures  of  legalization\u2014precise  and \nbinding obligations, and the delegation of authority to third parties \n(including regional institutions)\u2014EU institutions are uniformly and \nhighly legalized; regional institutions in the Americas (at least the \nsuccessful ones) are legalized on two or more of these dimensions; \nand regional institutions in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, with \nthe exception of AFTA, are not highly legalized. Asia has displayed a \nunique attachment to intergovernmental cooperation and an aversion \nto delegating authority to regional institutions. Even Latin America\u2019s \n\u201cparchment institutions\u201d\u2014elaborate on paper, but often ineffective\u2014\nare rare in Asia.\nIn the Americas and other regions, regional institutions often lack \neffective delegated authority. Latin America has several subregional \nagreements  that  have  produced  elaborate  institutional  structures, \namong  them  the  CACM,  Mercosur,  and  the  Andean  Community. \n185", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nToo often, however, parties to those agreements have failed to ratify and \nimplement the institutional arrangements (Dominguez 2009). Even when \nimplemented, regional institutions can be ignored. For example, while \nsome regional courts have substantial delegated authority, they have \nrarely been used in disputes between member states in Latin America \nor elsewhere (Voeten 2009). Mercosur\u2019s dispute settlement institutions \nhave seldom been deployed; instead, as in Asia, member states have \ntypically taken trade disputes with their regional partners to the WTO.\nThe Americas also demonstrate the ways in which one or more \ndimensions  of  legalization  can  substitute  for  others.  Rather  than \nelaborate regional institutions with supranational authority, the other \ndimensions of legalization\u2014the precision of commitments and their \nlegally binding character\u2014have been more important to the success \nof regional economic integration in the Americas.\nPrecise and binding obligations in regional economic agreements \nhave  been  effective  in  the  Americas\u2014and  their  \u201cratchet  effect\u201d \nhas been particularly significant: they have locked in liberalization \ncommitments and prevented backsliding by national governments. \nDespite an absence of delegation to regional institutions, NAFTA\u2019s \ncommitments have, by and large, been met by member states (Abbott \n2001). Likewise, Mercosur\u2019s Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n succeeded because of a \nkey innovation: a tariff phase-out program based on carefully designed \nand detailed liberalization schedules that were \u201ceasily calculable and \ntransparent\u201d (Dominguez 2009). If initial negotiations for a regional \nagreement achieve relatively complete contracts and limit escape \nclauses, it is more likely to produce substantial liberalization. A close \nparallel occurred in the early years of the EEC: the Dutch government \ninsisted on \u201clocking in\u201d the trade liberalization timetable, achieving \nprecision in both the obligations undertaken and their implementation \n(O\u2019Rourke 2009).\nThe  world  is  littered  with  elaborate  regional  institutions  that \npossess authority on paper but not in practice. In many cases, either \nmember governments have not activated that authority or national \npoliticians have overridden it at critical moments. Outside Europe, \nlegalization has mainly had an impact through the precise and binding \nnature of commitments to regional partners, rather than through \nregional institutions with substantial delegated authority.\nEnfranchising Nongovernmental Actors\nRegional  institutions  have  adopted  a  variety  of  rules  governing \nenfranchisement\u2014that is, defining the actors that can participate in \n186", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \nthem. EU institutions are unusual in offering multiple channels for \ncitizens and corporations to influence regional institutions directly, with \nelections to the European Parliament as well as access to the European \nCourt of Justice (ECJ) and the European Court of Human Rights. The \npower of private actors has been magnified by the direct effect and \nsupremacy of European law and the willingness of national courts to \nrefer cases to the ECJ for interpretation. Even though opponents of \nintegration can also use the judicial system and the ECJ, European law \nbecame a valuable asset for the \u201ccompliance constituencies\u201d within \nnational political debates (Kahler 2001a; Dai 2007). In a more limited \nfashion, NAFTA and the Andean Community also provide for nonstate \nactors to access regional dispute settlement mechanisms and courts. \nIn Asia and the Middle East, a uniformly intergovernmental model \nof regionalism allows no direct enfranchisement of nonstate actors. \nCommitment mechanisms in these regional institutions are based \nwholly on governments, without direct support from constituencies \nwithin member societies.\nMembership Rules\nOf  the  two  models  of  membership,  clubs  and  convoys,  Asia  is \nunusual in adopting only convoy membership practices\u2014inclusive \ninstitutions open to a large membership with few hurdles before \nentry\u2014in contrast to the club model represented by the EU, in which \ndemanding and intrusive changes in member states\u2019 policies are \nrequired before accession. European institutions\u2019 success in furthering \neconomic integration was in part due to their initial membership of \nlarge economies (notably France and Germany) at the core of Europe. \nThese influential early members wished to move regional cooperation \nforward (Wyplosz 2006). The domino effect and the openness of its \nmembership to those that accepted existing EEC policies were critical \nto the EEC\u2019s success in its competition with EFTA. The benefits of \nmembership, even on these demanding terms, clearly outweighed the \npolitical costs of accession. As integration proceeded and membership \nrequirements  accumulated,  however,  Europe  has  been  forced  to \naccept some \u00e0 la carte integration with the Schengen Agreement \non the free movement of people and the adoption of the common \nregional currency, the euro.\nIn other regions, restrictive membership criteria apply, although \nnone is as demanding as the EU\u2019s acquis communautaire (the body \nof existing EU rules that prospective members must accept). In Latin \nAmerica, for example, the membership criterion of democracy was \n187", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nseldom enforced during the early years of the OAS. With the adoption \nof the Santiago Commitment to Democracy in 1991, however, this \ncriterion hardened, and it began to affect collective action during the \n1990s. In addition, the democracy standard diffused to subregional \norganizations  and  initiatives,  such  as  Mercosur  (1997)  and  the \nproposed  FTAA.  In  this  case,  a  longstanding  membership  norm \nbecame operational and effective as political circumstances changed.\nAs the Latin American example indicates, when an organization \n(or region) has adopted inclusive membership practices (the convoy \nmodel),  shifting  to  more  restrictive  membership  rules  (the  club \nmodel) is difficult but not impossible. Doing so enables members \nthat are \u201ccooperators\u201d on particular issues to move forward, even \nwhen preference outliers are reluctant to participate. The creation of \ndifferent membership categories can ease this transition. Mechanisms \nthat allow a shift in membership models include creating selective \nmembership incentives (through, or in addition to, the benefits of \nintegration) that are only available to \u201ccooperators;\u201d allowing for multi-\nspeed membership; creating a \u201cvariable geometry\u201d within a single \norganization; and designing layers of multiple and complementary \ninstitutions (Kelley 2009; Pevehouse 2009). These membership changes \ncreate additional instruments that can be deployed by members (or a \ngroup of members) to shift others\u2019 behavior and move the regional \ninstitution and its policies in a pro-integration direction.\nAs Asia contemplates a new regional architecture, the scale of \nthe region, its heterogeneity, and the complexity of its economic ties \nsuggest that skillfully designed membership rules will be essential \nif regional institutions are to be effective. Achieving the right mix of \n\u201ccooperators,\u201d organized in club-like arrangements, and wider, more \ninclusive convoys for those less integrated or less committed to policy \nchange will be a major challenge in the next phase of designing a \nregional architecture.\n5.4. Institutional Effectiveness\nGauging the effectiveness of such a diverse array of regional institutions \nis a daunting task, and one with tentative results at best. As outlined in \nChapter 3, measuring such effects requires confidence in evaluating \na counterfactual: the trajectory of national policies in the absence of \nregional institutions. The task is complicated further by the unevenness \nof institutional effects: success in some domains will not be matched \nin others. For example, Europe\u2019s liberalization of trade in services has \n188", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \nlagged, despite the creation of a single market; and the effectiveness of \nits regional policies and the global effects of its Common Agricultural \nPolicy remain controversial (Wyplosz 2006).\nGiven the relatively small sample of regional institutions devoted to \npromoting economic integration (at least according to their mandates), \nany  estimate  of  their  effectiveness  will  be  imperfect.  Associating \nparticular institutional features with effectiveness will be even more \ntentative. Many regions display wide gaps between the signing and the \nratification of regional agreements, as well as significant shortfalls in \nimplementation after ratification (Dominguez 2007).\nRegional institutions typically follow rather than produce the initial \nwave of economic liberalization and trade expansion. In other words, \nan initial move of unilateral (or reciprocal) liberalization produces \nopportunities that private actors can exploit, as well as demands for \nconsolidating and extending those gains. As the Asian experience \ndemonstrates, this model of trade expansion can persist for some time \nwithout the creation of robust regional institutions.\nAfter their creation, the experience of Europe and the Americas \nsuggests that effective regional institutions can have two significant \neffects. First, they can lock in gains from both earlier liberalization and \nnegotiated commitments, and prevent backsliding when economic \nor political conditions worsen: the ratchet effect. In the course of \nEuropean institution building, successive rounds of pooling sovereignty \nand  delegating  authority  to  regional  institutions  increased  the \ncredibility of national commitments to future integration (Moravcsik \n1998).  Mercosur\u2019s  relatively  weak  institutions  helped  prevent  an \noverturning of liberalized trade among its members, even during \nsuccessive economic crises in the late 1990s and 2000s. NAFTA helped \nto consolidate economic liberalization in Mexico during and after the \npeso crisis of 1994/95. Regional institutions in the Americas have been \nless effective, however, when they have attempted to promote an \neconomic agenda beyond trade liberalization (Dominguez 2009).\nRegional institutions have also shifted national policies toward \nones that promote regional integration. NAFTA imposed important \nadjustments  on  Mexico\u2019s  legal  and  administrative  systems  and \ncontributed to its democratization. European institutions, particularly \nthe EU\u2019s membership conditionality, speeded the transformation and \nconsolidation of domestic political and economic institutions in Eastern \nEurope after 1989 (Kelley 2004, 2009). In assessing the influence of \nregional institutions on corruption, Pevehouse (2009) reiterates the \nimportance of membership incentives, noting that a combination of \ntransferring best practices and offering selective incentives through a \n189", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nclub model of membership is likely to be most effective in changing \nnational policies.\nFor contemporary Asia, perhaps the most important link between \ninstitutional design and effectiveness concerns the agenda of deeper \nintegration\u2014dealing with barriers to exchange that lie behind national \nborders and are often deeply embedded in domestic politics and \npolicy. In all regions apart from Europe, unilateral national decisions to \nreduce trade barriers or commitments undertaken at GATT/WTO have \nbeen more important than regional institutions in expanding regional \ntrade volumes. If regions wish to move beyond the elimination of \nbarriers to exchange at the border, however, are more substantial \nregional institutions with effective delegated authority required?\nFrom the very limited array of regional institutions that have \npursued an effective deeper integration agenda, several paths to \neffectiveness  are  apparent.  European  analysts  agree  that  deeper \nintegration required greater delegation to supranational institutions, \neven though the EU\u2019s particular institutional model may not be optimal \nfor other regions (Baldwin 2009; Hix 2009; Wyplosz 2006). Without \nthe EEC\u2019s institutions, Europe might well have remained a large and \nsuccessful free trade area, despite its founders\u2019 commitment to \u201cever \ncloser union.\u201d Box 5.5 explains in greater detail how Europe balances \ndelegation with national sovereignty.\nNAFTA, with its small but heterogeneous membership, is more \nsimilar  to  regional  arrangements  in  Asia  and  other  developing \nregions.  Its  more  extensive  integration  agenda  did  include  some \ndelegation to third-party adjudicators, but its alternative to EU-style \nsupranationalism was reliance on the precision and binding character \nof  the  NAFTA  agreement.  Australia  and  New  Zealand  have  also \npursued an ambitious agenda of deeper economic integration since \n1983 through their agreements on Closer Economic Relations.88 They \nhave done so without building substantial bilateral institutions to \ngovern their deepening interdependence. Rather than being a model \nfor other economic partners, exceptional circumstances appear to \nexplain the absence of institutionalization: bilateral trade was not a \ndominant share of either partner\u2019s external commerce, reducing their \n88  Closer Economic Relations (CER) replaced an existing free trade agreement between \nAustralia and New Zealand. In its first phase, CER aimed to achieve free trade in goods \nand services. After a 1988 review, when that agenda was substantially complete, the two \npartners embarked on a deeper integration agenda, which included harmonization of \nbusiness law and regulatory practices, customs procedures, government purchasing, and \ntechnical barriers to trade. \n190", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \nBox 5.5. how Europe Balances Delegation with National Sovereignty\nEuropean  Union  (EU)  governments  have  Second, the rules governing the selection of \ndelegated specific powers to the European  the EC ensure that the preferences of the executive \nCommission (EC) and the European Court  are close to those of member governments.

The  \u201cmassive \ninstitutional superstructure\u201d of the LAS seems to have had little effect \non regional relations or economic integration in the Middle East \n(Solingen 2009).

Feasible Institutions for Asia\nA survey of IRIs indicates that Asia is less of an outlier than is often thought. \nAlthough other regions have developed more elaborate institutions, their \ninfluence in spurring the growth of intraregional trade and investment \nhas, with few exceptions, been modest. The first question for Asia \nis  whether  its  model  of  successful  regional  economic  integration, \nbased largely on unilateral liberalization and WTO commitments, has \nbeen exhausted\u2014and therefore whether new regional initiatives and \ninstitutions are needed. This report answers in the affirmative.\nRegional comparisons offer at least partial answers to an equally \nimportant question: if Asia needs new regional institutions, what \ndesign will be most effective in deepening economic integration \nand building a more durable cooperative framework? This raises a \nprior question: is further institutionalization feasible? Skeptics often \nargue that Asia is highly unlikely to build new and more substantial \nregional institutions because of its heightened attachment to national \nsovereignty. As the current array demonstrates, Asian governments are \nwary that strengthened regional institutions would intrude into their \ndomestic political space and policy autonomy. However, the claim that \nsovereignty costs are an insurmountable barrier to regional institution \nbuilding in Asia is incorrect, for three reasons.\nFirst, Asia is not unique in prizing national sovereignty: governments \nin all regions display both a strong concern for their sovereignty and a \n192", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \nreluctance to grant authority to regional institutions. Although Europe \nhas gone further than other regions in using pooled sovereignty and \ndelegated authority as a commitment device, European institutions \nare constrained by national governments through an intricate design \nthat combines institutions of representation and those with delegated \nauthority (Hix 2009). In other regions, postcolonial sensitivities about \nsovereignty have hampered regional institutions from their inception. In \nLatin America, the OAS founding principles included the protection of \nnational sovereignty and maintenance of existing (previously colonial) \nborders (Dominguez 2007). Relatively weak regimes in Africa and the \nMiddle East used the OAU and LAS for the same purpose (Herbst 2007; \nBarnett and Solingen 2007).\nSecond, nearly every generalization regarding Asia, sovereignty, \nand international institutions is refuted by Asian participation in global \ninstitutions: Japan\u2019s support for a strengthened dispute settlement \nmechanism at the WTO; the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s negotiation \nof a WTO protocol of accession that imposed stringent requirements \nto change domestic regulations and laws; and the willingness of \nASEAN member states to turn to the International Court of Justice \nfor the resolution of territorial disputes (while ignoring ASEAN\u2019s own \ndispute settlement mechanism). Asia\u2019s participation record in global \ninstitutions scarcely suggests that Asian governments are unwilling to \ncompromise their sovereignty to achieve wider objectives.\nThird, for smaller (and even larger) open economies that are \nintegrated into regional and global economies, sovereignty\u2014defined \nas  effective  control  over  national  policies\u2014has  already  declined \nsharply. Smaller European economies (and even some larger ones) \nhave  calculated  that  having  a  voice  in  regional  institutions  will \noften restore sovereignty rather than impair it. Many smaller Asian \nstates may also make this calculation\u2014trading diminished national \npolicy autonomy for stronger regional institutions over which their \ngovernments exercise at least some control.\nEven  so,  concerns  over  sovereignty  cannot  be  set  aside  in \ndesigning regional institutions for Asia; they will necessarily shape any \nfeasible institutions. The record of institutional design in other regions \noffers the following guides for institutional innovation in Asia.\n\u2022  So long as a relatively open international environment and \nheterogeneous national preferences persist, a European-style \nleap to regional institutions with substantial delegated authority \nis unlikely: change will be incremental. (A protectionist backlash \nin the US and Europe might prompt a defensive regionalism in \nAsia, however.)\n193", "Institutions for Regional Integration\n\u2022  Two  conditions  that  moved  Europe  beyond  free  trade \nagreements  may  support  the  strengthening  of  regional \ninstitutions in Asia. The first is the advance of industrialization, \nwhich created demand in Europe for regional action to protect \ndomestic policy interventions, notably social protection. The \nsecond is the demand to reduce behind-the-border barriers to \neconomic exchange in order to create a single market.\n\u2022  The process of creating new institutions should be transparent, \ngiven  the  openness  of  Asia\u2019s  regional  economy  and  its \nimportance to the global economy.\n\u2022  Scale, divergent preferences, and dependence on the global \neconomy lend support to a two-tiered or multilayered approach \nto regional architecture. A pan-Asian or region-wide institution \ncould link nonmember states to institutional development, \nwhile subregional or functional clusters of \u201ccooperators\u201d with \nmore closely aligned preferences over policy and institutions \ncould  move  forward  more  quickly.  A  dominant  regional \norganization, such as the EU, is unlikely to emerge given Asia\u2019s \nregional characteristics and the global environment.\n\u2022  A  large-membership  regional  institution  that  combines \neconomic, foreign policy, and security agendas would also \npermit programs of political reconciliation and possibly military \nconfidence building that have been instrumental in furthering \nregional economic cooperation elsewhere.\n\u2022  The significance of both global and subregional rules and \ninstitutions for the Asian regional economy points to another \nrole for a peak Asian regional organization: monitoring the \ncompatibility of subregional and bilateral arrangements with \nregional and global commitments.\n\u2022  Regional  comparisons  and  Asia\u2019s  engagement  with \nglobal  institutions  suggest  that  sovereignty  costs  are  not \ninsurmountable. Concerns over relinquishing policy autonomy \ncan be met through the design of delegation mechanisms and \nadequate representation for national governments.\n\u2022  Regional  economic  institutions  have  played  a  useful  role \nin  consolidating  gains  from  liberalization  and  preventing \nbacksliding by national governments. This suggests a possible \nrole for institutions in codifying the unilateral gains that have \nproduced \u201cFactory Asia\u201d (Baldwin 2009).\n\u2022  Groups  of  cooperating  governments  that  wish  to  pursue \ndeeper  economic  integration  have  several  institutional \nalternatives: increasing the degree of precision and obligation \n194", "Asia in Context: Regional Comparisons \nin  cooperative  agreements;  delegating  more  authority  to \nregional or subregional institutions; or using initial membership \nconditions to signal cooperative commitments. Successfully \nnetworked institutions could in turn coordinate their agendas \nand actions, producing a layered architecture directed toward \ndeeper integration, with different subregional or issue groups \nmoving at different speeds.\n\u2022  Setting  unique  institutional  boundaries  to  Asia  (whether \nASEAN+3,  ASEAN+6,  APEC,  or  some  other  grouping)  is \nneither desirable nor feasible. The boundaries of any particular \ncooperative project, embodied in an institution or institutions, \nwill  be  set  by  membership  criteria  that  should  be  clearly \nstipulated  to  reflect  member  governments\u2019  commitments. \nMembership  rules  should  allow  both  deeper  cooperation \namong  smaller  groups  of  regional  governments  and  the \nwidening of that cooperation to those that wish, over time, to \nenjoy the benefits of intensified economic exchange.\n\u2022  Elaborate regional institutions that are not implemented or used \nby member states are unlikely to deepen regional economic \ncooperation or integration.\nIntegrating  Asia\u2019s  remarkable  economic  success  is  likely  to \ndemand a new institutional architecture to consolidate its gains and \nsupport both a new agenda of deeper integration and the inclusion \nof new economic partners. That architecture need not imitate any \nother regional model, although Asia can learn from the experience of \nother regions. Given its scale and diversity, Asia\u2019s regional institutions \nare  likely  to  remain  a  complicated  network  that  incorporates \nsubregional groups of cooperating governments and a region-wide \npeak organization. Suggestions for a feasible and effective regional \narchitecture are presented in Chapter 6.\n195", "", "Chapter 6\nPolicy Options\n197", "Chapter 6\nPolicy Options\nT\nhe case for greater regional cooperation in Asia is broad, \ndeep,  and  compelling  (ADB  2008b).  Yet  marshaling \ncollective  efforts  across  this  vast,  diverse  region  is  a \nchallenge. As market-led regional economic integration \ndeepens, greater policy cooperation is needed in trade, \nfinance, and macroeconomic management, as well as on social, \nenvironmental,  and  infrastructure  issues.  Domestic  regulatory \nand  institutional  reforms\u2014such  as  pro-competitive  deregulation, \nimprovements in financial standards, enhancement of governance, \nand stronger social safety nets\u2014are essential for accomplishing these \nobjectives. More effective national institutions and closer cooperation \namong governments in the region would complement each other. \nAsia\u2019s growing importance in the global economy also demands \nmore  ambitious  and  coherent  regional  cooperation.  To  play  a \ngreater role in addressing global economic issues, the region must \nincreasingly act together\u2014not only out of self-interest but also to \nhelp maintain global economic prosperity. Asia has a huge stake in \nbolstering global economic stability and promoting open international \nmarkets. By pooling its strengths, it can have more influence on global \neconomic institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to Asia\u2019s benefit and that \nof the world. \nWhile  Asia\u2019s  interdependence  is  growing  and  economic \ncooperation is intensifying, the region\u2019s great diversity and complex \npolitics argue for flexibility and pragmatism in the scope, speed, \nsequencing, and style of economic cooperation. The architecture of \nregional cooperation in Asia is multitrack and multispeed, follows a \nbottom\u2013up approach, and has so far developed relatively light and lean \nregional institutions. While this flexibility is often seen as a weakness\u2014\n198", "Policy Options\nnot least because European regionalism is often, mistakenly, taken as \nthe benchmark\u2014it is in fact both a necessary and a desirable feature \nof the Asian model. Asia is not Europe, as emphasized in Chapter 5. \nAsia\u2019s distinctive approach to cooperation typically allows any group of \ncountries, economies, subregions, or territories to join the integration \nprocess and share in its benefits, regardless of its level of development. \nAnd as partnerships strengthen, they can lead to deeper and wider \ncollaboration. \nAsia\u2019s open, gradual, and flexible regionalism ensures that its \neconomic integration remains market-friendly and responsive to the \nregion\u2019s diverse economic, political, social, and cultural realities. As \ndetailed in Chapter 2, some economies are much more open and \neconomically advanced than others. Some have a long tradition of \npolitical stability, others have only just emerged from conflict. Some \nare more committed to regional cooperation, others have political \nregimes that strictly limit cross-border contact. \nSubregional institutions could continue to make the most of the \nregion\u2019s established bottom\u2013up approach, which supports subregional \ncooperation efforts as building blocks for an eventual broader and \nmore unified regional architecture. The Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) has already adopted this approach in its plan to \ncreate an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) through the \u201cASEAN-X \nprinciple,\u201d which allows two or more countries to pursue negotiations \nand agree to liberalize trade in services in any sector or subsectors, \nwith other countries joining in when they are ready.\nThe region\u2019s flexibility and pragmatism has many advantages. It \navoids costly and restrictive bureaucracy. It respects countries\u2019 differing \nneeds and sensitivities. And it allows the region to remain open to \nnewcomers and to the rest of the world. Regional cooperation is not \nan end in itself\u2014and in many cases a flexible, pragmatic approach can \ndeliver better results than a rigid, one-size-fits-all framework.\nBut following a model based only on flexibility and pragmatism \nhas limitations. Governments may be reluctant to make commitments \nto regional institutions that do not generate early tangible outcomes. \nThey are likely to resort to bilateral negotiations if they feel that broader \nregional cooperation is difficult\u2014even if the benefits from regional \ninitiatives  are  potentially  greater.  As  a  result,  important  regional \nobjectives are less likely to be realized than in the presence of stronger \ncooperation mechanisms. More effective and efficient institutions for \nregional integration (IRIs) are increasingly needed to manage Asia\u2019s \nexpanding challenges and opportunities.\n199", "Institutions for Regional Integration\n6.1. Asia\u2019s Long-Term Vision \nThe long-term vision for regional economic integration in Asia and the \nPacific was set out in the Emerging Asian Regionalism study of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) as \u201ca strong, prosperous, outward-looking \neconomic community, regionally integrated yet connected with global \nmarkets, and with responsibility and influence to match its economic \nimportance\u201d (ADB 2008b). The study described how an Asian economic \ncommunity would involve a single regional market, connected by \nintegrated  infrastructure  networks,  where  trade,  investment,  and \npeople could move freely, along with closer economic, monetary, and \nfinancial cooperation and perhaps even, ultimately, a single currency. \nThe creation of such an economic community requires Asia to \nevolve toward a new regional architecture made up of stronger IRIs \nwith greater powers delegated from their member countries and \ncloser links with each other. While an Asian economic community \ncannot\u2014and should not\u2014be achieved overnight, it is a long-term \ngoal which can inspire and guide leaders and policy-makers as they \ncraft responses to the region\u2019s short- and medium-term needs and \nchallenges.\nThe Emerging Asian Regionalism study (ADB 2008b) set out the \nrationale for strengthening regional cooperation toward the creation of \nan Asian economic community in the long run as follows:\n  \u2022  managing spillovers among economies resulting from closer \nmacroeconomic relations, greater capital and labor flows, and \nenvironmental degradation; \n  \u2022  liberalizing trade and investment flows beyond levels achievable \nthrough global and bilateral negotiations; \n  \u2022  developing regional infrastructure to strengthen transport and \nenergy connectivity within and across Asia\u2019s subregions;\n  \u2022  finding common solutions to cross-border challenges, such as \nimplementing mechanisms to head off epidemics, mobilizing \nresources  to  address  financial  crises,  and  introducing \nregulations to enable countries to integrate financial, goods, \nand services markets; \n  \u2022  exercising greater Asian influence in global economic forums \nto help sustain open and competitive global markets; and\n  \u2022  adding value to national policy-making by sharing experiences \nand best practices as well as exerting peer pressure among \nregional members\u2014including highlighting priorities that may be \nopposed by domestic special interests, introducing measures \n200", "Policy Options\nto enhance competition and regulatory oversight, adopting \npolicies  to  reduce  poverty  and  inequality,  and  controlling \nenvironmental externalities.\nAs  Chapter  2  explained,  Asia\u2019s  economic  cooperation  and \nintegration  has  emerged  over  the  past  few  decades  through  the \ncreation  of  production  networks,  initiatives  to  ensure  financial \nstability and the deepening and widening of financial markets, the \ndevelopment of regional infrastructure, and the provision of regional \npublic goods. Following these developments, the agenda for collective \naction in Table 6.1 sets out priorities and policy solutions that are steps \ntoward the creation of an Asian economic community. \nWith such a vision in mind, accomplishing an Asian economic \ncommunity would imply:\n  \u2022  an integrated market free of restrictions on flows of goods and \nservices; \n  \u2022  deeper and more liquid financial markets open to cross-border \nfinancial flows, with high standards of oversight and strong \nprotection for national and foreign investors; \n  \u2022  effective frameworks for coordinating macroeconomic and \nexchange-rate policies, taking into account global challenges \nand differing national circumstances; \n  \u2022  regional forums and dialogues to address vital social issues, \nsuch as poverty, exclusion, income insecurity, migration, aging, \nhealth, and environmental threats; and\n  \u2022  a consistent voice to project regional concerns in global policy \nforums and enhance responsible global governance. \nMaking the vision of a region-wide economic community a reality \nwill require countries in Asia and the Pacific to strengthen their IRIs, \nmaking  them  more  effective  institutions,  adequately  staffed,  and \nable to provide first-rate analytical and logistical support. Stronger \ninstitutions are needed to complement the market-driven integration \nthat Asia has experienced so far. As set out in Chapter 1, they are key \nto cementing past gains (notably the development of regional supply \nchains and production networks, and  expansion of intraregional \ncooperation),  further  deepening  the  integration  process  (notably \nby moving from commodity market integration to financial market \nintegration and macroeconomic policy coordination), and broadening \nregional integration (building links between South Asia and East Asia \nas well as with other subregions, and incorporating economies that \nhave so far been excluded from the process, notably some of Asia\u2019s \nrelatively low-income economies).\n201", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nTable 6.1.

Preceding chapters, \nnotably the inventory of IRIs in Chapter 4 and the comparisons in \nChapter  5,  point  to  the  following  observations  as  guidelines  for \ninstitution building.\n  (i)  Asia\u2019s approach to regional integration is pragmatic and flexible, \nresulting in a multitrack and multispeed process. It has adapted \nits cooperative structures to the varied priorities of Asia\u2019s diverse \neconomies and subgroups thereof. Regional cooperation and \nintegration in Asia have tended to follow a bottom\u2013up approach \nthat supports subregional cooperation efforts as building blocks \nfor an eventual broader and more unified regional architecture.\n  (ii)  Asia possesses a dense web of IRIs: our stocktaking exercise \nlists 40\u2014overarching, functional, and facilitating; covering part \nor all of its five subregions, Asia and the Pacific as a whole, or \nlinking Asia with other regions of the world.\n  (iii)  Any attempt to create an institutional architecture capable of \nmeeting the challenges of Asian integration must start from \nthose existing IRIs that are firmly established. As the survey of \nAsian opinion leaders for this study shows, there is in general \nmore support for strengthening the region\u2019s existing IRIs than \nfor creating new ones, especially at the subregional level. \n  (iv)  Most of Asia\u2019s IRIs are intergovernmental in structure, take \ndecisions by consensus, and involve the delegation of only \nlimited powers to independent secretariats and other extra-\ngovernmental  bodies.  There  is,  however,  evidence  that \ngovernments  are  willing  to  embrace  different  institutional \narrangements when they realize that the advantages of doing so \nare great. Some IRIs, such as ASEAN, have expressed interest in \nbuilding stronger secretariats to which member governments \nmay be prepared to delegate more effective authority to handle \nsome aspects of common regional policies; others are moving \ntoward making decisions through qualified majority voting as \nwell as by consensus, as in the case of the Chiang Mai Initiative \nMultilateralisation (CMIM). \n  (v)  Asia\u2019s distinctive institutional architecture reflects its political, \neconomic, and social characteristics. It is thus less likely to \nadopt a European-style approach with strong supranational \ninstitutions. The pronounced diversity of Asia\u2019s economies and \nsocieties represents a major challenge for institution building. \nMoreover, Asian countries that were created only a few decades \nago following a period of colonization understandably tend to \n203", "Institutions for Regional Integration\ngive regional issues a much lower priority than building national \nidentity and domestic institutions.\n  (vi)  Regional  and  global  integration  are  not  alternatives.  Asia\u2019s \neconomies  are  continuing  to  integrate  globally  as  well  as \nregionally. Asia\u2019s regional architecture should remain compatible \nwith global integration and a strengthening of global governance. \nUnfortunately,  Asian  countries\u2019  obligations  to  regional  and \nglobal institutions are not always implemented and interpreted \nuniformly across the region. Asia\u2019s exceptional economic and \npolitical diversity makes for enormous variation in governments\u2019 \ncapacity to bring national practice in line with those obligations. \n  (vii)  While Asian integration has been heavily driven by economic \nlogic,  there  is  also  a  broad  preference  in  the  region  for \ndeepening political and security cooperation and elaborating its \ncorresponding institutional architecture. A large-membership \nregional institution that combines economic, foreign policy, \nand security agendas would also permit programs of political \nreconciliation and possibly military confidence building that \nhave  been  instrumental  in  furthering  regional  economic \ncooperation elsewhere.\n6.2. Principles for Reform\nTo reform Asia\u2019s IRIs the region\u2019s policy-makers will have to tackle \nimportant issues related to national sovereignty and the extent of power \ndelegated to regional IRIs, the role played by secretariats (where they \nexist), membership and compliance rules, decision-making principles, \nstakeholders\u2019 participation, and the institutional linkages among Asia\u2019s \nIRIs and between regional and global institutions. These issues are \ndiscussed in the recommendations for reform that follow. But before \ndiscussing specific recommendations it is important to emphasize \ntwo general principles that can guide efforts and shape strategies for \nstrengthening Asia\u2019s IRIs: openness and transparency. \nOpenness. Asia\u2019s idea of \u201copen regionalism,\u201d which does not \ndiscriminate against non-members (Garnaut 1996), suggests that Asia\u2019s \nIRIs ought to make the most of global institutions and conventions. \nThese provide a basis for liberalizing and harmonizing arrangements\u2014\nboth at and behind the border\u2014where there is no strong presumption \nthat regional ones should differ from those in the rest of the world. \nThis is an effective way of ensuring that measures to cement Asian \nintegration also foster the region\u2019s links with the global economy. \n204", "Policy Options\nAt the same time, there needs to be a more efficient division of labor \nbetween global and regional institutions in areas where Asia has \nspecific needs and circumstances.\nThese points can be illustrated with reference to the 1980 United \nNations (UN) Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of \nGoods (CISG), which specifies the principles of sales law that should \nbe incorporated into national law and provide the basis for court or \narbitration decisions in the event of disputes. It applies to any contract \nbetween two parties whose governments have ratified the convention, \nunless it expressly states otherwise. The resulting legal uniformity \nsimplifies cross-border business and reduces uncertainty about the \nenforcement of contracts, while governments do not have to start from \nscratch in defining a basis on which to harmonize contract law. So \nfar, however, the only Asian countries that have ratified the CISG are \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of Korea, Japan, \nSingapore, Australia, and a handful of Central Asian nations. If more \nAsian governments did so, this would encourage trade and economic \nintegration both within the region and with the rest of the world. \nWhat is true of the CISG also applies to a variety of other global \nconventions. The International Institute for the Unification of Private \nLaw has drawn up 12 conventions designed to standardize legal \npractice  on  everything  from  financial  leasing  and  international \nfactoring  to  travel  contracts  and  internationally  intermediated \nsecurities.89 However, only a few Asian countries have signed any of \nthese conventions. The UN Commission on International Trade Law \nhas endorsed conventions on letters of credit (documentary credits), \ncontracts for the international carriage of goods by sea, cross-border \ninsolvency,  and  other  commercial  matters.90  Again,  only  a  small \nnumber of Asian countries have signed. The Hague Conference on \nPrivate International Law has promulgated conventions on contracts, \ntorts (such as product liability and traffic accidents), and securities \nheld with intermediaries, as well as on trusts and the recognition of \ncompanies, none of which has yet been adopted by Asian countries.91\n89  www.unidroit.org/English/conventions/c-main.htm\n90  www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts.html\n91  www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=text.display&tid=10#commerceH. Asian countries can \nadopt such conventions unilaterally. There are compelling arguments for why this is in their \ninterest. The question therefore is why more have not yet done so. It could be that, given \neven limited costs of changing legal provisions, there is a coordination problem. Individual \nAsian countries may be reluctant to move before other Asian countries with which they \ndo extensive business. Or it could be that costs of bringing domestic law and practice into \nconformity are nontrivial for countries with relatively limited institutional capacity. Both \nexplanations point to a role for regional facilitating bodies, such as ADB or the UN Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), in providing technical assistance \nand for country groupings such as ASEAN or ASEAN+3 in coordinating the response.\n205", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nTable 6.2.

ASEAN+3 (the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea) \ncountries recognized the IMF\u2019s experience in structuring emergency \nfinancial assistance and conditionality when developing the CMIM. \nUnder its provisions, countries are required to enter into a program \nwith the IMF in order to draw more than 20% of their CMIM quota. \nIn future, regional organizations\u2014alongside the IMF\u2014could act \nas \u201cfirst responders\u201d in the case of regional threats. This could avert \nthe criticism that the IMF reacts too slowly because it represents the \ninterests of countries outside the region, and it could better internalize \nspillovers  among  closely  linked  economies.  The  IMF\u2019s  European \nprograms implemented in 2008\u20132010 to address the financial crises \nin Iceland, Hungary, Latvia, Greece, and other countries represent \nearly examples of this kind of innovation. The negotiations with the \ncrisis countries included major European stakeholders, notably the \nEuropean Union (EU) and the European Central Bank (and Nordic \n206", "Policy Options\ngovernments in the case of Latvia). These stakeholders contributed \nroughly as much funding as the IMF. The newly created European \nFinancial Stability Facility designed to cope with the sovereign debt \ncrisis in Greece and potentially other euro-zone member countries had \nan even larger regional component: euro-zone countries contributed \n\u20ac600  billion,  while  the  IMF  contributed  \u20ac150  billion.  Replicating \nthis pattern in other regions would represent a major innovation \nin flexibility. In Asia, the CMIM provides an especially opportune \nfoundation for such complementary responsibilities. This could also \nallow the emergence of a new model of Asian collaboration with the \nIMF, drawing on Europe\u2019s example.92\nIn the area of development finance, the World Bank provides \ntechnical assistance and finance for development projects not just \non a self-standing basis but also in cooperation with Asia\u2019s IRIs. For \nexample,  senior  managers  from  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  meet \nannually to review their country programs and develop joint initiatives. \nThey also issue joint reports to staff. Reducing poverty and income \ndisparities  and  boosting  investment  and  growth  in  the  region\u2019s \nslower-growing economies are explicit goals of the Asian economic \ncommunity. Where their agendas overlap, ensuring the coherence of \nthe efforts of Asia\u2019s IRIs and global institutions is an essential element \nof shaping a new regional institutional architecture.\nIdeally,  global  multilateral  financial  institutions  should  focus \non  global  objectives  and  externalities,  such  as  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, climate change, food and energy security, and \nepidemics. They could also provide infrastructure for development \nfinance, including the collection and dissemination of knowledge \nand research findings. Regional development banks could focus on \nregional issues and externalities, such as infrastructure connectivity \nand  regional  environmental  protection.  They  could  also  support \nprojects funded and managed by the countries most interested in \nthem. A good example is the creation of the Credit Guarantee and \nInvestment  Facility  (CGIF)  as  ADB\u2019s  trust  fund  to  promote  local-\ncurrency bond markets in ASEAN+3 countries (see Chapters 2 and 4). \nSimilar initiatives could support cooperation and integration among \na selected number of members, although this would imply departing \nfrom current practice requiring a majority of members of (global and \nregional) development banks to approve their activities.\nIn  the  area  of  trade  liberalization,  trade  policies  could  be \nharmonized across Asia in a manner that strengthens the region\u2019s \n92  Section 6.5 discusses how an Asian Monetary Fund could evolve from the CMIM.\n207", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nintegration with the rest of the world by bringing national law and \npractice into conformity with WTO protocols\u2014which cover trade \nin goods and services, as well as intellectual property rights\u2014a \nstrategy that has worked well previously. The Information Technology \nAgreement  negotiated  after  the  first  WTO  ministerial  has  been \na  successful  basis  for  harmonizing  policy  toward  information \ntechnology and elaborating regional electronics supply chains. The \nAnnex on Basic Telecommunications Services has facilitated the \nharmonization and integration of telecommunications infrastructure \nin the region. Several Asian economies have also signed up to the \nWTO\u2019s Government Procurement Agreement, thereby harmonizing \ntheir  procurement  practices  with  those  of  their  external  trade \npartners.\nUnfortunately, the WTO\u2019s Doha Round negotiations have stalled, \nwhile regional agreements continue to proliferate. There is no link \nbetween these tracks, which should ideally coalesce into larger, even \nglobal, agreements. The WTO would have much to offer in crafting and \nadministering regional trade arrangements, ranging from analytical \nservices to dispute resolution. A link between regional and global \nprocesses could address the challenge of making regional free trade \nagreements (FTAs) more multilateral-friendly, for example by using \nstandard approaches to address vexing issues, such as rules of origin. In \nAsia, wide-ranging discussions are under way concerning the formation \nof a region-wide FTA, possibly by connecting complex, overlapping \nFTAs into one simplified agreement, as articulated in Section 6.5. With \nAsian FTAs unified, it would also be easier for regional economies to \nnegotiate transregional FTAs with North America (through Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation\u2014APEC) and Europe (through the Asia-Europe \nMeeting\u2014ASEM), providing in turn a path to global trade integration \n(Kawai and Wignaraja 2010).\nIn the area of financial stability, the finance sector assessment \nprograms that the IMF conducts jointly with the World Bank are a \nuseful input into the process of strengthening and integrating national \nfinancial  markets.  The  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision \nand the Financial Stability Board (FSB), both of which have Asian \nrepresentation, are the basis for global efforts to set capital adequacy \nstandards for banks, supervise nonbank financial institutions including \nhedge  funds  and  private  equity  funds,  formulate  policies  toward \noffshore financial centers, and generally strengthen the supervision and \nregulation of financial markets. More recently, they have promulgated \nstandards and defined best practice for a range of financial stability \nissues  highlighted  by  the  2007/08  crisis,  such  as  liquidity  and \n208", "Policy Options\nprovisioning practices. By bringing national regulation and practice \ninto compliance with Basel Committee and FSB standards, supervision \nand regulation within Asia could be harmonized so as to promote the \nintegration of regional financial markets while strengthening their links \nto global ones.\nThe recent global financial crisis has highlighted the need for \nan  international  framework  to  monitor,  regulate,  and  supervise \ncross-border  transactions,  including  the  activities  of  systemically \nimportant financial firms and products. The FSB has been tasked \nwith establishing such a framework and coordinating the authorities \ncharged with implementing it. It is also charged, in collaboration \nwith the IMF, with providing early warning of macroeconomic and \nfinancial risks and proposing actions to remedy them. The same issues \nare being addressed in Europe by the new European Systemic Risk \nBoard, which is mandated to oversee macroprudential regulation \nand supervision, and by a European system of financial supervisors \nfor banking, insurance, and securities markets. A structure similar \nto the European one should be developed in Asia. An important first \nstep would be to create an Asian Financial Stability Dialogue (AFSD), \nas discussed in Section 6.5, to promote financial stability, assist in \nlong-term financial market development, and establish standards for \ngovernance and transparency in the region. Such an institution could \nplay a valuable role by translating FSB initiatives into a regional context \nand then helping to implement them.\nTransparency. The perception survey of opinion leaders in the \nregion conducted for this study (Appendix 1) suggests that governing \nprinciples  and  decision-making  structures  urgently  need  to  be \nimproved so as to strengthen overarching subregional institutions \nsuch as ASEAN, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \n(SAARC), and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF).93 \nTransparency  is  one  obvious  mechanism  for  enhancing  the \naccountability of Asia\u2019s IRIs and strengthening their governance. While \nsome IRIs have become more transparent, they generally remain the \nonly source of information on their actions, without a proper feedback \nmechanism, making it hard for stakeholders to distinguish aspirations \n93  Consider, for instance, this quote from Ong Keng Yong, former ASEAN secretary-general, \nat the ASEAN-European Commission Regional Symposium in November 2005: \u201cWithout \ngiving a voice to the many partners involved in ASEAN\u2019s agenda and priorities and without a \nsystematic and open accounting of the resources and policies needed, ASEAN would not be \nable to achieve the desired outcome of its plans and programs. The rule of law and effective \nregulations are essential to realizing the objectives of the AEC and other goals of ASEAN \ncommunity building. There is an acceptance of such attributes of good governance.\u201d\n209", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nfrom achievements. Establishing compliance boards\u2014independent \nentities composed of business and academic members to assess \nprogress  in  achieving  the  institutions\u2019  mandates  and  effectively \nimplementing  their  operations\u2014would  help.  Global  institutions \nhave already moved in this direction. The IMF has established the \nIndependent Evaluation Office, staffed in part by outside experts, which \nmakes its reports available to the public.94 The WTO has created the \nTextiles Monitoring Body to monitor implementation of its Agreement \non Textiles and Clothing.\nMore  generally,  it  would  be  desirable  to  encourage  greater \nparticipation in Asia\u2019s IRIs by civil society members who support the \ngoals of regional integration. If national governments, for whatever \nreason, chose to slow regional economic integration or renege on \ntheir  regional  commitments,  suitably  empowered  private  actors \nwhich would benefit from further integration might then be able to use \nregional institutions to revitalize the process, interpret agreed rules, \nand prevent further backsliding, as the EU example shows (Chapter 3). \nAsia\u2019s IRIs, from this point of view, remain too isolated from the \nsocieties they serve. \nThis can be corrected by institutional reform. In Europe, complaints \nthat regional integration suffered from a \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d led to \nprovision in the EU\u2019s 2009 Lisbon Treaty for a new form of public \nparticipation in shaping policy, the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative, which \nenables EU citizens to petition the European Commission (EC) to bring \nforward an initiative of interest to them in an area of EU competence. \nSignatures must be obtained from at least 1 million citizens from a \nsignificant number of member states. \nLess ambitiously, Asia\u2019s IRIs could convene outreach seminars \nso that a broad range of voices are heard before reaching policy \ndecisions. In Europe, for example, EU Trade Commissioner Karel \nDe Gucht has brought together representatives from, among others, \nnongovernmental organizations, business and industry associations, \nconsumer groups, trade unions, employers\u2019 organizations, faith-based \ngroups, and research institutes to provide input into an EC proposal for \nregional trade policy reform. Box 6.1 elaborates on how to involve civil \nsociety in Asian IRIs.\nAs well as suggesting that Asian regionalism should be open \nand  more  transparent,  this  report  offers  three  sets  of  specific \nrecommendations  for  shaping  a  new  institutional  architecture  in \n94  ADB also has an Independent Evaluation Department that conducts an assessment of its \npolicies, strategies, programs, and projects, including their design, implementation, and \nresults (www.adb.org/Evaluation/about/default.asp)\n210", "Policy Options\nBox 6.1.

Strengthening Overarching \nInstitutions \nOverarching IRIs play a key role in the Asian integration process. Both \nsubregional and intraregional institutions need to be strengthened, \nwhile intraregional ones also need to be rationalized. Four of Asia and \nthe Pacific\u2019s five subregions have an overarching institution that needs \nto become more effective: ASEAN in Southeast Asia, SAARC in South \nAsia, PIF in the Pacific, and the Trilateral Summit (TS) in Northeast \nAsia.95 (As discussed in Chapter 4, Central Asia does not yet have an \noverarching IRI.96) They need to create more effective, autonomous \nsecretariats, equipped with stronger agenda-setting and surveillance \npowers, adequate financial and human resources, and clear legal \nmandates; establish clearer and more objective membership rules; \ndevelop enhanced decision-making rules; and build stronger links \nboth with each other and with national agencies in order to promote \ncloser integration among Asia\u2019s subregions. At the intraregional level, \nASEAN+3 and the East Asia Summit (EAS) both need to establish a \nsecretariat. \nStronger secretariats. There have been a number of proposals for \ncreating stronger, more independent secretariats that could help IRIs \nset their increasingly complex agendas, issue forthright assessments \nof national policy untainted by political considerations, better support \n95  Although the TS is newer and less comprehensive than the others, it has recently emerged \nas an important IRI and has great potential to strengthen economic cooperation and \n integration among its members, with considerable influence on the wider East Asian region.\n96  The Economic Cooperation Organization, Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC), and \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) are not classified as overarching \n subregional IRIs for Central Asia either because they include countries outside the s ubregion, \nor because, in the case of CAREC, it is not governed by a summit of political leaders. \n212", "Policy Options\nefforts to encourage policy coordination within the region, and monitor \ncountries\u2019 compliance with their integration obligations.\nMore ambitiously, stronger secretariats could publish scorecards \nof countries\u2019 compliance with their integration obligations. To provide \nfurther insulation from politics, such scoring could be outsourced \nto  an  independent  third  party.  Ratings  would  cover  both  policy \ninputs (such as whether relevant legal and regulatory changes had \nbeen undertaken or budgetary procedures had been reformed in \nthe recommended manner) and policy outputs (such as whether \nnational market prices had converged with prices elsewhere in the \ngrouping or budget and current account balances had been reduced \nto recommended levels).97\nASEAN has recently made progress in this direction. Its secretariat, \nwhich is tasked with monitoring and assessing the implementation \nof the AEC Blueprint, has developed a scorecard and conducted \nits first assessment in May 2009. However, the secretariat was not \nauthorized to reveal the final scores to the public and some ASEAN \nmembers questioned the usefulness of the secretariat\u2019s approach, \narguing that it was little more than a checklist of individual members\u2019 \nactions and provided no guidance as to how they should prioritize \nwhat still needs to be done. Some ASEAN members then asked \nthe  newly  established  Economic  Research  Institute  for  ASEAN \nand East Asia, an intergovernmental policy think-tank, to develop a \nmore analytical approach to monitoring and assessment. A steering \ncommittee composed of the chair of the ASEAN High Level Task Force, \na representative of ASEAN\u2019s secretariat, and the chair of a network \nof various East Asian research institutes was formed to guide the \nprocess.98 These are potentially significant steps toward more effective \nsurveillance within ASEAN.\nFinancial  resources. Effective secretariats will need adequate \nfinancial resources. Two key issues\u2014the size of the secretariat\u2019s budget \n97  The procedure might be undertaken annually. A study on ASEAN by McKinsey & \nCompany (2004) offers suggestions along these lines. That said, the limitations of existing \nmechanisms for multilateral surveillance provide grounds for caution. IMF surveillance, \nespecially of large countries that do not borrow from the IMF, is not particularly effective. \nGiven that there has been a reluctance to make the IMF\u2019s surveillance more independent \nof its members, it might also be difficult to move toward vigorous independent surveillance \nat the regional level. Even so, there is a clear ongoing attempt to strengthen multilateral \nsurveillance: witness, for example, G20 governments\u2019 commitment at their September \n2009 Pittsburgh summit to empower the IMF to organize peer reviews of big-country \npolicies. There is reason to think that sentiment in Asia will gravitate in the same direction.\n98  Some countries initially insisted that all ASEAN members be represented on the steering \ncommittee, which suggests that they are still uncomfortable with delegating this task to an \nindependent body.\n213", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nand how it is funded\u2014are linked. In the case of ASEAN, the principle \nof \u201cequal contribution\u201d tightly constrains the secretariat\u2019s finances and \nmakes it dependent on external funding, since its budget is limited \nto what the smallest ASEAN economy (the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic) can afford. Asia\u2019s IRIs\u2014especially overarching, subregional \nones\u2014would  be  more  effective  if  member  countries\u2019  budget \ncontributions were proportional to their gross domestic product, as is \nthe case in the EU. While bigger contributors might then demand a larger \nvoting share, decision-making mechanisms can be designed such that \nsmall countries retain an important say. Another option is for individual \nmember countries to fund various secretariat activities directly, as is the \ncase with SAARC centers funded by their different host countries.\nHuman resources. Effective secretariats also require a strong \nanalytical and administrative capacity. In particular, they need to be \nable to attract world-class professionals by offering a competitive \nsalary and benefits scheme and to develop a regional agenda from \nthe perspective of the IRI rather than that of its member countries. \nThis implies creating proper career positions in the secretariat that \ngo beyond, for example, the typical three-year secondments to the \nsecretariats of ASEAN, SAARC, and other Asian IRIs.\nRegional  opinion  leaders  support  further  movement  in  this \ndirection. For example, two-thirds of survey respondents think that \nincreasing the financial and human resources of ASEAN\u2019s secretariat \nis a high priority, as Figure 6.1 shows; and 57% think ASEAN urgently \nneeds to create a truly regional bureaucracy with permanent staff \npositions. A majority (58%) think delegating more powers from national \ninstitutions to ASEAN is a priority \nIn the case of SAARC, 58% of respondents think increasing the \nfinancial and human resources of its secretariat is a priority; the figure \nis 46% in the case of PIF (Figure 6.2). Respondents think the top priority \nfor these two IRIs should be improving their governance and decision-\nmaking structures.\nLegal mandate. IRIs\u2019 secretariats also require a clear legal \nmandate that defines their roles and responsibilities and those of \nthe secretary-general and other key titleholders, so that everyone \nknows what they can (and cannot) do; the stocktaking exercise \nin Chapter 4 suggests that Asia\u2019s IRIs tend to have either a limited \nand narrow mandate or none at all. For example, the secretaries-\ngeneral of overarching subregional IRIs ought to have the power \nto represent their institutions in regional and global forums, as the \nEC  president  does.

One example of this is the ASEAN Charter, which was \ndescribed in detail in Box 4.2. \nIn the case of ASEAN+3, developing appropriate decision-making \nrules is a crucial part of managing the relationships between ASEAN \nand the \u201cPlus Three\u201d countries. While growing spillovers among their \neconomies argues for closer cooperation with ASEAN+3, one constraint \non taking up more issues is ASEAN countries\u2019 worry that decision-\nmaking will be disproportionately dominated by the larger \u201cPlus Three\u201d \nmembers.99 ASEAN members may also be uncertain about whether \nthe large countries are prepared to pursue deep integration. For their \npart, the large countries would presumably resist letting smaller ASEAN \nnations drive the process. They would thus be likely to resist majority \nvoting rules along the lines of \u201cone country, one vote\u201d that might allow \ncoalitions of small countries to dictate decisions. A system of weighted \nvoting, where voting shares are related to country size but small \ncountries are disproportionately represented, could strike a balance. \nThe  CMIM,  where  a  voting  rule  along  these  lines  has  been \nadopted,  suggests  that  this  approach  is  feasible.  Since  providing \nemergency financial assistance speedily in a crisis is vital, the CMIM \ncan disburse loans quickly and take other operational decisions by \nqualified majority vote, while the consensus approach is still used \nfor deciding on other issues of a fundamentally strategic nature.100 \nOther conceivable approaches include supermajority thresholds for \ndecision-making requiring, for example, two-thirds of participating \ncountries to agree in order for a proposal to carry, or double majority \nvoting\u2014where a decision must be supported by a specified majority \nof countries and countries whose populations constitute a specified \nmajority of the population of the region. \nInstitutional linkages.

One useful reform would \nbe to establish a dialogue among overarching subregional institutions \nsuch  as  ASEAN,  SAARC,  and  PIF.  Figure  6.3  shows  that  68%  of \nrespondents believe that overarching subregional IRIs should offer \neach other observer status and 67% believe that the activities of Asia\u2019s \nmajor IRIs should be better coordinated. Functional and overarching \nIRIs in each subregion should also coordinate their activities. For \nexample,  institutions  such  as  the  Brunei  Darussalam-Indonesia-\nMalaysia-Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area  (BIMP-EAGA)  and \nIndonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) may increase \ntheir effectiveness by strengthening their ties with ASEAN\u2019s secretariat.\nIn addition to ASEAN, major powers such as India and the PRC \ncould also assume a pivotal role in linking Asia\u2019s IRIs from East, \nSouth, and Central Asia through new intergovernmental mechanisms. \nNew approaches might also be needed to draw certain countries or \nprovinces in critical geographical nodes into regional cooperation and \nprovide opportunities for peripheral areas to connect with the centers \nof regional economic growth. \nAs discussed in Section 6.2, Asia\u2019s IRIs also ought to strengthen \ntheir ties with global institutions, to capture synergies, stress their \ncomplementary roles, and represent Asia\u2019s interests in global forums \nmore effectively. Several Asian IRIs participate, for example, in G20 \nactivities. The Executives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia Pacific Central Banks \n(EMEAP) and the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) contribute on \ntechnical issues related to financial market regulation, and the secretary-\ngeneral and chair of ASEAN are invited to participate in meetings.

As  well  as  being  strengthened,  overarching \nintraregional  IRIs  such  as  ASEAN+3  and  the  EAS  need  to  be \nrationalized. Their responsibilities should be clarified, identifying each \ninstitution with a core competency and ensuring that these do not \noverlap unnecessarily. This is in line with the results of the ADB survey, \nwhich suggest that the activities of ASEAN+3 and the EAS ought to be \nmore focused (Figure 6.4). The survey also suggests that they should \nstrengthen their linkages with national agencies in their member \ncountries, create their own secretariats, and widen their membership.\nASEAN+3, which was established in response to the 1997/98 \nAsian financial crisis, has had a very clear focus on regional financial \n219", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nFigure 6.4.

In recent years, however, it has also moved to cover trade \nand investment, rural development, and poverty eradication, as well as \nthe provision of regional public goods in areas such as natural disaster \nmanagement and environmental protection (ASEAN+3 Cooperation \nWork Plan 2007\u20132017). The EAS is more political in nature and, given \nits overlap in membership with ASEAN+3, it is struggling to identify a \nspecific focus, although it is doing a lot of work on trade and investment. \nIn line with recent trends, a natural division of labor would be for \nASEAN to focus on regional infrastructure development, through the \ncreation of an ASEAN infrastructure investment fund, ASEAN+3 on \nfinancial cooperation, through initiatives such as the CMIM, and the \nEAS on trade and investment cooperation, with recent discussions on \nforming a regional free trade zone.\n220", "Policy Options\n6.4. Developing Functional Institutions \nGroups  of  countries  sometimes  have  particularly  attractive \nopportunities for cooperation that can only be reaped by investing in \nIRIs. In some cases this will entail subregions learning from and/or  \nreplicating  achievements  and  experiences  elsewhere.  This  is  an \nimportant reason why functional IRIs that promote the development of \ncertain Asian subregions, such as the Central Asian Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC), the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), and the \nSouth Asian Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) programs, \nwould benefit from strengthening their ties. Functional institutions \nthat operate in similar areas would also benefit from closer ties and \ncoordination. For example, since both EMEAP and ABMI seek to \npromote the development of Asia\u2019s bond markets, they could share \ntechnical information or grant each other observer status. In other \ncases it will involve building institutions to foster cooperation in entirely \nnew functions and areas.\nCountries that cooperate need not be immediate neighbors. For \nexample, EMEAP\u2019s Asian Bond Fund initiative, which seeks to promote \nlocal-currency  bond  markets,  brings  together  a  geographically \ndisparate subset of East Asian and Pacific economies whose central \nbanks are committed to this aim. Often, though, there are opportunities \nfor  cooperation  among  neighboring  countries.  For  instance, \nlinking national highway and rail systems or developing integrated \ntransnational transport systems promotes market integration.101\nIdeally one might work toward an integrated pan-Asian system \nof railways, roads, and navigable rivers. But coordinating ambitious \nprojects at the regional level is difficult. The returns, meanwhile, \nare likely to be greatest for links between specific, often contiguous, \nprovincial and local economies. This is a rationale for why a subset \nof governments, typically in a particular subregion, might establish \nspecialized institutions for advancing these projects.\nOne example is the Cross-Border Transport Agreement of the GMS. \nThis is a legal instrument, which entered into force at the end of 2003 \nand provides for the negotiation of common road and bridge design \nstandards, road signs, and signals; ensures the exchange of commercial \ntraffic rights; and establishes requirements that road vehicles must meet \nin order to be eligible for cross-border traffic. It provides for simplified \nvisa application processes for people involved in cross-border transport \n101  Two reviews and analyses of the role of infrastructure in facilitating intraregional trade are \nFrancois, Manchin, and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2009) and ADB/ADBI (2009). \n221", "Institutions for Regional Integration\noperations and single-stop/single-window customs inspection. Such a \ncompelling functional opportunity for cooperation could be usefully \nreplicated in other subregions, such as South Asia.\nSubregions may also be able to learn from others\u2019 experiences. \nFor example, a transport-sector strategy for the GMS was developed \nin 2005 with technical assistance from ADB and adopted by national \ngovernments the following year. This has enabled the countries of the \nsubregion to coordinate the development of north\u2013south and east\u2013west  \nroad transport corridors and improve inland water navigation and port \nsystems. These coordinated investments have fostered subregional \nintegration and encouraged faster upgrading of national infrastructure, \nsince the benefits of such investment are greater in the presence of \ncomplementary investments in adjoining countries. In August 2010, \nwith the support of ADB and other development partners, GMS countries \nendorsed a comprehensive plan to improve regional infrastructure \nin order to bolster economic growth. The program covers transport, \nenergy,  trade  facilitation,  telecommunications,  human  resources \ndevelopment,  environment  and  natural  resources  management, \ntourism, and agriculture.\nAnother helpful step is the GMS Economic Corridor Initiative \n(Wu 2010). Establishing an economic corridor\u2014a transborder space, \ntypically straddling a central transport artery, with the infrastructure, \nlogistics, and policy support needed for integrated production\u2014can \nhelp create an efficient production platform and act as a magnet \nfor foreign investment. Countries straddling the artery cooperate in \nharmonizing  infrastructure  and  urban  development,  streamlining \nborder formalities, and otherwise facilitating exchange and integrated \nactivity within the corridor. In the GMS context, this can be thought \nof  as  developing  the  ancillary  transport  and  \u201csoft\u201d  infrastructure \nneeded to complement the north\u2013south and east\u2013west road transport \nnetworks on which the Cross-Border Transport Agreement has so far \nconcentrated. While still in its early stages, progress is under way. \nDrawing on experience in the GMS, similar agreements governing \nboth the \u201chardware\u201d and \u201csoftware\u201d of transport infrastructure among \nneighboring countries could be usefully pursued in other parts of Asia. \nOther  promising  areas  for  future  cooperation  include  health, \ndisaster management, and student exchanges. The emerging infectious \ndiseases  program  of  ASEAN+3,  for  example,  aims  to  enhance \nregional preparedness and capacity through integrated approaches \nto prevention, surveillance, and timely responses to new threats such \nas SARS, avian influenza, and a potential pandemic.

The innovative ASEAN Agreement \non Disaster Management and Emergency Response, which came into \nforce at the end of 2009, requires signatories to identify disaster risk \nareas, establish early warning systems, draw up standard operating \nprocedures for providing disaster relief, and cooperate on technology \nand  scientific  research.  A  program  detailing  these  activities  for  \n2010\u20132015 is under development with the UN International Strategy \nfor Disaster Reduction and Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre. Also, \nsince the early 1990s Australia, Japan, and some ASEAN countries have \nparticipated in University Mobility in Asia and the Pacific, which works \nto facilitate student exchanges. ASEAN and ASEM also organize youth, \narts, and cultural exchanges.\nFinancial cooperation is a particularly important area. East Asia \nis leading the way through ASEAN+3 and EMEAP, and other parts of \nAsia could learn from its experience. In May 2010, ASEAN+3 members \nagreed to establish the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office \n(AMRO) to conduct regional financial surveillance. The next step \nwould be to endow AMRO with appropriate financial and human \nresources  and  authorize  it  to  prepare  comprehensive  analyses, \nassessments,  and  discussion  papers  to  support  the  operation  of \nthe CMIM and ASEAN+3\u2019s Economic Review and Policy Dialogue \n(ERPD).  By  organizing  frank  peer  reviews  of  members\u2019  policies, \nAMRO would strengthen the CMIM, since more effective surveillance \nwould encourage governments to undertake necessary policy reforms \nand hence increase their partners\u2019 willingness to lend. Moreover, as \nAsia\u2019s growing economic interdependence increases the importance \nof  maintaining  regional  exchange-rate  stability,  a  basket  of  Asian \ncurrencies (an Asian currency unit) could be used as an objective \nmetric, as Box 6.2 explains.\nAnother important ASEAN+3 initiative is the ABMI. Together with \nindividual national reforms, this has contributed to the growth of local-\ncurrency-denominated bond markets in emerging East Asia. Under the \nABMI, member countries have announced the creation of the CGIF, \nsetting up a group of experts from public and private sector institutions \nto consider establishing a regional intermediary to enhance cross-\nborder settlement infrastructure as well as measures to harmonize \ncross-border  regulations  and  strengthen  domestic  credit  rating \nmechanisms.

Establishing New and Stronger \nPan-Asian Institutions \nWhile  a  range  of  issues  requiring  cooperation  can  be  dealt  with \neffectively at the subregional or intraregional level, wider issues are \nbetter addressed at the level of Asia and the Pacific as a whole. This will \nrequire building new pan-Asian institutions while strengthening the two \nexisting ones, ADB and the UN Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which play important roles as facilitating \nIRIs. Ultimately, new pan-Asian institutions could be gathered under an \numbrella organization, such as a Council of Asian Economic Cooperation \n(CAEC) that would act as a coordinating body governed at the highest \npolitical level. In particular, new pan-regional institutions could include: \n  \u2022  a  Pan-Asian  Infrastructure  Forum  (PAIF)  to  address  the \nincreasing needs of regional infrastructure development; \n  \u2022  an Asia-Wide Free Trade Area (Asia-FTA) to facilitate trade and \ninvestment integration by consolidating existing bilateral and \nplurilateral FTAs; \n  \u2022  an  Asian  Monetary  Fund  (AMF)  to  conduct  regional \nmacroeconomic surveillance and provide financial assistance \nin case of crises;\n  \u2022  an  Asian  Financial  Stability  Dialogue  to  address  regional \nfinancial stability and regulatory issues, while promoting the \ndevelopment of Asia\u2019s financial markets; \n  \u2022  an  Asian  Legal  Advisory  Council  (ALAC)  to  improve  the \npredictability of legal obligations by ensuring that international \nagreements are implemented and interpreted uniformly across \nthe region; and \n  \u2022  several  regional  public  goods  forums  (RPGFs)  to  promote \nregional cooperation in dealing with issues such as natural \ncalamities, climate change, and health concerns. \nPan-Asian  Infrastructure  Forum.  The  approach  to  regional \ninfrastructure cooperation in Asia has been flexible, pragmatic, and \nmarket-driven. While existing pan-Asian initiatives such as the Asian \nLand Transport Infrastructure Development\u2014which comprises the \nAsian Highway, the Trans-Asian Railway, and the facilitation of land \ntransport projects through intermodal transport terminals\u2014have made \nsome progress, much more needs to be done (Chapter 2). \nIn view of Asia\u2019s diverse needs and circumstances, and varying \npolitical commitment to closer integration, overlapping subregional \nprograms proceeding at different speeds and on different tracks have \n226", "Policy Options\noffered the best way forward. Cooperation in small groups, from \nthe bottom up, has also proven more manageable and thus likely \nto progress faster than top\u2013down programs and projects, especially \nwhen group members have common objectives and reasonably good \nrelations. But while national programs and cooperation for subregional \ninfrastructure development will continue to be the building blocks \nin the creation of pan-Asian infrastructure networks, the need to \nrebalance Asia\u2019s economy toward increasing domestic demand to \nsatisfy local needs requires prioritizing improvements in connectivity \nwithin the region (Chapter 2). There is a growing case, therefore, for \ncomplementing the region\u2019s traditional approach to this problem with \na more market-creating and demand-inducing approach.\nThe Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia study (ADB/ADBI 2009) \nrecommended that a PAIF be established to help coordinate and \nintegrate  existing  subregional  infrastructure  initiatives.  Such  an \ninstitution would bring together the region\u2019s key stakeholders and help \nbuild consensus and prioritize and coordinate regional infrastructure \nplans. In particular, a PAIF could help develop harmonized regulatory \nand  legal  standards  based  on  international  best  practices,  while \ncontributing to the development of a common framework for handling \nand mitigating negative social and environmental impacts. Following \nthe recommendations of the Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia study, \na PAIF would need to work closely with an advisory group of experts \nto develop a pan-regional vision of Asia\u2019s infrastructure needs and \nidentify and appraise prospective projects.103 \nThe  report  also  proposed  the  establishment  of  an  Asian \nInfrastructure Fund (AIF) to help mobilize international funds and \nprepare and finance bankable regional infrastructure projects. The AIF\u2019s \ncapital could come from a variety of sources, including governments, \nmultilateral development banks, bilateral agencies, sovereign wealth \nfunds, and Islamic financial institutions. The AIF should have a legal \nidentity in order to help finance projects through its own resources, as \nwell as by issuing bonds and cofinancing with other entities, including \nprivate investors.\nTo  encourage  private  sector  participation  and  cross-border \ninvestment flows, Asia could formulate a comprehensive investment \nagreement, as ASEAN has, to extend national treatment to foreign \ninvestors.  The  AIF  would  help  finance  projects  identified  and \n103  To varying degrees, the EC performs this role in the EU, as does the Initiative for the \nIntegration of Regional Infrastructure in South America in that region.

It would therefore need a facility to expedite \nand help finance the preparation of projects, as well as one to provide \ngrants and concessional financing to encourage countries to prioritize \nregional projects in their national development programs. It may also \nneed to provide guarantees against major risks (ADB/ADBI 2009).\nAsia-Wide Free Trade Area. Bilateral and plurilateral FTAs have \nplayed an important role in deepening trade links in the region. But \nthey divert trade as well as creating it, resulting in a \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d of \noverlapping FTAs that creates complications for Asian trade as well as \nfacilitating it (Chapter 2).104 A solution to this problem is to consolidate \nexisting bilateral and plurilateral FTAs into a comprehensive Asia-Wide \nFree Trade Area (Asia-FTA) that would also liberalize investment. \nEurope\u2019s  experience  suggests  that  region-wide  free  trade  and \ninvestment can stimulate efficiency and growth.105 \nAn  Asia-FTA  would  eliminate  domestic  policy  distortions  to \nintra-Asian  trade  and  investment,  enhance  the  region\u2019s  business \nenvironment, and could even help unblock the WTO\u2019s Doha Round, \nas many of the concessions on agricultural and industrial goods and \nservices might already be incorporated into the agreement (Kawai \nand Wignaraja forthcoming). It would also boost intraregional trade \nand investment through the formation of a larger regional market, the \nrealization of economies of scale, and the facilitation of technology \ntransfers. Ultimately\u2014by fostering regional demand\u2014it would favor \na rebalancing of Asia\u2019s economic growth and offer insurance against \nrising protectionist sentiments. \nOne practical way forward would be to take the best features from \nexisting regional FTAs and design a \u201cboilerplate\u201d regional agreement \nthat is both comprehensive in scope and consistent with WTO rules. \nA \u201cWTO-plus\u201d Asia-FTA\u2014going beyond Uruguay Round commitments \nand current offers in the WTO\u2019s Doha Round\u2014would provide the \nbiggest benefits to individual Asian countries and the region as a whole. \nGiven existing proposals, detailed in Chapter 2, to create an FTA among \nASEAN+3 countries (the East Asia Free Trade Agreement\u2014EAFTA), the \nEAS (the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia\u2014CEPEA), \nand APEC members (the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific\u2014FTAAP), \nan  optimal  solution  would  be  to  adopt  a  sequential,  bottom\u2013up  \napproach from EAFTA to CEPEA and eventually to FTAAP, as well as a \npartnership with Europe (Kawai and Wignaraja 2008). \n104  On the \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d effect see also Baldwin (2009).\n105  In the EU, a region-wide free trade area culminated in a customs union regulated by the \nEC, with higher competence than national institutions (Chapter 5).\n228", "Policy Options\nHowever, since it may be near impossible for member countries \nto phase out existing agreements, an Asia-FTA could in practice turn \nout to be a series of linked agreements with variable membership \nand issue coverage. It would then be desirable to move quickly to \nestablish a customs union\u2014to extend the Asia-FTA by negotiating a \ncommon external tariff. This would obviate the need for complex and \nburdensome regulation of rules of origin. \nAs Asia creates a region-wide FTA and a customs union, it is \ntempting to imagine that this development might be accompanied by \na monetary union. Box 6.3 explains why recent experience, not least \nin Europe itself, counsels caution.\nAsian Monetary Fund. As the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis and its \naftermath have shown, Asia needs its own monetary fund to conduct \neffective  regional  macroeconomic  surveillance,  provide  prompt \nliquidity support to countries that experience financial crises, and \nformulate and monitor proper policy conditionality in order to ensure \nrepayment  and  the  restoration  of  macroeconomic  and  financial \nstability. Such an AMF could emerge by delinking the CMIM\u2019s lending \nfrom IMF programs once AMRO is properly staffed. With the requisite \nanalytical expertise and policy experience and proper governance \nstructures, AMRO could become a strong, professional AMF secretariat \nthat is capable of supporting the CMIM independently of the IMF and of \nnational political pressures. \nIf the CMIM is to be transformed into an AMF, the quality of \neconomic surveillance, currently conducted as part of ERPD under the \nASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 Process, needs to improve so that lending \nconditionality can be formulated independently of IMF programs. This, \nin turn, requires the establishment of a joint forum for finance ministers \nand central bank governors to intensify their policy dialogue (along the \nlines of the Asian Financial Stability Dialogue discussed below) and \nmove beyond information sharing to more rigorous peer review and \npeer pressure, and eventually due diligence.\nWhen AMRO becomes operational in May 2011, the rules for \nactivating CMIM lending should become clear. These should include \nthe possibility of precautionary lending without conditionality (along \nthe lines of the flexible credit line and precautionary credit line recently \nintroduced by the IMF for preventing financial crises in countries with \nvery strong fundamentals) and eschewing policy conditionality in the \nevent of external financial turbulence or panic.106 To move toward \n106  Such assistance would have provided great relief, for example, to the Republic of Korea \nduring the financial turbulence it experienced in the fall of 2008.\n229", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nBox 6.3.

In response to the 1997/98 \nand 2008/09 crises and the increased need for cooperation both \nwithin and across domestic financial systems, a new regional financial \narchitecture  is  taking  shape  through  multiple  layers  of  regional \narrangements and institutions. These aim to make the region more \nresilient to future crises, through improved regulation and supervision, \nand  better  capable  of  tackling  them  in  coordination  with  global \nagencies. They will also enable Asia to have a stronger voice in global \nforums commensurate with its growing economic importance.\nTo deepen regional financial cooperation and integration, ADB in \n2008 proposed the creation of an AFSD, a regional forum that would \nbring together all responsible authorities\u2014finance ministries, central \nbanks, financial supervisors and regulators, and representatives of \nthe private sector\u2014to address financial market vulnerabilities and \nregulations, promote financial market development, and introduce \ninitiatives for regional financial integration (ADB 2008b). The 2008/09 \nglobal economic and financial crisis underscored the importance of \nintroducing sound financial regulations and proper market governance. \nAn AFSD would complement and coordinate with other institutions \nsuch as AMRO that focus mainly on macroeconomic surveillance and \npolicies, as well as monitoring policy implementation. \nSeveral Asian developing economies need to continue liberalizing \ntheir domestic and cross-border regulation of financial services and \nfinancial flows. The AFSD could help national financial authorities \nstrengthen their domestic regulations and supervision. It could also \nhelp them coordinate their efforts to ensure financial stability through \ninformation exchange, the mutual recognition of market practices, \nand the harmonization of minimum supervisory rules. To maximize its \n107  Like the ones faced by Indonesia in the summer of 2005 (currency) and by Thailand toward \nthe end of 2006 (capital flows).\n231", "Institutions for Regional Integration\neffectiveness, it could be situated within an overarching intraregional \nIRI, such as ASEAN+3 or the EAS. As described in Section 6.3, on \nAsia-specific issues the AFSD would play a role similar to that of the \nFSB at a global level, while coordinating Asia\u2019s participation in the \nFSB and other global organizations such as the Bank for International \nSettlements (BIS). \nAsian  Legal  Advisory  Council.  Even  in  cases  where  Asian \ngovernments  want  to  see  international  obligations  implemented, \nnational administrative agencies or courts may not always be equipped \nto do so. This new institution\u2014composed of experts in international \ncommercial and business law\u2014would, at the request of national courts \nor administrative agencies, issue advisory opinions on a well-defined \nset of treaties and conventions that countries have ratified. Since no \nequivalent global institution exists, such an institutional innovation \ncould be created more quickly at the regional level.\nImportantly,  this  regional  advisory  council  would  leave  the \nresolution  of  disputes  to  national  courts.  This  arrangement  is \nappropriate,  since  disputes  often  involve  a  mixture  of  domestic \nand international legal issues that can be better assessed by local \ncourts\u2014and it would also alleviate sovereignty concerns. Specifically, \nALAC would not have a mandate to interpret domestic law or make \njudgments as to whether domestic law contradicts international legal \nobligations. This approach conforms to the approach to building IRIs \nknown as the \u201cASEAN way\u201d (Chapter 4).\nAn optional protocol could give any party to a dispute in that country \nthe right to refer a question about the appropriate interpretation of \ninternational law to ALAC. Ratifying such a protocol would thus signal \na commitment to the uniform application of international obligations. \nGovernments that had not signed the optional protocol might still \nrequest advisory opinions in certain circumstances. While this would \nnot indicate the same commitment, it could promote more uniform \ninterpretation. \nRegional  Public  Goods  Forums.  For  all  its  benefits,  Asia\u2019s \nincreasing interdependence has also increased its vulnerability to \nnegative externalities generated within or outside the region. Asian \ncountries have therefore become active participants in global and \nregional forums dealing with issues such as natural calamities, climate \nchange, and health concerns. Discussions on the provision of these \npublic goods at a regional level, however, still lack proper coordinating \nmechanisms. Initiatives usually emerge from individual countries, \nspecific interest groups, or existing global forums, but are scarcely \ncoordinated region-wide.\n232", "Policy Options\nAsia would benefit in particular from the creation of regional \npublic goods forums to tackle: \n  \u2022  environmental  issues\u2014not  only  climate  change,  but  also \nthe consequences of urban and industrial expansion and the \ndepletion of natural resources, such as air pollution, dust and \nsandstorms, marine and coastal management, and competition \namong countries over riverine resources;\n  \u2022  natural disasters\u2014such as tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, \nand  volcanic  eruptions\u2014through  early  warning  systems,  a \nregional disaster response system, and a high degree of donor \ncoordination; and\n  \u2022  communicable diseases\u2014the emergence and rapid spread \nof diseases such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and avian flu\u2014through \nregional  frameworks  and  coordinated  actions  among \nvulnerable  countries  as  well  as  between  developed  and \ndeveloping countries.\nOther pan-Asian public goods forums could seek to promote \nlow-carbon green growth, clean energy, and energy efficiency, which \nare  related  to  the  successful  implementation  of  climate  change \nadaptation and mitigation strategies, and control international crime \nand money laundering, which are becoming increasingly important \nproblems as the region improves its infrastructure and trade facilitation \nmechanisms. \nCouncil of Asian Economic Cooperation. Most ambitiously, Asia \ncould contemplate creating an umbrella organization governed at \nthe highest political level to address the wide range of pan-regional \nissues discussed above. Such a council could ensure that all Asian \ncountries are represented and have a voice in regional integration. It \ncould provide a mechanism for coordinating the various subregions\u2019 \ninitiatives. It could capture synergies and spillovers between economic \nand security cooperation. It would be a natural forum for addressing \npan-regional issues such as climate change and epidemics. It could \nalso be a vehicle through which Asian countries could represent their \ncommon positions in global venues and forums more effectively. For \nall these reasons, the creation of a CAEC would be an important step \ntoward an Asian economic community.\nThe CAEC would be a venue for those outside the core group of \nintegrating Asian economies to voice concerns about the potentially \ndiscriminatory effects of the measures adopted by the pioneers, and \nfor the pioneers to provide reassurance about the nondiscriminatory \nintent of their initiatives, through words and where necessary action. \nIt could also provide an antechamber for economies such as those of \n233", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nCentral and South Asia that are not yet part of \u201cFactory Asia\u201d but would \nbenefit from more connectivity with East Asia and its production \nnetworks.\nFor the CAEC to achieve its key objective of ensuring the broadest \npossible representation and voice, Asia needs to be defined inclusively. \nThis is the convoy model of membership described in Chapter 3. As \ndiscussed in Chapter 2, there exist several alternative definitions of \nAsia. An encompassing definition that subsumes Central, East, and \nSouth Asia plus the Pacific would be the most comprehensive. ADB\u2019s \nbroad membership shows how this is possible. Expanding ASEAN+3 \nto the EAS by including India, Australia, and New Zealand \u201cfor purposes \nof dialogue on broad strategic, political and economic issues\u201d108 is \nan important step in this direction. And the EAS should be seen as \na stepping-stone toward a much broader pan-Asian institution rather \nthan as an end point. \nIn its coordination role, the CAEC could provide a venue for \nagreeing key principles to be applied across subregional institutions, \nsuch as nondiscrimination and transparency. In the security area, \nit could prescribe that states adhere to the principles of ASEAN\u2019s \nTreaty of Amity and Cooperation. A standing pan-Asian institution \ncould also provide a venue for regular, structured interaction among \nsubregional IRIs.\nA pan-regional institution such as the CAEC could be a vehicle \nthrough which Asian countries could represent their common positions \nin multilateral institutions more effectively. For instance, it would be an \nappropriate place for developing common positions to be advanced \nin global forums such as the G20. A pan-regional grouping could also \npromote \u201cpan-Asian citizenry\u201d by facilitating the liberalization of air \ntransport, the free movement of persons via the adoption of simplified \nvisa rules, and student exchanges (which are particularly valuable for \nbuilding trust).109\nThis report has advocated the creation of a set of specialized pan-\nregional institutions, each with a specific mandate and concrete set \nof responsibilities: a PAIF, an Asia-FTA, an AMF, an AFSD, an ALAC, \nand several RPGFs.

With the entire set \nof issues on the table in a single forum, greater scope for mutually \nbeneficial agreements (cross-issue tradeoffs) would exist. Countries \nthat might resist agreements on political or security matters that are \na priority for their neighbors may, for example, be willing to sign on \nin return for an agreement on economic matters which they deem \nimportant. The costs of failing to cooperate in any area would be \nmagnified, insofar as this sours prospects for cooperating in other \nareas. In particular, deeper economic cooperation and integration \ntends to encourage cooperation on security matters, since conflict \n(and  the  associated  economic  disruption)  becomes  more  costly. \nIncorporating economic and security discussions within a single pan-\nAsian institution may thus promote cooperation. \nDifferent institutional designs would be best suited for achieving \none or more of the diverse aims of a pan-regional organization. A \nnetwork approach with limited agenda-setting and decision-making \npowers would be suitable for harmonizing subregional arrangements, \ncapturing positive spillovers between them, and averting conflicts. A \nmore hierarchical alternative, with the new pan-regional institution \nat the apex of the institutional pyramid, would be more suitable for \naddressing issues of pan-regional scope and representing Asia in \ninteractions with major powers outside the region. The history of Asian \nIRIs suggests that while any new pan-regional institution would start \nout being structured along relatively nonhierarchical lines, its structure \ncould evolve.\nPan-regional  facilitating  IRIs:  ADB  and  ESCAP.  ADB  and \nESCAP,  Asia\u2019s  only  two  pan-regional  facilitating  institutions,  play \ncrucial complementary roles in promoting regional cooperation and \nintegration. ADB contributes analysis and finance for the provision \nof  regional  public  goods,  notably  those  related  to  economic \ndevelopment and infrastructure, while ESCAP provides support for \ninfrastructure development and monitors countries\u2019 progress toward \nthe UN Millennium Development Goals. Both need to strengthen their \nfinancial and human resources devoted to regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI) activities and collaborate more closely on areas of \ncommon interest.\nAs a part of the formal UN system, ESCAP is particularly able to \ninvolve governments that wish to have a strong stake in the institution. A \nstrategy for strengthening ESCAP would capitalize on this comparative \nadvantage and address its lack of funding, enabling it to hire more \nexperts and prepare technical projects in specific areas of regional \ncooperation such as infrastructure development and trade facilitation. \n235", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nIndividual governments and international donors also ought to provide \nESCAP with the necessary resources to complete the Asian Highway \nand Trans-Asian Railway programs, which would boost economic \ndevelopment through better infrastructure and connectivity.

As financier, it provides loans and grants to support RCI projects. \nAs honest broker, it acts as a catalyst and coordinator for its member \ncountries and several regional forums. As knowledge provider, it \ncreates, consolidates, and disseminates knowledge and information \non RCI. And as capacity builder, it helps ADB member countries and \nsubregional and regional bodies build their institutional capacities to \nmanage RCI issues. \nADB has contributed to regional cooperation in several ways. It \nhas created subregional programs such as GMS, CAREC, and SASEC. It \nadopted an RCI strategy in 2006, and has prepared knowledge products \ncovering various RCI themes (including this report). In addition, its \nStrategy 2020, adopted in April 2008, identifies RCI as one of ADB\u2019s \ncore areas of operation and sets an important target of lending at least \n30% of its total loans to regional projects by the year 2020.\nHowever, ADB needs to devote even more human and financial \nresources to promoting RCI programs and projects to meet the growing \ndemand from the region, not least for knowledge products. Given the \nincreasing reputation ADB is gaining for its work on RCI, it is also well \npositioned to collaborate more closely with national and regional \nagencies in setting up new IRIs at the subregional, intraregional, and \npan-regional levels, for instance the PAIF.\n6.6. From Goals to Strategies\nGoals are one thing; strategies for achieving them are another. Since \nAsia\u2019s policy-making tends to be pragmatic and cautious, efforts to \nstrengthen its regional architecture should proceed in this mold. They \nwill succeed only if they respect Asia\u2019s distinctive styles and traditions. \nInstitutional  innovations  and  reforms  that  are  aimed  at  making \nmarkets work better and limited to specific initiatives and objectives \nare likely to fare best. Measures with a clear payoff are likely to garner \nmost support. Opinion leaders surveyed for this study are keenest on \ninstitutions promising tangible benefits such as trade, investment, \n236", "Policy Options\nand financial stability (Appendix 1). IRIs should be lean and carefully \nstructured to achieve their purpose. They should reach decisions by \nconsensus where necessary, and by more decisive means where \npossible: an approach consistent with Asian governments\u2019 attachment \nto their sovereignty. And since Asia is an economically very open region, \nefforts to strengthen its IRIs should seek to maximize cooperation and \ncomplementarities with global institutions.\nAt the same time, formulating a proper strategy to strengthen \nAsia\u2019s IRIs and move toward an Asian economic community requires \nstrong  commitment  from  political  leadership,  adequate  financial \nresources, and a knowledge community of scholars, business people, \ngovernment officials, and other parties with a shared commitment to \nAsian regionalism.\nPolitical leadership. Shaping a new institutional architecture in \nAsia and the Pacific will require effective high-level political leadership. \nTheory (see Chapter 3) and experience, in both Asia (Chapter 4) and \nother regions (Chapter 5), underscore the critical role that can be \nplayed by national leaders with a vision for strengthening a region\u2019s \ninstitutional architecture and the power and energy to advance that \nagenda. In Europe, this high-level leadership has historically come \nfrom French and German leaders, working together in an effort to \npreserve a balance of power within the region\u2014whether Helmut \nSchmidt and Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing in the 1970s or Helmut Kohl \nand Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in the 1990s. Politicians from other European \ncountries have also played a key leadership role at important junctures \nin the European integration process. In both cases, bold and visionary \nleadership has been vital.\nAsian leaders have set out their visions of an Asian community that \ncould engage in dialogue, cooperation, and action on economic and \npolitical matters and face future challenges collectively. These include \nthe idea of an \u201cAsia-Pacific Community\u201d from former Australian Prime \nMinister Kevin Rudd, the call by then Japanese Prime Minister Yukio \nHatoyama to create an \u201cEast Asian Community,\u201d Republic of Korea \nPresident  Lee  Myung-bak\u2019s  idea  of  a  \u201cNew  Asia  Initiative,\u201d  PRC \nPresident Hu Jintao\u2019s promotion of a \u201cHarmonious Asia,\u201d and Indian \nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s commitment to build an Asian \neconomic community. \nWe are witnessing a growing commitment from the region\u2019s \nleaders toward a more integrated Asia. But while momentum toward \npan-Asian regionalism is building, there is also awareness that the \ninstitutional capacity to support these ideas remains constrained. \nThese  proposals  by  political  leaders  acknowledge  the  challenge \n237", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nof converting political vision into the process of institution building, \nespecially by empowering Asia\u2019s IRIs to enable them to be more \neffective in delivering their mandates. There is increasing recognition \nof the fact that declarations on strengthening regional integration at \nsummits and official meetings need to be translated into activities \nand programs. Asia\u2019s political leaders have also started paying more \nattention  to  the  importance  of  translating  official  statements  on \nregionalism into popular sentiments and bringing its discourse from \nthe current experts\u2019 and technocrats\u2019 level to that of laypersons.110\nGiven  the  region\u2019s  diversity,  building  Asian  regionalism  will \nrequire collective leadership that achieves an adequate balance of \npower among the participants. Unless all participants feel they have \na proper role that recognizes their collective ownership and shared \nleadership, it will be difficult to fulfill the visions laid out by Asia\u2019s \nleaders. Established powers such as Japan, emerging ones such as \nthe PRC and India, and middling ones such as the Republic of Korea, \nwhich seeks to act as an intermediary between the PRC and Japan, \nASEAN, which aims to create an AEC by 2015 and will undoubtedly \ncontinue to lead by example, and Australia all have an important role \nin building institutions to integrate Asia. In other words, the shared \nleadership of established, emerging, and middling powers will provide \nthe backbone for building an economic community in Asia.\nFinancial  resources.  Any  proposal  for  reforming  existing \ninstitutions or creating new ones must weigh the benefits against the \ncosts\u2014not least, the financial expense of staffing an organization, \nhousing it, and administering its operations. The cost of expanding \nexisting organizations and arrangements can be estimated relatively \nwell by scaling up their current budgets. But estimating the cost of \ncreating new institutions designed to serve the long-term vision of \nforming an Asian economic community is inevitably more speculative. \nThere can be no definite answer, since it depends on a host of factors, \nnot least what the organization would be expected to do and how \neffective member governments would want it to be. \nOne starting point is to extrapolate from the costs associated with \nexisting IRIs. These vary widely. APEC\u2019s small secretariat in Singapore \ngets by on a shoestring. Headed by an executive director working with \na small team of program directors seconded from APEC member \neconomies, it has an annual operating budget of around $3 million \n110  One recent example of these is the speech given by India\u2019s Prime Minister Manmohan \nSingh at the 16th SAARC Summit on 28 April 2010 in Thimphu, Bhutan (http://pmindia.nic \n.in/speeches.htm).\n238", "Policy Options\n(Japan MOFA 2006; Gnygell and Cook 2005). Its tiny budget reflects \nAPEC\u2019s informal, decentralized, lightly institutionalized nature. That \nsaid, APEC leaders have agreed to help strengthen the secretariat by \nincreasing member contributions by 30% from 2009.111\nASEAN\u2019s secretariat also has a very small operating budget of \naround $10 million a year, limited by its funding formula of equal \ncontribution from member countries.112 Due to its limited budget, the \nASEAN secretariat is understaffed and under-resourced, with poorly \npaid positions and related problems in attracting top-caliber staff. \nAs a consequence, the secretariat frequently requests financial and \ntechnical support from bilateral and multilateral donors for capacity \nbuilding. \nASEAN+3 does not have a formal secretariat: its rotating chair is \nin charge of organizing its agenda and various meetings (Chapter 4). \nBut AMRO, its new regional surveillance unit, will have an estimated \nbudget of $3 million for its first three years of operation,113 with 80% \nsplit equally among  the Plus Three countries and 20% split equally \namong ASEAN countries.114 \nAs a multilateral development organization that facilitates regional \ncooperation initiatives, ADB\u2019s size and its staff\u2019s skillset may provide \na good approximation of the type of mid-sized institution that might \ninitially be required to create a secretariat for an Asian economic \ncommunity. In 2010, ADB employed around 900 professional staff plus \naround 2,500 national officers and administrative staff. ADB\u2019s operating \nbudget of some $400 million115 provides an order of magnitude of the \npotential cost of institution building in Asia.116 \nEventually, a broad and deep regional community might require a \nsecretariat along the lines of the EC. This has an operating budget of \nalmost $3 billion annually, most of which is absorbed by staff salaries. \n111  Funding for APEC operations comes from member countries alone. Members\u2019 contributions \nto APEC\u2019s secretariat are related to the size of their GDP.\n112  In addition to ASEAN\u2019s operating budget, the secretariat manages ASEAN\u2019s various trust \nfunds\u2014amounting to around $300 million in 2008\u2014which are financed by ASEAN\u2019s \ndialogue partners and other donors.\n113  This initial budget may have to rise once AMRO reaches the full complement of staff \nneeded to fulfill all its functions.\n114  In other words, the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea will contribute 26.7% each to \nAMRO\u2019s budget, while contributions from each of the 10 ASEAN countries will be 2%.\n115  This figure does not include consultants\u2019 remuneration, which in 2010 was in the order of \n$25 million.\n116  Staff salaries make up a large part of these running costs, or approximately 35% of the \ntotal (of which 25% is for professional staff). Administrative expenses\u2014communications, \noffice occupancy and supplies, and equipment maintenance and support\u2014represent \napproximately 16.5% of the total, while business travel and representation expenses make \nup around 6% of the total.\n239", "Institutions for Regional Integration\nThis is only a small fraction of the EU\u2019s total budget, which in 2010 was \naround \u20ac141.5 billion ($195 billion).117\nKnowledge  community.  Impetus  for  regional  integration  can \nalso  come  from  the  region\u2019s  think-tanks,  universities,  business \npeople, professionals, journalists, political and economic analysts, \nand other members of civil society. Many welcome the formation of \nan Asian identity and increasingly interact with regional colleagues \nthrough professional, educational, and official networks. Their closer \nrelationships and collaboration can inform regional strategies and \nprovide foundations for strengthening Asia\u2019s IRIs.\nSuch  pan-regional  networks  serve  as  mechanisms  for \ncommunication,  socialization,  and  information  sharing.  Business \norganizations ought to develop links similar to those that increasingly \nexist among academics and researchers. Existing and new IRIs can \nfacilitate this networking by encouraging greater participation in their \naffairs by civil society members who support the goals of regional \nintegration. \nRegional integration and cooperation are knowledge-intensive \nprocesses, requiring careful policy analysis. The region\u2019s think-tanks \nand universities are ideally structured to conduct research and offer \nadvice: they can focus on issues in depth and over time. They are \nwell positioned to guide integration, provided they work closely with \ngovernments to ensure that their research addresses timely questions \nand receives high-level attention (ADB 2008b). \nMost Asian countries have significant capabilities in their major \nresearch institutes, at least one of which in each country is typically \nfocused  on  international  economic  issues.  These  institutes  have \nbegun to organize through regional networks\u2014such as the Asian \nPolicy Forum, the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research, and the \nNetwork of East Asian Think-Tanks\u2014to share ideas and research. Asia \nis also home to many of the world\u2019s leading research universities. \nThey too are joining regional networks, such as the Association of \nEast Asian Research Universities and the ASEAN University Network. \nTheir faculties and students represent exceptional assets for analyzing \nand  debating  regionalism.  Programs  that  involve  leading  centers \nof learning can bring powerful intellectual resources to bear on the \nsubject of regionalism, and help mobilize future leaders for the long-\nterm project of building a regional community. The University of the \nSouth Pacific, for instance, was established more than 40 years ago \n117  Using a euro\u2013dollar exchange rate of 1.375 as on 16 March 2010.\n240", "Policy Options\nto promote higher learning in the Pacific region. More recently, the \nSouth Asia University was set up to promote the idea of regionalism \nand facilitate people-to-people exchange in South Asia, sponsored by \nSAARC member states. The research group established by ASEAN+3 to \nanalyze regional cooperation issues among its 13 members, especially \nin macroeconomics and finance, is also helping to advance the idea of \na knowledge community in Asia. \nAll of these efforts have a purpose: to work toward the vision of \nan Asian economic community characterized by deeply integrated \nmarkets in goods and services, deep and liquid regional financial \nmarkets more resilient to financial crises, more closely coordinated \nmonetary  and  fiscal  policies  that  enhance  macroeconomic  and \nexchange-rate stability and facilitate global rebalancing, and lower \nlevels of poverty and income disparity. Ultimately, it is about building \na more integrated Asia, free of poverty and conflict, prosperous and \nconfident, and well equipped to shape its destiny\u2014and that of the \nworld\u2014for the better. \n241", "References \nAbe, Shigeyuki. 2009.

They feel that while cooperation on \ntrade and finance is progressing, more needs to be done to provide \neconomic infrastructure and regional public goods in areas such as \nthe environment, health, and regional security. They believe that Asia \nneeds to strengthen its institutions for regional integration in order to \npromote closer cooperation and deeper economic integration. They \nare keener on strengthening and consolidating existing institutions than \non creating new ones. They also provide specific recommendations on \nhow to move towards an Asian economic community in the long run. \nThe survey was conducted between 21 January and 12 February \n2010, using a stratified sample of 3,027 opinion leaders from 19 countries \nin Asia and the Pacific.1 The country distribution was based on a weighted \naverage of the size of its population and its gross domestic product. \n1   In order to increase the likelihood of response, the survey questionnaire was designed to take \nno more than 10\u201315 minutes. Questions were formulated in a simple way, with background \ninformation provided where necessary. The English questionnaire was translated into six \nlanguages (Bahasa Indonesia, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Russian, and Vietnamese) to \nfacilitate understanding from a broad spectrum of respondents. Interviews were conducted \nonline with the help of TNS Global Market Research, a well-known surveying firm; once \n1,000 responses had been collected, the survey was closed. A complete discussion of results \nof the survey is included in Capannelli (2010).\n262", "Perception Survey of Opinion Leaders in Asia: Summary\nThe sample was organized into five subregions and four categories, as \nshown in Table A1.1. Around 77% of the 1,000 respondents are based \nin East Asia (i.e., either Southeast or Northeast Asia), followed by South \nAsia (16.8%), the Pacific and Oceania (3.8%), and Central Asia (2.4%). \nBusiness leaders account for 40% of respondents and government \nofficials for 34%, followed by academics (18%) and opinion leaders \nfrom the media and nongovernment organizations (8%).\nTable A1.1.

They think regional integration is positive for Asian \neconomies as it speeds up their development and could give Asia a \nmore coordinated and stronger voice in international forums. As well \nas offering an alternative to global multilateral institutions, regional \nintegration is perceived as helping to reduce poverty and improve \nsocial indicators (Figure A1.1).\nFigure A1.1. Costs and Benefits of Regional Economic Integration\n0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00\nCosts Greater divide between rich and poor \nLoss of independence of national economic policies \nWeaker economic linkages with non-Asian countries\nLoss of national culture and identity \nBenefits Faster and more dynamic economic growth \nStronger Asian voice in international forums \nAlternative to global multilateral institutions \nLess poverty, better social indicators \nNote: Values are based on total response (1,000). The question was: Rate the costs and \nbenefits for your country of strengthening economic relations with other countries in Asia and \nthe Pacific.\nSource: ADB (2010).\nAmong the costs associated with regionalism, Asian opinion leaders \nare most concerned about a potential widening of the divide between \nthe rich and the poor. This may happen because the opportunity of \nbenefiting from stronger regional economic ties is unevenly distributed \nwithin countries, but it can be mitigated by regional measures, such as \nimproving infrastructure.\nOther  perceived  costs  of  regionalism  include  a  loss  of \nindependence  over  national  economic  policies  and  an  erosion \nof competitive advantages over neighboring countries as national \nstandards are harmonized or mutually recognized.2 Closer regional \nintegration  might  also  weaken  the  region\u2019s  economic  links  with \nnon-Asian countries, respondents fear, and erode national culture \n2  In Figure A1.2 these two costs are listed together.\n264", "Perception Survey of Opinion Leaders in Asia: Summary\nand identity. Overall, though, opinion leaders believe the benefits of \nregional economic integration far outweigh the costs.\nAsia\u2019s  opinion  leaders  believe  that  infrastructure  projects  to \nimprove  connectivity  and  establish  energy  links  offer  the  biggest \nbenefits, followed by the creation of a region-wide free trade and \ninvestment  area.  Regional  dialogues  on  macroeconomic  policy, \nfinancial sector development, the provision of regional public goods, \nand security issues are also listed as highly beneficial, followed by \nmechanisms  to  coordinate  monetary  and  exchange-rate  policies. \nFigure A1.2 lists such functional areas in order of importance, as \nsuggested by opinion leaders. These findings are consistent with \nthe results of the 2007 ADB survey. While the 2010 survey included a \nwider range of opinion leaders from a broader range of countries, their \nfindings are remarkably similar.3 \nFigure A1.2.

A \nbroad consensus agrees that existing regional institutions should be \nstrengthened\u2014by national agencies delegating more powers to them, \nincreasing their financial resources, and improving their governance\u2014\nand streamlined by consolidating existing arrangements into region-\nwide ones, defining a clearer division of labor among similar institutions, \nand eliminating unnecessary functional duplications. Around half of \nopinion leaders believe that new IRIs should be created where gaps \nexist or where existing institutions are inefficient or ineffective. Two \nareas where new institutions are deemed to be urgently needed are \nfor the provision of regional public goods and the development of \nregional infrastructure.\nMore than four in five respondents suggested creating an Asian \neconomic community as the long-term objective of regional integration. \nFigure A1.3.

Enhancing \ndialogue to coordinate macroeconomic and financial policies is also \npopular across subregions. Enhancing the dialogue on monetary and \nexchange-rate policy and the creation of a regional security zone were \nhigh in the list of preferences (Figure A1.4). Creating a monetary or \na political union received considerably less support. Around 30% of \nrespondents felt a political union was undesirable or highly so, while \n35% were neutral.\nFigure A1.4.

Opinion leaders from Central Asia and the \nPacific consider creating an economic community a low priority. In \nCentral Asia they were more interested in establishing a security zone, \nwhile in the Pacific the priority is a free trade and investment area. \n267", "Appendix 1\nThe  realization  of  these  long-term  objectives  requires  the \nenhancement of existing institutions and the creation of new ones. \nAs Figure A1.5 shows, opinion leaders believe that the following \nIRIs need to be created (in descending order of priority): a financial \nstability dialogue; a region-wide free trade and investment area; an \nAsian monetary fund; a pan-Asian infrastructure forum; and an Asian \nsecretariat for economic cooperation.4 \nFigure A1.5.

They believe that it is a pressing priority \nthat the ASEAN, SAARC, and Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) secretariats \nimprove their governing principles and decision-making structures, \nincrease their financial and human resources, receive a much stronger \nmandate  and  delegated  powers  from  their  national  stakeholder \nagencies, and reach out more actively out to the global community \nby strengthening relations with non-members (Figure A1.6).
