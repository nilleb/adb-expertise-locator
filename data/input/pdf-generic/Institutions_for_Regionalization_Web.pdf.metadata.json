Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. \nDespite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: \n1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than \n$1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. \n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\nISBN\nPublication Stock No. BKK090359\n\n978-92-9092-210-0\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nI\n\n \n\nN\nS\nT\nI\nT\nU\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\nF\nO\nR\nR\nE\nG\nO\nN\nA\nL\n\nI\n\n \n\n \nI\n\nN\nT\nE\nG\nR\nA\nT\nI\nO\nN\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nT\no\nw\na\nr\nd\na\nn\nA\ns\ni\na\nn\nE\nc\no\nn\no\nm\ni\nc\n \nC\no\nm\nm\nu\nn\ni\nt\ny\n\n\fINSTITUTIONS FOR \nREGIONAL INTEGRATION\nToward an Asian Economic Community\n\n\f\u00a9 2010 Asian Development Bank\n\nAll rights reserved.

integrating  them,  and  establishment  of \nvast  linkages  with  the  global  economy  are  some  of  the \ngreatest  accomplishments  of  the  past  few  decades. \nMarket-led  integration,  backed  by  national  efforts  and \nregional collective actions, has brought shared prosperity to Asia and \nthe Pacific.\nAsian \n\nis  gaining  momentum  through  enhanced \ncooperation  between  governments,  firms,  and  people.  Today,  the \nregion\u2019s  rapid  growth  is  marked  by  growing  cross-border  trade, \nfinancial  flows,  and  movement  of  people.  The  region  is  integrating \nwithin itself and with the rest of the world. But the road ahead is long \nand full of challenges.\n\nintegration \n\nAsia\u2019s approach has been pragmatic and flexible. It has followed \na bottom\u2013up process that supports subregional cooperation initiatives \nthrough a multitrack and multispeed approach, reflecting the diversity \nand heterogeneity of preferences in the region. This approach, which \nhas  been  sometimes  described  as  \u201cgradual,\u201d  has  allowed  both \ndeveloping  and  developed  economies  to  participate  in  building  a \nbroader and unified regional architecture.\n\nAsian  integration  is  supported  by  a  dense  web  of  overlapping \nregional and subregional institutions that are largely intergovernmental \nand  focus  on  specific  functional  goals.  The  great  diversity  of  Asian \neconomies and societies poses challenges to the creation of regional \nstructures. Coupled with this is a reluctance to delegate authority to \nregional institutions.\n\nSome recent efforts to institutionalize policy cooperation have been \nsuccessful and must be lauded. The multilateralization of the Chiang \nMai Initiative, the setting up of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research \nOffice, and efforts to create a region-wide free trade area are concrete \nfirst steps to institutionalize Asia\u2019s policy cooperation initiatives.\n\nxii\n\n\fSo far, the existing institutions and arrangements have served the \nregion  well.  But  the  progress  of  regionalism  has  remained  uneven \nacross  subregions  and  thematic  sectors.  By  most  measures,  East \nAsia  is  more  extensively  integrated  than  South  Asia,  Central  Asia,  or \nthe  Pacific.  As  a  result,  across  the  region  there  is  serious  rethinking \nand  discussion  on  the  institutional  framework  needed  to  lock  in \nthe  realized  gains  and  support  the  next  steps  for  enhanced  regional \ncooperation and integration.\n\nDo we need to create new institutions, strengthen existing ones, \nor even look at consolidation? What will be the governance structure \nof Asian institutions? Are we ready to create an Asia-wide institution \nand  delegate  some  degree  of  sovereignty  to  it?  What  has  been  the \nexperience of other regions? What is the way forward?\n\nThis work is an attempt to answer these questions. It is the last in \na trilogy of studies undertaken jointly by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  and  the  ADB  Institute  analyzing  the  progress  of  integration  to \nachieve  our  vision  of  an  \u201cAsian  economic  community.\u201d  This  will  not \nhappen  overnight.  Visions  and  dreams  are  realized  by  taking  small, \nincremental steps. Thus the longer it takes, the sooner we must start.\n\nOur  first  study,  Emerging  Asian  Regionalism\u2014A  Partnership  for \nShared Prosperity (ADB 2008b), identified strengthening the institutional \nbase  for  Asian  integration  and  enhancing  regional  connectivity  to \nboost  production  networks  and  trade  as  the  next  steps  for  creating \na  stronger  architecture  for  regional  policy  cooperation.  The  second \nstudy, Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia (ADB/ADBI 2009), looked in \ndepth at building physical infrastructure networks and institutions to \nsupport the region\u2019s rapid growth.\n\nThis  third  study looks  at the  institutional framework for regional \ncooperation and integration. It analyzes why, despite a dense network \nof  arrangements  and  institutions,  Asia  remains  \u201cinstitution  light\u201d\u2014\nmarked by few formal or explicit commitments from member countries \nin terms of an agenda for cooperation. It lays out the general principles \nand  options  to  strengthen  the  region\u2019s  institutional  architecture  to \nachieve the goal of an Asian economic community.\n\nI  wish  to  express  deep  appreciation  to  the  excellent  team  of \nindividuals,  both  inside  and  outside  ADB  and  its  Institute,  who \ncontributed  to  preparing  this  study.  It  is  the  joint  work  of  several \nexperts  who  served  as  authors,  advisers,  reviewers,  editors,  and \ntechnical staff. Jong-Wha Lee, Srinivasa Madhur, Giovanni Capannelli, \nand Sabyasachi Mitra developed the study concept and implemented \nthe  project.  A  team  of  consultants  led  by  Barry  Eichengreen  and \nincluding Miles Khaler, Andrew MacIntyre, See Seng Tan, the late Hadi \n\nForeword \n\nxiii\n\n\fSoesastro, and 30 background paper authors provided valuable ideas \ncombined with theoretical and analytical inputs in preparing the study. \nPhilippe  Legrain  served  as  the  economics  editor.  Masahiro  Kawai \nand  Rajat  M.  Nag  provided  overall  guidance  and  strategic  direction \nto the study.\n\nThe emergence of Asian regionalism is a powerful historical force \nthat will help build peace and prosperity within and outside the region. \nBuilding the  right institutional framework  for  Asian integration  is not \nonly  important  for  the  region  to  eradicate  poverty  and  sustain  the \ngrowth momentum, but it is also good for the rest of the world as Asia \nincreases its contribution to the global economy.\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\n\nForeword \n\nxiv\n\n\fAcknowledgments \n\nT his study draws inspiration from ADB President Haruhiko \n\nKuroda\u2019s vision of a truly integrated and globally connected \nAsia. It was conceptualized and implemented by a team \nof ADB staff and international consultants.

This \nemerging  Asian  regionalism  offers  a  new  platform  for  economic \ndevelopment that is, as the predecessor to this report, Emerging Asian \nRegionalism: A Partnership for Shared Prosperity (ADB 2008b), put it, \n\u201cgood for individual economies, good for Asia, and good for the world.\u201d\nThis  remarkable  achievement  now  needs  entrenching  and \nextending\u2014as  is  already  starting  to  happen.  Interdependence  is \ndeepening.  Cross-border  trade  in  parts  and  components  continues \nto  rise,  as  economies  such  as  Viet  Nam\u2014like  the  People\u2019s  Republic \nof  China  (PRC)  before  them\u2014develop  manufacturing  assembly \noperations  and  connect  up  with  regional  supply  chains.  This \nintraregional trade in intermediate goods is increasingly supplemented \nby trade in final goods too, as consumption growth accelerates. Foreign \ndirect investment flows within Asia are also rising fast. \n\n1  The geographical coverage of this study is defined by ADB\u2019s regional membership, which \nincludes 48 countries that are part of the \u201cAsia and the Pacific\u201d region. The complete list of \ncountries covered in this study is shown in Table 2.1 in Chapter 2. Countries are grouped \ninto five subregions: Central Asia, South Asia, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the \nPacific, including Oceania. It is often helpful to consider Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia \ntogether as East Asia.\n\n2\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\nThese  developments  are  mostly  a  result  of  market  forces  allied \nwith  liberalizing  national  policies.  As  governments  have  opened  up \nnational  economies,  abundant  supplies  of  low-skilled  labor  in  some \ncountries have combined with highly skilled labor and manufacturing \ncapabilities in others to stimulate trade and investment. Falling transport \nand communication costs have deepened these intraregional links.\n\nAsia\u2019s integration is thus more a spontaneous outcome of national \npolicy initiatives and technical change than the result of a grand scheme \nto  create  a  single  market  for  the  region.  While  \u201ctop\u2013down\u201d  policy \ncooperation on trade, investment, finance, and other issues has been \nimportant, Asia\u2019s integration has mostly come from the bottom up. \n\nThe  vigor  of  this  largely  organic\u2014and  visibly  positive\u2014process \n\nnow creates four challenges for policy-makers.\n\n\u2022  Cementing  recent  gains.  Although  Asia\u2019s  economic  growth \nhas  been  very  rapid,  recent  achievements  are  fragile.  The \nregion\u2019s beneficial openness to  the  rest of the world also has \nits downsides, not least a vulnerability to external shocks. The \ncollapse of trade and financial flows in the 2008/09 crisis was \na reminder of this. While Asian governments did not succumb \nto  the  temptation  to  restrict  trade  and  investment,  the  crisis \nunderscores  the  need  to  buttress  economic  and  financial \nstability  to  consolidate  recent  gains.  Moreover,  while  regional \neconomic cooperation has progressed in recent years, existing \nobligations  and  commitments  have  yet  to  be  implemented \nuniformly across Asia and the Pacific. \n\n\u2022  Broadening the process. Until now, Asian economic integration \nhas mostly focused on East Asia: \u201cFactory Asia\u201d is primarily an \nEast Asian operation. While trade between South and East Asia\u2014\nnotably  between  India  and  the  PRC\u2014is  growing,  not  all  parts \nof  those  regions,  and  not  all  sectors  and  activities,  are  equally \ninvolved. Whereas almost 60% of East Asia\u2019s trade in parts and \ncomponents  takes  place  within  the  region,  intraregional  trade \nshares are very low in Central and South Asia, and in the Pacific. \nSince intraregional trade\u2014in intermediate goods in particular\u2014\ncan be an important driver of growth, its benefits now need to be \nextended throughout those three subregions.\n\n\u2022  Deepening integration. The next steps in regional integration \ninvolve moving from integrated trade and production networks \nto more deeply integrated goods markets by lifting behind-the-\nborder barriers to trade and competition; removing obstacles \nto interregional trade in services; allowing a freer movement \nof  labor,  especially  skilled  labor,  across  regional  members; \n\n3\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\ndeveloping  deeper,  wider,  and  more  crisis-resilient  financial \nmarkets  in  Asia  that  are  able  to  allocate  the  region\u2019s  vast \n(often externally invested) savings more efficiently to its huge \ninvestment  needs  and  thus  facilitate  global  rebalancing;  and \ncoordinating monetary and fiscal policies more closely in order \nto enhance macroeconomic and exchange-rate stability. Last \nbut not least, they involve reducing poverty, shrinking income \ndisparities,  and  boosting  investment  and  growth  in  the  less \ndynamic economies across Asia and the Pacific. The end result \nwould  be  the  creation  of  an  \u201cAsian  economic  community,\u201d \ncomplete with a new regional architecture that would include \nfully integrated markets and stronger regional institutions.\n\n\u2022  Ensuring the compatibility of regional and global integration. \nAsia,  especially  East  Asia,  is  the  paradigmatic  open  region, \nand its approach to cooperation is one of \u201copen regionalism\u201d \n(Garnaut 1996). Since Asia is highly integrated globally as well \nas regionally, it is crucial that measures to cement the region\u2019s \nintegration  complement  rather  than  jeopardize  its  links  with \nthe rest of the world.\n\n1.1. Need for Institutions\n\nThe premise of this study is that these four challenges cannot be met by \nrelying on market processes and national action alone\u2014Asian countries \nwill  also  have  to  work  together  effectively.  That  demands  norms, \nrules,  and  understandings  about  how  to  proceed,  as  well  as  regional \norganizations to coordinate governments\u2019 actions. In short, it requires \ninstitutions for regional integration (IRIs), which are defined in Box 1.1.\n\nAsia and the Pacific hardly lack IRIs\u2014this study counts a total of 40. \nBut while the region possesses a dense web of such institutions, these \nvary enormously in scope and structure, since\u2014like Asian integration \nitself\u2014they  have  developed  in  response  to  specific  needs  rather \nthan by grand design. Some are overarching organizations: umbrella \narrangements with comprehensive purviews, which convene summits \nfor  heads  of  government  or  state  and/or  ministerial-level  meetings, \nand provide the normative and declaratory frameworks that legitimize \nand  support  regional  cooperation  and  integration  initiatives.  Others \nare functional institutions: specialized organizations with a narrower, \noften  technical,  agenda  that  focus  on  a  specific  area  (or  range  of \nareas)  of  cooperation  and/or  promote  cooperation  within  a  limited \n\n4\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\nBox 1.1. Defining Institutions for Regional Integration\n\nInstitutions  can  be  defined  in  several  ways. \n\nIn  the  broadest  sense,  academics  conceive \nof  institutions  as  durable  rules  that  shape \nexpectations, interests, and behavior. These range \nfrom  formal  obligations  to  informal  norms  and \nunderstandings  of  what  constitutes  acceptable \nbehavior. This study uses a more focused definition \nwhich is arguably more in keeping with everyday \nusage. It defines institutions as arrangements and \norganizations,  ranging  from  ad hoc  and  informal \nforums that lack an organizational core to formal \nstanding bodies that serve a particular purpose. \n\ninvolved \n\nThe  focus  of  this  study  is  on  institutions  for \nregional  integration  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific\u2014\norganizations \nin  regional  economic \nintegration and cooperation, whose mandate may \nalso  extend  to  non-economic  issues.  Typically, \nthe  principals  or  contracting  parties  of  these \ninstitutions  are  national  governments,  although \nother \nnongovernmental \nnonstate actors may also participate in their work \nand help shape their agenda.\n\norganizations \n\nand \n\ngeographical area. There are also facilitating IRIs: institutions that have \ndeveloped programs and initiatives to bolster regional integration by \nproviding advisory, administrative, technical, and financial support.\n\nThe geographical scope of Asia\u2019s IRIs is diverse. Subregional ones \ninclude  IRIs  that  focus  on  limited  geographical  areas\u2014such  as  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program, the Coral \nTriangle  Initiative,  and  the  Greater  Tumen  Initiative\u2014and  others  that \nbring together larger subregions, such as the South Asian Association \nfor  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC),  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  (PIF), \nand the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Intraregional \nIRIs connect countries from two or more Asian subregions: examples \ninclude the East Asia Summit (EAS),2 ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN+3), \nand  the  Network  of  Asian  River  Basin  Organization  (NARBO).  Two \nIRIs have a pan-Asian remit: the United Nations (UN) Economic and \nSocial  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (ESCAP)  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  Finally,  transregional  IRIs\u2014such  as  the \nAsia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM),  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \n(APEC), and the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEc)\u2014connect \nAsia and the Pacific with the rest of the world. The inventory of IRIs \nanalyzed in this study is shown in Table 1.1 and discussed in greater \ndetail in Chapter 4. \n\n2  The United States and the Russian Federation will join as members of EAS starting 2011.\n\n5\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nTable 1.1.

Existing IRIs may need to be made more \neffective, and in some cases new institutions may be required. At the \nsame time, national agencies may need to increase the powers they \ndelegate  to  regional  institutions.  However,  Asian  countries  may  not \nbe  ready  to  surrender  parts  of  their  national  sovereignty  to  regional \nbodies.  This  raises  several  important  questions.  What  is  the  benefit \nto Asian countries of participating in subregional, regional, and global \ninstitutions? Will Asia be willing to create more pan-regional institutions, \na regional bureaucracy, and strong secretariats in key IRIs? What type \nof governance structure would these institutions need to adopt? Which \n\n7\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nspecific reforms and innovations on issues such as membership criteria, \ndecision-making rules, and budget contributions should they consider?\nThe great diversity among Asian economies and societies creates \nanother set of challenges for the establishment of common regional \nstructures. But recurrent crises affecting the region, from those of the \npast  decades  to  the  recent  global  economic  and  financial  turmoil, \nunderscore  the  importance  of  enhancing  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration. Asian authorities are becoming increasingly aware of the \nbenefits  of  closer  dialogue,  cooperation,  and  coordination  among \nregional  members.  Stronger  IRIs  may  be  needed  to  enable  Asia\u2019s \nvoice to emerge more strongly in global institutions and forums such \nas the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20. However, is the \ncurrent political environment conducive for strengthening Asia\u2019s IRIs? \nIs there enough commitment from Asian political leaders to increase \nregional cooperation and integration? Are relevant private sector and \ncivil  society  organizations  aware  of  the  issues  and  involved  in  the \nactivities of Asia\u2019s IRIs?\n\nClaims  that  Asian  economic  integration  is  a  relatively  new \nphenomenon and cooperation is lightly institutionalized (ADB 2008b) \nare  grounded  in  implicit  or  explicit  comparisons  with  other  regions \nand their histories of economic cooperation. The most familiar is the \ncontrast  between  Europe,  with  its  panoply  of  longstanding  formal \ninstitutions, and Asia, which has self-consciously rejected the European \nmodel  in  favor  of  a  more  consensual  and  informal  path  toward \ncollaboration.  Other  regions\u2014such  as  the  Americas,  Africa,  and  the \nMiddle East\u2014may provide an equally useful standard of comparison, \ngiven the proliferation of their regional economic institutions in recent \ndecades, offering both positive and negative lessons. This in turn raises \nanother  set  of  important  questions.  How  does  the  extent  to  which \ncooperation is institutionalized vary across issue areas in Asia? What \nare the implications for efforts to cooperate within the region? Where \nthere are contrasts with other parts of the world, what explains them? \nAre there lessons that Asia could learn from Europe and other regions? \nAnd what are the likely prospects for further institutionalization moving \ntoward the creation of a regional community?\n\nThis  study  attempts  to  answer  these  questions.  It  is  structured \nas  follows.  The  remainder  of  Chapter  1  analyzes  Asia\u2019s  complex \ninstitutional  architecture  and  discusses  different  approaches  to \nregional institution building. Chapter 2 reviews the progress of Asian \neconomic  integration  and  cooperation.  It  describes  the  contours  of \nintegration, contrasting the progress made in production and trade in \nfinal  goods  with  that  in  the  services,  monetary,  and  finance  sectors, \nlikewise  comparing  the  progress  made  in  East  Asia  with  that  in \n\n8\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\nSouth Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific. It also reviews the progress of \nintegration and cooperation in infrastructure and regional public goods. \nChapter 3 reviews the analytical literature on the determinants of\u2014and \ndeterrents  to\u2014further  institutionalization,  introducing  the  analytical \nconcepts  used  in  the  social  science  literature  to  analyze  regional \ninstitutions. Chapter 4 puts these concepts to work by describing the \ninstitutional landscape in Asia and the Pacific. It provides an overview \nof  existing  regional  economic  cooperation  arrangements  and  the \nextent of their institutionalization along different dimensions. Chapter 5 \nplaces institution building in a comparative context, highlighting Asia\u2019s \neconomic  and  political  heterogeneity,  openness  to  the  rest  of  the \nworld, distinctive history, and unique security setting. It develops the \ncontrast  with  the  experience  of  other  regions  such  as  Europe,  Latin \nAmerica, Africa, and the Middle East, offering some important lessons \nfor  Asia.  Finally,  Chapter  6  elaborates  proposals  for  strengthening \nthe  regional architecture, with the  goal  of  cementing past gains and \npropelling the region forward to deeper integration. It includes a set of \npolicy recommendations for reforming Asia\u2019s institutional architecture \ntoward the creation of an Asian economic community.\n\n1.2. Asia\u2019s Institutional Architecture \n\nAs  Table  1.1  shows,  Asia  has  no  shortage  of  IRIs.  The  regional  policy \nforums  of  ASEAN,  ASEAN+3,  and  the  EAS  are  just  three  obvious \nexamples.  Beyond  East  Asia,  one  can  point  to  subregional  forums \nsuch  as  SAARC,  PIF,  and  CAREC.  There  are  also  major  forums  that \nconnect Asian countries with non-Asian ones, such as APEC and ASEM. \nFigure 1.1, which is taken from the Emerging Asian Regionalism study \n(ADB 2008b), depicts major subregional, intraregional, and transregional \noragnizations.  It  makes  clear  that  Asia\u2019s  institutional  landscape  is \nmultilayered  and  overlapping,  and  reflects  the  reality  that  regional \nintegration in Asia arose haphazardly rather than being planned.\n\nTable 1.1 and Figure 1.1 show the complexity of Asia\u2019s institutional \narchitecture  for  regionalism:  the  stereotype  that  Asian  integration \nis  \u201cpoorly  institutionalized\u201d  is  misleading.  However,  most  Asian \ninstitutions operate with few explicit procedural rules, delegate few \ntasks  to  standing  secretariats,  and  specify  few  obligations  for  their \nmembers.3 Asia\u2019s  IRIs  are  typically  based  on  a  consensus  approach \nto  decision-making,  supplemented  by  nonbinding  voluntary \n\n3  Some of Asia\u2019s IRIs have gone further than others in committing to standing procedures \n\nand rules-based arrangements, as Chapter 4 details.\n\n9\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 1.1.

Expressed  in  the  terminology  of  international  relations, \nregional cooperation in Asia entails only limited legalization, defined \nas a situation where rules are binding and precise, and where their \ninterpretation,  monitoring,  and  implementation  are  delegated  to  a \nthird party.4 \n\n4  Again, though, some IRIs are more legalized than others.\n\n10\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\nThus,  Asia\u2019s  regional  architecture  is  both  complex  and  light \nat  the  same  time:  it  has  a  dense  and  elaborate  web  of  sometimes \noverlapping  institutional  arrangements  which  tend  to  center  on \nnegotiations  among  national  governments  rather  than  delegating \nauthority  to  regional  bodies  or  engaging  civil  society.  Asia\u2019s  IRIs \ninvolve  cooperation  in  specific  fields  among  national  governments \nthat retain their sovereignty, rather than the creation and operation \nof  bodies  or  authorities  transcending  those  sovereign  states.  Asia\u2019s \nIRIs  emphasize  flexibility,  informality,  and  consensus:  they  can  be \nthought  of  as  confidence-building  exercises  which  aim  to  create \nan  environment  conducive  to  building  trust  and,  on  that  basis, \nprogressive integration. \n\nAsia  has  adopted  this  approach  for  good  reasons.  In  such  a  vast \nand  diverse  region,  defining  common  structures  and  governance \nrules  requires  flexibility  and  pragmatism.  Several  Asian  countries \nare  postcolonial  societies  that  attach  special  value  to  their  national \nsovereignty,  limiting  the  appeal  of  pursuing  a  regional  agenda \nthat  requires  compromising  national  priorities.  Given  the  region\u2019s \ncomplicated  history  and  cultural  and  social  mix,  Asian  countries  are \nusually  unwilling  to  criticize  their  neighbors\u2014or  to  tolerate  criticism \nfrom them\u2014limiting the capacity for adopting sanctions or even setting \nup feedback mechanisms based on objective performance indicators. \nFor  all  these  reasons,  efforts  to  regularize  relations  and  build \nregional \ninteraction \namong  governments  within  project-specific  and  network-oriented \narrangements, framed in a manner that does not threaten sovereign \nprerogatives.  This  approach\u2014sometimes  referred  to  as  the  \u201cASEAN \nway\u201d  after  the  institution  that  pioneered  it\u2014has  been  important \nfor  cultivating  the  confidence  and  trust  needed  to  build  support  for \ndeeper cooperation and integration. It has successfully reconciled the \nvalue that countries and their residents attach to national sovereignty \nwith  the  need  for  common  rules  and  regulatory  standards\u2014and \ngovernance thereof\u2014to support Asia\u2019s integrating markets.\n\ninstitutions  have  concentrated  on  ongoing \n\nThe Challenge\nWhat  has  worked  well  in  the  past  may  work  less  well  in  the  future, \nhowever.  The  first  step  in  integrating  markets\u2014namely,  reducing \nrestrictive border regulations\u2014can be achieved unilaterally or through \nnegotiations, bilateral or regional, between governments. Compliance \nwith such commitments is relatively straightforward to monitor. Asia \nhas thus made significant progress in reducing and eliminating tariff \n\n11\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nand nontariff barriers to trade by unilateral action, negotiating bilateral \nfree  trade  agreements,  and  establishing  an  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area \n(AFTA)\u2014but  without  establishing  rules-based  structures  oriented  on \nexternal  enforcement,  like  those  provided  at  the  global  level  by  the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO).  \n\nAfter this first step, however, progress becomes harder. The last \nremaining tariff barriers are the most sensitive (by definition, otherwise \nthey would already have been removed). Liberalizing trade in parts and \ncomponents was easy: importing countries were enthusiastic because \nthis  facilitated  the  production  for  export  of  final  goods.  Liberalizing \nfinal-goods trade is harder, since it pits domestic and foreign producers \nwithin the region against one another. Unilateral liberalization, which \nhas carried much of Asian liberalization to this point, becomes trickier \nas more politically sensitive areas come into play. And once countries \nhave created a web of bilateral and subregional free trade agreements, \nrationalizing  the  resulting  \u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d  of  agreements  poses  more \nformidable collective action problems. \n\nMore generally, market integration and competition are impeded \nnot just by border restrictions but also by behind-the-border tax and \nregulatory policies favoring some (typically domestic) producers over \nothers. These include limits on entry by foreign suppliers of services, \ndiscriminatory  public  procurement  practices,  trade-limiting  product \nstandards,  and  limits  on  foreign  direct  investment.  International \ndifferences in contract and sales law, including those whose purpose \nis not to bias outcomes in favor of buyers and sellers from one country \nover another, heighten uncertainty and create enforcement costs that \nalso limit cross-border trade and competition.\n\nAt  this  point,  however,  information  on  policies  becomes  more \ncostly to obtain and assimilate. Monitoring governments\u2019 compliance \nwith the provisions of their agreements is more difficult. Since there is \na wide range of possible regulatory policies, no single alternative may \nbe preferred by the median policy-maker, requiring an agenda setter \nto organize and direct the process. For all these reasons, progress may \nrequire  the  delegation  of  negotiation,  monitoring,  and  enforcement \nfunctions to an entity other than governments. \n\nAs regional integration deepens, competition across borders also \nbecomes  more  intense.  This  widens  the  scope  for  disputes  among \naffected parties in different countries. Increases in the frequency and \nintensity of disputes create a need for strengthened dispute settlement \nmechanisms.  In  a  more  deeply  integrated  regional  market  there \nis  also  more  need  for  harmonized  product  standards  and  market \nregulations. This, in turn, requires closer coordination and monitoring \n\n12\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\nof  national  practices.  In  addition,  spillovers  intensify  as  markets \ngrow  more  integrated,  heightening  the  importance  of  coordinating \nin  turn,  requires \nmacroeconomic  and  financial  policies.  This, \nstrengthened monitoring of national policies. \n\nAs  countries  open  up  financially,  global  and  regional  spillovers \ntend  to  intensify,  making  it  more  important  for  governments  and \ncentral banks to coordinate their policies. With increasing openness \nand integration comes greater exposure to external shocks, emanating \nfrom  both  within  the  region  and  outside.  The  economic  disruption \ncaused  by  the  2008/09  crisis  is  a  reminder  of  Asia\u2019s  vulnerability  to \nsuch shocks.\n\nThis  exposure  makes  it  more  important,  as  Asia\u2019s  economies \ncontinue to open and integrate, for them to have access to emergency \ncredit lines. This too is something that is appropriately organized at the \nregional level, and also requires strengthened surveillance of national \npolicies, possibly together with policy conditionality, so that external \nparties  are  willing  to  extend  credits.  More  elaborate  institutional \narrangements, not limited to consensus decision-making and involving \nbinding  commitments  and  a  greater  degree  of  delegation,  may  be \nneeded to carry out all of these tasks adequately. \n\nThe  existing  institutional  architecture  may  not  be  adequate  for \nextending the process of deep integration beyond East Asia to South \nand Central Asia and the Pacific. These subregions are not as integrated \ninternally as East Asia. Nor are economic and financial links between \nEast  Asia  and  these  other  subregions  sufficiently  well  developed. \nInstitutions that evolved to support economic and financial integration \namong a limited number of Asian countries, often neighbors within a \nsingle  subregion,  may  not  be  ideally  suited  for  integrating  the  larger \nnumber of economies that now aspire to be part of \u201cFactory Asia.\u201d \n\nThe  result  is  an  Asian  economy  that  is  extensively  but  unevenly \nintegrated.  Some  product  markets,  notably  those  in  manufacturing \nparts and components, are more deeply integrated than others\u2014those \nin  labor-intensive  services,  for  example.  Some  factor  markets,  such \nas those for skilled workers, are more deeply integrated than others, \nnotably those for unskilled labor. Some subregions, notably East Asia, \nare  more  deeply  integrated  than  others,  such  as  South  and  Central \nAsia.  Some  regional  policies,  such  those  promoting  bond  market \ndevelopment,  are  more  closely  coordinated  than  others,  such  as \nmonetary and fiscal policies.\n\nFinally, as Asian economies become more deeply integrated with \neach  other  and  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  it  becomes  increasingly \nimportant to ensure the compatibility of regional and global integration. \n\n13\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nPolicies and measures to cement Asian integration should also help \nfoster Asia\u2019s links with the global economy. Institutional arrangements \nat the regional level should complement analogous ones at the global \nlevel, not compete or conflict with them.\n\n1.3. Approaches to Regional \nInstitution Building\n\nApproaches to strengthening Asia\u2019s IRIs through reform and innovation \nshould reflect not only the preferences of national governments and \nother relevant public agencies, but also those of civil society, opinion \nformers,  and  the  general  public  about  appropriate  modalities  for \ninstitution building\u2014otherwise they are unlikely to attract the political \nsupport needed to make them a reality.\n\nThe  survey  of  regional  opinion  leaders  commissioned  for  this \nreport,  described  in  more  detail  in  Appendix  1,  sheds  light  on  those \npreferences.  As  Figure  1.2  shows,  there  is  broad-based  support  for \nstrengthening, consolidating, and streamlining existing IRIs. As many \nas 80% of respondents express strong support for this approach. These \nresults suggest that existing IRIs should be at the center of the region\u2019s \nfurther institution-building efforts. \n\nThere  is  also  support  for  creating  new  institutions  to  deepen \nregional  integration:  44%  of  respondents  are  in  favor,  and  only  17% \nagainst. That said, the fact that 35% of respondents say they are neither \nfor  nor  against  suggests  that  a  lot  depends  on  the  precise  form  and \nfunction of any new IRIs. \n\nBuilding from the Bottom Up \nIf Asia follows a bottom\u2013up approach to building its regional institutions, \nis  it  better  to  proceed  on  a  geographical  or  a  functional  basis?  One \napproach would be to ask, for what geographic collection of countries \nare the efficiency advantages of further institutionalization likely to be \ngreatest and the sacrifices of sovereignty least? Is ASEAN, ASEAN+3, \nEAS, or some other grouping ripe for further institutionalization on the \ngrounds that cross-border spillovers are particularly pronounced and \nmember governments have similar policy preferences?5 \n\n14\n\n5  Chapter 2 reviews some of the relevant evidence.\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\nFigure 1.2.

The question was: \nIndicate to what extent you agree (or disagree) with the appropriateness of the different modalities for enhancing institutions for regionalism in Asia \nand the Pacific.\n\nSource: ADB (2010).\n\nAn alternative approach would be to ask, for what issue areas or \nfunctions  are  the  efficiency  advantages  of  deeper  institutionalization \ngreatest  and  the  sacrifices  of  sovereignty  least?  Does  trade,  finance, \nenvironment,  infrastructure,  or  some  other  area  involve  particularly \nstrong  cross-border  spillovers  and  compatible  preferences  among \ngovernments? Should countries start by negotiating and completing more \nsubregional free trade agreements along the lines of AFTA, and more \nbilateral ones such as those between ASEAN and other Asian countries? \nShould the priority be further subregional financial cooperation, such \nas the harmonization of financial regulations across the region or the \nmultilateralization of the ASEAN+3 Chiang Mai Initiative and its newly \nestablished regional surveillance office? Should it be further efforts to \nstrengthen cooperation in areas such as infrastructure, which previous \nstudies\u2014notably Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia (ADB/ADBI 2009)\u2014\nhave suggested are ripe for development? Or should it be cooperation \nin enhancing security and fighting terrorism, which has long been the \nfocus of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation?6\n\n6  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has now also introduced a far-reaching economic \n\ncooperation agenda.\n\n15\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nSuch questions are difficult to answer. There is no single way of \nquantifying the extent of cross-border interdependence and spillovers. \nThere is no definitive measure of the similarity (or dissimilarity) of policy \npreferences across countries or of the willingness of governments to \ncompromise their sovereignty over specific issues on instrumental or \nstrategic grounds. \n\nBringing  together  these  geographical  and  functional  perspectives \nleads to the question of whether different groupings are appropriate for \ndifferent functional areas. One approach, known as \u201cvariable geometry\u201d \n(or multitrack or multispeed), is for different countries to choose whether \nor  not  to  participate  in  integration  efforts  in  different  issue  areas.  For \nexample,  one  subgroup  of  countries  may  wish  to  push  forward  with \neconomic integration, another subgroup with security cooperation, and \nonly a few countries with both. Signs of de facto variable geometry in \nAsia include the fact that \u201ccooperators\u201d such as Singapore have been \nactive in forging free trade agreements with bilateral partners while also \nparticipating in ASEAN and its free trade area.\n\nAnother  approach,  sometimes  known  as  \u201cconcentric  circles,\u201d \nis  for  a  hard  core  or  inner  circle  of  countries  to  proceed  to  a  more \nextensive  and  heavily  institutionalized  form  of  regional  integration, \nwith  implications  for  a  wide  variety  of  issue  areas,  in  which  other \nmembers do not participate, at least initially. The idea is to build a set of \nregional institutions to which the pioneers opt in, while other countries, \nmore  reluctant  to  cede  sovereignty,  opt  out.  The  question  then  is, \nwhat rules and which countries decide who opts in and out? Are the \nincumbents entitled to prevent outsiders from opting in subsequently \nso  as  to  prevent  them  from  slowing  the  pace  of  institutionalization? \nOr are outsiders entitled to opt in if they satisfy a clearly specified set \nof preconditions so as to prevent the inner circle from becoming an \nexclusive club? \n\nASEAN as a Driver for Regional Integration\nIn  the  Asian  context,  ASEAN  is  sometimes  seen  as  the  \u201cvanguard \ninstitution\u201d  that  is  leading  the  way  to  more  extensive  and  strongly \ninstitutionalized regional integration.7 ASEAN was the first grouping in \nthe  region  to  commit  (in  1992)  to  the  creation  of  a  free  trade  area, \nto adopt a charter with legal obligations for members (2008), and to \nformulate  a  blueprint  for  creating  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community \n\n7  ADB (2006) and Lee (2008) both argue along these lines. See also Chapter 4.\n\n16\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\n(AEC)  by  2015.  The  AEC  will  entail  a  single  market  with  a  fully \nintegrated production base and the free movement of not only goods \nand services but also investment and skilled labor, as well as the freer \nflow  of  capital.8  ASEAN  members  have  agreed  to  augment  the  AEC \nwith  an  ASEAN  Political-Security  Community  and  an  ASEAN  Socio-\nCultural  Community.  The  ASEAN  Charter  also  allows  subgroups  of \nASEAN countries to push ahead with more ambitious agreements \u201cif \nthere is a consensus to do so\u201d (Haggard 2009).\n\nUnlike  most  Asian  IRIs,  ASEAN  has  delegated  a  modicum \nof  authority  to  a  standing  secretariat.  Its  progress  toward  a  more \nlegalized  model  of  organization,  however,  remains  largely  a  matter \nof stated intent. When the AEC blueprint was launched, governments \ndelegated  to  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  increased  responsibilities  for \ninitiating,  advising  on,  coordinating,  and \nimplementing  ASEAN \nactivities. Members then adopted four sets of procedural rules issued \nthrough  detailed,  binding  protocols  requiring  domestic  ratification. \nThese  rules  created  a  regional  dispute  settlement  mechanism,  a \nprotocol  requiring  members  to  give  prenotification  of  their  intent  to \nmodify existing concessions, a protocol governing the modification of \nprevious liberalization commitments, and a protocol that provides rules \ngoverning the exclusion of sensitive sectors from AFTA commitments \n(Khong and Nesdurai 2007).\n\nWhen moving from the creation of AFTA in 1992 to an agreement in \n2003 to establish the AEC by 2015, ASEAN created a legal unit within its \nsecretariat to give legal advice to member states and firms concerning \nlegal disputes arising from the AEC, as well as an ASEAN compliance \nbody  to  mediate  disputes  arising  in  this  context.  The  charter  signed \nat ASEAN\u2019s November 2007 summit in Singapore established a rules-\nbased  entity  and  called  for  the  creation  of  enforceable  rules  for \ntrade,  finance,  and  environment,  together  with  the  establishment \nof  a  regional  human  rights  body,  and  provided  for  the  imposition  of \nsanctions against members that fail to comply with the provisions of \nthe charter. Time will tell whether the grouping will follow through on \nthese commitments.9\n\nMore broadly, ASEAN is influential because of how it has succeeded \nin  developing  a  sense  of  shared  values  and  accepted  procedures.  It \nhas promoted informal and nonbinding institutional models governed \n\n8  www.aseansec.org/18757.htm\n9  Early signs are mixed: for example, no country has yet made use of the ASEAN dispute \n\nsettlement mechanism.\n\n17\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nby  consensus  decision-making.  This  \u201cASEAN  way\u201d  has  been  widely \nemulated by other regional and subregional institutions.\n\nFinally,  several  larger  regional  institutions  have  grown  out  of \nASEAN or developed by associating themselves with it. (In some cases, \nthis  is  evident  from  their  very  names.)  Wider  cooperation  among \nEast Asian countries in response to the financial crisis of 1997/98 was \norganized by bringing together the members of ASEAN with the three \nlargest  East  Asian  economies:  the  PRC,  Japan,  and  the  Republic  of \nKorea.  The  first  meeting  occurred  at  the  initiative  of  ASEAN,  which \ninvited the \u201cPlus Three\u201d countries to the December 1997 meeting of \nASEAN leaders. ASEAN+3 summits continue to be held in conjunction \nwith  the  annual  ASEAN  summit.  Meetings  of  the  EAS  (or  ASEAN+6) \ntake place immediately after the annual ASEAN leaders\u2019 meeting. The \nASEAN Regional Forum is chaired by the chair of the ASEAN Standing \nCommittee.\n\nArguably, then, ASEAN plays a special role in the institutionalization \nof  Asian  integration.  It  serves  as  a  catalyst  for  different  interests  by \nbringing together large and small powers in the region.10 And through \nits  regular  meetings  and  standing  secretariat,  it  provides  a  platform \nfor  ongoing  integration  efforts.  Whether  it  can  continue  to  do  so  as \nthe  process  of  Asian  integration  broadens  (and  its  center  of  gravity \nshifts  away  from  East  Asia)  is  an  open  question.  ASEAN\u2019s  informal \nand  consensus-based approach  has the virtue of enabling members \nwith  diverse  interests  to  remain  nominally  united.  But  this  is  also  its \ngreatest limitation, for it inhibits operational decisiveness and renders \nthe strengthening of regional cooperation more difficult by giving de \nfacto veto rights to those favoring the status quo.\n\nBuilding from the Top Down \nThe  alternative  to  the  bottom\u2013up  approach  is  proceeding  from  the \ntop  down,  by  building  a  pan-regional  institution.  Such  an  institution \nwould  lend  coherence  to  the  jumble  of  specialized  functional  and \nsubregional agreements, fostering consistency across more specialized \nand  localized  institutions  regarding  their  obligations  and  principles. \nIt could set down general principles to govern all Asian IRIs. It could \ndraw  attention  to  externalities:  to  the  fact  that  actions  by  members \nof  an  IRI  also  impact  on  nonmembers.  It  would  provide  a  venue  in \nwhich all Asian countries had a voice. It would be a natural forum for \n\n10  As this is sometimes put, the PRC does not want Japan to lead and Japan does not want \n\nthe PRC to lead; hence ASEAN must lead by default.\n\n18\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\nA  further  rationale  for  the  top\u2013down  approach \n\naddressing issues such as climate change, people trafficking, natural \ndisasters, and epidemics with pan-regional scope and consequences. \nis  that  the \ncompartmentalization  of  economic,  security,  political,  and  other  issues \nhampers efforts to cooperate in each of these issue areas. Cooperation \nmay be easier to sustain when negotiations over several distinct issues \nare linked. With the entire set of issues on the table in a single forum, the \nscope for mutually beneficial agreements (cross-issue tradeoffs) will be \nenlarged. For example, countries that might resist agreements on political \nor security matters that are a priority for their neighbors might be willing \nto sign on in return for an agreement on economic matters which they \ndeem important. The costs of failing to cooperate in any area would also \nbe magnified insofar as this sours prospects for cooperating in other areas. \nBoth political scientists and economists have suggested that the \nparticular structure of economic and security interactions means that \nlinking negotiations in the two areas is likely to increase the chances \nof a cooperative outcome. (See Chapter 3 for details.) Intuitively, the \ndevelopment of more extensive economic cooperation and integration \n(the rise of \u201cFactory Asia\u201d) has heightened the incentive to cooperate \non security matters (since a security conflict within the region would \nlead to economic disruptions with greater costs).\n\nAlthough  foreign  policy  and  national  security  concerns  have \ninfluenced  the  pattern  of  Asian  institution  building,  as  described  in \nmore detail in Chapter 5, economic and security relations in Asia have \nbeen pursued on distinct institutional tracks, which seldom reinforce \nor interfere with one another. Even institutions that pursue both sets \nof issues, such as ASEAN, do so without explicitly linking economics \nand security. This suggests that the potential for synergies has not been \nfully exploited and an encompassing regional institution would be well \npositioned to do so. \n\nImplications \nAsia  has  reaped  enormous  benefits  from  the  deepening  of  regional \nintegration.  The  achievements  of  recent  decades  have  resulted  to  a \nconsiderable extent from \u201cspontaneous cooperation\u201d growing out of \nindividual country actions (notably the PRC\u2019s unilateral opening) and \nglobal commitments (such as additional Asian countries\u2019 accession to \nthe WTO).11 Spontaneous though that cooperation may have been, it \n\n11  The phrase \u201cspontaneous cooperation\u201d is taken from Richard Baldwin\u2019s background paper \n\nfor this project (Baldwin 2009).\n\n19\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nhas spurred much deeper and more intricate patterns of integration in \nthe region, as documented in the Emerging Asian Regionalism study \n(ADB 2008b). \n\nAn important task now is to cement existing achievements. The \n2008/09 crisis is a reminder of their fragility. Past gains may be placed \nat  risk,  as  they  were  in  1997/98,  as  national  governments  grapple \nwith  newly  pressing  problems.  Building  stronger  and  more  effective \nregional institutions is an important way of protecting what has been \nachieved. \n\nMoreover,  insofar  as  the  constructive  response  to  the  crisis  is \nfor  Asian  countries  to  push  ahead  with  deeper  integration,  stronger \nregional  institutions  will  be  needed.  It  was  possible  to  reduce \nand  remove  barriers  at  the  border  (tariffs  and  quotas)  through \nunilateral  action,  one-off  bilateral  agreements,  and  global  (WTO) \ncommitments\u2014that is, through spontaneous cooperation. Removing \nbehind-the-border  barriers  and  moving  to  deeper  integration\u2014\nbuilding a truly integrated Asian market not just in goods but also in \nlabor and investment capital, broadening the process to include all of \nAsia, and ensuring the compatibility of regional integration with global \nintegration\u2014will require stronger institutional arrangements.\n\nImportantly,  what  is  in  Asia\u2019s  interests  will  also  benefit  the  rest \nof  the  world.  Failure  to  solidify  previous  gains  would  have  global \nconsequences:  disputes  and  ill-advised  policy  measures  that  disrupt \ntrade  and  production  in  the  region  would  threaten  the  vigor  of  the \nfastest-growing  part  of  the  world  which  is  contributing  most  to  the \ngrowth  of  global  demand.  The  rebalancing  of  demand,  achieved \nin  part  through  the  development  of  stronger  regional  institutions \nto  ensure  policy  coordination,  is  essential  for  the  reduction  of  the \ninterregional trade and current account imbalances that can be held \npartly responsible for the current crisis. Stronger regional institutions \nwill also contribute to effective global governance. They constitute a \nmechanism through which Asia can formulate and advance its views \nin  global  forums.  More  regional  coherence  achieved  through  the \noperation of stronger institutions means better representation of Asia \nin global institutions and hence more effective global governance.\n\n20\n\n\fIntroduction: Institutions for Asian Integration \n\nChapter 2\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n21\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\nA  sia\u2019s importance in the world economy is increasing faster \n\n than ever. After bouncing back from the 1997/98 financial  \n crisis, Asia\u2019s emerging economies have continued to grow  \n strongly  amid  the  widespread  slowdown  generated  by  \n the global crisis of 2008/09. They are thus outperforming \nthe rest of the world even more than before. Developing economies \nacross  the  region  are  closing  the  income  gap  with  more  advanced \nnations, although inequality within countries is worryingly on the rise. \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India are leading the current \nphase of Asia\u2019s economic development. However, these two countries \nhave  not\u2014and  could  not  have\u2014achieved  fast  economic  growth  in \nisolation: they are part of a dynamic wider region that is continuing to \nintegrate while building closer links to the global economy. \n\nBased on the findings of an earlier Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nstudy  Emerging  Asian  Regionalism  (EAR)  (ADB  2008b),  this  chapter \nprovides an update on the progress of regional economic integration \nin Asia and the Pacific, the extent to which countries have promoted \nintegration through policy cooperation, and the regional landscape that \nis emerging from these developments. These findings will inform the \ndiscussion  about  institutions  for  regionalism  in  subsequent  chapters \nand measure progress towards the study\u2019s long-term vision of an Asian \neconomic community.\n\nDefining  Asia  can  be  difficult  because  concepts  of  the  region \ndiffer and change for a variety of reasons. The geographical coverage \nof this study is defined by ADB\u2019s regional membership, which includes \n48 countries that are part of the Asia and the Pacific region. The complete \nlist of countries covered in this study is shown in Table 2.1.

Measuring GDP at purchasing power \nparity, the region accounts for more than a third (34.3% in 2009) of the \nworld economy (see Table A2.1 in the appendix to this chapter). \n\nAsia\u2019s economy has grown much faster than those of other regions \nin recent years, but progress has been unequal among subregions and \nover time (Sally 2010). As documented in the EAR study, many East Asian \neconomies have been \u201cflying in sequence\u201d (Akamatsu 1962; World Bank \n1993; Yamazawa 1990). Economies with limited technical and production \ncapacity were able to grow their domestic industries by importing goods \nand technologies from the region\u2019s more advanced economies. \n\nAs  emerging  economies  created  their  own  industries,  they \nsucceeded in replacing imports with domestic production; and once \ntheir  domestic  firms  became  more  internationally  competitive,  they \nbecame successful exporters too, as Box 2.1 explains in greater detail \n(ADB 2008b). While this model does not necessarily apply to Central \n\nBox 2.1. East Asia\u2019s \u201cFlying Geese\u201d\n\nindustrial  structure  shifted \n\nDeveloping  economies  usually  depend \n\non  imports  of  high-tech  industrial  goods \nfrom advanced economies. Led by Japan, \nhowever, East Asian emerging economies fostered \nindustrial  development  by  substituting  imports, \ntechnologies \nmastering  product  and  process \nto  serve  the  domestic  market,  and  eventually \npromoting  exports  of  various  industrial  products. \nlabor-\nTheir \nintensive products such as textiles to more capital-\nintensive  ones  such  as  steel,  and  later  more \ntechnology-intensive industries such as electronics \nand  machinery.  Across  East  Asia,  a  series  of \ncountries  emulated  Japan\u2019s  model  of  industrial \ndevelopment: \nindustrializing \neconomies  (Hong  Kong,  China;  the  Republic  of \nKorea; Singapore; and Taipei,China); next the four \nlargest  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN)  economies  (Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines,  and  Thailand);  then  the  People\u2019s \n\nthe  newly \n\nfrom \n\nfirst \n\nRepublic of China; and more recently the smaller \nASEAN economies of Viet Nam, Cambodia, and the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.  \n\nIn  many  cases, \n\nThis  industrial  development  pattern  has  had \nimportant  implications  for  regional  economic \nindustrial \ninterdependence. \nproducts are assembled in one East Asian country \nfrom  parts  and  components  produced  in  others. \nWhen trade barriers are low, economic integration \nis  thus  the  result  of  creating  regional  production \nnetworks  in  industries  such  as  electronics  and \nmachinery,  where  final  goods  are  assembled  in \n(and  exported  from)  economies  with  abundant \nlow-cost  labor,  while  parts  and  components  are \nproduced  in  (and  imported  from)  economies \nwith  more  sophisticated \ntechnologies  and \nhuman  capital.  This  production-based  economic \ninterdependence  explains  the  rapid  increase  in \nintraregional and intra-industry trade in East Asia \nover the past 25 years.\n\n25\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 2.1.

Their \ndiversity, development pattern, and global integration have generated \na  unique  Asian  model  of  regionalism\u2014dynamic,  open,  multitrack, \nand  multispeed\u2014which  enhances  prosperity  not  only  in  the  region \nbut also in the rest of the world. Asia\u2019s open regionalism underscores \nthe importance of strengthening trade, investment, and capital flows \nwithin  the  region  while  maintaining  strong  ties  with  and  remaining \nopen  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  Economic  indicators  confirm  that \nregional  integration  within  Asia  has  proceeded  in  parallel  with  its \nglobal integration (Kharas, Aldaz-Carrol, and Rahardja 2008).\n\nSeveral studies cite East Asia as a model of how economic growth \nand  regional  integration  can  create  a  virtuous  circle,  whereby  rapid \nGDP  growth  fuels  regional  economic  interdependence  and  closer \nregional  integration  facilitates  faster  growth  and  eventually  poverty \n\n26\n\n\freduction (Schiff and Winters 2003; Tarr and Grugel 2003; Rodrik 2007). \nAs  East  Asia  moves  beyond  the  \u201cflying  geese\u201d  pattern  of  industrial \ndevelopment, regional economic integration is becoming an important \nengine of growth: the establishment of regional production networks \nand  the  expansion  of  trade  ties  are  helping  to  foster  a  competitive \nbusiness  environment  that  promotes  technological  development, \nproduct and process innovation, and a rapid upgrading of labor skills \nacross the region (Gill and Kharas 2007).13\n\nThe \u201cfragmentation\u201d of production\u2014the scattering of parts of the \nproduction process across different countries\u2014is a major contributor \nto  regional  (and  global)  economic  integration  because  it  stimulates \nforeign  direct  investment  (FDI)  and  the  intensification  of  trade  in \nintermediate goods. The rapid expansion of manufacturing exports and \nan increase in the trade/GDP ratios of dynamic East Asian economies \nhave,  in  turn,  boosted  GDP  growth  in  recent  decades  (Athukorala \n2005). Intraregional trade in parts and components has also risen as the \npattern of regional production has become more specialized. The PRC \nhas become the main assembly plant for \u201cFactory Asia,\u201d and thereby a \nsignificant export destination for other East Asian economies as well as \na base for exporting to the rest of the world (ADB 2007, 2008b).\n\nRegional  integration  continues  to  be  a  key  driver  of  economic \ngrowth  for  the  newly  industrializing  economies  (NIEs)  and  more \nadvanced Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies, \nwhich rely on the PRC and, increasingly, other lower-income East Asian \ncountries  for  assembly  operations.  It  is  also  now  boosting  growth  in \npoorer  ASEAN  economies  such  as  Viet  Nam  and  Cambodia,  whose \nexport  sectors  rely  on  the  import  of  intermediate  goods  from  their \nneighbors for their viability. Moreover, as the recent global economic \nand financial crisis pushes East Asia towards a more balanced pattern \nof  economic  growth\u2014where  domestic  demand  becomes  a  more \nimportant  driver  alongside  exports\u2014Asian  economies  will  become \nincreasingly  important  markets  for  each  other\u2019s  final  products  (ADB \n2009b). Regional integration will thus become an even more important \nelement of growth and poverty reduction in Asia.\n\nWhile Asia\u2019s economic dynamism has lifted hundreds of millions \nof people out of poverty, the region is still home to around two-thirds \nof the world\u2019s poor. Asia is a region of contrasts: vast in size as well as \n\n13  The region\u2019s opinion leaders surveyed for this study perceive \u201cfaster and more dynamic \neconomic growth\u201d as the main advantage of strengthening intraregional economic \nrelations. This echoes the findings of a similar survey conducted for the EAR study two \nyears earlier (see Appendix 1 to this report).\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n27\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nin the diversity of its members. The income gap between the richest  \nand  poorest  countries\u2014albeit  rapidly  declining\u2014is  greater  than  in \nthe  Americas,  Africa,  the  Middle  East,  or  Europe,  and  the  range  of \npolitical systems, religions, and cultures is also greater than elsewhere \n(Capannelli, Lee, and Petri 2009).\n\nWhile  Asia\u2019s  diversity  poses  daunting  challenges  for  regional \nintegration and cooperation, the prize offered by closer regionalism is \ngreat. By working together, countries in Asia and the Pacific can unlock \ntheir  vast  economic  potential,  achieve  sustained,  rapid  growth,  and \nincrease the living standards of their citizens. Asian regionalism can help \nstrengthen physical connectivity, expand trade and investment, enhance \nfinancial development, promote macroeconomic and financial stability, \nand improve health, environmental, and social conditions. It can do so \nthrough cooperation in four interrelated areas: regional and subregional \nprograms on cross-border infrastructure; trade and investment; money \nand  finance;  and  regional  public  goods,  such  as  the  prevention  of \ncommunicable  diseases,  environmental  protection,  the  management \nof natural calamities, and so on (ADB 2006).\n\nBut  to  what  extent  have  Asian  economies  become  more \ninterdependent?  Has  regional  policy  cooperation  been  effective  in \nfacilitating  economic  integration?  To  answer  these  questions,  this \nchapter updates the analysis conducted in the EAR study, expands its \nscope to cover the entire Asia and Pacific region, and discusses new \nissues that have emerged since the 2008/09 global crisis. \n\nThe chapter is structured as follows. Sections 2.1\u20132.5 chart the extent \nof regional integration in trade and investment, money and finance, and \nlabor markets; gauge macroeconomic interdependence; and examine \nregional  infrastructure  ties.  The  progress  of  regional  cooperation\u2014 \nincluding the proliferation of free trade agreements, recent initiatives for \nmacroeconomic and financial cooperation, and programs for delivering \nregional  public  goods\u2014is  discussed  in  Sections  2.6\u20132.8.

With  many \nparts  and  components  required  in  the  assembly  process,  trade  in \nintermediate  goods  has  helped  link  East  Asian  economies  together. \nInvestment  in  infrastructure  has  also  improved  competitiveness  and \nconnectivity,  helping  to  attract  FDI  from  multinational  corporations. \nIntegration  in  final  goods  remains  moderate,  however,  because \nassembled goods are mostly exported to North America and Europe. \n\nMany  studies  have  documented  the  positive  effect  of  trade \nliberalization  on  economic  growth  (for  instance,  Sachs  and  Warner \n1995, and more recently Wacziarg and Welch 2008).

Overall,  trade  is  now  as  important  to  Asia  (especially \nEast Asia) as it is to the European Union (EU), and accounts for a much \nbigger share of GDP in Asia than it does in North America.\n\nOne measure of a region\u2019s trade interdependence is the share of \ntrade within the region in its total trade, or intraregional trade share. \nOver  the  past  50  years  Asia\u2019s  intraregional  trade  share  has  shot  up, \novertaking North America\u2019s and closing the gap with the EU, as panel A \nin  Figure  2.2  shows.  Panel  B  highlights  how  some  Asian  subregions \n(notably  Northeast  and  Southeast  Asia)  are  far  more  integrated  than \nothers.  Trade  within  East  Asia  has  increased  to  more  than  half  of  its \ntotal trade in recent years.\n\nAnother  indicator  of  a  region\u2019s  trade  interdependence  is  its \nintraregional  trade  intensity,  which  measures  its  bias  for  trading  with \nregional partners. Whereas a region\u2019s intraregional trade share tends to \nincrease with its weight in world trade, its intraregional trade intensity \ndoes so only when trade within the region rises faster than trade with \nthe  rest  of  the  world.

Whereas nearly 58% of Asia\u2019s trade in parts and \ncomponents was within the region in 2008, less than 45% of its trade in \nfinal goods was, as Table 2.4 shows. Looking at subregions, whereas \n56.3%  of  East  Asia\u2019s  trade  in  parts  and  components  was  within  the \nsubregion, a mere 1.2% of Central Asia\u2019s and 1.3% of South Asia\u2019s was. \nAnd while nearly half (43.4%) of East Asia\u2019s trade in final goods was \nwithin the region, only 2.9% of Central Asia\u2019s and 2.8% of South Asia\u2019s \nwas. Box 2.2 explains the extent to which Asia is still dependent on the \nUnited States (US) and Europe as markets for its final-goods exports. \n\nAsia\u2019s  reputation  as  the  world\u2019s  factory  is  directly  related  to  its \nincreasing  share  of  global  manufacturing  exports,  which  rose  from \naround 27% in 1992 to 34% in 2008. These exports are sourced from \nproduction networks\u2014almost entirely in East Asia\u2014based on supply \nchains  that  procure  parts  and  components  from  a  large  number  of \nfirms  located  in  different  countries  for  final  assembly  in  a  separate \nlocation that serves as an export base.

In  view  of  this \nfact, \u201cFactory Asia\u201d should be named \u201cFactory East Asia.\u201d\n\nHowever,  South  Asia\u2019s  manufacturing  trade  is  growing  rapidly, \nmore than tripling from $92 billion in 2000 to $322 billion in 2008; East \nAsia\u2019s more than doubled from $2.2 trillion to $4.9 trillion over the same \nperiod. While East Asia\u2019s share of world manufacturing trade rose from \n25% to 27% over this period, South Asia\u2019s increased from 0.9% to 1.5%, \nas Table 2.5 shows. South Asia\u2019s manufacturing imports from East Asia \nhave grown much faster than its exports to that region, resulting in an \nexpanding deficit\u2014mostly due to India\u2019s bilateral deficit with the PRC. \nSouth Asia\u2019s trade in parts and components has also increased, notably \nits imports from East Asia. The PRC now accounts for more than 20% of \nIndia\u2019s imports of parts and components, as panel B of Figure 2.4 shows.\n\n32\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\nBox 2.2. Sources of Demand for Asian Exports\n\nFigure 2.B1 provides evidence of where final \n\ndemand  for  Asia\u2019s  exports  comes  from,  \nfor  14  Asian  countries  for  which  data  are \navailable.  The  methodology  used  to  prepare \nthis  figure\u2014based  on  the  Global  Trade  Analysis \nProject\u2014divides  exports  into  final  goods  meant \nfor  consumption  and  intermediate  goods,  which \nare  used  for  further  production  activities.  The \nfigures  show  that  although  only  54.5%  of  Asia\u2019s \nexports were destined outside the region in 2007, \nfinal demand from non-Asian countries ultimately \n\nabsorbed more than 70% of them because trade \nwithin the region was dominated by intermediate \nproducts.\n\nThis high trade dependence on final demand \noutside  the  region  explains  why  the  2008/09 \nglobal  economic  crisis  caused  Asian  trade  to \nslump.  Collapsing  demand  in  the  United  States \nand  Europe  hit  Asian  trade  hard,  prompting  a \nrenewed debate on the need for Asia to rebalance \nits  growth  model  towards  a  greater  reliance  on \ndomestic (and regional) demand.\n\nFigure 2.B1.

Recent studies confirm that India is still not a part \nof regional production networks (Debroy 2009; McDonald, Robinson, \nand Thierfelder 2008), although this may change in coming years.

Central Asia\u2019s Links with East Asia\n\nlinks  have  gradually \n\nA fter  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union \n\nin  1991,  the  newly  independent  states \nof  Central  Asia  cautiously  opened  their \nborders with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nInfrastructure \nimproved, \nstarting with the first railway connection between \nKazakhstan  and  the  PRC  in  1990.  Several  roads \nbetween  the  PRC  and  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and Tajikistan have since been upgraded. \nAir connections now exist between Central Asian \nhubs  and  the  PRC,  India,  the  Republic  of  Korea, \nMalaysia, and Thailand.\n\nTrade links between Central and East Asia are \noverwhelmingly with the PRC. The volume of trade \nis  difficult  to  identify  precisely,  however,  because \ntrade statistics are inconsistent. For example, while \nthe PRC reported exports to the Kyrgyz Republic of \n$9,213  million  in  2008,  Kyrgyz  statistics  indicated \nimports of only $728 million from the PRC for the \nsame year (Mogilevsky 2009). Such discrepancies \nreflect the preponderance of unrecorded and illicit \ntrade.  Legal  trade  between  Central  Asia  and  the \nPRC  consists  primarily  of  exports  of  minerals  and \nenergy  from  Central  Asia  in  return  for  imports  of \nmanufactured  goods\u2014mostly  finished  products\u2014\nfrom the PRC and other East Asian countries. The \nKyrgyz Republic acts as an important entrep\u00f4t for \nthis trade by operating huge bazaars in Bishkek and \n\nOsh where imported goods are sold to customers \nfrom  various  Central  Asian  countries,  primarily \nUzbekistan. While this intermediary function could \nbe considered part of a network from producer to \nfinal consumer, the slim trade between Central and \nEast  Asia  is  not  based  on  the  kind  of  production \nnetworks that tie East Asia together.\n\nWhy  does  Central  Asia  not  play  a  role \nin \nregional  production  networks?  Formal \ntrade  barriers  such  as  tariffs  are  fairly  low  in \nCentral Asia, but trade costs tend to be high. For \nexample,  Central  Asian  countries  rank  very  low \nin  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business  database  in \nterms of the cost in money and time of exporting \nor importing a standard container, in part because \nof the region\u2019s landlocked status.  \n\nBut  the  large  inflows  of  Chinese  consumer \ngoods  and  entrepreneurial  activity \nin  Kyrgyz \nbazaars suggest that the physical and bureaucratic \nobstacles  to  trade  are  not  insuperable.  Physical \nconnectivity  has  greatly \nin  recent \nyears  (especially  through  the  PRC\u2019s  Xinjiang \nAutonomous  Region)  and  air-freight  links  could \nbe established. The main obstacles to Central Asia \nbecoming  part  of  \u201cFactory  Asia\u201d  are  inadequate \ninstitutions  and  the  high  cost  of  doing  business, \nboth  of  which  impede  the  fragmentation  of \nproduction into complex value chains.\n\nimproved \n\nIntraregional  FDI  flows  and  stocks  provide  additional  measures \nof the extent to which production is regionally and globally integrated. \nHowever, FDI statistics are much less plentiful and reliable than trade \ndata, limiting comparability over time and across regions.14 \n\n14  National agencies such as boards of investment or authorities in charge of issuing licenses \n\nfor manufacturing operations are usually reliable sources for FDI data, but such data \nare poorly available and classifications still largely differ across countries, despite some \nattempts at harmonization by ASEAN.\n\n35\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 2.5.

Nearly 70% of FDI in 15 East Asian countries \n(ASEAN+3 plus Hong Kong, China and Taipei,China) now comes from \nthose  countries,  as  Figure  2.5  shows;  the  intraregional  share  was \nalmost as high as in the EU-15 in 2005. More detailed statistics suggest \nthat  roughly  a  third  of  intraregional  FDI  flows  to  these  15  East  Asian \ncountries come from Hong Kong, China and another third from Japan.\nThe  ASEAN  Secretariat  has  compiled  more  recent  data  on  FDI \ninflows and outflows for ASEAN members. Only 15% of net inflows to \nASEAN countries in 2006\u20132008 originated within ASEAN, and a further \n19% from other Asian countries, as Table 2.6 shows. The EU accounted \nfor 23% and the US for 7%. Among ASEAN members, the Philippines \nwas least inclined to receive FDI from other ASEAN members, while \nCambodia,  Thailand,  Indonesia,  and  Malaysia  were  more  closely \nintegrated  by  this  measure.  These  figures  highlight  that  regional \nproduction  integration  through  FDI  is  much  higher  across  the  wider \nEast Asian region than within ASEAN.\n\n36\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\nTable 2.6.

East Asian countries are also moderately \nintegrated  in  final  goods  and  services.  However,  Central  Asia,  South \nAsia,  and  the  Pacific  Islands  are  poorly  integrated  in  all  categories \nof  trade\u2014intermediate  goods,  final  goods,  and  services.  As  markets \nalone  seem  unable  to  correct  these  low  trade  intensities,  regional \ninitiatives may be needed to foster closer economic integration within \nthese three subregions, as well as between them and East Asia. \n\n38\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\n2.2. Labor Mobility\n\nThe history of labor migration in Asia and the Pacific has been marked \nby  colonization  and  decolonization  processes,  changes  in  political \nregimes,  and  disparities  in  economic  growth.  In  the  first  half  of  the \n20th  century,  labor  migration  within  the  region  was  substantial;  but \nin  the  second  half  of  the  century  the  onset  of  industrialization  and \nrapid  GDP  growth  in  some  Asian  economies  was  accompanied  by \nthe introduction of strict limits on foreign workers in many countries. \nToday  the  extent  of  labor  mobility  varies  considerably  across  Asia\u2019s \nsubregions:  it  remains  low  in  all  subregions  except\u2014technically\u2014\nCentral  Asia,  where  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  created  new \nnational borders that turned internal migrants into international ones.\n\nAround a third (56.5 million) of the world\u2019s 175 million migrants \nin 2000 came from Asia and the Pacific. Over a third of those (almost \n21 million people) had moved within the region, as Table 2.8 shows, \n\nTable 2.8.

Only 8 million non-Asian migrants live \nin the region. Overall, many more people have moved away from Asia \nto the rest of the world than have migrated in the opposite direction. \n\nLooking  at  migration  as  a  share  of  population  gives  a  better \nidea  of  its  significance  (Table  2.9).  Emigrants  from  Central  Asian \ncountries were equivalent to 16.5% of their population in 2000, while \nimmigrants were 8%. In contrast, outbound migrants were equivalent \nto only 1.7% of Southeast Asia\u2019s population, 1.5% of South Asia\u2019s, and \n0.6% of Northeast Asia\u2019s. Emigration was much higher, at almost 9%, \nin  the  Pacific.16  Migrants  within  Central  Asia  account  for  2.3%  of  the \npopulation,  a  share  similar  to  that  in  the  EU.  Undoubtedly,  official \nfigures  underestimate  labor  mobility  in  Asia  as  they  fail  to  capture \nunreported  or  illegal  migration.  Seasonal  labor,  which  is  significant, \nis also poorly captured by official statistics on international migration.\n\nOver  the  past  decade  Asian  workers  have  increasingly  been \non  the  move.  They  have  gone  abroad  in  search  of  better  economic \nconditions  and  opportunities,  often  within  the  region  itself,  attracted \nby fast economic growth (ADB 2008a). Recent studies suggest that at \nleast until the 2008/09 crisis labor migration from Indonesia to Malaysia \nand the Philippines was growing fast, as was the number of workers \nfrom Myanmar in Thailand, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines; from \nthe Republic of Korea in Japan and the PRC; and from the PRC in Hong \nKong,  China.  Labor  mobility  within  South  Asia  has  also  increased. \nEmpirical  studies  suggest  that  most  Central  Asian  migrants  work  in \nthe  Russian  Federation,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  Kazakhstan  (ADB \n2008a; Hugo 2008; Hugo and Young 2009). However, the onset of the \ncrisis in 2008 led to a sharp tightening of labor migration restrictions in \nmany  Asian  countries  and  the  departure  (forced  or  willing)  of  many \nlabor migrants who lost their jobs or were fired to make way for native \nworkers (Legrain 2010).\n\nUnfortunately,  specific  figures  on  intraregional  labor  mobility \nare  not  available,  but  data  on  remittances  from  foreign  workers  are \na  reasonable  proxy.  As  Figure  2.6  shows,  remittances  to  Asia  and  the \nPacific have soared, while outward remittances have also risen sharply. \nWhile some of this increase is due to improvements in data collection, \n\n15 \n\nImportantly, the figures in Tables 2.8 and 2.9 refer not to labor migration but to total migration, \nwhich includes non-worker as well as worker migrants.\n\n16  Emigration from many small Pacific islands is very high, but the regional average is lowered \nby Papua New Guinea, which is home to most of the population in the Pacific Islands but \nhas little emigration.\n\n40\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\nTable 2.9.

Remittance flows are also affected by a \nvariety of other factors, such as exchange rate moves and the pressure to \nsend more money home in times of crisis. Anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat  the  increase  in  remittances  from  South  Asian  workers  initially \ncame  mainly  from  jobs  on  infrastructure  projects  in  the  Middle  East. \nMore recently, the NIEs, Malaysia, and Thailand have attracted growing \nnumbers of Asian workers, especially from Southeast Asia\u2014at least until \n\nPanel A:\n\nInflows\n\n$ million\n\n75,000\n\n60,000\n\n45,000\n\n30,000\n\n15,000\n\n0\n\nSouth Asia\n\nSE Asia\n\nPacific\n\nCentral Asia\n\nOceania\n\nNE Asia\n\n42\n\n\fthe 2008/09 crisis (ADB 2008a; Sumulong and Zhai 2008; Hugo and Young \n2009). Japan is still reluctant to allow in foreign workers. As a share of \nGDP, remittances to South Asian countries were highest, while outflows \nfrom Southeast Asian countries were greatest (panel B of Figure 2.6).  \n\nTo recap, official figures suggest that labor mobility within Asia\u2019s \nsubregions  is  low,  except  within  Central  Asia  where  it  is  moderately \nhigh.  While  anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  labor  mobility  within \nSouth Asia is growing as job opportunities increase, good comparative \ndata are sorely lacking.\n\nOther studies have used different proxies, such as tourism flows, \nto  estimate  intraregional  labor  mobility.  These  generally  confirm  that \npeople-to-people  exchanges  have  increased  over  the  past  decade, \nespecially in Southeast Asia, and that tourism within Asia (as a share of \nAsians\u2019 total tourist trips) is gradually approaching the levels in the EU \nand  North  America  (Capannelli,  Lee,  and  Petri  2009).  Overall,  trends \nsuggest  that  labor  mobility  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  will  continue  to \nincrease. This creates a further rationale for closer regional cooperation, \nespecially  considering  the  large  potential  gains  from  increased  labor \nmobility (Rodrik 2002; Athukorala 2006; Legrain 2007; ADB 2008b).\n\n2.3. Financial Integration\n\nintegration  remains \n\nthe  development  of  regional  production  networks \n\nWhile \nis \nstrengthening  trade  and  investment  integration  across  East  Asia, \nlow  throughout  the  wider  Asian \nfinancial \nregion.  Decades  of  bank-dominated  financial  intermediation  and \ngovernment-directed  lending  have  left  domestic  financial  systems \nunderdeveloped. Unsurprisingly, Asian capital markets are still much \nmore strongly integrated with financial centers in the US and Europe \nthan with each other.  \n\nThe  1997/98  financial  crisis  exposed  Asia\u2019s  overreliance  on \npoorly regulated banking sectors and a lack of well-developed capital \nmarkets. East Asian authorities responded with collective initiatives to \nstrengthen  financial  integration,  with  the  aim  of  promoting  efficient \nfinancial  transactions  across  the  region,  diversifying  sources  of \nfunding,  and  providing  public  goods  such  as  financial  stability  and \ncrisis prevention measures. While these initiatives are starting to show \nresults,  the  region\u2019s  massive  savings  are  still  largely  intermediated \nthrough  financial  centers  outside  the  region  and  invested  in  low-\nyielding  foreign  assets,  reducing  the  efficiency  of  capital  allocation. \nAsia\u2019s lack of financial integration is also a constraint on financing the \n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n43\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 2.7.

Two broad \nmeasures of financial integration exist: price indicators and quantity-\nbased  ones  (Lee  2008).  When  assets  can  be  traded  freely  across  a \nregion,  prices  for  similar  assets  should  become  more  similar  (after \nadjusting for risks). In other words, greater financial integration should \nbe accompanied by a closer co-movement of prices. This, in turn, leads \nto a higher share of financial assets being traded within the region and \nheld by regional investors. \n\nPrice  convergence  can  be  measured  from  yields  on  financial \nassets.  Over  the  past  decade  the  variation  of  cross-market  yield \nspreads  between  long-term  government  bonds  and  US  Treasuries \nhas sharply declined, suggesting that financial integration in Asia has \ndeepened (Figure 2.7). Yield spreads spiked again as the global credit \ncrisis started in 2007, but have since declined somewhat. \n\n17  See Section 2.5 for a discussion on financing regional infrastructure projects and Section 2.8 \n\nfor a detailed analysis of regional financial cooperation.\n\n44\n\n\fFigure 2.8.

Asian equity \nmarkets have relatively high levels of foreign participation and remain \nvulnerable to sudden shifts in capital flows as well as developments in \nUS markets. Correlations between Asian and US stock markets have \nincreased  over  time,  while  those  between  individual  Asian  markets \nhave increased even more (ADB 2009a).\n\nAnother  price  indicator  of  financial  integration  is  the  extent  of \nco-movement of equity indexes, with +1 indicating a perfect positive \ncorrelation, 0 no correlation, and \u20131 a perfect negative correlation. A \ncomparison of share price indexes\u2019 bilateral correlations across Asian \nmarkets  before  and  after  the  1997/98  financial  crisis  and  after  the \n2008/09 crisis shows that they rose after both crises (Table 2.10). While \nthis may reflect growing links among most Asian stock markets via US \nor European markets, rather than greater regional financial integration, \nbilateral correlations among Asian equity markets are generally higher \n\n45\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nTable 2.10.

Indeed, 90% of correlations among Asian \nmarkets  increased  between  the  two  periods,  and  all  were  positive \nin  the  postcrisis  period,  suggesting  an  increase  in  regional  financial \nintegration.\n\nQuantity indicators also suggest that regional financial integration \nis increasing.18 Figure 2.9 details how cross-border portfolio holdings \nof  assets  and  liabilities  evolved  between  2001  and  2008.  Excluding \nJapan,  the  12  Asian  economies  for  which  data  are  available  held \n25% of their foreign assets within the region in 2008, up from 15% in \n2001.  If  Japan  is  included,  the  picture  changes  markedly.  As  Japan \nholds very few Asian assets (2% of its total foreign assets in 2008) and \ninvests heavily in the US (32% in 2008), when Japan is included, Asian \ncountries hold a mere 10% of cross-border assets within the region (up \nfrom 6% in 2001), while the share held in the US is almost three times \nas  much  (27%  in  2008,  down  from  34%  in  2001).  Interestingly,  both \nAsian  holdings  of  US  assets  and  US  holdings  of  Asian  ones  declined \n\n18  The data, which are from a portfolio investment survey started by the International Monetary \nFund in 2001, also shed some light on South and Central Asian countries where it is hard to \nfind data on the prices of financial assets.\n\n48\n\n\fin absolute terms between 2001 and 2008, and also as a share of GDP. \nUnfortunately, these figures for financial assets do not cover the PRC \nor  Taipei,China,  which  do  not  participate  in  the  assets  side  of  the \nsurvey. However, the figures on liabilities confirm the trend of low but \nincreasing financial integration suggested by the assets survey. Asian \neconomies\u2019 intraregional financial liabilities (including the PRC, Japan, \nand  Taipei,China)  increased  from  10%  of  the  total  in  2001  to  16%  in \n2008, with the US share declining from 37% to 33% of Asia\u2019s total.\n\nDetailed  statistics  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nsurvey (not shown in Figure 2.9) suggest that while portfolio investment \nwithin Asian subregions has mostly increased since 2001, the share that \nSoutheast Asian countries invest within the subregion has fallen. The \nsurvey  also  highlights  the  lack  of  financial  integration  within  Central \nand South Asia, as well as between them and the rest of Asia. Both are \nmore closely integrated with the US and other non-Asian countries. \n\nTo conclude, both price and quantity indicators show that financial \nintegration in Asia has generally risen in recent years but remains low. \nAsian financial markets are more integrated with global ones than with \neach other, especially when Japan is included. In part this is due to the \nunderdevelopment of various national markets and a lack of institutions. \nSeveral studies suggest that the low level of cross-border investments \nis  also  due  to  wide  disparities  in  income  levels  and  policy  variables \n(Eichengreen  and  Park  2003;  Eichengreen  and  Luengnaruemitchai \n2004).  To  improve  the  integration  of  the  region\u2019s  financial  markets, \nfinancial cooperation among Asian countries needs strengthening.\n\n2.4. Macroeconomic Convergence\n\nAs documented in the EAR and other studies, the 1997/98 Asian crisis \nled  to  increased  macroeconomic  interdependence  among  Asian \neconomies\u2014and  the  2008/09  global  crisis  may  do  so  too.  Output \ncorrelation  analysis  shows  that  the  co-movement  of  GDP  across \nAsia  has  increased  considerably  and  business  cycles  of  the  region\u2019s \neconomies have become more synchronized. Income gaps between \nAsian  economies  have  also  narrowed  sharply:  the  gap  between  the \nrichest and poorest countries, although still very high, has decreased \nmuch faster than in other regions of the world.\n\nIncreasing  trade  and  (to  a  lesser  extent)  financial  integration  \namong Asian economies should make their reaction to macroeconomic \nshocks  more  similar.  Also,  because  Asian  economies  remain  largely \ndependent on exports of final goods to the US and Europe, a demand \nshock from either will tend to affect Asian economies in a similar way. \n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n49\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBusiness  cycles  across  the  region  may  thus  become  increasingly \nsynchronized (ADB 2008b).\n\nFigure  2.10  shows  the  results  of  an  output  correlation  exercise \nconducted for India and 10 East Asian economies for which quarterly \nGDP  figures  are  available,  as  well  as  for  the  EU  and  the  US.19  The \nresults,  which  are  tailored  to  update  a  similar  analysis  conducted \nin  the  EAR  study  (ADB  2008b),  indicate  that  the  output  correlation \namong  Asian  economies  has  increased  considerably  over  the  past \ndecade.  It  was  negative  until  the  early  1990s,  and  has  averaged \n0.5\u20130.75  since  1997.  Although  the  sharp  increase  in  the  correlation \nsince  1997  largely  coincides  with  the  1997/98  crisis  and  its  impact \non  the  real  economy,  the  average  correlation  both  before  and  after \nthe  crisis  rose  considerably.  In  other  words,  Asian  economies  have \nbecome much more interdependent\u2014indeed, their macroeconomic \ninterdependence,  measured  by  GDP  correlation  coefficients,  is  now \ncomparable to that of the EU.20\n\nFigure 2.10 (panel B) charts the extent of East Asia\u2019s and India\u2019s \ninterdependence  with  the  EU  and  the  US.  The  results  confirm  the \nfindings of the EAR study. In particular, East Asian countries tend to be \nhighly interdependent with the US and Europe, their major economic \npartners, as well as with each other. In other words, there is no sign \nof  a  macroeconomic  \u201cdecoupling\u201d  of  Asia  from  the  US  and  EU.  The \ninterdependence  between  East  Asia  and  India  has  also  risen  and  is \nnow  similar  to  that  between  East  Asia  and  the  EU  and  US,  although \ncaution is needed in reading too much into such statistical results.21\n\nAnother  measure  of  macroeconomic  interdependence  is  the \ndegree of convergence of regional incomes. Whereas in 1990 the richest \ncountry in Asia and the Pacific had a GDP per capita 363 times greater \nthan  that  of  the  poorest,  the  gap  narrowed  to  a  (still  huge)  94  times \n\n19  Due to data limitations, the correlation analysis covered only 10 East Asian economies plus \nIndia and the first 15 EU members. Correlations are calculated using the natural logarithm \nof quarterly GDP data in local currencies and applying the Baxter-King method to derive the \ndata cyclical component by filtering the data for short-term fluctuations and the long-term \ntrend. A 12-quarter moving average is applied for the calculation, while the weights for \nindividual economies are computed using nominal GDP values. Data are available from the \nfirst quarter of 1987 until the first quarter of 2009, but as the filter drops the last 12 quarters, \nresults are shown until the end of 2007.\n\n20  Other recent studies have also shown that in the past decade the degree of macroeconomic \n\ninterdependence between East Asian economies and the US, as well as with the EU, \nhas increased, suggesting that East Asian economies have increased their intraregional \ninterdependence as well as their interdependence with the rest of the world (Capannelli, \nLee, and Petri 2009).\n\n21  Caution is needed in interpreting these results as standard measures of correlation tend to \nrise when volatility rises (Rigobon 1999).

The gap between the three richest and \nthe  three  poorest  more  than  halved  from  190  times  to  88  times  over \nthe same period. The gap is decreasing particularly fast in integrating \nsubregions such as Northeast and Southeast Asia, while it has increased \nin South and Central Asia (albeit from a much lower level). \n\nWhile inequality in East Asia is narrowing as poorer economies grow \nrapidly, inequality within countries has increased as some people profit \nmuch more from rapid economic growth than others, as discussed in \nthe EAR study (ADB 2008b). Such inequalities can be addressed, at least \npartially, through regional cooperation, as the EU\u2019s experience shows.\n\n52\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\n2.5. Infrastructure and Connectivity\n\nintegration, \n\nfacilitate  connectivity,  and \n\nDeveloping  regional  infrastructure  is  important  in  order  to  foster \neconomic \nlink  Asia\u2019s \nsubregions.  Regional  connectivity  has  always  been  a  major  factor \nin  economic,  social,  cultural,  and  political  development;  as  the \nworld economy becomes more globalized, it is also an increasingly \nimportant  source  of  comparative  advantage  (Krugman  1991).  Yet \nimprovements  in  infrastructure  have  not  kept  pace  with  growing \ndemand,  creating  a  huge  financing  gap,  especially  in  developing \ncountries. \n\nMeeting Asia\u2019s massive national and regional infrastructure needs \nrequires huge investment\u2014as much as $8 trillion between 2010 and \n2020, according to the Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia study (ADB/\nADBI  2009).  However,  the  backlog  of  pending  projects  is  large  and \ngrowing throughout the region. The 2008/09 crisis, which reduced the \navailability of private investment, has exacerbated these concerns. \nfor  \nThe  Global  Competitiveness  Report  prepared  annually \nthe  World  Economic  Forum  includes  infrastructure  development  as \none  of  the  four  basic  requirements  for  countries  to  be  competitive \ninternationally.22 This suggests that Asia is lagging behind other more \nadvanced  regions,  as  business  leaders  surveyed  for  the  report  rated \nthe quality of Asia\u2019s infrastructure as well below the G7 average. \n\nWhile such findings are inevitably highly subjective, they suggest \nthat in 2008 air transport in Asia was closest to G7 levels, while electricity \nsupply  lagged  furthest  behind.  Among  Asia\u2019s  subregions,  Northeast \nAsia has the best infrastructure, while South Asia\u2019s is rated lowest. Ports \nand railways are highly developed in Northeast Asia, while road links \nin South and Central Asia are particularly poor. Table 2.12 summarizes \nthe results at the subregional level, while country details are shown in \nTable A2.2 in the Appendix to this chapter.\n\nA  closer  assessment  of  Asia\u2019s  regional  infrastructure  can  be \nattempted  using  World  Bank  data.  Quantity  measures  (Figure  2.11, \npanels A1 and A2) indicate that South Asia is the subregion with the \nhighest road and rail density, although this still lags well behind the EU. \nAdjusting for population size, Central Asia has the most extensive rail \nnetwork. \n\n22  The others are institutions, macroeconomic stability, and health and primary education.\n\n53\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nTable 2.12.

The results, shown in panels B1 and B2 of \nFigure  2.11,  indicate  that  Northeast  Asia  ranks  highest  among  Asia\u2019s \nsubregions and not far behind the EU, while the Pacific is lowest. The \ngap between Asia\u2019s subregions and the EU is narrower in areas such \nas  timeliness,  but  remains  more  pronounced  in  terms  of  the  overall \nquality of transport and trade-related infrastructure.\n\nAs  these  figures  confirm,  boosting  intraregional  connectivity  is \nnot simply a matter of building physical infrastructure; it also requires  \nhigh-quality  connections,  modern  transport  and  logistics  systems, \nefficient  customs  systems,  and  proper \ninstitutions  to  facilitate \nconnectivity  across  Asian  economies.  Regional  cooperation  needs \nto  focus  on  both  hard  (physical)  and  soft  (institutional)  aspects  of \nregional  infrastructure,  and  in  particular  on  creating  links  between \nAsia\u2019s subregions.\n\nKuroda,  Kawai,  and  Nangia  (2008)  discuss  the  importance  of \ninfrastructure  for  promoting  regional  cooperation  and  integration  in \nAsia.  The  authors  argue  that  because  the  region\u2014particularly  East \nAsia\u2014has  become  a  dominant  part  of  international  and  regional \nproduction  networks  and  supply  chains,  its  competitiveness  needs \n\n54\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\nFigure 2.11.

The  need  to  reduce  transport  and  logistics  costs,  by \nconnecting  production  clusters  in  different  countries  and  linking \nthese clusters with markets, will be a major challenge in the next few \ndecades. \n\nThe development of regional infrastructure has a direct impact on \nproductivity and trade: creating and strengthening economic corridors \ngenerates  considerable  benefits  for  the  regional  economy,  not  least \nby  reducing  trade  costs  and  attracting  FDI.  The  Infrastructure  for  a \nSeamless Asia study discussed the role of regional infrastructure and \nits  potential  impact  on  the  creation  of  regional  production  networks \n(ADB/ADBI 2009). \n\nTwo  programs  for  regional  transport  networks  that  have  been \npromoted  since  the  1950s  by  the  United  Nations  (UN)  Economic \nand  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (ESCAP)\u2014the  Asian \nHighway  and  the  Trans-Asian  Railway\u2014provide  a  framework  for \nplanning and prioritizing connectivity in the region. The Asian Highway \nis  a  transport  initiative,  covering  142,000  kilometers  of  roads  passing \nthrough 32 countries, that aims to develop and improve road transport \ninfrastructure  to  promote  trade  and  tourism  and,  in  turn,  Asia\u2019s \neconomic and social development. The Trans-Asian Railway network, \ncomprising about 114,000 kilometers of railways in 28 countries, spans \nAsia, providing connections to Europe and offering links to major ports \nwhich provide sea access to landlocked countries, either directly or in \ncombination  with  highways.  Although  significant  progress  has  been \nmade,  major  investment  is  required  to  complete  and  upgrade  the \ntwo networks and enhance their hardware, as well as to implement \nrelated software components such as trade facilitation through cross-\nborder customs agreements.\n\nRegional  cooperation  is  also  essential  in  the  energy  sector\u2014to \nconnect  markets,  address  energy  security  concerns,  and  promote \nenergy efficiency. While each country has distinct energy needs and \nresources,  integrated  regional  planning  would  permit  cost-effective \nand  environmentally  sustainable  regional  projects  and  lead  to  a \nwider  energy  market.  While  there  are  obstacles  to  regional  energy \nintegration\u2014such  as  the  technical  incompatibility  of  transmission \nlines\u2014recent  projects \ninclude  the  export  of  natural  gas  from \nIndonesia to Singapore, and hydropower projects in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  that  sell  energy  to  Thailand.  The \npotential  for  additional  projects  is  large,  especially  in  South  Asia, \nwhere  hydroelectric  and  natural  gas  resources  are  dispersed  and  a \nmore integrated energy system could generate large savings. Securing \n\n56\n\n\fagreement on bankable projects and negotiating their implementation \nremain a challenge, however.23 \n\nAsia\u2019s infrastructure needs are so great that the public sector alone \nwill struggle to fund them; private sector finance is also vital. However, \nthe availability of private finance for infrastructure projects fluctuates \nwidely. Private participation is important not only for project financing, \nbut also to enhance the efficiency of infrastructure service provision. \nTo  promote  such  participation,  which  experts  estimate  could  cover \naround  20%  of  total  infrastructure  investment,  sector-level  reforms \nare  needed  to  create  an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory  environment \n(ADB/ADBI  2009).  In  addition,  deeper  and  wider  financial  markets, \nboth  domestic  and  regional,  are  required  to  help  fund  bankable \ninfrastructure  projects.  But  since  reforms  and  market  developments \ntake  time,  in  the  short  run,  regional  infrastructure  will  likely  have  to \nbe  funded  largely  by  the  public  sector,  complemented  by  domestic \nsavings where possible.\n\n2.6. Free Trade Agreements\n\nCountries in Asia and the Pacific have traditionally liberalized their trade \nunilaterally  or  through  multilateral  negotiations  at  the  World  Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and its predecessor, the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT). In general, they have lowered their barriers \nto trade and investment faster than countries in other regions. But over \nthe  past  decade  or  so,  with  progress  at  the WTO  stalled  and  the  US \nand EU rushing to conclude preferential agreements around the world, \nAsian governments have negotiated a panoply of trade and investment \nagreements with countries inside and outside the region. \n\nThe  recent  history  of  efforts  to  increase  trade  and  investment \ncooperation  in  the  region  can  be  broadly  divided  into  five  phases.24 \nThe first phase, from 1960 to 1967, was mainly Japanese-led (Kojima \n1971),  and  at  its  core  was  a  proposal  for  a  Pacific  Free  Trade  Area \n(PAFTA). PAFTA was to have five members: Australia, Canada, Japan, \nNew  Zealand,  and  the  US.  It  was  motivated  by  Japan\u2019s  growing \nrecognition  of  the  Pacific  region\u2019s  importance  for  its  economic \ngrowth,  and  was  also  a  response  to  the  creation  of  the  European \n\n23  The study shows that in present value terms nearly $200 billion, or 19%, of total energy costs \ncould be saved over the next two decades if the energy sector were integrated across the \nGreater Mekong Subregion and optimal use were made of its well-diversified resource base.\n\n24  For a historical overview of economic cooperation in the region, see Petri (1993).\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n57\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nEconomic  Community.  But  the  relatively  small  number  of  countries \nin the proposed grouping and, more importantly, their general lack of \nenthusiasm for PAFTA proved insurmountable obstacles. In particular, \nopinion in the US did not favor such a potentially discriminatory free \ntrade agreement (FTA) (Drysdale 1988).  \n\nThe  second  phase,  between  1967  and  1977,  saw  a  variety \nof  proposals  and  initiatives.  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines, \nSingapore,  and  Thailand  formed  ASEAN  in  1967.  During  this  initial \nphase,  ASEAN  was  mostly  a  consensus-based  politico-security \ncommunity  and  paid  little  attention  to  economic  issues.  Although \nASEAN  adopted  a  preferential  trading  arrangement  (PTA)  at  its  Bali \nsummit in 1976, this had little impact on regional trade because of its \nnarrow  commodity  coverage  and  half-hearted  implementation  (Ariff \n1994; Athukorala and Menon 1997). \n\nThe Pacific Basin Economic Committee (PBEC) was also formed \nin  1967.  The  PBEC,  which  was  much  less  institutionalized,  was \nbasically  a  private  business-oriented  organization  that  grew  out  of \nAustralian\u2013Japanese commercial cooperation. It was mainly a vehicle \nfor creating personal and information networks in the region. While the \ntheme of the first Pacific Trade and Development Conference was the \nfuture of PAFTA, support for it was soon abandoned in favor of a less \ninstitutionalized  and  more  issue-specific  problem-solving  approach \n(Higgott, Cooper, and Bonnor 1991). This was formalized in a proposal \nfor the creation of the Organization for Pacific Trade and Development \n(OPTAD), modeled on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD), to provide a forum for regional discussion, airing \ngrievances, and promoting understanding of economic transformation \nin the region (Drysdale and Patrick 1979). OPTAD was also expected \nto  provide  a  forum  to  assist  in  the  management  of  the  increasingly \ncomplex  US\u2013Japan  relationship  (Drysdale  1988).  Even  though  it  was \nmuch less ambitious than PAFTA, OPTAD was never established.\n\nThe  third  phase,  from  1978  to  1988,  saw  the  formation  of  the \nPacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) in 1980. PECC drew \non many of the ideas of OPTAD and proposed a tripartite institutional \nforum  (with  government,  business,  and  academic  components) \nfor  regional  economic  cooperation.  It  was  also  a  loose  institutional \nsetting  that  functioned  through  informal  consultative  meetings  and \npurpose-specific taskforces. Its major achievements were developing a \n\u201cPacific perspective\u201d on trade and development issues and facilitating \nthe  exchange  of  information  and  networking  on  issues  of  regional \neconomic  significance.  PECC,  which  has  a  secretariat  in  Singapore, \nbrought  in  ASEAN  countries  as  members,  as  well  as  the  PRC  and \n\n58\n\n\fTaipei,China.  The  only  regional  FTA  established  during  this  period \nwas the closer economic relations (CER) pact between Australia and \nNew Zealand, which came into force on 1 January 1983. Unlike most \nFTAs,  the  CER  automatically  included  all  goods  traded  between  the \ntwo countries unless specifically excluded, thus making it one of the \nmost comprehensive trading agreements in the world.  \n\nThe  fourth  phase,  from  1989  to  1999,  saw  the  establishment  in \n1989 of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the culmination of \ndecades of effort to bring about regional economic cooperation in the \nAsia-Pacific region.25  In 1992 ASEAN leaders agreed, through the ASEAN \nFree Trade Area (AFTA), to establish an ASEAN free trade area by 2007. \nThis  deadline  was  subsequently  brought  forward  to  2005.  The  main \nmechanism for realizing AFTA was the common effective preferential \ntariff (CEPT) scheme. The CEPT, which is basically sectoral, provided \nmore  comprehensive  product  coverage  than  previous  attempts  at \nliberalization that employed an item-by-item approach. \n\nThe fifth, ongoing phase, which began around 1999, has witnessed \na  dramatic  proliferation  of  FTAs  in  the  region.  Every  country  in  Asia \nand the Pacific, except Mongolia and Timor-Leste, is now a member \nof  at  least  one  FTA.  Figure  2.12  illustrates  how  the  number  of  FTAs \ninvolving at least one country from the Asia-Pacific region has soared \nsince 1990\u2014and even more so after 2000\u2014to reach 221 by the end of \nJanuary 2010. Of those 221, 112 have already been concluded, another \n60 are under negotiation, and 49 more have been proposed. \n\nThe proliferation of FTAs over the past decade has largely taken \nthe  form  of  bilateral  trade  agreements  (BTAs),  which  numbered \n42  in  1999  and  195  in  January  2010.  More  than  half  of  these  BTAs\u2014\nwhether concluded, being negotiated, or proposed\u2014involve a partner \noutside Asia and the Pacific. Such deals can scarcely be described as \npromoting regional cooperation. \n\nA  breakdown  of  FTAs  by  country  reveals  that  Singapore  has \nconcluded  most  (34),  followed  by  India  (33),  and  Pakistan  (26), \nas  Table  2.13  details.  Most  FTAs  involving  India  or  Pakistan  have  yet \nto  be  concluded,  however.  Of  the  FTAs  that  have  been  signed  or \nimplemented,  Singapore  tops  the  list  with  20,  followed  by  Japan, \nThailand, and India with 11 each. \n\nEast  Asian  countries  have  been  very  active  in  establishing  links \nwith  countries  outside  the  region.  Among  South  Asian  countries, \nIndia and Pakistan have actively pursued FTAs with countries outside \n\n25  APEC is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4.\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n59\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 2.12.

Australia, and New Zealand \nFree Trade Agreement (AANZFTA), both of which came into force on \n1 January 2010. The ASEAN-PRC FTA is the largest trade agreement in \nAsia in terms of population coverage, and the third largest in terms of \ntrading  volume,  while  the  AANZFTA  is  described  as  the  single  most \ncomprehensive  economic  agreement  among  its  members.  Another \nrecently signed preferential agreement which is of great significance \nfor  boosting  not  only  trade  but  also  economic  and  political  relations \nmore generally is the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement \nconcluded on 29 June 2010 between the PRC and Taipei,China. \n\nWith  key  ASEAN+1  agreements  in  place,  and  with  emerging \ndiscussions  on  the  creation  of  a  \u201cPlus  Three\u201d  FTA  among  the  PRC, \nJapan,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Asia\u2019s  trade  policy  cooperation  is \nfocusing on three proposals: an East Asia free trade agreement among \nASEAN+3 countries; a comprehensive economic partnership in East \nAsia involving all East Asia Summit members; and a free trade area of \nthe Asia-Pacific designed for APEC members (Bergsten 2007).26\n\nThe creation of a tangled web of overlapping BTAs and PTAs has \ncreated a \u201cspaghetti-bowl\u201d\u2014or \u201cAsian noodle-bowl\u201d\u2014effect, whereby \ninconsistencies between agreements are potentially raising the costs \nof doing business as well as the welfare losses associated with trade \ndiversion.  These  inconsistencies  include  different  schedules  for \nphasing out tariffs, different rules of origin, exclusion lists, conflicting \nstandards, and differences in rules dealing with anti-dumping and other \nregulations  and  policies  (Pangestu  and  Scollay  2001).  This  noodle-\nbowl  effect  may  explain  why  the  private  sector  is  not  exploiting  the \nfull potential benefit associated with FTAs, as their value from a cost\u2013\nbenefit perspective remains questionable, although recent studies find \nthat the rate of FTA utilization in Asia is increasing (Chia 2010; Kawai \nand Wignaraja forthcoming).27\n\nBoth  intuition  and  empirical  research  confirm  that  the  wider \nand  deeper  FTAs  are\u2014that  is,  the  closer  they  resemble  a  global, \nmultilateral deal\u2014the greater the benefits of trade creation will be and \nthe smaller the costs of trade diversion (Kawai and Wignaraja 2008; \nHill and Menon 2008). Their net impact depends on their design and \nimplementation,  which  are  shaped  by  the  underlying  motivation  for \npursuing them, as Box 2.4 explains.\n\n26  This proposal builds on the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement, which \nwas signed by Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore in 2005, and which \nAustralia, Peru, the United States, and Viet Nam are now considering joining.\n\n27  The Japan External Trade Organization conducts an annual survey on Japanese firms\u2019 \ninternational operations, which includes an assessment of the FTA utilization rate. The \nsurvey results suggest that the actual utilization rate is low, but increasing over time.  \nwww.jetro.go.jp/en/news/releases/20100318389-news\n\n64\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\nBox 2.4. Factors Driving the Proliferation of Free Trade Agreements in Asia\n\nW hy have free trade agreements (FTAs)\u2014\n\nespecially  bilateral  trade  agreements \n(BTAs)\u2014become so popular in recent \nyears? One important reason is Asian governments\u2019 \ndisenchantment with the pace of progress of trade \nand  investment  liberalization  at  the  multilateral \nlevel,  notably  the  deadlock  in  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  Doha  Round.  This  has  been \ncompounded by a kind of snowballing or domino \neffect (Baldwin 1996), with countries not wanting \nto be left behind in this apparent race. While these \ngeneral  factors  motivate  most  (if  not  all)  FTAs,  at \nleast one additional specific motivation is typically \nalso involved (Menon 1997). \n\nSector-driven.  FTAs  are  motivated  mainly \nby a desire to liberalize (or protect) one or a few \nkey  sectors.  They  are  sector-expanding  if  they \nseek  to  liberalize  sectors  or  areas  previously \nignored  at  the  multilateral  level.  These  are  often \ndescribed  as  \u201cWTO-plus\u201d  or  \u201cnew  age\u201d  FTAs. \nThe  United  States\u2013Singapore  BTA  is  one  such \nexample. FTAs can also be sector-excluding when \nthey are designed to exclude sensitive sectors or \nissues, often agriculture and services. An example \nis  the  Japan\u2013Singapore  Economic  Partnership \nAgreement. While Japan has long resisted joining \nplurilateral  trade  agreements  (PTAs)  because  of \nits  reluctance  to  liberalize  its  agricultural  sector, \nthe absence of a significant agricultural sector in \nthe  city-state  of  Singapore  facilitated  the  signing \nof this BTA.\n\nMarket  access.  FTAs  can  either  restore  or \ncreate  new  markets.  Market-restoring  BTAs  seek \nto restore trade links that existed prior to a trading \npartner  joining  an  FTA.  They  often  involve  a \ntraditional  trade  partner  outside  Asia  with  which \n\ntrade links had been weakened after one or both of \nthe parties had joined a relatively integrated FTA. \nThey  are  designed  to  bypass,  or  at  least  reduce, \ndiscriminatory  treatments.  Market-creating  FTAs \nusually  involve  countries  seeking  to  strengthen \ntheir trade and investment relations. \n\nPTA-based  BTAs  are  a  third  category  of \nFTA.  PTA-facilitating  agreements  are  designed \nto hasten integration between a country seeking \nto  join  a  PTA  and  a  member  of  that  PTA.  One \nexample  is  the  India\u2013Thailand  BTA,  which  helps \nIndia to strengthen ties with the ASEAN Free Trade \nArea (AFTA). PTA-integrating agreements are BTAs \nbetween members of an existing PTA. Examples \ninclude  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic\u2013\nViet  Nam  BTA  and  the  Singapore\u2013Thailand  BTA, \nwhere all countries are also members of AFTA. \n\nSince  most  sector-expanding  FTAs  pursue \nliberalization beyond that of the WTO, they have \nthe potential to deliver the biggest net gains to the \nsignatories.  Market-access  FTAs  come  second\u2014\nalthough  if  a  deal  is  riddled  with  exclusions  and \nambiguities,  this  may  undermine  its  benefits \nto  the  parties  involved.  The  net  effect  of  sector-\nexcluding FTAs can be negative, to the extent that \nthey slow the liberalization of sensitive sectors.\n\nExcept  perhaps  for  sector-expanding  ones, \nalmost  every  FTA  is  likely  to  produce  second-\nbest results compared to unilateral or multilateral \nliberalization. Even if an FTA delivers net benefits \nto  signatories,  second-round  effects  such  as \nretaliatory  or  other  feedback  effects  need  to  be \nconsidered. If the proliferation of FTAs undermines \nefforts  to  conclude  a  multilateral  deal\u2014and, \nindeed,  an  Asia-wide  FTA\u2014their  indirect  costs \nmay outweigh any country-level benefits.\n\n65\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n2.7. Macroeconomic and Financial \nCooperation\n\nThe  1997/98  financial  crisis  spurred  East  Asian  countries  to  enhance \ntheir macroeconomic and financial cooperation.28 Regional initiatives \naim  to  ensure  rapid  and  sustained  economic  growth  by  promoting \nmacroeconomic  stability,  protecting  against  the  recurrence  of  short-\nterm liquidity and currency crises, strengthening banking supervision \nand market regulation, and developing the region\u2019s financial markets \nto  help  recycle  regional  savings  into  regional  investments.  Indirectly, \nthese  initiatives  are  expected  to  boost  efforts  to  reduce  poverty  and \nimprove income inequality across and within countries in the region. \nWhile national economic policies remain the main official vehicles \nfor pursuing growth and stability, the need for regional macroeconomic \nand  financial  cooperation  has  increased  as  Asia\u2019s  economies  have \nbecome more interdependent. As the region\u2019s trade and financial links \nexpand, internal and external shocks propagate faster through various \ntransmission channels, creating a rationale for regional macroeconomic \npolicy cooperation to contain the costs of negative shocks and maximize \nthe benefits of positive ones (ADB 2008b).\n\nEconomic Review and Policy Dialogue\nAn  important  mechanism  for  macroeconomic  policy  cooperation \nestablished  in  May  2000  by  ASEAN+329  finance  ministers  is  the \nEconomic Review and Policy Dialogue (ERPD).30 Part of the ASEAN+3 \nFinance  Ministers\u2019  Process,  the  ERPD  is  an  intergovernmental  forum \nthat  aims  to  strengthen  regional  policy  dialogue  and  collaboration \non  a  broad  range  of  issues,  including  economic  policies,  financial \nregulation,  financial  market  infrastructure  development,  structural \neconomic reforms, and economic and financial surveillance, including \nthe  development  of  a  regional  early  warning  system  to  assess  and \nmonitor  financial  vulnerabilities.  In  particular,  the  ERPD  assesses \nglobal, regional, and national economic conditions; monitors regional \n\n28  More recently, South Asian countries have also started a dialogue on macroeconomic and \n\nfinancial cooperation, although the process is still in an embryonic form.\n\n29  ASEAN+3 includes the 10 members of ASEAN (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam), plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.\n30  Before the ERPD was introduced, the finance ministers of the 10 ASEAN members had \n\nalready created their own surveillance process in 1998 to strengthen their policy dialogue \nin the monetary, fiscal, and financial fields. The ASEAN Surveillance Process is coordinated \nby a unit established within the ASEAN Secretariat.\n\n66\n\n\flimited \n\nthrough \n\nCooperation \n\ncapital  flows  and  currency  markets;  analyzes  macroeconomic  and \nfinancial risks; looks at how to strengthen banking and financial system \nconditions;  and  can  give  East  Asia  a  unified  voice  in  discussions  on \nreforming the international financial system (ADB 2009a).\nis  still  mostly \n\nto \nthe  ERPD \ninformation exchange. There is little or no discussion on the adoption \nof  common  regimes  or  binding  policy  coordination  agreements. \nSharing  information  among  regional  peers  through  dialogue  and \nmacroeconomic  monitoring  is  a  first  and  necessary  step  for  policy \ncooperation:  it  helps  improve  each  country\u2019s  understanding  of \nmacroeconomic and structural issues, economic and financial trends \nand  challenges,  and  policy  options.  Deeper  cooperation  requires \nagreement  on  new  regimes,  such  as  adopting  harmonized  regional \nstandards. Eventually, as the costs and benefits of cooperation become \nclearer, authorities may find merit in pooling their sovereignty through \nfull policy coordination (Kawai and Takagi 2005).\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s Bond Markets\nASEAN+3 finance ministers have made some progress towards setting \nregional standards through the adoption of two major initiatives under \nthe  ERPD:  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI)  and  the  Chiang \nMai Initiative (CMI). The ABMI aims to help develop East Asia\u2019s local-\ncurrency  bond  markets  and  deploy  the  region\u2019s  huge  savings  for \nregional investments. The CMI seeks to shield East Asian economies \nfrom the recurrence of currency and liquidity crises such as the one \nthat  hit  the  region  in  1997/98.  The  development  of  East  Asia\u2019s  bond \nmarkets is also being fostered by the introduction of two Asian Bond \nFunds (ABFs) by  the  Executives\u2019 Meeting  of  East Asia Pacific Central \nBanks (EMEAP), as Box 2.5 explains.\n\nDeveloping  local-currency  bond  markets  is  very  important  to \nincrease  the  resilience  of  national  financial  systems  to  economic \nshocks. The impact of the 1997/98 crisis would have been less severe \nif the region\u2019s companies had been able to tap well-developed local-\ncurrency bond markets rather than borrowing in foreign currencies or \nrelying on bank loans. Developing Asia\u2019s local-currency bond markets \nhas  since  become  a  policy  priority.  Along  with  domestic  regulatory \nreforms, the ABMI and ABFs31 have boosted East Asia\u2019s local-currency \n\n31  The launch of the ABFs may have inspired multilateral agencies to introduce similar funds \nin other emerging markets. For example, the World Bank launched the Global Emerging \nMarkets Local Currency Bond Fund as part of its strategy to develop bond markets in \ndeveloping countries by opening them up to foreign investors, thereby providing an \nadditional source of local financing.\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n67\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBox 2.5. Regional Cooperation Initiatives to Develop East Asia\u2019s Bond Markets\n\nIn  2003  East  Asian  authorities  launched  two \n\nimportant  policy  initiatives\u2014the  Asian  Bond \nMarkets  Initiative  (ABMI)  and  the  Asian  Bond \nFunds  (ABFs)\u2014to  foster  the  development  of \nbond  markets  denominated  in  local  currencies \nand channel the region\u2019s vast savings to its growing \ninvestment needs more effectively.  \n\nAsian Bond Markets Initiative \n\n\u2022  Supporting \n\ninstitution: \n\nAssociation \n\nof \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  plus  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Japan, and the Republic of \nKorea (ASEAN+3) Finance Ministers\u2019 Process \nunder  the  Economic  Review  and  Policy \nDialogue (ERPD).\n\n\u2022  Aim:  Promoting  domestic  reforms  to  help \nexpand the size of national and regional bond \nmarkets, attract regional and foreign investors, \nand strengthen bond markets\u2019 infrastructure. \n\u2022  Implementation:  In  the  first  five years  after \nthe  creation  of  the  ABMI,  specific  working \ngroups  addressed  the  issues  of  establishing  a \ncredit  guarantee  mechanism,  strengthening \ndomestic credit-rating agencies, disseminating \ninformation  on  national  and  regional  bond \nmarkets  and  policies,  assessing  the  feasibility \nof  a  regional  foreign  exchange  clearing  and \nsettlement system, and creating new securitized \ndebt instruments. AsianBondsOnline was also \n\ncreated to provide a one-stop market data and \ninformation portal for institutional investors. \n\nAsian Bond Funds\n\n\u2022  Supporting institution: Executives\u2019 Meeting of \nEast Asia Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP).\n\u2022  Aim:  Improving  the  attractiveness  of  the \n\nregion\u2019s bond markets. \n\n\u2022  Implementation:  The  first  Asian  Bond  Fund \n(ABF1)  pooled  $1  billion  of  international \nreserves  from  EMEAP  central  banks  and \nin  US$-denominated  sovereign \ninvested \nand  quasi-sovereign  debt  issued  in  eight \neconomies  (Hong  Kong,  China;  Indonesia; \nthe  Republic  of  Korea;  Malaysia; \nthe \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China;  the  Philippines; \nSingapore; and Thailand). The second Asian \nBond  Fund  (ABF2)  was  started  in  2005  with \nan investment of $2 billion in local-currency-\ndenominated  sovereign  and  quasi-sovereign \nissues  in  the  same  eight  EMEAP  markets. \nA further $2 billion has been allocated to the \nPan-Asian  Bond  Index  Fund,  which  invests \nin \nlocal-currency  sovereign  and  quasi-\nsovereign  bonds.  The  remainder  has  been \nallocated  to  eight  individual  market  funds \nthat  invest  in  their  respective  local-currency \nbond markets, including sovereign and quasi-\nsovereign issues.\n\nbond  markets  by  aligning  national  policies  with  international  best \npractices and facilitating a better understanding of how to overcome \nmarket impediments. As a result, capital markets in general now play \na larger role in East Asian countries\u2019 financial systems than a decade \nago (ADB 2008b).32 \n\n32  Recent data show that the bond market now accounts for around a third of financial \n\nintermediation in East Asian countries, up from a fifth in 1995. www.asianbondsonline \n.adb.org/\n\n68\n\n\fIn  May  2008  ASEAN+3  finance  ministers  launched  new  efforts  to \ndevelop deeper and more liquid local-currency debt markets by improving \nnational  regulatory  frameworks,  developing  market  infrastructure,  and \npromoting  the  issuance  of\u2014and  demand  for\u2014bonds  denominated  in \nlocal  currencies.  Other  moves  included  the  establishment  of  a  group \nof experts from the public and private sectors to look at the possibility \nof creating a regional settlement intermediary to enhance cross-border \nsettlement  infrastructure,  introducing  measures  to  harmonize  cross-\nborder regulations and strengthen domestic credit rating mechanisms, \nand creating a credit guarantee mechanism for local-currency bonds.\n\nCredit Guarantee and Investment Facility \nThe establishment of the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) \nis an important outcome of the ABMI that has been gradually developed \nsince 2005 through policy dialogue, close coordination, and collaboration \nbetween ASEAN+3 and ADB. At their annual meeting in May 2009 in Bali, \nASEAN+3 finance ministers endorsed the creation of a credit guarantee \nand  investment  mechanism  as  a  trust  fund  of  ADB.  The  establishment \nof  the  CGIF  trust  fund  was  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  in \nApril  2010,  with  an  initial  capital  of  $700  million.  ADB  will  contribute \n$130 million, Japan and the PRC $200 million each, the Republic of Korea \n$100 million, and the 10 ASEAN countries $7 million each.\n\nThe  CGIF  will  seek  to  promote  the  development  of  Asian  bond \nmarkets by providing guarantees for investors that make it easier for \nfirms  to  issue  local-currency  bonds  with  longer  maturities.  Longer \nterm,  it  is  expected  to  promote  the  harmonization  of  standards \nand  practices  for  bond  issuance  and  help  channel  Asia\u2019s  savings  to \nfinance long-term investment in local currencies, notably in regional \ninfrastructure and other key areas. This, in turn, will promote regional \nfinancial  market  integration,  make  Asia  less  vulnerable  to  external \nshocks, and boost economic growth.\n\nEmerging East Asia accounts for almost 7% of the local-currency \nbonds outstanding globally, up from only 2% at the end of 1996 (ADB \n2009a).  At  the  end  of  2009  the  PRC  accounted  for  around  4%  of  the \nglobal total, a bigger share than the United Kingdom (UK) and one that \ncompares  favorably  with  other  European  markets  such  as  Germany \nand France. Outstanding local-currency bonds in East Asia (excluding \nJapan) had a total value of $4.4 trillion (ADB 2010), and have more than \ntrebled since the ABMI\u2019s launch in 2003 (Figure 2.13).33\n\n33 \n\nIncluding Japan, the total size of the East Asian local-currency bond market was about \n$14 trillion in 2009.\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n69\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 2.13.

Government bonds account \nfor  70%  of  the  total.  Except  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  domestic \nmarket  for  government  bonds  is  larger  than  that  for  corporate  ones. \nIn 2009, however, corporate bond markets grew faster, largely due to \nthe rapid growth of the PRC market, while the Philippines, Viet Nam, \nIndonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia also registered substantial progress. \nCentral  bank  issuance\u2014which  in  2009  reached  $2  trillion,  or  60%  of \ngovernment bond issuance\u2014dominates bond markets, largely due to \nthe active management of capital flows.\n\nThe  development  of  local-currency  bond  markets  in  East  Asia \nremains uneven, however. The larger economies tend to have bigger \nbond markets (as well as well-capitalized banking systems). Some \ncountries\u2019 bond markets remain undercapitalized, as measured by \nthe  ratio  of  total  bonds  to  GDP.  East  Asian  governments\u2019  tendency \n\n\fto  run  fiscal  surpluses  before  the  2008/09  crisis\u2014while  laudable \nfrom  a  macroeconomic  perspective\u2014has  not  been  conducive \nto  developing  markets  for  government  bonds  (Eichengreen  and \nLuengnaruemitchai 2004).34\n\nCorporate  bond  markets  have  grown  rapidly  in  the  past  two \nyears. But with the notable exception of the Republic of Korea, they \nremain tiny throughout Asia for a number of reasons, including poor \ndisclosure  and  accounting  standards;  a  preference  for  investing  in \nequity markets; weak market infrastructure and related legal systems; \nthe large role played by commercial banks in corporate financing; and \na widespread perception that yields are low, as most corporate bond \nissuers are either entities that are government-owned or government-\nsupported,  or  private  sector  blue-chip  companies  (ADB  2009a). \nThe  absence  of  well-developed,  diverse  corporate  bond  markets \nconstrains  investors,  generating  a  demand  for  regional  initiatives  in \nthis area. \n\nWhile much still needs to be done, the region\u2019s local-currency bond \nmarkets have come a long way since the 1997/98 crisis. This success \ngives East Asian governments an incentive to address remaining market \nimpediments, including the need to reform tax structures, harmonize \nrules,  overcome  regulatory  obstacles,  strengthen  infrastructure,  and \ntighten  legal  frameworks.  Most  East  Asian  economies\u2014notably  the \nfour Asian economies hardest hit by the 1997/98 crisis (Indonesia, the \nRepublic of Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand)\u2014have reduced their \ncurrency  mismatches  over  the  past  decade.  As  a  result,  these  were \nmuch less of a problem during the 2008/09 crisis (Goldstein and Xie \n2009).  The  region\u2019s  local-currency  bond  markets  generally  showed \ngreat  resilience  during  the  2008/09  crisis:  they  played  a  key  role  in \nfinancing  fiscal  deficits  and  funding  domestic  companies  at  a  time \nwhen  liquidity  had  evaporated  from  global  markets.  As  Figure  2.14 \nshows, in 2008 issuance of local currency debt was steady in the main \nSoutheast Asian markets even as primary issuance in global markets \nplummeted.35 \n\nWhile  improved  policies  and  increased  issuance  have  boosted \nprimary  bond  markets,  liquidity  in  secondary  markets  remains  a \nconcern. A recent survey of investors by AsianBondsOnline found that \nparticipants in both government and corporate bond markets agreed \n\n34  Eichengreen, Hausmann, and Panizza (2003) also provide evidence that small size is the \nmost robust determinant of \u201coriginal sin\u201d\u2014the inability of emerging markets to borrow \nabroad in their own currencies.\nIssuance dipped, in particular, in Northeast Asian emerging economies.\n\n35 \n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n71\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 2.14.

Authorities  in  the  region  have  responded \nby considering the creation of an Asia financial stability dialogue (ADB \n2008b)  that  would  bring  together  officials  from  finance  ministries, \ncentral  bank  authorities,  and  other  supervisory  and  regulatory \nagencies  to  address  the  region\u2019s  financial  market  vulnerabilities  and \nregulations and engage in a dialogue with the private sector. After the \ncrisis abated and capital flowed back to Asia to take advantage of its \nstrong  growth  and  higher  asset  returns,  the  region\u2019s  authorities  are \nfacing the daunting challenge of how best to manage capital flows and \nreform financial regulation. \n\nCollectively, Asian countries now have a stronger voice in the newly \nestablished  Financial  Stability  Board  (which  replaced  the  Financial \n\n36  Another survey of ASEAN+3 countries\u2019 bond markets identified major obstacles to \n\ncross-border transactions as currency exchange restrictions; a lack of uniform rating \nrequirements; cash repatriation restrictions; withholding taxes; and investor registration \nprocesses (ADB 2009a).\n\n72\n\n\fStability Forum) as part of the discussions under the Group of Twenty \n(G20), which has been used as a major global forum to deal with the \n2008/09 crisis. By acting together, Asian economies could have a big \ninfluence on the G20 agenda. Capitalizing on its experience from the \n1997/98 crisis, Asia has an opportunity to contribute to the development \nof  common  regional  and  global  rules  that  limit  risky  activities  and \nimprove  cross-border  financial  regulation.  To  articulate  the  region\u2019s \nvoice  in  global  forums  more  effectively,  Asia  needs  to  strengthen  its \ninstitutional framework for regional economic cooperation\u2014as it has \ndone by multilateralizing the CMI.\n\nThe Chiang Mai Initiative and Its \nMultilateralization\nIn  the  aftermath  of  the  1997/98  crisis,  the  CMI  was  launched  by \nASEAN+3 finance ministers on the sidelines of ADB\u2019s annual meeting \nin  Chiang  Mai,  Thailand,  in  May  2000.  The  CMI  was  designed  to \nliquidity  problems  and  supplement  existing \naddress  short-term \ninternational  financial  arrangements  in  the  event  of  an  emergency. \nIt  initially  involved  an  expanded  ASEAN  Swap  Arrangement  (ASA)37 \ncovering  all  ASEAN  members,  together  with  a  network  of  bilateral \nswap agreements (BSAs) and repurchase facilities among ASEAN+3 \ncountries. The CMI also provides an institutional mechanism to pursue \nfurther  negotiations,  rather  than  simply  a  final  agreement  on  swap \narrangements.\nASEAN+3 \n\nin  2008  and  2009 \ntransformed  the  BSAs.  Ministers  decided  to  expedite  the  CMI \nMultilateralization (CMIM), and agreed that this should take the form \nof a collectively managed reserve-pooling arrangement governed by \na  single  contract,  thereby  reducing  costly  and  wasteful  duplication. \nASEAN would contribute 20% of the reserve pool, with Japan and the \nPRC  (including  Hong  Kong,  China)  each  contributing  32%  and  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  16%.  Finance  ministers  also  agreed  to  expand \nthe  pool  of  foreign  currency  reserves.  The  fund  has  grown  from \n$36.5 billion in 2001 to $84 billion in 2008 and $120 billion in May 2009. \n\nfinance  ministers\u2019  meetings \n\n37  Central banks and monetary authorities of the original five ASEAN members (Indonesia, \n\nMalaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) agreed to establish reciprocal currency \nor swap arrangements in August 1977. The ASA was created primarily to provide liquidity \nsupport for those experiencing balance-of-payments difficulties. The duration, coverage, \nand amount of the ASA have expanded markedly since its inception. Originally intended \nto be in place for only a year, the arrangement has been extended incrementally. The CMI \nexpanded the ASA to all 10 ASEAN members.\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n73\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nThe CMIM was signed by member countries in December 2009 and \nbecame effective in March 2010.38\n\nThe  maximum  amount  that  each  country  can  borrow  from  the \nCMIM  fund  is  based  on  its  contribution  multiplied  by  a  borrowing \nmultiplier which favors smaller economies. For example, the borrowing \nquota  of  Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and \nViet  Nam  is  five  times  their  contributions,  while  Hong  Kong,  China; \nIndonesia;  Malaysia;  Singapore;  and  Thailand  can  borrow  2.5  times \ntheir  contributions.  The  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  borrowing  multiplier  is \n1.0; for Japan and the PRC (not including Hong Kong, China), it is 0.5 \n(Table 2.14). Other details about voting rights, decision-making rules, \nand operational aspects such as the activation of short-term liquidity \nin the event of a sovereign financial emergency were also included in \nthe official statement released at the 2009 Bali meeting.39 \n\nThe  2009  Bali  agreement  is  a  particularly  important  step  for  the \ninstitutionalization  of  Asia\u2019s  financial  cooperation  because  ASEAN+3 \ncountries were able not only to decide their relative weights in financial \ncontributions and introduce a bias in favor of smaller economies, but \nalso  to  agree  to  adopt  a  flexible  decision-making  structure  to  bolster \nthe  fund\u2019s  effectiveness  and  prevent  any  of  the  Plus  Three  countries \nindividually, or ASEAN as a group, holding veto power. ASEAN+3 finance \nministers  agreed  that  only  decisions  on  fundamental  issues  (such  as \nreviews of membership, size, borrowing multipliers, terms of lending, \nand IMF conditionality ratios) require consensus, while lending issues \ncan  be  decided  through  a  simple  majority  but  in  a  weighted  voting \nsystem (linked to contributions), similar to that of the IMF. \n\nAt  their  April  2010  meeting,  ASEAN+3  finance  ministers  agreed \nto  establish  by  early  2011  an  independent  regional  surveillance  unit \nto monitor macroeconomic and financial conditions, detect emerging \nvulnerabilities, and support CMIM decision-making. They also agreed \n\n38  To be sure, the formal endorsement of the CMIM is the result of a three-year process that \nbegun with the creation of a taskforce to study the new mechanism. It was at ADB\u2019s 2007 \nannual meeting in Kyoto that ASEAN+3 finance ministers agreed in principle to establish \na single pool of reserves to replace some 15 bilateral currency swap agreements among \ncentral banks of the Plus Three countries and those of the five largest ASEAN economies. \nThe five ASEAN members that have signed BSAs under the CMI are Indonesia, Malaysia, \nthe Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. While Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam did not sign any BSAs with the PRC, Japan, or the Republic of \nKorea, they are part of the ASA, which was established in 1977 with an initial $100 million \nfacility. The ASA was activated by Indonesia in 1979, Malaysia and Thailand in 1980, and the \nPhilippines in 1981.\n\n39  For the full text, see www.asean.org/22536.htm\n\n74\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\nTable 2.14.

To assess borrowing countries\u2019 \ncapacity  to  meet  lenders\u2019  repayment  conditions,  the  institutional \ncapacity  to  exercise  due  diligence  is  also  needed.  If  government \npolicies  need  adjusting,  unconditional  financing  could  create  moral \nhazard  for  both  potential  borrowers  and  international  investors, \neven  when  it  does  not  harm  prospects  for  timely  repayment.  Only \nthrough  surveillance  can  a  lending  program  identify  the  appropriate \ncombination  of  financing  and  adjustment.  The  AMRO  will  allow  the \nCMIM  to  rely  more  on  its  own  assessments  when  making  lending \ndecisions\u2014about both  the  amount  and  any  conditionality\u2014reducing \nmoral  hazard  and  mitigating  concerns  that  problems  leading  to \nbalance-of-payments difficulties may require structural adjustments. \n\nHowever, the AMRO is not meant to replace the IMF, but to enhance \neconomic  monitoring,  supplementing  the  IMF,  especially  given  its \nnew  short-term  liquidity  facility,  which  enables  certain  countries  to \nborrow without conditions. Under the CMIM, a country can draw up \nto 20% of its quota for up to six months without being subject to IMF \nconditionality, while any amount over this limit would need to be tied \nto an IMF program. \n\nInstitutionally, the CMIM agreement sets a workable precedent for \naddressing other priority areas for regional cooperation. For example, \nenhanced intergovernmental dialogue has spurred further cooperation \nin  trade,  investment,  and\u2014importantly\u2014financial  supervision  and  \nregulation.  The  new  institutional  model  could  also  be  used  for \nspeeding up financial market development, for instance setting up a \nfund  to  invest  in  developing  regional  bond  markets,  and  thus  better \nuse of the region\u2019s huge savings to help finance its massive investment \nrequirements. \n\nThe CMIM governance structure could also be a model for tackling \nregional  public  goods  such  as  the  environment,  security,  disaster \npreparedness,  and  disease  prevention.  It  deepens  the  dialogue \nprocess, allows for a collegial approach to problem resolution, and acts \nas the foundation for building viable regional institutions. Despite the \nhuge economic diversity among members, their political differences, \n\n40  Until AMRO becomes fully operational, ASEAN+3 finance ministers have asked ADB and the \nASEAN Secretariat to work out an interim arrangement based on the existing surveillance \nprocess under the ERPD.\n\n76\n\n\fand their dependency on external economic links, the agreement on \nthe CMIM cements a commitment of ASEAN+3 countries to regional \ncooperation.\n\nThe  CMIM\u2019s  impact  on  the  region  will  depend  on  how  its \nmembership evolves. Once pressing operational issues are resolved, \nit could expand to include all East Asia Summit (EAS) members\u2014that \nis, add India, Australia, and New Zealand\u2014or indeed other countries \nin  the  region  too.  The  CMIM  could  also  eventually  add  new  crisis \nprevention functions.\n\nThe  CMIM\u2019s  success  depends  on  boosting  its  current  size.  In \nthe  event  of  a  regional  crisis  in  which  a  clutch  of  countries  needs \nemergency  financial  support,  $120  billion  is  unlikely  to  be  sufficient. \nDuring the 1997/98 crisis, Asian countries required between $40 billion \nand  $60  billion  in  liquidity  support;  yet,  as  shown  in  Table  2.14,  the \nlargest  ASEAN  economies  (Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand) can individually access less than $12 billion \nfrom CMIM funds.41 ASEAN+3 countries could easily increase the fund \nsize by tapping their international reserves: the CMIM amounts to less \nthan 3% of the near $4.2 trillion in international reserves that ASEAN+3 \ncountries had accumulated by the end of 2009 (Figure 2.15). \n\nWhile  capital  flows  to  ASEAN+3  countries  are  growing  rapidly \nagain, after an initial decline when the global financial crisis struck in \n2008/09, they remain highly volatile (Somchai and Sussangkarn 2009; \nPlummer 2010). During the crisis, the Republic of Korea and Singapore \nopted  to  request  bilateral  lines  from  the  US  Federal  Reserve  instead \nof  mobilizing  CMI  funds,  perhaps  because  the  funds  available  were \nnot enough to cover their liquidity needs during the credit squeeze of \nlate 2008 (Soesastro 2008). \n\nTo facilitate an increase in the CMIM fund, member countries may \nhave to move away from self-insurance in the form of foreign reserves, \nand start shifting funds towards this regional support facility. Whether \nthe  CMIM  eventually  develops  into  a  regional  fund  for  monetary \ncooperation  that  can  fully  cater  for  emergency  liquidity  needs  will \ndepend on a number of factors, including how the CMIM\u2019s membership \nand size evolve, as well as how effectively the AMRO performs regional \nsurveillance.\n\nTo conclude, Asian economic authorities have various options to \nstrengthen  macroeconomic  and  financial  cooperation  and  promote \n\n41  Compared with the total amount of IMF quotas, which at the end of February 2010 \n\namounted to some $71 billion for ASEAN+3 countries, CMIM contributions do not seem \nsmall, although this amount was only 25% of total IMF contributions ($333 billion).\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n77\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 2.15.

Regional Public Goods \n\nWhile  economic  cooperation  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  has  focused \non  trade,  investment,  finance,  and  monetary  initiatives,  regional \nauthorities  have  also  initiated  dialogue  and  programs  aimed  at \nfacilitating  the  collective  provision  of  regional  public  goods  (RPGs) \n\n\fin  areas  such  as  the  environment,  health,  communicable  diseases, \nsecurity,  and  education.  Cooperation  in  delivering  RPGs  is  gaining \nissues  such  as  environmental  protection \nmomentum  because \nand  controlling  pandemics  are  assuming  strategic  importance  for \ngovernments,  which  increasingly  realize  that  such  public  goods  can \nbe provided more efficiently at a regional level rather than wholly at a \nnational or global level.42\n\nThe potential benefits of regional cooperation for the provision of \npublic goods are huge. A survey of the region\u2019s opinion leaders in 2008 \nfor the EAR study found that while cooperation in this area was lagging, \nit  was  expected  to  bring  the  largest  benefits.  The  survey  results  also \nsuggested that in order to provide and manage RPGs, Asian countries \nshould begin a regional dialogue and create specific institutions that \nhelp to sustain these types of initiatives (Capannelli 2010).43 The survey \nof  the  region\u2019s  opinion  leaders  conducted  for  this  study  produced \nsimilar results (see Appendix 1).\n\nRegional  public  goods  can  be  split  into  two  groups:  those  that \ninvolve pan-regional externalities and are therefore best addressed at \na region-wide level; and those with a more limited geographical scope, \nwhich  are  nonetheless  important  and  require  proper  coordination \namong interested parties to avoid unnecessary and costly duplication. \nIn the first case, countries can reap economies of scale and internalize \npositive spillovers as more of them cooperate; in the second, countries \ncan  gain  from  specialization  in  functional  areas  through  proper \ncoordination.  To  be  sure,  it  is  not  always  easy  to  identify  the  exact \ngeographical  scope  of  RPGs  and  thus  which  group  should  provide \nthem  (Tanzi  2005).  In  some  cases,  they  may  be  best  provided  by  a \nsubset of countries within a region; in others, global cooperation may \nbe more effective. Box 2.6 outlines selected initiatives that help provide \nRPGs in Asia.\n\n42  A clear rationale for cooperating to provide RPGs emerges when the effectiveness of \n\npolicy initiatives and programs increases as ties with neighboring countries or members of \nregional groupings are strengthened (Sandler 2005). Public goods have two fundamental \ncharacteristics: it is not possible to exclude anyone from using them (non-excludability), \nand consumption of the good by one individual does not diminish the amount available for \nothers (non-rivalry). In general they are unlikely to be supplied by market mechanisms, since \npotential suppliers are deterred by the knowledge that they will not be able to reap the full \nbenefit of their efforts. Intervention is therefore needed to ensure adequate provision.\n43  More than 40% of respondents to the 2008 perception survey (600 opinion leaders from \nSouth, Northeast, and Southeast Asia) found that regional cooperation among Asian \ncountries in the provision of RPGs was still very weak, especially in South and Northeast \nAsia. More than 80% of respondents thought that the advantages of strengthening \nintergovernmental initiatives to provide RPGs were very high, while 73% suggested that \nAsian countries needed to create regional institutions for providing RPGs.\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n79\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBox 2.6. Selected Initiatives to Provide Regional Public Goods in Asia\n\nIn recent years, countries in Asia and the Pacific \n\nhave  launched  several  initiatives  to  provide \nregional public goods (RPGs), and some have \n\nalready proven quite successful. \n\nFor  example,  the  Coral  Triangle  Initiative, \nwhich  seeks  to  protect  coastal  and  maritime \nresources,  and  the  Clean  Air  Initiative  for  Asian \nCities  have  both  established  secretariats  to  help \ndeliver  their  activities.  The  Heart  of  Borneo \nInitiative has recently launched various programs \nto  protect  the  region\u2019s  biodiversity  by  engaging \nlocal  communities  and  nongovernment \nwith \norganizations.  Another  successful  example \nis \nthe  Central  Asian  Countries  Initiative  for  Land \nManagement,  which  focuses  on  the  restoration, \nland \nmaintenance,  and  enhancement  of \nresources in order to improve the economic and \nsocial  conditions  of  the  local  population  in  an  \neco-friendly manner.\n\nCoral Triangle Initiative \n\n\u2022  Members:  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Papua  New \nGuinea,  Philippines,  Solomon  Islands,  and \nTimor-Leste.\n\n\u2022  Starting date: 2007.\n\u2022  Objective:  Protecting  and  addressing  threats \nto  critical  coastal  and  marine  resources, \nespecially coral. \n\n\u2022  Implementation:  Activities  are  coordinated \nregional  action  plan,  and \nthrough  national  plans.  A \n\nthrough  a \nimplemented \nsecretariat is being established in Indonesia.\n\u2022  Support:  National  governments  and  regional \n\ndevelopment institutions.\n\nClean Air Initiative for Asian Cities \n\n\u2022  Members:  Afghanistan,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan, \nCambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic \nof Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Philippines, \nSingapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\n\n\u2022  Starting date: 2001.\n\u2022  Objective:  Improving  management  of  air \nquality  in  Asian  cities.  In  particular,  sharing \nknowledge  and  experience  on  air-quality \nmanagement;  enhancing  the  capacity  of \nAsian cities to manage air quality; improving \nregional  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks \n\nExamples  of  regional  cooperation  initiatives  to  internalize  pan-\n\nAsian spillovers include the following.\n\n\u2022  Environment.  Asia\u2019s  rapid  economic  growth  has  placed  a \ngreat  strain  on  the  environment  in  urban  and  industrial  areas \nand  beyond,  not  to  mention  contributing  to  global  issues \nsuch  as  deforestation,  climate  change,  and  rising  sea  levels. \nMajor  areas  of  concern  being  addressed  through  initiatives \nfor regional cooperation include air and water pollution, land \ndegradation,  biodiversity  loss,  coastal  management,  aquatic \nresource depletion, and competition over river resources. \n\n80\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\nand  their  implementation;  promoting  the \nintegrated  air-quality \nimplementation  of \nmanagement  strategies  and  regulations; \nand  encouraging  innovation  through  pilot \nprojects.\n\n\u2022  Implementation:  Creation  of \n\nthe  Clean \nAir  Initiative  for  Asian  Cities  Center \nin \nthe  Philippines  as  a  nonstock,  nonprofit \ncorporation  which  coordinates  with  local \nnetworks. \n\n\u2022  Support: Asian Development Bank and other \n\ndevelopment institutions.\n\nHeart of Borneo Initiative\n\n\u2022  Members:  Brunei  Darussalam,  Indonesia, \n\nand Malaysia. \n\u2022  Starting date: 2006.\n\u2022  Objective:  Ensuring  effective  management, \ndevelopment,  and  conservation  of  natural \nresources  and  biodiversity  in  the  Heart  of \nBorneo,  the  central  highland  of  the  island \nwhich  covers  approximately  20,000  km2  of \nequatorial rainforests and supports some 6% \nof the world\u2019s total biodiversity. \n\n\u2022  Implementation:  Member  countries  follow \nstrategic and operational plans supporting a \nroadmap  under  the  five-year  action  plan  of \nthe  Brunei  Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-\nPhilippines East ASEAN Growth Area.\n\n\u2022  Support: National governments and regional \ndevelopment and environmental institutions.\n\nCentral Asian Countries Initiative  \nfor Land Management \n\n\u2022  Members:  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\n\u2022  Starting date: 2001.\n\u2022  Objective:  Restoration,  maintenance,  and \nenhancement of the productive functions of \nthe land, leading to improved economic and \nsocial well-being of the people who depend \non  these  resources  while  preserving  the \necological functions of the land. \n\n\u2022  Implementation:  Multi-country  framework \nstructured  on  a  10-year  program  of \nactivities in each country based on national \nprogramming frameworks and activities.\n\u2022  Support: International donor community. \n\n\u2022  Disaster  risk  management.  Regional  calamities  such  as  the \n2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Pakistan earthquake \nhighlighted  the  cross-border  impact  of  natural  disasters  and \nthe  need  for  regional  cooperation  to  establish  early  warning \nsystems and proper mechanisms for coordinating the response \nacross the region and from outside donors.\n\n\u2022  Prevention  and  management  of  communicable  diseases. \nThe  emergence  and  rapid  spread  of  communicable  diseases \nsuch as HIV/AIDS, severe  acute respiratory  syndrome (SARS), \nand  avian  influenza  are  a  negative  consequence  of  greater \n\n81\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nintegration and increased cross-border mobility. Preventing and \nmanaging health problems of this nature require broad regional \nframeworks and coordination among all regional members.\n\u2022  Energy.  Regional  cooperation  is  important  to  help  overcome \nAsia\u2019s  excessive  reliance  on  fossil-based  energy,  diversify  to \nother energy sources such as crude oil, gas, and hydropower, \nand  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  uneven  distribution  of  such \nresources  across  countries.  Regional  cooperation  to  provide \nRPGs  is  also  important  for  other  reasons,  notably  ensuring \nenergy  security,  identifying  collective  solutions  to  energy \nconstraints, and promoting energy trade. Eventually, integrating \nAsia\u2019s  energy  markets  could  mobilize  commercial  energy  in \na  reliable,  financially  sustainable,  and  environmentally  sound \nmanner.\n\nfor \n\n\u2022  Human  and  drug  trafficking  reduction.  Increased  regional \nintegration  provides  an  opening \nthe  expansion  of \ntransnational  crime.  Recent  studies  have  found  that  human \nand drug trafficking increase when there are differential growth \nrates across regional economies, as well as when connectivity \nimproves. Progress in addressing these issues requires region-\nwide  policy  dialogue  and  cooperation  among  the  largest \npossible number of national authorities.\n\nAnother  important  area  for  regional  cooperation  is  combating \nclimate  change  and  promoting  low-carbon  green  growth.  Individual \ncountries  and  development  agencies  such  as  ESCAP  and  ADB  have \nalready  launched  initiatives  in  this  area.  The  first  regional  policy \ndialogue on green growth was held in 2005 in the Republic of Korea, \nwhere  several  countries  launched  the  Seoul  Initiative  on  Green \nGrowth.  The  Manila  Declaration  on  Green  Industry  in  Asia,  which \nwas signed in 2009, reaffirmed countries\u2019 commitments to global and \nregional  initiatives  supporting  green  growth  and  their  determination \nto  adopt  \u201cpolicies,  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks,  where \nappropriate,  which  are  conducive  to  shifting  towards  resource-\nefficient and low-carbon industries, consistent with the sustainability \nbusiness principle.\u201d44\n\nRegional  cooperation  to  support  green  growth  is  important \nbecause  it  can  help  coordinate  national  strategies  and  policies \n\n44  Manila Declaration on Green Industry in Asia, Manila, Philippines, 9 September 2009. \n\nwww.greengrowth.org/download/2009/manila%20declaration%20clean%20copy090909.pdf \n\n82\n\n\fby  providing  consistent  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks.45 \nComprehensive  initiatives  can  help  achieve  coordinated  objectives \nsuch  as  ensuring  the  efficiency  of  energy  sources,  creating  new \nbusiness and job opportunities in green industries, and promoting the \nadoption  of  environmentally  sustainable  infrastructure  and  transport \nsystems (ADB/ADBI 2009). \n\nRPGs  pose  two  major  institutional  design  challenges.  The  first \nis  whether  public  goods  should  be  provided  by  new  institutions \nor  existing  ones.  In  general,  it  may  be  cheaper  and  easier  to  use \nexisting  institutions  in  which  partners  are  used  to  working  together. \nHowever, new institutions may be needed when the functional area \nof cooperation is new or the regional coverage of an issue does not \nfit well with existing arrangements. A second challenge relates to the \nestablishment  of  subsidiary  standards  in  order  to  tailor  institutional \nresponses  as  closely  as  possible  to  the  area  where  regional  public \ngoods generate spillovers.46 \n\n2.9. Filling the Gaps\n\nWhile Asia has made impressive progress in economic development \nand  regional  integration,  a  striking  feature  that  emerges  from  the \nanalysis  in  this  chapter  is  that  regionalism  has  advanced  unevenly: \nit is focused almost exclusively on production integration in East Asia, \nwhile other sectors and subregions are generally much less integrated. \nThe  networks  of  production  facilities  established  in  many  East \nAsian  countries  in  industries  such  as  electronics,  automobiles,  and \nmachinery\u2014\u201cFactory  Asia\u201d\u2014have  tied  economies  together  through \ntrade and FDI. But regional integration in other functional areas such \nas  final  goods,  services,  labor,  and  financial  markets  has  lagged \nbehind.  Financial  integration  is  increasing,  but  is  still  quite  low. \nRegional integration in South and Central Asia and the Pacific has also \nproceeded much more slowly than in East Asia. \n\nTable 2.15 captures the uneven progress of regionalism in Asia and \nthe Pacific: while integration is more advanced in East Asia, ties within \n\n45  While Japan and the Republic of Korea have taken an early lead in supporting \n\nenvironment-friendly economic growth strategies, countries such as Cambodia, Fiji \nIslands, the Philippines, and Viet Nam have also now adopted national policies promoting \nlow-carbon green growth. Such policies typically seek to mitigate greenhouse gas \nemissions and cope with the impacts of climate change. \n\n46  Any disruption in applying this principle may lead to suboptimal cooperation results, mainly \n\nbecause of a mismatch between benefits and contributions (Kanbur 2001).\n\nProgress of Regionalism\n\n83\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nTable 2.15.

The assessments in the last two columns are based on quantitative and anecdotal evidence. \n\nSource: ADB staff estimates.\n\nand  among  other  subregions  remain  weak\u2014and  even  in  East  Asia \neconomic integration has advanced unevenly across functional areas. \nTo help correct these two imbalances\u2014the twin challenges of Asian \nregionalism\u2014regional  authorities  need  to  design  a  proper  roadmap \nfor integration, with the aim of achieving an economic community in \nthe long run.\n\nWhile national policies to improve economic infrastructure, attract \nFDI, and liberalize trade unilaterally helped foster the development of \n\u201cFactory Asia\u201d, most analysts agree that until the 1997/98 crisis market \nforces were the main driver of economic regionalism in Asia. \n\nIn  contrast  to  Europe,  where  regionalism  has  been  as  much \npolitical  as  economic,  integration  in  Asia  has  been  mostly  driven  by \nforeign trade and direct investment. The efficiency advantages of regional \nsupply chains and production networks have fostered trade integration, \nleading to integration in other areas. FDI accompanies trade, insofar as \ntrade and investment are complements. In this model, financial flows \nfollow  trade  flows\u2014as  portfolio  investment  is  used  to  hedge  trade-\nrelated risks\u2014and as vertical intra-industry trade rises, so do business \ncycle  co-movements  and  macroeconomic  interdependence  (Frankel \nand Rose 1998; di Giovanni and Levchenko 2009). \n\nThe analysis in this chapter provides evidence of this trend in Asia, \nand suggests focusing on trade links as the measure of interdependence \n\n84\n\n\fProgress of Regionalism\n\nfrom  which  other  links  will  follow.  And  since  East  Asia  is  the  most \nintegrated  subregion  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  it  is  also  where  the \npotential gains from closer cooperation may be greatest.\n\nSince  the  1997/98  crisis,  intergovernmental  cooperation  has \nplayed  a  bigger  role  in  strengthening  regional  economic  integration, \nespecially  in  monetary  and  financial  areas.  As  a  result,  financial \nintegration,  although  still  relatively  low,  has  increased\u2014especially  in \nEast  Asia\u2014over  the  past  decade.  In  South  Asia,  however,  trade  and \nfinancial  ties  remain  weak,  and  only  recently  have  policy  initiatives \nstarted to improve matters. \n\nTrade links and regional connectivity (in transport and energy) are \nalso low between East and South Asia, presenting huge opportunities \nfor  interregional  integration.  Central  Asia  is  poorly  integrated  (apart \nfrom moderately high labor mobility), although recent initiatives and \nprograms  have  started  to  help  it  enhance  connectivity  with  South \nand East Asia as well as with Europe and the Middle East. The Pacific \nIslands have insurmountable geographical barriers to closer economic \nintegration, which translate into low indicators of regional economic \nintegration. The right mix of market forces and policy cooperation in \nAsia and the Pacific may help fill in the gaps and foster a more balanced \nregional economic integration.\n\n85\n\n\fChapter 2:  Appendix\n\nTable A2.1.

In a demand-driven model of institution \nbuilding,  institutions  develop  as  a  means  of  problem-\nsolving.  The  issues  that  they  attempt  to  tackle  may  relate  to  cross-\nborder spillovers (externalities) associated with economic integration, \nstrategic competition, foreign policy aims, or domestic politics. In the \narea of economic policy, the focus of this report, regional institutions \nmay  help  to  meet  three  types  of  demand  that  arise  from  regional \neconomic integration.\n\nFirst,  they  can  help  consolidate  gains  from  integration,  whether \nas the result of regional initiatives or steps at the national and global \nlevels. For example, regional agreements can prevent backsliding on \ntrade  and  investment  liberalization,  including  unilateral  actions  by \nnational governments.\n\nSecond,  regional  institutions  can  also  help  deepen  regional \nintegration. In addition to the lifting of barriers to exchange at the border \n(such  as  tariffs  and  non-tariff  barriers),  governments  may  commit \nto  remove  barriers  that  lie  behind  the  border  in  an  array  of  politically \nsensitive  (and  often  jealously  guarded)  domestic  policies.  Regional \ninstitutions  can  make  such  commitments  credible  by  monitoring  and \nenforcing them.\n\nThird, regional institutions can help widen economic integration. \nThey  may  help  develop  infrastructure  that  lowers  transport  and \ncommunication  costs.  They  may  also  establish  new  policy  regimes \n\n92\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nthat  admit  governments  originally  outside  the  core  of  integrating \neconomies. Whereas deepening tends to be a response to economic \nintegration,  widening  is  often  a  response  to  a  lack  of  it,  aiming  to \nstrengthen ties between previously disconnected regions.\n\nInstitutions  for  regional  integration  (IRIs)  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nshould  aim  to  satisfy  these  three  demands,  together  or  separately. \nAs well as responding to demands from within the region, they may \nseek  to  respond  to\u2014and  influence\u2014changes  in  the  international \nenvironment.  Demands  for  new  institutions  can  arise  from  external \nshocks\u2014a  defensive  regionalism  that  deploys  institutions  to  buffer \neconomies  against  future  shocks.  The  Chiang  Mai  Initiative  (CMI), \ndescribed  in  Chapters  2  and  4,  was  an  institutional  response  to  the \n1997/98  financial  crisis,  which  many  Asian  governments  attributed \nto  defects  in  the  global  financial  system.  Regional  institutions  can \nalso  enable  their  members  to  influence  global  decision-making  and \nnegotiations.  In  the  early  1990s,  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \n(APEC) served as a regional \u201clobby\u201d in the final stages of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round negotiations. \nThe drive for stronger institutions in Asia today is in part motivated by \nthe desire for a more influential regional voice at the global level.\n\nDespite their potential for valuable problem-solving at the regional \nlevel,  creating  and  reforming  regional  institutions  are  inherently \ndifficult.  The  prospect  of  efficiency  gains  or  enhanced  economic \nwelfare  alone  is  rarely  enough  to  secure  agreement  on  a  particular \ninstitutional  design.  Institutions  may  fail  to  achieve  their  original \nmandates  or  the  subsequent  goals  set  by  their  members.  In  other \nwords, the supply of regional institutions may not always respond to \ndemand\u2014and those that are supplied may not effectively serve their \nprincipals, the national governments that create them.\n\nThe  chapter  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  3.1  examines  the \nrole  of  a  region\u2019s  initial  characteristics,  which  often  indicate  the \nenabling  conditions  for\u2014and  obstacles  to\u2014institutional  development. \nTheir effects can be partially overcome (or exploited) through careful \ninstitutional  design.  Section  3.2  considers  three  drivers  of  institution \nbuilding over time: the possible linkage between economic and security \nissues,  feedback  mechanisms  from  economic  integration  that  can \nreinforce regional institutions, and the competition and complementarity \nof  global,  regional,  and  subregional  institutions.  Section  3.3  outlines \nelements  of  institutional  design  that  can  enhance  cooperation  given \ndiverse  national  preferences  and  capabilities.  Section  3.4  examines \nhow to measure institutions\u2019 effectiveness. Section 3.5 concludes.\n\n93\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n3.1. Regional Characteristics\n\nThree  initial  characteristics  of  a  region  generally  influence  regional \ninstitution building: the diversity of national preferences over economic \ncooperation and regional institutions, asymmetries in economic and \nmilitary power, and the influence exerted by actors outside the region.\n\nPreferences over Regional Cooperation  \nand Institutions\nWhen national governments come to favor similar policies, cooperative \nbargains  are  more  likely  to  be  struck  and  consistently  implemented \nwithin  regional  institutions  (Kelley  2009).  Closer  regional  economic \nintegration may strengthen demands from corporations and governments \nfor \nto  cross-border  spillovers  and  policy \nvolatility. These demands should, in turn, produce national preference \nconvergence that facilitates regional cooperation (see Chapter 1).\n\ninstitutional  responses \n\nOther  characteristics  may  also  influence  the  range  of  national \npolicy  preferences  in  a  region.  Income  disparities\u2014the  gap  in  per \ncapita  gross  domestic  product  between  the  richest  and  poorest \ncountries\u2014may produce policy disagreements grounded in divergent \neconomic interests and gaps in capacities to implement international \ncommitments. States in a wholly democratic region may be more willing \nto  join  regional  institutions;  greater  political  and  policy  transparency \nalso tends to promote regional cooperation. Democracy\u2019s impact on \nthe implementation of international commitments is more ambiguous \n(Simmons  2001;  Kelley  2009).  If  dominant  political  coalitions  are \ninternationalist, regional collaboration is also more likely.47 Integrating \nAsia\u2019s  increasing  economic  interdependence  and  its  leadership  by \nelites committed to establishing links to the world economy have both \nsupported regional institution building. However, even if governments \nagree that greater regional cooperation is needed, they may not agree \non how regional institutions should be designed.\n\nAsymmetries in Economic and Military Power\nHeightened demand for regional collaboration is not enough to create \nthe requisite institutions. Establishing and maintaining institutions are \ncostly; disagreements over how to distribute those costs may impede \n\n47  Solingen (2009) compares the Middle East and Asia on this dimension.\n\n94\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nregional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  distribution  of  economic \ninfluence and military power within a region may affect governments\u2019 \nwillingness  to  establish  regional  institutions.  However,  researchers \ndisagree on whether a region with a dominant power or one with a \nmore balanced distribution of power is more likely to construct robust \ninstitutions.48\n\nA  dominant  regional  power  may  be  willing  to  provide  a \ndisproportionate share of regional public goods as well as institutional \nresources  to  ease  distributional  conflicts.  A  leading  economy  can \nalso  serve  as  a  focal  point  around  which  others  coordinate  national \npolicies. In Europe, for example, Germany served as the anchor for the \nEuropean Monetary System before the euro\u2019s launch. Japan provided \nfinancial  leadership  in  Asia  following  the  1997/98  crisis  through  the \nNew Miyazawa Initiative.49 This leadership was supported by monetary \npolicy credibility (Germany) and large international reserves (Japan).\n\nHowever,  larger  countries  tend  to  be  less  willing  to  delegate \nauthority  to  regional  institutions,  and  regional  leadership  that  is \nperceived  as  illegitimate  or  overbearing  can  produce  a  backlash \nthat  undermines  cooperation.50  A  further  complicating  factor  is  the \ndynamic of power relations: rapid and uneven economic growth may \nproduce shifts in economic and military power that make institutional \nbargains more difficult to construct. Ultimately, whether great-power \nrivalry or reconciliation dominates a region may be more significant \nthan the number of such powers. Political accommodation between \nFrance  and  Germany  was  crucial  to  the  development  of  European \ninstitutions; a similar reconciliation between Brazil and Argentina laid \nthe foundations for the Mercado Com\u00fan del Sur (Mercosur).\n\nInfluence of External Actors\nOutside intervention and bargaining power can have both positive and \nnegative effects on regional collaboration and institutional outcomes. \nBy  creating  an  external  threat  to  regional  security  (the  Soviet  Union \nduring  the  Cold  War)  or  economic  shocks  (the  United  States  during \nthe  post-Bretton  Woods  era),  governments  outside  a  region  may \nencourage  \u201cdefensive  regionalism\u201d\u2014closer  regional  collaboration  to \n\n48  Compare Mattli (1999), Acharya and Johnston (2007b), and Dominguez (2007).\n49  The formal title of the New Miyazawa Initiative was \u201cA New Initiative to Overcome the \n\nAsian Currency Crisis.\u201d \n\n50  Smith (2000) documents powerful states\u2019 influence on the design of dispute settlement \n\nmechanisms. Khadiagala (2009) points to the resentment of Nigerian leadership within the \nEconomic Community of West African States.\n\n95\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nmitigate negative externalities from outside the region. In regions with \nimportant ties to external powers, those outside parties will be deeply \ninterested  in  the  choices  made  in  building  regional  institutions  and \npossess substantial leverage to influence those choices.\n\n3.2. Institutional Dynamics\n\nA region\u2019s underlying characteristics are not the sole determinants of \nthe  shape  and  effectiveness  of  regional  institutions.  Four  additional \nfactors  also  shape  the  dynamics  of  regional  institution  building. \nFirst, the  interaction between security conditions and economic ties \ninfluences the development of regional institutions. Second, economic \nintegration  itself  can  create  positive  (or  negative)  feedback  effects \non  institutionalization.  Third,  global  and  subregional  institutional \nalternatives may compete with, or complement, regional institutions. \nFourth,  contingencies  may  interrupt  or  accelerate  these  processes: \npolitical entrepreneurs may advance regional aims; external economic \nshocks and crises may disrupt or deepen regional collaboration.\n\nEconomics and Security\nNo  region  directly  manages  core  economic  and  security  issues  in  a \nsingle  regional  institution.  Nevertheless,  the  interrelated  dynamics \nof  economic  integration  and  security  provision  have  influenced  the \ndevelopment of regional institutions. Military conflict within a region \nmay  disrupt  regional  institutions  and  slow  the  growth  of  cross-\nborder economic exchange. An external military threat, such as that \nexperienced by Western Europe during the Cold War, often reinforces \ndrives for institutional means to confront those threats.\n\nIn other circumstances, the careful linkage of peacebuilding\u2014the \ngradual winding down of regional rivalries\u2014and economic integration \nhas strengthened both economic and security cooperation. Regional \ninstitutions can be built on an association between economic opening \nand  a  lowering  of  military  tensions.  They  can  in  turn  reinforce  this \nlinkage  through  the  risk  of  economic  loss  from  political  or  military \nconflict.  As  regional  collaboration  reinforces  economic  ties,  the \ncosts  imposed  by  militarized  disputes  and  conflict  increase.  Box  3.1 \ndescribes how political economists model this interaction.\n\n96\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nBox 3.1. Modeling the Complementarity of Economic and Security Relations\n\nHamada  and  Lee\u2019s  (2009)  modeling  of \n\neconomic  and  security  relations  in  Asia \nproceeds  as  follows.  They  assume  that \nthe  structure  of  economic  interests  resembles  a \nprisoners\u2019  dilemma  game,  whereby  two  countries \nenjoy  higher  returns  by  cooperating  but  have  an \nincentive to backslide in the absence of retaliation. \nThe danger is that both countries backslide and suffer \nlower returns as a result. In the presence of relatively \nlow  discount  rates,  improvements  in  information, \nand  an  environment  of  trust,  repeated  interaction \nmay enable cooperation to evolve. Institutionalizing \nthe  governments\u2019 \nthey \ninteract  repeatedly  in  an  improved  information \nenvironment\u2014thus benefits both countries.\n\nrelationship\u2014so \n\nthat \n\nThe structure of security interests, in contrast, \nresembles  a  hawk\u2013dove  game.  The  structure  of \npayoffs  is  similar,  except  that  when  both  players \n\nadopt  the  \u201chawkish\u201d  strategy  they  both  suffer \nvery serious losses. This game has one \u201csubgame \nperfect  equilibrium\u201d\u2014a  situation  where  neither \ncountry  can  gain  from  changing  its  strategy  so \nlong  as  the  other\u2019s  is  unchanged\u2014where  both \ncountries  adopt  the  dovish  strategy,  and  another \nthat provides a payoff that is slightly better than if \nboth adopt a hawkish strategy.\n\nthe \n\ntwo  governments  play \n\nGiven  these  structures,  linking  the  games\u2014\nhaving \nthem \nsimultaneously\u2014can  improve  the  likelihood  of \ncooperation.  Cooperating  in  the  economic  game \nwill  increase  the  cost  of  security  conflict  insofar \nas  this  causes  economic  disruptions.  Similarly, \nsecurity cooperation will create a sense of trust that \nleads  to  additional  trade  and  foreign  investment, \nenhancing  the  payoff  to  economic  cooperation \nand thus encouraging it.\n\nSpillovers and Feedback Effects\nPrescriptions for the sequencing of regional economic arrangements \nand institutions often involve a crude linear determinism: an inevitable \nand formulaic progression from free trade agreement (FTA) to customs \nunion to common market and common currency. The theoretical and \nempirical  basis  for  these  prescriptions  is  suspect.  More  compelling \nis  an  analysis  of  the  spillovers  and  feedback  loops  produced  by \neconomic  integration  and  its  accompanying  institutions\u2014processes \nthat  may  (or  may  not)  widen  the  scope  of  regional  institutions  and \ncommon policies.\n\nBased  on  the  experience  of  Europe  and  other  regions,  Baldwin \n(1993,  2009)  identifies  several  feedback  mechanisms  of  varying \nstrength; their sequencing may produce more or less institutionalization \ninterest-based \nas  trade  and \nconjectures: trade liberalization increases the political weight of export \ninterests, which demand further liberalization. These trade-dependent \n\ninvestment  expand.  Most \n\ninvolve \n\n97\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\neconomic interests may lobby for membership in an expanding FTA or \ncustoms union because of the threat of trade discrimination, a \u201cdomino \neffect\u201d that creates successive waves of applicants. Alternatively, they \ncould  lobby  for  offsetting  regional  or  bilateral  arrangements  with  at \nleast  some  of  the  FTA  members.  Feedback  mechanisms  may  also \nlink  trade  and  exchange-rate  cooperation.  Governments  (and  trade-\ndependent economic interests) may become more attracted to stable \nexchange  rates  as  economies  become  more  open  to  international \ntrade  and  capital  controls  are  removed  (Frieden  1991;  Eichengreen \n1996; Baldwin 2009).\n\nBaldwin  (2009)  also  highlights  the  importance  of  institutional \nfeedback\u2014the  ability  of  regional  institutions  to  amplify  and  channel \ndemands for integration into further institutional elaboration\u2014in cases \nwhere institutions have both a mandate from national governments to \nfurther economic integration and the delegated authority to carry out \nthat mandate. Effective institutions may also create demands for further \ninstitutional development; institutional failures produce resistance to it.\nThese  feedback  mechanisms  will  be  weakened  if  regions  find \nsubstitutes  for  institutional  strengthening  that  satisfy  the  demands \nof  trade-dependent  constituencies  in  other  ways.  Also,  regional \ncooperation,  whether  in  trade  or  monetary  and  financial  areas,  has \nsometimes  proceeded  on  the  basis  of  political  and  foreign  policy \ncalculations  rather  than  felt  demand.  Even  in  the  absence  of  strong \neconomic  feedback  effects,  those  steps  may  deepen  economic \ncooperation  through  political  spillovers,  the  creation  of  habits  of \ncooperation, and heightened trust.\n\nGlobal, Regional, and Subregional Institutions\nSince the 1990s (if not the 1930s), the prospect that regional institutions \nmight  undermine  global  rules  and  institutions  has  preoccupied \nproponents  of  trade  liberalization  (for  contrasting  views  see  Barton \net al. 2006; Bhagwati 2008; Lawrence 1996). Less attention has been \npaid  to  the  competition  that  successful  global  institutions  pose  to \nthe development of regional governance. To the extent that regional \ninstitutions  exist  to  solve  problems  and  global  ones  achieve  some \nof  those  ends  more  effectively,  the  impetus  for  regional  institution \nbuilding  may  be  undercut.  In  certain  areas,  such  as  trade,  explicit \nrules  govern  the  relationship  between  global  regimes  and  regional \ninstitutions  (GATT  Article  XXIV,  for  example);  such  explicit  rules  are \nabsent in the sphere of monetary and financial cooperation.\n\n98\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nSubregional  institutions  may  also  compete  with  one  another,  as \nwell  as  with  regional  institutions.  Such  competition  appears  to  be \nmost  damaging  when  subregional  organizations  have  overlapping \nmemberships  and  similar  policy  mandates.  Where  a  clear  division \nof  labor  exists  among  subregional  institutions,  or  between  them \nand  region-wide  organizations,  relations  are  more  likely  to  be \ncomplementary than competitive.\n\nContingencies\nContingencies\u2014which  are  inherently  difficult  to  predict\u2014often  have \na decisive influence on the development of regional institutions. They \nmay include unexpected domestic events, such as Indonesia\u2019s regime \nchange  in  1965,  which  was  an  essential  precursor  to  the  formation \nof  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN).  Political \nentrepreneurs\u2014national  leaders  who  promote  bold  new  policy \ninitiatives\u2014are particularly important. They may do so because they are \nstaunch believers in regional cooperation, or because they calculate \nthat  regional  institution  building  may  bolster  their  domestic  political \nposition\u2014or indeed their legacy.51 Europe\u2019s institutional development \nhas benefited periodically from such individuals, notably the original \ncore  of  politicians  who  founded  the  European  project  and  Jacques \nDelors, the integrationist president of the European Commission in the \n1980s. In Asia, Prime Minister Mohamad Mahathir of Malaysia promoted \nan  East  Asian  Economic  Group  in  the  early  1990s,  an  idea  that  was \nonly realized with the creation of ASEAN+3 later in the decade. When \nthey were prime ministers of their respective countries, Japan\u2019s Yukio \nHatoyama and Australia\u2019s Kevin Rudd sought to play a similar role in \nthe debate on Asia\u2019s institutional architecture.\n\nPolitical  entrepreneurs  may  seize  on  another  contingency: \nexogenous shocks, particularly economic crises. Henning (2009a) finds \nthat regional institution building is closely connected to economic and \nfinancial  crises.  Drawing  on  cases  such  as  the  Latin  American  debt \ncrisis of the 1980s, the European currency crisis of the 1990s, and the \n1997/98 financial crisis in Asia, Henning finds that a crisis with severe \nregional  effects  creates  doubts  about  global  institutions  and  revives \ninterest  in  regional  solutions  to  regional  economic  problems.  Crises \nalso  often  force  a  reordering  of  national  and  international  priorities, \ncreating  a  more  conducive  environment  for  political  entrepreneurs. \n\n51  On the role of the political entrepreneur in the creation of international institutions, see \n\nKeohane (2001).\n\n99\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nGovernments  may  have  a  window  of  opportunity  in  which  they  can \novercome  skepticism  at  home  and  achieve  compromises  with  their \nregional partners, producing a regional public good that is viewed as a \npressing need in difficult times. Box 3.2 looks in greater depth at how \ncrises may shape regional integration.\n\nFor all the progress of national reforms and regional cooperation \nsince the 1997/98 crisis, the recent crisis has reminded the region of \nits vulnerabilities and given fresh impetus to regional cooperation, not \nleast in financial areas.\n\nBox 3.2. Role of Crises in Shaping Regional Integration\n\nEconomic  and  financial  crises  can  play  a \n\ncrucial  role  in  helping\u2014or  hindering\u2014the \ndevelopment  of  regionalism.  Historically, \nobservers  point  to  the  1992  currency  crisis  in \nEurope  and  the  1997/98  financial  crisis  in  East \nAsia  as  catalysts  for  closer  regional  cooperation. \nAcademic  theory  suggests  that  crises  encourage \nreform (in this context, toward regional integration) \nby causing practitioners to modify their world view \n(Harberger 1993), making clear that the status quo \nis problematic (Drazen and Grilli 1993; Laban and \nSturzenegger 1994), and undermining the position \nof vested interests that favor the status quo (Olson \n1982).\n\nWhether  a  particular  crisis  stimulates  or \ndisrupts regional cooperation depends on a host of \nfactors,  including  domestic  politics,  intraregional \nrivalries, \nregional  economic \ninterdependence,  the  effectiveness  of  existing \nregional  institutions,  the  actions  of  multilateral \ninstitutions,  and  the  role  of  players  from  outside \nthe region.\n\nthe  degree  of \n\nIf  authorities \n\nthat \ncoordinated  action  is  urgently  required,  they  may \ndevelop  a  common  response  which  continues \n\nin  a  region  recognize \n\nafter  the  immediate  crisis  has  been  resolved. \nAlternatively, if an existing regional institution proves \nincapable of tackling a crisis, it may be bypassed or \nwither away once the crisis has passed.\n\nThe 1997/98 crisis underscored that Asia could \nnot rely on outside help in a crisis. While multilateral \ninstitutions  (notably  the  International  Monetary \nFund)  delayed  disbursing  funds  to  provide  short-\nterm liquidity and mitigate the impact of the crisis, \ncountries outside Asia opposed a proposed regional \nfinancial  facility,  prompting  a  search  for  regional \narrangements  to  address  these  deficiencies.  The \ncrisis  heightened  Asians\u2019  dissatisfaction  with  the \ninternational  financial  architecture  in  general  and \ntheir underrepresentation at multilateral institutions \nin  particular.  The  global  financial  system  seemed \nto  offer  inadequate  protection  against  the  vagaries \nof  international  capital  flows,  while  Asians  were \nfrustrated  by  their  lack  of  say  over  multilateral \ninstitutions\u2019 policies and decisions, notably over the \navailability of finance in a crisis. This bolstered efforts \nto enhance regional cooperation that would amplify \nAsia\u2019s voice in international forums (Henning 2005; \nBeeson  2002).  The  regionalism  that  emerged  after \nthe  crisis  is  \u201caimed  at  restoring  to  Asia  a  greater \n\n100\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nWhen  the  subprime  crisis  in  the  United  States  (US)  became  a \nglobal  financial  meltdown  in  September  2008,  Asia  avoided  a  direct \nhit.  Despite  its  increasing  financial  globalization,  it  held  few  \u201ctoxic\u201d \nassets. But Asia\u2019s asset markets were caught in the global maelstrom \nand  the  real  economy  felt  the  brunt  of  the  crisis.  Growth  slumped, \nwith  the  region\u2019s  dependence  on  exports  to  developed  markets \nproving a source of vulnerability (Goldstein and Xie 2009; ADB 2009a). \nBut  most  emerging  economies  bounced  back  quickly,  while  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, and others continued to grow.  \n\ndegree of political power and autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis the \nrest of the world\u201d (Bowles 2002).\n\nthrough \n\nBefore  the  crisis,  regional  cooperation  was \nprimarily  motivated  by  Asian  economies\u2019  growing \ninterdependence \nregional  production \nnetworks,  foreign  direct  investment,  and  ethnic \ndiasporas. This market-led integration was in keeping \nwith  the  thinking  of  Balassa  (1961)  and  the  liberal \nschool, whereby increasing cross-border economic \nties spurs regional cooperation. It was supported by \nliberalization, \nunilateral,  nondiscriminatory  trade \nbut  did  little  to  bolster  monetary  and  financial \nstability.  The  crisis  highlighted  the  region\u2019s  shared \nvulnerability to contagion and the indiscriminate exit \nof foreign capital, as investors reacted to this diverse \nregion as if it were a single entity. This increased the \nneed for regional mechanisms to promote monetary \nand financial stability.\n\nthe \n\nThe  crisis  and \n\nits  aftermath  also  gave \nsubstance to the notion of an \u201cEast Asian region\u201d \nthrough \nthe  ASEAN+3 \nformalization  of \nprocess,  a  development  which  would  have \nbeen  difficult  to  imagine  beforehand.  This  is \nconsistent  with  constructivist  theories,  which \nexplain the emergence of regionalism through the \n\nexpression  of  shared  ideas,  culture,  and  identity. \nThe  actions  of  multilateral  institutions  and  other \nexternal players combined with countries\u2019 shared \nexperience  during  the  turmoil  helped  shape  a \ncollective identity.\n\nASEAN+3  spurred  a  host  of  monetary  and \nfinancial  cooperation \ninitiatives\u2014the  Chiang \nMai  Initiative  (CMI),  a  web  of  bilateral  swap \narrangements  to  supply  liquidity  in  a  crisis;  the \nAsian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  and  Asian  Bond \nFunds  to  develop  local-currency  bond  markets; \na  system  for  strengthening  surveillance;  and  the \nEconomic  Review  and  Policy  Dialogue.  A  region-\nwide  arrangement,  the  East  Asia  Summit,  which \nincludes  India,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand  as \nwell  as  ASEAN+3  members,  was  established \nin  2005.  A  web  of  bilateral  and  plurilateral  free \ntrade  agreements\u2014the  Asian  \u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d\u2014\nhas emerged as well. At their meeting in Istanbul \nin  2005,  ASEAN+3  leaders  pledged  to  explore \n\u201cpossible routes\u201d toward multilateralizing the CMI, \nagreeing  in  Kyoto  in  2007  that  a  \u201cself-managed \nreserve pooling arrangement governed by a single \ncontractual  agreement  is  an  appropriate  form  of \nmultilateralization.\u201d\n\n101\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nPeriodic shortages of dollar liquidity were handled by Asian economies \nindividually rather than collectively (though there was frequent contact \namong  relevant  authorities).  The  Republic  of  Korea  and  Singapore \nwere  offered  a  $30  billion  swap  line  by  the  US  Federal  Reserve. \nIndonesia obtained fiscal support through a consortium of the World \nBank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. As in 1997/98, \nthe region struggled to manage volatile capital flows\u2014sharp outflows \nafter the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, followed by \nlarge inflows into the region as recovery took hold in 2009 and local \nasset markets recovered.\n\nThe CMI could do little to mitigate the impact of the recent global \ncrisis.  But  it  did  not  fail  the  region,  as  some  charge;  it  was  arguably \npremature to expect it to provide effective crisis protection (Henning \n2009). In any case, the crisis accelerated the multilateralization of the \nCMI  in  2009  and  the  establishment  of  an  independent  surveillance \nunit alongside it. These mark the first concrete steps to institutionalize \nan essential fallback for East Asian financial stability. By agreeing on \nmember  contributions,  voting  rights,  and  an  operational  structure, \nASEAN+3  has  established  a  framework  for  addressing  institutional \npriorities and other cooperation issues.\n\nBy  exposing  regulatory  gaps  and  denting  confidence  in  global \ninstitutions  that  manage  credit,  market,  and  liquidity  risk,  the  crisis \nalso  prompted  the  region  to  propose  establishing  an  Asian  financial \nstability  dialogue  (ADB  2009b).  Many  argue  that  a  formal  structure \nis  needed  to  coordinate  macroeconomic  policies  and  surveillance. \nThe \u201cPlus Three\u201d\u2014the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea\u2014held \ntheir  first  meeting  to  discuss  regional  and  global  financial  stability \nin  November  2008.  More  broadly,  the  global  discussion  on  how \nto  enhance  financial  stability  and  governance  has  spurred  Asia  to \nreassess  its  role  in  the  global  economy  and  in  reshaping  the  global \nfinancial  architecture.  The  Financial  Stability  Forum  was  expanded \nin March 2009 to include the PRC, India, Indonesia, and the Republic \nof  Korea  along  with  other  G20  members  which  were  not  previously \nrepresented on it (Financial Stability Forum 2009). Similarly, the Basel \nCommittee  on  Banking  Supervision  was  expanded  in  June  2009  to \ninclude Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and other emerging \neconomies. But while the individual influence of Asian economies in \nglobal  bodies  has  increased,  their  collective  impact  could  be  much \ngreater if they acted in concert.\n\nCrises can have very different impacts on regional cooperation. The \n1997/98 crisis led to a plethora of government-led regional cooperation \n\n102\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\ninitiatives and the formalization of \u201cEast Asia\u201d as a region. While the \nrecent one has exposed outstanding weaknesses, it is also galvanizing \nAsia to play a role commensurate with its growing economic strength \nin reshaping the global financial architecture.\n\n3.3. Institutional Design\n\nInstitutional design can play a key role in overcoming the barriers to \nsustained cooperation discussed above, not least differing preferences \nor  concerns  over  sovereignty  (defined  as  policy-making  autonomy). \nDecision  rules,  legalization  (including  the  delegation  of  authority \nto  regional  institutions),  and  rules  governing  enfranchisement  and \nmembership can all help further regional cooperation.\n\nDecision Rules and Side Payments\nDecision  rules  influence  many  aspects  of  cooperative  bargains.  Few \ninternational  institutions  operate  through  the  simple  majority  rules \nwidely  found  in  domestic  democratic  regimes.  Even  in  those  that \nallow simple majorities for certain actions, such as the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), conventions have produced a strong tendency \ntoward consensus decision-making. Majority decision-making among \nparticipants  with  divergent  preferences  over  key  issues  is  likely  to \nproduce substantial and often persistent minorities that are confronted \nwith outcomes they strongly dislike and cannot change. This is a recipe \nfor fracturing an organization composed of nation-states, since the exit \noption is usually readily available.\n\nMost  regional  and  global  institutions  rely  instead  on  consensus \ndecision  rules:  open  opposition  from  a  single  state  can  defeat  any \nproposed  action  or  commitment.52  Consensus  decision-making \nprevents  the  emergence  of  discontented  minorities;  it  also  serves \nas  a  strong  commitment  device,  since  changing  any  agreement  is \ndifficult. This also makes it difficult for an institution to respond quickly \nto  changing  circumstances  (or  crises).  Despite  its  popularity  in  Asia \nand elsewhere, consensus decision-making involves a steep tradeoff \nbetween  commitment  and  decisiveness.  Because  agreements \nreached by consensus are so difficult to change, they are hard to reach \n\n52  Consensus is not the same as unanimity, which requires active support from all members. \n\n103\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nin the first place: bargaining often becomes protracted and may fail. If \nconsensus fails because of a less powerful state or group of states, more \nactivist  and  powerful  states  may  be  tempted  to  proceed  separately. \nConsensus  rules  protect  all  minorities,  constraining  the  powerful  as \nwell as protecting them against actions by a majority of weaker states. \nThe result, however, is often a failure of collective action.\n\nA  particular  interpretation  of  consensus  decision-making,  when \ncombined with complete equality among members, imposes additional \nconstraints  on  institutional  capacity.  In  ASEAN,  for  example,  equal \ncontributions  are  made  to  the  secretariat\u2019s  budget  and  other  funds \nthat  support  ASEAN\u2019s  activities.  If  differential  contributions  became \nthe norm, ASEAN\u2019s richer members would probably insist on a system \nof  weighted  voting,  in  which  decision  rules  reflected  their  greater \ncontributions  to  the  institutional  budget.  Instead,  ASEAN  has  relied \non  voluntary  contributions  from  members  for  specific  purposes, \nsidestepping the difficult issue of changing fundamental decision rules. \nAs  Severino  (2009)  points  out,  despite  ASEAN\u2019s  deep  attachment  to \nconsensus decision-making and the sovereign equality of its members, \ndecision-making efficiency has led to ad hoc qualification of these rules.\nThe shortcomings of consensus decision rules have led to hybrid \nformulas in a few regional organizations where preferences converge on \nkey issues. Typically, these solutions combine some variant of weighted \nvoting, which grants greater voting power to more powerful (or richer) \nstates, with supermajorities, which protect minorities, albeit to a lesser \nextent than consensus decision rules. In the IMF, certain key decisions \nrequire at least 85% of voting shares. In effect, this grants a veto to the \nUS,  whose  quota  is  large  enough  to  form  a  blocking  minority;  other \ngroups, such as the European Union (EU) or developing countries, can \nalso block decisions by acting together. In the EU, systems of qualified \nmajority  voting  in  the  European  Council,  which  brings  together  the \nleaders of national governments, have combined larger vote shares for \nmore populous members with the requirement of supermajorities that \nhave varied in size over time (Hix 2009). Under such systems, states that \ncontribute more resources receive greater formal influence through the \nvoting rules and can also be reassured that smaller (and often poorer) \nstates will not be able to extract additional resources from them at will. \nSmaller states can be confident that they will not be swamped by great-\npower blocs. The recent multilateralization of the CMI represents the \nfirst  major  step  in  an  Asian  regional  institution  toward  such  a  hybrid \nvoting formula. Its rules will permit decisive action in a financial crisis \nwhile protecting the interests of the largest states, which are providing \nmost of the funds for the CMI (Haggard 2009).\n\n104\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nA related mechanism that serves to placate discontented minorities \nand  encourage  their  continued  collaboration  is  compensation\u2014\nside payments to those who might be disadvantaged by a particular \ncollective agreement. Side payments may take any number of forms, \nfrom financial compensation to assistance on other issues of interest \nand  even  minor  gestures  that  provide  political  prestige.  Institutional \ndesign can make the provision of side payments more or less difficult. \nIn Asia, concessions to the most recent ASEAN entrants (Cambodia, \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam)  during \nthe  negotiation  of  the  Initiative  for  ASEAN  Integration  (IAI)  suggest \nthat compensation is most often needed to win the consent of poorer \nmembers to cooperative agreements that may benefit richer members \ndisproportionately (Haggard 2009). Box 3.3 considers the role of side \npayments in international cooperation.\n\nCommitment Devices\nDecision  rules  are  critical  to  reaching  regional  agreements  and  may \nalso  help  prevent  collective  backsliding.  They  are  less  effective, \nhowever,  against  defection  by  individual  governments.  Particularly \nwhen  new  commitments  concern  the  deepening  of  economic \nintegration\u2014thereby venturing into politically sensitive new domains \nand  arousing  opposition  from  a  new  array  of  interest  groups\u2014it \nmay  be  tempting  to  renege  on  (or  fail  to  implement)  agreements. \nCommitment mechanisms embedded in regional institutions can help \nbind a government and its successors.\n\nThe mobilization of high-level political commitment has often been \nessential for the launch of new institutions; it provides a necessary sign \nof commitment to both regional and domestic audiences. The direct \ninvolvement of national political institutions, such as legislatures and \nbureaucracies, reinforces regional commitments by making them truly \nintergovernmental, rather than \u201cinter-executive\u201d (Dominguez 2009).\n\ninstrument \n\ninstitutional \n\nAnother  valuable \n\nfor  strengthening \ncommitments  to  cooperate  is  legalization.  This  is  defined  by  three \nmeasures:  the  precision  of  international  commitments,  the  degree \nto  which  those  commitments  are  legally  binding,  and  the  authority \ndelegated to third parties, particularly global or regional institutions, for \ninterpreting, monitoring, and enforcing those commitments (Goldstein \net  al.  2001).  One  or  more  dimensions  of  legalization  can  substitute \nfor  others:  rather  than  elaborate  regional  institutions  with  delegated \nauthority, precise and binding commitments may create incentives for \ncompliance.\n\n105\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBox 3.3. Role of Side Payments in International Cooperation\n\nSide  payments  can  enable  members  of  an \n\ninstitution for regional integration to integrate \nmore  rapidly  by  increasing  incentives  for \nparticipation  and  compliance  and  offsetting \nsovereignty costs\u2014most directly through transfers \nor  joint  policies  with  a  redistributive  component. \nSuch redistributive bargains have been important \nin  Europe\u2019s  integration,  but  have  so  far  featured \nless in Asia.\n\nintervened  heavily \n\nConsider  Europe\u2019s  Common  Agricultural \nPolicy  (CAP).  In  1962,  the  six  original  European \nEconomic  Community  member  governments, \nwhich  all \nin  agriculture, \nagreed  to  integrate  their  markets,  coupled  with \ncommunity  preference  and  \u201cfinancial  solidarity\u201d \nunder  which  the  costs  of  farm  support  would \nbe  shared.  In  effect,  German  industry  would \ngain  access  to  the  French  market  and  Germany \nwould provide indirect support to French farmers \nthrough the CAP. This aid, in turn, would weaken \npolitical  resistance  and  build  support  for  deeper \nintegration.  Germany  remains  the  largest  net \ncontributor  to  the  European  Union  (EU)  budget, \nnearly 50% of which goes to agriculture.\n\nRegional policy in Europe is another example. \nAs well as assisting backward regions, it has aimed \nfrom  the  outset  to  offset  the  effects  of  industrial \nchange  and  structural  unemployment  associated \nwith  deeper  integration.  The  Single  European \nAct  of  1986  led  to  a  \u201ccohesion  policy\u201d  to  help \ndisadvantaged  regions  adjust  to  the  rigors  of  the \nEU single market. As with the CAP, regional policy \nalso  aims  to  boost  commitment  to  European \n\nintegration  by  compensating  regions  and  sectors \nadversely affected by it.\n\nto \n\ntied \n\nloosely \n\nSide  payments  are  scarcely  used  to  achieve \ndeeper  cooperation  in  East  Asia.  The  Initiative \nfor ASEAN Integration is a modestly redistributive \nprogram \nthe  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  Free  Trade  Area,  but \nit  is  not  linked  to  particular  commitments.  The \nAsia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  ECOTECH \nprogram  of  economic  and  technical  cooperation \nis  justified  as  a  necessary  complement  to  its \ntrade  and  investment  liberalization  agenda,  but \nits capacity building is not linked to liberalization \ncommitments,  which  are  scarcely  binding.  One \nreason  why  side  payments  have  been  limited  in \nAsia and the Pacific is that there is little incentive \nto make such transfers to secure agreement when \ncommitments  are  nonbinding.  Also,  countries \nfinancing  such  transfers  will  wish  to  influence \ndecision-making  and  the  organizations  to  which \nredistribution is delegated.\nCreating  dedicated \n\nintegration \nfunds  that  would  lend  or  make  transfers  subject \nto  voluntary\u2014but  monitored\u2014commitments  to \naccelerate compliance with regional commitments \nmight  advance  matters.  Such  funds  could  either \nbe  directed  to  disadvantaged  regions  (as  in \nEurope)  or  finance  projects  to  ease  adjustment, \nfor example through labor training schemes. Such \nlending  or  transfers  might  also  encourage  the \nlending for infrastructure that supports the deeper \nintegration of disadvantaged regions.\n\nregional \n\nNational  governments  often  resist  the  delegation  of  authority  to \nglobal  and  regional  institutions  intent  on  demonstrating  their  policy \nautonomy, even when that autonomy has been deeply compromised \nby  economic  integration.  This  resistance  also  reflects  a  realistic \n\n106\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nassessment of risks to principals (member governments) that delegate \ntasks to institutional agents, which may fail to implement governments\u2019 \npreferences.\n\nThe  dynamics  of  delegation  vary  with  the  nature  of  the  task \nassigned  to  a  regional  institution.  The  least  demanding,  because \nthey  involve  the  smallest  transfer  of  authority,  are  information \ngathering  and  research.  But  even  such  modest  tasks  may  help \nsustain  national  commitments  to  regional  agreements  through  peer \npressure  on  recalcitrant  members.  More  significant  commitment \nmechanisms  include  the  direct  monitoring  of  member  states  and \ntheir implementation of agreements. A further delegation of authority \ninvolves  the \ninterpretation  of  agreements  and  adjudication  of \ndisputes through dispute settlement mechanisms situated in regional \ninstitutions. The most substantial of these are regional courts, which \nhave become significant in areas ranging from human rights to trade \nand investment (Voeten 2009).\n\nDelegation  is  not  accurately  measured  by  the  elaboration  of \nregional institutions: too often these ambitious blueprints do not actually \nexercise  the  powers  awarded  on  paper.  On  any  measure,  however, \nnational governments have delegated relatively little authority to Asian \nregional institutions. The Asian Development Bank stands out as the \nmost  prominent  example  of  consequential  delegation  to  a  regional \ninstitution. ASEAN has a small secretariat of just 70 professional staff \nwhose operational autonomy has long been closely circumscribed by \nmember countries. APEC has no real permanent secretariat; most of \nits planning is implemented by officials from the country hosting the \nleaders\u2019 summit.\n\nThis  pattern  of  limited  delegation  may  be  changing,  however. \nASEAN\u2019s  new  charter  formally  empowers  its  secretariat  to  monitor \ncompliance  by  member  countries.  Through  the  CMI\u2019s  \u201cIMF  link,\u201d \nregional governments have effectively delegated conditionality to the \nIMF  for  large-scale  lending.  Devices  that  national  governments  may \ndeploy  in  order  to  limit  a  regional  institution\u2019s  policy  independence \ninclude  requiring  a  unanimous  intergovernmental  decision  for  any \ndelegation of authority, rules governing representation on the regional \nexecutive  that  ensure  its  preferences  are  close  to  those  of  member \ngovernments,  and  high  thresholds  for  the  adoption  of  any  initiatives \nfrom  the  regional  executive  to  ensure  a  high  degree  of  consensus  \n(Hix 2009).\n\nAnother  commitment  device \n\nthe  enfranchisement  of \nnongovernment  actors.  Despite  the  intergovernmental  character  of \nregional  institutions,  nongovernmental  actors  may  be  permitted  to \n\nis \n\n107\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nparticipate  in  them.  Rules  for  enfranchisement  in  regional  courts, \nfor  example,  are  central  to  their  effectiveness  (Voeten  2009). \nGiven  the  reluctance  of  governments  to  deploy  regional  dispute \nsettlement  mechanisms  against  their  regional  partners,  activation \nby  private  actors\u2014\u201ccooperators\u201d  who  lie  outside  the  cartel  of \nnational  governments\u2014has  been  essential  to  the  empowerment \nof  regional  courts  in  the  interests  of  regional  economic  integration. \nWhen  national  governments  agree  to  slow  integration  or  renege  on \ntheir  regional  commitments,  private  actors  who  would  benefit  from \nfurther  integration  are  able  to  use  regional  institutions  to  reactivate \nthe integration process, interpret the rules that have been agreed, and \nprevent backsliding by governments.\n\nMembership Rules and the Widening  \nof Regional Institutions\nMembership  rules  are  particularly  important  for  the  widening  of \neconomic integration. In integrating Asia, membership rules will play \na central role in the extension of policy cooperation beyond East and \nSoutheast Asia to South and Central Asia.\n\nAs  Kelley  (2009)  describes,  regional  institutions  tend  to  fall  into \ntwo broad membership models. Club models impose strict admission \ncriteria, which can encompass economic and regulatory harmonization \nwith  existing  members,  additional  liberalization,  and  commitments \nto  respect  human  rights  or  the  rights  of  national  minorities.  In  other \nwords,  under  the  club  model,  admission  requirements  give  existing \nmembers leverage over a prospective member\u2019s policies. The convoy \nmodel is more permissive. All states within a particular geographical \narea (ASEAN) or on a more or less ad hoc basis (APEC) are candidates \nfor  membership,  with  few  stipulations  for  policy  change  in  advance \nof accession. As these examples suggest, Asian regional organizations \nhave typically chosen the convoy model.\n\nBoth models\u2014and the many variants that lie between them\u2014have \nstrengths  as  regional  institutions  seek  to  expand  their  geographical \nscope.  Convoy  organizations  primarily  use  socialization  to  shape \nthe  behavior  of  new  members;  their  effectiveness  seems  greatest \nin  the  security  domain,  where  inclusiveness  is  particularly  valuable. \nClub  institutions  have  a  wider  array  of  instruments  with  which  to \nshape  the  behavior  of  prospective  and  current  members  (Kelley \n2009).  As  cooperation  deepens,  however,  the  bar  for  new  members \nbecomes higher. In some cases, when disagreement over the content \n\n108\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nof  the  cooperative  bargain  grows  too  great,  club  institutions  will \nmove  toward  segmentation  (those  who  wish  to  move  ahead  with \ncooperation  in  new  domains  may  form  separate  institutions  for  that \npurpose)  or  differentiated  membership  categories  within  the  same \norganization.  If  members  agree  on  common  goals  for  integration, \nmultispeed integration may be adopted, allowing lengthy transitional \nperiods  or  \u201copt-outs\u201d  for  new  members.  If  disagreement  over  the \naims of integration is more profound, variable geometry or \u00e0 la carte \nregionalism  may  be  required.  Under  these  rules,  a  single  institution \nrecognizes  different  \u201cintegration  spaces.\u201d  For  example,  several  older \nmembers of the EU have opted out indefinitely of membership of the \neuro (variable geometry), while newer members have yet to satisfy its \nmembership criteria (multispeed membership).\n\nAlthough these alternatives permit groups of \u201ccooperators\u201d within \na  large-membership  organization  to  proceed  with  their  preferred \nprojects, new or aspiring members are not always less keen on closer \nintegration.  India,  for  example,  appears  most  interested  in  regional \nagreements that would liberalize trade in services and establish rules \ngoverning foreign direct investment, two  areas  of deeper  integration \n\nBox 3.4. Measuring Institutional Effectiveness\n\nAn  accurate  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness \n\nof  regional  institutions  must  begin  with  a \nreasonable benchmark of success and then \ndefine a strategy for estimating effectiveness. Overall \neconomic  performance  is  not  a  fair  benchmark, \nsince  the  positive  effects  of  regional  economic \nintegration  may  be  swamped  by  domestic  policy \nerrors  or  external  (global)  shocks.  An  institution\u2019s \neffectiveness  can  also  be  measured  against  its \nfounding  mandate,  but \nthe  charters  of  most \ninternational  and  regional  institutions  incorporate \nvery  broad  goals  with  few  precise  deadlines  for \nachieving them. Such institutional mandates ensure \nthat every institution receives a pass grade.\n\nA \n\nfairer\u2014though \n\nstill  difficult\u2014standard \nfor  measuring \nthe  effectiveness  of  regional \ninstitutions  involves  estimating  their  influence  on \n\nthe  regional  agreements \n\nregional economic integration itself. This requires \ndefining \nthat  have \npromoted  liberalization  and  integration,  as  well \nas  estimating  their  effects  on  national  policies. \nEven  regional  institutions  that  appear  effective \nin  promoting  integration  are  not  uniformly  so. \nDetermining  regional  institutions\u2019  influence  on \nnational policies, a key measure of their success, \nis more difficult still. Even the effectiveness of the \nWorld Trade Organization, when measured by its \neffects  on  national  policies,  has  been  contested \n(Rose  2004;  Goldstein,  Rivers,  and  Tomz  2007a, \n2007b).  Measuring  the  compliance  effects  of \ninternational institutions and agreements with any \nprecision remains difficult because of the daunting \ncounterfactual: what would national policies have \nbeen in the absence of regional institutions?\n\n109\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nthat many Southeast and East Asian trade agreements have excluded \n(Debroy  2009).  Box  3.4  considers  how  to  measure  institutions\u2019 \neffectiveness.\n\n3.4. Conclusion\n\nInstitutions  for  regional  integration  vary  in  response  to  the  demands \nthat  they  satisfy  and  the  supply  conditions  under  which  they  are \nfounded  and  operate.  Economic  integration  (or  its  absence)  can \ncreate  three  types  of  demand  from  governments:  the  provision  of  a \ncollective  barrier  to  policy  backsliding  (consolidation),  commitment \nmechanisms to guarantee the removal of behind-the-border barriers \nto  exchange  (deepening),  and  a  means  for  broadening  economic \nintegration,  incorporating  previously  disconnected  members  in  the \ngrowing  web  of  economic  interdependence  (widening).  When  the \nglobal  environment  produces  negative  economic  shocks,  demand \noften  grows  for  regional  institutions  to  buffer  those  shocks  and \ninfluence global institutions and negotiations.\n\nA  region\u2019s  initial  characteristics  can  exert  a  persistent  influence \nover  the  shape  of  its  regional  institutions.  Heterogeneity  on  several \ndimensions\u2014income  disparities,  regime  type,  level  of  economic \nintegration\u2014produces  convergent  or  divergent  preferences  over \neconomic cooperation and institutions. The distribution of economic \nand military power within a region, when combined with great-power \nrivalries,  can  increase  or  reduce  the  supply  of  regional  institutions. \nExternal  actors  may  possess  leverage  that  undermines  or  supports \nregional  collaboration.  None  of  these  characteristics  is  necessarily \nfatal  to  regional  institution  building,  but  an  institution\u2019s  effectiveness \ndepends on designing it to offset their effects.\n\nThe dynamics of institution building vary. Economic ties and security \nrelations can reinforce or offset one another: a region of military allies, \nsuch  as  the  North  Atlantic,  is  more  likely  to  integrate  economically \nthan one of military rivals, such as South Asia. As economic integration \nproceeds, strong feedback effects may strengthen integration and the \ninstitutions that support it. The degree of competition among global, \nregional,  and  subregional  institutions  also  varies.  Global  institutions \nprovide an alternative outlet for trade-dependent interests that desire \nfurther  liberalization.  Subregional  institutions  that  provide  more \neffective,  small-membership  venues  for  collaboration  may  hamper \nwider  regional  aggregations.  Regional  dynamics  are  also  influenced \n\n110\n\n\fDesigning Effective Regional Institutions \n\nby contingent events. Two are particularly important: the appearance \nof  political  entrepreneurs  who  link  domestic  politics  and  regional \ncontext, and exogenous shocks, notably economic crises.\n\nis  crucial \n\nInstitutional  design \n\nin  enabling  collaborating \ngovernments  to  overcome  the  liabilities  and  constraints  of  their \nparticular  regional  settings.  Decision  rules  influence  an  institution\u2019s \ntradeoff  between  commitment  and  decisiveness,  as  well  as  ensure \nthat  discontented  minorities  do  not  defect.  Several  commitment \nmechanisms  embedded  in  regional  institutions  serve  to  preserve \nbargains  and  discourage  defection:  the  mobilization  of  high-level \nlegalization,  and  delegation  to  regional \npolitical  commitments, \nauthorities. The enfranchisement of pro-cooperation interests outside \nthe  circle  of  governments\u2014whether  corporations,  nongovernmental \norganizations, or individuals\u2014serves the same purpose. Membership \nrules are critical to the widening of regional institutions and integration; \nthe choice of membership model also serves to preserve the original \ncooperative bargains.\n\nFor  integrating  Asia,  designing  effective  regional  institutions  for \nthe consolidation, deepening, and widening of economic integration \nis  paramount.  Is  the  creation,  redesign,  or  strengthening  of  regional \ninstitutions  essential  for  this  critical  economic  agenda?  If  the \neconomic benefits from these regional institutions are substantial, will \nthose benefits outweigh the perceived loss of sovereign autonomy in \nsetting  national  policies?  An  answer  to  these  questions  requires  first \nan  audit  of  Asia\u2019s  existing  (and  changing)  institutional  architecture \n(Chapter 4), and then a comparison of Asia\u2019s institutional record with \nthe experience of other regions (Chapter 5).\n\n111\n\n\f\fChapter 4\n\nAnatomy of Institutions  \nfor Regional Integration\n\n\fChapter 4\n\nAnatomy of Institutions  \nfor Regional Integration\n\nin  Asia \n\nW hile  regional  cooperation \n\nis  often \ndescribed  as  \u201cinstitution-light,\u201d  Asia \nin  fact \nhosts  a  dense  web  of  regional  institutions  and \narrangements\u2014albeit  ones  that  tend  to  have \nfew delegated powers. This chapter presents an \ninventory and description of 40 of the region\u2019s institutions for regional \nintegration (IRIs).\n\nIRIs  are  classified  by  remit  and  by  geographical  reach.  Those \nwith  an  economic  mandate  are  categorized  as  overarching\u2014\numbrella  arrangements  with  comprehensive  purviews;  functional\u2014\nspecialized  institutions  with  a  narrower,  often  technical  agenda;  or \nfacilitating\u2014institutions  that  bolster  regional  integration  by  providing \nadvisory,  administrative  and  technical,  and  financial  support.  IRIs \nare  also  categorized  geographically  as  subregional\u2014covering  all  or \npart  of  Central,  South,  Northeast,  and  Southeast  Asia  or  the  Pacific; \nintraregional\u2014covering  at  least  two  but  not  all  subregions;  pan-\nAsian\u2014covering all of Asia\u2019s subregions; or transregional\u2014linking Asia \nto other regions of the world.\n\nFigure  4.1  summarizes  the  Asian  IRIs  in  this  inventory,  which  are \nalso  listed  in  Chapter  1  (Table  1.1).  Table  4.A1  (in  the  Appendix  to  this \nchapter) provides a sense of the regional coverage and functional areas of \ncollaboration of various IRIs in Asia and the Pacific, while short profiles of \neach institution are included in Appendix 2 at the end of the book.\n\nThis  chapter  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  4.1  sketches  the \nattributes  of  overarching,  functional,  and  facilitating  institutions. \nThe  subsequent  sections  look  in  greater  depth  at  Asia\u2019s  various \nIRIs.

Intraregional IRIs are considered in Section 4.4, pan-Asian \nones in Section 4.5, and transregional ones in Section 4.6. Section 4.7 \nlooks at Asia\u2019s security institutions and Section 4.8 concludes.\n\n4.1. Typology of Institutions\n\nOverarching.  Overarching  IRIs  are  umbrella  arrangements  with \ncomprehensive  purviews.  They  may  be  based  on  a  vision  of  an \nintegrated  regional  economy  and  creating  a  single  regional  market \nand  regional  community.  They  convene  summits  of  heads  of \ngovernment/state  and/or  ministerial-level  meetings,  and  provide  the \nnormative  and  declaratory  frameworks  that  legitimize  and  support \nregional cooperation and integration. This study\u2019s stocktaking exercise \nlists  10  overarching  organizations  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  Examples \ninclude ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and the South Asian \nAssociation  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  at  the  subregional \nlevel; ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN+3) and the East Asia Summit (EAS) \nat  the  intraregional  level;  and  the  Asia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM)  and \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) at the transregional level.\n\n115\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nAsia\u2019s overarching IRIs have a number of common attributes. They \nare  intergovernmental  arrangements  that  typically  make  decisions \nbased on consensus rather than majority voting. Their mandates and \nmodalities  are  largely  advisory:  in  many  cases  they  are  consultative \nforums  whose  agreements  lack  legal  force  rather  than  regulatory \nagencies  empowered  to  regulate  their  members\u2019  behavior  in  legally \nbinding ways. Notable exceptions, in some areas, include APEC and \narguably  ASEAN,  although  their  agreements  tend  to  be  non-binding. \nFew have dispute-settlement mechanisms. Although most overarching \nIRIs enjoy the direct involvement of heads of state and/or government \nthrough  regular  summits,  national  agencies  usually  delegate  little \npower  or  authority  to  these  organizations  and  their  established \nsecretariats  tend  to  have  limited  financial  and  human  resources. \nTable 4.1 highlights the features of Asia\u2019s various overarching IRIs.\n\nHow  do  overarching  organizations  in  the  various  subregions \ncompare?  Despite  the  apparent  complexity  and  comprehensiveness \nof  regional  cooperation  in  Southeast  Asia,  ASEAN  involves  little \ndelegation,  relying  on  \u201coffshoots\u201d  rather  than  independent  agencies \nto implement policy, as Section 4.2 explains. With its charter, however, \nASEAN has begun to shift from a purely deliberative, process-oriented \narrangement  towards  a  more  rules-based,  regulatory,  and  results-\noriented one, although it still makes decisions by flexible consensus.\n\nPIF  is  also  intergovernmental,  with  deliberative  remits,  but  it \ndisplays  a  greater  semblance  of  delegation  and  arguably  a  slightly \nmore  systematic  feedback  mechanism\u2014the  Regional  Institutional \nFramework\u2014than other overarching institutions, including ASEAN. While \nSouth Asia\u2019s IRIs are in general smaller and weaker than those in other \nsubregions, SAARC involves, in certain respects, slightly more delegation \nthan  ASEAN.  Its  regional  centers  enjoy  greater  budget  autonomy  than \nthe various offshoots of ASEAN that manage similar areas of technical \ncooperation.53 On paper, SAARC\u2019s secretariat has a similar, if not more \nextensive, remit than ASEAN\u2019s does. In practice, ASEAN\u2019s secretariat has \nacted as an important catalyst of cooperation programs in Southeast Asia \nand beyond. It has helped to create groups such as ASEAN+3 and the \nEAS and its secretary-general and the rotating ASEAN Chair have been \ninvited to participate in G20 meetings since 2009.\n\nFunctional.

Their  objective \nis  to  solve  those  problems  through  collective  action,  as  well  as  by \nexchanging  and  adopting  best  practices.  In  doing  so,  they  develop \norganizational structures that help sustain regional cooperation. As a \nconsequence, functional IRIs that enjoy some measure of delegation\u2014\n\n54  The ASEAN Regional Forum, a security institution, is also classified as a functional IRI.\n\n117\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nparticularly  institutions  in  the  Pacific  and  South  Asia\u2014are  arguably \nmore \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d processes.\n\nThere are a host of such institutions in Asia and the Pacific: this \nstudy\u2019s  stocktaking  exercise  identified  as  many  as  28.  These  are \nusually created without a lofty \u201cidea of region\u201d in mind, but they can \nhelp create a habit of regional cooperation and perhaps also regional \nconfidence  building.  Both  are  essential  elements  of  regionalism.  In \nmany  ways,  the  attributes  and  features  of  functional  IRIs  differ  little \nfrom those of overarching ones (Table 4.2).\n\nFacilitating. Facilitating institutions are organizations that bolster \nregional  integration  by  providing  advisory,  administrative,  technical, \nand  financial  support  (Abe  2009).  In  a  sense,  they  are  \u201cservice \nproviders\u201d  for  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  At  the  global \nlevel,  facilitating  institutions  include  the  World  Bank,  the  United \nNations  Development  Programme  and  others  that  support  regional \nand subregional initiatives. At the pan-Asian level, the two facilitating \nIRIs are the United Nations (UN) Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nwhich are discussed in greater detail in Section 4.5.\n\nESCAP  supports  various  programs  and  projects  to  strengthen \nregional  economic  integration  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  notably  the \nAsian Highway and the Trans-Asian Railway programs. It also provides \nexpert  advice  to  government  agencies  on  economic  development \nissues and supports trade facilitation programs and various capacity-\nbuilding efforts, often in collaboration with other institutions, including \naffiliated organizations from the UN system.\n\nADB also provides considerable resources and institutional support \nto regional cooperation and integration in Asia and the Pacific through \nseveral  initiatives,  including  subregional  programs\u2014organized  and \nimplemented in collaboration with national and regional agencies\u2014\nsuch  as  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC), \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) economic cooperation program, \nand the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC).\n\nIn  geographical  areas  where  overarching  institutions  are  either \nweak  or  non-existent,  facilitating  IRIs  play  key  roles,  particularly  as \n\u201chonest  brokers,\u201d  in  helping  functional  institutions  contribute  to \nregional  cooperation  and  integration.  However,  strategic  decisions  on \nregionalism remain the purview of national governments and (to some \nextent) overarching IRIs, with facilitating IRIs striving instead to ensure \nthat ownership of the programs and initiatives they finance and support \nrests with national governments and civil society. Facilitating IRIs are also \nincreasingly called on by Asian countries to provide welfare assistance, \ntrust funds and other crisis-mitigating measures (Arner 2009).\n\n118\n\n\fAnatomy of

ASEAN and Other Southeast \nAsian IRIs\n\nEstablished in 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nand Thailand, ASEAN was the first regional institution in Asia comprised \nsolely of indigenous Asian powers.55 It has since expanded so that by \n1999 it included all ten countries in Southeast Asia. (Timor-Leste, which \nachieved independence from Indonesia in 2002, has stated its intention \nto join the group in due course.) What began as a modest institution \nfocusing  on  economic  and  security  cooperation  is  now  arguably \none  of  the  most  successful  expressions  of  regional  cooperation  in \nthe  developing  world,  one  based  on  the  principles  of  openness  and \ngradualism\u2014and  a  model  of  soft  regionalism  and  intergovernmental \ncooperation for other overarching institutions in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nThe  traditional  \u201cASEAN  way\u201d  involved  cooperation  through \ninformal  understandings  that  impose  no  legally  binding  obligations, \nbased on the principles of non-interference in national affairs and equal \nbudget contributions. However, cooperation within ASEAN is starting \nto  become  more  rules-based  and  more  formally  institutionalized. \nWhile  this  shift  remains  tentative  and  incomplete,  ASEAN  leaders \nhave  recently  introduced  some  important  innovations.  Since  2003, \nthey have sought to establish an ASEAN Community comprising three \n\u201cpillars\u201d:  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community  (AEC),  to  be  created  by \n2015,  and  the  ASEAN  Political-Security  Community56  and  the  ASEAN \nSocio-Cultural  Community,  both  of  which  are  expected  to  be  fully \noperative  by  2020.  In  2005,  ASEAN  leaders  began  drafting  a  charter, \nwhich came into force in 2008, for the organization to strengthen its \ninstitutional pillars, bolster efforts to achieve the ASEAN Community, \nand  give  greater  legal  force  to  its  international  commitments.  Thus \nASEAN  is  gradually  shifting  from  being  an  organization  based  on \npolitical  dialogue  to  one  with  an  international  legal  status,  involving \nbinding commitments, and that is better equipped to respond to the \nemerging regional and global challenges (Severino 2009).\n\nASEAN\u2019s  highest  decision-making  body  was  initially  the  foreign \nministers\u2019 meeting. In 1976 and 1977, ASEAN leaders\u2019 first and second \nsummits raised the organization\u2019s international profile. Building on the \n\n55  Non-Asian countries participated in the Bandung Conference, organized in 1955, in the \n\nSoutheast Asia Treaty Organization, which lasted from 1955 until 1977, and are members of \nthe Secretariat of the Pacific Community, established in 1947 and still active.\n\n56  Formerly known as the ASEAN Security Community. \n\n121\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n1971 Declaration on Southeast Asia as a Zone of Peace, Freedom and \nNeutrality (ZOPFAN), ASEAN agreed its first treaty, the Treaty of Amity \nand Cooperation (TAC). Together, these enabled ASEAN to formulate \nbasic  norms  and  principles  to  govern  relations  among  states  in  the \nregion  as  well  as  with  external  powers.  However,  political  tensions \nbetween Malaysia and the Philippines prevented a third summit being \nheld  until  1987  and  economic  initiatives  in  these  first  two  decades \nachieved relatively few results.57 Eventually, ASEAN got a new lease of \nlife when in 1992 leaders decided to create the ASEAN Free Trade Area \n(AFTA).  Thereafter  ASEAN  leaders  met  again  every  three  years  until \n2001, since when they have held summits annually.\n\nASEAN\u2019s  secretariat  initially  had  limited  powers,  since  national \ngovernments  did  not  want  to  cede  control  over  the  institution\u2019s \ndevelopment.58  Since  the  mid-1980s,  however,  successive  eminent-\npersons groups\u2019 reports have argued that it ought be strengthened\u2014and \nit now has many more powers than a decade ago as well as a broader \npool of professional staff. However, it still lacks financial and human \nresources,59 and the powers that national agencies have delegated to \nit remain limited to managing the (as-yet-unused) dispute-settlement \nmechanism and monitoring the implementation of the AEC (through \na  scorecard  mechanism  which  is  meant  to  exert  peer  pressure  on \nmembers when their performance falls short of their commitments). \nThe  issue  of  dispute  settlement  within  ASEAN  is  analyzed  in  greater \ndetail in Box 4.1.\n\nAs  its  agenda  has  expanded,  ASEAN  has  become  a  much  more \ncomplex  institution.  Until  the  1980s,  it  had  a  simple  organizational \nstructure involving the five original members and Brunei Darussalam, \nwhich  joined  in  1984.  Its  projects,  which  focused  on  economic \ncooperation,  were  initiated  and  managed  by  committees  comprising \ngovernment  officials.  Yet  these  projects  had  scarcely  any  impact \non  Southeast  Asia\u2019s  growing  economic \nintegration,  which  was \nmostly  driven  by  individual  countries\u2019  own  liberalization  policies  and \nsupported by increased foreign direct investment (FDI) by multinational \ncompanies from non-ASEAN economies. However, ASEAN was quite \n\n57  The key initiatives in the economic field began with the ASEAN Preferential Trade Agreement \nand the ASEAN Industrial Projects in 1977. They were followed by the ASEAN Industrial Joint \nVenture, the ASEAN Industrial Complementation, and other schemes, all with disappointing \nresults.\n\n58  The Secretariat was set up in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 1976 by ASEAN\u2019s foreign \n\nministers. \n\n59  Major ASEAN decision-making bodies, in addition to the Leaders\u2019 Summit, are Senior \n\nOfficials Meetings in various areas and High-Level Task Forces created for specific needs \nand activities. On the limitations of the ASEAN Secretariat, see Severino (2006).\n\n122\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nBox 4.1. Dispute Settlement in ASEAN\n\nW hile  the  founding  document  of  the \n\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN),  the  Bangkok  Declaration  of \n1967,  made  no  mention  of  a  dispute-settlement \nmechanism,  the  concept  appeared  for  the  first \ntime in the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality \n(ZOPFAN)  treaty  of  1971.  Through  the  Declaration \nof  ASEAN  Concord,  issued  at  the  first  ASEAN \nSummit in 1976, members then committed to \u201crely \nexclusively on peaceful processes in the settlement \nof  intraregional  differences.\u201d  The  Treaty  of  Amity \nand  Cooperation  (TAC)  of  1976  also  provided  for \na  ministerial-level  High  Council  to  settle  internal \ndisputes  among  members. \nIn  2001,  ASEAN \nintroduced new procedural rules allowing for non-\nregional signatories involved in a dispute to sit on \nthe  High  Council,  an  important  development  that \npaved  the  way  for  external  powers  (the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China [PRC] in 2003, France in 2007, and \nthe United States in 2009) to accede to the TAC. The \nASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea (1992) \nand  the  Declaration  on  the  Conduct  of  Parties  in \nthe South China Sea (2002), inked between ASEAN \nand  the  PRC,  also  emphasize  peaceful  dispute \nsettlement and the exercise of mutual restraint.\n\nSo  far,  however,  ASEAN  members  have  not \nused \nthese  dispute-settlement  mechanisms. \nInstead, as permitted by the TAC, they have made \nuse  of  dispute  settlement  in  higher  jurisdictions \nunder global agreements, such as the International \nCourt  of  Justice  (ICJ)  or \nthe  World  Trade \nOrganization. For example, ASEAN countries have \nasked  the  ICJ  to  arbitrate  in  bilateral  territorial \ndisputes\u2014between  Indonesia  and  Malaysia  over \nSipadan and Ligitan (2002) and between Malaysia \nand Singapore over Pulau Batu Puteh (2008).\n\nOn  the  economic  front,  the  2004  ASEAN \nProtocol  on  Enhanced  Dispute  Settlement \nMechanism and the 2007 ASEAN Charter serve as \na  background  framework  for  dispute  settlement. \nThe  ASEAN  Charter,  in  particular,  provides  a \ncomprehensive  framework  for  the  settlement  of \nongoing and future disputes. Reinforcing the TAC\u2019s \nprinciples,  the  ASEAN  Charter  authorizes  the \nASEAN  Chair  and/or  its  secretary-general  to  offer \ntheir  good  offices  to  engage  in  conciliation  and \nmediation  whenever  disputes  arise.  Unresolved \ndisputes  and  non-compliance  with  dispute-\nsettlement  arbitrations  are  to  be  referred  to  the \nASEAN Summit.\n\nsuccessful in the security and political areas, and it played an important \nrole in helping to resolve the Cambodian conflict (Severino 2009).\n\nASEAN\u2019s ten members remain diverse in terms of their declared \npolitical  and  ideological  backgrounds,  and  while  the  very  large \nincome  gap  among  them  is,  on  average,  slowly  closing,  some  have \nmuch more advanced economies than others. The group has a very \nbroad agenda, and initiatives are taken with the direct involvement of \npolitical leaders. Meetings of economic and other ministers, prepared \nby  senior  officials,  direct  its  work.  Under  the  new  charter,  these  are \nnow  organized  into  three  Councils  of  Ministers,  each  charged  with \nrealizing  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  the  ASEAN  Community,  and  all \nreporting directly to the ASEAN Summit.\n\n123\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nThe ASEAN Charter, introduced in November 2007, establishes ASEAN \nas  a  rules-based  institution  with  binding  legal  obligations.  It  improves \nthe  organization\u2019s  compliance  mechanisms,  streamlines  its  decision-\nmaking structure, and extends its dispute-settlement mechanism. Since \nASEAN  is  at  the  core  of  many  regional  and  subregional  schemes,  the \nASEAN  Charter\u2019s  impact  could  be  felt  more  widely:  it  is  an  important \nstep forward not only for ASEAN itself but also for the development of \nAsia\u2019s regional institutions more generally. Some important institutional \ninnovations introduced by the ASEAN Charter are discussed in Box 4.2.\n\nBox 4.2. Institutional Innovations Introduced by the ASEAN Charter\n\nThe  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n\n(ASEAN)  Charter,  which  entered  into  force \nin  December  2008,  states  that  the  goal  of \neconomic  integration  among  its  members  is  the \ncreation  of  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community \n(AEC) as a single market and production base by \n2015.  To  that  end,  the  ASEAN  Charter  introduces \nnew  mechanisms  to  monitor  compliance  with \nagreements  and  decisions.  It  directs  the  ASEAN \nSecretary-General  to  monitor  compliance  with \ndispute-settlement  rulings,  report  on  this  to  the \nASEAN  Summit,  and  mediate  between  parties \nto  a  dispute,  if  requested.  Separately,  ASEAN \neconomic ministers have drawn up a \u201cscorecard\u201d \nto  track  compliance  with  the  group\u2019s  economic \nagreements and decisions.\n\nThe  ASEAN  Charter  also  establishes  a  new \nimportant  body:  the  Committee  of  Permanent \nRepresentatives,  charged  with  guiding  and \nsupporting the activities of the ASEAN Secretariat and \nother bodies. It tasks ASEAN national secretariats with \ncoordinating at a national level the implementation \nof its agreements and decisions. The ASEAN Charter \nalso  clarifies  the  group\u2019s  decision-making,  giving \nASEAN  leaders  the  authority  and  responsibility  for \nresolving\u2014including  by  voting\u2014issues  that  cannot \nbe  settled  by  consensus  at  lower  levels.  Once  the \nCommittee of Permanent Representatives is up and \n\nrunning, day-to-day decision-making is expected to \nbe speedier and more streamlined.\n\nThe  ASEAN  Charter  also  doubles  the  number \nof deputy secretaries-general from two to four, with \nthe  aim  of  improving  the  operations  of  the  ASEAN \nSecretariat and the bodies it serves. The designation \nof  a  single-country  chairperson  for  most  ASEAN \nbodies,  also  provided  by  the  ASEAN  Charter,  is \nexpected to help tighten coordination more generally.\nIn  addition  to  the  existing  dispute-settlement \nmechanism  for  economic  issues,  the  ASEAN \nCharter  directs  that  member  countries  \u201cmaintain \nand  establish  dispute  settlement  mechanisms \nin  all  fields  of  cooperation.\u201d  A  High-Level  Legal \nExperts Group is currently working out the details \nof such mechanisms. In all cases, disputes are to \nbe settled peacefully.\n\nRemarkably for a body founded on the principle \nof  non-interference  in  members\u2019  domestic  affairs, \nthe  ASEAN  Charter  also  establishes  an  ASEAN \nIntergovernmental  Commission  on  Human  Rights, \nwhose  terms  of  reference  have  already  been \nadopted and members appointed. The commission \naims to promote the observance of human rights in \nthe region, help build member states\u2019 capacity to do \nso, and monitor compliance with the principles and \npurposes as defined in the ASEAN Charter\u2014which \ninclude human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\n124\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nDespite  its  recent  progress,  ASEAN  still  faces  many  challenges. \nFor  instance,  although  national  secretariats  located  in  individual \nmember countries were strengthened, tasking them with coordinating \nimplementation  at  a  national  level  does  not  ensure  that  ASEAN\u2019s \ndecisions\u2014and  member  states\u2019  own  commitments\u2014will  actually \nbe  implemented.  In  addition,  while  the  secretary-general\u2019s  role  in \nmonitoring compliance has been enhanced, the position will continue \nto be non-renewable and rotate alphabetically among member states.60\nReforms  are  also  needed  in  other  areas.  The  system  of  equal \nfinancial  contributions  has  held  the  secretariat\u2019s  operational  budget \nhostage  to the group\u2019s  smallest  economies. The  consensus rule can \nhamstring decision-making. The ASEAN Secretariat continues to have \ndifficulty recruiting qualified staff and thus strengthening its institutional \ncapacity, partly on account of the shortness of tenure offered. In the \nabsence of a strong central authority, ASEAN continues to rely primarily \non  the  collective  will  of  its  member  states,  their  perceived  national \ninterests, and peer pressure to ensure compliance with its agreements \nand decisions.\n\nCreating  the  AEC  and  making  it  a  viable  instrument  to  support \nsustainable  and  equitable  growth  among  ASEAN  members  is  the \nbiggest challenge. A majority of Asian opinion leaders interviewed in \nthe survey conducted for this study expressed concerns on the capacity \nto start the AEC by 2015 (see Appendix 1). In order to ensure a smooth \nand timely AEC start, ASEAN leaders have agreed to implement several \nliberalization  and  harmonization  efforts  and  to  establish  an  ASEAN \nInfrastructure Fund with an initial capital of $800 million. At the 2010 \nHanoi  Summit  they  adopted  a  Master  Plan  on  ASEAN  Connectivity. \nThis aims to facilitate the realization of the AEC by enhancing regional \ninfrastructure  development,  improving  economic  efficiency,  and \neventually narrowing the income gap among and within members.\n\nASEAN Functional Initiatives\nASEAN organizes functional cooperation in Southeast Asia in a wide \nrange  of  areas  through  various  agencies  that  implement  regional \nprograms under its umbrella. Examples include the Centre for Energy \nand the Centre for Biodiversity, both of which originate from programs \nundertaken with the European Union (EU) and are governed by boards \n\n60 \n\nIn the case of the deputy secretaries-general, two of the positions will continue to rotate \nalphabetically among member states, while the other two will be \u201copenly recruited based \non merit.\u201d\n\n125\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nmade up of ASEAN senior officials and the ASEAN secretary-general. \nOther bodies of this nature include the Earthquake Information Centre, \nthe  Coordinating  Centre  for  Transboundary  Haze  Pollution,  and  the \nSpecialized Meteorological Centre in areas related to the environment; \nand the Centre for the Development of Agricultural Cooperatives and \nthe Council on Petroleum in areas of industrial development. ASEAN \nhas  also  established  its  own  foundation  to  handle  funding  from \nexternal parties and other contributions from donors. In education and \ncapacity building, the group has also established the ASEAN University \nNetwork and the Insurance Training and Research Institute. Another \nimportant  group  in  the  field  of  education  is  the  Southeast  Asian \nMinisters  of  Education  Organization,  which  predates  ASEAN.  This \nalso  includes  Timor-Leste  and  several  advanced  countries  from  the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as \nassociate members.\n\nAmong the various functional initiatives for economic cooperation \nintroduced by ASEAN so far, AFTA is the most successful one. Launched \nin 1992 to increase the group\u2019s \u201ccompetitive advantage as a production \nbase geared for the world market\u201d (ASEAN 2003), AFTA has worked \nas  an  effective  tool  to  promote  trade  liberalization,  institutionalize  a \nconstructive dialogue among its members, and introduce a practice of \nadhering to reciprocal commitments. Earlier proposals for creating a \nfree trade area (FTA) led to no results because some ASEAN members \nwished to make their domestic markets more efficient before lowering \ntariff  barriers.  By  the  early  1990s,  however,  ASEAN  countries  were \nable to remove their major objections as they successfully undertook \ndomestic reforms. AFTA was seen as a way to lock in those reforms \nthrough  regional  commitments,  especially  for  the  most  advanced \nmembers.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997/98 \nand in response to the rise of\u2014and increased competitive challenge \nfrom\u2014the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  India,  AFTA\u2019s \nimplementation was accelerated. This was followed by the decision \nto  establish  the  ASEAN  Community  in  2003,  which  consolidates  all \nearlier  agreements  into  a  more  coherent  plan  to  deepen  regional \nintegration. In recent years, ASEAN has also signed FTAs with Australia, \nNew  Zealand,  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  PRC,  and  India. \nDiscussions  are  ongoing  to  identify  common  denominators  among \nthese FTAs and work towards their consolidation under a region-wide \ntrade and investment agreement (see Section 4.4).\n\n126\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nOther Functional IRIs in Southeast Asia\nThis  study\u2019s  stocktaking  covers  five  additional  functional  IRIs  in \nthe  Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines  East \nSoutheast  Asia: \nASEAN  Growth  Area  (BIMP-EAGA);  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \n(GMS)  Economic  Cooperation  Program;  the  Indonesia-Malaysia-\nThailand  Growth  Triangle  (IMT-GT);  the  Mekong  River  Commission \n(MRC);  and  the  Southeast  Asian  Water  Utilities  Network  (SEAWUN). \nAll are linked to ASEAN, are building blocks towards achieving the AEC \nmainly through the realization of infrastructure connectivity projects, \nand  receive  support,  in  varying  degrees,  from  ADB.  Southeast  Asia \nalso hosts other functional IRIs not included in this inventory, notably \nnongovernmental ones.\n\nThe  idea  of  creating  \u201cgrowth  triangles\u201d  among  border  areas \nof  neighboring  countries  emerged  in  the  early  1990s  as  Southeast \nAsia experienced a boom in FDI inflows that spurred economic and \nindustrial growth. Countries began to implement programs for regional \ncooperation  in  developing  poles  of  economic  growth  across  border \nterritories. IMT-GT and BIMP-EAGA were inspired by an earlier initiative \nthat included Singapore, the state of Johor in Malaysia, and the Riau \nIslands  of  Indonesia.  IMT-GT  covers  Indonesia\u2019s  island  of  Sumatra, \nNorthern  Peninsular  Malaysia,  and  Thailand\u2019s  southern  provinces; \nBIMP-EAGA  includes  Brunei  Darussalam,  Eastern  Indonesia,  East \nMalaysia, and Southern Philippines.\n\nFormed  in  1993,  the  IMT-GT  aims  to  promote  economic  growth \nin some of the least-developed provinces of Indonesia, Malaysia, and \nThailand by mobilizing public and private sector funds to make the most \nof local endowments, especially natural resources. It aims to facilitate \nthe flow of goods and services to lower costs and exploit economic \ncomplementarities within the subregion (Severino 2009). The Centre \nlocated  within  Malaysia\u2019s \nfor  IMT-GT  Subregional  Cooperation, \nEconomic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department, serves as \nits secretariat.61 Its strategies and projects for 2007\u20132011 are set out in \nthe IMT-GT Roadmap for Development adopted at the second summit \nof political leaders in 2006. A blueprint for projects\u2019 implementation in \n2012\u20132016 is expected to follow. IMT-GT leaders\u2019 meetings are usually \norganized back-to-back with ASEAN ones.\n\nThe  BIMP-EAGA  initiative  was  launched  in  1994  with  a  similar \npurpose of encouraging development in poorer provinces, notably by \n\n61  Malaysia\u2019s federal government is funding the budget of the Centre for IMT-GT Subregional \n\nCooperation for five years, until 2013.\n\n127\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\npromoting  trade,  tourism,  and  environmental  protection.62  The  BIMP-\nEAGA Facilitation Center, established in 2003 in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, \nfunctions  as  the  group\u2019s  secretariat,  coordinating  its  operations  and \nsupporting the implementation of its activities. BIMP-EAGA\u2019s Business \nCouncil  promotes  private-sector  participation  in  its  operations  and \ngovernance. Member countries\u2019 participation in the initiative is ensured \nthrough  national  secretariats,  while  the  main  intergovernmental \nconsultative  forum  and  platform  for  cooperation  is  the  annual  BIMP-\nEAGA  Senior  Officials  and  Ministers  Meeting.  BIMP-EAGA\u2019s  current \noperations are guided by the Roadmap to Development (2006\u20132010). \nThis focuses on (i) promoting tourism, trade, and investment in priority \nsectors,  especially  in  projects  with  high  impact  on  the  development \nof  small  and  medium  enterprises;  (ii)  managing  natural  resources, \nprotecting  biodiversity,  and  promoting  sustainable  development; \n(iii) developing infrastructure to facilitate regional economic integration; \nand (iv) strengthening institutional development.\n\nThe GMS is a program launched and largely funded by ADB that \nadopts a more comprehensive approach to subregional development \nthan IMT-GT or BIMP-EAGA. Started in 1992 to promote economic growth \nthrough  closer  economic  linkages,  GMS  now  covers  a  wide  range  of \nactivities. These include cross-border projects to develop infrastructure \n(in transport, energy, and telecommunications), facilitate trade, promote \nagriculture and tourism, facilitate private sector development, protect \nthe environment, and build capacity for human resource development. \nCovering  the  territories  of  the  Mekong  river  basin,  it  links  the  PRC\u2019s \nYunnan  Province  and  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  with  five \nASEAN members: Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. As the GMS includes the four \npoorest ASEAN countries, it is a program that supports the narrowing of \nincome gaps within the subregion, thereby complementing\u2014from an \nASEAN perspective\u2014the Initiative for ASEAN Integration.\n\nThe GMS program\u2019s institutional structure is increasingly directed \nand  organized  by  its  member  countries.  In  addition  to  an  annual \nministerial conference, three summits among GMS leaders have been \norganized. An action plan was introduced in 2004 at the 13th Ministerial \nConference in Vientiane, Lao PDR, to implement GMS activities in the \n\n62  This proposition refers in particular to Malaysia\u2019s Sabah and Sarawak; Indonesia\u2019s \n\nKalimantan, Sulawesi, and Irian Jaya; and the Philippines\u2019 Mindanao and Palawan. These \nregions are in strategic proximity to each other, relatively distant from their national \ncapitals, but at the same time very rich in natural resources.\n\n128\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nstrategic  framework  for  2002\u20132011.63  A  total  of  $11  billion  has  been \nspent  on  GMS  projects,  focusing  on  priority  regional  infrastructure, \nsuch as the upgrading of the Phnom Penh\u2013Ho Chi Minh City highway \nand the East-West Economic Corridor that will eventually extend from \nMyanmar\u2019s coastal areas on the Andaman Sea to Da Nang in Viet Nam. In \naddition to the traditional focus on strengthening subregional transport \nconnectivity, a new generation of projects under consideration seeks \nto deepen economic integration and sustainable competitiveness, as \nwell as promoting a closer sense of community among GMS members. \nThe GMS strategic framework for 2012\u20132022 is expected to reflect this \nchange in priorities and focus on environmental and software aspects \nof regional cooperation.\n\nEstablished in 1995 by the governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam,  the  MRC  seeks  to  promote  cooperation  in \nensuring the sustainable development of the Mekong River basin, with \nthe PRC and Myanmar as dialogue partners.64 Its four members have \nagreed to jointly manage their shared water resources in the Mekong \nand jointly develop the river basin\u2019s economic potential. The MRC also \nhelps its member countries achieve the UN Millennium Development \nGoals.  Its  secretariat  provides  technical  and  administrative  support \nto  the  MRC\u2019s  Council  and  Joint  Committee,  its  other  two  major \ninstitutions.  The  secretariat\u2019s  main  office  is  in  Vientiane,  Lao  PDR, \nwith  an  additional  office  in  Phnom  Penh,  Cambodia.  The  leaders \nof MRC countries met for their first summit in April 2010 in Hua Hin, \nThailand, where they signed the Mekong Agreement. This recognizes \nthe  strategic  importance  of  regional  cooperation  for  the  sustainable \nmanagement  of  water  resources  to  promote  economic  and  social \ndevelopment in the river basin. \n\nThe  SEAWUN  is  an  organization  of  national  water  associations \nand  water  supply  and  sanitation  utilities  from  Indonesia,  Lao  PDR, \nMalaysia,  the  Philippines,  Singapore,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  It  was \nestablished with ADB support in 2002 and provides training programs \nas well as promotes information exchange among its members.\n\n63  The three GMS leaders\u2019 summits were organized in 2002 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in \n\n2005 in Kunming, PRC, and in 2008 in Vientiane, Lao PDR.\n\n64  Due to its vital environmental and economic importance, the Mekong River basin has a \n\nlong tradition of international cooperation: the UN has funded the activities of the Mekong \nCommittee since 1951.\n\n129\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n4.3. IRIs in Other Asian Subregions\n\nCentral Asia. This is the only subregion in Asia that lacks an indigenous \noverarching institution. As Central Asian countries that emerged from \nthe breakup of the Soviet Union had to focus on building (or rebuilding) \ntheir national identities, regional cooperation has struggled to become \nthe priority it ought to be. Even so, recent progress has been substantial.\nNone of ADB\u2019s members from Central Asia\u2014Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan, \nand  Uzbekistan\u2014host  the  secretariat  of  a  major  regional  IRI:  the \nEurasian Economic Community (EurAsEc) is based in Moscow, Russian \nFederation,  the  Shanghai  Cooperation  Organisation  (SCO)  in  Beijing, \nthe  PRC,  and  the  Economic  Cooperation  Organization  (ECO),  which \nbring together non-Arab Islamic countries, in Tehran, Iran. Central Asia \nis,  however,  home  to  three  functional  IRIs\u2014the  CAREC  Program,  the \nInternational Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), and the United Nations \nSpecial Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA).65\n\nA  program  involving  a  partnership  between  eight  countries \nand  six  multilateral  institutions,  CAREC  has  evolved  into  the  most \neffective functional IRI in Central Asia by adopting a gradual strategy \nand encouraging ownership by member countries, and thanks to the \ndeployment  of  substantial  resources  from  ADB,  including  financial \nand  staffing  support.  Other  factors  behind  its  success  are  that  it \npresents  no  serious  threat  to  the  sovereignty  of  its  members,  and \nthat  the  membership  of  a  large  neighbor  (the  PRC)  is  welcomed \nrather  than  feared.  While  ADB,  as  the  lead  institution,  has  devoted \nconsiderable  effort  to  acting  as  CAREC\u2019s  secretariat,66  the  presence \nof  other  major  multilateral  institutions  brings  in  potential  donors \nand alleviates concerns of domination by an outside body. CAREC\u2019s \nactivities aim to improve connectivity, share natural resources more \nefficiently,  shorten  transit  times  across  national  borders  for  traded \ngoods,  and  introduce  clear,  consistent  trade  regimes.  In  2006,  it \nadopted  its  Comprehensive  Action  Plan  that  proposed  a  results-\noriented program with tangible targets and outputs, based on country \nownership,  pragmatic  approaches,  and  mutual  accountability,  and \nfocused on four priority areas: transport, trade facilitation, trade policy, \nand energy (Pomfret 2009).\n\nSPECA  has  so  far  had  less  impact  in  promoting  regionalism \nin  Central  Asia.  Its  main  agenda  includes  encouraging  industrial \n\n65  These institutions are discussed at length in Pomfret (2009).\n66  ADB has a dedicated unit to CAREC within its Central and West Asia Regional Department.\n\n130\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nrestructuring and competition, facilitating energy and water-resource \nmanagement, attracting FDI, and developing infrastructure, especially \nin transport and communication. Although two UN commissions (that \nfor Europe and that for Asia and the Pacific) support SPECA, it lacks \nfinancing  and  dedicated  SPECA  offices  in  either  of  them.  In  2005, \nSPECA embarked on institutional reforms to improve its performance \n(Pomfret 2009).\n\nWhile  the  environmental  catastrophe  resulting  from  the  gradual \ndisappearance of the Aral Sea is IFAS\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre, its effectiveness \nhas been hampered because many Central Asian governments have \nfailed  to  make  its  agenda  a  national  priority.  Regional  governments \nhave  scarcely  begun  to  address  matters  of  principle,  let  alone  the \ndifficult and highly political issue of how to share scarce water supplies. \nPoor governance has also resulted in corruption problems, alienating \nexternal donors and causing funding for IFAS to dry up (Pomfret 2009).\nNortheast Asia. Until recently, economic cooperation in Northeast \nAsia  was  mostly  driven  by  a  few  functional  initiatives,  although \ncountries  have  also  acted  through  the  Six-Party  Talks  to  address \nsecurity concerns related to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \n(DPRK). Wider and more ambitious cooperation programs have lagged \nbehind other subregions because of remaining historical animosities \namong regional members and a preference for bilateralism. However, \nthe PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea have started to strengthen \ntheir  economic  cooperation  initiatives  within  ASEAN+3  (described \nin  Section  4.4),  which  was  formed  in  response  to  the  1997/98  Asian \nfinancial  crisis.  While  leaders  of  these  \u201cPlus  Three\u201d  countries  have \nbeen meeting on the sidelines of ASEAN+3 meetings since 1999, they \nalso formalized their higher-level cooperation in December 2008 with \nthe launch of the Trilateral Summit (TS), an embryonic but promising \noverarching IRI.\n\nThe TS has already spurred cooperation among think tanks in the \nthree countries to explore modalities for economic cooperation, including \nthe desirability and feasibility of a free trade area.67 Since the first official \nmeeting  of  leaders  from  the  three  TS  countries  in  2008,  the  group\u2019s \nagenda has expanded to include security and environmental protection. \nThe PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea have also committed 80% \nof  the  funding  for  the  Chiang  Mai  Initiative  Multilateralization  (CMIM) \nand, given their economic importance, are likely to play a key role in the \n\n67  Kikuchi (2009) argues that a successful Trilateral Summit could supplant the ASEAN+3 or \nEAS as the focus of regional integration, while cautioning that it is an institution that is still \nin search of identity.\n\n131\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\ndevelopment of broader region-wide institutions. However, it remains \nto be seen whether they can set aside their nationalist differences and \nstrengthen the TS into a viable subregional IRI.\n\nThe  wider  Northeast  Asian  subregion  has  witnessed  limited \nfunctional  cooperation  to  promote  economic  development  through \nthe  Greater  Tumen  Initiative  (GTI).  Supported  by  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the GTI brings together the PRC, the Republic \nof Korea, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation, while Japan has observer \nstatus. The UN secretariat responsible for the GTI is based in Beijing, PRC. \nWhile the GTI was not very active in its first decade, more recently GTI \nleaders have identified four energy-based activities as key components \nin  its  Strategic  Action  Plan  for  2006\u20132015:  energy  policy  coordination \nand  cooperation;  capacity  building;  enhancing  transparency;  and \npartnership  building.  GTI  activities  are  carried  out  through  the  help  of \nenergy  commissions,  financial  institutions,  research  institutes,  and \nother relevant bodies (Gulidov 2009). While the GTI has great economic \npotential,  political  divisions  and  the  DPRK\u2019s  attitude  towards  nuclear \npolicy make cooperation quite difficult. The broader question is whether \nby  creating  structures  for  dialogue  and  efforts  to  undertake  concrete \nprojects, GTI has the potential to become a confidence-building process \nthat improves the political environment in the subregion.\n\nPacific Islands. The South Pacific Commission was the first formal \nregional arrangement in Asia and the Pacific. It was established in 1947 \nby the region\u2019s colonial powers to coordinate research on economic \nand social development. Now known as the Secretariat of the Pacific \nCommunity (SPC), its membership includes all 22 independent states \nand territories in the Pacific region plus Australia, France, New Zealand \nand the United States (US). While it is overseen by a governing council \nconsisting of heads of state and government, it remains a non-political \nbody that specializes in providing technical advice, including data on \neconomic  and  social  development  and  the  management  of  natural \nresources.\n\nThe  subregion\u2019s  overarching  institution  is  the  PIF\u2014previously \nknown  as  the  South  Pacific  Forum.  It  is  the  forum  where  political \ndecisions  are  taken  and  its  membership  is  limited  to  16  sovereign \nstates.  Its  annual  Forum  Leaders  Meeting  seeks  to  develop  collective \nresponses to regional issues. Decisions are reached by consensus. The \nPacific  Islands  Forum  Secretariat  (PIFS),  based  in  Suva,  Fiji  Islands, \ndevelops policies and a work program based on leaders\u2019 decisions and \nis  also  charged  with  their  implementation.  The  PIFS  grew  out  of  the \nSouth Pacific Bureau for Economic Cooperation (SPEC), an organization \nfounded in 1973 to foster economic cooperation and trade in the region.\n\n132\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nThe PIFS has a stronger mandate from national governments than \nthe ASEAN Secretariat. In addition to its role in harmonizing regional \npositions on various political and policy issues, the PIFS has technical \nprograms  that  cover  economic  development,  transport,  and  trade. \nIt  has  four  divisions\u2014development  and  economic  policy;  trade  and \ninvestment;  political,  international,  and  legal  matters;  and  corporate \nservices\u2014each  with  direct  responsibility  for  a  range  of  programs  to \nimprove the capacity of PIF member countries and coordinate action \non  matters  of  common  interest.  PIFS  has  a  secretary  general,  and \nits  activities  are  overseen  by  a  governing  body,  the  Forum  Officials \nCommittee, made up of PIF government representatives.\n\nThe PIF\u2019s agenda focuses on schemes to pool resources across the \nPacific\u2019s often tiny states. Priorities include infrastructure development \nand regional connectivity. Implementation is undertaken by functional \nIRIs  such  as  the  SPC,  the  Pacific  Islands  Applied  Geoscience \nCommission  (SOPAC),  and  others.  PIF  members  have  formed  free-\ntrade agreements, namely the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic \nRelations (PACER) and the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement \n(PICTA). However, as their implementation has been less successful \nthan planned, PIF members have responded by seeking to consolidate \nthe activities of IRIs in the Pacific through the creation of the Pacific \nPlan\u2014an  overarching  agreement  endorsed  by  PIF  leaders  in  2005 \nto  unite  the  region\u2019s  trade-integration  efforts  (PACER  and  PICTA) \nand  to  promote  broader  development  aspirations.  The  Pacific  Plan \nhas  also  proposed  consolidating  the  subregion\u2019s  IRIs  into  a  regional \norganization structure based on three pillars: a political one based on \nPIF, a technical one focused on SPC, and an academic one comprising \ninstitutions such as the South Pacific Board for Educational Assessment, \nand the University of the South Pacific (Chand 2009).\n\nThe  study\u2019s  stocktaking  exercise  counts  five  functional  IRIs  in \nthe  Pacific  that  play  a  role  in  developing  and  implementing  regional \ncooperation  programs.  These  institutions  tend  to  focus  on  specific \nareas of cooperation, such as fisheries (the Forum Fisheries Agency\u2014\nFFA), the environment (the Pacific Regional Environment Programme\u2014\nSPREP), applied geoscience (SOPAC), and tourism (the Pacific Tourism \nOrganization),  in  addition  to  technical  support  provided  by  SCP  in \nseveral  areas.  Not  all  are  delegated  tasks  by  the  PIF,  although  some \nemerged as offshoots from it. All these functional institutions rely heavily \non donor funding and are therefore beholden to the agendas of their \nmajor  sponsors.  They  often  compete  for  the  same  sources  of  funds, \nshifting accountability for deliverables from clients to donors. The PIF \nSecretary General\u2014who serves as the permanent chair of the Council \n\n133\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nof Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP), which includes these \nfive IRIs\u2014reports on their activities to the PIF Summit.\n\nSince the regional architecture in the Pacific includes a panoply of \ninstitutions that have sprung up in response to emerging needs rather \nthan  by  design,  the  CROP  has  an  important  role  to  play  in  ensuring \nregional  coherence  and  the  consistency  of  various  initiatives  and \nprograms that promote regionalism. In particular, the CROP conducts \na review of Pacific IRIs\u2019 effectiveness under the Regional Institutional \nFramework. This exercise, started as one of the initiatives to implement \nthe Pacific Plan, seeks to develop an effective feedback mechanism \nwhich in many respects appears to be more systematic than ASEAN\u2019s \nad hoc review processes (Chand 2009).\n\nSouth Asia. South Asia\u2019s overarching IRI is SAARC, which includes \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, \nplus Afghanistan (which joined in 2007). Launched in 1985 as South \nAsian Regional Cooperation (SARC), SAARC has a secretariat located \nin  Kathmandu,  Nepal.  SAARC\u2019s  creation  has  been  described  as  \u201can \nact  of  faith\u201d  given  the  absence  of  a  shared  security  threat  and  the \nextremely  low  levels  of  intraregional  trade  and  investment  (Baru \n2009). Tensions and conflicts in South Asia remain a major obstacle to \nregional cooperation.\n\nSAARC  began  life  as  a  low-profile  intergovernmental  institution, \nserved  by  a  small  secretariat.  Its  founding  charter  provides  for  an \nannual  leaders\u2019  summit,  but  does  not  explicitly  define  its  function. \nThe  Council  of  (Foreign)  Ministers  is  entrusted  with  formulating \npolicies,  reviewing  progress,  and  making  decisions  on  new  areas  of \ncooperation, as well as establishing implementation mechanisms as \nnecessary. It is assisted by a standing committee consisting of senior \nofficials  from  members\u2019  foreign  ministries.  Technical  committees \nimplement, coordinate, and monitor the progress of SAARC\u2019s activities. \nThis is similar to ASEAN\u2019s early institutional structure.\n\nUntil  1991,  SAARC\u2019s  role  in  trade  liberalization  was  practically \nnonexistent.  With  the  SAARC  Preferential  Trading  Arrangement \n(SAPTA),  signed  in  1993  and  entered  into  force  since  1995,  SAARC \nhas gathered momentum by focusing on opportunities for economic \ncooperation and collaboration with civil society. The SAARC Secretariat \nalso prioritizes regional connectivity and human development, while \nit has  more recently started to  play a  role in coordinating  members\u2019 \npolicy responses to external shocks such as the 2008/09 global crisis. \nHowever, the implementation of SAARC\u2019s South Asia Free Trade Area \n(SAFTA), signed in 2004 and entered into force since 2006, has so far \ndone little to boost intraregional trade.\n\n134\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nBased  on  a  recommendation  from  an  eminent-persons  group, \nSAARC has started working towards the formation of a more effective \nfree  trade  area  by  2016.  Under  an  early-harvest  program,  India, \nPakistan, and Sri Lanka have reduced customs duties on imports from \nleast-developed countries to below 5% from January 2009. Especially \nsince  the  1980s,  all  SAARC  economies  have  introduced  trade  policy \nand  other  reforms  and  become  more  outward-oriented.  However, \nSAFTA faces many hurdles, not least political ones (such as the refusal \nby Pakistan and Bangladesh to grant India transit rights).\n\nSAARC\u2019s  technical  committees  (and  working  groups)  bring \ntogether experts from member countries in areas such as infrastructure, \nscience  and  technology,  human  development,  and  energy.  A  key \ninstitutional  innovation  is  the  creation  of  13  \u201cregional  centers\u201d\u2014all \noffshoots  of  SAARC\u2014which  focus  on  specific  programs  to  facilitate \nregional cooperation at the ground level. Each center\u2019s capital cost and \nadministrative budget are borne by the respective host country, which \ngives them a degree of autonomy, while program budgets are shared \nby  all  member  governments  in  proportion  to  their  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP).  These  regional  centers  are  overseen  by  the  SAARC \nSecretariat,  which  reports  on  their  activities  to  the  SAARC  Summit. \nThe  centers\u2019  activities  are  approved  by  the  Program  Committee  and \nthe  SAARC  Summit,  while  implementation  responsibility  rests  with \nhost-country  governments.  Ostensibly,  then,  SAARC  involves  rather \nextensive delegation to separate institutions. Baru (2009) argues that \nthe  proliferation  of  these  regional  centers  seems  to  be  a  reaction  to \nthe slow progress of SAARC itself. Box 4.3 considers how trade within \nSouth Asia and with East Asia might be liberalized.\n\nTo  sum  up,  there  are  many  IRIs  in  the  five  subregions  of  Asia \nand  the  Pacific.  All  have  an  overarching  IRI  except  Central  Asia, \nwhere a functional IRI is at the center of regional cooperation. While \nsubregional IRIs have achieved a lot, politics and capacity constraints \nremain big hurdles to closer cooperation.\n\n4.4. Intraregional Institutions\n\nIn the wider Asian context, this study\u2019s stocktaking exercise identifies \n11 intraregional IRIs: two overarching and nine functional. By gathering \nas  members  of  an  intraregional  IRI,  Asian  countries  belonging  to \ndifferent  subregions  create  new  \u201cregional  identities\u201d  and  \u201cbridges\u201d \nacross  subregions.  While  the  ambitiousness  of  intraregional  IRIs\u2019 \nobjectives  varies,  they  tend  to  maintain  loose  institutional  structures \n\n135\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBox 4.3. Liberalizing Trade within South Asia and with East Asia\n\nThe efforts of the South Asian Association for \n\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) to liberalize \ntrade  among  its  members  and  with  other \ncountries could be made more effective in several \nways.  First,  SAARC\u2019s  liberalization  agenda,  such \nas  the  offer  of  duty-free  access  to  developing \ncountries,  could  be \nfast-tracked,  a  measure \nthat  India  has  already  taken.  Second,  countries \ncould  harmonize  testing  and  certification  as \nwell  as  promote  the  mutual  recognition  of \ntechnical  standards.  Trade  facilitation  also  offers \nsubstantial gains. Trade and transit arrangements \nbetween  India  and  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  Bhutan, \nand  Pakistan,  as  well  as  between  Bangladesh, \nNepal  and  Bhutan,  and  between  Pakistan  and \nAfghanistan, could be greatly improved. All forms \nof transport infrastructure also need improvement. \nThere  is  potential  as  well  for  liberalization  and \nincreased trade in services and even energy. Cross-\nborder  investment  should  also  be  liberalized\u2014\nIndia is already a significant investor in Sri Lanka \nand  Nepal,  while  Sri  Lankan  companies  are  also \nexpanding their investment in India.\n\nWhile trade and economic relations between \nSouth  and  East  Asian  countries  have  recently \nincreased (see Chapter 2), they remain limited, for \nseveral reasons. First, despite some liberalization, \ntrade  and  investment  regimes  in  the  SAARC \nregion are still restrictive, with tariffs, quantitative \nrestrictions,  non-tariff  barriers,  and \nlimits  on \nforeign direct investment (FDI). Second, domestic \n\nreforms have not occurred fast enough and many \ninstitutional  and  systemic  constraints  remain. \nExamples  include  taxation  issues,  labor  laws, \nentry and exit problems, complicated procedural \nlaws,  credit  shortages,  skills  shortages,  poor \npower  and  transport  infrastructure,  and  policies \nthat discourage the transitions from rural to urban \nareas and informal businesses to formal ones. The \nSAARC region performs poorly in many governance \nand  \u201cdoing  business\u201d  surveys,  underlining  the \nneed for domestic and internal reforms.\n\nManufacturing  is  also  a  much  lower  share  of \nthe economy in most South Asian countries than it \nis in East Asia. Manufacturing growth is constrained \nby  the  institutional  problems  mentioned  above. \nReforms are needed to attract FDI to South Asia and \nensure  that  South  Asian  countries  become  more \nintegrated  into  the  global  manufacturing  supply \nchains  that  involve  East  Asian  countries.  There  is, \nhowever,  limited  evidence  of  that  happening  in \nsectors  such  as  electronics,  automobiles,  textiles \nand garments, and chemicals. FDI is also important \nas  it  can  ease  supply  rigidities  in  smaller  South \nAsian economies. Policy cooperation could play an \nimportant role in integrating East and South Asia\u2019s \nmanufacturing  sectors  as  agreements  on  trade \nfacilitation can fast-track integration through mutual \nrecognition of standards, accreditation, elimination \nof  non-tariff  measures,  and  introduction  of  trade \nfinancing programs, as well as the introduction of \nspecial business visas.\n\n136\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nand  received  few  delegated  powers  from  national  agencies,  usually \nlimited to deliberative functions. They also tend to remain based on \nconsensus,  with  generally  weak  or  non-existent  secretariats  (Tan \n2009b).\n\nASEAN+3  and  the  EAS,  the  two  overarching  intraregional  IRIs \nanalyzed in this study, are both part of ASEAN\u2019s institutional complex.68 \nThe processes established to manage these two institutions fall in large \npart  under  ASEAN\u2019s  operational  structure  and  are  serviced  by  units \ncreated  within  the  ASEAN  Secretariat.  While  ASEAN\u2019s  importance \nis  enhanced  by  its  balancing  function  among  big  regional  players \nsuch as the PRC and Japan, those big players also shape the agenda \nof  ASEAN+3,  as  does  the  Republic  of  Korea.  Within  the  EAS,  India \nis  also  important,  as  is  Australia.  The  EAS  connects  countries  from \nfour different subregions\u2014Southeast, Northeast, and South Asia, plus \nOceania\u2014going beyond the East Asia-only members of ASEAN+3. In \na sense, then, the creation of EAS in December 2005 can be seen as a \nfirst step towards a broader pan-Asian institution.\n\nThis study identifies ESCAP and ADB as the only two existing pan-\nAsian IRIs (discussed in the next section). While the Central Banks of \nSouth East Asia, New Zealand, and Australia (SEANZA) brings together \n20 countries and 24 central banks covering different Asian subregions, \nit  lacks  members  from  Central  Asia.  The  importance  of  developing \nnew pan-Asian institutions and forums is discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nIntraregional  functional  IRIs  include  different  types  of  groups \npromoting economic development and cooperation such as the Bay of \nBengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation \n(BIMSTEC),  the  Economic  Cooperation  Organization  (ECO),  and  the \nShanghai  Cooperation  Organisation  (SCO);  institutions  for  financial \ncooperation  such  as  the  ASEAN+3  Macroeconomic  Research  Office \n(AMRO),  the  Credit  Guarantee  and  Investment  Facility  (CGIF),  the \nExecutives\u2019  Meeting  of  East  Asia  Pacific  Central  Banks  (EMEAP),  and \nSEANZA, as well as agencies providing regional public goods such as \nthe Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) and the Network of Asian River Basin \nOrganizations (NARBO). A brief discussion of these institutions is offered \nafter reviewing Asia\u2019s overarching intraregional IRIs.\n\n68  The idea of an \u201cASEAN complex\u201d of institutions is from Haggard (2009). \n\n137\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nOverarching Intraregional IRIs\nASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN+3). ASEAN+3 is the IRI most representative \nof East Asia geographically, since the PRC, Japan and the Republic of \nKorea  participate  actively  with  the  ten  ASEAN  countries  to  promote \nregional cooperation and integration in the wider East Asian region. It is \nAsia\u2019s most advanced intraregional venture: it has pursued collaboration \nin  20  or  more  areas,  notably  financial  matters,  giving  grist  to  the \nsuggestion that it ought to continue serving as East Asia\u2019s \u201cintegrative \ncenter\u201d  and  vanguard  institution  for  regional  integration  (Dent  2009). \nHowever,  the  ASEAN+3  process  remains  weakly  institutionalized: \nit does not have its own secretariat and only a small unit in the ASEAN \nSecretariat is in charge of addressing ASEAN+3 matters.\n\nASEAN+3 has diverse origins. The idea of creating an East Asian \nregional  grouping\u2014initially  named  the  East  Asian  Economic  Group \n(EAEG),  and  subsequently  changed  to  the  East  Asian  Economic \nCaucus (EAEC)\u2014was first mooted in 1990 by the then Prime Minister \nof  Malaysia,  Mahathir  Mohamad.  Beyond  a  few  informal  exploratory \nmeetings, the EAEG or EAEC did not materialize, in part due to APEC\u2019s \ngrowth momentum, but also because the confrontational manner in \nwhich Prime Minister Mahathir at times pushed the idea did not help \nhis cause.\n\nCoordination  among  ASEAN  countries  and  the  PRC,  Japan,  and \nthe  Republic  of  Korea  for  the  ASEM  process  paved  the  way  for  an \nembryonic regionalism at the East Asia\u2013wide level. In the wake of the \n1997/98 Asian financial crisis, the need for closer financial cooperation, \nregional  solidarity,  and  a  stronger  regional  voice  in  the  international \narena  was  increasingly  felt.  ASEAN  took  the  initiative  by  inviting  the \nheads  of  state/government  of  the  three  Northeast  Asian  countries  to \nits 1997 summit. The ASEAN+3 process was formalized in 1999 with \nan agenda initially focused on financial cooperation. In this area, the \ntwo main initiatives that have emerged from the ASEAN+3 process are \nthe Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) and the Asian Bond Markets Initiative \n(ABMI), discussed in Chapter 2 (Arner 2009, Gochoco-Bautista 2009).\n\nThe  CMI,  a  bilateral  swap  arrangement  among  Asian  currencies \ninvolving  the  region\u2019s  monetary  authorities,  was  established  in  2000 \nto  deal  with  liquidity  shortfalls  and  short-term  balance  of  payments \ntransformation  of  bilateral  swap  arrangements \ndifficulties.  The \ninto  a  single  contractual,  multilateral  agreement,  through  the  CMI \nMultilateralization  (CMIM)  process,  has  raised \nthe  prominence \nof  ASEAN+3,  with  important  implications  in  terms  of  the  greater \ninstitutionalization of East Asia\u2019s IRIs. At their May 2009 summit in Bali, \n\n138\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nIndonesia, ASEAN+3 finance ministers reached agreement on all the \nmain  elements  of  the  CMIM  governance\u2014as  Chapter  2  details.  The \nrelative  contribution  shares  and  voting  power  of  each  member  were \ndecided and the size of its reserve pool was increased from $80 billion \nto $120 billion (with the \u201cPlus Three\u201d countries contributing 80% and \nASEAN  countries  the  remaining  20%).  The  CMIM  officially  came  into \neffect on 24 March 2010 and in early May ASEAN+3 finance ministers \ndecided to create the CMIM regional surveillance agency, the ASEAN+3 \nMacroeconomic  Research  Office  (AMRO),  which  is  expected  to \nbecome operative from May 2011 (see below and Chapter 2).\n\nThe  ABMI,  which  began  in  2002,  was  designed  to  promote \nthe  development  of  local  currency\u2013denominated  bond  markets, \nstrengthen Asia\u2019s financial market infrastructure, and increase access \nto regional bond markets by Asian investors. In particular, ABMI seeks \nto develop more efficient, diversified, and liquid capital markets in the \nregion so as to better meet its investment needs and boost economic \ndevelopment (see Chapter 2).69\n\nThe  ASEAN+3  process  has  also  facilitated  regional  cooperation \nin  trade  and  investment.  For  example,  at  the  ASEAN+3  summit  in \n2001, the PRC and ASEAN formally announced that they would start \ntalks  on  a  free  trade  agreement.  The  Republic  of  Korea  used  the \nsame summit to propose a free trade area spanning East Asia, while \nthe PRC proposed the establishment of an East Asia Free Trade Area \n(EAFTA)  involving  all  ASEAN+3  economies,  as  well  as  a  trilateral \nFTA  for  Northeast  Asia  comprising  PRC,  Japan,  and  the  Republic  of \nKorea (Stubbs 2002). Progress towards an EAFTA has, however, been \nslow; at the 2009 ASEAN+3 summit, feasibility studies were still being \nconsidered (ASEAN 2009c). Consolidating the tangled noodle bowl of \nFTAs  into  a  single  East  Asia\u2013wide  FTA  would  benefit  the  region  but \nremains a challenge.\n\nEast  Asia  Summit  (EAS).  In  December  2005,  an  enlarged  \u201cEast \nAsian\u201d  process  came  into  existence  with  the  creation  of  the  EAS, \nextending  the  membership  of  ASEAN+3  to  include  Australia,  India, \nand New Zealand (hence why EAS is also known as ASEAN+6). The \nEAS is a deliberative, consensus-based and process-oriented IRI that \nremains weakly institutionalized. Like ASEAN+3 and ARF, it does not \nhave its own secretariat, relying instead on ASEAN\u2019s.\n\n69  Meanwhile, however, many Asian developing economies\u2014notably the PRC and India\u2014have \nnot yet fully deregulated their capital accounts, creating an obstacle to the development of \nregional financial markets.\n\n139\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nAt its first summit it was agreed that the EAS would be a leaders-led \ndialogue process on strategic issues affecting the region. Its agenda has \nsince expanded rapidly to include energy, trade, and climate change \nissues. More recently, there has been discussion about expanding the \nEAS to include the United States and the Russian Federation.\n\nKey players in the region have been discussing the division of labor \namong  institutions  with  overlapping  memberships,  such  as  ASEAN, \nASEAN+3,  and  the  EAS.  It  has  been  suggested  that  ASEAN  take  the \nlead  in  regional  infrastructure  development,  ASEAN+3  in  financial \nsector development and regional cooperation, and EAS in trade and \ninvestment  cooperation  through  the  proposed  creation  of  a  wide \nregional free trade zone, or the Comprehensive Economic Partnership \nin East Asia (CEPEA).\n\nFunctional Intraregional IRIs\nBay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic \nCooperation (BIMSTEC). BIMSTEC was established in 1997 following a \nproposal by Thailand to help link the Southeast and South Asian regions. \nIts  members  include  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  Myanmar,  Nepal, \nSri Lanka, and Thailand. Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Maldives are the \nSAARC countries which are not members of BIMSTEC. Thailand created \nan earlier group with three South Asian countries, called \u201cBangladesh, \nIndia,  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand  Economic  Cooperation  (BISTEC)\u201d  and \nBISTEC\u2019s  widening  to  BIMSTEC  can  be  seen  as  the  conjunction  of \nThailand\u2019s \u201cLook West\u201d policy and India\u2019s \u201cLook East\u201d policy. BIMSTEC \nhas no secretariat and its activities are coordinated by Thailand\u2019s foreign \nministry,  but  preparations  are  being  made  for  the  establishment  of  a \npermanent secretariat. Its first summit was held in 2004.\n\nBIMSTEC\u2019s  agenda  is  purely  economic,  ranging  from  trade  and \ninvestment initiatives, projects for regional infrastructure development, \nand cooperation to deliver regional public goods. It has so far selected \n13  priority  sectors  for  cooperation,  each  led  by  one  of  the  member \ncountries,  on  a  voluntary  basis.  A  key  area  for  cooperation  is  the \nimplementation of cross-border infrastructure in areas that represent \nimportant  nodes  for  economic  development  and  strengthening \ncommon  initiatives  to  link  South  and  Southeast  Asian  countries. \nProjects were recently started to improve transport infrastructure and \nlogistics and facilitate the flow of cross-border trade among member \ncountries.  A  BIMSTEC  trade  negotiations  committee  has  also  been \nestablished to pave the way for an eventual free trade area.\n\n140\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nEconomic  Cooperation  Organization  (ECO).  Founded  in  1985 \nby Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan as a group of non-Arab Islamic countries, \nECO was expanded in 1992 after the Soviet Union\u2019s dissolution. It now \nalso  includes  six  Central  Asian  countries\u2014Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan, \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan\u2014plus \nAfghanistan.  ECO\u2019s  highest  policy  and  decision-making  body  is  the \nCouncil of (Foreign) Ministers, which meets annually. Its organizational \nstructure  also  includes  a  Council  of  Permanent  Representatives,  a \nRegional Planning Council, and a General Secretariat consisting of six \ndirectorates under the supervision of the Secretary General and deputy \nsecretaries general. The General Secretariat (located in Tehran, Iran) \nis also mandated to supervise the nine regional institutes70 and three \nspecialized agencies71 that ECO has committed to establish. The few \nthat have been established to date are all located in the three founding \nmembers, outside Central Asia. ECO aims to establish a single market \nfor goods and services through progressive trade liberalization among \nits members. However, little progress so far has been made. Pomfret \n(2009) argues that one fundamental obstacle to economic integration \nis the pronounced similarity of ECO economies, which all specialize in \na small group of primary products.\n\nShanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). SCO was established \nin 2001 and consists of six member countries: the PRC, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  the  Russian  Federation,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan. \nIndia, Iran, Mongolia, and Pakistan are observers. Its predecessor, the \nShanghai  Five  (which  did  not  include  Uzbekistan),  was  created  in \n1996 to restructure the bilateral relationships between the PRC and the \nSoviet Union after the latter was dissolved. SCO\u2019s main functions are \nin the areas of security, energy, and economic cooperation, where the \nPRC  acts  as  a  hub  for  the  group  (Pomfret  2009).  SCO\u2019s  secretariat  is \nlocated in Beijing, PRC. Its main organs are the Heads of State Council \nMeeting, the SCO Forum, and the SCO Business Council.\n\nThe normative principles followed by the SCO Charter stress, as in \nthe case of ASEAN, mutual trust, good neighborliness, and cooperation \nas a model of regional diplomacy and security. The principles of non-\ninterference, the resolution of problems through mutual consultation, \nand non-use of force are also similar to those followed by ASEAN. In \n\n70  A trade and development bank, a reinsurance company, a shipping company, an airline, a \nchamber of commerce and industry, a consultancy and engineering company, a supreme \naudit institution, a news agency, and a college of insurance.\n\n71  A cultural institute, an education institute, and a science foundation.\n\n141\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\neffect,  the  so-called  \u201cShanghai  way\u201d  is  the  SCO\u2019s  equivalent  of  the \n\u201cASEAN way\u201d (Caballero-Anthony 2009). While the resolution of border \ndisputes  was  the  SCO\u2019s  main  focus  initially,  the  group  has  recently \nstarted  to  conduct  joint  military  exercises.  It  has  also  developed \na  robust  security  agenda  that  promotes  regional  cooperation  in \naddressing drug trafficking and organised crime.\n\nAlthough SCO is not pursuing the creation of a preferential trade \narrangement among its members, in 2004 it announced the adoption \nof some economic measures, principally financial assistance from the \nPRC  to  its  Central  Asian  neighbors  through  bank  loans  and  credits. \nMore  recently,  SCO  has  actively  promoted  energy  cooperation,  with \nthe PRC seeking to diversify its energy suppliers in response to the rise \nin the prices of oil and gas.\n\nASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO). The creation \nof  AMRO  was  officially  endorsed  by  ASEAN+3  finance  ministers \nduring their meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in May 2010. Singapore \nwas  chosen  as  the  host  country  of  this  new  institution,  which  is \nexpected  to  become  fully  operational  by  May  2011  with  an  office \nof  8\u201310  professional  staff.  AMRO\u2019s  governance  structure  and  main \nresponsibilities were decided during the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019  \nMeeting in Bali, Indonesia, in 2009.\n\nAMRO\u2019s overall mandate is to conduct macroeconomic research \nand financial surveillance for ASEAN+3 countries with the ultimate aim \nof reviewing and providing an objective assessment of the repayment \nconditions for borrowing from the multilateralized CMI. The declared \nprinciples  underlying  AMRO\u2019s  surveillance  operations  are  meant  to \nfacilitate  regulatory  cooperation,  standard  harmonization,  enhanced \ntransparency,  and  multi-level  governance  (see  Chapter  2  for  more \ndetails).\n\nCredit  Guarantee  and  Investment  Facility  (CGIF).  In  April  2010, \nADB,  together  with  the  ASEAN+3  countries,  established  the  CGIF,  a \ntrust  fund  aimed  at  promoting  financial  stability  and  boosting  long-\nterm  investment  in  the  region.  The  CGIF  totals  $700  million,  of  which \n$570 million comes from ASEAN+3 governments\u2014$200 million from the \nPRC, $200 million from Japan, $100 million from the Republic of Korea, \nand $70 million from ASEAN countries\u2014and $130 million from ADB.\n\nThe  creation  of  this  new  facility  is  expected  to  help  domestic \nfirms  tap  local  currency  and  regional  debt  markets.  The  CGIF  will \nthus help to mobilize regional savings to finance regional investment \nand  also  promote  the  harmonization  of  standards  and  practice  for \nbond  issuance,  helping  to  integrate  regional  financial  markets  (see \nChapter 2 for more details).\n\n142\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nExecutives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). \nEMEAP was established 1991 among central banks and other monetary \nauthorities  in  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  with  the  primary  objective \nof  strengthening  the  cooperative  relationship  among  its  members.  It \nhas 11 members: the Reserve Bank of Australia, the People\u2019s Bank of \nChina, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank Indonesia, the Bank \nof Japan, the Bank of Korea, Bank Negara Malaysia, the Reserve Bank \nof New Zealand, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Monetary Authority \nof Singapore, and the Bank of Thailand. EMEAP plays a significant role \nin  central  bank  coordination  and  cooperation,  working  closely  with \nregional  IRIs,  such  as  ASEAN,  ASEAN+3,  EAS,  ADB,  other  regional \ninstitutions  such  as  the  European  Central  Bank,  global  financial \ninstitutions  such  as  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  (BIS) \nand  the  Financial  Stability  Forum,  and  other  international  setters  of \nfinancial standards.\n\nEMEAP does not have a formal secretariat. Instead, the member \nhosting the next governors\u2019 meeting is responsible for arrangements. \nThe  Bank  of  Japan  acts  as  a  coordinating  agency.  Currently  EMEAP \noperates through (i) the governors\u2019 meeting, held annually on a rotating \nhost base, (ii) deputies\u2019 meetings and meetings of the monetary and \nfinancial  stability  committee,  and  (iii)  meetings  of  various  working \ngroups,  including  ones  on  financial  market  development,  central \nbanking  operations,  and  banking  supervision.  These  three  working \ngroups  define  the  main  areas  of  cooperation  promoted  by  EMEAP \n(Arner 2009).\n\nOne  of  EMEAP\u2019s  most  high-profile  activities  has  been  the \npromotion of the Asian Bond Fund (ABF) initiative, with the first stage \nlaunched in 2003, the second in 2004, and future directions currently \nunder discussion. By investing in debt securities from Asian countries, \nthe aim of ABF is to widen market demand, enable borrowing in Asia\u2019s \ndomestic currencies, and reduce, in turn, financial and exchange-rate \nrisk  by  lowering  the  dependence  on  non-Asian  financial  markets. \nWhile  the  amounts  invested  by  the  ABF  have  remained  limited,  the \ninitiative  has  promoted  dialogue  and  created  structures  for  regional \nfinancial cooperation.\n\n4.5. Pan-Asian IRIs\n\nThe two pan-Asian IRIs included in this study\u2019s stocktaking exercise, \nESCAP  and  ADB,  play  an  important  role  in  facilitating  and  driving \nregionalism  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  as  discussed  in  the  subsection \n\n143\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\non facilitating institutions in Section 4.1. They function as catalysts in \nareas where countries cannot efficiently perform their activities alone. \nThey also promote the institutionalization of regional cooperation by \nproviding knowledge products, ideas, and coordination, as well as by \ndisseminating information and conducting research on various topics.\nESCAP  and  ADB  have  also  contributed  to  the  promotion  of \ninvestment  and  trade  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  in  a  variety  of  ways, \nincluding the creation of infrastructure networks and the introduction \nof  programs  for  trade  and  investment  facilitation.  ESCAP  provides \ncourses  for  e-government  and  ICT  training.  ADB  provides  technical \nassistance  along  the  same  lines.  Both  institutions  are  well  placed \nto  perform  such  activities,  which  prepare  the  ground  for  economic \nintegration, because of their wide membership, their high-quality staff, \nand the networks they have established.\n\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe Pacific (ESCAP). Established in 1947 as the Economic Commission \nfor Asia and the Far East to assist members of the region in postwar \neconomic reconstruction, ESCAP moved its headquarters to Bangkok, \nThailand, in January 1949. It is one of the five regional commissions \ncreated under the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.72 \nThe main legislative organ of ESCAP is the commission, which meets \nannually at the ministerial level and reports to the UN Economic and \nSocial Council.\n\nESCAP\u2019s overall objective is to promote inclusive and sustainable \neconomic  and  social  development  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region, \nwith  priority  accorded  to  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Its major functions are to (i) promote economic \nand social development of its regional members through cooperation \nand  integration,  (ii)  act  as  the  primary  UN  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  forum  for  the  region,  and  (iii)  formulate  and  promote \ndevelopment assistance activities and projects to meet the needs and \npriorities  of  the  region,  acting  as  the  executing  agency  for  relevant \noperational  projects.  The  development  of  regional  infrastructure  as \nwell as trade cooperation and facilitation are the two major areas of \nESCAP\u2019s contribution to economic integration in Asia and the Pacific. \nGiven  the  wide  scope  and  range  of  operations,  ESCAP  has  also \nprompted the development of several offspring institutions that further \nfacilitate economic integration in the region (Abe 2009).\n\n72  The other four institutions are the Economic Commissions for Europe, Africa, Latin \n\nAmerica and the Caribbean, plus the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia.\n\n144\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nESCAP provided an important early contribution to Asian economic \nintegration  in  the  area  of  regional  infrastructure  development,  by \nidentifying  efficient  and  reliable  international  routes  and  networks, \nwhich  implied  either  developing  new  infrastructure  or  upgrading \nexisting  national  and  international  infrastructure.  ESCAP  started  the \nAsian Highway73 in 1959, with the aim of promoting the development \nof  international  road  transport  throughout  the  region,  and  the \nintegrated Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development (ALTID) \nin  1992,  to  further  strengthen  intra-  and  inter-regional  transport  and \ncommunication  linkages,  including  in  particular  the  Asian  Highway \nnetwork. In the area of rail transport infrastructure, in the 1960s ESCAP \ninitiated  the  Trans-Asian  Railway  (TAR)  project,  aiming  to  reduce \ntransit  times  for  goods  and  people  between  countries  and  regions \nacross Asia.\n\nIn the area of trade cooperation and facilitation, the 1975 Asia-Pacific \nTrade Agreement (APTA), previously named the Bangkok Agreement, \nis  an  ESCAP  initiative  to  create  a  preferential  tariff  arrangement  and \npromote intraregional trade through trade liberalization. With regard to \ntrade facilitation, ESCAP assists its member countries through capacity-\nbuilding programs that promote the simplification, harmonization, and \nstandardization  of  trade  procedures  in  order  to  reduce  the  cost  and \ntime of cross-border shipments.\n\nESCAP  has  also  helped  establish  several  other  institutions  for \nregional integration. The most prominent of such offspring institutions \nis  ADB,  which  took  shape  from  an  ESCAP  resolution  in  1963.  Other \ninstitutions ESCAP helped establish are the Mekong River Commission, \nthe  Asian  and  Pacific  Centre  for  Agricultural  Engineering  and \nMachinery, the  UN  Asian and  Pacific  Training  Centre  for Information \nand Communication Technology for Development, the Asia and Pacific \nCenter for Transfer of Technology, and the Statistical Institute for Asia \nand the Pacific.\n\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  As  Section  4.1  made  clear, \nfacilitating institutions play a decisive role by providing financial and \ntechnical  resources  as  well  as  institutional  support  to  functional \ninstitutions.  ADB\u2019s  role  is  particularly  important.  Established  in  1966, \nADB  is  now  mandated  to  contribute  actively  to  regional  economic \ncooperation  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  In  1994,  the  bank  adopted  a \nregional cooperation policy (RCP) which, for the first time, articulated \nADB\u2019s approach to promoting regional cooperation. Since then, ADB \n\n73  Asian Highway Handbook, ESCAP, 2003.\n\n145\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nhas supported a growing list of regional and subregional cooperation \nprograms:  GMS  in  Southeast  Asia,  SASEC  in  South  Asia,  CAREC  in \nCentral  Asia,  the  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  in  South  and \nCentral Asia (SECSCA), and the Pacific Plan.\n\nThere are three phases to ADB\u2019s support for regional cooperation. \nFirst,  ADB  is  expected  to  raise  awareness  among  its  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) on the importance of regional cooperation \nthrough  information  dissemination,  with  the  overall  aim  of  building \nmutual respect, confidence, and trust. Second, regional projects and \nprograms that could yield quick and tangible results are to be identified. \nThird,  ADB  is  to  finance  cross-border  and  national  projects  with  a \nsignificant  cross-border  or  regional  dimension.  As  well  as  regional \ncooperation  and  integration,  ADB\u2019s  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework \n(2008\u20132020) identified another four core areas of involvement for the \nADB:  infrastructure,  environment,  finance  sector  development,  and \neducation.\n\nIn 2006, ADB adopted a regional cooperation and integration (RCI) \n\nstrategy with four pillars:\n\n1.  regional and subregional economic cooperation programs on \ncross-border  infrastructure,  physical  connectivity,  and  related \nhardware/software;\n\n2.  trade  and \n\ninvestment  cooperation  and \n\nintegration,  and \n\nregulatory coordination;\n\n3.  monetary  and  financial  cooperation  and  integration,  and \n\nmacroeconomic and financial stability; and\n\n4.  cooperation  on  regional  public  goods  (clean  energy  and \nenvironmental protection, communicable disease control and \ndisaster  relief,  and  good  governance  for  transnational  crime \nprevention).\n\nThese  four  pillars  aim  to  help  reduce  poverty  in  DMCs  through \nregional  collective  action  that  leads  to  greater  physical  connectivity, \nincreased  trade  and  investment,  enhanced  financial  systems  and \nmacroeconomic and financial stability, and improved environmental, \nhealth, and social conditions.\n\nUnder the first pillar, ADB is to provide significant lending and non-\nlending operations. To implement the lending programs, ADB provides \nfinancial  assistance  and  technical  expertise  to  develop  the  required \ninfrastructure  software,  facilitate  trade  and  investment,  coordinate \nand  harmonize  sector  regulations,  procedures,  and  standards,  and \nsupport a range of cross-border policy measures.\n\nUnder  the  second  pillar,  ADB\u2019s  role  in  trade  and  investment \ncooperation  and  integration,  which  is  primarily  of  a  non-lending \n\n146\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nnature,  includes  support  to  regional  and  subregional  forums  (such \nas  ASEAN,  ASEAN+3,  SAARC,  CAREC,  GMS,  BIMSTEC,  and  BIMP-\nEAGA)  by  playing  a  facilitating  role  in  regional  trade  and  investment \npolicy dialogue; capacity and institutional development for DMCs on \nissues related to FTAs and trade facilitation; research and information \ndissemination, including support for establishing a database on FTAs \nin Asia and the Pacific; and building stronger partnerships with other \nstakeholders and institutions that support RCI in trade and investment \nin Asia and the Pacific as well as elsewhere (such as the WTO, World \nBank, Inter-American Development Bank, Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development [OECD], ESCAP, and Pacific Economic \nCooperation Council).\n\nUnder the third pillar, ADB is intensifying its support for regional \nmonetary  and  financial  cooperation  and  integration.  It  facilitates \nopen and dynamic consultation among all countries and stakeholders \nconcerned in order to ensure a broad-based consensus and a greater \nsense of ownership in implementing and managing initiatives related \nto  monetary  and  financial  cooperation  and  integration.  All  this  is \ndone through non-lending knowledge products and includes support \nfor  the  regional  economic  policy  dialogue  process,  for  both  existing \norganizations  (such  as  ASEAN,  ASEAN+3,  APEC,  and  ASEM)  and \nprospective  ones  (under  the  auspices  of  regional  forums  such  as \nSAARC and CAREC); capacity building and institutional strengthening \nof  DMCs;  analysis,  research,  and  information  dissemination;  and \npartnership  building  with  other  stakeholders  and/or  institutions  that \nsupport monetary and financial integration in Asia and the Pacific and \nelsewhere (International Monetary Fund [IMF], BIS, and the OECD).\n\nFor the fourth pillar, ADB\u2019s role focuses on supporting regional and \nsubregional policy dialogue and initiatives to protect the environment, \ncontrol  communicable  diseases  (such  as  avian  influenza,  HIV/AIDS, \nand  SARS),  manage  the  impact  of  natural  disasters,  promote  clean \nenergy and energy efficiency, improve governance, and prevent human \nand drug trafficking; conducting research on these cross-border issues; \nsupporting capacity building and institutional strengthening of DMCs to \nrespond  to  cross-border  issues;  and  supporting  regional  partnership \nbuilding through various regional forums and exchange programs.\n\nFinally,  the  RCI\u2019s  implementation  requires  adequate  resources. \nADB established the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership  Facility  (RCIFPF)  in  February  2007  to  coordinate  existing \nand new resources, and facilitate the provision of financial assistance \nfor RCI activities on a joint or parallel basis with development partners. \nResources  from  partners  under  this  facility  are  provided  through \n\n147\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nTable 4.3. Resources for RCI under the RCIFPF Framework\n\nRegional Cooperation and Integration Fund (RCIF)\n\nThe RCIF was established in 2007. It provides grants for technical assistance, including advisory, project preparatory, and regional \nhelp. As of December 2009, 58 projects had been submitted for funding with a total requested budget of $59.5 million. Thirty-seven \nprojects were selected for funding with a total commitment of $37.5 million, or 94% of the RCIF\u2019s total fund of $40 million.\n\nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund (ICFF)\n\nThe Government of Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed an arrangement in January 2008 to establish the ICFF as \na trust fund under the RCIFPF. The total commitment at end-October 2009 was $22.9 million. It aims to promote investments in \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) and facilitate regional cooperation and integration through the construction of basic infrastruc-\nture, improvements in the investment climate, capacity building, and the promotion of good governance, among other things. The ICFF \nfinances or cofinances on a grant basis: technical assistance to the public or private sector for the formulation of a legal and regula-\ntory framework, preparation of projects, and advisory services; and grant components of investment projects that contribute directly to \npoverty reduction. In 2008, seven projects were approved totaling $4.3 million. Another seven projects were approved for funding in \n2009, with a total cost of $7.2 million. The total cost of projects approved was $11.5 million, 50% of total commitments.\n\nPoverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation (PRC Fund)\n\nThe PRC Fund, the first such fund to be established by an ADB DMC, was established on 25 March 2005 by the People\u2019s Republic \nof China. It aims to strengthen the capacity of developing member countries to reduce poverty through regional cooperation. The \nPRC Fund seeks to advance ADB\u2019s regional cooperation initiatives to accelerate economic growth, spur private-sector development, \npromote peace and order, and provide regional public goods that address regional concerns such as communicable diseases and \nenvironmental degradation. The fund, totaling $20 million, was given in five equal installments from 2005\u20132009. As of January 2010, \n40 project proposals totaling $18.4 million were approved, equal to 93% of total commitments.\n\nRCIFPF = Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility.\n\nSources: ADB (2005; 2007; and www. adb.org/JRO/funds.asp).\n\npooled  grants  through  the  RCIF,  trust  funds  for  RCI,  project-specific \ngrants under framework agreements to be negotiated with financing \npartners,  knowledge  provision  and  exchange,  and  other  forms  of \nassistance. The various funds available under the RCIFPF framework \nare listed in Table 4.3.\n\n4.6. Transregional Institutions\n\nAsia\u2019s three main transregional IRIs, all of them overarching, are APEC, \nwhich  straddles  Asia  and  both  sides  of  the  Pacific,  the  Asia-Europe \nMeeting, and the narrower Eurasian Economic Community.\n\nAsia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC).  Established  in \n1989,  APEC  is  an  intergovernmental  forum  for  facilitating  economic \ngrowth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It \nproceeds on a voluntary, nonbinding, and consensus-oriented basis.74 \n\n74  The 21 member economies are Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; \nMexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; the Philippines; the Russian Federation; \nSingapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and Viet Nam. Also see Ravenhill (2002a).\n\n148\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nAPEC  has  an  ambitious  objective  of  creating  a  regional  community. \nCommunity building has been pursued through a wide range of areas \nfor  cooperation  (undertaken  by  different  committees  and  working \ngroups). APEC has an international secretariat, located in Singapore, \nwhich plays a coordinating role and provides technical and advisory \nsupport.\n\nBefore APEC\u2019s launch, economic cooperation in the wider Asia-\nPacific  region  was  promoted  through  nongovernmental  initiatives. \nThe  first  was  the  Pacific  Basin  Economic  Council  (PBEC),  a  forum \nfor  regional  business  leaders  established  in  1967  which  has  been \nin  decline  since  APEC  formed  the  APEC  Business  Advisory  Council \n(ABAC).  Another  was  the  Pacific  Trade  and  Development  (PAFTAD) \nconference series (since 1968), a forum for policy-oriented academics \nin  the  region.  PECC  (initially  the  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \nConference,  later  the  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Council),  a \ntripartite consultative body of people from business, government, and \nacademic  circles  in  the  region,  was  formed  in  1980.  All  established \ninternational secretariats, and both PBEC and PECC formed national \nchapters  that  helped  create  constituencies  for  regional  economic \ncooperation.  All  three  have  played  and  continue  to  play  overlapping \nsupporting and facilitating roles.\n\nSince  its  first  Economic  Leaders\u2019  Meeting  in  Seattle,  United \nStates (US), in 1993, APEC\u2019s main task has been trade and investment \nliberalization  and  facilitation.  In  Seattle,  APEC  leaders  declared  that \nthey  would  achieve  \u201cfree  and  open  trade  and  investment  in  Asia \nand Pacific.\u201d A year later, in Bogor, Indonesia, they set a deadline for \nachieving that goal of 2010 for APEC\u2019s developed economies and 2020 \nfor developing ones (Bogor Goals). In 1995, leaders adopted the Osaka \nAction Agenda, a strategic roadmap for implementing the Bogor Goals. \nIn  Manila,  Philippines,  in  1996,  leaders  agreed  that  each  member \neconomy should henceforth submit an annual Individual Action Plan \n(IAP) detailing their actions to meet the Bogor Goals.\n\nThe 1997/98 financial crisis and its economic and political fallout \ndealt  APEC  a  huge  blow.  Early  voluntary  sectoral  liberalization, \nan  attempt  to  open  up  ostensibly  \u201ceasy\u201d  sectors,  also  failed.  IAPs \nimplemented since 1997 have achieved much less liberalization than \nexpected.  Although  APEC  economies  have  liberalized  multilaterally \nby implementing on schedule their commitments under the Uruguay \nRound of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), further \nunilateral  liberalization  has  been  limited  in  coverage  and  depth.  \nWith  progress  on  liberalization  slow,  APEC  has  shifted  its  attention \ntowards  issues  such  as  trade  facilitation,  capacity  building,  and  \n\n149\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nregulatory \n\nbehind-the-border \nreforms.  This  agenda  shift  also \nreflects  changes  in  the  business  environment,  notably  the  increased \nglobalization  of  trade  and  investment  and  the  proliferation  of \npreferential trade agreements in Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. The 2005 \nBusan Roadmap for achieving the Bogor Goals also reflected this shift \n(Yamazawa 2009).\n\nAPEC  responded  in  a  timely  manner  to  the  recent  global \neconomic and financial crisis. On 15 November 2008 in Washington, \nUnited States, leaders of the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and \nCentral Bank Governors (G20) agreed to take urgent action to stabilize \nfinancial  markets  and  to  coordinate  their  macroeconomic  policies \nto restore growth and stability\u2014steps the 2008 APEC forum in Lima, \nPeru,  strongly  supported.  The  G20  looks  likely  to  be  an  increasingly \nimportant  forum  for  managing  the  world  economy.  Since  nine  of  its \nmembers are also in APEC, they could help shape the G20 agenda if \nthey  coordinated  their  positions.  APEC  could  also  cooperate  closely \nwith  the  G20  in  tackling  other  challenges  such  as  environmental \nprotection,  disaster  management,  and  preventing  the  spread  of \ninfectious diseases prevention. However, APEC\u2019s agenda is overloaded \nand over the next decade leaders need to set it new priorities both in \nits  traditional  arena  of  trade  and  investment  liberalization  and  more \nbroadly. With the US due to host APEC leaders in 2011\u2014and the US \npresident\u2019s evident support\u2014APEC can succeed in doing so.\n\nThe year 2010 is the deadline for meeting its mid-term Bogor Goals. \nAPEC\u2019s developed economies still maintain trade barriers in sensitive \nsectors but have made fairly good progress on trade and investment \nfacilitation (Yamazawa 2009). Its \u201cfive plus \u03b1\u201d economies are likely to \ngraduate from their Bogor Goals process and set a post-Bogor agenda \nto  pursue  deeper  liberalization  through  a  Trans-Pacific  Partnership \n(TPP) or FTA for Asia Pacific (FTAAP).75 APEC has already adopted a \n\u201cpathfinder\u201d approach whereby economies that are ready to do so can \nproceed faster than others. Some other economies, including ASEAN \nmembers once they have completed their AEC agenda, are expected \nto join this \u201cfive plus \u03b1\u201d group. If APEC moves towards a post-Bogor \nagenda of further liberalization and tackling new cooperation issues, it \nwill help ASEAN+3 and EAS move forward too. While it is still unclear \nhow  ASEAN+3  and  the  EAS  will  manage  their  relationships  with \npartners outside their region, APEC can certainly help with countries \nacross  the  Pacific,  notably  the  US.  The  US  could  also  use  APEC  to \n\n75  The \u201cfive\u201d are the developed economies of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the \nUS, while the \u03b1 denotes other economies such as Chile; Hong Kong, China; and Singapore \nthat are equally qualified.\n\n150\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nensure that American businesses are fairly treated by ASEAN+3 and \nthe EAS without actually joining those organizations.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that despite APEC\u2019s continued adherence \nto a voluntary, nonbinding system, it has embarked on a limited form \nof accountability: a peer review of the annual submission of members\u2019 \nIAPs.  Arguably,  this  process  has  created  a  system  of  peer  pressure  to \nnudge member countries toward taking the progressive steps necessary \nfor accelerating growth. To be sure, sovereignty concerns remain, and \nthe general preference for managing sensitive issues between member \nstates at the global rather than regional level still holds.\n\nAsia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM).  Inspired  by  APEC,  East  Asian \ncountries  have  also  developed  overarching  institutions  that  connect \nthem  to  Europe  and  Latin  America.76  The  ASEM  began  in  1996  in \nBangkok. The idea for an ASEM has been attributed to Goh Chok Tong, \nthe former prime minister of Singapore, who had raised it during a visit \nto Europe in 1994. It won support from Germany and the EU, which \nled to the publication of Towards a New Asia Strategy that envisioned \nstrengthening  \u201cthe  Union\u2019s  economic  presence  in  Asia  in  order  to \nmaintain the Union\u2019s leading role in the world economy.\u201d77\n\nAn  intergovernmental  overarching  institution,  the  ASEM  process \ncomprises  participants  from  East  Asia  and  the  EU.78  The  Chairman\u2019s \nStatement from the first summit called for \u201ca new comprehensive Asia-\nEurope Partnership for Greater Growth\u201d, one that would \u201cstrengthen \ndialogue  on  an  equal  basis\u2026  through  the  sharing  of  perceptions  on \na  wide  range  of  issues.\u201d79  ASEM  summits  are  held  every  two  years, \nalternately  in  Asia  and  Europe.  Heads  of  state  and/or  government \nattend,  as  do  accompanying  ministers,  the  head  of  the  European \nCommission  and  other  stakeholders.  Complementing  the  ASEM \nsummits  are  a  series  of  ministerial  and  working-level  meetings,  as \nwell as a number of activities arising from them. ASEM activities are \ngrouped into three pillars: political, economic, and sociocultural.\n\nASEM  leaders  have  identified  the  following  as  areas  of  shared \nconcern and prospective collaboration: strengthening multilateralism \n\n76  The transregional institution linking East Asia and Latin America, the Forum for East Asia\u2013\n\nLatin America Cooperation (FEALAC), will not be discussed here. Both informal processes \nare similar in that they share a so-called \u201csoft rules framework\u201d (Yeo 2000; Milliot 2004).\n\n77  European Commission (1994: 3).\n78  They are: Austria, Belgium, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, \nHungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mongolia, Myanmar, \nthe Netherlands, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, \nSlovenia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Kingdom, Viet Nam, the ASEAN Secretariat, and \nthe European Commission.\n\n79  ASEM (1996: 1).\n\n151\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nand  addressing  global  threats  of  common  concern;  globalization, \ncompetitiveness,  and  structural  changes  in  the  global  economy; \nsustainable  development  with  a  focus  on  the  UN\u2019s  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals;  climate  change,  the  environment,  and  energy; \nand  intercultural  and  interfaith  dialogue.  After  the  1997/98  Asian \nfinancial  crisis,  an  ASEM  Trust  Fund  was  established  to  finance  \nsmall-scale  projects  for  a  limited  period.  Asia-Europe  cooperation \nhas not progressed very far, however, partly because the broad (and \nvague)  areas  enumerated  above  are  accompanied  by  few  (if  any) \nspecifics  (Robles  2007).  Even  the  ASEM  Trust  Fund  is  administered \nby  an  external  institution,  the  IMF.  Moreover,  the  ASEM  process  has \nindirectly  been  complicated  by  institutional  enlargement  in  both \nASEAN and the EU.\n\nAlthough ASEM\u2019s formation helped to bridge the perceived cultural \nand  political  differences  between  East  Asia  and  Europe,  the  issue \nof  Myanmar  has  been  a  sore  point.  The  divide  between  developed \nand  developing  East  Asia  has  also  complicated  cooperative  efforts, \nas has the EU\u2019s reluctance to engage in dialogue over reform of the \ninternational  financial  architecture.  The  EU\u2019s  decision  to  embark  on \nFTA negotiations with ASEAN in October 2006 was an acknowledgment \nthat the ASEM process had failed to deliver on its aims. Indeed, ASEM \nhas  achieved  considerably  less  than  APEC  in  terms  of  transregional \ntrade. From the Europeans\u2019 viewpoint, by negotiating for an FTA, they \nwere merely playing \u201ccatch-up\u201d in the wake of a spate of bilateral FTAs \nconcluded  between  individual  ASEAN  members  and  Japan  or  the \nUS.80 However, through two nonbinding ASEM frameworks, the Trade \nFacilitation Action Plan (TFAP) and the Investment Promotion Action \nPlan (IPAP), the EU has been able to urge transregional dialogue on \ntrade facilitation and investment promotion, through which their Asian \ncounterparts have been pressured to revise domestic laws and grant \nmarket access to European firms (Robles 2007).\n\nEurasian Economic Community (EurAsEc). EurAsEc\u2014which was \nestablished in 2000 and includes the Russian Federation and Belarus, \nplus  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan  in  Central  Asia, \nwhile Uzbekistan has suspended its membership since late 2008\u2014aims \nto  capitalize  on  continuing  economic  links  among  the  former  Soviet \nrepublics.  It  originates  from  an  initiative  in  1994  to  form  a  customs \nunion  between  the  Russian  Federation,  Belarus,  and  Kazakhstan, \nwhich  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  subsequently  joined.  The \nCentral  Asian  Economic  Community  (CAEC)  formed  by  Kazakhstan, \n\n152\n\n80  On European motivations, see Geest (2004).\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan  in  1994,  later  renamed  Central \nAsia  Cooperation  Organization  (CACO),  was  in  effect  subsumed  by \nEurAsEc  in  2005.  EurAsEc  has  arguably  been  driven  largely  by  the \nRussian Federation\u2019s desire, and that of some Central Asian countries, \nto keep other major powers out of that region. Its members also share \nproblems that provide a strong basis for regional cooperation in areas \nsuch as trade, water, energy, and perhaps security (Pomfret 2009).\n\nEurAsEc  has  an  Interstate  Council  consisting  of  heads  of  state  \nand/or  government  that  meets  regularly.  It  also  has  an  Inter-\nparliamentary Assembly, with a secretariat in St. Petersburg, Russian \nFederation,  and  a  Court  of  Justice  in  Minsk,  Belarus,  an  institutional \nfeature absent in other Asian subregions. EurAsEc also has a number \nof  working  groups.  In  2006,  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan \nestablished  the  Eurasian  Development  Bank,  which  is  formally \nindependent but works closely with EurAsEc and became an official \nobserver  in  2008.  In  2009,  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan \ncreated a $10 billion fund to address the widening income gaps within \nEurAsEc. However, fundamental (political, geopolitical, and economic) \nproblems have prevented this regional institution from making much \nprogress in promoting regional economic integration (Pomfret 2009).\n\n4.7. Security Institutions\n\nSince  the  end  of  the  Cold  War,  security-related  institutions  in  Asia \nand the Pacific have grown. In a sense, most (if not all) overarching \ninstitutions in the region are security-oriented in that security concerns \nend up on their agendas at some time for a variety of reasons. APEC \nis  a  good  example:  in  the  wake  of  the  9/11  terror  attacks,  terrorism \nbecame the focus of the 2001 forum in Shanghai, PRC, notwithstanding \nits trade agenda. For our purposes, the security institutions of interest \nhere are two transregional IRIs\u2014the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and \nthe Six-Party Talks (SPT)\u2014and a regional one: the Collective Security \nTreaty Organization (CSTO).\n\nASEAN  Regional  Forum  (ARF).  Comprising  27  members,81  the \nARF  has  two  stated  objectives:  fostering  constructive  dialogue  and \nconsultation on political and security issues of common interest and \nconcern;  and  contributing  to  security  cooperation  in  Asia  and  the \n\n81  ASEAN-10, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the EU, India, \nJapan, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, \nNew Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Timor-\nLeste, and the United States. \n\n153\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nPacific.  More  fundamentally,  the  ARF  is  a  mechanism  for  ASEAN  to \nkeep the US engaged in the region, while peacefully engaging a rising \nPRC, encouraging it to become a \u201cresponsible\u201d power, and maintaining \nthe centrality of ASEAN in the regional security architecture. Its origins \nlie in the ASEAN Post-ministerial Conferences (PMCs), which helped \ntransform ASEAN\u2019s relations with its dialogue partners into an informal \nmultilateral  arrangement.82  With  the  institutionalization  of  the  PMC \nprocess  into  the  ARF  in  1994,  Asia  and  the  Pacific  finally  obtained  a \nsecurity  institution  that  serves  the  entire  region.  In  1995,  the  ARF \nreleased its Concept Paper, which identified a three-stage approach to \nsecurity cooperation: confidence building, preventive diplomacy, and \nconflict resolution.\n\nSeen  as  little  more  than  a  talking  shop,  ARF  has  long  remained \nin  confidence-building  mode,  unable  to  pursue  its  more  ambitious \ngoals.83  It  is  hampered  by  political  and  institutional  constraints,  not \nleast the size of its membership, the participation of the world\u2019s major \npowers,  and  the  structural  oddity  of  having  ASEAN,  a  subregional \ngrouping  of  relatively  weak  states,  acting  as  its  fulcrum.  Of  late,  the \nARF  has  opted  to  reformulate  its  strategy  towards  practical  regional \ncooperation  through  concrete  programs  in  areas  such  as  disaster-\nrelief management, maritime security, and counterterrorism (Severino \n2010). However, the ARF has achieved little so far, perhaps because \nof  resource  constraints.  Rather,  collaboration  is  between  some \nASEAN and some non-ASEAN members of the ARF, with a fair bit of \nactivity centered on capacity building (Haacke 2009). A former ASEAN \nsecretary-general has argued for the formation of a body to execute \nARF's  decisions  on  dealing  with  non-traditional  security  threats \n(Severino 2010).\n\nSix  Party  Talks  (SPT).  Established  in  2003,  the  Six-Party  Talks \n(SPT)\u2014which  bring  together  the  PRC,  Japan,  the  Democratic \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  Korea,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  Russian \nFederation,  and  the  US\u2014is  an  ad  hoc  framework  for  negotiations \non the proposed denuclearization of the DPRK. Launched in August \n2003 in a bid to end the DPRK\u2019s nuclear program through multilateral \nnegotiations  among  its  six  members,  the  SPT  has  two  key  roles. \nFirst,  it  addresses  region-specific  proliferation  dynamics.  Second,  it \nseeks  to  enhance  global  governance  by  supporting  the  global  non-\n\n82  The role of non-state institutions in promoting security cooperation\u2014in particular, \n\nnongovernmental, Track 2 policy communities comprising representatives from academia, \nthink tanks, media, and the corporate sector (ASEAN-ISIS, CSCAP)\u2014should also be \nacknowledged.\n\n83  Emmers and Tan (2009); Katsumata (2006); Yuzawa (2006).\n\n154\n\n\fAnatomy of Institutions for Regional Integration \n\nproliferation  regime  through  compliance  with  the  norms  and  rules \nof  the  Nuclear  Non-Proliferation  Treaty  (NPT)  and  the  International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nSome  view  the  SPT  as  a  potential  building  block  for  a  future \nsecurity institution for Northeast Asia (Smith 2010). In effect, the talks \nhave  become  a  multilateral  mechanism  for  dealing  with  the  DPRK, \nshort  of  using  force.  The  SPT  also  involves  five  significant  regional \npowers actively engaging in preventive diplomatic activities, implicitly \nchallenging the ARF as a security institution of significance. It has also \nled  the  US,  the  PRC,  and  Japan  to  negotiate  and  revise  their  policy \npositions in ways the ARF has not been able to accomplish. At present, \nsecretariat functions for the SPT are undertaken by the PRC\u2019s Ministry \nof Foreign Affairs.\n\nCollective  Security  Treaty  Organization  (CSTO).  In  May  2002, \nthe Collective Security Treaty of the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates  was  renamed  the  Collective  Security  Treaty  Organization \n(CSTO),  with  the  stated  intent  of  preserving  territorial  integrity  and \nseeking  closer  cooperation  with  multilateral  institutions  such  as  the \nUN,  the  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  (OSCE),  SCO, \nand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The CSTO brings \ntogether  the  Russian  Federation,  Armenia,  Belarus,  Kazakhstan,  the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan  (which  joined  in  2006). \nA  common  air-defense  architecture  and  the  coordination  of  foreign, \nsecurity,  and  defense  policies  are  also  part  of  the  CSTO  framework. \nCounterterrorism  has  also  been  a  priority.  The  Russian  Federation \nhas, through the CSTO, committed financial and technical resources \nand  also  supported  the  OSCE\u2019s  initiative  to  develop  projects  aimed \nat  strengthening  security  along  Tajikistan\u2019s  border  with  Afghanistan. \nMuch as in the case of the EurAsEc, the Russian Federation more or \nless defines the organization\u2019s agenda. Due to a lack of political will \nand resource constraints, most CSTO members have not contributed \nin a substantive way to the organization.\n\n4.8. Conclusion\n\nAsia  and  the  Pacific  is  so  vast  that  it  defies  easy  generalization.  Its \ncomplex regional architecture\u2014a tangled web of IRIs with overlapping \nagendas  and  memberships\u2014reflects  its  diverse  geography,  history, \nideology, culture, and politics, as well as the influence of events and the \nexternal players. Tensions between functionally determined (interest \nand/or issue-based) arrangements and the quest for culturally defined \n\n155\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n(values-based) configurations have added to the complexity (Yu 2003). \nBroadly  speaking,  though,  the  region\u2019s  institutions  are  characterized \nby an intergovernmental structure, consensus decision-making, non-\nbinding  rules  and  commitments,  low  delegation,  weak  compliance, \nand robust sovereignty norms.\n\nThe evolution of Asia\u2019s IRIs has been mainly ad hoc and reactive, \nwith  most  having  emerged  in  response  to  specific  objectives  and \npressing needs.84 Institutional forms and designs have evolved along \nwith  changing  patterns  of  sociocultural,  economic,  and  political \nrelationships  and  links.  The  ARF  and  ASEAN+3,  for  instance,  have \nemerged  from  the  growing  ties  between  ASEAN  and  its  external \ndialogue  partners.  The  ASEAN  Charter  emerged  from  the  collective \nwillingness  of  ASEAN  member  states  to  \u201cupgrade\u201d  their  regional \nassociation in response to emerging economic and political challenges \n(Severino  2009).  While  Asia\u2019s  IRIs  ought  to  be  strengthened  and  the \nregional  institutional  architecture  streamlined,  ad  hoc  arrangements \nhave not all been ineffectual. Cementing existing achievements is thus \na crucial task.\n\nThe  region\u2019s  economic,  political,  and  security  architecture  is \nevolving, and regional leaders and policymakers have talked about\u2014\nand  developed  plans  for\u2014enhancing  regional  cooperation.  Efforts \nsuch  as  the  Pacific  Islands\u2019  Regional  Institutional  Framework  imply \na growing determination to limit agenda and/or role duplication and \nwaste of resources. Regional leaders may need to identify which IRIs \nare the \u201cdefining\u201d institutions that can best meet the specific demands \nof a particular challenge. EAS leaders\u2019 affirmation at their 2009 summit \non  ASEAN+3\u2019s  role  as  the  \u201cmain  vehicle\u201d  for  East  Asia  community \nbuilding suggests that regional leaders may be making that effort.\n\n84  All the chapters emphasize this point; for detailed analysis, see Chand (2009) and Severino \n\n(2009).\n\n156\n\n\fn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\np\no\no\nC\n \nf\no\n \ns\na\ne\nr\nA\n

\nRegional Comparisons\n\nYet  such \n\ninstitutional  models \n\nDespite  Asia\u2019s  robust  economic \n\nintegration  and  the \nproliferation of regional institutions and agreements over \nthe  past  decade,  misplaced  comparisons  with  other \nregions  have  cast  a  shadow  over  institution  building  in \nAsia. Europe, in particular, is often held up as a model to \nfollow (by those who lament Asian institutions\u2019 limitations in creating \nand enforcing binding obligations), or to avoid (by those who view the \ninformality and consensus building of Asian institutions as superior to \nthe rule-driven and formal apparatus of European integration).\ninterregional  sparring  over \n\nis \nexaggerated.  For  one  thing,  Asia  is  changing:  the  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  has  endorsed  a  more  formal  legal \nidentity for its core institutions; and the former prime minister of Japan, \nYukio  Hatoyama,  proposed  an  East  Asian  Community  that  explicitly \nreferences  the  European  example  of  national  reconciliation  and \ncooperation. Also, Europe is not as different from Asia as it once seemed: \nit has become clear that European governments and electorates remain \ndeeply attached to national sovereignty and institutional accountability.\nTaking  a  longer  view  and  a  broader  sample  of  regions,  Asia  no \nlonger  appears  an  outlier  on  all  dimensions  of  regional  institution \nbuilding.  As  Chapter  4  showed,  it  is  hardly  bereft  of  regional \ninstitutions\u2014and when compared to other developing regions, Asia\u2019s \ninstitutions may differ more in their design than in their effectiveness. \nMoreover, a systematic, worldwide review of institutions for regional \nintegration  (IRIs)  reveals  no  single  model  of  regional  development \nthat Asia must emulate. Comparisons with other regions are therefore \nbest used to explain Asia\u2019s institutional trajectory to date and evaluate \n\n162\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nfeasible  future  options,  rather  than  to  assert  an  optimal  model  of \nregional development.\n\nIn  this  chapter,  comparisons  are  organized  by  the  clusters  of \nvariables,  described  in  Chapter  3,  that  have  influenced  the  dynamics \nand design of regional institutions in Asia and elsewhere: the underlying \ncharacteristics  that  may  affect  regional  preferences  for  cooperation \n(Section  5.1);  the  dynamics  of  institution  building  (Section  5.2); \ninstitutional design and its effects (Section 5.3); and, finally, explanations \nfor  institutional  effectiveness  (Section  5.4).  The  chapter  concludes \nby  using  the  findings  from  comparative  analysis  to  present  plausible \ninstitutional futures for Asian regionalism (Section 5.5).\n\n5.1. Regional Characteristics\n\nThree main characteristics of a region shape its institution building: the \ndegree of homogeneity of national policy preferences; the distribution \nof  economic  and  military  power;  and  its  openness,  notably  to  the \ninfluence of external actors. Asia (and other regions) must take these \ninto account in seeking to design effective institutions.\n\nPreferences for Economic Cooperation\nThe  degree  of  homogeneity  of  national  preferences  for  regional \ncooperation and institution building tends to depend on three further \ncharacteristics: the extent of regional economic integration, the degree \nof disparities in income levels, and the similarity of political regimes.\n\nAs  documented  in  Chapter  2,  Asia\u2019s  economies  are  almost  as \nintegrated  as  Europe\u2019s  and  North  America\u2019s.  In  other  regions,  such \nincreasing  integration  has  led  both  governments  and  private  actors, \nparticularly  businesses,  to  demand  regional  action  to  consolidate \nand  deepen  integration.  Yet,  compared  to  other  regions,  firms  and \nother social actors in Asia have been relatively passive; governments \nhave  been  the  main  drivers  of  regional  institution  building.  Regional \nfirms  have  seldom  lobbied  actively  for\u2014or  even  made  use  of\u2014the \npreferential  trade  agreements  that  have  proliferated  over  the  past \ndecade  (Ravenhill  2009).  Entities  that  represent  business  within \nregional  institutions\u2014such  as  the  ASEAN  Business  Advisory  Council, \nthe  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  Business  Advisory \nCouncil,  and  the  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Council\u2014behave  as \nformal consultative bodies rather than advocacy groups championing \nbusiness interests.\n\n163\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nNesadurai\u2019s (2009) investigation of labor organizations and other \ncivil society groups reveals a similar pattern: they are not decisive (or \neven  prominent)  players  in  the  development  of  regional  economic \ninstitutions  in  Asia.  Groups  affiliated  with  regional  organizations\u2014\nsuch  as  the  ASEAN  Trade  Union  Council,  the  ASEAN  People\u2019s \nAssembly, and the Solidarity for Asian People\u2019s Advocacy\u2014have been \nmore active, but have scarcely been a driving force for regional and \nsubregional institutions. In contrast to several other regions, regional \ninstitution  building  in  Asia  has  so  far  been  a  top\u2013down  process  led \nby  governments.  Behind  them,  by  and  large,  have  been  domestic \npolitical  and  economic  coalitions  that  support  integration  into  the \ninternational  economy  and  efforts  to  enhance  regional  cooperation \n(Solingen 2009).\n\nWhile Asia\u2019s economic integration may suggest a convergence of \nnational  preferences  for  regional  cooperation,  other  measures  point \ntoward a greater heterogeneity. Asia displays a wider divide between \nits richest and poorest members than Europe or the Americas. Asia\u2019s \npolitical systems are also more diverse than those of most other regions, \nwhich tend to be either predominantly democratic (the Americas and \nEurope)  or  authoritarian  (the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa).  Public \nspending levels also vary more across Asia than Europe (if not other \nregions),  reflecting  a  split  between  countries  with  social-democratic \npreferences for a larger state sector and more market-oriented ones \nwith smaller governments (Hix 2009).\n\nOther measures of preference convergence produce a more mixed \npicture.  Survey  data  suggest  that  individual  Asian  citizens\u2019  values\u2014\nparticularly attitudes toward wealth accumulation and protecting the \nenvironment\u2014vary  roughly  as  much  as  across  the  27  members  of \nthe European Union (EU) (Hix 2009). Surprisingly, identification with \nthe region was also similarly strong. Despite this evidence of popular \npreferences, \u201coverall, the level of political, economic and ideological \nconvergence is lower in East Asia than in Europe\u201d (Hix 2009). All this \nevidence that preferences across Asia vary more points to the value of \nsubregional institutions or functional ones within the region that would \ngroup economies with similar preferences.\n\nDistribution of Economic and Military Power\nThe  skewed  distribution  of  the  size  of  Asia\u2019s  populations  and \neconomies,  a  reasonable  first  approximation  of  national  power,  is \nunlike  that  of  Europe  and  other  regions.  As  described  in  Chapter  3, \n\n164\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nhowever, the effects of power distribution on the building of regional \ninstitutions are contested. Regions with relatively lower (Europe) and \nhigher (North America) degrees of military and economic asymmetry \nhave  constructed  successful  institutions  for  integration  (albeit  much \nmore  developed  in  Europe\u2019s  case  than  in  North  America).  Both  the \ndynamic  of  power  relations  (the  speed  of  shifts  in  economic  and \nmilitary  power)  and  the  persistence  of  regional  rivalries  among \ndominant powers may be more significant than a simple measure of \npower distribution.\n\nStrategic  competition  has  certainly  shaped  the  evolution  of \nregional institutions in Asia. Ravenhill (2009) finds that the recent surge \nin preferential trading arrangements involving Asian economies\u2014like \nthe  wider  and  longer-running  effort  to  build  subregional  and  pan-\nregional  economic  cooperation  frameworks\u2014has  been  \u201cdriven  by \npolitics  rather  than  economics.\u201d  Notably,  \u201cIn  East  Asia,  the  political \ndomino  effect  has  been  shaped  by  rivalry  between  PRC  and  Japan \nfor  regional \nlike  the \neconomically driven version described by Baldwin (2009), may have \nliberalizing  consequences.  But  contested  leadership  and  rivalry  may \nalso  set  limits  on  both  liberalization  and  regional  cooperation,  since \ndeeper  economic  integration  may  require  sturdier  institutions  with \ngreater delegated authority, a development which requires a degree of \nconsensus among the major participating powers.\n\nleadership.\u201d  This  political  domino  effect, \n\nOpen Regionalism and the Influence of  \nOutside Actors\nHistory illustrates the effects\u2014both positive and negative\u2014that outside \nintervention  may  have  on  regional  collaboration  and  institutional \noutcomes.  Perhaps  the  most  significant  example  is  the  support  lent \nby the United States (US) to the building of the European Economic \nCommunity (EEC) during the Cold War. Especially in the decade after \n1945,  when  Europe  was  dependent  on  the  US  economically  as  well \nas for its security, the US clearly endorsed common European policies \nand new regional institutions. For political and military reasons, the US \npreferred an integrated Europe with coherent policies.\n\nWhile  outside  powers  generally  no  longer  exert  as  much  as \ninfluence as the Cold War superpowers  did, some regions are more \nsusceptible  to  external  influence  than  others.  In  Africa,  external \nagencies  and  governments  have  provided  key  support  for  nascent \nregional  institutions,  but  have  also  pressed  agendas  that  were  not \n\n165\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nshared by regional governments and sponsored competing subregional \norganizations.85  In  Latin  America,  the  US  has  promoted  democracy \nerratically, but has had relatively little influence on regional economic \ninstitutions.\n\nAsia remains dependent on the US and the EU for export markets, \nalthough that dependence is likely to decline over time. Four Asian states \nalso have military alliances with the US; several others have informal \ndefense relationships with it. Outside parties will therefore have a deep \ninterest  in  the  choices  made  in  building  regional  institutions\u2014and \nsubstantial leverage to influence them. Of course, misplaced efforts to \nuse that leverage could also spur defensive regionalism in Asia.\n\nComparative  evidence  indicates  that  these  underlying  regional \ncharacteristics\u2014preference  heterogeneity,  power  asymmetries,  and \nopenness  to  outside  influence\u2014may  not  produce  uniformly  strong  or \npredictable effects on regional collaboration. Their influence is unlikely to \ndiminish in the near term, however. In order to be effective, then, regional \ninstitutions  must  be  designed  to  offset  any  negative  effects.  Smaller \nregional groupings can combine countries with convergent preferences \n(at  least  at  the  outset);  diplomatic  efforts  can  be  made  to  dampen \nregional  rivalries;  and  transparency  in  negotiating  and  implementing \nregional  agreements  may  alleviate  the  concerns  of  outside  powers \ncapable of undermining regional projects. Box 5.1 looks in greater depth \nat differences between Europe in the 1950s and Asia now, and how these \nhave shaped regional integration and institution building.\n\n5.2. Dynamics of Institution Building\n\nEach  major  region  has  experienced  a  different  dynamic  of  regional \ndevelopment.  The  evolving  links  between  security  conditions  and \neconomic integration have affected the success of regional institutions. \nFeedback  effects  from  economic  integration  have  strengthened  the \ndemand for regional institutions in some cases and led to alternative \ninstitutional responses in others. The importance of the regional option \nitself, compared to global and subregional institutions, has varied over \ntime  both  within  and  between  regions.  Contingencies,  including  the \nemergence of regional political entrepreneurs and exogenous shocks \nfrom  military  threats  and  economic  crises,  have  had  demonstrable \n(but unpredictable) effects on the building of regional institutions.\n\n85  See Khadiagala (2009) on the role of outside actors in the Economic Community of Central \nAfrican States and competition between the West African Economic and Monetary Union, \nsponsored by France, and the Economic Community of West African States, led by Nigeria.\n\n166\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nBox 5.1. Differences between Europe in the 1950s and Asia Today\n\nThe world was a very different place in 1950. \n\nBoth  the  economic  and  the  geopolitical \nin  assessing \ndifferences  are  crucial \nthe \ntook \n\nintegration \n\nwhy  European  regional \nsupranational form that it did.\n\nto \n\nIn  1950,  the  world  was  emerging  from  four \nappalling decades which had seen two world wars \nand  the  Great  Depression.  All  three  catastrophes \nled  to  widespread  restrictions  on  trade,  which \nbecame locked in (Findlay and O\u2019Rourke 2007). As \na  result,  the  postwar  world  economy  was  highly \nfragmented  and  characterized  by  unconvertible \ncurrencies,  high  tariffs,  and  widespread  quotas. \nWhile  23  states  signed  the  General  Agreement \non  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT)  in  1947,  with  the \npurpose of encouraging \u201creciprocal and mutually \nadvantageous  arrangements  directed \nthe \nsubstantial  reduction  of  tariffs  and  other  barriers \nto  trade,\u201d  by  the  1950s  the  GATT  process  had \nstalled, in part as a result of the free-rider problems \nassociated  with  the  most-favored-nation  clause \n(Irwin  1995).  The  \u201cdollar  shortage\u201d  problem  also \nmeant  that  moves  to  make  European  currencies \nconvertible \nregional  approach, \nembodied  in  the  European  Payments  Union. \nRegional  trade  agreements  were  therefore  a \ndesirable  option  for  export-oriented  economies, \nsuch  as  the  Netherlands,  which  wanted  to  see \ntrade  (notably  in  agriculture)  liberalized  more \nrapidly than could be achieved at the global level \n(where  it  was  not  on  the  agenda).  In  1952,  the \nNetherlands proposed that the European Defence \nand Political Communities then under discussion \nshould form a customs union.\n\nrequired  a \n\nThe  proposal \n\nin  other \ncountries,  since  postwar  European  economic \ngrowth  was  based  on  high  investment,  which \n\nfound  an  echo \n\nrequired  export  markets  to  be  sustainable.  But \nthe  proposed  common  market  could  not  be \nbased  on  trade  in  industrial  products  alone, \nsince agriculture was very important to countries \nsuch  as  the  Netherlands  and  France.  Including \nagriculture,  however,  meant  replicating  at  the \nEuropean  level  the  extensive  intervention  in  the \nsector  which  all  European  governments  were \nthen  pursuing.  Forming  a  customs  union  also \nimplied for governments in France and elsewhere \na need to ensure a level playing field by developing \nEuropean  social  policies,  since  any  \u201crace  to  the \nbottom\u201d  from  intra-European  competition  would \nhave been incompatible with the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d \nbetween capital and labor which then underpinned \nEuropean growth strategies. German industrialists \nmight  have  preferred  a  wider  industrial  free \ntrade area, which did not involve costly common \nEuropean agricultural or social policies. However, \nthe European Economic Community (EEC) was a \nplausible  second-best  solution,  given  the  lack  of \na global alternative. (Even more important in the \nGerman  context,  however,  was  the  opportunity \nafforded by the EEC for re-establishing the Federal \nRepublic of Germany as a normal country.)\n\nIn contrast, the world economy today is highly \nglobalized. Since Asian export sectors already have \naccess  to  global  markets,  they  do  not  have  the \nsame  interest  in  regional  trade  agreements.  As  in \npostwar Europe, Asian growth strategies have been \nbased  on  exports,  but  Asian  tigers  have  always \nbeen  able  to  export  to  Western  markets,  which \nhave been relatively open. They have not needed \nto  carve  out  a  large  regional  market  via  regional \nintegration to promote export-oriented investment. \nIn  addition,  countries  such  as \nthe  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  do  not  have  European-style  \n\ncontinued on next page\n\n167\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBox 5.1 continued\n\nwelfare states, and the question of how to reconcile \nthese welfare states with increasing trade is hardly \ngoing  to  prompt  a  search  for  pan-Asian  social \npolicies.  Nor  will  it  be  necessary,  one  supposes, \nto  develop  an  Asian  common  agricultural  policy \nin order to deepen regional trade integration. This \nhas already occurred more or less spontaneously \nin  the  industrial  sphere,  with  the  development  of \n\u201cFactory  Asia\u201d  exporting  into  a  largely  liberalized \nglobal economy.\n\nIt  is  perhaps  not  surprising,  then,  that  finance \nrather  than  trade  has  been  the  focus  of  Asian \nregional  initiatives  in  recent  years.  Projects  such \nas  the  Chiang  Mai  Initiative  (CMI)  may  prove  very \nbeneficial.  But  even  if  it  evolves  into  an  Asian \nMonetary Fund, it will not require the supranational \npolitical  institutions  of  the  EU,  any  more  than \nthe \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  does.  Trade \nliberalization  required  such  institutions  in  Europe \nbecause  it  was  based  on  interrelated  bargains \non  sensitive  subjects  such  as  agricultural  policy, \nwhich  would  have  broken  down  without  these \ninstitutions. Even more fundamentally, issues such \nas agricultural, social, or regional policy could not be \ndelegated  to  independent  bodies,  since  these  are \nhighly political issues and thus required European \npolitical  decision-making  structures.  The  same  is \nnot true of bilateral, or multilateral, currency swap \narrangements.\n\n(US) \n\nGeopolitics  is  also  important.  The  United \nStates \nstrongly  encouraged  postwar \nEuropean integration: even though regional trade \narrangements in Europe imposed a direct economic \ncost on the US, it was willing to pay that price in \norder  to  advance  European  political  integration. \nEuropean  free  trade  areas  that  did  not  involve \nsupranational political elements offered economic \ncosts with no corresponding political benefits; the \nUS was therefore hostile to organizations such as \nthe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) while \nremaining  strongly  supportive  of  the  EEC.  Active \nUS  support  for  the  supranational  approach  to \nEuropean integration was of crucial importance. In \ncontrast, US opposition to Japan\u2019s Asian Monetary \nFund  proposal  in  1997  led  to  the  withdrawal  of \nthat proposal (even though something very similar \nemerged 12 years later, with the multilateralization \nof the CMI).\n\nThe  Cold  War  is  the  key  to  understanding \nwhy  the  US  was  so  keen  to  promote  political \nintegration \nin  Western  Europe  after  1945. \nGermany was essential to the Cold War effort, but \ncould  not  be  allowed  to  re-arm,  or  redevelop  its \nheavy  industries,  without  being  firmly  anchored \nin  a  European  political  framework.  It  is  far  from \nclear  that  the  US  would  have  similar  interests  \nin  the  context  of  21st  century  Asia  were  political \nintegration ever to become a realistic possibility.\n\nEconomics and Security: Integration, \nReinforcement, and Separation\nThe different ways in which regions have linked economic integration \nand  security  provision  have  had  an  impact  on  regional  institutions. \nWhere carefully integrated, peacebuilding and economic integration \nhave  reinforced  each  other  in  some  regions;  in  others,  political  and \nmilitary  conflict  has  disrupted  regional  institutions  and  slowed  the \n\n168\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\ngrowth of cross-border economic exchange. For example, unresolved \nterritorial disputes have depressed trade in Latin America (Simmons \n2006).\n\nit  still \n\nintegrates  security  and  economic \n\nAlthough  Europe  lacks  a  single,  multipurpose,  pan-regional \norganization, \nissues \nsuccessfully.  Initial  security  conditions  in  Europe  favored  regional \ninstitutions  with  substantial  delegated  authority.  However,  an  early \neffort  to  integrate  defense  policies  and  national  militaries,  the \nEuropean  Defence  Community  (EDC),  failed,  and  the  region\u2019s  key \nsecurity  provider  became  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization, \na  highly  institutionalized  alliance.  In  the  contemporary  EU,  foreign \npolicy  and  defense  issues  are  part  of  the  institutional  agenda.  Since \nthe  failure  of  the  EDC,  however,  forging  a  collective  foreign  and \nsecurity  policy  beyond  the  realm  of  commercial  policy  has  lagged \nbehind the development of other common policies (Hix 2005, 2009). \nRecent  institutional  changes,  particularly  the  appointment  of  a  high \nrepresentative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy and the \nplanned  European  External  Action  Service,  aim  to  bolster  the  EU\u2019s \ncommon foreign and security policy. Regional security is also covered \nby  a  wider  network  of  regional  institutions,  such  as  the  Council  of \nEurope and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, \nwhich complement and coordinate with the EU (Kelley 2009).\n\nIn  the  Americas,  peacebuilding  and  economic  integration  have \nadvanced in parallel in a mutually reinforcing relationship. The most \nsuccessful  regional  institutions,  particularly  the  Mercado  Com\u00fan \ndel  Sur  (Mercosur)  and  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement \n(NAFTA),  were  preceded  by  the  resolution  of  longstanding  security \nissues  among  the  key  parties  (Dominguez  2009).  At  the  same  time, \nregional institutions have maintained a clear separation between rules \nand  forums  governing  conflict  within  and  between  states  and  those \ndealing  with  regional  economic  integration.  Consider  the  division \nof  responsibilities  between  the  Organization  of  American  States \n(OAS) and Mercosur. The OAS has had a longstanding role in dispute \nmediation  and  settlement.  It  later  became  the  principal  exponent \nand  enforcer  of  democratic  constitutionalism;  its  new  role  included \nregional intervention in the domestic affairs of its members. It played no \nrole, however, in regional or subregional agreements to liberalize trade \nand investment. Until Mercosur limited membership to democracies \nthrough a treaty amendment in 1997, economic integration treaties did \nnot include any clauses reflecting on the domestic political ordering or \nforeign policy behavior of their members (Dominguez 2007). Security \nand economic issues were dealt with by separate regional institutions.\n\n169\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBox 5.2. Lessons from the Americas\n\nThe  major  regional  economic  integration \n\nschemes in the Americas since 1960 have all \nliberalized trade. Indeed, this was the main \ngoal of the North American Free Trade Agreement \n(NAFTA).  But  while  Latin  America\u2019s  experience \nsuggests  that  a  focus  on  trade \nliberalization \nbolsters  the  chances  of  success,  more  complex \nand  ambitious  economic  integration  schemes \nhave fared poorly.\nAttempts  by \n\nthe \nCentral American Common Market (CACM), and the \nMercado Com\u00fan del Sur (Mercosur) to form common \nmarkets  have  all  failed.  While  trade  liberalization \nmay  succeed\u2014mainly  thanks  to  automatic  rules \nthat  have  low  transaction  costs  and  provide  near-\nterm gains, buttressed by firms that respond quickly \nto profitable new opportunities, generating rewards  \nfor  themselves,  politicians,  and  their  countries\u2014\nmore  far-reaching  integration  is  more  challenging \nand costly and thus less likely to succeed.\n\nthe  Andean  Community, \n\nPolitics,  profits,  and  peace  are  key  factors  in \nexplaining  the  success  (or  failure)  of  regional \neconomic  institutions  in  the  Americas.  Strong \npresidential leadership was key to the founding of \nMercosur  and  NAFTA,  and  the  reactivation  of  the \nCACM in the 1990s. In contrast, presidents played \nlittle  role  in  the  ill-starred  Latin  American  Free \nTrade  Association  (LAFTA).  Profits  can  provide  a \ndecisive  incentive.  Firms  seized  the  opportunities \ncreated  by  unilateral \nliberalization, \nincreasing intraregional trade even before regional \nagreements  were  established.  Businesses  found \nfewer  opportunities  in  LAFTA.  Peace  was  also  a \nprerequisite for success. It was critical to NAFTA\u2019s \nnegotiation  and  implementation  against  difficult \nodds, and also helped Mercosur survive crises and \nmisguided decisions. In contrast, the threat of war \nhampered  the  Andean  Community  in  the  1990s \nand 2000s, just as the threat\u2014and reality\u2014of war \nundermined the CACM in 1969 and since the 1980s.\n\ntrade \n\nIn certain subregions of Latin America, such as Central America, \nas  well  as  in  the  Middle  East  and  Africa,  a  third  pattern  linked \neconomics  and  security.  In  these  areas,  conflict  has  undermined \nor  slowed  regional  integration  and  institution  building.  In  Central \nAmerica, regional insecurity and conflict reduced intraregional trade in \nthe 1980s, while militarized disputes prevented a deepening of existing \nregional  institutions.  Sustained  peace  was  not  required,  however,  to \nliberalize and expand trade in this and other cases, such as the Andean \nGroup (Dominguez 2009). Box 5.2 looks at lessons from the Americas.\nIn  Africa,  where  regional  economic  integration  is  lower,  conflict \nhas been costlier. Although the African Union (AU) has begun to play a \nrole similar to that of the OAS in peacekeeping and conflict resolution, \nconflict has often undermined subregional institutions. The Economic \nCommunity  of  Central  African  States  (ECCAS)  lapsed  into  inactivity \nduring  the  1990s  because  of  internal  conflict  in  its  member  states; \n\n170\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nremains \n\nresolution \n\ndespite  recent  efforts  to  revive  it,  its  regional  agenda  of  economic \nintegration  and  conflict \nlargely  unfulfilled \n(Khadiagala 2009). Disagreements over the status of Western Sahara \nhave paralyzed the Arab Maghreb Union: no meeting among heads of \nstate  has  taken  place  since  1994.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  multilateral \nMiddle  East  peace  process  sought  to  link  economic  integration  with \nnegotiations  on  core  security  issues,  such  as  refugees  and  arms \ncontrol, bridging the Arab\u2013Israeli divide, but regional opponents have \nsince undermined the process (Barnett and Solingen 2007).\n\nIn  integrating  Asia,  economics  and  security  relations  run  on \nseparate tracks, neither hindering nor reinforcing one another. Political \nconflict and militarized disputes are seldom allowed to inhibit mutual \neconomic  interests  in  expanding  trade  and  investment.  Regional \ngovernments avoid sanctions and other economic measures that seek \nto  change  a  target  state\u2019s  policies.  Regional  economic  institutions \nreflect  this  separation,  with  few  links  between  institutions  that  deal \nwith economic issues and those, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum \n(ARF),  that  address  security  concerns.  Particularly  in  Northeast  Asia, \nthis  separation  has  permitted  the  growth  of  trade,  investment,  and \neconomic  cooperation  even  in  the  presence  of  persistent  territorial \nand political disputes.\n\nDespite these benefits of a two-track approach to economics and \nsecurity, the Asian pattern has not promoted the political reconciliation \nor military confidence building that either preceded or accompanied \nregional  initiatives  in  Europe  and  Latin  America.  In  Southeast  Asia, \nASEAN  may  represent  a  partial  exception  to  the  prevailing  Asian \npattern: it involves a code of state conduct (ASEAN\u2019s Treaty of Amity \nand  Cooperation)  and  norms  of  cooperative  behavior  that  have \npreceded the building of institutions of regional economic cooperation \n(the ASEAN Free Trade Area\u2014AFTA).\n\nExperience  elsewhere  suggests  that  Asia  might  benefit  from \nmodifying its prevailing two-track approach to economics and security. \nThe  careful  separation  of  economic  cooperation  from  the  troubled \nrealm  of  political  and  military  conflict  has  served  the  region  well \nduring its decades of enterprise-driven economic integration. Moving \nto a more ambitious agenda of deeper integration may require a closer \nlinkage between economics and security, on either the networked and \nintegrated European model or the Latin American pattern of sequential \nor  parallel  movement  toward  economic  integration  and  conflict \nresolution. An Asia-wide peak institution could provide the forum for \nsuch linkage, or networked ties among existing security and economic \ninstitutions could be engineered to achieve similar results. Moreover, \n\n171\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nexperience  in  both  Europe  (the  EU)  and  the  Americas  (NAFTA  and \nMercosur) strongly suggests that deeper economic integration requires \npolitical reconciliation and a reduction in military tensions among the \nprincipal participants.\n\nFeedback Effects and the Demand for Regional \nInstitutions\nFeedback  effects  have  boosted \nthe  development  of  regional \ninstitutions in Europe. Successive waves of regional liberalization have \nbolstered  the  strength  of  export  interests  as  well  as  their  demands \nfor  further  liberalization,  while  regional  institutions  themselves  have \nalso  adopted  strategies  to  reinforce  their  own  role.  Economic  and \ninstitutional  feedback  effects  created  political  support  for  widening \nthe liberalization agenda in the EEC and tipped European governments \nagainst  the  European  Free  Trade  Association  (EFTA).  The  greater \neconomic  weight  of  the  EEC  exerted  a  magnetic  pull  for  trading \ninterests  outside  the  community.  The  same  mechanisms,  which \nwere  dependent  on  a  benign  international  trade  environment,  have \noperated  outside  Europe.  In  other  regions,  however,  the  outcomes \ndid  not  uniformly  strengthen  regional  institutions.  Latin  American \nregional  institutions  were  often  born  after  an  initial  unilateral  round \nof  liberalization  by  national  governments.  In  certain  cases,  such  as \nthe  Central  America  Free  Trade  Agreement  and  Mercosur,  unilateral \nliberalization served as a costly signal of intent for trading partners as \nwell as reflecting exporters\u2019 growing political power.\n\nIn  Asia,  the  feedback  between  trade  expansion  and  regional \ninstitution  building  has  been  even  more  tenuous.  Unlike  the  EEC, \na  regional  core  with  a  comprehensive  and  discriminatory  trade \narrangement  to  attract  prospective  members  has  not  emerged. \nExporters\u2019  demands  for  further  liberalization  could  be  satisfied \nlargely  through  global  trade  negotiations  rather  than  regional  free \ntrade agreements (FTAs), while liberalization that promoted regional \neconomic integration did not always support more effective regional \ninstitutions.  The  trade  liberalization  in  many  developing  economies \nthat began in the 1980s and then accelerated owed relatively little to \nregional  economic  institutions.  Outside  Europe,  an  agenda  of  deep \nintegration  has  not  been  seriously  attempted.  The  question  for  Asia \n(and other regions) is whether the feedback mechanisms that increase \ndemands for further trade liberalization will eventually produce calls \nfor a common market, which was incorporated as a long-term goal for \nEurope in the Treaty of Rome, the EEC\u2019s founding act signed in 1957. \n\n172\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nA common market, with accompanying political demands for a level \nplaying field across  a wide  range of  domestic policies, could in turn \nrequire greater regional institutionalization.\n\nIn the domain of regional monetary and financial cooperation, the \nEuropean  model\u2014whereby  as  trade  integration  increases,  domestic \ninterest groups demand exchange rate cooperation and such demands \nintensify after capital controls are lifted\u2014applies only weakly to other \nregions. Macroeconomic instability in Mercosur following the Brazilian \nand  Argentine  exchange  rate  crises  (1999\u20132002)  induced  a  decline \nin  intra-Mercosur  trade  but  no  progress  toward  economic  policy \ncoordination  or  exchange  rate  collaboration.  In  Asia,  governments \nsatisfied  domestic  coalitions  that  favored  stable  exchange  rates  by \npegging to the dollar or a basket of currencies, another consequence \nof the region\u2019s openness.\n\nMonetary  and  financial  cooperation  in  Asia  and  the  Middle  East \nhas  followed  a  different  dynamic.  In  both  East  Asia  (the  Chiang  Mai \nInitiative  [CMI])  and  the  Gulf  Cooperation  Council  (GCC),  monetary \nand  financial  cooperation  moved  toward \ninstitutionalization  and \ndeeper  cooperation  faster  than  one  might  expect  given  the  respective \nregions\u2019  trade  integration  and  degree  of  capital  account  liberalization. \nIn  Asia,  the  shock  of  the  1997/98  financial  crisis  and  discontent  with \nglobal institutions\u2019 response to it moved ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN+3) \ncountries toward arrangements that would offer mutual support during \nfinancial crises. Although the GCC, an island of relative liberalization in \nthe Middle East, has made only slow progress in trade integration (despite \nthe  negotiation  of  a  common  market  in  2008),  its  plans  for  monetary \ncooperation  are  ambitious,  aiming  for  monetary  union  by  2010.  If \nimplemented successfully, the GCC monetary union would be second in \neconomic importance only to Europe\u2019s Economic and Monetary Union \n(Solingen  2009).86  Despite  the  economic  openness  of  GCC  members, \nits  moves  toward  monetary  union  do  not  appear  driven  by  feedback \nfrom trade liberalization. Instead, the GCC and other monetary unions \nin the developing world point to possible spillovers from monetary and \nfinancial cooperation to other areas of economic cooperation.\n\nIf the operation of feedback mechanisms and specific institutional \nsequencing  has  been  more  uncertain  outside  Europe,  what  Baldwin \n(2009)  labels  institutional  feedback\u2014a  prominent  driver  of  European \nintegration\u2014was  largely  absent  in  other  regions.  At  key  moments, \nEuropean economic integration was promoted by the actions of existing \n\n86  Four members of the GCC\u2014Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia\u2014signed its monetary \n\nunion agreement in December 2009. Oman and the United Arab Emirates decided not to join.\n\n173\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nregional institutions with substantial delegated authority and a mandate \nto  promote  economic  integration.  Asia  has  not  built  institutions,  akin \nto  the  European  Court  of  Justice  or  the  European  Commission,  with \nenough  delegated  authority  to  influence  further  integrative  steps. \nLikewise,  regional  institutions  in  the  Americas  have  been  unable  to \ninitiate a feedback mechanism that would promote the strengthening \nof regional institutions and deepening of economic cooperation.\n\nDespite Mercosur\u2019s relatively elaborate institutions, trade expansion \nproduced  little  concomitant  pressure  to  increase  the  scope  of  the \ncustoms union by including such areas as trade in services, competition \npolicy, or coordination of social policy (Dominguez 2009). NAFTA was \ndesigned  without  significant  regional  institutions,  and  the  growth  of \nNorth  American  trade  did  not  change  its  institutional  architecture. \nModest steps, such as the multilateralization of swap lines among the \nUS, Canada, and Mexico, were driven by concern over Mexican financial \ncrises,  not  by  NAFTA  institutions.  Europe\u2019s  initial  conditions,  which \nawarded it a panoply of influential regional institutions, also gave those \ninstitutions unique possibilities for deepening economic integration.\n\nComparative analysis of feedback mechanisms that promote the \nbuilding  and  strengthening  of  regional  institutions  confirms  diverse \nregional  patterns.  Europe\u2019s  progression  from  trade  liberalization  and \na  common  market  to  financial  liberalization  and  monetary  union \nmay  not  be  the  only  viable  sequence;  the  feedback  mechanisms \nthat  have  driven  regional  integration  in  Europe  may  produce  similar \nresults elsewhere.87 Other regions were often able to find substitutes \nfor  strengthened  regional  institutions  that  satisfied  demands  from \ntrade-dependent  economic  constituencies\u2014unilateral  liberalization, \nparticipation  in  global  trade  rounds,  exchange  rate  pegs.  A  central \nunanswered question is whether these processes of substitution and \npolitically driven institution building must give way to more substantial \nregional institutions when governments move from trade liberalization \nto an agenda of deeper integration in which a wide array of domestic \npolicies become objects of negotiation.\n\nGlobal, Regional, and Subregional Institutions: \nA Division of Labor?\nCompared  to  those  in  other  regions,  Asian  governments  have  been \n\u201cglobalists.\u201d Asian economies, as documented in Chapter 2, have been \nuniquely  successful  in  connecting  to  global  markets  and  production \n\n87  See, for example, Wyplosz (2006) for a dissent from the necessity of trade integration rather \n\nthan monetary cooperation as a prerequisite for deeper economic integration. \n\n174\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nnetworks.  With  few  exceptions,  they  have  sought  membership  in \nthe  key  global  economic  institutions  and  made  use  of  the  dispute \nsettlement  mechanisms  provided  by  those  institutions,  particularly  \nthe World Trade Organization (WTO). Other regions are more reliant \non  regional  institutions  (Europe);  more  wary  of  global  institutions \n(Latin  America\u2019s  unhappy  history  with  the  International  Monetary  \nFund  [IMF]);  or  remain  suspicious  of  membership  in  any  regional \nor  global  institutions  with  substantial  authority  (the  Middle  East\u2019s \nreluctance to embrace either the WTO or effective regional institutions).\nAsia  has  distanced  itself  from  global  economic  institutions  over \nthe  past  decade,  however.  Disenchantment  with  global  financial \ninstitutions during the 1997/98 financial crisis gave impetus to the CMI; \nthe  stalemate  of  the  WTO\u2019s  Doha  Round  may  also  lend  support  for \ndeepening regional trade institutions. Even so, given the openness of \nthe Asian regional economy, the global option will remain attractive, \nparticularly  for  the  largest  economies  (Japan,  the  People\u2019s  Republic \nof China, India). These global affiliations and attractions indicate that \nregional institutions in Asia should attempt to complement, rather than \nduplicate, the functions of global ones.\n\nGiven  its  investment  in  the  global  trade  regime,  Asia  has  a \ngreater  interest  than  most  other  regions  in  ensuring  that  regional \nrules and institutions are consistent with global ones. One means of \nensuring  such  consistency  lies  in  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs \nand Trade (GATT) Article XXIV and the General Agreement on Trade \nin  Services  Article  V,  which  permit  regional  trade  agreements  under \ncertain  conditions,  even  though  they  violate  the  core  GATT/WTO \nprinciple  of  nondiscrimination  (most-favored-nation  treatment  for \nmembers). The WTO\u2019s weak oversight of these agreements (through \nthe Committee on Regional Trade Agreements) and their proliferation \nover the past two decades led to their inclusion in the current Doha \nRound of trade negotiations.\n\nWith global trade negotiations stalled, the challenge of interpreting \nand  enforcing  the  global  rules  that  govern  regional  free  trade  areas \nremains. The task of ensuring their consistency with global rules may \nfall in part  to regional institutions. Given the  importance to Asia of a \nrobust  global  trade  regime,  existing  and  emerging  Asian  regional \ninstitutions  could  lead  the  way.  A  region-wide  institution  could \nassume this role, ensuring complementarity without precluding Asian \neconomic agreements that wish to implement a \u201cWTO-plus\u201d agenda.\nThe  issue  of  complementarity  with  a  central  global  institution, \nthe IMF, also arises with regional monetary and financial cooperation. \nRegional and plurilateral financial facilities have been a longstanding \nfeature  of  international  monetary  and  financial  relations,  beginning \n\n175\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nwith  the  European  Payments  Union  (if  not  before).  However,  global \nrules to govern regional arrangements for financial support have not \nbeen established (Henning 2006).\n\nSince  such  facilities  have  been  relatively  rare  and  concentrated \namong  advanced  economies,  coordination  with  the  IMF  in  financial \ncrisis management has not been difficult. Nevertheless, ground rules \nfor  coordination  between  regional  financial  facilities,  such  as  the \nChiang  Mai  Initiative  Multilateralisation  (CMIM)  or  an  eventual  Asian \nMonetary  Fund,  would  ensure  that  regional  financial  cooperation \nreinforces  rather  than  undermines  global  institutions,  adding  to  the \nbenefits for members. In particular, a weakly institutionalized financial \nsupport  facility  should  designate  a  clear  line  of  communication  and \nnegotiation  with  the  IMF,  establish  adequate  surveillance  capacity \nbefore severing the IMF \u201clink\u201d to the use of regional funds, and, most \ndifficult politically, consult with the IMF on the content of conditionality \nand  the  coordination  of  disbursements  (Henning  2006,  2009a).  The \nunderstandings negotiated between the CMIM and the IMF could also \nbe  generalized  to  similar  regional  arrangements,  filling  a  void  in  the \nglobal rules governing these institutions.\n\nGlobal  institutions  have  provided  one  source  of  both  useful \ncomplementarity and potential competition with regional institutions. \nSubregional organizations may also compete with one another and with \nwider regional arrangements, producing uncertain effects on regional \neconomic integration. With the exception of Asia, other regions have \na region-wide, often political, institution (or institutions) in addition to \nsubregional institutions with primarily economic functions.\n\nAsia\u2019s subregional institutional landscape is also unusual. Northeast \nAsia,  its  largest  economic  region,  lacks  any  significant  economic \ninstitutions; ASEAN, representing a smaller subregional economy, has \nplayed a leading role in designing region-wide initiatives (ASEAN+3, \nARF).  In  addition,  bilateral  and  plurilateral  trade  agreements  have \nproliferated  in  Asia  over  the  past  decade,  unconstrained  by  region-\nwide agreement on their contents. This pattern of subregional strength \nand  region-wide  weakness  in  institutionalization  underscores  the \npossibility  of  competition  between  subregional  groups  and  future \nregion-wide institutions.\n\nEvidence  from  other  regions  about  the  effects  of  subregional \norganizations  on  regional  economic  institutions  is  inconclusive.  In \nEurope,  the  dynamic  of  trade  discrimination  combined  with  the \nEEC\u2019s economic weight to induce most members of EFTA to defect, a \ndomino effect that ultimately reduced EFTA to four small economies \nand  confirmed  the  EEC/EU  model  of  regional  integration  (O\u2019Rourke \n\n176\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\n2009; Baldwin 2009). The EU became a regional institution with both \na political role in advancing democracy and enhancing security and a \ncentral economic role in European integration.\n\nthe \n\nlead \n\ntaken \n\nRegion-wide \n\ninstitutions  elsewhere  are  primarily  political; \nsubregional  organizations  have \nin  economic \nintegration.  The  Organization  of  African  Unity  (OAU)  played  an \nimportant  postcolonial  role  in  confirming  existing  African  borders \n(Herbst  2007;  Khadiagala  2009).  Its  successor,  the  African  Union, \nand  the  OAS  in  the  Americas  have  mediated  disputes  among  their \nmembers  and  participated  in  peacekeeping  missions  (Dominguez \n2007,  2009).  The  League  of  Arab  States  (LAS)  had  an  expansive \nideological  (pan-Arab),  political,  and  economic  mandate,  but  was \nless effective than its region-wide peers (Barnett and Solingen 2007; \nSolingen 2009).\n\ninstitutions  and \n\nBecause  of  this  implicit  division  of  labor  between  subregional \neconomic \nregion-wide  political  and  security \norganizations,  little  overt  friction  resulted  between  them.  When \nbroader  regional  economic  initiatives  were  undertaken,  subregional \ncompetition  did  not  seem  a  prominent  obstacle  to  their  successful \nnegotiation  and  implementation.  The  US-backed  region-wide  Free \nTrade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was defeated not by competition \nfrom  subregional  organizations,  but  by  the  US  decision  to  favor \nbilateral and plurilateral FTAs, which undermined the credibility of its \nsupport, and by opposition from regional governments, notably Brazil \nand Argentina (Dominguez 2009).\n\nThe Greater Arab Free Trade Area sponsored by the Arab League \nhas  enjoyed  some  success  in  reducing  tariff  barriers  among  its \nmembers; the limited nature of its economic agenda appears to owe \nlittle to the fragmented subregional landscape of economic integration \nin the Middle East (Broude 2009). Subregional competition has hindered \neconomic integration in Africa, but it is competition among subregional \norganizations  with  overlapping  mandates  and  membership  that  has \npresented the greatest obstacle (Khadiagala 2009).\n\nRegion-wide institutions have diverse mandates, although nearly \nall  concentrate  on  political  or  security  agendas,  leaving  economic \nintegration to subregional groups. The major exception, the EU, began \nas  a  subregional  organization  that  outcompeted  its  principal  rival  by \nattracting the overwhelming majority of members in Europe. No other \nsubregional  economic  grouping  has  won  region-wide  status  in  this \nway.  As  Asia  contemplates  its  own  region-wide  institutions, whether \nthe  East  Asian  Summit  or  a  new  group,  it  is  not  encumbered  by  a \npostcolonial organization with a fixed agenda.\n\n177\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBox 5.3. Regionalism in Africa\n\nfor  ways \n\nRegional  cooperation  has  played  an \n\nimportant  role \nin  Africa\u2019s  postcolonial \nhistory.  Since  the  1960s  this  has  entailed \nto  overcome  political \na  search \nfragmentation,  promote  development, \nand \nincrease  Africa\u2019s  global  competitiveness.  But \nthis  has  not  been  easy,  given  Africa\u2019s  cultural, \neconomic,  and  geographic  diversity.  As  a  result, \nAfrica  has  sought \nto  build  continent-wide \ninstitutions  for  security  and  political  cooperation, \nalongside a panoply of subregional experiments in \neconomic integration.\n\nAfrica\u2019s  continent-wide \n\ninstitutions  have \nfocused on promoting political unity, security, and a \nunified global voice, through first the Organization \nof African Unity (OAU) and then the African Union \n(AU), inspired by the ideals of pan-Africanism, self-\ndetermination,  and  African  dignity.  The  OAU  did \nlittle to promote collective security, however, and \nit was disbanded in 2002. Through the AU, African \ncountries  have  sought  more  robust  measures \nto  promote  security,  including  intervention  in \n\ndomestic conflicts and planning for peacekeeping \noperations.\n\nAfrican  efforts  at  subregional \n\ninstitution \nbuilding  are  based  on  geographical  contiguities \nand  cultural  proximities.  They  have  involved  the \ncreation of free trade agreements, customs unions, \ncommon  markets,  and  potential  avenues  for \npolitical federations. Diverse institutions such as the \nArab Maghreb Union, the East African Community, \nthe  Common  Market  for  Eastern  and  Southern \nAfrican  States, \nthe  Economic  Community  of  \nWest  African  States,  the  Economic  Community  of \nCentral  African  States,  and  the  Southern  African \nDevelopment  Community,  among  others,  have \nbeen  at  the  forefront  of  subregional  integration. \nMost  of  these  institutions  increasingly  focus  on \nexpanding  trade,  attracting  foreign  investment, \nand  boosting  infrastructure  development.  There \nhave  been  external  and  internal  pressures  to \nrationalize subregional institutions with overlapping \nmemberships.  Some  have  made  efforts  to  merge \nand collaborate along more functional lines.\n\nA new region-wide institution in Asia could take on some of the \npolitical and foreign policy aims of peers like the AU or OAS, such as \ndefending  constitutional  government,  mediation,  and  peacekeeping. \nIt  might  also  oversee  subregional  economic  projects,  ensuring  their \nconsistency (with each other as well as with global rules and norms) \nand transparency. Such a region-wide institution would not undertake \nits  own  program  to  promote  economic  integration\u2014a  task  best  left \nto  smaller  groups  of  \u201ccooperators\u201d  organized  along  subregional  or \nfunctional  lines.  In  effect,  the  new  region-wide  organization  could \nensure  an  appropriate  division  of  labor  among  global,  regional,  and \nsubregional  institutions  in  promoting  economic  integration.  Box  5.3 \nlooks at regionalism in Africa.\n\n178\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nContingencies: Economic Crises and Shocks\nRegional  initiatives  are  shaped  by  their  initial  environment  and \npunctuated by exogenous shocks as they develop. Initial conditions in \nEurope after 1945 predisposed some European governments toward a \nparticular model of regional integration\u2014one that pooled sovereignty \nand delegated substantial authority to regional institutions, rather than \nrelying on FTAs with less elaborate institutions (Baldwin 2009; O\u2019Rourke \n2009). Insecurity, an unforgiving international economic environment, \nand Europe\u2019s preference for more interventionist government policies \ntilted the pattern of European institutions in a supranational direction \n(at least within the EEC/EU).\n\nTwo threats to European security lingered after its two catastrophic \n\u201ccivil wars\u201d in the first half of the 20th century. The possibility of a third \nEuropean war was a pressing concern for the founders of European \ninstitutions.  Embedding  West  Germany  in  European  institutions  was \nseen  as  guaranteeing  a  more  secure  future.  Political  reconciliation \nbetween the two arch-rivals, France and Germany, was easier within \ninstitutions  with  greater  authority,  which  constrained  the  power  of \nan  economically  resurgent  West  Germany  as  well  as  providing  an \navenue  for  its  readmission  to  normal  statehood.  Franco\u2013German \nunderstanding  served  as  the  foundation  for  successive  European \nregional  initiatives.  Backed  by  the  US,  European  institutions  allowed \nEuropean  governments  to  confront  their  Cold  War  insecurities: \neconomic  integration  and  common  institutions  were  both  a  symbol \nand an instrument of a European counterweight to Soviet power.\n\nEurope  also  confronted  a  bleak \n\ninternational  economic \nenvironment in the post-1945 years. The world economy was riddled \nwith state-imposed controls on trade, financial flows, and migration. \nIf liberalization were to occur through global negotiations, its progress \nwould likely be slow: a prediction confirmed by the US failure to ratify \nthe thereby stillborn International Trade Organization and the sluggish \npace  of  GATT  negotiations  in  the  1950s.  Most  of  the  initial  work  on \ntrade and current account liberalization had to occur at the regional \nlevel, reinforced by nascent European economic institutions.\n\nA third important factor was Western Europeans\u2019 preference\u2014for \na variety of reasons, including Europe\u2019s status as the first industrialized \nregion\u2014for more interventionist states, and in particular for relatively \nhigh levels of social protection in areas such as agriculture and labor \nrelations. Europe\u2019s mixed-economy model demanded more elaborate \nregional  institutions  to  secure  these  domestic  bargains  and  ensure \nthat they would not be undermined by regional economic integration \n\n179\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n(O\u2019Rourke 2009). From the start, European institutions were designed \nnot  solely  to  further  economic  liberalization;  they  also  served  as  a \nsafeguard for domestic policies and programs that buffered European \nsocieties and interest groups against economic volatility.\n\nAlthough  Europe\u2019s  combination  of  initial  conditions  appears \nunique, economic crisis has also served to stimulate regional institution \nbuilding elsewhere. Latin America\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d in the 1980s was the \nseedbed for both new and redesigned regional integration initiatives. \nThe 1997/98 financial crisis spurred Asia to reconsider its relationship \nto  global  institutions  and  the  performance  of  its  regional  institutions \nduring the crisis.\n\nInsecurity  and  international  economic  shocks  may  promote \nregional  institutions  through  at  least  two  mechanisms.  If  global \ninstitutions and the world economy appear unresponsive or unlikely to \nsupport sustained economic growth, regional institutions may emerge \nas  an  appealing  alternative  for  governments  intent  on  economic \nliberalization. External threats may also provide a necessary short-term \npolitical  justification\u2014such  as  peace\u2014for  both  regional  economic \nintegration  and  vesting  substantial  authority  in  regional  institutions \n(Wyplosz 2006).\n\nContemporary Asia and other regions of the developing world share \nfew  of  these  initial  conditions  for  a  leap  to  regional  institutions  with \nsubstantial supranational authority. Regional and global environments \nare unlikely to promote a rapid turn toward institutions as elaborate as \nthose of the EEC/EU. Despite the persistence of militarized interstate \ndisputes  in  Asia,  its  levels  of  insecurity  have  not  approached  those \nof  post-1945  Europe  for  decades.  Occasional  shocks,  including \nones  as  wrenching  as  the  1997/98  crisis,  have  not  upended  Asia\u2019s \nsuccessful economic integration, which is rooted in enterprising firms, \nunilateral liberalization by national governments, and an international \neconomy  open  to  Asian  exports  after  successive  rounds  of  global \ntrade  negotiations.  Asian  regional  institutions  have  not,  as  a  result, \nbeen  needed  to  oversee  and  enforce  the  initial  stages  of  economic \nopening. As Asian societies industrialize, however, domestic demands \nfor environmental, consumer, and labor-market regulation may create \nnew mandates for regional institutions to maintain a level playing field \nfor international competition. In this respect, Asia\u2019s status as a newly \nindustrialized region could foster the same institutional response that \nEurope, the first industrialized region, displayed in the initial stages of \nits regional integration.\n\n180\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\n5.3. Designing Effective Institutions\n\nRegional comparisons confirm the importance of institutional design: \ninstitutions themselves can promote further integration and additional \ninstitution building. In rare cases, such as Europe, regional institutions \nare designed to provide institutional feedback that spurs their further \ndevelopment (Baldwin 2009). In a much more modest way, Asia has \nrelied on ad hoc entities, such as eminent persons\u2019 groups or the East \nAsia Vision Group, to offer alternative institutional futures.\n\nFeedback from existing institutions is not always positive: once in \nplace, institutions may impede new institutional initiatives or constrain \ntheir  design.  Little  authority  was  delegated  to  regional  institutions \nat  NAFTA\u2019s  foundation,  and  they  have  not  been  strengthened  since. \nSlight evidence of positive institutional feedback can been discerned \nin  Latin  America  (Mercosur,  Central  American  Common  Market \n[CACM]). The mere presence of regional institutions may not produce a  \nself-sustaining deepening of institutionalized collaboration. Institutions \nmust be designed to further integration and its dynamics, which may \nin turn promote demand for additional institutionalization.\n\nRegional institutions\u2019 potential scope is set, at least initially, by a \nregion\u2019s characteristics and the dynamics of regional integration. Given \nthose initial conditions, however, institutions\u2019 design determines their \neffectiveness. Decision rules may allow more or less decisiveness in \nmeeting  regional  demands.  Commitment  mechanisms  incorporated \nin regional institutions can create a \u201cratchet effect\u201d that consolidates \nexisting  integration  gains  as  well  as  encourages  a  deepening  of \nintegration  in  politically  contentious  policy  areas.  Membership  rules \naffect prospects for admitting additional national governments or entire \nsubregions.  Variations  in  institutional  design  across  regions  highlight \nboth the ways in which member governments have attempted to fulfill \ncooperative  mandates  and  the  consequences  of  those  choices  for \ninstitutional effectiveness.\n\nDecision Rules: Conservatism and Consensus\nThe  EU  has  enacted  voting  rules  that  incorporate  weighted  voting \nand  supermajorities  (qualified  majority  voting) \nin  an  effort  to \nstreamline  decision-making  by  an  expanded  membership.  Asian \ngovernments, like those in most regions other than Europe, have opted \nfor  conservative  voting  rules,  typically  consensus  decision-making. \n\n181\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nIf  regional  institutions  try  to  tackle  the  agenda  of  deeper  integration \nin  tandem  with  the  creation  of  large-membership  organizations\u2014in \nother  words,  if  they  try  to  deepen  and  widen  simultaneously\u2014the \nintroduction of more efficient decision-making formulas may become \nmore likely (and indeed necessary).\n\nEven now, consensus decision rules are not always followed. In \nASEAN, for example, notwithstanding public declarations embracing \nthe  consensus  norm,  the  consensus  rule  is  set  aside  behind  the \nscenes  when  enough  member  governments  care  strongly  enough \nabout the issue under consideration. The launch by ASEAN+3 finance \nministers  of  the  CMIM,  which  involves  weighted-majority  decision-\nmaking,  indicates  a  willingness  to  consider  more  efficient  rules \nfor  an  organization  that  must  act  decisively  during  financial  crises. \n\nBox 5.4. Voting Rules for Regional Institutions\n\nA s  regional  integration  proceeds  from  trade \n\nto more complex and contentious behind-\nthe-border  policies,  it  becomes  tougher  to \nprevent progress from being held captive or slowed \nby  individual  country  interests  and  objections. \nCountries  that  strongly  favor  further  regional \nintegration  will  therefore  want  to  contemplate \nalternatives  to  consensus-based  decision-making \nprocedures.  For  example,  the  European  Union \n(EU) decided to use a system of \u201cqualified-majority \nvoting\u201d as part of the program to complete its single \nmarket  by  1992,  and  the  success  of  this  voting \nsystem prompted member governments to extend \nit to a wide range of policy issues.\n\nIn  general,  a  country  is  likely  to  consider \nseveral factors when deciding whether to support \na move to majority voting. On which issues is the \ncountry  likely  to  be  on  the  losing  or  the  winning \nside\u2014and how important are  they  relative  to  the \nissues  on  which  it  might  lose?  Also,  on  average, \nhow  important  are  the  collective  benefits  for  the \ninstitution  for  regional  integration  (IRI)  of  being \nable  to  make  faster  and  more  efficient  collective \ndecisions?  In  the  Asian  context,  three  questions \n\ncan  be  raised.  First,  what  exactly  would  be  the \nstructure  of \nthe  new  decision-making  rules \nconstituting an alternative to consensus? Second, \nwhat specific range of policies would be covered? \nThird, for what countries and issues might such a \nmove be most attractive?\n\nAn  obvious  alternative  to  consensus  is  some \nform  of  qualified-majority  voting  system,  where \neach country is given  a specific number of votes \n(usually  corresponding  to  the  relative  size  of  its \npopulation)  and  a  supermajority  threshold  must \nbe reached for a decision to pass. Requiring less \nthan full unanimity for the adoption of a measure \nprevents \nfrom  blocking \nprogress. While large countries are typically given \nmore votes than small countries\u2014as in the Chiang \nMai  Initiative  Multilateralisation  (CMIM)\u2014it  is  not \nuncommon for smaller countries to have a larger \nshare of votes than their population shares so as to \nprotect them from the tyranny of large countries.\n\nindividual  countries \n\nThe  precise  qualified-majority  threshold  that  \nwould need to be met in a particular policy area \ncould  be  varied  according  to  the  sensitivity  of \nthe  issues  involved.  For  example,  in  the  CMIM \n\n182\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nEven  more  complex voting  rules can  be  devised in order  to achieve \nadequate  representation  for  both  larger  and  smaller  economies  in  a \nwider regional institution that includes India. Hix (2009) has designed \na  hypothetical  voting  arrangement  that  would  both  empower  and \nconstrain the largest economies in the region  and provide adequate \nvoice for medium-sized and smaller economies in regional decision-\nmaking.  Such  designs\u2014one  or  two  steps  from  consensus  decision-\nmaking\u2014can be combined with applying different rules by issue area \nor  type  of  decision  (for  instance,  reverting  to  consensus  decision-\nmaking when a new grant of authority is made to regional institutions) \nin  order  to  construct  a  hybrid  model  that  protects  the  interests  of \nmember  governments  from  both  larger  and  smaller  states.  Box  5.4 \nlooks in greater depth at voting rules for regional institutions.\n\nthe threshold for a decision to pass is 50% of the \nweighted  votes  of  the  countries  involved.  In  the \nEU, the threshold during the period of completing \nthe  single  market  was  just  over  70%  of  the \nweighted  votes  of  member  states,  whereas  on \nsome technical implementation issues only a 50% \nvote  (a  \u201csimple  majority\u201d)  of  EU  governments  is \nrequired.  On  any  policy  issue  a  higher  threshold \nmeans  that  a  broader  coalition  is  required  for  a \ndecision to pass, which might be a reason to use \none in more sensitive policy areas.\n\nThere  are  several  other  alternatives  to  a \nsimple- or qualified-majority system. For example, \nfollowing  the  entry  into  force  of  the  Treaty  of \nLisbon,  the  EU  will  move  to  a  \u201cdouble-majority\u201d \nsystem, where a policy can only be passed if it is \nsupported  by  55%  of  the  countries  (15  out  of  the \ncurrent  27  EU  member  states),  which  must  also \nrepresent  at  least  65%  of  the  total  population  of \nthe  EU.  However,  sensitive  issues  will  continue \nto be decided on the basis of unanimity: broadly \nspeaking  these  include  tax,  social,  and  foreign \npolicy  and  treaty  revision.  Where  unanimous \nagreement is required, the EU operates a system of \n\n\u201cpositive unanimity,\u201d whereby an abstention does \nnot  count  as  a  negative  vote.  This  often  allows \none or more countries to abstain and still allow a \ndecision to go ahead rather than vote against and \nbe responsible for blocking it.\n\nExisting members of overarching subregional \nIRIs  such  as  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  or  functional  IRIs  such  as  the \nCMIM could follow suit. They could draft and sign \na  protocol  or  treaty  specifying  the  policy  actions \nthat  would  be  decided  by  qualified-majority  (or \ndouble-majority)  voting  and  making  clear  that \nactions  not  specified  would  be  decided  on  the \nbasis  of  unanimity.  It  will  no  doubt  be  argued \nthat  individual  countries  will  be  reluctant  to \nsurrender their veto power. But where the majority \nstrongly values effective action and it is not clear \nex  ante  who  will  be  in  the  minority,  there  may \nbe  a  willingness  to  go  along.  Revealingly,  CMIM \nmembers  have  reportedly  agreed  to  move  to \nmaking  disbursement  decisions  on  the  basis  of \nqualified-majority  voting  (where  votes  may  be \nrelated  to  the  contribution  shares  agreed  at  their \nspring 2009 meeting in Bali).\n\n183\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nCommitment through Political Engagement, \nLegalization, and Enfranchisement\nAs regional institutions seek to entrench past gains from liberalization and \nventure  into  politically  sensitive  issues  of  deeper  integration,  effective \ncommitment  mechanisms  will  become  essential.  Asian  regional \ninstitutions display a unique combination of these mechanisms (or their \nabsence): high-level summits have played a central role in most regional \ninstitutions; legalization has been relatively low in all of its aspects; and \nprivate, nonstate actors have not been enfranchised to any significant \ndegree.  This  combination  has  failed  to  produce  a  self-sustaining \ndynamic  for  further  institutionalization,  alone  or  in  combination  with \nother dynamics based on growing trade and investment flows.\n\nPolitical Engagement\nAround the world, high-level political engagement has been essential \nfor  the  successful  launch  of  regional  institutions.  The  Americas \nhighlight the benefits\u2014and costs\u2014of such involvement. Support from \ntop  political  leaders  was  critical  to  the  foundation  of  both  Mercosur  \nand NAFTA; early initiatives in Latin America that relied on technocratic \nexpertise  alone,  such  as  the  Latin  American  Free  Trade  Association, \nfailed (Dominguez 2009). Where high-level political involvement was \nnot  constrained  by  effective  regional  institutions,  however,  it  posed \nrisks  for  further  regional  institutionalization.  Mercosur  developed  an \ninformal  system  of  \u201cinter-presidentialism\u201d  that  was  not  governed  by \ninstitutional rules. National presidents played a persistent and central \nrole in decision-making and dispute settlement. This system provided \n\u201cample space for political whim, unilateral action and non-observance \nof  agreed-upon  policy  commitments\u201d  (Phillips,  cited  in  Dominguez \n2009). In other words, inter-presidentialism provided a large, politically \ndetermined  escape  clause  from  Mercosur  commitments  at  critical \nmoments.\n\nThe EU pattern of political involvement is strikingly different from \nthat  of  the  Americas.  Political  leadership  has  been  essential  to  the \nlaunch  of  most  initiatives  that  deepened  economic  integration  and \nenhanced  the  authority  of  European  institutions.  During  the  1980s \nand 1990s, bargains struck and commitments made among national \nleaders sealed the Single European Act and Economic and Monetary \nUnion. The European Council, whose members are heads of national \ngovernments, plays a \u201ccentral political leadership role\u201d in the EU, but \nrather than actually deciding issues forwarded to the council, the top \n\n184\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nnational leaders confirm \u201cthe highest level of political commitment\u201d \nfor resolutions reached elsewhere in the EU apparatus (Hix 2005).\n\nUltimately, EU government leaders have exercised authority over EU \ninstitutions through complex formulas for delegating authority to those \ninstitutions, not by circumventing them or setting them aside on an ad \nhoc basis (the Mercosur model). As delegation to European institutions \nhas increased, the negative effects of high-level political intervention \nhave diminished. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s \u201cempty chair\u201d policy in the 1960s \nwas  far  more  disruptive  than  Margaret  Thatcher\u2019s  Euro-skepticism \ntwo  decades  later  (in  part  because  France  is  a  core  member  of  the \nEEC/EU, while the United Kingdom joined later and has remained less \ncommitted to European integration). In contrast to Latin America and \nother regions, European institutions are intergovernmental, engaging \nsubstantial  segments  of  national  bureaucracies  in  the  processes  of \nintegration. National parliaments have also helped reinforce regional \ncommitments (Martin 2000).\n\nThe  experience  of  Europe  and  other  regions  suggests  that \nsummitry  is  not  enough  to  create  effective  regional  institutions; \ncontinuing  political  intervention  in  the  absence  of  sturdy  institutions \nmay undermine integration. High-level political commitments are an \nessential foundation for regional institution building; the engagement \nof  other  national  political  institutions\u2014such  as  legislatures  and \nbureaucracies\u2014reinforces those commitments by making them fully \nintergovernmental.\n\nLegalization: Obligation, Precision, and Delegation\nOn  the  three  standard  measures  of \nlegalization\u2014precise  and \nbinding  obligations,  and  the  delegation  of  authority  to  third  parties \n(including  regional  institutions)\u2014EU  institutions  are  uniformly  and \nhighly  legalized;  regional  institutions  in  the  Americas  (at  least  the \nsuccessful ones) are legalized on two or more of these dimensions; \nand  regional  institutions  in  Asia,  Africa,  and  the  Middle  East,  with \nthe exception of AFTA, are not highly legalized. Asia has displayed a \nunique attachment to intergovernmental cooperation and an aversion \nto delegating authority to regional institutions. Even Latin America\u2019s \n\u201cparchment institutions\u201d\u2014elaborate on paper, but often ineffective\u2014\nare rare in Asia.\n\nIn  the  Americas  and  other  regions,  regional  institutions  often  lack \neffective  delegated  authority.  Latin  America  has  several  subregional \nagreements  that  have  produced  elaborate  institutional  structures, \namong  them  the  CACM,  Mercosur,  and  the  Andean  Community. \n\n185\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nToo often, however, parties to those agreements have failed to ratify and \nimplement the institutional arrangements (Dominguez 2009). Even when \nimplemented, regional institutions can be ignored. For example, while \nsome  regional  courts  have  substantial  delegated  authority,  they  have \nrarely been used in disputes between member states in Latin America \nor elsewhere (Voeten 2009). Mercosur\u2019s dispute settlement institutions \nhave  seldom  been  deployed;  instead,  as  in  Asia,  member  states  have \ntypically taken trade disputes with their regional partners to the WTO.\n\nThe Americas also demonstrate the ways in which one or more \ndimensions  of  legalization  can  substitute  for  others.  Rather  than \nelaborate regional institutions with supranational authority, the other \ndimensions  of  legalization\u2014the  precision  of  commitments  and  their \nlegally binding character\u2014have been more important to the success \nof regional economic integration in the Americas.\n\nPrecise and binding obligations in regional economic agreements \nhave  been  effective  in  the  Americas\u2014and  their  \u201cratchet  effect\u201d \nhas  been  particularly  significant:  they  have  locked  in  liberalization \ncommitments  and  prevented  backsliding  by  national  governments. \nDespite  an  absence  of  delegation  to  regional  institutions,  NAFTA\u2019s \ncommitments have, by and large, been met by member states (Abbott \n2001). Likewise, Mercosur\u2019s Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n succeeded because of a \nkey innovation: a tariff phase-out program based on carefully designed \nand detailed liberalization schedules that were \u201ceasily calculable and \ntransparent\u201d  (Dominguez  2009).  If  initial  negotiations  for  a  regional \nagreement  achieve  relatively  complete  contracts  and  limit  escape \nclauses, it is more likely to produce substantial liberalization. A close \nparallel occurred in the early years of the EEC: the Dutch government \ninsisted  on  \u201clocking  in\u201d  the  trade  liberalization  timetable,  achieving \nprecision in both the obligations undertaken and their implementation \n(O\u2019Rourke 2009).\n\nThe  world  is  littered  with  elaborate  regional  institutions  that \npossess authority on paper but not in practice. In many cases, either \nmember  governments  have  not  activated  that  authority  or  national \npoliticians  have  overridden  it  at  critical  moments.  Outside  Europe, \nlegalization has mainly had an impact through the precise and binding \nnature  of  commitments  to  regional  partners,  rather  than  through \nregional institutions with substantial delegated authority.\n\nEnfranchising Nongovernmental Actors\nRegional  institutions  have  adopted  a  variety  of  rules  governing \nenfranchisement\u2014that  is,  defining  the  actors  that  can  participate  in \n\n186\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nthem.  EU  institutions  are  unusual  in  offering  multiple  channels  for \ncitizens and corporations to influence regional institutions directly, with \nelections to the European Parliament as well as access to the European \nCourt of Justice (ECJ) and the European Court of Human Rights. The \npower  of  private  actors  has  been  magnified  by  the  direct  effect  and \nsupremacy of European law and the willingness of national courts to \nrefer  cases  to  the  ECJ  for  interpretation.  Even  though  opponents  of \nintegration can also use the judicial system and the ECJ, European law \nbecame a valuable asset for the \u201ccompliance constituencies\u201d within \nnational political debates (Kahler 2001a; Dai 2007). In a more limited \nfashion, NAFTA and the Andean Community also provide for nonstate \nactors to access regional dispute settlement mechanisms and courts. \nIn  Asia  and  the  Middle  East,  a  uniformly  intergovernmental  model \nof  regionalism  allows  no  direct  enfranchisement  of  nonstate  actors. \nCommitment  mechanisms  in  these  regional  institutions  are  based \nwholly  on  governments,  without  direct  support  from  constituencies \nwithin member societies.\n\nMembership Rules\nOf  the  two  models  of  membership,  clubs  and  convoys,  Asia  is \nunusual  in  adopting  only  convoy  membership  practices\u2014inclusive \ninstitutions  open  to  a  large  membership  with  few  hurdles  before \nentry\u2014in contrast to the club model represented by the EU, in which \ndemanding  and  intrusive  changes  in  member  states\u2019  policies  are \nrequired before accession. European institutions\u2019 success in furthering \neconomic  integration  was  in  part  due  to  their  initial  membership  of \nlarge economies (notably France and Germany) at the core of Europe. \nThese influential early members wished to move regional cooperation \nforward  (Wyplosz  2006).  The  domino  effect  and  the  openness  of  its \nmembership to those that accepted existing EEC policies were critical \nto  the  EEC\u2019s  success  in  its  competition  with  EFTA.  The  benefits  of \nmembership, even on these demanding terms, clearly outweighed the \npolitical costs of accession. As integration proceeded and membership \nrequirements  accumulated,  however,  Europe  has  been  forced  to \naccept  some  \u00e0  la  carte  integration  with  the  Schengen  Agreement \non  the  free  movement  of  people  and  the  adoption  of  the  common \nregional currency, the euro.\n\nIn  other  regions,  restrictive  membership  criteria  apply,  although \nnone is as demanding as the EU\u2019s acquis communautaire (the body \nof existing EU rules that prospective members must accept). In Latin \nAmerica,  for  example,  the  membership  criterion  of  democracy  was \n\n187\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nseldom enforced during the early years of the OAS. With the adoption \nof  the  Santiago  Commitment  to  Democracy  in  1991,  however,  this \ncriterion hardened, and it began to affect collective action during the \n1990s.  In  addition,  the  democracy  standard  diffused  to  subregional \norganizations  and  initiatives,  such  as  Mercosur  (1997)  and  the \nproposed  FTAA.  In  this  case,  a  longstanding  membership  norm \nbecame operational and effective as political circumstances changed.\nAs the Latin American example indicates, when an organization \n(or region) has adopted inclusive membership practices (the convoy \nmodel),  shifting  to  more  restrictive  membership  rules  (the  club \nmodel)  is  difficult  but  not  impossible.  Doing  so  enables  members \nthat  are  \u201ccooperators\u201d  on  particular  issues  to  move  forward,  even \nwhen preference outliers are reluctant to participate. The creation of \ndifferent membership categories can ease this transition. Mechanisms \nthat  allow  a  shift  in  membership  models  include  creating  selective \nmembership  incentives  (through,  or  in  addition  to,  the  benefits  of \nintegration) that are only available to \u201ccooperators;\u201d allowing for multi-\nspeed  membership;  creating  a  \u201cvariable  geometry\u201d  within  a  single \norganization;  and  designing  layers  of  multiple  and  complementary \ninstitutions (Kelley 2009; Pevehouse 2009). These membership changes \ncreate additional instruments that can be deployed by members (or a \ngroup  of  members)  to  shift  others\u2019  behavior  and  move  the  regional \ninstitution and its policies in a pro-integration direction.\n\nAs  Asia  contemplates  a  new  regional  architecture,  the  scale  of \nthe region, its heterogeneity, and the complexity of its economic ties \nsuggest  that  skillfully  designed  membership  rules  will  be  essential \nif  regional  institutions  are  to  be  effective.  Achieving  the  right  mix  of \n\u201ccooperators,\u201d organized in club-like arrangements, and wider, more \ninclusive convoys for those less integrated or less committed to policy \nchange  will  be  a  major  challenge  in  the  next  phase  of  designing  a \nregional architecture.\n\n5.4. Institutional Effectiveness\n\nGauging the effectiveness of such a diverse array of regional institutions \nis a daunting task, and one with tentative results at best. As outlined in \nChapter  3,  measuring  such  effects  requires  confidence  in  evaluating \na counterfactual: the trajectory of national policies in the absence of \nregional institutions. The task is complicated further by the unevenness \nof institutional effects: success in some domains will not be matched \nin others. For example, Europe\u2019s liberalization of trade in services has \n\n188\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nlagged, despite the creation of a single market; and the effectiveness of \nits regional policies and the global effects of its Common Agricultural \nPolicy remain controversial (Wyplosz 2006).\n\nGiven the relatively small sample of regional institutions devoted to \npromoting economic integration (at least according to their mandates), \nany  estimate  of  their  effectiveness  will  be  imperfect.  Associating \nparticular  institutional  features  with  effectiveness  will  be  even  more \ntentative. Many regions display wide gaps between the signing and the \nratification of regional agreements, as well as significant shortfalls in \nimplementation after ratification (Dominguez 2007).\n\nRegional institutions typically follow rather than produce the initial \nwave of economic liberalization and trade expansion. In other words, \nan  initial  move  of  unilateral  (or  reciprocal)  liberalization  produces \nopportunities that private actors can  exploit, as well as  demands for \nconsolidating  and  extending  those  gains.  As  the  Asian  experience \ndemonstrates, this model of trade expansion can persist for some time \nwithout the creation of robust regional institutions.\n\nAfter  their  creation,  the  experience  of  Europe  and  the  Americas \nsuggests  that  effective  regional  institutions  can  have  two  significant \neffects. First, they can lock in gains from both earlier liberalization and \nnegotiated  commitments,  and  prevent  backsliding  when  economic \nor  political  conditions  worsen:  the  ratchet  effect.  In  the  course  of \nEuropean institution building, successive rounds of pooling sovereignty \nand  delegating  authority  to  regional \nincreased  the \ncredibility  of  national  commitments  to  future  integration  (Moravcsik \n1998).  Mercosur\u2019s  relatively  weak  institutions  helped  prevent  an \noverturning  of  liberalized  trade  among  its  members,  even  during \nsuccessive economic crises in the late 1990s and 2000s. NAFTA helped \nto consolidate economic liberalization in Mexico during and after the \npeso crisis of 1994/95. Regional institutions in the Americas have been \nless  effective,  however,  when  they  have  attempted  to  promote  an \neconomic agenda beyond trade liberalization (Dominguez 2009).\n\ninstitutions \n\nRegional  institutions  have  also  shifted  national  policies  toward \nones  that  promote  regional  integration.  NAFTA  imposed  important \nadjustments  on  Mexico\u2019s  legal  and  administrative  systems  and \ncontributed to its democratization. European institutions, particularly \nthe EU\u2019s membership conditionality, speeded the transformation and \nconsolidation of domestic political and economic institutions in Eastern \nEurope  after  1989  (Kelley  2004,  2009).  In  assessing  the  influence  of \nregional  institutions  on  corruption,  Pevehouse  (2009)  reiterates  the \nimportance  of  membership  incentives,  noting  that  a  combination  of \ntransferring best practices and offering selective incentives through a \n\n189\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nclub model of membership is likely to be most effective in changing \nnational policies.\n\nFor contemporary Asia, perhaps the most important link between \ninstitutional design and effectiveness concerns the agenda of deeper \nintegration\u2014dealing with barriers to exchange that lie behind national \nborders  and  are  often  deeply  embedded  in  domestic  politics  and \npolicy. In all regions apart from Europe, unilateral national decisions to \nreduce trade barriers or commitments undertaken at GATT/WTO have \nbeen more important than regional institutions in expanding regional \ntrade  volumes.  If  regions  wish  to  move  beyond  the  elimination  of \nbarriers  to  exchange  at  the  border,  however,  are  more  substantial \nregional institutions with effective delegated authority required?\n\nFrom  the  very  limited  array  of  regional  institutions  that  have \npursued  an  effective  deeper  integration  agenda,  several  paths  to \neffectiveness  are  apparent.  European  analysts  agree  that  deeper \nintegration  required  greater  delegation  to  supranational  institutions, \neven though the EU\u2019s particular institutional model may not be optimal \nfor  other  regions  (Baldwin  2009;  Hix  2009;  Wyplosz  2006).  Without \nthe EEC\u2019s institutions, Europe might well have remained a large and \nsuccessful free trade area, despite its founders\u2019 commitment to \u201cever \ncloser union.\u201d Box 5.5 explains in greater detail how Europe balances \ndelegation with national sovereignty.\n\nNAFTA,  with  its  small  but  heterogeneous  membership,  is  more \nsimilar  to  regional  arrangements  in  Asia  and  other  developing \nregions.  Its  more  extensive  integration  agenda  did  include  some \ndelegation  to  third-party  adjudicators,  but  its  alternative  to  EU-style \nsupranationalism was reliance on the precision and binding character \nof  the  NAFTA  agreement.  Australia  and  New  Zealand  have  also \npursued  an  ambitious  agenda  of  deeper  economic  integration  since \n1983 through their agreements on Closer Economic Relations.88 They \nhave  done  so  without  building  substantial  bilateral  institutions  to \ngovern their deepening interdependence. Rather than being a model \nfor  other  economic  partners,  exceptional  circumstances  appear  to \nexplain  the  absence  of  institutionalization:  bilateral  trade  was  not  a \ndominant share of either partner\u2019s external commerce, reducing their \n\n88  Closer Economic Relations (CER) replaced an existing free trade agreement between \nAustralia and New Zealand. In its first phase, CER aimed to achieve free trade in goods \nand services. After a 1988 review, when that agenda was substantially complete, the two \npartners embarked on a deeper integration agenda, which included harmonization of \nbusiness law and regulatory practices, customs procedures, government purchasing, and \ntechnical barriers to trade. \n\n190\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nBox 5.5. how Europe Balances Delegation with National Sovereignty\n\nEuropean  Union  (EU)  governments  have \n\ndelegated specific powers to the European \nCommission (EC) and the European Court \nof Justice (ECJ) to promote the integration of EU \nmarkets.  The  EC  has  been  granted  the  power \nto  propose  EU  legislation,  and  both  it  and  the \nECJ  are  charged  with  enforcing  EU  treaties  and \nsecondary acts. This delegation of powers in the \nmid-1980s helped Europe create a single market \nby  the  end  of  1992.  Delegating  agenda-setting \nto the EC enabled EU states to overcome policy \ngridlock; delegating legal enforcement to the EC \n(which takes cases to the ECJ) enabled member \nstates  to  commit  to  implementing  economic \nintegration deals. At the same time, EU institutions \nhave been carefully designed to limit any threats \nto national sovereignty that might result from this \ndelegation.\n\nFirst  and  foremost,  the  initial  decision  to \ndelegate  requires  the  unanimous  consent  of \nheads  of  state  and  government.  Giving  the  EU  a \nnew  policy  competence  or  changing  decision-\nmaking  in  a  policy  area  from  unanimity  among \nmember governments to majority voting requires \nan  amendment  of  the  EU  treaty,  which  in  turn \nrequires unanimous agreement among EU heads \nof state and government and national ratification \nby  parliamentary  vote,  referendum,  or  both.  This \nis  a  very  high  threshold  for  delegating  any  new \npowers to the EC.\n\nthat \n\nSecond,  the  rules  governing  the  selection  of \nthe EC ensure that the preferences of the executive \nare  close  to  those  of  member  governments.  The \nEC  president  is  chosen  by  consensus  among  EU \nheads of state and government, and must receive \nthe majority support of the European Parliament. \nThis  ensures \nthe  EC  president  shares \ngovernments\u2019  vision  for  the  EU  and  commands \nbroad  national  and  political  support.  In  addition, \neach  EU  state  appoints  a  commissioner,  so  that \nthe  preferences  of  each  member  government \nare represented inside the EC. In effect, the EC is \nboth  an  intergovernmental  body  (in  terms  of  its \nrepresentation structure) and a supranational one \n(in terms of its role and powers).\n\nThird,  high  decision-making  thresholds  and \nmultiple  checks  and  balances  on  the  adoption \nof  the  EC\u2019s  legislative  proposals  ensure  that  all \nEU policy outcomes are highly consensual. Under \nthe  main  legislative  procedure  for  regulating \nthe  single  market  (known  as  the  \u201cco-decision \nprocedure\u201d),  the  EC\u2019s  legislative  proposals  need \nto  muster  a  simple  majority  inside  the  EC,  a \nqualified  majority  among  government  ministers \nin  the  Council  of  Europe  (although  in  practice \ndecisions  tend  to  be  highly  consensual),  and  a \nsimple majority in the European Parliament. Thus \nEC  proposals  cannot  be  adopted  without  the \nsupport of a broad coalition of both governments \nand political parties.\n\nmutual vulnerability; they share a high degree of political transparency \nand have similar domestic institutions; and national preferences were \nclearly aligned in favor of liberalization (Kahler 1995).\n\nTwo  additional \n\nthe  relationship  between \ninstitutional design and the effectiveness of institutions at promoting \neconomic integration.\n\nfindings  qualify \n\n191\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFirst,  institutional  complexity  in  itself  does  not  promote  national \npolicy  change  or  regional  economic  integration.  The  \u201cmassive \ninstitutional superstructure\u201d of the LAS seems to have had little effect \non  regional  relations  or  economic  integration  in  the  Middle  East \n(Solingen 2009). The redesign of the Andean Community in the 1990s \nhad \u201clittle incremental impact on trade integration and accomplished \nlittle else in other economic or political respects\u201d (Dominguez 2009).\n\nSecond, niche institutions with specific functions have often been \nmore effective than region-wide institutional panoplies. For example, \nthe  Andean  Court  played  a  significant  role  in  the  development  of \nintellectual property law (Voeten 2009). Two institutions that provided \nrisk  pooling \nfor  different  purposes\u2014the  Andean  Development \nCorporation (CAF) and Latin American Reserves Fund (FLAR)\u2014were \nuseful adjuncts to other more important conduits of external finance in \nthe Latin American region (Dominguez 2009).\n\n5.5. Feasible Institutions for Asia\n\nA survey of IRIs indicates that Asia is less of an outlier than is often thought. \nAlthough other regions have developed more elaborate institutions, their \ninfluence in spurring the growth of intraregional trade and investment \nhas,  with  few  exceptions,  been  modest.  The  first  question  for  Asia \nis  whether  its  model  of  successful  regional  economic  integration, \nbased  largely  on  unilateral  liberalization  and  WTO  commitments,  has \nbeen  exhausted\u2014and  therefore  whether  new  regional  initiatives  and \ninstitutions are needed. This report answers in the affirmative.\n\nRegional comparisons offer at least partial answers to an equally \nimportant  question:  if  Asia  needs  new  regional  institutions,  what \ndesign  will  be  most  effective  in  deepening  economic  integration \nand  building  a  more  durable  cooperative  framework?  This  raises  a \nprior  question:  is  further  institutionalization  feasible?  Skeptics  often \nargue  that  Asia  is  highly  unlikely  to  build  new  and  more  substantial \nregional institutions because of its heightened attachment to national \nsovereignty. As the current array demonstrates, Asian governments are \nwary  that  strengthened  regional  institutions  would  intrude  into  their \ndomestic political space and policy autonomy. However, the claim that \nsovereignty costs are an insurmountable barrier to regional institution \nbuilding in Asia is incorrect, for three reasons.\n\nFirst, Asia is not unique in prizing national sovereignty: governments \nin all regions display both a strong concern for their sovereignty and a \n\n192\n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nreluctance to grant authority to regional institutions. Although Europe \nhas  gone  further  than  other  regions  in  using  pooled  sovereignty  and \ndelegated  authority  as  a  commitment  device,  European  institutions \nare constrained by national governments through an intricate design \nthat combines institutions of representation and those with delegated \nauthority (Hix 2009). In other regions, postcolonial sensitivities about \nsovereignty have hampered regional institutions from their inception. In \nLatin America, the OAS founding principles included the protection of \nnational sovereignty and maintenance of existing (previously colonial) \nborders (Dominguez 2007). Relatively weak regimes in Africa and the \nMiddle East used the OAU and LAS for the same purpose (Herbst 2007; \nBarnett and Solingen 2007).\n\nSecond,  nearly  every  generalization  regarding  Asia,  sovereignty, \nand international institutions is refuted by Asian participation in global \ninstitutions:  Japan\u2019s  support  for  a  strengthened  dispute  settlement \nmechanism at the WTO; the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s negotiation \nof a WTO protocol of accession that imposed stringent requirements \nto  change  domestic  regulations  and  laws;  and  the  willingness  of \nASEAN  member  states  to  turn  to  the  International  Court  of  Justice \nfor the resolution of territorial disputes (while ignoring ASEAN\u2019s own \ndispute settlement mechanism). Asia\u2019s participation record in global \ninstitutions scarcely suggests that Asian governments are unwilling to \ncompromise their sovereignty to achieve wider objectives.\n\nThird,  for  smaller  (and  even  larger)  open  economies  that  are \nintegrated  into  regional  and  global  economies,  sovereignty\u2014defined \nas  effective  control  over  national  policies\u2014has  already  declined \nsharply.  Smaller  European  economies  (and  even  some  larger  ones) \nhave  calculated  that  having  a  voice  in  regional  institutions  will \noften  restore  sovereignty  rather  than  impair  it.  Many  smaller  Asian \nstates  may  also  make  this  calculation\u2014trading  diminished  national \npolicy  autonomy  for  stronger  regional  institutions  over  which  their \ngovernments exercise at least some control.\n\nEven  so,  concerns  over  sovereignty  cannot  be  set  aside  in \ndesigning regional institutions for Asia; they will necessarily shape any \nfeasible institutions. The record of institutional design in other regions \noffers the following guides for institutional innovation in Asia.\n\n\u2022  So  long  as  a  relatively  open  international  environment  and \nheterogeneous  national  preferences  persist,  a  European-style \nleap to regional institutions with substantial delegated authority \nis unlikely: change will be incremental. (A protectionist backlash \nin the US and Europe might prompt a defensive regionalism in \nAsia, however.)\n\n193\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n194\n\n\u2022  Two  conditions \n\nfree \n\nthat  moved  Europe  beyond \n\ntrade \nagreements  may  support \nthe  strengthening  of  regional \ninstitutions in Asia. The first is the advance of industrialization, \nwhich created demand in Europe for regional action to protect \ndomestic  policy  interventions,  notably  social  protection.  The \nsecond is the demand to reduce behind-the-border barriers to \neconomic exchange in order to create a single market.\n\n\u2022  The process of creating new institutions should be transparent, \ngiven  the  openness  of  Asia\u2019s  regional  economy  and  its \nimportance to the global economy.\n\n\u2022  Scale,  divergent  preferences,  and  dependence  on  the  global \neconomy lend support to a two-tiered or multilayered approach \nto regional architecture. A pan-Asian or region-wide institution \ncould  link  nonmember  states  to  institutional  development, \nwhile subregional or functional clusters of \u201ccooperators\u201d with \nmore  closely  aligned  preferences  over  policy  and  institutions \ncould  move  forward  more  quickly.  A  dominant  regional \norganization, such as the EU, is unlikely to emerge given Asia\u2019s \nregional characteristics and the global environment.\n\n\u2022  A \n\nregional \n\ninstitution \n\nlarge-membership \n\nthat  combines \neconomic,  foreign  policy,  and  security  agendas  would  also \npermit programs of political reconciliation and possibly military \nconfidence building that have been instrumental in furthering \nregional economic cooperation elsewhere.\n\n\u2022  The  significance  of  both  global  and  subregional  rules  and \ninstitutions  for  the  Asian  regional  economy  points  to  another \nrole  for  a  peak  Asian  regional  organization:  monitoring  the \ncompatibility  of  subregional  and  bilateral  arrangements  with \nregional and global commitments.\n\n\u2022  Regional  comparisons  and  Asia\u2019s  engagement  with \nglobal  institutions  suggest  that  sovereignty  costs  are  not \ninsurmountable. Concerns over relinquishing policy autonomy \ncan be met through the design of delegation mechanisms and \nadequate representation for national governments.\n\n\u2022  Regional  economic  institutions  have  played  a  useful  role \nin  consolidating  gains  from  liberalization  and  preventing \nbacksliding by national governments. This suggests a possible \nrole  for  institutions  in  codifying  the  unilateral  gains  that  have \nproduced \u201cFactory Asia\u201d (Baldwin 2009).\n\n\u2022  Groups  of  cooperating  governments  that  wish  to  pursue \ndeeper  economic \ninstitutional \nalternatives: increasing the degree of precision and obligation \n\nintegration  have  several \n\n\fAsia in Context: Regional Comparisons \n\nin  cooperative  agreements;  delegating  more  authority  to \nregional or subregional institutions; or using initial membership \nconditions  to  signal  cooperative  commitments.  Successfully \nnetworked institutions could in turn coordinate their agendas \nand actions, producing a layered architecture directed toward \ndeeper  integration,  with  different  subregional  or  issue  groups \nmoving at different speeds.\n\n\u2022  Setting  unique \n\ninstitutional  boundaries  to  Asia  (whether \nASEAN+3,  ASEAN+6,  APEC,  or  some  other  grouping)  is \nneither desirable nor feasible. The boundaries of any particular \ncooperative project, embodied in an institution or institutions, \nwill  be  set  by  membership  criteria  that  should  be  clearly \nstipulated  to  reflect  member  governments\u2019  commitments. \nMembership  rules  should  allow  both  deeper  cooperation \namong  smaller  groups  of  regional  governments  and  the \nwidening of that cooperation to those that wish, over time, to \nenjoy the benefits of intensified economic exchange.\n\n\u2022  Elaborate regional institutions that are not implemented or used \nby  member  states  are  unlikely  to  deepen  regional  economic \ncooperation or integration.\n\nIntegrating  Asia\u2019s  remarkable  economic  success  is  likely  to \ndemand a new institutional architecture to consolidate its gains and \nsupport  both  a  new  agenda  of  deeper  integration  and  the  inclusion \nof  new  economic  partners.  That  architecture  need  not  imitate  any \nother regional model, although Asia can learn from the experience of \nother regions. Given its scale and diversity, Asia\u2019s regional institutions \nare  likely  to  remain  a  complicated  network  that  incorporates \nsubregional  groups  of  cooperating  governments  and  a  region-wide \npeak  organization.  Suggestions  for  a  feasible  and  effective  regional \narchitecture are presented in Chapter 6.\n\n195\n\n\f\fChapter 6\n\nPolicy Options\n\n197\n\n\fChapter 6\n\nPolicy Options\n\nT he case for greater regional cooperation in Asia is broad, \n\ndeep,  and  compelling  (ADB  2008b).  Yet  marshaling \ncollective  efforts  across  this  vast,  diverse  region  is  a \nchallenge.  As  market-led  regional  economic  integration \ndeepens,  greater  policy  cooperation  is  needed  in  trade, \nfinance,  and  macroeconomic  management,  as  well  as  on  social, \nregulatory \nenvironmental,  and \nand  institutional  reforms\u2014such  as  pro-competitive  deregulation, \nimprovements  in  financial  standards,  enhancement  of  governance, \nand stronger social safety nets\u2014are essential for accomplishing these \nobjectives. More effective national institutions and closer cooperation \namong governments in the region would complement each other. \n\nissues.  Domestic \n\ninfrastructure \n\nAsia\u2019s growing importance in the global economy also demands \nmore  ambitious  and  coherent  regional  cooperation.  To  play  a \ngreater  role  in  addressing  global  economic  issues,  the  region  must \nincreasingly  act  together\u2014not  only  out  of  self-interest  but  also  to \nhelp  maintain  global  economic  prosperity.  Asia  has  a  huge  stake  in \nbolstering global economic stability and promoting open international \nmarkets. By pooling its strengths, it can have more influence on global \neconomic institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to Asia\u2019s benefit and that \nof the world. \n\nWhile  Asia\u2019s \n\ninterdependence \n\nis  growing  and  economic \ncooperation  is  intensifying,  the  region\u2019s  great  diversity  and  complex \npolitics  argue  for  flexibility  and  pragmatism  in  the  scope,  speed, \nsequencing,  and  style  of  economic  cooperation.  The  architecture  of \nregional  cooperation  in  Asia  is  multitrack  and  multispeed,  follows  a \nbottom\u2013up approach, and has so far developed relatively light and lean \nregional institutions. While this flexibility is often seen as a weakness\u2014\n\n198\n\n\fnot least because European regionalism is often, mistakenly, taken as \nthe benchmark\u2014it is in fact both a necessary and a desirable feature \nof the Asian model. Asia is not Europe, as emphasized in Chapter 5. \nAsia\u2019s distinctive approach to cooperation typically allows any group of \ncountries, economies, subregions, or territories to join the integration \nprocess and share in its benefits, regardless of its level of development. \nAnd  as  partnerships  strengthen,  they  can  lead  to  deeper  and  wider \ncollaboration. \n\nAsia\u2019s  open,  gradual,  and  flexible  regionalism  ensures  that  its \neconomic  integration  remains  market-friendly  and  responsive  to  the \nregion\u2019s  diverse  economic,  political,  social,  and  cultural  realities.  As \ndetailed  in  Chapter  2,  some  economies  are  much  more  open  and \neconomically  advanced  than  others.  Some  have  a  long  tradition  of \npolitical  stability,  others  have  only  just  emerged  from  conflict.  Some \nare  more  committed  to  regional  cooperation,  others  have  political \nregimes that strictly limit cross-border contact. \n\nSubregional institutions could continue to make the most of the \nregion\u2019s established bottom\u2013up approach, which supports subregional \ncooperation  efforts  as  building  blocks  for  an  eventual  broader  and \nmore unified regional architecture. The Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  has  already  adopted  this  approach  in  its  plan  to \ncreate an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) through the \u201cASEAN-X \nprinciple,\u201d which allows two or more countries to pursue negotiations \nand  agree  to  liberalize  trade  in  services  in  any  sector  or  subsectors, \nwith other countries joining in when they are ready.\n\nThe  region\u2019s  flexibility  and  pragmatism  has  many  advantages.  It \navoids costly and restrictive bureaucracy. It respects countries\u2019 differing \nneeds  and  sensitivities.  And  it  allows  the  region  to  remain  open  to \nnewcomers and to the rest of the world. Regional cooperation is not \nan end in itself\u2014and in many cases a flexible, pragmatic approach can \ndeliver better results than a rigid, one-size-fits-all framework.\n\nBut  following  a  model  based  only  on  flexibility  and  pragmatism \nhas limitations. Governments may be reluctant to make commitments \nto regional institutions that do not generate early tangible outcomes. \nThey are likely to resort to bilateral negotiations if they feel that broader \nregional  cooperation  is  difficult\u2014even  if  the  benefits  from  regional \ninitiatives  are  potentially  greater.  As  a  result,  important  regional \nobjectives are less likely to be realized than in the presence of stronger \ncooperation mechanisms. More effective and efficient institutions for \nregional  integration  (IRIs)  are  increasingly  needed  to  manage  Asia\u2019s \nexpanding challenges and opportunities.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n199\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n6.1. Asia\u2019s Long-Term Vision \n\nThe long-term vision for regional economic integration in Asia and the \nPacific was set out in the Emerging Asian Regionalism study of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  as  \u201ca  strong,  prosperous,  outward-looking \neconomic community, regionally integrated yet connected with global \nmarkets, and with responsibility and influence to match its economic \nimportance\u201d (ADB 2008b). The study described how an Asian economic \ncommunity  would  involve  a  single  regional  market,  connected  by \nintegrated  infrastructure  networks,  where  trade,  investment,  and \npeople could move freely, along with closer economic, monetary, and \nfinancial cooperation and perhaps even, ultimately, a single currency. \n\nThe  creation  of  such  an  economic  community  requires  Asia  to \nevolve  toward  a  new  regional  architecture  made  up  of  stronger  IRIs \nwith  greater  powers  delegated  from  their  member  countries  and \ncloser  links  with  each  other.  While  an  Asian  economic  community \ncannot\u2014and  should  not\u2014be  achieved  overnight,  it  is  a  long-term \ngoal which can inspire and guide leaders and policy-makers as they \ncraft  responses  to  the  region\u2019s  short-  and  medium-term  needs  and \nchallenges.\n\nThe  Emerging  Asian  Regionalism  study  (ADB  2008b)  set  out  the \nrationale for strengthening regional cooperation toward the creation of \nan Asian economic community in the long run as follows:\n \n\n\u2022  managing  spillovers  among  economies  resulting  from  closer \nmacroeconomic relations, greater capital and labor flows, and \nenvironmental degradation; \n\n\u2022  liberalizing trade and investment flows beyond levels achievable \n\nthrough global and bilateral negotiations; \n\n\u2022  developing regional infrastructure to strengthen transport and \n\nenergy connectivity within and across Asia\u2019s subregions;\n\n\u2022  finding common solutions to cross-border challenges, such as \nimplementing mechanisms to head off epidemics, mobilizing \nresources \nintroducing \nregulations  to  enable  countries  to  integrate  financial,  goods, \nand services markets; \n\nfinancial  crises,  and \n\nto  address \n\n\u2022  exercising greater Asian influence in global economic forums \n\nto help sustain open and competitive global markets; and\n\n\u2022  adding value to national policy-making by sharing experiences \nand  best  practices  as  well  as  exerting  peer  pressure  among \nregional members\u2014including highlighting priorities that may be \nopposed  by  domestic  special  interests,  introducing  measures \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n200\n\n\fto  enhance  competition  and  regulatory  oversight,  adopting \npolicies  to  reduce  poverty  and  inequality,  and  controlling \nenvironmental externalities.\n\nAs  Chapter  2  explained,  Asia\u2019s  economic  cooperation  and \nintegration  has  emerged  over  the  past  few  decades  through  the \ncreation  of  production  networks,  initiatives  to  ensure  financial \nstability  and  the  deepening  and  widening  of  financial  markets,  the \ndevelopment of regional infrastructure, and the provision of regional \npublic goods. Following these developments, the agenda for collective \naction in Table 6.1 sets out priorities and policy solutions that are steps \ntoward the creation of an Asian economic community. \n\nWith  such  a  vision  in  mind,  accomplishing  an  Asian  economic \n\ncommunity would imply:\n \n\nservices; \n\n\u2022  an integrated market free of restrictions on flows of goods and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  deeper and more liquid financial markets open to cross-border \nfinancial  flows,  with  high  standards  of  oversight  and  strong \nprotection for national and foreign investors; \n\n\u2022  effective  frameworks  for  coordinating  macroeconomic  and \nexchange-rate  policies,  taking  into  account  global  challenges \nand differing national circumstances; \n\n\u2022  regional  forums  and  dialogues  to  address  vital  social  issues, \nsuch as poverty, exclusion, income insecurity, migration, aging, \nhealth, and environmental threats; and\n\n\u2022  a consistent voice to project regional concerns in global policy \n\nforums and enhance responsible global governance. \n\nMaking the vision of a region-wide economic community a reality \nwill require countries in Asia and the Pacific to strengthen their IRIs, \nmaking  them  more  effective  institutions,  adequately  staffed,  and \nable  to  provide  first-rate  analytical  and  logistical  support.  Stronger \ninstitutions are needed to complement the market-driven integration \nthat Asia has experienced so far. As set out in Chapter 1, they are key \nto cementing past gains (notably the development of regional supply \nchains  and  production  networks,  and    expansion  of  intraregional \ncooperation),  further  deepening  the  integration  process  (notably \nby  moving  from  commodity  market  integration  to  financial  market \nintegration and macroeconomic policy coordination), and broadening \nregional integration (building links between South Asia and East Asia \nas  well  as  with  other  subregions,  and  incorporating  economies  that \nhave so far been excluded from the process, notably some of Asia\u2019s \nrelatively low-income economies).\n\nPolicy Options\n\n201\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nTable 6.1.

Preceding chapters, \nnotably  the  inventory  of  IRIs  in  Chapter  4  and  the  comparisons  in \nChapter  5,  point  to  the  following  observations  as  guidelines  for \ninstitution building.\n \n\n(i)  Asia\u2019s approach to regional integration is pragmatic and flexible, \nresulting in a multitrack and multispeed process. It has adapted \nits cooperative structures to the varied priorities of Asia\u2019s diverse \neconomies  and  subgroups  thereof.  Regional  cooperation  and \nintegration in Asia have tended to follow a bottom\u2013up approach \nthat supports subregional cooperation efforts as building blocks \nfor an eventual broader and more unified regional architecture.\n(ii)  Asia  possesses  a  dense  web  of  IRIs:  our  stocktaking  exercise \nlists 40\u2014overarching, functional, and facilitating; covering part \nor all of its five subregions, Asia and the Pacific as a whole, or \nlinking Asia with other regions of the world.\n\n \n\n  (iii)  Any  attempt  to  create  an  institutional  architecture  capable  of \nmeeting  the  challenges  of  Asian  integration  must  start  from \nthose existing IRIs that are firmly established. As the survey of \nAsian opinion leaders for this study shows, there is in general \nmore support for strengthening the region\u2019s existing IRIs than \nfor creating new ones, especially at the subregional level. \n  (iv)  Most  of  Asia\u2019s  IRIs  are  intergovernmental  in  structure,  take \ndecisions  by  consensus,  and  involve  the  delegation  of  only \nlimited  powers  to  independent  secretariats  and  other  extra-\nis,  however,  evidence  that \ngovernmental  bodies.  There \ngovernments  are  willing  to  embrace  different  institutional \narrangements when they realize that the advantages of doing so \nare great. Some IRIs, such as ASEAN, have expressed interest in \nbuilding  stronger  secretariats  to  which  member  governments \nmay be prepared to delegate more effective authority to handle \nsome aspects of common regional policies; others are moving \ntoward  making  decisions  through  qualified  majority  voting  as \nwell as by consensus, as in the case of the Chiang Mai Initiative \nMultilateralisation (CMIM). \n\n \n\n(v)  Asia\u2019s  distinctive  institutional  architecture  reflects  its  political, \neconomic,  and  social  characteristics.  It  is  thus  less  likely  to \nadopt  a  European-style  approach  with  strong  supranational \ninstitutions. The pronounced diversity of Asia\u2019s economies and \nsocieties represents a major challenge for institution building. \nMoreover, Asian countries that were created only a few decades \nago following a period of colonization understandably tend to \n\nPolicy Options\n\n203\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\ngive regional issues a much lower priority than building national \nidentity and domestic institutions.\n\n  (vi)  Regional  and  global  integration  are  not  alternatives.  Asia\u2019s \neconomies  are  continuing  to  integrate  globally  as  well  as \nregionally. Asia\u2019s regional architecture should remain compatible \nwith global integration and a strengthening of global governance. \nUnfortunately,  Asian  countries\u2019  obligations  to  regional  and \nglobal institutions are not always implemented and interpreted \nuniformly  across  the  region.  Asia\u2019s  exceptional  economic  and \npolitical diversity makes for enormous variation in governments\u2019 \ncapacity to bring national practice in line with those obligations. \n  (vii)  While Asian integration has been heavily driven by economic \nlogic,  there  is  also  a  broad  preference  in  the  region  for \ndeepening political and security cooperation and elaborating its \ncorresponding  institutional  architecture.  A  large-membership \nregional  institution  that  combines  economic,  foreign  policy, \nand security agendas would also permit programs of political \nreconciliation  and  possibly  military  confidence  building  that \nhave  been  instrumental  in  furthering  regional  economic \ncooperation elsewhere.\n\n6.2. Principles for Reform\n\nTo  reform  Asia\u2019s  IRIs  the  region\u2019s  policy-makers  will  have  to  tackle \nimportant issues related to national sovereignty and the extent of power \ndelegated to regional IRIs, the role played by secretariats (where they \nexist), membership and compliance rules, decision-making principles, \nstakeholders\u2019 participation, and the institutional linkages among Asia\u2019s \nIRIs  and  between  regional  and  global  institutions.  These  issues  are \ndiscussed in the recommendations for reform that follow. But before \ndiscussing  specific  recommendations  it  is  important  to  emphasize \ntwo general principles that can guide efforts and shape strategies for \nstrengthening Asia\u2019s IRIs: openness and transparency. \n\nOpenness.  Asia\u2019s  idea  of  \u201copen  regionalism,\u201d  which  does  not \ndiscriminate against non-members (Garnaut 1996), suggests that Asia\u2019s \nIRIs  ought  to  make  the  most  of  global  institutions  and  conventions. \nThese provide a basis for liberalizing and harmonizing arrangements\u2014\nboth at and behind the border\u2014where there is no strong presumption \nthat  regional  ones  should  differ  from  those  in  the  rest  of  the  world. \nThis  is  an  effective  way  of  ensuring  that  measures  to  cement  Asian \nintegration  also  foster  the  region\u2019s  links  with  the  global  economy. \n\n204\n\n\fAt the same time, there needs to be a more efficient division of labor \nbetween  global  and  regional  institutions  in  areas  where  Asia  has \nspecific needs and circumstances.\n\nThese points can be illustrated with reference to the 1980 United \nNations  (UN)  Convention  on  Contracts  for  the  International  Sale  of \nGoods (CISG), which specifies the principles of sales law that should \nbe  incorporated  into  national  law  and  provide  the  basis  for  court  or \narbitration decisions in the event of disputes. It applies to any contract \nbetween two parties whose governments have ratified the convention, \nunless  it  expressly  states  otherwise.  The  resulting  legal  uniformity \nsimplifies  cross-border  business  and  reduces  uncertainty  about  the \nenforcement of contracts, while governments do not have to start from \nscratch  in  defining  a  basis  on  which  to  harmonize  contract  law.  So \nfar, however, the only Asian countries that have ratified the CISG are \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of Korea, Japan, \nSingapore,  Australia, and  a  handful  of  Central  Asian  nations.  If  more \nAsian governments did so, this would encourage trade and economic \nintegration both within the region and with the rest of the world. \n\nto \n\ninternationally \n\ntravel  contracts  and \n\nWhat is true of the CISG also applies to a variety of other global \nconventions.  The  International  Institute  for  the  Unification  of  Private \nLaw  has  drawn  up  12  conventions  designed  to  standardize  legal \npractice  on  everything  from  financial  leasing  and  international \nfactoring \nintermediated \nsecurities.89 However, only a few Asian countries have signed any of \nthese  conventions.  The  UN  Commission  on  International  Trade  Law \nhas endorsed conventions on letters of credit (documentary credits), \ncontracts for the international carriage of goods by sea, cross-border \ninsolvency,  and  other  commercial  matters.90  Again,  only  a  small \nnumber  of  Asian  countries  have  signed.  The  Hague  Conference  on \nPrivate International Law has promulgated conventions on contracts, \ntorts  (such  as  product  liability  and  traffic  accidents),  and  securities \nheld  with  intermediaries,  as  well  as  on  trusts  and  the  recognition  of \ncompanies, none of which has yet been adopted by Asian countries.91\n\n89  www.unidroit.org/English/conventions/c-main.htm\n90  www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts.html\n91  www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=text.display&tid=10#commerceH. Asian countries can \n\nadopt such conventions unilaterally. There are compelling arguments for why this is in their \ninterest. The question therefore is why more have not yet done so. It could be that, given \neven limited costs of changing legal provisions, there is a coordination problem. Individual \nAsian countries may be reluctant to move before other Asian countries with which they \ndo extensive business. Or it could be that costs of bringing domestic law and practice into \nconformity are nontrivial for countries with relatively limited institutional capacity. Both \nexplanations point to a role for regional facilitating bodies, such as ADB or the UN Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), in providing technical assistance \nand for country groupings such as ASEAN or ASEAN+3 in coordinating the response.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n205\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nTable 6.2.

ASEAN+3 (the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea) \ncountries  recognized  the  IMF\u2019s  experience  in  structuring  emergency \nfinancial  assistance  and  conditionality  when  developing  the  CMIM. \nUnder  its  provisions,  countries  are  required  to  enter  into  a  program \nwith the IMF in order to draw more than 20% of their CMIM quota. \n\nIn  future,  regional  organizations\u2014alongside  the  IMF\u2014could  act \nas \u201cfirst responders\u201d in the case of regional threats. This could avert \nthe criticism that the IMF reacts too slowly because it represents the \ninterests of countries outside the region, and it could better internalize \nspillovers  among  closely  linked  economies.  The  IMF\u2019s  European \nprograms  implemented  in  2008\u20132010  to  address  the  financial  crises \nin  Iceland,  Hungary,  Latvia,  Greece,  and  other  countries  represent \nearly  examples  of  this  kind  of  innovation.  The  negotiations  with  the \ncrisis  countries  included  major  European  stakeholders,  notably  the \nEuropean  Union  (EU)  and  the  European  Central  Bank  (and  Nordic \n\n206\n\n\fgovernments  in  the  case  of  Latvia).  These  stakeholders  contributed \nroughly  as  much  funding  as  the  IMF.  The  newly  created  European \nFinancial  Stability  Facility  designed  to  cope  with  the  sovereign  debt \ncrisis in Greece and potentially other euro-zone member countries had \nan even larger regional component: euro-zone countries contributed \n\u20ac600  billion,  while  the  IMF  contributed  \u20ac150  billion.  Replicating \nthis  pattern  in  other  regions  would  represent  a  major  innovation \nin  flexibility.  In  Asia,  the  CMIM  provides  an  especially  opportune \nfoundation  for  such  complementary  responsibilities.  This  could  also \nallow the emergence of a new model of Asian collaboration with the \nIMF, drawing on Europe\u2019s example.92\n\nIn  the  area  of  development  finance,  the  World  Bank  provides \ntechnical  assistance  and  finance  for  development  projects  not  just \non  a  self-standing  basis  but  also  in  cooperation  with  Asia\u2019s  IRIs.  For \nexample,  senior  managers  from  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  meet \nannually to review their country programs and develop joint initiatives. \nThey  also  issue  joint  reports  to  staff.  Reducing  poverty  and  income \ndisparities  and  boosting  investment  and  growth  in  the  region\u2019s \nslower-growing  economies  are  explicit  goals  of  the  Asian  economic \ncommunity. Where their agendas overlap, ensuring the coherence of \nthe efforts of Asia\u2019s IRIs and global institutions is an essential element \nof shaping a new regional institutional architecture.\n\nIdeally,  global  multilateral  financial  institutions  should  focus \non  global  objectives  and  externalities,  such  as  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals,  climate  change,  food  and  energy  security,  and \nepidemics.  They  could  also  provide  infrastructure  for  development \nfinance,  including  the  collection  and  dissemination  of  knowledge \nand  research  findings.  Regional  development  banks  could  focus  on \nregional  issues  and  externalities,  such  as  infrastructure  connectivity \nand  regional  environmental  protection.  They  could  also  support \nprojects  funded  and  managed  by  the  countries  most  interested  in \nthem.  A  good  example  is  the  creation  of  the  Credit  Guarantee  and \nInvestment  Facility  (CGIF)  as  ADB\u2019s  trust  fund  to  promote  local-\ncurrency bond markets in ASEAN+3 countries (see Chapters 2 and 4). \nSimilar  initiatives  could  support  cooperation  and  integration  among \na selected number of members, although this would imply departing \nfrom current practice requiring a majority of members of (global and \nregional) development banks to approve their activities.\n\nIn  the  area  of  trade  liberalization,  trade  policies  could  be \nharmonized  across  Asia  in  a  manner  that  strengthens  the  region\u2019s \n\n92  Section 6.5 discusses how an Asian Monetary Fund could evolve from the CMIM.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n207\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nintegration  with  the  rest  of  the  world  by  bringing  national  law  and \npractice  into  conformity  with  WTO  protocols\u2014which  cover  trade \nin  goods  and  services,  as  well  as  intellectual  property  rights\u2014a \nstrategy that has worked well previously. The Information Technology \nAgreement  negotiated  after  the  first  WTO  ministerial  has  been \na  successful  basis  for  harmonizing  policy  toward  information \ntechnology  and  elaborating  regional  electronics  supply  chains.  The \nAnnex  on  Basic  Telecommunications  Services  has  facilitated  the \nharmonization and integration of telecommunications infrastructure \nin  the  region.  Several  Asian  economies  have  also  signed  up  to  the \nWTO\u2019s  Government  Procurement  Agreement,  thereby  harmonizing \ntheir  procurement  practices  with  those  of  their  external  trade \npartners.\n\nUnfortunately, the WTO\u2019s Doha Round negotiations have stalled, \nwhile  regional  agreements  continue  to  proliferate.  There  is  no  link \nbetween these tracks, which should ideally coalesce into larger, even \nglobal, agreements. The WTO would have much to offer in crafting and \nadministering  regional  trade  arrangements,  ranging  from  analytical \nservices  to  dispute  resolution.  A  link  between  regional  and  global \nprocesses could address the challenge of making regional free trade \nagreements  (FTAs)  more  multilateral-friendly,  for  example  by  using \nstandard approaches to address vexing issues, such as rules of origin. In \nAsia, wide-ranging discussions are under way concerning the formation \nof  a  region-wide  FTA,  possibly  by  connecting  complex,  overlapping \nFTAs into one simplified agreement, as articulated in Section 6.5. With \nAsian FTAs unified, it would also be easier for regional economies to \nnegotiate transregional FTAs with North America (through Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation\u2014APEC) and Europe (through the Asia-Europe \nMeeting\u2014ASEM),  providing  in  turn  a  path  to  global  trade  integration \n(Kawai and Wignaraja 2010).\n\nIn  the  area  of  financial  stability,  the  finance  sector  assessment \nprograms  that  the  IMF  conducts  jointly  with  the  World  Bank  are  a \nuseful input into the process of strengthening and integrating national \nfinancial  markets.  The  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision \nand  the  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB),  both  of  which  have  Asian \nrepresentation, are the basis for global efforts to set capital adequacy \nstandards for banks, supervise nonbank financial institutions including \nhedge  funds  and  private  equity  funds,  formulate  policies  toward \noffshore financial centers, and generally strengthen the supervision and \nregulation of financial markets. More recently, they have promulgated \nstandards  and  defined  best  practice  for  a  range  of  financial  stability \nissues  highlighted  by  the  2007/08  crisis,  such  as  liquidity  and \n\n208\n\n\fprovisioning  practices.  By  bringing  national  regulation  and  practice \ninto compliance with Basel Committee and FSB standards, supervision \nand regulation within Asia could be harmonized so as to promote the \nintegration of regional financial markets while strengthening their links \nto global ones.\n\nThe  recent  global  financial  crisis  has  highlighted  the  need  for \nan  international  framework  to  monitor,  regulate,  and  supervise \ncross-border  transactions,  including  the  activities  of  systemically \nimportant  financial  firms  and  products.  The  FSB  has  been  tasked \nwith establishing such a framework and coordinating the authorities \ncharged  with  implementing  it.  It  is  also  charged,  in  collaboration \nwith  the  IMF,  with  providing  early  warning  of  macroeconomic  and \nfinancial risks and proposing actions to remedy them. The same issues \nare  being  addressed  in  Europe  by  the  new  European  Systemic  Risk \nBoard,  which  is  mandated  to  oversee  macroprudential  regulation \nand  supervision,  and  by  a  European  system  of  financial  supervisors \nfor  banking,  insurance,  and  securities  markets.  A  structure  similar \nto the European one should be developed in Asia. An important first \nstep would be to create an Asian Financial Stability Dialogue (AFSD), \nas  discussed  in  Section  6.5,  to  promote  financial  stability,  assist  in \nlong-term financial market development, and establish standards for \ngovernance and transparency in the region. Such an institution could \nplay a valuable role by translating FSB initiatives into a regional context \nand then helping to implement them.\n\nTransparency.  The  perception  survey  of  opinion  leaders  in  the \nregion conducted for this study (Appendix 1) suggests that governing \nprinciples  and  decision-making  structures  urgently  need  to  be \nimproved  so  as  to  strengthen  overarching  subregional  institutions \nsuch as ASEAN, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \n(SAARC), and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF).93 \n\nTransparency  is  one  obvious  mechanism  for  enhancing  the \naccountability of Asia\u2019s IRIs and strengthening their governance. While \nsome IRIs have become more transparent, they generally remain the \nonly source of information on their actions, without a proper feedback \nmechanism, making it hard for stakeholders to distinguish aspirations \n\n93  Consider, for instance, this quote from Ong Keng Yong, former ASEAN secretary-general, \nat the ASEAN-European Commission Regional Symposium in November 2005: \u201cWithout \ngiving a voice to the many partners involved in ASEAN\u2019s agenda and priorities and without a \nsystematic and open accounting of the resources and policies needed, ASEAN would not be \nable to achieve the desired outcome of its plans and programs. The rule of law and effective \nregulations are essential to realizing the objectives of the AEC and other goals of ASEAN \ncommunity building. There is an acceptance of such attributes of good governance.\u201d\n\nPolicy Options\n\n209\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\ntheir  operations\u2014would  help.  Global \n\nfrom  achievements.  Establishing  compliance  boards\u2014independent \nentities  composed  of  business  and  academic  members  to  assess \nprogress  in  achieving  the  institutions\u2019  mandates  and  effectively \nimplementing \ninstitutions \nhave  already  moved  in  this  direction.  The  IMF  has  established  the \nIndependent Evaluation Office, staffed in part by outside experts, which \nmakes its reports available to the public.94 The WTO has created the \nTextiles Monitoring Body to monitor implementation of its Agreement \non Textiles and Clothing.\n\nMore  generally,  it  would  be  desirable  to  encourage  greater \nparticipation in Asia\u2019s IRIs by civil society members who support the \ngoals  of  regional  integration.  If  national  governments,  for  whatever \nreason,  chose  to  slow  regional  economic  integration  or  renege  on \ntheir  regional  commitments,  suitably  empowered  private  actors \nwhich would benefit from further integration might then be able to use \nregional  institutions  to  revitalize  the  process,  interpret  agreed  rules, \nand prevent further backsliding, as the EU example shows (Chapter 3). \nAsia\u2019s  IRIs,  from  this  point  of  view,  remain  too  isolated  from  the \nsocieties they serve. \n\nThis can be corrected by institutional reform. In Europe, complaints \nthat  regional  integration  suffered  from  a  \u201cdemocratic  deficit\u201d  led  to \nprovision  in  the  EU\u2019s  2009  Lisbon  Treaty  for  a  new  form  of  public \nparticipation in shaping policy, the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative, which \nenables EU citizens to petition the European Commission (EC) to bring \nforward an initiative of interest to them in an area of EU competence. \nSignatures  must  be  obtained  from  at  least  1  million  citizens  from  a \nsignificant number of member states. \n\nLess  ambitiously,  Asia\u2019s  IRIs  could  convene  outreach  seminars \nso  that  a  broad  range  of  voices  are  heard  before  reaching  policy \ndecisions.  In  Europe,  for  example,  EU  Trade  Commissioner  Karel \nDe  Gucht  has  brought  together  representatives  from,  among  others, \nnongovernmental  organizations,  business  and  industry  associations, \nconsumer groups, trade unions, employers\u2019 organizations, faith-based \ngroups, and research institutes to provide input into an EC proposal for \nregional trade policy reform. Box 6.1 elaborates on how to involve civil \nsociety in Asian IRIs.\n\nAs  well  as  suggesting  that  Asian  regionalism  should  be  open \nand  more  transparent,  this  report  offers  three  sets  of  specific \nrecommendations  for  shaping  a  new  institutional  architecture  in \n\n94  ADB also has an Independent Evaluation Department that conducts an assessment of its \npolicies, strategies, programs, and projects, including their design, implementation, and \nresults (www.adb.org/Evaluation/about/default.asp)\n\n210\n\n\fPolicy Options\n\nBox 6.1.

However,  as  Asia\u2019s  regional \narchitecture  evolves  to  support  the  development \nof  an  Asian  Economic  Community,  grassroots \nCSOs  will  need  to  become  more  involved.  They \ncan  help  make  IRIs\u2019  agendas  and  operations \nmore  responsive  to  society\u2019s  needs  and  ensure \nthey  follow  proper  principles  of  transparency, \ngovernance, and accountability.\n\nAsia  is  now  home  to  a  vibrant  regional  civil \nsociety.  A  diverse  range  of  grassroots  CSOs \noperate  across  borders,  often  through  networks. \nThey  seek  to  respond  to  cross-border  collective \naction  problems  and  make  CSOs\u2019  voices  heard \nby  policy-makers  (Nesadurai  2009).  CSOs  offer \nto \nalternative  governance  models \ntake  more  account  of  neglected  issues  such  as \nthe  environment  or  marginalized  groups  such \nas  workers,  migrant  laborers,  and  indigenous \ncommunities.  They  may  also  supply  better \ninformation  and  knowledge  on  issues  such  as \nHIV/AIDS,  environmental  conservation,  gender, \nand  disaster  relief,  allowing  them  to  work  in \nclose partnership with governments and regional \ninstitutions. \n\ntend \n\nthat \n\nThrough  their  information  and  knowledge-\nbased advocacy CSOs can improve the quality of \nregional  governance.  Institutional  effectiveness \nis  enhanced  if  CSO  activity  helps  institutions \nreview  their  goals,  introduce  new  agenda  items, \nconsider  new  ways  of  addressing  problems, \n\nand  thus  improve  their  governance.  A  plurality \nof  information  and  perspectives  increases  the \nlikelihood  of \nfinding  more  comprehensive\u2014\nand  ultimately  more  politically  and  socially \nsustainable\u2014solutions,  even  if  it  takes  longer  to \nreach  an  informed  decision.  By  engaging  with \ngrassroots  CSOs,  as  they  do  with  the  regional \nbusiness  and  scholarly  networks,  Asia\u2019s  IRIs  can \npool a range of competencies and collaborate on \naddressing shared problems. \n\nAccountability  to  all  key  stakeholders  likely \nto  be  affected  by  an  institution\u2019s  activities  and \nprocesses is also becoming crucial to legitimizing \nits  governance  arrangements.  To  draw  more  on \nCSOs\u2019 contributions, IRIs could provide a regional \n\u201cpublic  sphere\u201d  in  which  institutional  elites  and \na variety of civil society voices could interact and \nengage in public discussion. This could stimulate \ncommunication  among  all  stakeholders  and \nwiden  the  debate,  both  of  which  could  lead  to \ndesirable substantive change. \n\nRegional institutions could also develop more \nformalized,  regular  mechanisms  through  which \nCSOs  could  submit  research  reports,  position \npapers,  and  comments  on  items  on  the  regional \ninstitutional  agenda, \nfor  active  consideration \nduring  official  deliberations  on  policy  matters. \nCreating  a  civil  society  office  within  regional \ninstitutions, as exists at ADB, could help integrate \nCSOs and their inputs into institutional processes, \nand  engage  with  all  stakeholders.  Regional \ninstitutions  could  also  introduce  transparency \nmeasures, mechanisms for internal or independent \nevaluation, and procedures for receiving external \ncomplaints  and  providing  institutional  responses. \nADB\u2019s  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  one \npossible  template,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Inspection \nPanel another.\n\n211\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nAsia and the Pacific conducive to the creation of an Asian economic \ncommunity. \n \n \n\n\u2022  Strengthen and rationalize overarching IRIs. \n\u2022  Develop \n\nto  exploit  compelling \n\ninstitutions \n\nfunctional \n\n \n\n\u2022  Establish  new  pan-Asian  institutions  and  empower  existing \n\nThese  three  recommendations  are  developed  in  the  following \n\nopportunities. \n\nones.\n\nsections.\n\n6.3. Strengthening Overarching \nInstitutions \n\nOverarching IRIs play a key role in the Asian integration process. Both \nsubregional  and  intraregional  institutions  need  to  be  strengthened, \nwhile intraregional ones also need to be rationalized. Four of Asia and \nthe Pacific\u2019s five subregions have an overarching institution that needs \nto become more effective: ASEAN in Southeast Asia, SAARC in South \nAsia,  PIF  in  the  Pacific,  and  the  Trilateral  Summit  (TS)  in  Northeast \nAsia.95 (As discussed in Chapter 4, Central Asia does not yet have an \noverarching  IRI.96)  They  need  to  create  more  effective,  autonomous \nsecretariats,  equipped  with  stronger  agenda-setting  and  surveillance \npowers,  adequate  financial  and  human  resources,  and  clear  legal \nmandates;  establish  clearer  and  more  objective  membership  rules; \ndevelop  enhanced  decision-making  rules;  and  build  stronger  links \nboth with each other and with national agencies in order to promote \ncloser integration among Asia\u2019s subregions. At the intraregional level, \nASEAN+3  and  the  East  Asia  Summit  (EAS)  both  need  to  establish  a \nsecretariat. \n\nStronger secretariats. There have been a number of proposals for \ncreating stronger, more independent secretariats that could help IRIs \nset  their  increasingly  complex  agendas,  issue  forthright  assessments \nof national policy untainted by political considerations, better support \n\n95  Although the TS is newer and less comprehensive than the others, it has recently emerged \n\nas an important IRI and has great potential to strengthen economic cooperation and \n integration among its members, with considerable influence on the wider East Asian region.\n\n96  The Economic Cooperation Organization, Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC), and \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) are not classified as overarching \n subregional IRIs for Central Asia either because they include countries outside the  subregion, \nor because, in the case of CAREC, it is not governed by a summit of political leaders. \n\n212\n\n\fefforts to encourage policy coordination within the region, and monitor \ncountries\u2019 compliance with their integration obligations.\n\nMore ambitiously, stronger secretariats could publish scorecards \nof countries\u2019 compliance with their integration obligations. To provide \nfurther  insulation  from  politics,  such  scoring  could  be  outsourced \nto  an  independent  third  party.  Ratings  would  cover  both  policy \ninputs  (such  as  whether  relevant  legal  and  regulatory  changes  had \nbeen  undertaken  or  budgetary  procedures  had  been  reformed  in \nthe  recommended  manner)  and  policy  outputs  (such  as  whether \nnational  market  prices  had  converged  with  prices  elsewhere  in  the \ngrouping or budget and current account balances had been reduced \nto recommended levels).97\n\nASEAN has recently made progress in this direction. Its secretariat, \nwhich  is  tasked  with  monitoring  and  assessing  the  implementation \nof  the  AEC  Blueprint,  has  developed  a  scorecard  and  conducted \nits  first  assessment  in  May  2009.  However,  the  secretariat  was  not \nauthorized  to  reveal  the  final  scores  to  the  public  and  some  ASEAN \nmembers  questioned  the  usefulness  of  the  secretariat\u2019s  approach, \narguing that it was little more than a checklist of individual members\u2019 \nactions  and  provided  no  guidance  as  to  how  they  should  prioritize \nwhat  still  needs  to  be  done.  Some  ASEAN  members  then  asked \nthe  newly  established  Economic  Research  Institute  for  ASEAN \nand  East  Asia,  an  intergovernmental  policy  think-tank,  to  develop  a \nmore  analytical  approach  to  monitoring  and  assessment.  A  steering \ncommittee composed of the chair of the ASEAN High Level Task Force, \na  representative  of  ASEAN\u2019s  secretariat,  and  the  chair  of  a  network \nof  various  East  Asian  research  institutes  was  formed  to  guide  the \nprocess.98 These are potentially significant steps toward more effective \nsurveillance within ASEAN.\n\nFinancial  resources.  Effective  secretariats  will  need  adequate \nfinancial resources. Two key issues\u2014the size of the secretariat\u2019s budget \n\n97  The procedure might be undertaken annually. A study on ASEAN by McKinsey & \n\nCompany (2004) offers suggestions along these lines. That said, the limitations of existing \nmechanisms for multilateral surveillance provide grounds for caution. IMF surveillance, \nespecially of large countries that do not borrow from the IMF, is not particularly effective. \nGiven that there has been a reluctance to make the IMF\u2019s surveillance more independent \nof its members, it might also be difficult to move toward vigorous independent surveillance \nat the regional level. Even so, there is a clear ongoing attempt to strengthen multilateral \nsurveillance: witness, for example, G20 governments\u2019 commitment at their September \n2009 Pittsburgh summit to empower the IMF to organize peer reviews of big-country \npolicies. There is reason to think that sentiment in Asia will gravitate in the same direction.\n\n98  Some countries initially insisted that all ASEAN members be represented on the steering \n\ncommittee, which suggests that they are still uncomfortable with delegating this task to an \nindependent body.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n213\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nand how it is funded\u2014are linked. In the case of ASEAN, the principle \nof \u201cequal contribution\u201d tightly constrains the secretariat\u2019s finances and \nmakes  it  dependent  on  external  funding,  since  its  budget  is  limited \nto  what  the  smallest  ASEAN  economy  (the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic)  can  afford.  Asia\u2019s  IRIs\u2014especially  overarching,  subregional \nones\u2014would  be  more  effective \nif  member  countries\u2019  budget \ncontributions  were  proportional  to  their  gross  domestic  product,  as  is \nthe case in the EU. While bigger contributors might then demand a larger \nvoting share, decision-making mechanisms can be designed such that \nsmall countries retain an important say. Another option is for individual \nmember countries to fund various secretariat activities directly, as is the \ncase with SAARC centers funded by their different host countries.\n\nHuman  resources.  Effective  secretariats  also  require  a  strong \nanalytical  and  administrative  capacity.  In  particular,  they  need  to  be \nable  to  attract  world-class  professionals  by  offering  a  competitive \nsalary  and  benefits  scheme  and  to  develop  a  regional  agenda  from \nthe  perspective  of  the  IRI  rather  than  that  of  its  member  countries. \nThis  implies  creating  proper  career  positions  in  the  secretariat  that \ngo  beyond,  for  example,  the  typical  three-year  secondments  to  the \nsecretariats of ASEAN, SAARC, and other Asian IRIs.\n\nRegional  opinion  leaders  support  further  movement  in  this \ndirection.  For  example,  two-thirds  of  survey  respondents  think  that \nincreasing the financial and human resources of ASEAN\u2019s secretariat \nis a high priority, as Figure 6.1 shows; and 57% think ASEAN urgently \nneeds  to  create  a  truly  regional  bureaucracy  with  permanent  staff \npositions. A majority (58%) think delegating more powers from national \ninstitutions to ASEAN is a priority \n\nIn  the  case  of  SAARC,  58%  of  respondents  think  increasing  the \nfinancial and human resources of its secretariat is a priority; the figure \nis 46% in the case of PIF (Figure 6.2). Respondents think the top priority \nfor these two IRIs should be improving their governance and decision-\nmaking structures.\n\nLegal  mandate.  IRIs\u2019  secretariats  also  require  a  clear  legal \nmandate  that  defines  their  roles  and  responsibilities  and  those  of \nthe  secretary-general  and  other  key  titleholders,  so  that  everyone \nknows  what  they  can  (and  cannot)  do;  the  stocktaking  exercise \nin Chapter 4 suggests that Asia\u2019s IRIs tend to have either a limited \nand  narrow  mandate  or  none  at  all.  For  example,  the  secretaries-\ngeneral  of  overarching  subregional  IRIs  ought  to  have  the  power \nto represent their institutions in regional and global forums, as the \nEC  president  does.  While  ASEAN\u2019s  secretary-general  and  chair \nwere invited to attend recent G20 meetings, they could not speak \n\n214\n\n\fFigure 6.1.

As discussed in Chapter 5, Asia can learn from other regions\u2019 \nexperience  in  balancing  the  delegation  of  powers  to  IRIs  with \nnational sovereignty. \n\nMembership  and  compliance  rules.  As  well  as  stronger \nsecretariats with a clear legal mandate, Asia\u2019s IRIs need clearly defined \nmembership  and  compliance  rules.  Whereas  the  EU  requires  new \nmembers to have a market economy, be fully democratic, and absorb \nthe  body  of  European  law  into  the  national  legal  system,  ASEAN\u2019s \ngradual  enlargement  from  5  members  to  10  was  not  based  on  any \nstated objective criteria. Political considerations were paramount, as \nthey doubtless will be in determining Timor-Leste\u2019s possible accession. \n\n215\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 6.2.

The question was: \nAssess the most urgent initiatives that are required to strengthen the capability of selected institutions in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nSource: ADB (2010).\n\nSeveral countries have also applied to join the EAS, but it is not clear \nhow their applications will be judged. \n\nCompliance rules ought to ensure predictability by giving members \nincentives to abide by them. Asia\u2019s IRIs ought to introduce sanctions \nfor not complying with their rules, including the threat of expulsion or \nsuspension. Currently they mostly rely on peer pressure; sanctions are \nrare,  creating  uncertainty  and  weakening  institutions\u2019  cohesiveness. \nWhile  ASEAN  has  introduced  a  dispute  settlement  mechanism, \ncountries have so far not used it: they prefer to resolve disputes through \nglobal institutions, notably the WTO, as Chapter 4 explains. \n\nDecision-making. Asia\u2019s IRIs need to supplement their consensus-\nbased  decision-making  rules  with  the  possibility  of  taking  some \n\n\fdecisions  by  qualified  or  simple  majority  voting.  As  the  comparative \nanalysis  in  Chapter  5  highlights,  Asia  is  not  alone  in  prizing  national \nsovereignty\u2014and  an  attachment  to  autonomy  has  not  prevented \ngovernments  in  other  integrating  regions  (or,  indeed,  in  Asia  itself) \nfrom pooling their sovereignty to achieve important goals and moving \nbeyond  consensus  decision-making  when  they  need  to  act  quickly \nand decisively. One example of this is the ASEAN Charter, which was \ndescribed in detail in Box 4.2. \n\nIn the case of ASEAN+3, developing appropriate decision-making \nrules  is  a  crucial  part  of  managing  the  relationships  between  ASEAN \nand the \u201cPlus Three\u201d countries. While growing spillovers among their \neconomies argues for closer cooperation with ASEAN+3, one constraint \non  taking  up  more  issues  is  ASEAN  countries\u2019  worry  that  decision-\nmaking will be disproportionately dominated by the larger \u201cPlus Three\u201d \nmembers.99  ASEAN  members  may  also  be  uncertain  about  whether \nthe large countries are prepared to pursue deep integration. For their \npart, the large countries would presumably resist letting smaller ASEAN \nnations drive the process. They would thus be likely to resist majority \nvoting rules along the lines of \u201cone country, one vote\u201d that might allow \ncoalitions of small countries to dictate decisions. A system of weighted \nvoting,  where  voting  shares  are  related  to  country  size  but  small \ncountries are disproportionately represented, could strike a balance. \n\nThe  CMIM,  where  a  voting  rule  along  these  lines  has  been \nadopted,  suggests  that  this  approach  is  feasible.  Since  providing \nemergency  financial assistance speedily  in  a  crisis is vital, the  CMIM \ncan  disburse  loans  quickly  and  take  other  operational  decisions  by \nqualified  majority  vote,  while  the  consensus  approach  is  still  used \nfor  deciding  on  other  issues  of  a  fundamentally  strategic  nature.100 \nOther  conceivable  approaches  include  supermajority  thresholds  for \ndecision-making  requiring,  for  example,  two-thirds  of  participating \ncountries to agree in order for a proposal to carry, or double majority \nvoting\u2014where a decision must be supported by a specified majority \nof  countries  and  countries  whose  populations  constitute  a  specified \nmajority of the population of the region. \n\nInstitutional  linkages.  IRIs\u2019  effectiveness  also  depends  on  both \ntheir internal linkages with relevant national agencies and stakeholders, \n\n99  This can be thought of as analogous to the process by which discussion of more issues \n\nhas migrated from the G7 to the G20 as spillovers between the G7 countries and emerging \neconomies have grown more pronounced.\n\n100  Operational decisions require a qualified majority of two-thirds of the executive governing \nbody, which comprises deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors of the \n13 ASEAN+3 countries plus the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n217\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nand  their  external  ones  with  other  IRIs  and  global  institutions. \nUnsurprisingly, Asia\u2019s IRIs are shaped by the various ministries, central \nbanks  and  other  agencies  that  establish  and  fund  them\u2014typically \nforeign  ministries  in  the  case  of  subregional  overarching  IRIs  and \nthe  relevant  ministries  in  the  case  of  functional  IRIs.  Often  (but  not \nalways),  though,  their  success  depends  on  the  involvement  of  the \nprime  minister\u2019s  or  president\u2019s  office\u2014and  71%  of  respondents  to \nthe survey of Asia\u2019s opinion leaders conducted for this study believe \nthe prime minister\u2019s or president\u2019s office should be involved in major \nregional cooperation initiatives. At the same time, 70% of respondents \nsuggested creating specific offices in the line ministries involved with \nAsia\u2019s IRIs in order to monitor the progress of cooperation initiatives \nproperly (see Figure 6.3).\n\nFigure 6.3.

The question was: \nRate the importance of the following initiatives which will eventually establish or create institutional linkages to support regional cooperation.\n\nSource: ADB (2010).\n\n218\n\n\fExternal  linkages  are  also  important.  One  useful  reform  would \nbe to establish a dialogue among overarching subregional institutions \nsuch  as  ASEAN,  SAARC,  and  PIF.  Figure  6.3  shows  that  68%  of \nrespondents  believe  that  overarching  subregional  IRIs  should  offer \neach other observer status and 67% believe that the activities of Asia\u2019s \nmajor IRIs should be better coordinated. Functional and overarching \nIRIs  in  each  subregion  should  also  coordinate  their  activities.  For \nexample,  institutions  such  as  the  Brunei  Darussalam-Indonesia-\nMalaysia-Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area  (BIMP-EAGA)  and \nIndonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) may increase \ntheir effectiveness by strengthening their ties with ASEAN\u2019s secretariat.\nIn  addition  to  ASEAN,  major  powers  such  as  India  and  the  PRC \ncould  also  assume  a  pivotal  role  in  linking  Asia\u2019s  IRIs  from  East, \nSouth, and Central Asia through new intergovernmental mechanisms. \nNew approaches might also be needed to draw certain countries or \nprovinces in critical geographical nodes into regional cooperation and \nprovide opportunities for peripheral areas to connect with the centers \nof regional economic growth. \n\nAs  discussed  in  Section  6.2,  Asia\u2019s  IRIs  also  ought  to  strengthen \ntheir  ties  with  global  institutions,  to  capture  synergies,  stress  their \ncomplementary roles, and represent Asia\u2019s interests in global forums \nmore  effectively.  Several  Asian  IRIs  participate,  for  example,  in  G20 \nactivities.  The  Executives\u2019  Meeting  of  East  Asia  Pacific  Central  Banks \n(EMEAP)  and  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI)  contribute  on \ntechnical issues related to financial market regulation, and the secretary-\ngeneral and chair of ASEAN are invited to participate in meetings. While \nsix  countries  from  Asia  and  the  Pacific  are  G20  members\u2014Australia, \nthe  PRC,  India,  Indonesia,  Japan,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2014close \ncoordination among, for example, EAS or SAARC members to identify \nissues to propose for discussion at G20 meetings would allow non-G20 \nAsian countries to have their priorities reflected in global discussions.\n\nGreater  focus.  As  well  as  being  strengthened,  overarching \nintraregional  IRIs  such  as  ASEAN+3  and  the  EAS  need  to  be \nrationalized. Their responsibilities should be clarified, identifying each \ninstitution  with  a  core  competency  and  ensuring  that  these  do  not \noverlap unnecessarily. This is in line with the results of the ADB survey, \nwhich suggest that the activities of ASEAN+3 and the EAS ought to be \nmore focused (Figure 6.4). The survey also suggests that they should \nstrengthen  their  linkages  with  national  agencies  in  their  member \ncountries, create their own secretariats, and widen their membership.\nASEAN+3,  which  was  established  in  response  to  the  1997/98 \nAsian financial crisis, has had a very clear focus on regional financial \n\nPolicy Options\n\n219\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nFigure 6.4.

In recent years, however, it has also moved to cover trade \nand investment, rural development, and poverty eradication, as well as \nthe provision of regional public goods in areas such as natural disaster \nmanagement  and  environmental  protection  (ASEAN+3  Cooperation \nWork Plan 2007\u20132017). The EAS is more political in nature and, given \nits overlap in membership with ASEAN+3, it is struggling to identify a \nspecific focus, although it is doing a lot of work on trade and investment. \nIn line with recent trends, a natural division of labor would be for \nASEAN  to  focus  on  regional  infrastructure  development,  through  the \ncreation  of  an  ASEAN  infrastructure  investment  fund,  ASEAN+3  on \nfinancial  cooperation,  through  initiatives  such  as  the  CMIM,  and  the \nEAS on trade and investment cooperation, with recent discussions on \nforming a regional free trade zone.\n\n\f6.4. Developing Functional Institutions \n\nGroups  of  countries  sometimes  have  particularly  attractive \nopportunities for cooperation that can only be reaped by investing in \nIRIs.  In  some  cases  this  will  entail  subregions  learning  from  and/or  \nreplicating  achievements  and  experiences  elsewhere.  This  is  an \nimportant reason why functional IRIs that promote the development of \ncertain Asian subregions, such as the Central Asian Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC), the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), and the \nSouth  Asian  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  programs, \nwould  benefit  from  strengthening  their  ties.  Functional  institutions \nthat operate in similar areas would also benefit from closer ties and \ncoordination.  For  example,  since  both  EMEAP  and  ABMI  seek  to \npromote  the  development  of  Asia\u2019s  bond  markets,  they  could  share \ntechnical  information  or  grant  each  other  observer  status.  In  other \ncases it will involve building institutions to foster cooperation in entirely \nnew functions and areas.\n\nCountries that cooperate need not be immediate neighbors. For \nexample, EMEAP\u2019s Asian Bond Fund initiative, which seeks to promote \nlocal-currency  bond  markets,  brings  together  a  geographically \ndisparate  subset  of  East  Asian  and  Pacific  economies  whose  central \nbanks are committed to this aim. Often, though, there are opportunities \nfor  cooperation  among  neighboring  countries.  For \ninstance, \nlinking  national  highway  and  rail  systems  or  developing  integrated \ntransnational transport systems promotes market integration.101\n\nIdeally  one  might  work  toward  an  integrated  pan-Asian  system \nof  railways,  roads,  and  navigable  rivers.  But  coordinating  ambitious \nprojects  at  the  regional  level  is  difficult.  The  returns,  meanwhile, \nare likely to be greatest for links between specific, often contiguous, \nprovincial  and  local  economies.  This  is  a  rationale  for  why  a  subset \nof  governments,  typically  in  a  particular  subregion,  might  establish \nspecialized institutions for advancing these projects.\n\nOne example is the Cross-Border Transport Agreement of the GMS. \nThis is a legal instrument, which entered into force at the end of 2003 \nand  provides  for  the  negotiation  of  common  road  and  bridge  design \nstandards, road signs, and signals; ensures the exchange of commercial \ntraffic rights; and establishes requirements that road vehicles must meet \nin order to be eligible for cross-border traffic. It provides for simplified \nvisa application processes for people involved in cross-border transport \n\n101  Two reviews and analyses of the role of infrastructure in facilitating intraregional trade are \n\nFrancois, Manchin, and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2009) and ADB/ADBI (2009). \n\nPolicy Options\n\n221\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\noperations and single-stop/single-window customs inspection. Such a \ncompelling  functional  opportunity  for  cooperation  could  be  usefully \nreplicated in other subregions, such as South Asia.\n\nSubregions  may  also  be  able  to  learn  from  others\u2019  experiences. \nFor  example,  a  transport-sector  strategy  for  the  GMS  was  developed \nin 2005 with technical assistance from ADB and adopted by national \ngovernments the following year. This has enabled the countries of the \nsubregion to coordinate the development of north\u2013south and east\u2013west  \nroad transport corridors and improve inland water navigation and port \nsystems.  These  coordinated  investments  have  fostered  subregional \nintegration and encouraged faster upgrading of national infrastructure, \nsince  the  benefits  of  such  investment  are  greater  in  the  presence  of \ncomplementary  investments  in  adjoining  countries.  In  August  2010, \nwith the support of ADB and other development partners, GMS countries \nendorsed  a  comprehensive  plan  to  improve  regional  infrastructure \nin  order  to  bolster  economic  growth.  The  program  covers  transport, \nenergy,  trade  facilitation,  telecommunications,  human  resources \ndevelopment,  environment  and  natural  resources  management, \ntourism, and agriculture.\n\nAnother  helpful  step  is  the  GMS  Economic  Corridor  Initiative \n(Wu 2010). Establishing an economic corridor\u2014a transborder space, \ntypically  straddling  a  central  transport  artery,  with  the  infrastructure, \nlogistics,  and  policy  support  needed  for  integrated  production\u2014can \nhelp  create  an  efficient  production  platform  and  act  as  a  magnet \nfor  foreign  investment.  Countries  straddling  the  artery  cooperate  in \nharmonizing  infrastructure  and  urban  development,  streamlining \nborder formalities, and otherwise facilitating exchange and integrated \nactivity  within  the  corridor.  In  the  GMS  context,  this  can  be  thought \nof  as  developing  the  ancillary  transport  and  \u201csoft\u201d  infrastructure \nneeded to complement the north\u2013south and east\u2013west road transport \nnetworks on which the Cross-Border Transport Agreement has so far \nconcentrated.  While  still  in  its  early  stages,  progress  is  under  way. \nDrawing  on  experience  in  the  GMS,  similar  agreements  governing \nboth the \u201chardware\u201d and \u201csoftware\u201d of transport infrastructure among \nneighboring countries could be usefully pursued in other parts of Asia. \nOther  promising  areas  for  future  cooperation  include  health, \ndisaster management, and student exchanges. The emerging infectious \ndiseases  program  of  ASEAN+3,  for  example,  aims  to  enhance \nregional  preparedness  and  capacity  through  integrated  approaches \nto prevention, surveillance, and timely responses to new threats such \nas SARS, avian influenza, and a potential pandemic. Similar programs \n\n222\n\n\fexist  under  the  aegis  of  the  EAS.  The  innovative  ASEAN  Agreement \non Disaster Management and Emergency Response, which came into \nforce  at  the  end  of  2009,  requires  signatories  to  identify  disaster  risk \nareas,  establish  early  warning  systems,  draw  up  standard  operating \nprocedures for providing disaster relief, and cooperate on technology \nand  scientific  research.  A  program  detailing  these  activities  for  \n2010\u20132015  is  under  development  with  the  UN  International  Strategy \nfor Disaster Reduction and Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre. Also, \nsince the early 1990s Australia, Japan, and some ASEAN countries have \nparticipated in University Mobility in Asia and the Pacific, which works \nto facilitate student exchanges. ASEAN and ASEM also organize youth, \narts, and cultural exchanges.\n\nFinancial  cooperation  is  a  particularly  important  area.  East  Asia \nis leading the way through ASEAN+3 and EMEAP, and other parts of \nAsia could learn from its experience. In May 2010, ASEAN+3 members \nagreed  to  establish  the  ASEAN+3  Macroeconomic  Research  Office \n(AMRO)  to  conduct  regional  financial  surveillance.  The  next  step \nwould  be  to  endow  AMRO  with  appropriate  financial  and  human \nresources  and  authorize  it  to  prepare  comprehensive  analyses, \nassessments,  and  discussion  papers  to  support  the  operation  of \nthe  CMIM  and  ASEAN+3\u2019s  Economic  Review  and  Policy  Dialogue \n(ERPD).  By  organizing  frank  peer  reviews  of  members\u2019  policies, \nAMRO would strengthen the CMIM, since more effective surveillance \nwould encourage governments to undertake necessary policy reforms \nand  hence  increase  their  partners\u2019  willingness  to  lend.  Moreover,  as \nAsia\u2019s growing economic interdependence increases the importance \nof  maintaining  regional  exchange-rate  stability,  a  basket  of  Asian \ncurrencies  (an  Asian  currency  unit)  could  be  used  as  an  objective \nmetric, as Box 6.2 explains.\n\nAnother important ASEAN+3 initiative is the ABMI. Together with \nindividual national reforms, this has contributed to the growth of local-\ncurrency-denominated bond markets in emerging East Asia. Under the \nABMI,  member  countries  have  announced  the  creation  of  the  CGIF, \nsetting up a group of experts from public and private sector institutions \nto  consider  establishing  a  regional  intermediary  to  enhance  cross-\nborder  settlement  infrastructure  as  well  as  measures  to  harmonize \ncross-border  regulations  and  strengthen  domestic  credit  rating \nmechanisms.  The  CGIF  (see  Chapter  2  for  details)  is  an  important \noutcome of the ABMI that is the result of policy dialogue, coordination, \nand collaboration between ASEAN+3 and ADB over the past five years \non financial cooperation and integration issues.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n223\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nBox 6.2. The Potential Role of an Asian Currency Unit \n\nA s  Asia\u2019s  economies  become  more \n\ninterdependent,  maintaining  a  modicum \nof  exchange-rate  stability  will  become \nincreasingly important. This will be challenging in \nan environment in which recovery from the global \neconomic  and  financial  crisis  of  2008/09  and  the \nprospect of tighter monetary policy generate large \ncapital  inflows  into  the  region.  In  the  absence \nof  controls  to  stem  such  capital  inflows,  greater \nexchange-rate flexibility vis-a-vis the United States \n(US)  dollar,  euro,  and  other  major  international \ncurrencies is needed to maintain macroeconomic \nand financial stability. A common regional strategy \nwould  then  entail  maintaining  relatively  stable \nexchange rates within the region and a collective \nappreciation  of  Asian  currencies  against  the  US \ndollar, euro, and other non-Asian currencies. This \nwould  require  exchange-rate  policy  coordination \n(Kawai 2009). \n\nGiven the size and importance to the region of \nthe Japanese and People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n\neconomies, such coordination could potentially be \nanchored  around  either  the  Japanese  yen  or  the \nChinese  yuan.  The  attraction  of  the  yen  is  that  it \nis  fully  convertible,  while  the  Japanese  economy, \nalthough growing slowly and recently overtaken by \nthe PRC\u2019s, remains very important to the region. In \nthe case of the yuan, while its international role will \ninevitably  grow  as  the  PRC\u2019s  economy  continues \nto expand rapidly, it may take a long time for it to \nbecome  a  fully  convertible  international  currency \nthat  could  serve  as  Asia\u2019s  sole  anchor  currency. \nThere  is  therefore  a  case  for  creating  a  basket \nof  appropriately  weighted  regional  currencies. \nIn  recent  years,  various  authors  have  proposed \nintroducing such a regional currency basket in Asia \n(Kawai  and  Takagi  2005;  Adams  and  Chow  2007; \nOgawa  and  Shimizu  2007;  Girardin  and  Steinherr \n2008). \n\nOne  idea  is  to  create  an  Asian  currency \nunit  (ACU)  as  a  basket  of  the  currencies  of  the \n13  ASEAN+3  countries.  An  ACU  index  could  aid \n\nThe  creation  of  this  new  facility  will  allow  more  investment-\ngrade  domestic  companies  to  access  local-currency  and  regional \ndebt  markets.  As  local  companies  tap  local  debt  markets  for  either \nlong-term  funding  or  refinancing  needs,  it  will  help  them  to  curtail \nboth  foreign  exchange  and  maturity  mismatches.  With  guarantees \nfor corporate bonds, the CGIF will help to mobilize savings to finance \ninvestment in domestic markets and across the ASEAN+3 region, and \nalso promote the harmonization of standards and practices for bond \nissuance. This will help to integrate regional financial markets further. \nProviding  credit  protection  to  investors  should  also  help  unlock  the \nregion\u2019s vast savings for badly needed investment in infrastructure and \nother key areas. \n\nAnother  important  proposal  is  to  establish  an  ASEAN+3  Bond \nMarket  Forum  as  a  common  platform  to  help  standardize  market \npractices  and  harmonize \nto  cross-border \ntransactions in the region. ASEAN+3 has also actively supported the \n\nregulations  relating \n\n224\n\n\fPolicy Options\n\neconomic surveillance: the collective movements \nof Asian exchange rates against the US dollar and \neuro  could  be  measured  and  their  divergence \nfrom the ACU analyzed. To achieve some degree \nof  exchange-rate  stability  in  the  region,  Asian \nauthorities  could  discuss  and  take  corrective \naction  based  on  economic  fundamentals  as  well \nas the ACU divergence indicators.\n\nAn ACU index could also be used to denominate \nregional  financial  assets,  such  as  bank  deposits \nand \nloans,  government  and  corporate  bonds, \nand  foreign  exchange  reserve  holdings.  It  would \nbe  particularly  useful  if  the  Asian  Bond  Markets \nInitiative developed bonds denominated in the ACU, \nas this would require the introduction of regulatory \nstandards, taxes, and other reforms at the national \nlevel,  as  well  as  the  regional  settlement  of  cross-\nborder bond transactions. The creation of national \nenvironments  conducive  to  the  private  use  of  an \nACU index could also permit the parallel currency \napproach advocated by Eichengreen (2006). Once \n\nthere had been substantial convergence of political, \neconomic, \ninstitutional,  and  social  conditions \nacross  the  region,  more  formal  exchange-rate \ncoordination mechanisms could also be developed \naround the ACU.\n\nOne  difficult  issue  is  setting  the  weight  of \neach  currency  in  the  basket.  Experts  broadly \nagree that the weights should reflect factors such \nas  countries\u2019  gross  domestic  product,  trade,  and \nfinancial transactions. The ACU weights of the yen \nand yuan would therefore be larger than those of \nother ASEAN+3 currencies. But there is no single \ncorrect  answer,  and  the  political  implications  of \nmaking  perceived  assessments  of  relative  power \nin the region complicate matters further. However, \nthe Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM) \nagreement in May 2009 offers a potential solution to \nthe impasse. The contribution shares for the CMIM \nreserve  pool  (see  Chapter  2)  could  be  used  to \ndetermine the weights of each ASEAN+3 country \nin a common currency basket (Kawai 2009). \n\ncapacity  development  of  domestic  credit  rating  agencies,  helping \nthem adopt international best practices and enhance the credibility of \ntheir ratings.102 These are important, since global rating agencies often \nprovide limited and inadequate ratings for domestic companies, owing \nto a lack of local knowledge and in some cases perhaps insufficient \ndata. Unfortunately, although the Association of Credit Rating Agencies \nin  Asia  has  provided  technical  support  to  local  rating  agencies, \ndomestic ratings are often not based on comparable methodologies, \ncriteria,  benchmarks,  and  overall  rating  processes.  The  creation  of \na regional credit rating agency would help to address some of these \nanomalies and lead to better risk assessments. \n\n102  As part of this initiative, ADB in 2008 brought out a Handbook on International Best  Practices \n\nin Credit Rating (ADB 2008c). The role of global rating agencies has come under fresh \nscrutiny after the recent global crisis, especially after their failure to highlight the credit risk \nof structured products.\n\n225\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\n6.5. Establishing New and Stronger \nPan-Asian Institutions \n\nWhile  a  range  of  issues  requiring  cooperation  can  be  dealt  with \neffectively  at  the  subregional  or  intraregional  level,  wider  issues  are \nbetter addressed at the level of Asia and the Pacific as a whole. This will \nrequire building new pan-Asian institutions while strengthening the two \nexisting  ones,  ADB  and  the  UN  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for \nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which play important roles as facilitating \nIRIs. Ultimately, new pan-Asian institutions could be gathered under an \numbrella organization, such as a Council of Asian Economic Cooperation \n(CAEC) that would act as a coordinating body governed at the highest \npolitical level. In particular, new pan-regional institutions could include: \n\u2022  a  Pan-Asian  Infrastructure  Forum  (PAIF)  to  address  the \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nincreasing needs of regional infrastructure development; \n\n\u2022  an Asia-Wide Free Trade Area (Asia-FTA) to facilitate trade and \ninvestment  integration  by  consolidating  existing  bilateral  and \nplurilateral FTAs; \n\n\u2022  an  Asian  Monetary  Fund  (AMF) \n\nregional \nmacroeconomic surveillance and provide financial assistance \nin case of crises;\n\nto  conduct \n\n\u2022  an  Asian  Financial  Stability  Dialogue  to  address  regional \nfinancial  stability  and  regulatory  issues,  while  promoting  the \ndevelopment of Asia\u2019s financial markets; \n\n\u2022  an  Asian  Legal  Advisory  Council  (ALAC)  to  improve  the \npredictability of legal obligations by ensuring that international \nagreements are implemented and interpreted uniformly across \nthe region; and \n\n\u2022  several  regional  public  goods  forums  (RPGFs)  to  promote \nregional  cooperation  in  dealing  with  issues  such  as  natural \ncalamities, climate change, and health concerns. \n\nPan-Asian  Infrastructure  Forum.  The  approach  to  regional \ninfrastructure  cooperation  in  Asia  has  been  flexible,  pragmatic,  and \nmarket-driven.  While  existing  pan-Asian  initiatives  such  as  the  Asian \nLand  Transport  Infrastructure  Development\u2014which  comprises  the \nAsian  Highway,  the  Trans-Asian  Railway,  and  the  facilitation  of  land \ntransport projects through intermodal transport terminals\u2014have made \nsome progress, much more needs to be done (Chapter 2). \n\nIn  view  of  Asia\u2019s  diverse  needs  and  circumstances,  and  varying \npolitical  commitment  to  closer  integration,  overlapping  subregional \nprograms proceeding at different speeds and on different tracks have \n\n226\n\n\foffered  the  best  way  forward.  Cooperation  in  small  groups,  from \nthe  bottom  up,  has  also  proven  more  manageable  and  thus  likely \nto  progress  faster  than  top\u2013down  programs  and  projects,  especially \nwhen group members have common objectives and reasonably good \nrelations. But while national programs and cooperation for subregional \ninfrastructure  development  will  continue  to  be  the  building  blocks \nin  the  creation  of  pan-Asian  infrastructure  networks,  the  need  to \nrebalance  Asia\u2019s  economy  toward  increasing  domestic  demand  to \nsatisfy local needs requires prioritizing improvements in connectivity \nwithin the region (Chapter 2). There is a growing case, therefore, for \ncomplementing the region\u2019s traditional approach to this problem with \na more market-creating and demand-inducing approach.\n\ninfrastructure \n\nThe  Infrastructure  for  a  Seamless  Asia  study  (ADB/ADBI  2009) \nrecommended  that  a  PAIF  be  established  to  help  coordinate  and \ninitiatives.  Such  an \nintegrate  existing  subregional \ninstitution would bring together the region\u2019s key stakeholders and help \nbuild consensus and prioritize and coordinate regional infrastructure \nplans. In particular, a PAIF could help develop harmonized regulatory \nand  legal  standards  based  on  international  best  practices,  while \ncontributing to the development of a common framework for handling \nand mitigating negative social and environmental impacts. Following \nthe recommendations of the Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia study, \na PAIF would need to work closely with an advisory group of experts \nto  develop  a  pan-regional  vision  of  Asia\u2019s  infrastructure  needs  and \nidentify and appraise prospective projects.103 \n\nThe  report  also  proposed  the  establishment  of  an  Asian \nInfrastructure  Fund  (AIF)  to  help  mobilize  international  funds  and \nprepare and finance bankable regional infrastructure projects. The AIF\u2019s \ncapital could come from a variety of sources, including governments, \nmultilateral development banks, bilateral agencies, sovereign wealth \nfunds, and Islamic financial institutions. The AIF should have a legal \nidentity in order to help finance projects through its own resources, as \nwell as by issuing bonds and cofinancing with other entities, including \nprivate investors.\n\nTo  encourage  private  sector  participation  and  cross-border \ninvestment flows, Asia could formulate a comprehensive investment \nagreement,  as  ASEAN  has,  to  extend  national  treatment  to  foreign \ninvestors.  The  AIF  would  help  finance  projects  identified  and \n\n103  To varying degrees, the EC performs this role in the EU, as does the Initiative for the \n\nIntegration of Regional Infrastructure in South America in that region. In the GMS, CAREC, \nand SASEC programs, ADB experts have provided analogous assistance.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n227\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nprioritized  by  the  PAIF.  It  would  therefore  need  a  facility  to  expedite \nand help finance the preparation of projects, as well as one to provide \ngrants and concessional financing to encourage countries to prioritize \nregional projects in their national development programs. It may also \nneed to provide guarantees against major risks (ADB/ADBI 2009).\n\nAsia-Wide Free Trade Area. Bilateral and plurilateral FTAs have \nplayed  an  important  role  in  deepening  trade  links  in  the  region.  But \nthey divert trade as well as creating it, resulting in a \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d of \noverlapping FTAs that creates complications for Asian trade as well as \nfacilitating it (Chapter 2).104 A solution to this problem is to consolidate \nexisting bilateral and plurilateral FTAs into a comprehensive Asia-Wide \nFree  Trade  Area  (Asia-FTA)  that  would  also  liberalize  investment. \nEurope\u2019s  experience  suggests  that  region-wide  free  trade  and \ninvestment can stimulate efficiency and growth.105 \n\nAn  Asia-FTA  would  eliminate  domestic  policy  distortions  to \nintra-Asian  trade  and  investment,  enhance  the  region\u2019s  business \nenvironment, and could even help unblock the WTO\u2019s Doha Round, \nas many of the concessions on agricultural and industrial goods and \nservices  might  already  be  incorporated  into  the  agreement  (Kawai \nand  Wignaraja  forthcoming).  It  would  also  boost  intraregional  trade \nand investment through the formation of a larger regional market, the \nrealization  of  economies  of  scale,  and  the  facilitation  of  technology \ntransfers.  Ultimately\u2014by  fostering  regional  demand\u2014it  would  favor \na rebalancing of Asia\u2019s economic growth and offer insurance against \nrising protectionist sentiments. \n\nOne practical way forward would be to take the best features from \nexisting regional FTAs and design a \u201cboilerplate\u201d regional agreement \nthat is both comprehensive in scope and consistent with WTO rules. \nA \u201cWTO-plus\u201d Asia-FTA\u2014going beyond Uruguay Round commitments \nand  current  offers  in  the  WTO\u2019s  Doha  Round\u2014would  provide  the \nbiggest benefits to individual Asian countries and the region as a whole. \nGiven existing proposals, detailed in Chapter 2, to create an FTA among \nASEAN+3 countries (the East Asia Free Trade Agreement\u2014EAFTA), the \nEAS (the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia\u2014CEPEA), \nand APEC members (the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific\u2014FTAAP), \nan  optimal  solution  would  be  to  adopt  a  sequential,  bottom\u2013up  \napproach from EAFTA to CEPEA and eventually to FTAAP, as well as a \npartnership with Europe (Kawai and Wignaraja 2008). \n\n104  On the \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d effect see also Baldwin (2009).\n105  In the EU, a region-wide free trade area culminated in a customs union regulated by the \n\nEC, with higher competence than national institutions (Chapter 5).\n\n228\n\n\fHowever, since it may be near impossible for member countries \nto phase out existing agreements, an Asia-FTA could in practice turn \nout  to  be  a  series  of  linked  agreements  with  variable  membership \nand  issue  coverage.  It  would  then  be  desirable  to  move  quickly  to \nestablish  a  customs  union\u2014to  extend  the  Asia-FTA  by  negotiating  a \ncommon external tariff. This would obviate the need for complex and \nburdensome regulation of rules of origin. \n\nAs  Asia  creates  a  region-wide  FTA  and  a  customs  union,  it  is \ntempting to imagine that this development might be accompanied by \na monetary union. Box 6.3 explains why recent experience, not least \nin Europe itself, counsels caution.\n\nAsian Monetary Fund. As the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis and its \naftermath have shown, Asia needs its own monetary fund to conduct \neffective  regional  macroeconomic  surveillance,  provide  prompt \nliquidity  support  to  countries  that  experience  financial  crises,  and \nformulate and monitor proper policy conditionality in order to ensure \nrepayment  and  the  restoration  of  macroeconomic  and  financial \nstability. Such an AMF could emerge by delinking the CMIM\u2019s lending \nfrom IMF programs once AMRO is properly staffed. With the requisite \nanalytical  expertise  and  policy  experience  and  proper  governance \nstructures, AMRO could become a strong, professional AMF secretariat \nthat is capable of supporting the CMIM independently of the IMF and of \nnational political pressures. \n\nIf  the  CMIM  is  to  be  transformed  into  an  AMF,  the  quality  of \neconomic surveillance, currently conducted as part of ERPD under the \nASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 Process, needs to improve so that lending \nconditionality can be formulated independently of IMF programs. This, \nin turn, requires the establishment of a joint forum for finance ministers \nand central bank governors to intensify their policy dialogue (along the \nlines  of  the  Asian  Financial  Stability  Dialogue  discussed  below)  and \nmove beyond information sharing to more rigorous peer review and \npeer pressure, and eventually due diligence.\n\nWhen  AMRO  becomes  operational  in  May  2011,  the  rules  for \nactivating CMIM lending should become clear. These should include \nthe  possibility  of  precautionary  lending  without  conditionality  (along \nthe lines of the flexible credit line and precautionary credit line recently \nintroduced by the IMF for preventing financial crises in countries with \nvery strong fundamentals) and eschewing policy conditionality in the \nevent  of  external  financial  turbulence  or  panic.106  To  move  toward \n\n106  Such assistance would have provided great relief, for example, to the Republic of Korea \n\nduring the financial turbulence it experienced in the fall of 2008.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n229\n\n\fcreation  of  a  regional  currency  is  best  regarded \nas  a  long-run  goal:  as  the  culmination  of\u2014rather \nthan a stepping-stone toward\u2014the formation of an \nAsian economic community.\n\nfor \n\nThe  surveys  conducted \n\nthis  report \nand  for  the  Emerging  Asian  Regionalism  study \n(ADB  2008b)  suggest  that  there  is  widespread \nthat  Asian \nskepticism  about \ncountries  might  create  a  common  currency. \nThat said, the share of respondents who believe \nthat  a  common  currency  will  never  be  created \nhas  fallen  from  57%  in  2007  to  47%  in  2010,  as \nFigure 6.5 shows.\n\nthe  possibility \n\nFigure 6.5.

Should Asia have a Common Currency?\n\nW hile  a  common  currency  reduces \n\ntransaction  costs  within  a  region,  it \nalso  creates  risks  of  imbalances  and \ninstability.  Europe\u2019s  experience  suggests  that  a \nwell-functioning  monetary  union  requires  trans-\nnational oversight of national fiscal policies, which \nare  widely  regarded  as  an  important  sovereign \nprerogative, not least in Asia. One important lesson \nfor Asian policy-makers from the recent eurozone \ncrisis is that creating a common currency requires \na  parallel  commitment  to  develop  institutions  of \nfiscal  federalism\u2014to  provide  temporary  transfers \nto  countries  experiencing  economic  difficulties \nnot  of  their  own  making.  It \nrequires  a  willingness  to  fund \nand  operate  an  emergency \n financing  mechanism  and  to \naccept transnational oversight \nof  national  banking  systems, \nproblems  with  which  can \npose a threat to confidence in \na monetary union. \n\n100%\n\n80%\n\nAll  this,  in  turn,  implies \nto  political \na  commitment \nif  not  political \nsolidarity, \nitself.  While  the \nintegration \nin  1999 \nthe  euro \nbirth  of \nand  its  increasing  role  as  an \ninternational currency provides \nimportant  precedent  for  \nan \nto  create  a \nany  attempt \ncommon  currency  for  Asia, \nthe recent eurozone crisis is a \nreminder that monetary union \nshould  not  be  contemplated \nthe \nprematurely.

In  response  to  the  1997/98 \nand  2008/09  crises  and  the  increased  need  for  cooperation  both \nwithin and across domestic financial systems, a new regional financial \narchitecture  is  taking  shape  through  multiple  layers  of  regional \narrangements  and  institutions.  These  aim  to  make  the  region  more \nresilient to future crises, through improved regulation and supervision, \nand  better  capable  of  tackling  them  in  coordination  with  global \nagencies. They will also enable Asia to have a stronger voice in global \nforums commensurate with its growing economic importance.\n\nTo deepen regional financial cooperation and integration, ADB in \n2008 proposed the creation of an AFSD, a regional forum that would \nbring  together  all  responsible  authorities\u2014finance  ministries,  central \nbanks,  financial  supervisors  and  regulators,  and  representatives  of \nthe  private  sector\u2014to  address  financial  market  vulnerabilities  and \nregulations,  promote  financial  market  development,  and  introduce \ninitiatives for regional financial integration (ADB 2008b). The 2008/09 \nglobal  economic  and  financial  crisis  underscored  the  importance  of \nintroducing sound financial regulations and proper market governance. \nAn  AFSD  would  complement  and  coordinate  with  other  institutions \nsuch as AMRO that focus mainly on macroeconomic surveillance and \npolicies, as well as monitoring policy implementation. \n\nSeveral Asian developing economies need to continue liberalizing \ntheir  domestic  and  cross-border  regulation  of  financial  services  and \nfinancial  flows.  The  AFSD  could  help  national  financial  authorities \nstrengthen  their  domestic  regulations  and  supervision.  It  could  also \nhelp them coordinate their efforts to ensure financial stability through \ninformation  exchange,  the  mutual  recognition  of  market  practices, \nand the harmonization of minimum supervisory rules. To maximize its \n\n107  Like the ones faced by Indonesia in the summer of 2005 (currency) and by Thailand toward \n\nthe end of 2006 (capital flows).\n\nPolicy Options\n\n231\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\neffectiveness, it could be situated within an overarching intraregional \nIRI,  such  as  ASEAN+3  or  the  EAS.  As  described  in  Section  6.3,  on \nAsia-specific issues the AFSD would play a role similar to that of the \nFSB  at  a  global  level,  while  coordinating  Asia\u2019s  participation  in  the \nFSB and other global organizations such as the Bank for International \nSettlements (BIS). \n\nAsian  Legal  Advisory  Council.  Even  in  cases  where  Asian \ngovernments  want  to  see  international  obligations  implemented, \nnational administrative agencies or courts may not always be equipped \nto do so. This new institution\u2014composed of experts in international \ncommercial and business law\u2014would, at the request of national courts \nor administrative agencies, issue advisory opinions on a well-defined \nset of treaties and conventions that countries have ratified. Since no \nequivalent  global  institution  exists,  such  an  institutional  innovation \ncould be created more quickly at the regional level.\n\nImportantly,  this  regional  advisory  council  would  leave  the \nresolution  of  disputes  to  national  courts.  This  arrangement \nis \nappropriate,  since  disputes  often  involve  a  mixture  of  domestic \nand  international  legal  issues  that  can  be  better  assessed  by  local \ncourts\u2014and it would also alleviate sovereignty concerns. Specifically, \nALAC would not have a mandate to interpret domestic law or make \njudgments as to whether domestic law contradicts international legal \nobligations. This approach conforms to the approach to building IRIs \nknown as the \u201cASEAN way\u201d (Chapter 4).\n\nAn optional protocol could give any party to a dispute in that country \nthe  right  to  refer  a  question  about  the  appropriate  interpretation  of \ninternational law to ALAC. Ratifying such a protocol would thus signal \na commitment to the uniform application of international obligations. \nGovernments  that  had  not  signed  the  optional  protocol  might  still \nrequest advisory opinions in certain circumstances. While this would \nnot  indicate  the  same  commitment,  it  could  promote  more  uniform \ninterpretation. \n\nRegional  Public  Goods  Forums.  For  all  its  benefits,  Asia\u2019s \nincreasing  interdependence  has  also  increased  its  vulnerability  to \nnegative  externalities  generated  within  or  outside  the  region.  Asian \ncountries  have  therefore  become  active  participants  in  global  and \nregional forums dealing with issues such as natural calamities, climate \nchange,  and  health  concerns.  Discussions  on  the  provision  of  these \npublic goods at a regional level, however, still lack proper coordinating \nmechanisms.  Initiatives  usually  emerge  from  individual  countries, \nspecific  interest  groups,  or  existing  global  forums,  but  are  scarcely \ncoordinated region-wide.\n\n232\n\n\fAsia  would  benefit  in  particular  from  the  creation  of  regional \n\npublic goods forums to tackle: \n \n\n\u2022  environmental  issues\u2014not  only  climate  change,  but  also \nthe  consequences  of  urban  and  industrial  expansion  and  the \ndepletion of natural resources, such as air pollution, dust and \nsandstorms, marine and coastal management, and competition \namong countries over riverine resources;\n\n\u2022  natural  disasters\u2014such  as  tsunamis,  flooding,  earthquakes, \nand  volcanic  eruptions\u2014through  early  warning  systems,  a \nregional disaster response system, and a high degree of donor \ncoordination; and\n\n\u2022  communicable  diseases\u2014the  emergence  and  rapid  spread \nof  diseases  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  SARS,  and  avian  flu\u2014through \nregional \nframeworks  and  coordinated  actions  among \nvulnerable  countries  as  well  as  between  developed  and \ndeveloping countries.\n\n \n\n \n\nOther  pan-Asian  public  goods  forums  could  seek  to  promote \nlow-carbon green growth, clean energy, and energy efficiency, which \nare  related  to  the  successful  implementation  of  climate  change \nadaptation  and  mitigation  strategies,  and  control  international  crime \nand  money  laundering,  which  are  becoming  increasingly  important \nproblems as the region improves its infrastructure and trade facilitation \nmechanisms. \n\nCouncil of Asian Economic Cooperation. Most ambitiously, Asia \ncould  contemplate  creating  an  umbrella  organization  governed  at \nthe  highest  political  level  to  address  the  wide  range  of  pan-regional \nissues  discussed  above.  Such  a  council  could  ensure  that  all  Asian \ncountries are represented and have a voice in regional integration. It \ncould provide a mechanism for coordinating the various subregions\u2019 \ninitiatives. It could capture synergies and spillovers between economic \nand security cooperation. It would be a natural forum for addressing \npan-regional  issues  such  as  climate  change  and  epidemics.  It  could \nalso be a vehicle through which Asian countries could represent their \ncommon positions in global venues and forums more effectively. For \nall these reasons, the creation of a CAEC would be an important step \ntoward an Asian economic community.\n\nThe CAEC would be a venue for those outside the core group of \nintegrating  Asian  economies  to  voice  concerns  about  the  potentially \ndiscriminatory effects of the measures adopted by the pioneers, and \nfor the pioneers to provide reassurance about the nondiscriminatory \nintent of their initiatives, through words and where necessary action. \nIt could also provide an antechamber for economies such as those of \n\nPolicy Options\n\n233\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nCentral and South Asia that are not yet part of \u201cFactory Asia\u201d but would \nbenefit  from  more  connectivity  with  East  Asia  and  its  production \nnetworks.\n\nFor the CAEC to achieve its key objective of ensuring the broadest \npossible representation and voice, Asia needs to be defined inclusively. \nThis is the convoy model of membership described in Chapter 3. As \ndiscussed  in  Chapter  2,  there  exist  several  alternative  definitions  of \nAsia.  An  encompassing  definition  that  subsumes  Central,  East,  and \nSouth Asia plus the Pacific would be the most comprehensive. ADB\u2019s \nbroad membership shows how this is possible. Expanding ASEAN+3 \nto the EAS by including India, Australia, and New Zealand \u201cfor purposes \nof  dialogue  on  broad  strategic,  political  and  economic  issues\u201d108  is \nan  important  step  in  this  direction.  And  the  EAS  should  be  seen  as \na stepping-stone toward a much broader pan-Asian institution rather \nthan as an end point. \n\nIn  its  coordination  role,  the  CAEC  could  provide  a  venue  for \nagreeing key principles to be applied across subregional institutions, \nsuch  as  nondiscrimination  and  transparency.  In  the  security  area, \nit  could  prescribe  that  states  adhere  to  the  principles  of  ASEAN\u2019s \nTreaty  of  Amity  and  Cooperation.  A  standing  pan-Asian  institution \ncould also provide a venue for regular, structured interaction among \nsubregional IRIs.\n\nA  pan-regional  institution  such  as  the  CAEC  could  be  a  vehicle \nthrough which Asian countries could represent their common positions \nin multilateral institutions more effectively. For instance, it would be an \nappropriate  place  for  developing  common  positions  to  be  advanced \nin global forums such as the G20. A pan-regional grouping could also \npromote  \u201cpan-Asian  citizenry\u201d  by  facilitating  the  liberalization  of  air \ntransport, the free movement of persons via the adoption of simplified \nvisa rules, and student exchanges (which are particularly valuable for \nbuilding trust).109\n\nThis report has advocated the creation of a set of specialized pan-\nregional  institutions,  each  with  a  specific  mandate  and  concrete  set \nof  responsibilities:  a  PAIF,  an  Asia-FTA,  an  AMF,  an  AFSD,  an  ALAC, \nand  several  RPGFs.  But  while  separate  pan-Asian  institutions  might \nfind  it  easier  to  harmonize  policies  in  specific  issue  areas,  a  single \nencompassing  one  might  be  better  able  to  capture  synergies  and \n\n108  Chair\u2019s press statement at the seventh ASEAN+3 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting.\n109  Then Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in an address in Singapore on 15 November \n2009 called for increasing student exchanges among Asian countries and facilitating the \nexchange of university students by agreeing to accept the portability of academic credits \nearned by exchange students abroad. \n\n234\n\n\fspillovers between them, as Chapter 3 explained. With the entire set \nof  issues  on  the  table  in  a  single  forum,  greater  scope  for  mutually \nbeneficial  agreements  (cross-issue  tradeoffs)  would  exist.  Countries \nthat  might  resist  agreements  on  political  or  security  matters  that  are \na  priority  for  their  neighbors  may,  for  example,  be  willing  to  sign  on \nin  return  for  an  agreement  on  economic  matters  which  they  deem \nimportant.  The  costs  of  failing  to  cooperate  in  any  area  would  be \nmagnified,  insofar  as  this  sours  prospects  for  cooperating  in  other \nareas.  In  particular,  deeper  economic  cooperation  and  integration \ntends  to  encourage  cooperation  on  security  matters,  since  conflict \n(and  the  associated  economic  disruption)  becomes  more  costly. \nIncorporating economic and security discussions within a single pan-\nAsian institution may thus promote cooperation. \n\nDifferent institutional designs would be best suited for achieving \none  or  more  of  the  diverse  aims  of  a  pan-regional  organization.  A \nnetwork  approach  with  limited  agenda-setting  and  decision-making \npowers would be suitable for harmonizing subregional arrangements, \ncapturing  positive  spillovers between  them,  and averting conflicts. A \nmore  hierarchical  alternative,  with  the  new  pan-regional  institution \nat  the  apex  of  the  institutional  pyramid,  would  be  more  suitable  for \naddressing  issues  of  pan-regional  scope  and  representing  Asia  in \ninteractions with major powers outside the region. The history of Asian \nIRIs suggests that while any new pan-regional institution would start \nout being structured along relatively nonhierarchical lines, its structure \ncould evolve.\n\nPan-regional  facilitating  IRIs:  ADB  and  ESCAP.  ADB  and \nESCAP,  Asia\u2019s  only  two  pan-regional  facilitating  institutions,  play \ncrucial  complementary  roles  in  promoting  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.  ADB  contributes  analysis  and  finance  for  the  provision \nof  regional  public  goods,  notably  those  related  to  economic \ndevelopment  and  infrastructure,  while  ESCAP  provides  support  for \ninfrastructure development and monitors countries\u2019 progress toward \nthe UN Millennium Development Goals. Both need to strengthen their \nfinancial and human resources devoted to regional cooperation and \nintegration  (RCI)  activities  and  collaborate  more  closely  on  areas  of \ncommon interest.\n\nAs  a  part  of  the  formal  UN  system,  ESCAP  is  particularly  able  to \ninvolve governments that wish to have a strong stake in the institution. A \nstrategy for strengthening ESCAP would capitalize on this comparative \nadvantage  and  address  its  lack  of  funding,  enabling  it  to  hire  more \nexperts  and  prepare  technical  projects  in  specific  areas  of  regional \ncooperation such as infrastructure development and trade facilitation. \n\nPolicy Options\n\n235\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nIndividual governments and international donors also ought to provide \nESCAP with the necessary resources to complete the Asian Highway \nand  Trans-Asian  Railway  programs,  which  would  boost  economic \ndevelopment  through  better  infrastructure  and  connectivity.  In  this \narea and others, ADB and ESCAP should collaborate more closely.\n\nADB\u2019s  role  in  promoting  regional  cooperation  is  as  a  financier, \nhonest  broker,  knowledge  provider,  and  capacity  builder  (Kuroda \n2008). As financier, it provides loans and grants to support RCI projects. \nAs honest broker, it acts as a catalyst and coordinator for its member \ncountries  and  several  regional  forums.  As  knowledge  provider,  it \ncreates,  consolidates,  and  disseminates  knowledge  and  information \non RCI. And as capacity builder, it helps ADB member countries and \nsubregional and regional bodies build their institutional capacities to \nmanage RCI issues. \n\nADB  has  contributed  to  regional  cooperation  in  several  ways.  It \nhas created subregional programs such as GMS, CAREC, and SASEC. It \nadopted an RCI strategy in 2006, and has prepared knowledge products \ncovering  various  RCI  themes  (including  this  report).  In  addition,  its \nStrategy  2020,  adopted  in  April  2008,  identifies  RCI  as  one  of  ADB\u2019s \ncore areas of operation and sets an important target of lending at least \n30% of its total loans to regional projects by the year 2020.\n\nHowever, ADB needs to devote even more human and financial \nresources to promoting RCI programs and projects to meet the growing \ndemand from the region, not least for knowledge products. Given the \nincreasing reputation ADB is gaining for its work on RCI, it is also well \npositioned  to  collaborate  more  closely  with  national  and  regional \nagencies in setting up new IRIs at the subregional, intraregional, and \npan-regional levels, for instance the PAIF.\n\n6.6. From Goals to Strategies\n\nGoals are one thing; strategies for achieving them are another. Since \nAsia\u2019s  policy-making  tends  to  be  pragmatic  and  cautious,  efforts  to \nstrengthen its regional architecture should proceed in this mold. They \nwill succeed only if they respect Asia\u2019s distinctive styles and traditions. \nInstitutional  innovations  and  reforms  that  are  aimed  at  making \nmarkets work better and limited to specific initiatives and objectives \nare likely to fare best. Measures with a clear payoff are likely to garner \nmost support. Opinion leaders surveyed for this study are keenest on \ninstitutions  promising  tangible  benefits  such  as  trade,  investment, \n\n236\n\n\fand financial stability (Appendix 1). IRIs should be lean and carefully \nstructured  to  achieve  their  purpose.  They  should  reach  decisions  by \nconsensus  where  necessary,  and  by  more  decisive  means  where \npossible: an approach consistent with Asian governments\u2019 attachment \nto their sovereignty. And since Asia is an economically very open region, \nefforts to strengthen its IRIs should seek to maximize cooperation and \ncomplementarities with global institutions.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  formulating  a  proper  strategy  to  strengthen \nAsia\u2019s IRIs and move toward an Asian economic community requires \nstrong  commitment  from  political  leadership,  adequate  financial \nresources, and a knowledge community of scholars, business people, \ngovernment officials, and other parties with a shared commitment to \nAsian regionalism.\n\nPolitical  leadership.  Shaping  a  new  institutional  architecture  in \nAsia and the Pacific will require effective high-level political leadership. \nTheory (see Chapter 3) and experience, in both Asia (Chapter 4) and \nother  regions  (Chapter  5),  underscore  the  critical  role  that  can  be \nplayed  by  national  leaders  with  a  vision  for  strengthening  a  region\u2019s \ninstitutional  architecture  and  the  power  and  energy  to  advance  that \nagenda.  In  Europe,  this  high-level  leadership  has  historically  come \nfrom  French  and  German  leaders,  working  together  in  an  effort  to \npreserve  a  balance  of  power  within  the  region\u2014whether  Helmut \nSchmidt  and  Val\u00e9ry  Giscard  d\u2019Estaing  in  the  1970s  or  Helmut  Kohl \nand Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in the 1990s. Politicians from other European \ncountries have also played a key leadership role at important junctures \nin the European integration process. In both cases, bold and visionary \nleadership has been vital.\n\nAsian leaders have set out their visions of an Asian community that \ncould engage in dialogue, cooperation, and action on economic and \npolitical matters and face future challenges collectively. These include \nthe idea of an \u201cAsia-Pacific Community\u201d from former Australian Prime \nMinister Kevin Rudd, the call by then Japanese Prime Minister Yukio \nHatoyama  to  create  an  \u201cEast  Asian  Community,\u201d  Republic  of  Korea \nPresident  Lee  Myung-bak\u2019s  idea  of  a  \u201cNew  Asia  Initiative,\u201d  PRC \nPresident Hu Jintao\u2019s promotion of a \u201cHarmonious Asia,\u201d and Indian \nPrime  Minister  Manmohan  Singh\u2019s  commitment  to  build  an  Asian \neconomic community. \n\nWe  are  witnessing  a  growing  commitment  from  the  region\u2019s \nleaders toward a more integrated Asia. But while momentum toward \npan-Asian  regionalism  is  building,  there  is  also  awareness  that  the \ninstitutional  capacity  to  support  these  ideas  remains  constrained. \nThese  proposals  by  political  leaders  acknowledge  the  challenge \n\nPolicy Options\n\n237\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nof  converting  political  vision  into  the  process  of  institution  building, \nespecially  by  empowering  Asia\u2019s  IRIs  to  enable  them  to  be  more \neffective in delivering their mandates. There is increasing recognition \nof  the  fact  that  declarations  on  strengthening  regional  integration  at \nsummits  and  official  meetings  need  to  be  translated  into  activities \nand programs. Asia\u2019s political leaders have also started paying more \nattention  to  the  importance  of  translating  official  statements  on \nregionalism  into  popular  sentiments  and  bringing  its  discourse  from \nthe current experts\u2019 and technocrats\u2019 level to that of laypersons.110\n\nGiven  the  region\u2019s  diversity,  building  Asian  regionalism  will \nrequire  collective  leadership  that  achieves  an  adequate  balance  of \npower  among  the  participants.  Unless  all  participants  feel  they  have \na  proper  role  that  recognizes  their  collective  ownership  and  shared \nleadership,  it  will  be  difficult  to  fulfill  the  visions  laid  out  by  Asia\u2019s \nleaders.  Established  powers  such  as  Japan,  emerging  ones  such  as \nthe PRC and India, and middling ones such as the Republic of Korea, \nwhich seeks to act as an intermediary between the PRC and Japan, \nASEAN,  which  aims  to  create  an  AEC  by  2015  and  will  undoubtedly \ncontinue to lead by example, and Australia all have an important role \nin  building  institutions  to  integrate  Asia.  In  other  words,  the  shared \nleadership of established, emerging, and middling powers will provide \nthe backbone for building an economic community in Asia.\n\nFinancial  resources.  Any  proposal \n\nfor  reforming  existing \ninstitutions or creating new ones must weigh the benefits against the \ncosts\u2014not  least,  the  financial  expense  of  staffing  an  organization, \nhousing  it,  and  administering  its  operations.  The  cost  of  expanding \nexisting  organizations  and  arrangements  can  be  estimated  relatively \nwell  by  scaling  up  their  current  budgets.  But  estimating  the  cost  of \ncreating  new  institutions  designed  to  serve  the  long-term  vision  of \nforming an Asian economic community is inevitably more speculative. \nThere can be no definite answer, since it depends on a host of factors, \nnot  least  what  the  organization  would  be  expected  to  do  and  how \neffective member governments would want it to be. \n\nOne starting point is to extrapolate from the costs associated with \nexisting IRIs. These vary widely. APEC\u2019s small secretariat in Singapore \ngets by on a shoestring. Headed by an executive director working with \na  small  team  of  program  directors  seconded  from  APEC  member \neconomies,  it  has  an  annual  operating  budget  of  around  $3  million \n\n110  One recent example of these is the speech given by India\u2019s Prime Minister Manmohan \n\nSingh at the 16th SAARC Summit on 28 April 2010 in Thimphu, Bhutan (http://pmindia.nic \n.in/speeches.htm).\n\n238\n\n\f(Japan  MOFA  2006;  Gnygell  and  Cook  2005).  Its  tiny  budget  reflects \nAPEC\u2019s  informal,  decentralized,  lightly  institutionalized  nature.  That \nsaid, APEC leaders have agreed to help strengthen the secretariat by \nincreasing member contributions by 30% from 2009.111\n\nASEAN\u2019s  secretariat  also  has  a  very  small  operating  budget  of \naround  $10  million  a  year,  limited  by  its  funding  formula  of  equal \ncontribution from member countries.112 Due to its limited budget, the \nASEAN  secretariat  is  understaffed  and  under-resourced,  with  poorly \npaid  positions  and  related  problems  in  attracting  top-caliber  staff. \nAs  a  consequence,  the  secretariat  frequently  requests  financial  and \ntechnical  support  from  bilateral  and  multilateral  donors  for  capacity \nbuilding. \n\nASEAN+3 does not have a formal secretariat: its rotating chair is \nin charge of organizing its agenda and various meetings (Chapter 4). \nBut AMRO, its new regional surveillance unit, will have an estimated \nbudget  of  $3  million  for  its  first  three  years  of  operation,113  with  80% \nsplit  equally  among    the  Plus  Three  countries  and  20%  split  equally \namong ASEAN countries.114 \n\nAs a multilateral development organization that facilitates regional \ncooperation initiatives, ADB\u2019s size and  its staff \u2019s skillset may provide \na  good  approximation  of  the  type  of  mid-sized  institution  that  might \ninitially  be  required  to  create  a  secretariat  for  an  Asian  economic \ncommunity. In 2010, ADB employed around 900 professional staff plus \naround 2,500 national officers and administrative staff. ADB\u2019s operating \nbudget of some $400 million115 provides an order of magnitude of the \npotential cost of institution building in Asia.116 \n\nEventually, a broad and deep regional community might require a \nsecretariat along the lines of the EC. This has an operating budget of \nalmost $3 billion annually, most of which is absorbed by staff salaries. \n\n111  Funding for APEC operations comes from member countries alone. Members\u2019 contributions \n\nto APEC\u2019s secretariat are related to the size of their GDP.\n\n112  In addition to ASEAN\u2019s operating budget, the secretariat manages ASEAN\u2019s various trust \nfunds\u2014amounting to around $300 million in 2008\u2014which are financed by ASEAN\u2019s \ndialogue partners and other donors.\n\n113  This initial budget may have to rise once AMRO reaches the full complement of staff \n\nneeded to fulfill all its functions.\n\n114  In other words, the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea will contribute 26.7% each to \nAMRO\u2019s budget, while contributions from each of the 10 ASEAN countries will be 2%.\n115  This figure does not include consultants\u2019 remuneration, which in 2010 was in the order of \n\n$25 million.\n\n116  Staff salaries make up a large part of these running costs, or approximately 35% of the \n\ntotal (of which 25% is for professional staff). Administrative expenses\u2014communications, \noffice occupancy and supplies, and equipment maintenance and support\u2014represent \napproximately 16.5% of the total, while business travel and representation expenses make \nup around 6% of the total.\n\nPolicy Options\n\n239\n\n\fInstitutions for Regional Integration\n\nThis is only a small fraction of the EU\u2019s total budget, which in 2010 was \naround \u20ac141.5 billion ($195 billion).117\n\nKnowledge  community.  Impetus  for  regional  integration  can \nalso  come  from  the  region\u2019s  think-tanks,  universities,  business \npeople,  professionals,  journalists,  political  and  economic  analysts, \nand other members of civil society. Many welcome the formation of \nan  Asian  identity  and  increasingly  interact  with  regional  colleagues \nthrough professional, educational, and official networks. Their closer \nrelationships  and  collaboration  can  inform  regional  strategies  and \nprovide foundations for strengthening Asia\u2019s IRIs.\n\nfor \nSuch  pan-regional  networks  serve  as  mechanisms \ncommunication,  socialization,  and  information  sharing.  Business \norganizations ought to develop links similar to those that increasingly \nexist  among  academics  and  researchers.  Existing  and  new  IRIs  can \nfacilitate this networking by encouraging greater participation in their \naffairs  by  civil  society  members  who  support  the  goals  of  regional \nintegration. \n\nRegional  integration  and  cooperation  are  knowledge-intensive \nprocesses,  requiring  careful  policy  analysis.  The  region\u2019s  think-tanks \nand  universities  are  ideally  structured  to  conduct  research  and  offer \nadvice:  they  can  focus  on  issues  in  depth  and  over  time.  They  are \nwell positioned to guide integration, provided they work closely with \ngovernments to ensure that their research addresses timely questions \nand receives high-level attention (ADB 2008b). \n\nMost  Asian  countries  have  significant  capabilities  in  their  major \nresearch institutes, at least one of which in each country is typically \nfocused  on  international  economic  issues.  These  institutes  have \nbegun  to  organize  through  regional  networks\u2014such  as  the  Asian \nPolicy Forum, the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research, and the \nNetwork of East Asian Think-Tanks\u2014to share ideas and research. Asia \nis  also  home  to  many  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  research  universities. \nThey  too  are  joining  regional  networks,  such  as  the  Association  of \nEast Asian Research Universities and the ASEAN University Network. \nTheir faculties and students represent exceptional assets for analyzing \nand  debating  regionalism.  Programs  that  involve  leading  centers \nof  learning  can  bring  powerful  intellectual  resources  to  bear  on  the \nsubject of regionalism, and help mobilize future leaders for the long-\nterm project of building a regional community. The University of the \nSouth  Pacific,  for  instance,  was  established  more  than  40  years  ago \n\n117  Using a euro\u2013dollar exchange rate of 1.375 as on 16 March 2010.\n\n240\n\n\fto  promote  higher  learning  in  the  Pacific  region.  More  recently,  the \nSouth Asia University was set up to promote the idea of regionalism \nand facilitate people-to-people exchange in South Asia, sponsored by \nSAARC member states. The research group established by ASEAN+3 to \nanalyze regional cooperation issues among its 13 members, especially \nin macroeconomics and finance, is also helping to advance the idea of \na knowledge community in Asia. \n\nAll of these efforts have a purpose: to work toward the vision of \nan  Asian  economic  community  characterized  by  deeply  integrated \nmarkets  in  goods  and  services,  deep  and  liquid  regional  financial \nmarkets  more  resilient  to  financial  crises,  more  closely  coordinated \nmonetary  and  fiscal  policies  that  enhance  macroeconomic  and \nexchange-rate  stability  and  facilitate  global  rebalancing,  and  lower \nlevels of poverty and income disparity. Ultimately, it is about building \na  more  integrated  Asia,  free  of  poverty  and  conflict,  prosperous  and \nconfident,  and  well  equipped  to  shape  its  destiny\u2014and  that  of  the \nworld\u2014for the better. \n\nPolicy Options\n\n241\n\n\fReferences \n\nAbe,  Shigeyuki.  2009.

They feel that while cooperation on \ntrade  and  finance  is  progressing,  more  needs  to  be  done  to  provide \neconomic  infrastructure  and  regional  public  goods  in  areas  such  as \nthe environment, health, and regional security. They believe that Asia \nneeds to strengthen its institutions for regional integration in order to \npromote  closer  cooperation  and  deeper  economic  integration.  They \nare keener on strengthening and consolidating existing institutions than \non creating new ones. They also provide specific recommendations on \nhow to move towards an Asian economic community in the long run. \nThe survey was conducted between 21 January and 12 February \n2010, using a stratified sample of 3,027 opinion leaders from 19 countries \nin Asia and the Pacific.1 The country distribution was based on a weighted \naverage  of  the  size  of  its  population  and  its  gross  domestic  product. \n\n1 \n\n In order to increase the likelihood of response, the survey questionnaire was designed to take \nno more than 10\u201315 minutes. Questions were formulated in a simple way, with background \ninformation  provided  where  necessary.  The  English  questionnaire  was  translated  into  six \nlanguages  (Bahasa  Indonesia,  Japanese,  Korean,  Mandarin,  Russian,  and  Vietnamese)  to \nfacilitate understanding from a broad spectrum of respondents. Interviews were conducted \nonline  with  the  help  of  TNS  Global  Market  Research,  a  well-known  surveying  firm;  once \n1,000 responses had been collected, the survey was closed. A complete discussion of results \nof the survey is included in Capannelli (2010).\n\n262\n\n\fPerception Survey of Opinion Leaders in Asia: Summary\n\nThe sample was organized into five subregions and four categories, as \nshown in Table A1.1. Around 77% of the 1,000 respondents are based \nin East Asia (i.e., either Southeast or Northeast Asia), followed by South \nAsia (16.8%), the Pacific and Oceania (3.8%), and Central Asia (2.4%). \nBusiness  leaders  account  for  40%  of  respondents  and  government \nofficials  for  34%,  followed  by  academics  (18%)  and  opinion  leaders \nfrom the media and nongovernment organizations (8%).\n\nTable A1.1.

They think regional integration is positive for Asian \neconomies  as it speeds up their development  and could  give  Asia  a \nmore coordinated and stronger voice in international forums. As well \nas  offering  an  alternative  to  global  multilateral  institutions,  regional \nintegration  is  perceived  as  helping  to  reduce  poverty  and  improve \nsocial indicators (Figure A1.1).\n\nFigure A1.1.

The question was: Rate the costs and \nbenefits for your country of strengthening economic relations with other countries in Asia and \nthe Pacific.\n\nSource: ADB (2010).\n\nAmong the costs associated with regionalism, Asian opinion leaders \nare most concerned about a potential widening of the divide between \nthe  rich  and  the  poor.  This  may  happen  because  the  opportunity  of \nbenefiting from stronger regional economic ties is unevenly distributed \nwithin countries, but it can be mitigated by regional measures, such as \nimproving infrastructure.\n\nOther  perceived  costs  of  regionalism \n\nloss  of \nindependence  over  national  economic  policies  and  an  erosion \nof  competitive  advantages  over  neighboring  countries  as  national \nstandards  are  harmonized  or  mutually  recognized.2  Closer  regional \nintegration  might  also  weaken  the  region\u2019s  economic  links  with \nnon-Asian  countries,  respondents  fear,  and  erode  national  culture \n\ninclude  a \n\n264\n\n2 \n\nIn Figure A1.2 these two costs are listed together.\n\n\fPerception Survey of Opinion Leaders in Asia: Summary\n\nand  identity.  Overall,  though,  opinion  leaders  believe  the  benefits  of \nregional economic integration far outweigh the costs.\n\nAsia\u2019s  opinion  leaders  believe  that  infrastructure  projects  to \nimprove  connectivity  and  establish  energy  links  offer  the  biggest \nbenefits,  followed  by  the  creation  of  a  region-wide  free  trade  and \ninvestment  area.  Regional  dialogues  on  macroeconomic  policy, \nfinancial sector development, the provision of regional public goods, \nand  security  issues  are  also  listed  as  highly  beneficial,  followed  by \nmechanisms  to  coordinate  monetary  and  exchange-rate  policies. \nFigure  A1.2  lists  such  functional  areas  in  order  of  importance,  as \nsuggested  by  opinion  leaders.  These  findings  are  consistent  with \nthe results of the 2007 ADB survey. While the 2010 survey included a \nwider range of opinion leaders from a broader range of countries, their \nfindings are remarkably similar.3 \n\nFigure A1.2.

A \nbroad  consensus  agrees  that  existing  regional  institutions  should  be \nstrengthened\u2014by national agencies delegating more powers to them, \nincreasing their financial resources, and improving their governance\u2014\nand  streamlined  by  consolidating  existing  arrangements  into  region-\nwide ones, defining a clearer division of labor among similar institutions, \nand  eliminating  unnecessary  functional  duplications.  Around  half  of \nopinion leaders believe that new IRIs should be created where gaps \nexist  or  where  existing  institutions  are  inefficient  or  ineffective.  Two \nareas where new institutions are deemed to be urgently needed are \nfor  the  provision  of  regional  public  goods  and  the  development  of \nregional infrastructure.\n\nMore  than  four  in  five  respondents  suggested  creating  an  Asian \neconomic community as the long-term objective of regional integration. \n\nFigure A1.3.

Enhancing \ndialogue to coordinate macroeconomic and financial policies is also \npopular across subregions. Enhancing the dialogue on monetary and \nexchange-rate policy and the creation of a regional security zone were \nhigh  in  the  list  of  preferences  (Figure  A1.4).  Creating  a  monetary  or \na  political  union  received  considerably  less  support.  Around  30%  of \nrespondents felt a political union was undesirable or highly so, while \n35% were neutral.\n\nFigure A1.4.

The question was: Thinking of your long-term vision for regionalism, rate the desirability of \nvarious integration objectives among countries in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nSource: ADB (2010).\n\nAt a subregional level, creating an economic community is seen \nas a high priority in Southeast and South Asia, perhaps partly because \nthe  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  and  the  South \nAsian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  have  been \npromoting  similar  ideas.  Opinion  leaders  from  Central  Asia  and  the \nPacific  consider  creating  an  economic  community  a  low  priority.  In \nCentral Asia they were more interested in establishing a security zone, \nwhile in the Pacific the priority is a free trade and investment area. \n\n267\n\n\fAppendix 1\n\nThe  realization  of  these \n\nlong-term  objectives  requires  the \nenhancement  of  existing  institutions  and  the  creation  of  new  ones. \nAs  Figure  A1.5  shows,  opinion  leaders  believe  that  the  following \nIRIs need to be created (in descending order of priority): a financial \nstability  dialogue;  a  region-wide  free  trade  and  investment  area;  an \nAsian monetary fund; a pan-Asian infrastructure forum; and an Asian \nsecretariat for economic cooperation.4 \n\nFigure A1.5.

Opinion \nleaders perceive the CMIM as a way to strengthen regional cooperation and integration and \ncomplement the International Monetary Fund\u2019s activities in Asia.\n\n268\n\n\fPerception Survey of Opinion Leaders in Asia: Summary\n\nOpinion  leaders  provided  detailed  suggestions  on  how  specific \nIRIs  might  be  enhanced.  They  believe  that  it  is  a  pressing  priority \nthat  the  ASEAN,  SAARC,  and  Pacific  Islands  Forum  (PIF)  secretariats \nimprove  their  governing  principles  and  decision-making  structures, \nincrease their financial and human resources, receive a much stronger \nmandate  and  delegated  powers  from  their  national  stakeholder \nagencies,  and  reach  out  more  actively  out  to  the  global  community \nby strengthening relations with non-members (Figure A1.6). They also \nbelieve that ASEAN should urgently strengthen its links with national \ninstitutions and agencies, reform budget contributions (moving away \nfrom  equal  contributions  to  ones  proportional  to  member  countries\u2019 \ngross domestic product), create a regional bureaucracy, and introduce \npermanent staff positions.\n\nFigure A1.6.

In 1994 APEC\u2019s objective was strengthened after APEC \nleaders adopted the Bogor Goals that aim for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific.

Other projects include the proposed creation of a broad marine ecoregion to make \nBIMP-EAGA a regional food basket and ecotourism destination. \n\nOperations\n\nhistory\n\nBIMP-EAGA was launched on 24 March 1994 in Davao City, Philippines, after leaders of Brunei Darussalam, \nIndonesia, and Malaysia responded favorably to a proposal from then Philippine President Fidel Ramos to create an \neconomic and diplomatic initiative consisting of border areas among the four nations. At its inception, areas covered \nby BIMP-EAGA were the entirety of Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia\u2019s federal states of Sabah and Sarawak and the \nfederal territory of Labuan, the islands of Mindanao and Palawan in the Philippines, and the provinces of East and \nWest Kalimantan and North Sulawesi in eastern Indonesia. Indonesia later included all provinces in Kalimantan and \nSulawesi, the Maluku island chain, and Irian Jaya.

Projects aim to help member \ncountries to face threats and pressures on island and ocean systems. Activities include country visits, \nworkshops, and training on biodiversity and conservation, climate change, coastal management, \nenvironmental awareness, pollution and solid waste management, and sustainable land management.\n\nhistory\n\nThe proposal to establish a Pacific environmental organization was raised after a workshop on environmental conservation was \nheld in 1969 in Noumea, New Caledonia. Consequently, in 1973 a small conservation program was established in Noumea, \nwhich later evolved into SPREP. SPREP was established in 1982 within the Secretariat of the Pacific Community in Suva, Fiji \nIslands. SPREP relocated to Samoa in 1992 and was accorded status as an autonomous regional organization in 1993.\n\nLinks\n\nwww.sprep.org/\n\n309\n\n\fAppendix 2\n\nSouth Pacific Tourism Organisation\n\nMember Countries\n\n1.

Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. \nDespite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: \n1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than \n$1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. \n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\nISBN\nPublication Stock No. BKK090359\n\n978-92-9092-210-0\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nI\n\n \n\nN\nS\nT\nI\nT\nU\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\nF\nO\nR\nR\nE\nG\nO\nN\nA\nL\n\nI\n\n \n\n \nI\n\nN\nT\nE\nG\nR\nA\nT\nI\nO\nN\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nT\no\nw\na\nr\nd\na\nn\nA\ns\ni\na\nn\nE\nc\no\nn\no\nm\ni\nc\n \nC\no\nm\nm\nu\nn\ni\nt\ny\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["INSTITUTIONS FOR \nREGIONAL INTEGRATION\nToward an Asian Economic Community\n", "\u00a9 2010 Asian Development Bank\n", "All rights reserved.
