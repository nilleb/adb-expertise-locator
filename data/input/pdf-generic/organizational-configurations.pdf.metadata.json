The idea is to organize in a way that best suits that, and, increasingly, the attention has turned to classifying \ndifferent forms of organizational structure and exploring their implications. However, instead of form (structure) \nfollowing function (work tasks), bureaucracies normally fill positions.5 \nAt the heart of any organization are the persons who produce its products and deliver its services. They \nare its operating core. Next, all but the simplest organization require at least one full-time manager,6 who \noccupies what might be called the strategic apex\u2014from where the organization is overseen. Then, typically, as \norganizations grow, they add more managers who manage \noperators and their managers, forming a middle line between  A corporation doesn\u2019t have a culture.

Most organizations will also have support staff who provide diverse internal services, for instance \nregarding travel, information systems and technology, or external relations. Finally, every organization has an \nideology\u2014a culture that infuses the structure and sets it apart from others, sometimes a little, sometimes very \nmuch. The following figure depicts how these six basic parts may be thought as influencers; it suggests also that \nentities outside the organization exert influence to affect the decisions and actions it takes. The role of this task \nenvironment is crucial but often poorly understood.\nFigure 1: Internal and External Influencers of an Organization\n \nSource: Henry Mintzberg. 1989. Mintzberg on Management: Inside Our Strange World of Organizations. \nSimon and Schuster.\n4  Rules, policies, and procedures are applied across the hierarchy to dictate behavior. Activity is organized in subunits (working groups, \noffices, or departments) where people perform specialized functions. Those who carry out similar tasks are often clustered together.\n5  Bureaucratic ways of organizing limit or work against learning. It is possible for groups to \u201clearn their way out\u201d toward more effective work \nrelationships\u2014those in which responsibility and arrangements for work rest primarily with people who deliver it. Although the principle is \nsimple, unlearning bureaucratic behavior can be extremely difficult.\n6  Whether this manager functions primarily as a supervisor ordering the work of subordinates or as a leader undertaking strategic high-level \nsupport roles for the group depends on the organizational culture. Without mindfulness, most organizations create complex, inefficient \nhierarchies of command.\n2", "On Organizational Configurations\nThe members of the operating core will pull to professionalize to minimize the influence others may have \nover their work. Naturally, the strategic apex will exert its pull to lead, if only to retain control over decision \nmaking by direct supervision. In their search for autonomy, \nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the degree \nthe middle line will balkanize the structure and concentrate \nto which we are influenced by those we \npower through vertical decentralization to themselves.

Support staff will collaborate to involve \nthemselves  in  the  central  activity  of  the  organization. \nIdeology, where it exists as a force in organizations, encourages members to pull together. Politics may also \nexist in certain types of organizations\u2014especially when no part dominates\u2014and cause people to pull apart. \nTogether, these configurations and the pulls and needs represented by each seem to encompass and integrate a \ngood deal of what is known about organizations. The next figure shows all basic pulls on an organization. When \nconditions favor one of these pulls, the organization will be drawn to design itself in a particular configuration.\nFigure 2: Basic Pulls on the Organization\n \nSource: Henry Mintzberg. 1989. Mintzberg on Management: Inside Our Strange World of Organizations. \nSimon and Schuster.\nHenry Mintzberg saw seven basic configurations. The \u201centrepreneurial organization\u201d is a centralized\u2014\nperhaps autocratic\u2014arrangement typified by a small hierarchy, with power in the hands of a chief executive, \noften  the  founder.  Simplicity,  flexibility,  informality, \nand a sense of mission promote loyalty.

The \u201cdiversified \norganization\u201d is borne of mergers made to combine businesses into larger entities under the label of vertical \nintegration, aiming to exploit synergies. The \u201cprofessional organization\u201d is built less on hierarchy than on \nshared experience, be it a practice, a school, or a hospital; it is more democratic and highly motivated than \nthe \u201cmachine organization,\u201d with lines of authority less clearly set out.

To finish, the \u201cpolitical organization\u201d expresses itself in political games, with conventional \nnotions of concentrated coordination and influence replaced by the play of informal power. However, the truth \nis that one can find all these forms in all organizations. Only truly creative organizations dedicated to continuous \nimprovement and evolution model unique configurations. Drawing from the respective strengths of the seven \ntypes of organizations, these configurations would integrate forces of direction, efficiency, concentration, \nproficiency, learning, cooperation, and competition.7 Differences would often be detected across working \ngroups, offices, or departments as these units create their own configurations.\nFigure 3: Types of Organizations\nSource: Compiled from Henry Mintzberg. 1989.

The decision requires an articulated vision with action to adjust the \nstructure, business processes, and norms resulting in a modified culture. If one wishes to reinforce professional, innovative, or entrepreneurial \ntypes, the actions should come from personnel with management support rather than control. While workers obviously understand their \nwork best, they rarely control the design of structures and business processes to guide it. Contemporary organizational development \nresearch and practice proves that employee-driven approaches are the only way toward sustainable improvements in quality, productivity, \nand staff engagement.\n8  Organizing in myriad purposeful ways is the fundamental characteristic of mankind: from the simple to the complex; people constantly \nstrive to perform in groups what they cannot accomplish individually.\n4", "On Organizational Configurations\npoint; it follows failure when function hiccups, gags, or ceases. However, we still think of organizations in \nmechanistic terms as collections of replaceable parts, including staff, capable of being reengineered. And so, the \nreason the great majority of our organizations misses the future is that we overinvest in what is at the expense \nof what could be. To manage organizations in ways that will make our society manageable, we need to spark \ninnovations in management.\nFurther Reading\nADB. 2009a. Learning for Change in ADB. Manila. ADB.
