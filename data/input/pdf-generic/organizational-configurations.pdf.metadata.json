In many \nparts of the world, human beings now live in an organizational \nworld  from  birth  and  depend  on  centralized  hierarchies  as \ninfants, children, youth, students, citizens, consumers, clients, \nemployers, and employees. A convergence of technological \nand economic factors is reinventing the organizations of the \n21st century;2 but until they take more recognizable shapes, \nsince  most  people  spend  much  of  their  waking  hours  in \nformal organizations, it makes sense to circumscribe the main \ntypologies  of  those  of  the  19th  and  20th  centuries.  With  newfound  understanding,  we \nmay then, among countless opportunities for improvement, moderate the organizational \nconflict they fan, bridge the organizational silos they make happen, appreciate the informal \nauthority  they  write  off,  revive  the  moral  courage  they  dampen,  and  by  so  doing\u2014\nperhaps\u2014help rationalize and fructify our lives.\n\n\u2026 and Their Configurations\nHistorically,  models  for  organizational  rationality  and  efficiency  echoed  religious  or \nmilitary forms. At the turn of the 20th \ncentury,  Taylorism3  (aka  scientific \nmanagement)  guided  industrial  and \ncommercial  organizations.  Today, \nmost  organizations  are  designed  as \nbureaucracies \nin  which  authority \nand  responsibility  are  arranged  in \n\nWe do as much harm holding onto programs \nand people past their natural life span as we \ndo when we employ massive organizational \nair strikes. However, destroying comes at the \nend of life\u2019s cycle, not as a first response.\n\n\u2014Margaret Wheatley\n\n1 \n\n2 \n\nThese Knowledge Solutions celebrate the work of Henry Mintzberg on the subject. See Henry Mintzberg. 1989. \nMintzberg on Management: Inside Our Strange World of Organizations. Simon and Schuster.\nTo  wit,  Thomas  Malone  foresees  that  loose  hierarchies,  democracies,  and  markets  will\u2014along  a  continuum \nof  increasing  decentralization\u2014move  management  styles  for  organizational  structures  from  command-and-\ncontrol to coordinate-and-cultivate. See Thomas Malone. 2004. The Future of Work: How the New Order of \nBusiness Will Shape Your Organization, Your Management Style, and Your Life. Harvard Business School Press.\n\n3  A precedent to industrial engineering, scientific management sought to optimize workflow processes thereby \nimproving  labor  productivity.  Contemporary  management  thinking  critiques  Taylorism  as  deskilling  and \ndehumanizing personnel.\n\nTo manage \norganizations in \nways that will \nmake our society \nmanageable, we need \nto spark innovations \nin management. \nConsider the \norganization in which \nyou work. What \nconfiguration does it \nhave and what does \nthat tell you? What \nmight you do to \nenhance the strengths \nand minimize the \nweaknesses of its \nstructure?\n\n\fKnowledge \nSolutions\n\nhierarchy.4 Yet the joint purpose for which a group exists should be the foundation for everything its members \ndo. The idea is to organize in a way that best suits that, and, increasingly, the attention has turned to classifying \ndifferent forms of organizational structure and exploring their implications. However, instead of form (structure) \nfollowing function (work tasks), bureaucracies normally fill positions.5 \n\nAt the heart of any organization are the persons who produce its products and deliver its services. They \nare  its  operating  core.  Next,  all  but  the  simplest  organization  require  at  least  one  full-time  manager,6  who \noccupies what might be called the strategic apex\u2014from where the organization is overseen. Then, typically, as \norganizations  grow,  they  add  more  managers  who  manage \noperators and their managers, forming a middle line between \nthe operating core and the apex position. As it grows ever \nmore  complex,  the  organization  includes  a  technostructure \nof  analysts;  like  managers,  they  perform  administrative \nduties\u2014specifically, they will plan and coordinate the work \nof others. Most organizations will also have support staff who provide diverse internal services, for instance \nregarding travel, information systems and technology, or external relations. Finally, every organization has an \nideology\u2014a culture that infuses the structure and sets it apart from others, sometimes a little, sometimes very \nmuch. The following figure depicts how these six basic parts may be thought as influencers; it suggests also that \nentities outside the organization exert influence to affect the decisions and actions it takes. The role of this task \nenvironment is crucial but often poorly understood.\n\nA corporation doesn\u2019t have a culture. A \ncorporation is a culture. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so \nhorribly difficult to change.\n\n\u2014Karl Weick\n\nFigure 1: Internal and External Influencers of an Organization\n\n \n\nSource: Henry Mintzberg. 1989. Mintzberg on Management: Inside Our Strange World of Organizations. \nSimon and Schuster.\n\n4  Rules, policies, and procedures are applied across the hierarchy to dictate behavior. Activity is organized in subunits (working groups, \noffices, or departments) where people perform specialized functions. Those who carry out similar tasks are often clustered together.\n5  Bureaucratic ways of organizing limit or work against learning. It is possible for groups to \u201clearn their way out\u201d toward more effective work \nrelationships\u2014those in which responsibility and arrangements for work rest primarily with people who deliver it. Although the principle is \nsimple, unlearning bureaucratic behavior can be extremely difficult.\n\n6  Whether this manager functions primarily as a supervisor ordering the work of subordinates or as a leader undertaking strategic high-level \nsupport roles for the group depends on the organizational culture. Without mindfulness, most organizations create complex, inefficient \nhierarchies of command.\n\n2\n\n\fOn Organizational Configurations\n\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the degree \nto which we are influenced by those we \ninfluence.\n\nThe members of the operating core will pull to professionalize to minimize the influence others may have \nover their work. Naturally, the strategic apex will exert its pull to lead, if only to retain control over decision \nmaking by direct supervision. In their search for autonomy, \nthe middle line will balkanize the structure and concentrate \npower through vertical decentralization to themselves. The \ntechnostructure will endeavor to rationalize by standardizing \nbusiness processes. Support staff will collaborate to involve \nthemselves  in  the  central  activity  of  the  organization. \nIdeology, where it exists as a force in organizations, encourages members to pull together. Politics may also \nexist in certain types of organizations\u2014especially when no part dominates\u2014and cause people to pull apart. \nTogether, these configurations and the pulls and needs represented by each seem to encompass and integrate a \ngood deal of what is known about organizations. The next figure shows all basic pulls on an organization. When \nconditions favor one of these pulls, the organization will be drawn to design itself in a particular configuration.\n\n\u2014Eric Hoffer\n\nFigure 2: Basic Pulls on the Organization\n\n \n\nSource: Henry Mintzberg. 1989. Mintzberg on Management: Inside Our Strange World of Organizations. \nSimon and Schuster.\n\nthe  founder.  Simplicity,  flexibility, \n\nHenry  Mintzberg  saw  seven  basic  configurations.  The  \u201centrepreneurial  organization\u201d  is  a  centralized\u2014\nperhaps autocratic\u2014arrangement typified by a small hierarchy, with power in the hands of a chief executive, \ninformality, \noften \nand  a  sense  of  mission  promote  loyalty.  The  \u201cmachine \norganization\u201d  gains  strength  from  its  technostructure;  it  is \nbest  at  mass  production  and  is  characterized  by  layers  of \nmanagement,  formal  procedures,  sharp  divisions  of  labor, \nand  a  large  number  of  routine  operations. The  \u201cdiversified \norganization\u201d is borne of mergers made to combine businesses into larger entities under the label of vertical \nintegration,  aiming  to  exploit  synergies.  The  \u201cprofessional  organization\u201d  is  built  less  on  hierarchy  than  on \nshared experience, be it a practice, a school, or a hospital; it is more democratic and highly motivated than \nthe  \u201cmachine  organization,\u201d  with  lines  of  authority  less  clearly  set  out.  The  \u201cinnovative  organization\u201d  that \n\nThe only things that evolve by themselves in \nan organization are disorder, friction, and \nmalperformance.\n\n\u2014Peter Drucker\n\n3\n\n\fKnowledge \nSolutions\n\n\u2014Groucho Marx\n\nI won\u2019t belong to any organization that would \nhave me as a member.\n\nburgeoned after the Second World War is often found in new \ntechnology  industries,  which  need  to  innovate  constantly \nand respond quickly to changing markets. In the \u201cmissionary \norganization\u201d that spread from the mid-1970s on, ideology \ncan be so strong that the entire structure is sometimes built \naround it, that is, coordinated through the standardization of norms and reinforced by selection, socialization, \nand indoctrination. To finish, the \u201cpolitical organization\u201d expresses itself in political games, with conventional \nnotions of concentrated coordination and influence replaced by the play of informal power. However, the truth \nis that one can find all these forms in all organizations. Only truly creative organizations dedicated to continuous \nimprovement and evolution model unique configurations. Drawing from the respective strengths of the seven \ntypes  of  organizations,  these  configurations  would  integrate  forces  of  direction,  efficiency,  concentration, \nproficiency,  learning,  cooperation,  and  competition.7  Differences  would  often  be  detected  across  working \ngroups, offices, or departments as these units create their own configurations.\n\nFigure 3: Types of Organizations\n\nSource: Compiled from Henry Mintzberg. 1989. Mintzberg on Management: Inside Our Strange World of Organizations. \nSimon and Schuster.\n\nUshering Organizations of the Future\nYogi  Berra  would  and  did  say:  \u201cIt\u2019s  d\u00e9j\u00e0  vu  all  over  again.\u201d  If  people  establish  and  maintain  organizations \nto do things that are not already being done, it follows that \norganizations will die and materialize in new forms when the \njoint purpose that engendered their birth is no longer being \nsatisfactorily  served.8  Form  follows  function  to  a  certain \n\nLeaders must encourage their organizations \nto dance to forms of music yet to be heard.\n\n\u2014Warren Bennis\n\n7  Organizations can decide to move toward a particular type or types. The decision requires an articulated vision with action to adjust the \nstructure, business processes, and norms resulting in a modified culture. If one wishes to reinforce professional, innovative, or entrepreneurial \ntypes, the actions should come from personnel with management support rather than control. While workers obviously understand their \nwork  best,  they  rarely  control  the  design  of  structures  and  business  processes  to  guide  it.  Contemporary  organizational  development \nresearch and practice proves that employee-driven approaches are the only way toward sustainable improvements in quality, productivity, \nand staff engagement.\n\n8  Organizing in myriad purposeful ways is the fundamental characteristic of mankind: from the simple to the complex; people constantly \n\nstrive to perform in groups what they cannot accomplish individually.\n\n4\n\n\fOn Organizational Configurations\n\npoint; it follows failure when function hiccups, gags, or  ceases.  However, we  still think of organizations in \nmechanistic terms as collections of replaceable parts, including staff, capable of being reengineered. And so, the \nreason the great majority of our organizations misses the future is that we overinvest in what is at the expense \nof what could be. To manage organizations in ways that will make our society manageable, we need to spark \ninnovations in management.\n\nFurther Reading\nADB. 2009a. Learning for Change in ADB. Manila. ADB.
