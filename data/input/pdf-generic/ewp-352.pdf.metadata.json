There  is no  policy  leading  to  inclusive  growth,  and \nmultiple, uncoordinated governing bodies adversely affect the growth of the \nsector. Many regulations are outdated, and there are restrictions and barriers on \nforeign  direct  investment.  While  India  is  among  the  top  10  World  Trade \nOrganization members in service exports and imports, the growth and export of \nservices is less than that of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and exports are \ncompetitive in only a few services and are concentrated in a few markets. Most \nof the poor in India do not have access to basic services such as healthcare and \neducation, and infrastructure is weak so the cost of service delivery is high. \nAlthough India wants to be a knowledge hub, there is no uniformity in the quality \nand  standards  of  education,  and  formal  education  does  not  guarantee \nemployability. Policy measures are suggested for inclusive growth that will also \nenhance India\u2019s global competitiveness in services. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: services, growth, employment, productivity, India \n \nJEL classification: O14, O40, O47, L80, L88 ", "   ", " \nI. OVERVIEW \n \nIn developing countries like India, the service sector can lead to inclusive growth through \nbackward and forward links (Banga 2005), by ensuring equitable access to basic services at low \nprices (Deloitte 2011), by creating employment opportunities, and by developing human capital. \nIndia is among the world\u2019s rapidly growing economies. In 2010, the gross domestic product \n(GDP) grew at 10.6% compared to an average growth rate of 7.5% in emerging and developing \neconomies. Although the growth rate decreased to 7.2% in 2011, it was still higher than the \naverage growth rate of emerging economies (6.2%).1 The service sector has been a major \ncontributor to India\u2019s GDP and to its growth. It is the second largest employer after agriculture. \nIndia\u2019s trade in services has increased overtime, and services account for the largest share in \nIndia\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and outflows.   \n \nThe growth of India\u2019s service sector has drawn global attention. Unlike other countries \nwhere economic growth has led to a shift from agriculture to industries, in India there has been \na shift from agriculture to the service sector. In this respect, India has been considered as an \noutlier among South Asia and other emerging countries (Ansari 1995). Gordan and Gupta \n(2003) and Jain and Ninan (2010) have, however, pointed out that with the rise in per capita \nincome, the share of services in GDP increases. Kochhar et al. (2006) argued that India was a \nnegative outlier in 1981 compared to other emerging markets as the share of services in value \nadded and employment was below that of other countries. After the 1990s, the service sector \ngrew, and in 2000 India became a positive outlier in terms of the share of services in value \nadded but continued to be a negative outlier in terms of its share in employment.  \n \nThe growth in the service sector in India has been linked to the reforms of the 1990s. In \nthe first 3 decades after independence in 1947, India was largely an agrarian economy. The \nservice sector started to grow in the mid-1980s, but growth accelerated in the 1990s when India \ninitiated a series of economic reforms after the country faced a severe balance of payments \ncrisis. Reforms in the service sector were a part of the overall reform program which led to \nprivatization, the removal of FDI restrictions, and streamlining of approval procedures among \nothers.  \n \nExisting literature shows that liberalization and reforms have contributed to the growth of \nthe sector (Chanda 2002, Gordan and Gupta 2003, Jain and Ninan 2010). With economic \ngrowth and the rise in per capita income, demand changed from necessary to discretionary \nconsumption  and  propelled  the  growth  of  services  (McKinsey  &  Company  2007),  and  the \nelasticity of demand for services at high incomes has contributed to the growth of the sector \n(Bhattacharya  and  Mitra  1990,  Gordan  and  Gupta  2003).  Technological  progress  and  the \navailability of highly skilled manpower has led to the growth of services in information and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  and  ICT-enabled  services  (Chanda  2002).  Developed \ncountries now outsource services to developing countries like India, leading to a rise in demand \nfor  services  (Bhagwati  1984,  Hansda  2001).  Significant  government  expenditures  on \ncommunity, social, and personal services have also accelerated growth in the sector (Ansari \n1995).  \n \nSome studies have pointed out barriers to growth in services including lack of decent \nemployment (Basu and Maertens 2007), a poor business environment (Joshi 2008), lack of an \nintegrated service sector policy (Banga 2005), and a strong focus on skill-intensive services and \n                                                 \n1   International Monetary Fund (2012).

Classification and Governance  \n \nThe service sector can be classified either by using the country\u2019s own definition or by using the \nUnited Nations Central Product Classification (UNCPC). The UNCPC is used as a basis for \ninternational  negotiations  like  those  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO).  In  India,  the \nNational  Industrial  Classification  provides  classifications  for  services.  Since  the  sector  is \nevolving, both have undergone changes. At present, the National Industrial Classification 2008 \nis used (Box 1) though there are differences between it and the UNCPC, e.g., construction is \nnot a part of the sector in India while it is in the UNCPC.  \n \n \nBox 1: Services Included in the Service Sector in the National Industrial \nClassification 2008 \n \n\uf0b7  Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles \n\uf0b7  Transportation and storage \n\uf0b7  Accommodation and food service activities \n\uf0b7  Information and communication \n\uf0b7  Financial and insurance activities \n\uf0b7  Real estate activities \n\uf0b7  Professional, scientific, and technical activities \n\uf0b7  Administrative and support services \n\uf0b7  Public administration and defense; compulsory social security \n\uf0b7  Education \n\uf0b7  Human health and social work activities \n\uf0b7  Arts, entertainment, and recreation \n\uf0b7  Other service activities \n\uf0b7  Activities  of  households  as  employers;  undifferentiated  goods  and  services  producing  activities  of \nhouseholds for own use \n\uf0b7  Activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies \n \nSource: Extracted from National Industrial Classification 2008, http://mospi.nic.in/Mospi_New/upload/nic_2008_17apr09.pdf\n \n \n \nDisaggregated data for many services are not available.

Multiple ministries and central government departments regulate services such as \nenergy and transport while others like construction and retail do not have nodal ministries. \nServices like telecommunications have one independent regulator while others like electricity \nhave  state  regulators  as  well.

It is expected \nthat the high productivity is largely driven by telecommunications since the postal service in \nIndia is still a government monopoly that suffers from over-employment.   \n \n                                                 \n8   KLEMS refer to growth accounting with capital, labor, energy, material, and services.  \n9   Baumol\u2019s cost disease occurs when there is a productivity lag or low productivity growth due to the nature of the \nservices. \n10  The study is by researchers at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. This is a \nwork in progress and findings of the project are not in the public domain. ", "8   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 352 \nIt  is  difficult  to  compare  different  studies  on  productivity  in  services  due  to \ninconsistencies in the data and in classifications; however, the broad findings show that TFP in \nthe service sector has been the highest and that communication services are one of the major \npropellers of growth in sector productivity in India.  \n \nE.  Future Growth  \n \nIndia\u2019s economic growth slowed to 6.9% in 2012; nevertheless, it is projected to grow at 7.3% in \n2013 which is higher than the 6% average projected growth rate for emerging and developing \n11\neconomies.  In the past decade with the rise in GDP and per capita incomes, the number of \npeople below the poverty line has declined. McKinsey & Company (2007) forecast that if the \nIndian economy grows at the rate of 7.3% between 2005 and 2025, then by 2025, 583 million \nIndians will be in the middle class which is the equivalent of the current population of Australia. \nThe share of the middle class in the total population will increase from around 5% in 2005 to \n41% in 2025, and they will account for 59% of the country\u2019s total consumption. With the \nincrease in incomes, there has also been an increase in the literacy rate which is expected to \nimprove further.12 Moreover, India has one of the youngest populations in the world with 54% \nbelow 25 years of age.13 All this is leading to a change in consumption patterns with an increase \nin demand for discretionary services like education, private healthcare providers, personal care, \nand hotels and restaurants. The Indian market is large and unsaturated, and most services have \nbeen opened up for foreign investment. India wants to be a knowledge-based hub, and the \ngovernment is promoting exports of services. All these factors will drive the future growth of the \nservice sector.   \n \nIndian  government  projections  show  that  the  sector  will  grow  at  a  fast  pace.  The \nPlanning Commission estimates that the economy will grow at 9.5% in the 12th Five Year Plan \n(2012\u20132017), and the service sector is projected to grow at the rate of 10%. Certain services \nlike trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communications, financing, insurance, and \nreal estate are expected to grow faster than the sector overall while others like community, \nsocial, and personal services may grow at a slower pace.  \n \n \nII. ASSESSING THE OPENNESS OF THE SERVICE SECTOR \n \nReforms and liberalization along with technological developments; the growth of multinationals; \nnew delivery models; and a large, unsaturated domestic market have enhanced India\u2019s trade \nand investment in services.  \n \nA.  Trade  \n \nIn the post-reform period (1991\u20132008), India\u2019s trade in services recorded substantial growth as \nthe country became globally competitive in ICT services which increased exports many fold and \nled  to  an  increase  in  India\u2019s  trade  surplus  (Alejandro  et  al.  2010).  Service  exports  have \ncontributed to inclusive economic growth by increasing the number of well-paid jobs and by \nreallocating  labor  to  a  high-productivity  sector.  Service  exports  have  also  increased  tax \nrevenues and have stimulated domestic demand, including demand for infrastructure. \n                                                 \n11   World Economic Outlook August 2012. \n12  As per the United Nations Development Programme (2009), between 1980 and 2007, there has been an increase \nin adult literacy of 25% and in combined gross school enrolment of 20%. \n13  For details see http://nrhm-mis.nic.in/UI/Public%20Periodic/Population_Projection_Report_2006.pdf ", "The Service Sector in India   \u0406   9 \nExisting literature shows that there have been changes in the composition of trade from \ntraditional services such as travel and transport toward knowledge-based and business services \n(Chanda 2002) and that India has export potential in skill-based and labor-intensive services \n(Ministry of Finance 2007).  \n \nTrade in services has been growing rapidly in the past 2 decades. In the 1980s it was \nvalued at $6 billion and in 2010, it reached $240 billion. India\u2019s service exports not only grew \nmore rapidly than the country\u2019s merchandise exports, they also grew faster than global service \nexports. From 1980 to 2010, India\u2019s service exports grew at a CAGR of 13.2% while world \nexports of services grew at the rate of 7.84%. A substantial part of this growth (21.7%) was in \nthe post-reform period (1991\u20132010).14 In the 1980s and 1990s, India had a negative trade \nbalance in services, but from 2004 on, the balance has been positive. \n \nIn the 1980s, trade in services contributed to 20% of India\u2019s total trade. In 2010, the \nshare increased to 30.4% compared with the global average of 24%. Trade in services as a \n15\npercentage of GDP increased from 3.2% in 1980 to 13.9% in 2010;  however, this is still low \ncompared to the contribution of the service sector to India\u2019s GDP.  \n \nIndia\u2019s share in world trade in services increased from less than 1% to over 3% between \n1980 and 2010, while its share in goods trade remained constant at 1%. While world trade in \nservices is still dominated by the developed countries, emerging economies like the PRC and \nIndia are now among the top 10 exporters and importers of services among WTO members. In \n2011,  India  was  the  eighth  largest  exporter  while  its  rank  in  importing  services  remained \n16\nseventh. The PRC was the fourth largest exporter of services.      \n \nIndia has both export and import interests in services. With a huge English-speaking, \nskilled work force available at competitive prices, the country has created a niche for itself in \nexporting  knowledge-based  services  but  needs  foreign  investment  and  best  management \npractices in infrastructure services.  \n \nDeveloped countries are the major trading partners for India in services. By country, the \nUS is the largest export destination followed by the UK and other European countries and other \nEnglish speaking countries like Canada. India imports the bulk of its services from Australia, \nFrance, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the UK, and the US. \n \nExport and import trends in different types of services show that from 2000 to 2010, \nfinancial  services  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  34.6%  followed  by  computer  and \ninformation services at 22.6% and insurance services at 20.2%. From 1980 to 2010, exports of \nbusiness services grew at an average annual rate of 12.6% compared to 12% in transport and \n7.6% in travel services. In 2010, computer and information services were 48.5% of India\u2019s total \nservice exports followed by other business services (23.4%), travel (11.4%), transportation \n(10.7%) and financial services (4.9%). Transportation services accounted for around 37.5% of \nIndia\u2019s total imports in 2010. From 1980 to 2010, imports of transportation services grew at an \n17\naverage annual rate of 11.5%.  \n                                                 \n14  Author\u2019s calculation using data obtained from United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) \ndatabase on International Trade\u2014Services  (accessed 2 March 2012). \n15  World Bank World Development Indicators (accessed 12 December 2012). \n16  World Trade Organization. 2012.   \n17  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Database on International Trade\u2014Services (accessed  \n2 March 2012).

Investments  \n \nIn the post-liberalization period, the service sector has attracted significant foreign investment \ndue to the availability of skilled labor at lower wages and the large and unsaturated domestic \nmarket. According to the A.T. Kearney Global Services Location Index, in 2011 India was the \nleading outsourcing destination among 50 countries followed by the PRC. India\u2019s rank is high \ndue to human resources (2nd), but it ranked poorly in terms of business environment (43rd).  \n \n18\nAccording to the A.T. Kearney FDI Confidence Index,  in 2012 India was the second \nmost attractive destination for FDI after the PRC; however, the Inward FDI Performance Index \nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)19 which compares the \nrelative performance of 141 countries in attracting FDI found that India has performed poorly \ncompared  with  other  developing  countries.  In  2010,  India  was  ranked  97th;  comparative \nrankings for Brazil, the PRC, and Mexico were 69th, 79th, and 84th, respectively. Thus, while \nmultinational companies have shown confidence in India, the country has not been able to \nattract much FDI. This may be because the reform program has slowed recently creating \nuncertainties. The Inward FDI Potential Index which evaluates the host country\u2019s ability to attract \nFDI compared with other countries based on selected factors20 shows that India improved its \nranking from 86th in the 1990s to 79th in 2010.

BARRIERS AND REFORMS  \n \nThe analysis in the previous sections shows that the service sector has increasingly contributed \nto India\u2019s GDP, GDP growth, employment, trade, and investment; however, there are some \nconcerns that are preventing the sector from contributing to inclusive growth. First, GDP growth \nhas slowed down which has affected growth in the service sector. Second, the sector has not \nbeen able to create enough employment either in terms of numbers or quality of jobs. Third, \nalthough India has been portrayed as a major exporter of services, the country\u2019s ranking among \nWTO members in service exports is lower than that of the PRC, and India is globally competitive \nin only one industry: computer and information services. Fourth, India has the potential to attract \nFDI, but it has not been successful in doing so. This section discusses some of these key \nbarriers and suggests reforms that will enhance productivity and efficiency and help to attain \ninclusive growth.  \n \n\uf0b7  Service sector focus in policymaking. There is no government policy on how the \nsector can lead to inclusive growth. This is partly because the focus is on agriculture and \nmanufacturing, and the service sector has largely been left to grow on its own. There is \nno nodal ministry for services like retailing while for others like transport and energy \nthere are multiple ministries with conflicting interests. The quasi-federal governance \nstructure  has  led  to  multiple  regulatory  bodies,  numerous  regulations,  and  multiple \nclearance requirements. For example, there are around 13 regulatory bodies for higher \neducation, and each of them functions in isolation.24 There is an urgent need to focus on \nthe service sector and to identify the key barriers faced by different types of services and \nthen to undertake specific reforms. For instance, in road transport, reforms should focus \non  establishing  a  seamless  supply  chain  by  removing  barriers  to  the  interstate \nmovements  of  goods.  This  can  be  done  with  the  help  of  technology  such  as \ncomputerizing check posts at state borders and with regulations such as implementing \nsingle goods and service taxes. \n \nIn the case of industries like energy, various government departments should work \ntogether to design a policy that will facilitate equitable access at affordable prices. The \npolicy should lay down a short-term strategy (5 years coinciding with the 5-year plans) \nand  a  long-term  strategy  (10\u201315  years)  for  development.  A  nodal  agency  can  be \nidentified for each service and given the responsibility to see that the strategies are \nimplemented. To standardize policies across states, the central government can come \nup with model regulations that the state governments can implement. It is important to \nnote that there are disparities in performance across states and that poor states seem to \ndo badly in service infrastructure and in delivering public services like healthcare and \neducation. For inclusive growth, policies have to focus on state-specific requirements.  \n \n\uf0b7  Regulatory  reforms.  Some  regulations  do  not  take  into  account  technological \ndevelopments while others are outdated or do not follow international best practices. In \nareas  like  transportation,  there  is  a  lack  of  comprehensive  regulations  enabling \nintegrated door-to-door service which increases waste in the supply chain. In addition, \nexisting regulations do not take into account the characteristics of new services such as \n                                                 \n24  Working Group Report for Twelfth Five Year Plan on Higher Education, Department of Higher Education. ", "The Service Sector in India   \u0406   13 \ndirect  selling  and  express  delivery.  Lack  of  prescribed  standards  and  common \naccreditation also adversely affect services like construction and education.  \n \nWhile deregulation and removing regulatory barriers are often necessary for service \nsector growth (Hoekman and Mattoo 2011, Jain and Ninan 2010), in India it may not \nnecessarily be true. For example, the privatization of Indian airports led to an arbitrary \nincrease in tariffs prior to the appointment of the Airport Economic Regulatory Authority. \nSince many services have erstwhile been public monopolies, the vested interests of the \ngovernment  and  of  public  sector  units  adversely  affect  performance  as  they  get \npreferential prices in commodities like energy. Moreover, government procurement is not \nalways transparent, e.g., private companies working for the railways have to procure \nmaterials  from  vendors  selected  by  the  railways.  In  many  services,  especially \ninfrastructure, it is often difficult for the private sector to enter and operate due to a lack \nof third party access and of transparent procedures for sharing scare resources among \nother problems. Thus, a lack of regulation is restricting the competition and efficient \nservice provision necessary for inclusive growth.   \n \nPrivatization should be accompanied by appropriate regulations based on global best \npractices. Regulations should be transparent and non-discriminatory, should take into \naccount the evolving nature of the service sector and its links with other sectors, and \nshould support its growth. Procedural hurdles can be removed by implementing one-stop \nclearances for projects and FDI. Monopolies in sectors such as railways and the post \nshould be gradually phased out and at a minimum, commercially delivered services \nshould be privatized. Public Procurement Bill 2011 should be implemented.25 The need \nfor  regulators  in  specific  areas  should  be  examined  and  if  required,  independent \nregulators should be appointed.  \n \n\uf0b7  Removal of FDI restrictions. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand  Development\u2019s  (OECD)  FDI  Restrictive  Index  2010,  India  is  considered  more \nrestrictive than the Republic of Korea and less so than the PRC and Japan (Figure 3) but \nis one of the few countries that has FDI restrictions on services that are hampering its \nability to attract investment and best management practices. \n \nSince the government does not have adequate resources, it is important to encourage \nprivate and foreign investment in the service sector to facilitate inclusive growth. To \nattract  FDI,  the  policy  should  be  transparent,  technology  neutral,  and  should  not \ndistinguish between domestic and foreign companies. To counter any adverse impacts, \nregulations can be in place to monitor the sector.   \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n25   Public Procurement Bill 2011 seeks to regulate any government purchase of more than $90,000 through \ntransparent bidding.

(2010), Table III-1, p. 19 . \n \n \n\uf0b7  Service sector employment and education. Employment opportunities and quality \neducation are both necessary for inclusive growth. There is a skill shortage in ICT and \norganized retail. According to the Electronic and Computer Software Export Promotion \nCouncil, approximately 5,000 people are needed every year to meet the demand of the \nICT industry, but the total available from educational and training institutes is only a third \nof this number. This is leading to a rise in salaries (average salary increase was 11% in \n2012),26 high attrition rates, and a high cost of operations. Studies (Mukherjee and Goyal \n2012) have shown that although employees prefer to work in the formal sector for better \nsalaries  and  job  security,  skill  requirements  are  different,  and  it  is  not  easy  for \nemployees to shift from the informal to the formal sector.  \n \nIn India, the gross educational enrollment ratio is low, and there are wide variations in \nquality  across  institutions.  Degrees  granted  by  some  private  universities  are  not \nrecognized  even  within  India  thus  further  affecting  employability.27 In  many  cases \ncompanies have to invest substantially in training employees. Critics have argued that \nthe government\u2019s education policy and funding have focused on higher education and \nhave neglected primary education (Kochhar et al. 2006). There are reserved seats for \nthe so-called backward classes in higher education but not in primary education; this is \nnot based on income. Also, labor productivity is lower in social services like healthcare \nand education which affects inclusive growth. \n \n                                                 \n26  Hewitt (2012).  \n27  McKinsey (2011). ", "The Service Sector in India   \u0406   15 \nTo create quality employment in the service sector, it is important to encourage growth in \nthe  formal  sector.  The  government  can  work  with  industries  and  with  educational \ninstitutions  in  public\u2013private  partnerships  to  identify  skill  requirements  and  design \nappropriate courses and training programs to facilitate their development. Today, private \norganizations can operate only as not-for-profit institutions in education. The government \nmay consider allowing for-profit education while putting in place a regulatory framework \nto  ensure  that  participants  meet  a  required  standard.  This  will  facilitate  private \ninvestment. Focusing on vocational training and developing appropriate curricula will \nincrease the employability of students in the service sector. The quality of education can \nbe improved through proper accreditation at international standards.   \n \n\uf0b7  Taxes and subsidies. India has a high corporate tax rate of 30%\u201340% compared to \naround 17% in Singapore and up to 25% in the PRC. For commodities like petroleum, \nthere are multiple taxes and levies that vary across states. Sometimes, taxes have \nadverse impacts on the use of the most efficient technologies. For instance, although \nmulti-axle vehicles are more efficient than single-axle vehicles, the motor vehicle tax is \nlevied based on gross vehicle weight rather than on potential axle loads. This results in \nunder-taxation of two-axle trucks. In the Union Budget for FY2012, the government \nproposed  imposing  a  retrospective  tax 28 which  was  sharply  criticized  by  foreign \ninvestors. Cross-subsidization and inappropriate subsidies have led to misallocations of \nresources. In railways the average passenger tariff in India is 55% lower than in the PRC \nwhile the average freight tariff is 66% higher.29 Similarly, while the commercial sector \nhas to pay a higher power tariff, the agriculture sector, irrespective of land size, is highly \nsubsidized. \n \nA number of tax reforms including the pending single goods and service tax and the \nDirect Tax Code Bill of 2010 should be implemented, and cross-subsidies should be \nminimized. For inclusive growth, subsidies should be targeted to the poor and needy. \n \n\uf0b7  Access  and  availability  of  infrastructure. Unlike countries like the PRC, in India \ngovernment investment in infrastructure is low and has not been able to meet demand. \nFor instance, most ICT companies have to invest in power units due to the erratic power \nsupply. This increases their costs. Companies in construction, ICT, hospital services, \nand retail, among others, find it difficult to acquire property due to the lack of urban \nplanning, restrictive zoning regulations, outdated laws related to land conversion, and \nthe  lack  of  clear  ownership  and  titles  to  land.  This  causes  delays  in  project \nimplementation.  In  addition,  due  to  poor  infrastructure  planning,  the  full  benefits  of \nexisting investments cannot be reaped. The government needs to act as a facilitator so \nthat private developers have access to basic facilities like land. There is a need for \nproper urban and infrastructure planning. The focus should not only be on creating new \ninfrastructure but also on efficiently using existing infrastructure. \n   \n                                                 \n28  The government in the 2012 Finance Bill has proposed amendments in the Income Tax Act of 1961 with \nretrospective effect to bring in taxes on net overseas mergers and acquisitions involving Indian assets. \n29  Government of India, Planning Commission (2005).

Both can play key roles in inclusive growth by \nensuring  access  to  cheaper  technology  and  by  disseminating  knowledge.  In  India, \nexpenditures on research and development were low at around 0.8% of GDP in 2012.30 \nThe share in the private sector was only 0.25% of GDP compared to 1.2%\u20132.0% in \nemerging economies. \n \nIn 2010, India had 1.53 Internet subscribers per 100 inhabitants compared to 8.35 in the \nPRC and 35.68 in the Republic of Korea.31 This is a cause for concern as India aspires \nto be a knowledge hub. Due to low ICT penetration, 67% of the revenue is from exports; \nthe domestic market accounts for only 33%.32  \n \nThe  Indian  government  can  encourage  investments  in  research  and  development \nthrough public\u2013private partnerships and through fiscal incentives such as tax benefits, \ngrants, and subsidies. ICT penetration can be increased through appropriate policies like \ntax incentives for setting up broadband infrastructure in rural areas or developing content \nin local languages. Low-cost consumer devices such as laptops, tablets, and personal \ncomputers can support ICT penetration.   \n \n\uf0b7  Trade. India\u2019s trade in services largely comprises computer and software services, and \nexports are concentrated in a few markets. For instance, the US accounted for 56.5% of \ntotal computer software/service exports in FY2009 followed by the European Union at \n31.3%.33 India needs to diversify its export basket and markets. A country cannot sustain \nits global position in trade in services by exporting manpower. Moreover, the movement \nof people is a sensitive issue. If India wants greater market access for the temporary \nmovement of people, it has to remove FDI restrictions on a reciprocal basis. Unless India \nundertakes domestic reforms, it will be difficult to achieve.  \n \n \nIV. CONCLUSIONS AND THE WAY FORWARD \n \nThe service sector is the largest and fastest growing sector in India, it has the highest labor \nproductivity, and it is projected to continue to grow at a fast pace. The share of services in \nIndia\u2019s total trade is higher than the global average, and India is among the top 10 WTO \nmembers in service exports and imports. There are, however, a number of concerns. India does \nnot have a policy that can lead to inclusive growth, and numerous governing bodies and a lack \nof coordination among them adversely affect the growth of the sector. In many types of services, \nthe regulations are outdated, and there are FDI restrictions and regulatory barriers. The sector \nhas not been able to create sufficient employment either in terms of number or quality of jobs. \nIndia\u2019s service sector growth and exports of services are lower than that of competing countries \nlike the PRC, and exports are competitive in a few services only and are concentrated in a few \nmarkets.  There  are  wide  variations  in  the  growth  of  different  types  of  services  and  great \ndisparities in access to services; a major proportion of the poor in India do not have access to \nbasic services such as healthcare and education. Infrastructure is weak, so the cost of service \ndelivery is high. Although India wants to develop as a knowledge hub, there is no uniformity in \nthe quality and standards of education, and formal education does not guarantee employability.   \n \n                                                 \n30  Economic Survey of India 2011\u20132012. \n31  ICT Statistics Database, International Telecommunication Union (accessed 11 May 2012). \n32  Author\u2019s calculation from NASSCOM Strategic Review Report 2012. \n33  Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council.

It  is \nimportant for a developing country like India with a large, young population to generate quality \nemployment  and  to  move  up  the  value  chain.  India  needs  private  investments  in  key \ninfrastructure services such as transport, energy, and telecommunications. It can attract FDI \nand private investment only with a stable, transparent, non-discriminatory, competitive policy \nenvironment. If the reforms suggested here are implemented, they will enhance the productivity \nand efficiency of the service sector and lead to inclusive growth.  \n ", " \nREFERENCES \n \nAlejandro, Lisa, Eric Forden, Allison Gosney, Erland Herfindahl, Dennis Luther, Erick Oh, Joann \nPeterson, Matthew Reisman, and Isaac Wohl. 2010.
