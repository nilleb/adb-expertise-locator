There  is  no  policy  leading  to  inclusive  growth,  and \nmultiple,  uncoordinated  governing  bodies  adversely  affect  the  growth  of  the \nsector. Many regulations are outdated, and there are restrictions and barriers on \nforeign  direct  investment.  While  India  is  among  the  top  10  World  Trade \nOrganization members in service exports and imports, the growth and export of \nservices  is  less  than  that  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  exports  are \ncompetitive in only a few services and are concentrated in a few markets. Most \nof the poor in India do not have access to basic services such as healthcare and \neducation,  and  infrastructure  is  weak  so  the  cost  of  service  delivery  is  high. \nAlthough India wants to be a knowledge hub, there is no uniformity in the quality \nand  standards  of  education,  and  formal  education  does  not  guarantee \nemployability. Policy measures are suggested for inclusive growth that will also \nenhance India\u2019s global competitiveness in services. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: services, growth, employment, productivity, India \n \nJEL classification: O14, O40, O47, L80, L88 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. OVERVIEW \n\n \nIn  developing  countries  like  India,  the  service  sector  can  lead  to  inclusive  growth  through \nbackward and forward links (Banga 2005), by ensuring equitable access to basic services at low \nprices (Deloitte 2011), by creating employment opportunities, and by developing human capital. \nIndia  is  among  the  world\u2019s  rapidly  growing  economies.  In  2010,  the  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) grew at 10.6% compared to an average growth rate of 7.5% in emerging and developing \neconomies.  Although  the  growth  rate  decreased  to  7.2%  in  2011,  it  was  still  higher  than  the \naverage  growth  rate  of  emerging  economies  (6.2%).1 The  service  sector  has  been  a  major \ncontributor to India\u2019s GDP and to its growth. It is the second largest employer after agriculture. \nIndia\u2019s trade in services has increased overtime, and services account for the largest share in \nIndia\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and outflows.   \n\n \nThe  growth  of  India\u2019s  service  sector  has  drawn  global  attention.  Unlike  other  countries \nwhere economic growth has led to a shift from agriculture to industries, in India there has been \na  shift from  agriculture  to  the  service  sector.  In this  respect,  India  has  been  considered  as  an \noutlier  among  South  Asia  and  other  emerging  countries  (Ansari  1995).  Gordan  and  Gupta \n(2003)  and  Jain  and  Ninan  (2010)  have,  however,  pointed  out  that  with  the  rise  in  per  capita \nincome, the share of services in GDP increases. Kochhar et al. (2006) argued that India was a \nnegative outlier in 1981 compared to other emerging markets as the share of services in value \nadded  and  employment  was  below  that  of  other  countries. After  the  1990s,  the  service  sector \ngrew,  and  in  2000  India  became  a  positive  outlier  in  terms  of  the  share  of  services  in  value \nadded but continued to be a negative outlier in terms of its share in employment.  \n\n \nThe growth in the service sector in India has been linked to the reforms of the 1990s. In \nthe  first  3  decades  after  independence  in  1947,  India  was  largely  an  agrarian  economy.  The \nservice sector started to grow in the mid-1980s, but growth accelerated in the 1990s when India \ninitiated  a  series  of  economic  reforms  after  the  country  faced  a  severe  balance  of  payments \ncrisis.  Reforms  in  the  service  sector  were  a  part  of  the  overall  reform  program  which  led  to \nprivatization,  the  removal  of  FDI  restrictions,  and  streamlining  of  approval  procedures  among \nothers.  \n \nExisting literature shows that liberalization and reforms have contributed to the growth of \nthe  sector  (Chanda  2002,  Gordan  and  Gupta  2003,  Jain  and  Ninan  2010).  With  economic \ngrowth  and  the  rise  in  per  capita  income,  demand  changed  from  necessary  to  discretionary \nconsumption  and  propelled  the  growth  of  services  (McKinsey  &  Company  2007),  and  the \nelasticity  of  demand  for  services  at  high  incomes  has  contributed  to  the  growth  of  the  sector \n(Bhattacharya  and  Mitra  1990,  Gordan  and  Gupta  2003).  Technological  progress  and  the \navailability  of  highly  skilled  manpower  has  led  to  the  growth  of  services  in  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  and  ICT-enabled  services  (Chanda  2002).  Developed \ncountries now outsource services to developing countries like India, leading to a rise in demand \nfor  services  (Bhagwati  1984,  Hansda  2001).  Significant  government  expenditures  on \ncommunity,  social,  and  personal  services  have  also  accelerated  growth  in  the  sector  (Ansari \n1995).  \n \nSome  studies  have  pointed  out  barriers  to  growth  in  services  including  lack  of  decent \nemployment (Basu and Maertens 2007), a poor business environment (Joshi 2008), lack of an \nintegrated service sector policy (Banga 2005), and a strong focus on skill-intensive services and \n\n                                                 \n1  \n\nInternational Monetary Fund (2012).  \n\n\f2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 352 \n\nClassification and Governance  \n\nhigher  education  while  a  majority  of  the  population  remains  unskilled  and  poorly  educated \n(Kochhar et al 2006).  \n \nA. \n \nThe service sector can be classified either by using the country\u2019s own definition or by using the \nUnited  Nations  Central  Product  Classification  (UNCPC).  The  UNCPC  is  used  as  a  basis  for \ninternational  negotiations  like  those  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO).  In  India,  the \nNational  Industrial  Classification  provides  classifications  for  services.  Since  the  sector  is \nevolving, both have undergone changes. At present, the National Industrial Classification 2008 \nis  used  (Box  1)  though  there  are  differences  between  it  and  the  UNCPC,  e.g.,  construction  is \nnot a part of the sector in India while it is in the UNCPC.  \n \n \n\nBox 1: Services Included in the Service Sector in the National Industrial \nClassification 2008 \n\nTransportation and storage \n\nInformation and communication \nFinancial and insurance activities \n\n \n\uf0b7  Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Accommodation and food service activities \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0b7  Real estate activities \n\uf0b7  Professional, scientific, and technical activities \n\uf0b7  Administrative and support services \n\uf0b7  Public administration and defense; compulsory social security \n\uf0b7  Education \n\uf0b7  Human health and social work activities \n\uf0b7  Arts, entertainment, and recreation \n\uf0b7  Other service activities \n\uf0b7  Activities  of  households  as  employers;  undifferentiated  goods  and  services  producing  activities  of \n\nhouseholds for own use \n\n\uf0b7  Activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies \nSource: Extracted from National Industrial Classification 2008, http://mospi.nic.in/Mospi_New/upload/nic_2008_17apr09.pdf \n\n \n\n \n \nDisaggregated data for many services are not available. Government departments such \nas the Central Statistical Organisation and the National Sample Survey Organisation under the \nMinistry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and the Reserve Bank of India have been \ntrying to collect and collate disaggregated data; however,  since services such as retailing and \nconstruction  are  largely  in  the  non-corporate  (informal  or  unorganized)  sector,  there  is  both \nmisreporting and under-reporting.  \n\n \nIndia has a quasi-federal governance structure; some services are under the jurisdiction \nof the central government (Union List), some are under the state governments (State List) and \nthe  remaining  are  under  the  joint  administration  of  central and  state  governments  (Concurrent \nList) (Box 2). Multiple ministries and central government departments regulate services such as \nenergy  and  transport  while  others  like  construction  and  retail  do  not  have  nodal  ministries. \nServices  like  telecommunications  have  one  independent  regulator  while  others  like  electricity \nhave  state  regulators  as  well.

It has been argued that employment growth has not kept pace with income growth \nin the sector (Bosworth and Maertens 2010) or with the rise in its share of GDP (Kochhar et al. \n2006). Furthermore, the change in the production structure from agriculture to services has not \nbeen reflected by a proportionate change in the occupational structure (Bhattacharya and Mitra \n1990). As a result, service-led growth has been jobless growth (Banga 2005).  \n\n \nTable  3  shows  that  in  FY1993,  close  to  63%  of  the  population  was  engaged  in \nagriculture while  22% worked  in services  (in both  the  formal  and  informal  sectors).  Over  time, \nthe percentage of people employed in agriculture has declined and employment in services has \nincreased, although agriculture continues to have the highest share. Within services, there has \nbeen  a  change  in  the  pattern  of  employment.

Finance,  insurance,  real  estate,  and  business  services  and \ncommunity, social, and personal services largely provide organized employment while retail and \nwholesale trade largely provide unorganized employment.  \n\n \nA  large  part  of  the  organized  employment  in  services  is  concentrated  in  the  public \nsector; in fact, in FY1993, around 86% of the total was in the public sector, but by FY2009 it had \ndeclined to 75%. Trade, hotels, and restaurants are the only activities in which the share of the \npublic sector is less than that of the private sector.  \n\nLabor Productivity  \n\n \nOverall, employment in the service sector in India is lower than its share in GDP, but it is \ngrowing.  The  sector  has  the  largest  share  of  organized  employment,  but  within  services,  the  \norganized share is small with the public sector dominating. The private sector has not been very \nsuccessful in creating organized service sector employment.  \n \nD. \n \nIt  is  difficult  to  do  a  productivity  analysis  in  India  since  data  on  total  employment  are  not \ncalculated  on  a  yearly  basis  and  a  great  deal  of  employment  in  services  is  informal.  Existing \nstudies  have,  however,  concluded  that  labor  productivity  has  been  the  highest  in  the  service \nsector,  particularly  in  the  decades  after  1980.  Using  output  data  from  National  Accounts \nStatistics and employment data from other secondary sources, Bosworth and Maertens (2010) \nfound that total factor productivity (TFP) was highest in service sector (Table 4). \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n7   The  organized  sector  consists  of  registered  companies  or  units.  These  are  professionally  managed  with \n\ntransparent accounting systems and follow government regulations and legislation such as labor laws. \n\n\fThe Service Sector in India   \u0406   7 \n\nTable 4: Total Factor Productivity for Major Sectors in India, 1980\u20132006 \n(%) \n \n\nSector \nTotal Economy \nAgriculture \nIndustry \nServices \n\n1980\u20131990\n2.2 \n1.9 \n1.5 \n2.1 \n\n1990\u20132000\n1.8 \n0.7 \n0.6 \n3.1 \n\n2000\u20132006\n2.1 \n0.9 \n1.6 \n1.9 \n\n Source: Extracted from Bosworth and Maertens (2010), Table 2.3, p. 119. \n\n  \n \nEichengreen and Gupta (2010) used the National Accounts Statistics and cross-country \ndata  from  the  European  Union  (EU)  KLEMS8 and  showed  that  the  skill  content  in  both  the \nmanufacturing  and  service  sectors  is  increasing  over  time.  The  authors  divided  the  service \nsector  into  three  groups  (Table  5)  and  pointed  out  that  productivity  growth  was  the  highest  in \nGroup  3.  Within  this  group,  the  fastest  growing  types  are  business  services,  communications, \nand banking, and growth in exports has contributed to the growth of most services.

Economy-wide  estimates \nrecorded an annual labor productivity growth rate of around 4.5% from 1980 to 2008 while the \ngrowth  rates  in  labor  productivity  for  services,  agriculture,  and  manufacturing  were  3.52%, \n1.94%,  and  5.45%,  respectively.  The  study  further  found  that  labor  productivity  rates  for \nservices increased from 2.69% per annum from 1980 to 1999 to 6% from 2000 to 2008 due to \ngrowth  in  post  and  telecommunications,  hotels  and  restaurants,  and  trade.  Healthcare  and \nsocial work, other services, and education registered lower rates which is a cause for concern. \n\n \nThe  outcome  of  this  study  suffers  from  a  lack  of  disaggregated  data.  For  instance,  it \ndoes not distinguish between growth in telecommunications and postal services.

McKinsey  &  Company  (2007)  forecast  that  if  the \nIndian economy grows at the rate of 7.3% between 2005 and 2025, then by 2025, 583 million \nIndians will be in the middle class which is the equivalent of the current population of Australia. \nThe  share  of  the  middle  class  in  the  total  population  will  increase  from  around  5%  in  2005  to \n41%  in  2025,  and  they  will  account  for  59%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  consumption.  With  the \nincrease in incomes, there has also been an increase in the literacy rate which is expected to \nimprove  further.12 Moreover,  India  has  one  of  the  youngest  populations  in  the  world  with  54% \nbelow 25 years of age.13 All this is leading to a change in consumption patterns with an increase \nin demand for discretionary services like education, private healthcare providers, personal care, \nand hotels and restaurants. The Indian market is large and unsaturated, and most services have \nbeen  opened  up  for  foreign  investment.  India  wants  to  be  a  knowledge-based  hub,  and  the \ngovernment is promoting exports of services. All these factors will drive the future growth of the \nservice sector.   \n \nIndian  government  projections  show  that  the  sector  will  grow  at  a  fast  pace.  The \nPlanning Commission estimates that the economy will grow at 9.5% in the 12th Five Year Plan \n(2012\u20132017),  and  the  service  sector  is  projected  to  grow  at  the  rate  of  10%.  Certain  services \nlike trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communications, financing, insurance, and \nreal  estate  are  expected  to  grow  faster  than  the  sector  overall  while  others  like  community, \nsocial, and personal services may grow at a slower pace.  \n\n \n \nII. ASSESSING THE OPENNESS OF THE SERVICE SECTOR \n \nReforms and liberalization along with technological developments; the growth of multinationals; \nnew  delivery  models;  and  a  large,  unsaturated  domestic  market  have  enhanced  India\u2019s  trade \nand investment in services.  \n \nA. \n \nIn the post-reform period (1991\u20132008), India\u2019s trade in services recorded substantial growth as \nthe country became globally competitive in ICT services which increased exports many fold and \nled  to  an  increase  in  India\u2019s  trade  surplus  (Alejandro  et  al.  2010).  Service  exports  have \ncontributed  to  inclusive  economic  growth  by  increasing  the  number  of  well-paid  jobs  and  by \nreallocating  labor  to  a  high-productivity  sector.  Service  exports  have  also  increased  tax \nrevenues and have stimulated domestic demand, including demand for infrastructure. \n\nTrade  \n\n                                                 \n11   World Economic Outlook August 2012. \n12   As per the United Nations Development Programme (2009), between 1980 and 2007, there has been an increase \n\nin adult literacy of 25% and in combined gross school enrolment of 20%. \n\n13   For details see http://nrhm-mis.nic.in/UI/Public%20Periodic/Population_Projection_Report_2006.pdf \n\n\fThe Service Sector in India   \u0406   9 \n\nExisting literature shows that there have been changes in the composition of trade from \ntraditional services such as travel and transport toward knowledge-based and business services \n(Chanda  2002)  and  that  India  has  export  potential  in  skill-based  and  labor-intensive  services \n(Ministry of Finance 2007).  \n\n \nTrade in services has been growing rapidly in the past 2 decades. In the 1980s it was \nvalued  at  $6  billion  and  in  2010,  it  reached  $240  billion.  India\u2019s  service  exports  not  only  grew \nmore rapidly than the country\u2019s merchandise exports, they also grew faster than global service \nexports.  From  1980  to  2010,  India\u2019s  service  exports  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  13.2%  while  world \nexports of services grew at the rate of 7.84%. A substantial part of this growth (21.7%) was in \nthe  post-reform  period  (1991\u20132010). 14 In  the  1980s  and  1990s,  India  had  a  negative  trade \nbalance in services, but from 2004 on, the balance has been positive. \n\n \nIn  the  1980s,  trade  in  services  contributed  to  20%  of  India\u2019s  total  trade.  In  2010,  the \nshare  increased  to  30.4%  compared  with  the  global  average  of  24%.  Trade  in  services  as  a \npercentage of GDP increased from 3.2% in 1980 to 13.9% in 2010;15 however, this is still low \ncompared to the contribution of the service sector to India\u2019s GDP.  \n\n \nIndia\u2019s share in world trade in services increased from less than 1% to over 3% between \n1980  and  2010,  while  its  share  in  goods  trade  remained  constant  at  1%.  While  world  trade  in \nservices  is still  dominated  by  the  developed  countries,  emerging  economies  like  the  PRC  and \nIndia are now among the top 10 exporters and importers of services among WTO members. In \n2011,  India  was  the  eighth  largest  exporter  while  its  rank  in  importing  services  remained \nseventh. The PRC was the fourth largest exporter of services.16     \n\n \nIndia  has  both  export  and  import  interests  in  services.  With  a  huge  English-speaking, \nskilled  work  force  available  at  competitive  prices,  the  country  has  created  a  niche  for  itself  in \nexporting  knowledge-based  services  but  needs  foreign  investment  and  best  management \npractices in infrastructure services.  \n\n \nDeveloped countries are the major trading partners for India in services. By country, the \nUS is the largest export destination followed by the UK and other European countries and other \nEnglish  speaking  countries  like  Canada.  India  imports  the  bulk  of  its  services  from  Australia, \nFrance, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the UK, and the US. \n\n \nExport  and  import  trends  in  different  types  of  services  show  that  from  2000  to  2010, \nfinancial  services  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  34.6%  followed  by  computer  and \ninformation services at 22.6% and insurance services at 20.2%. From 1980 to 2010, exports of \nbusiness services grew at an average annual rate of 12.6% compared to 12% in transport and \n7.6% in travel services. In 2010, computer and information services were 48.5% of India\u2019s total \nservice  exports  followed  by  other  business  services  (23.4%),  travel  (11.4%),  transportation \n(10.7%) and financial services (4.9%). Transportation services accounted for around 37.5% of \nIndia\u2019s total imports in 2010. From 1980 to 2010, imports of transportation services grew at an \naverage annual rate of 11.5%.17 \n\n                                                 \n14   Author\u2019s calculation using data obtained from United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) \n\ndatabase on International Trade\u2014Services  (accessed 2 March 2012). \n15   World Bank World Development Indicators (accessed 12 December 2012). \n16   World Trade Organization. 2012.   \n17   United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development  Database  on  International  Trade\u2014Services  (accessed  \n\n2 March 2012). \n\n\f10   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 352 \n\nTo  understand  the  pattern  of  specialization  in  service  trading  and  whether  or  not  the \nsector  in  India  is  globally  competitive,  the  revealed  comparative  advantage  (RCA)  was \ncalculated  using  Balassa\u2019s  index  (Balassa  1965).

According  to  the  A.T.  Kearney  Global  Services  Location  Index,  in  2011  India  was  the \nleading  outsourcing  destination  among  50  countries  followed  by  the  PRC.  India\u2019s  rank  is  high \ndue to human resources (2nd), but it ranked poorly in terms of business environment (43rd).  \n\n \nAccording  to  the  A.T.  Kearney  FDI  Confidence  Index,18 in  2012  India  was  the  second \nmost attractive destination for FDI after the PRC; however, the Inward FDI Performance Index \nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)19 which compares the \nrelative  performance  of  141  countries  in  attracting  FDI  found  that  India  has  performed  poorly \ncompared  with  other  developing  countries.  In  2010,  India  was  ranked  97th;  comparative \nrankings  for  Brazil,  the  PRC,  and  Mexico  were  69th,  79th,  and  84th,  respectively.  Thus,  while \nmultinational  companies  have  shown  confidence  in  India,  the  country  has  not  been  able  to \nattract  much  FDI.  This  may  be  because  the  reform  program  has  slowed  recently  creating \nuncertainties. The Inward FDI Potential Index which evaluates the host country\u2019s ability to attract \nFDI  compared  with  other  countries  based  on  selected  factors20 shows  that  India  improved  its \nranking from 86th in the 1990s to 79th in 2010. Thus, India has the potential to attract more FDI \n                                                 \n18   The index is based on a survey of senior executives of multinational companies from 25 countries and shows the \n\npresent and future prospects for FDI.

In the 1980s, India received $0.08 billion in FDI \nwhich increased to $42.5 billion in 2008 and then declined due to the global slowdown to $24.6 \nbillion  in  2010.  Cumulative  FDI  equity  inflows  were  $179  billion  from  April  2000  to  August \n2012.21 In  2009,  India\u2019s  share  of  worldwide  FDI  was  2.44%,  up  from  0.15%  in  the  1980s; \nhowever, India\u2019s share declined to 1.98% in 2010.22 The bulk of FDI in India is routed through \nMauritius. Other important investing countries include Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the US. \n\n \nAt present, FDI is allowed in most but not all services in the sector (Table 7). In the post-\nliberalization period, the overall sector has been the largest recipient of FDI with a share of over \n50%  between  2000  and  2011.

BARRIERS AND REFORMS  \n \nThe analysis in the previous sections shows that the service sector has increasingly contributed \nto  India\u2019s  GDP,  GDP  growth,  employment,  trade,  and  investment;  however,  there  are  some \nconcerns that are preventing the sector from contributing to inclusive growth. First, GDP growth \nhas slowed down which has affected growth in the service sector. Second, the sector has not \nbeen  able  to  create  enough  employment  either  in  terms  of  numbers  or  quality  of  jobs.  Third, \nalthough India has been portrayed as a major exporter of services, the country\u2019s ranking among \nWTO members in service exports is lower than that of the PRC, and India is globally competitive \nin only one industry: computer and information services. Fourth, India has the potential to attract \nFDI,  but  it  has  not  been  successful  in  doing  so.  This  section  discusses  some  of  these  key \nbarriers  and  suggests  reforms  that  will  enhance  productivity  and  efficiency  and  help  to  attain \ninclusive growth.  \n \n\uf0b7 \n\nService  sector  focus  in  policymaking.  There  is  no  government  policy  on  how  the \nsector can lead to inclusive growth. This is partly because the focus is on agriculture and \nmanufacturing, and the service sector has largely been left to grow on its own. There is \nno  nodal  ministry  for  services  like  retailing  while  for  others  like  transport  and  energy \nthere  are  multiple  ministries  with  conflicting  interests.  The  quasi-federal  governance \nstructure  has  led  to  multiple  regulatory  bodies,  numerous  regulations,  and  multiple \nclearance requirements. For example, there are around 13 regulatory bodies for higher \neducation, and each of them functions in isolation.24 There is an urgent need to focus on \nthe service sector and to identify the key barriers faced by different types of services and \nthen to undertake specific reforms. For instance, in road transport, reforms should focus \non  establishing  a  seamless  supply  chain  by  removing  barriers  to  the  interstate \nmovements  of  goods.  This  can  be  done  with  the  help  of  technology  such  as \ncomputerizing  check  posts  at  state  borders  and  with  regulations  such  as  implementing \nsingle goods and service taxes. \n \nIn  the  case  of  industries  like  energy,  various  government  departments  should  work \ntogether to design a policy that will facilitate equitable access at affordable prices. The \npolicy should lay down  a short-term strategy (5  years coinciding with the 5-year plans) \nand  a  long-term  strategy  (10\u201315  years)  for  development.  A  nodal  agency  can  be \nidentified  for  each  service  and  given  the  responsibility  to  see  that  the  strategies  are \nimplemented.  To  standardize  policies  across  states,  the  central  government  can  come \nup  with  model  regulations  that  the  state  governments  can  implement.  It  is  important  to \nnote that there are disparities in performance across states and that poor states seem to \ndo  badly  in  service  infrastructure  and  in  delivering  public  services  like  healthcare  and \neducation. For inclusive growth, policies have to focus on state-specific requirements.  \n \nRegulatory  reforms.  Some  regulations  do  not  take  into  account  technological \ndevelopments while others are outdated or do not follow international best practices. In \nareas  like  transportation,  there  is  a  lack  of  comprehensive  regulations  enabling \nintegrated  door-to-door  service  which  increases  waste  in  the  supply  chain.  In  addition, \nexisting regulations do not take into account the characteristics of new services such as \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n                                                 \n24   Working Group Report for Twelfth Five Year Plan on Higher Education, Department of Higher Education. \n\n\fThe Service Sector in India   \u0406   13 \n\ndirect  selling  and  express  delivery.  Lack  of  prescribed  standards  and  common \naccreditation also adversely affect services like construction and education.  \n \nWhile  deregulation  and  removing  regulatory  barriers  are  often  necessary  for  service \nsector  growth  (Hoekman  and  Mattoo  2011,  Jain  and  Ninan  2010),  in  India  it  may  not \nnecessarily  be  true.  For  example,  the  privatization  of  Indian  airports  led  to  an  arbitrary \nincrease in tariffs prior to the appointment of the Airport Economic Regulatory Authority. \nSince many services have erstwhile been public monopolies, the vested interests of the \ngovernment  and  of  public  sector  units  adversely  affect  performance  as  they  get \npreferential prices in commodities like energy. Moreover, government procurement is not \nalways  transparent,  e.g.,  private  companies  working  for  the  railways  have  to  procure \nmaterials  from  vendors  selected  by  the  railways.  In  many  services,  especially \ninfrastructure, it is often difficult for the private sector to enter and operate due to a lack \nof third party access and of transparent procedures for sharing scare resources among \nother  problems.  Thus,  a  lack  of  regulation  is  restricting  the  competition  and  efficient \nservice provision necessary for inclusive growth.   \n \nPrivatization  should  be  accompanied  by  appropriate  regulations  based  on  global  best \npractices.  Regulations  should  be  transparent  and  non-discriminatory,  should  take  into \naccount  the  evolving  nature  of  the  service  sector  and  its  links  with  other  sectors,  and \nshould support its growth. Procedural hurdles can be removed by implementing one-stop \nclearances  for  projects  and  FDI.  Monopolies  in  sectors  such  as  railways  and  the  post \nshould  be  gradually  phased  out  and  at  a  minimum,  commercially  delivered  services \nshould be privatized. Public Procurement Bill 2011 should be implemented.25 The need \nfor  regulators  in  specific  areas  should  be  examined  and  if  required,  independent \nregulators should be appointed.  \n \nRemoval of FDI restrictions. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand  Development\u2019s  (OECD)  FDI  Restrictive  Index  2010,  India  is  considered  more \nrestrictive than the Republic of Korea and less so than the PRC and Japan (Figure 3) but \nis  one  of  the  few  countries  that has  FDI  restrictions  on  services  that are  hampering  its \nability to attract investment and best management practices. \n \nSince  the  government  does  not  have  adequate  resources,  it  is  important  to  encourage \nprivate  and  foreign  investment  in  the  service  sector  to  facilitate  inclusive  growth.  To \nattract  FDI,  the  policy  should  be  transparent,  technology  neutral,  and  should  not \ndistinguish between domestic and foreign companies. To counter any adverse impacts, \nregulations can be in place to monitor the sector.   \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n25   Public  Procurement  Bill  2011  seeks  to  regulate  any  government  purchase  of  more  than  $90,000  through \n\ntransparent bidding. \n\n\f14   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 352 \n\nFigure 3: Foreign Direct Investment Index for Selected Countries, 2010 \n \nEquity Restrictions\n\nTotal Foreign Direct \nInvestment Index\n\nScreening\n\n0.50\n\n0.40\n\n0.30\n\n0.20\n\n0.10\n\n0.00\n\nOperational Restrictions\n\nKey Personnel\n\nPRC\n\nIndia \n\nJapan\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\n \n\nPRC = People's Republic of China. \n\nThe closer the score is to zero, the more open the economy.

(2010), Table III-1, p. 19 . \n\nNotes: \n\n \n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nService  sector  employment  and  education.  Employment  opportunities  and  quality \neducation are both necessary for inclusive growth. There is a skill shortage in ICT and \norganized  retail.  According  to  the  Electronic  and  Computer  Software  Export  Promotion \nCouncil, approximately 5,000 people are needed every year to meet the demand of the \nICT industry, but the total available from educational and training institutes is only a third \nof this number. This is leading to a rise in salaries (average salary increase was 11% in \n2012),26 high attrition rates, and a high cost of operations. Studies (Mukherjee and Goyal \n2012) have shown that although employees prefer to work in the formal sector for better \nsalaries  and  job  security,  skill  requirements  are  different,  and  it  is  not  easy  for \nemployees to shift from the informal to the formal sector.  \n \nIn  India,  the  gross  educational  enrollment  ratio  is  low,  and  there  are  wide  variations  in \nquality  across  institutions.  Degrees  granted  by  some  private  universities  are  not \nrecognized  even  within  India  thus  further  affecting  employability. 27  In  many  cases \ncompanies  have  to  invest  substantially  in  training  employees.  Critics  have  argued  that \nthe  government\u2019s  education  policy  and  funding  have  focused  on  higher  education  and \nhave  neglected  primary  education  (Kochhar  et  al.  2006).  There  are  reserved  seats  for \nthe so-called backward classes in higher education but not in primary education; this is \nnot based on income. Also, labor productivity is lower in social services like healthcare \nand education which affects inclusive growth. \n \n\n                                                 \n26   Hewitt (2012).  \n27   McKinsey (2011). \n\n\fThe Service Sector in India   \u0406   15 \n\nTo create quality employment in the service sector, it is important to encourage growth in \nthe  formal  sector.  The  government  can  work  with  industries  and  with  educational \ninstitutions  in  public\u2013private  partnerships  to  identify  skill  requirements  and  design \nappropriate courses and training programs to facilitate their development. Today, private \norganizations can operate only as not-for-profit institutions in education. The government \nmay consider allowing for-profit education while putting in place a regulatory framework \nto  ensure  that  participants  meet  a  required  standard.  This  will  facilitate  private \ninvestment.  Focusing  on  vocational  training  and  developing  appropriate  curricula  will \nincrease the employability of students in the service sector. The quality of education can \nbe improved through proper accreditation at international standards.   \n \nTaxes  and  subsidies.  India  has  a  high  corporate  tax  rate  of  30%\u201340%  compared  to \naround  17%  in  Singapore  and  up  to  25%  in  the  PRC.  For  commodities  like  petroleum, \nthere  are  multiple  taxes  and  levies  that  vary  across  states.  Sometimes,  taxes  have \nadverse  impacts  on  the  use  of  the  most  efficient  technologies.  For  instance,  although \nmulti-axle vehicles are more efficient than single-axle vehicles, the motor vehicle tax is \nlevied based on gross vehicle weight rather than on potential axle loads. This results in \nunder-taxation  of  two-axle  trucks.  In  the  Union  Budget  for  FY2012,  the  government \nproposed  imposing  a  retrospective  tax 28  which  was  sharply  criticized  by  foreign \ninvestors. Cross-subsidization and inappropriate subsidies have led to misallocations of \nresources. In railways the average passenger tariff in India is 55% lower than in the PRC \nwhile  the  average  freight  tariff  is  66%  higher.29 Similarly,  while  the  commercial  sector \nhas to pay a higher power tariff, the agriculture sector, irrespective of land size, is highly \nsubsidized. \n \nA  number  of  tax  reforms  including  the  pending  single  goods  and  service  tax  and  the \nDirect  Tax  Code  Bill  of  2010  should  be  implemented,  and  cross-subsidies  should  be \nminimized. For inclusive growth, subsidies should be targeted to the poor and needy. \n \nAccess  and  availability  of  infrastructure.  Unlike  countries  like  the  PRC,  in  India \ngovernment investment in infrastructure is low and has not been able to meet demand. \nFor instance, most ICT companies have to invest in power units due to the erratic power \nsupply.  This  increases  their  costs.  Companies  in  construction,  ICT,  hospital  services, \nand  retail,  among  others,  find  it  difficult  to  acquire  property  due  to  the  lack  of  urban \nplanning,  restrictive  zoning  regulations,  outdated  laws  related  to  land  conversion,  and \nthe  lack  of  clear  ownership  and  titles  to  land.  This  causes  delays  in  project \nimplementation.  In  addition,  due  to  poor  infrastructure  planning,  the  full  benefits  of \nexisting investments cannot be reaped. The government needs to act as a facilitator so \nthat  private  developers  have  access  to  basic  facilities  like  land.  There  is  a  need  for \nproper urban and infrastructure planning. The focus should not only be on creating new \ninfrastructure but also on efficiently using existing infrastructure. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n28   The  government  in  the  2012  Finance  Bill  has  proposed  amendments  in  the  Income  Tax  Act  of  1961  with \n\nretrospective effect to bring in taxes on net overseas mergers and acquisitions involving Indian assets. \n\n29   Government of India, Planning Commission (2005). \n\n\f16   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 352 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nResearch  and  development  and  ICT.  Both  can  play  key  roles  in  inclusive  growth  by \nensuring  access  to  cheaper  technology  and  by  disseminating  knowledge.  In  India, \nexpenditures on research and development were low at around 0.8% of GDP in 2012.30 \nThe  share  in  the  private  sector  was  only  0.25%  of  GDP  compared  to  1.2%\u20132.0%  in \nemerging economies. \n \nIn 2010, India had 1.53 Internet subscribers per 100 inhabitants compared to 8.35 in the \nPRC and 35.68 in the Republic of Korea.31 This is a cause for concern as India aspires \nto be a knowledge hub. Due to low ICT penetration, 67% of the revenue is from exports; \nthe domestic market accounts for only 33%.32  \n \nThe  Indian  government  can  encourage  investments  in  research  and  development \nthrough  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  through  fiscal  incentives  such  as  tax  benefits, \ngrants, and subsidies. ICT penetration can be increased through appropriate policies like \ntax incentives for setting up broadband infrastructure in rural areas or developing content \nin  local  languages.  Low-cost  consumer  devices  such  as  laptops,  tablets,  and  personal \ncomputers can support ICT penetration.   \n \nTrade. India\u2019s trade in services largely comprises computer and software services, and \nexports are concentrated in a few markets. For instance, the US accounted for 56.5% of \ntotal  computer  software/service  exports  in  FY2009  followed  by  the  European  Union  at \n31.3%.33 India needs to diversify its export basket and markets. A country cannot sustain \nits global position in trade in services by exporting manpower. Moreover, the movement \nof  people  is  a  sensitive  issue.  If  India  wants  greater  market  access  for  the  temporary \nmovement of people, it has to remove FDI restrictions on a reciprocal basis. Unless India \nundertakes domestic reforms, it will be difficult to achieve.  \n\n \n \nIV. CONCLUSIONS AND THE WAY FORWARD \n \nThe  service  sector  is  the  largest  and  fastest  growing  sector  in  India,  it  has  the  highest  labor \nproductivity,  and  it  is  projected  to  continue  to  grow  at  a  fast  pace.  The  share  of  services  in \nIndia\u2019s  total  trade  is  higher  than  the  global  average,  and  India  is  among  the  top  10  WTO \nmembers in service exports and imports. There are, however, a number of concerns. India does \nnot have a policy that can lead to inclusive growth, and numerous governing bodies and a lack \nof coordination among them adversely affect the growth of the sector. In many types of services, \nthe regulations are outdated, and there are FDI restrictions and regulatory barriers. The sector \nhas not been able to create sufficient employment either in terms of number or quality of jobs. \nIndia\u2019s service sector growth and exports of services are lower than that of competing countries \nlike the PRC, and exports are competitive in a few services only and are concentrated in a few \nmarkets.  There  are  wide  variations  in  the  growth  of  different  types  of  services  and  great \ndisparities in access to services; a major proportion of the poor in India do not have access to \nbasic services such as healthcare and education. Infrastructure is weak, so the cost of service \ndelivery is high. Although India wants to develop as a knowledge hub, there is no uniformity in \nthe quality and standards of education, and formal education does not guarantee employability.   \n\n \n\n                                                 \n30   Economic Survey of India 2011\u20132012. \n31   ICT Statistics Database, International Telecommunication Union (accessed 11 May 2012). \n32   Author\u2019s calculation from NASSCOM Strategic Review Report 2012. \n33   Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council. Statistical Year Book 2009\u20132010. \n\n\fThe Service Sector in India   \u0406   17 \n\nThe  service  sector  will  be  able  to  contribute  to  inclusive  growth  by  enhancing \ninvestment,  creating  employment  and  human  capital,  and  developing  infrastructure.  It  is \nimportant for a developing country like India with a large, young population to generate quality \nemployment  and  to  move  up  the  value  chain.  India  needs  private  investments  in  key \ninfrastructure  services  such  as  transport,  energy,  and  telecommunications.  It  can  attract  FDI \nand  private  investment  only  with  a  stable,  transparent,  non-discriminatory,  competitive  policy \nenvironment. If the reforms suggested here are implemented, they will enhance the productivity \nand efficiency of the service sector and lead to inclusive growth.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAlejandro, Lisa, Eric Forden, Allison Gosney, Erland Herfindahl, Dennis Luther, Erick Oh, Joann \nPeterson,  Matthew  Reisman,  and  Isaac  Wohl.  2010.

India\u2019s exports are competitive in only a few services \nand are concentrated in a few markets. The study identifies the barriers to inclusive growth of the service sector \nand makes policy recommendation to enhance global competitiveness of the sector and develop India as a \nknowledge hub. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.7 billion people who \nlive on less than $2 a day, with 828 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed \nto reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, \nand regional integration.\n \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
