Crises  in  emerging  market  and  developing  economies  tend  to  be  more \ncomplicated  than  those  faced  by  advanced  economies  because  they  are  twin  crises: \nfinancial  and  currency  crises.  Such  crises  require  the  development  of  a  comprehensive \nstrategy covering the stabilization of the domestic financial market and the foreign exchange \nmarket,  closely  coordinated  responses  by  different  government  bodies,  an  extraordinary \neffort  for  financial  restructuring,  and  the  introduction  of  a  new  regulatory  framework.  This \neffort  should  be  based  on  an  effective  crisis  management  team  of  experts  given  a  clear \nmandate with well defined power; strong political support; effective communication with the \nmarket players, both domestic and foreign; and sufficient mobilization of public funds. In this \nregard, this paper emphasizes the importance of building a reliable information base, prompt \nactions,  orchestrating  political  consensus,  and  a  balanced  approach  to  restructuring  and \nregulation among different types of financial institutions. The paper also highlights the need \nfor  a  new  international  financial  architecture  matching  the  rapid  integration  into  the  global \nmarket of the financial markets of emerging and developing economies while their currency \nremains non-convertible. \n\n \nJEL Classification: E58, G01, G18, G21, G28, F34, F36, N20, O16 \n\n \n\n\fCho \n\nADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\nContents \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................ 1 \n\nThe Role of the State in Crisis Prevention ................................................................. 2 \n\n2.1  Monetary Policies, Asset Prices, and Macro-Prudential Regulation .................. 3 \n2.2  Options Available to Emerging Market Economies for the Stability of Currency \n\nMarkets ............................................................................................................. 6 \n2.3  Early Warning System ...................................................................................... 7 \n\n3. \n\nThe role of the state in crisis containment .................................................................. 8 \n\n3.1  Coordination of Policy Responses .................................................................... 9 \n3.2  Liquidity Support ............................................................................................. 10 \n3.3  Government Guarantees ................................................................................ 11 \n3.4  Effective Communications and Building Confidence ....................................... 13 \n\n4. \n\nThe Role of State Interventions in Crisis Resolution ................................................ 13 \n\n4.1  Consolidating the Crisis Resolution Team ....................................................... 14 \n4.2  Developing Crisis Resolution Strategies ......................................................... 15 \n4.3  Diagnosis of Bank Conditions ......................................................................... 16 \n4.4  Mobilizing Public Funds .................................................................................. 17 \n4.5  Resolving Insolvent and Capital-Deficient Banks ............................................ 17 \n4.6  Management of Nationalized Banks and Privatization ..................................... 19 \n4.7  Resolving Non-Bank Financial Institutions ...................................................... 20 \n4.8  Dealing with Impaired Assets .......................................................................... 20 \n4.9  Strengthening the Regulatory Framework ....................................................... 22 \n\n5. \n\nLessons and Conclusion .......................................................................................... 22 \n\nInformation ...................................................................................................... 23 \n5.1 \n5.2  Political Support .............................................................................................. 23 \n5.3  Prompt Government Action ............................................................................. 24 \n5.4  Balanced Approach to Strengthening Regulation ............................................ 24 \n5.5  Macro-Prudential Regulation: Coordination Between Monetary and Supervisory \nPolicies ........................................................................................................... 25 \n\n5.6  Conflicts of Interests: Problem of Regulatory Authority Being a Main Driver of \n\nCrisis Resolution ............................................................................................. 25 \n5.7  New International Financial Architecture ......................................................... 25 \n\nReferences ......................................................................................................................... 27 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nCho \n\nHistorically,  no  industry  has  been  as  heavily  intervened  in  by  the  state  as  the  financial \nindustry (Haber and Perotti 2008). State intervention has been pervasive in most developing \ncountries  as  well  as  in  many  now  advanced  economies.  Financial  industry  was  a  vehicle \nthrough which the state executed its industrial policies (policy-based lending), mobilized war \nfinance, and financed fiscal deficits resulting from its populist polices. Financial industry also \nempowered the government to tame the industrialists by controlling their source of funding. \nCapital  control,  interest  rate  ceilings,  credit  rationing,  and  policy  lending  to  priority  sectors \nhave been common features of state interventions. In many countries, not only policy-based \nbanks but also commercial banks were owned by the state. \n\ntogether  with \n\nThis  state  approach  to  the  financial  sector  has  been  called  \u201cfinancial  repression,\u201d  and  it \nbecame  the  subject  of  criticism  by  many economists,  especially  starting  around the  1970s. \nMcKinnon (1973) wrote one of the seminal works in this regard. Many economists, through \ntheoretical  and  empirical  analyses,  made  persuasive  arguments  on  the  negative  effects  of \nfinancial repression on financial sector development as well as economic growth (Caprio et \nal. 1994; Cho 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990; Fry 1989; McKinnon 1989; Long 1983; World Bank \n1989).  This, \ntechnologies  and  rapid \nglobalization,  has  led  most  countries  to  embark  on  the  liberalization  and  opening  of  their \ndomestic  financial  markets.  Interest  rates  were  deregulated,  policy-based  lending  was \nreduced,  interventions  in  bank  management  and  credit  allocations  (such  as  restrictions  on \nconsumer  loans)  abated,  and,  in  many  cases,  banks  were  privatized.  The  world  also \nwitnessed  the  alleviation  of  capital  controls,  liberalization  of  the  foreign  exchange  system, \nand relaxation of entry barriers to domestic and foreign institutions. These contributed to the \ngrowth of the financial sector and improved the access of households, consumers, and small \nfirms to finance. \n\ninnovations  of \n\ninformation \n\nthe \n\nThe  process  of  financial  liberalization,  however,  has  been  turbulent.  At  the  time  when \nemerging  economies  began  liberalization  and  opening,  they  had  not  established  adequate \ninstitutions and systems for effective prudential regulation  and  supervision. There  was  also \nlack of expertise. At the same time, the amount of foreign capital flowing into these countries \nwas  large  relative  to  the  size  of  their  financial  markets  and  economies.  Although  many \nemerging  economies  started  opening  their  capital  markets  much  later  than  advanced \neconomies,  their  markets  quickly  integrated  into  the  global  market,  as  is  evident  in  the \nshares of foreign investors in their domestic stock markets or banking industries, which were \nmuch  larger  than  in  advanced  economies.  The  combination  of  these  factors  increased  the \nvulnerability  of  these  economies  to  internal  and  external  shocks.  Severe  financial  and \ncurrency  crises  were  experienced  by  Latin  American  countries  in  the  1980s  and  by  Asian \ncountries in the 1990s. \n\nThe United States (US) and Europe are now facing financial crises, but their crises will not \ndevelop into currency crisis because their currencies are international reserve currencies. In \nemerging or developing economies, however, crises usually come as twin crises\u2014financial \nas  well  as  currency  crises.  Such  crises  often  deepen  through  the  balance  sheet  effect  of \ndepreciated  currency.  They  also  complicate  the  government\u2019s  macroeconomic  policy \nresponse. While the US and Europe have used expansive fiscal and monetary policies in the \nface of the financial crisis, developing countries have usually had to use tightened fiscal and \nmonetary  policies  to  cope  with  their  twin  crises.  This  has  deepened  economic  recessions, \naggravated  corporate  cash  flows,  increased  non-performing  loans,  and  further  deepened \nfinancial  crises.  Dealing  with  crises  in  emerging  and  developing  economies  is  thus  a  more \ndaunting and complicated task than dealing with crises in advanced economies. \n\nThis  paper  discusses  the  role  of  state  interventions  in  the  financial  system  for  crisis \ncontainment and resolution (Sections 3 and 4). It also briefly discusses the role of the state \nin  crisis  prevention  (Section  2),  since  crisis  prevention  is  linked  with  containment  and \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nresolution. Discussion of crisis resolution is based largely on the Korean experience during \nthe  1997  Asian \nlessons  and \nrecommendations from the Korean experience of financial crisis resolution (Section 5). \n\nthe  paper  will  draw  some \n\nfinancial  crisis.  Finally, \n\nThe underlying theme of this paper is an old and familiar yet unresolved one: the role of the \ngovernment  versus  the  market  for  a  stable  financial  system  and  economic  growth.  Crisis \ntime calls for extraordinary government interventions in the market, often through the direct \nownership  of  banks  and  non-bank  financial  institutions.  But  these  interventions  need  to \nreduce  conditions  for  moral  hazard  and  the  likelihood  of  a  subsequent  crisis.  They  also \nshould protect the interests of taxpayers, impose losses on the responsible parties, and use \nthe  market  as  much  as  possible  to  pick  the  winners  and  losers.  The  ultimate  objectives  of \ngovernment  interventions  are  to  address failures  and  imperfections  of the  market,  but their \nconstant  exposure  to  the  risk  of  government  failure  must  be  considered  as  well.  When \nmarkets  collapse  in  times  of  crisis,  the  government  is  the  only  remaining  option. \nNevertheless, government interventions should be complemented by market incentives and \nprinciples. \n\n2.  THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN CRISIS PREVENTION \n\nAccess  to  credit  and  finance  is  crucial  for  industrial  development,  smoothing  out \nconsumption, supporting house purchases, international trade, and economic growth. That is \nwhy  the  financial  system  is  called  the  \u201cbloodline\u201d  of  the  economy.  The  financial  market  is \ndifferent from the goods market in that it sells and buys \u201cpromise\u201d and \u201ccredit\u201d (Stiglitz 1989; \nBhagwati 1998). Today\u2019s transactions are always linked to the promise of future delivery. As \nsuch,  the  financial  market  is  more  fragile  than  the  goods  market.  Therefore,  the  state\u2019s \napproach to the financial market has to be different from that toward goods markets. \n\nState  intervention  in  the  financial  sector  has  served  many  purposes:  a  vehicle  of  industrial \nand  social  policies;  a  source  of  power  for  the  state;  cheap  financing  of  fiscal  deficits;  and \nstabilization  of  the  financial  system  and  the  economy.  In  most  countries  where  there  have \nbeen state interventions, they were motivated by a combination of these purposes. \n\nDifferent countries had different priorities in intervening in or regulating the financial sector. \nIn  some  East  Asian  countries,  notably  the  Republic  of  Korea  (hereafter  Korea),  the \ngovernment  intervened  in  the  financial  market  for  industrial  policy  (Amsden  1989;  Chang \n2003;  Cheng  1993;  Cho  1989;  Cho  and  Kim  1997; Woo  1991).  In  South  Asia,  the  highest \npriority  may  have  been  social  policies.  In  Latin  America  it  may  have  been  financing  fiscal \ndeficit.  \n\nOne  common  goal  of  state  intervention  in  all  these  countries,  however,  was  to  ensure  the \nstability  of  the  banking  system.  This  has  been  done  through  imposing  high  entry  barriers, \nrestrictions  on  the  types  of  products  banks  can  deal  with,  and  restrictions  on  deposit  and \nlending  competition,  often  by  adoption  of  interest  regulations.  Arguments  are  divided  on \nwhether these interventions have aided or impeded the growth of financial savings\u2014and, as \na  result,  access  to  finance  by  firms  and  households\u2014and  financial  sector  development. \nSome  argue  that  securing  of  rents  to  the  incumbent  banks  and  maintaining  the  stability  of \nthe  whole  financial  system  contributed  to  the  stability  and  steady  development  of  the \nfinancial  sector  as  well  as  to  the  growth  of  and  access  to  financial  savings  (Cho  1986; \nHellmann, Murdock, and Stiglitz 1997; Aoki, Murdock, and Okuno-Fujiwara 1997). But others \nargue that  it  stifled  competition  and  innovation  in  the financial  sector, thereby  discouraging \nthe growth and development of the financial sector (World Bank 1989; Caprio and Honohan \n2001; Caprio et al. 1994; Fry 1989; Long 1983). The empirical results are mixed, depending \nin  large  part  on  the  extent  of  price  stability  that  a  given  economy  achieved.  However,  it  is \nhard to deny that state interventions (or financial repression) have had some positive effects \non the stability of the financial system by preventing excessive competition. \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\ntoward \n\nIn practice, the line between economic regulation and prudential regulation is thin. Therefore, \nwhen  countries  are  moving \nliberalization  and  removing  economic \nfinancial \nregulations,  they  tend  to  increase  the  risk  of  financial  crisis.  Most  cases  of  homegrown \nfinancial crises in emerging market economies have taken place during or following financial \nderegulation and opening. The East Asian financial crisis in 1997, the financial crisis in the \nNordic  countries  in  the  early  1990s,  and  the  Latin  American  financial  crisis  in  the  1980s \n(Diaz-Alejandro  1985)  were  all  related  to  financial  liberalization  and  opening.  The  US \nsubprime mortgage market debacle and the current global financial crisis are also related to \nfinancial  deregulations  that  have  been  introduced  during  the  last  one  or  two  decades.  The \nseparation  of  commercial  and  investment  banking  businesses  was  relaxed,  regulations  on \nnew products became obscure, and entry barriers were reduced. \n\nThis points to the importance of establishing an effective prudential regulatory system when \na  country  is  moving  toward  greater  opening  and  liberalization  of  its  financial  system.  In \nemerging economies, prudential regulation should cover more dimensions than that in some \nadvanced  economies  whose  currency  is  international  reserve  currency.  Often,  weakness \nand  vulnerability  develops  in  the  foreign  exchange  market.  Large  swings  in  the  exchange \nrate  give  rise  to  big  balance  sheet  effects  on  banks  and  corporate  firms,  which  will  affect \ntheir ability to meet financing needs. Currency and maturity mismatches in foreign currency \nloans should be carefully monitored in these countries, as the international financial market \nis more integrated and new types of interrelated transactions emerge frequently. \n\nThe  importance  of  macroeconomic  stability,  the  introduction  of  proper  rules  and  standards \nfor  supervision,  and  the  building  of  a  proper  institutional  framework  and  infrastructure  for \nregulation cannot be overemphasized. The recent global financial crisis has also highlighted \nthe importance of macro-prudential regulation. It is now generally recognized that actions are \nrequired in five general areas: the regulatory, supervisory, and information perimeter need to \nbe  broadened  to  ensure  that  all  financial  activities  that  pose  systemic  risks  are  adequately \ncaptured;  capital  regulation,  liquidity  management,  and  risk  management  need  to  reflect \nindividual  institutions\u2019  risk  but  also  their  potential  to  form  systemic  risk;  regulatory \napproaches that better dampen the procyclicality of financial markets need to be designed; \ninformation  disclosure  and  corporate  governance  practices  need  to  improve  in  order  to \nenhance market discipline; and greater coordination is needed within and across countries in \nthe design of regulation and the monitoring of systemic crises (Claessens 2009). \n\nThis  paper  will  not  go  into  detail  on  those  policy  and  regulatory  measures  in  preventing \nfinancial crisis.1\n In this section, I will briefly discuss three issues: monetary policies and asset \nprices;  options  available  to  emerging  economies  for  currency  market  stability;  and  the \nestablishment of an early warning system. \n\n2.1  Monetary Policies, Asset Prices, and Macro-Prudential \n\nRegulation \n\nMost financial crises have been caused by the boom and bust of asset markets, especially \nhousing bubbles. Thus, one major policy question is: should the monetary authority respond \nsystematically to inflation in asset markets? \n\nIn many  emerging market  economies,  central  banks  have  adopted  inflation  targeting  as  an \nanchor for their monetary policies during the last one or two decades. The conventional view \nof  inflation  targeting  assigns  no  role  to  asset  prices  in  the  conducting  of  monetary  policy, \nexcept  to  the  extent  to  which  the  changes  in  asset  prices  signal  changes  in  expected \ninflation (Bernanke and Gertler 2000). In line with this view, the authorities should deal with \nasset  price  bubbles  only  as  their  consequences,  if  any,  arise  in  terms  of  the  inflation \n\n                                                \n1 Capital controls, regulatory regimes, and a framework for a macro-prudential approach to systemic risk are the \n\nmain subjects of other papers presented at this conference. \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nobjective,  e.g.,  by  supplying  the  needed  liquidity  in  the  event  of  a  bubble  burst  (Demirguc-\nKunt and Serven 2009). \n\nAn  alternative  view  advocates  a  more  proactive  response  of  monetary  policies  to  asset \nprices. Because asset prices may rise for many reasons, including changes in fundamentals, \nthis  view  holds  that  monetary  policy  should  react  to  deviations  of  asset  prices  from  their \nunderlying  fundamentals  rather  than  deviations  from  any  particular  target  level.  Formally, \nwhile  the  monetary  authorities\u2019  objective  functions  should  continue  to  be  defined  only  in \nterms of goods inflation, their reaction function should include not only inflation forecasts and \nthe  output  gap,  but  also  measures  of  asset  price  misalignment\u2014what  has  been  labeled \n\u201cflexible inflation targeting\u201d (Cecchetti, Genberg, and Wadwhani 2003). \n\nIt is difficult to judge which view is correct. Given the devastating consequences of building \nup  and  bursting  a  bubble  in  the  financial  system  and  the  economy,  the  state  should  take \naction to prevent a bubble from building when danger seems obvious. However, it is difficult \nto judge whether or not asset price increases constitute a bubble. Even though a bubble may \nbe building, it is not easy to spot it in real time when policy action would be most useful to \nprevent it. Also, reacting to a misidentified bubble may entail high costs. Monetary tightening \nin  response  to  an  asset  price  increase  that  has  been  driven  by  improved  economic \nfundamentals will unnecessary contract the economy. If the policy reacts to a bubble once it \nbecomes  evident,  it  may  be  too  late.  The  timing  and  magnitude  of  the  effects  of  monetary \npolicy on asset prices remain uncertain. As a consequence, raising interest rates may be an \nineffective  and  costly  way  of  dealing  with  bursting  bubbles.  The  international  evidence \nsuggests  that  a  very  large  interest  rate  increase  may  be  necessary  to  stabilize  housing \nprices\u2014so  large  as  to  result  in  huge  output  losses  (Assenmacher-Wesche  and  Gerlach \n2008). \n\nThe  political  pressure  not  to  raise  interest  rates  to  contain  an  asset  bubble  is  also  very \nstrong  in  every  country. Even  for  the  central  bank,  which  enjoys  the  highest  independence \nguaranteed  by  law  or  by  tradition,  it  would  not  be  easy  to  stop  the  music  when  a  party  is \ngoing  on.  The  Federal  Reserve  Board  (FRB)  during  the  period  of  2002\u20132006  was  no \nexception (Taylor 2009). \n\nGiven  the  constraints  of  using  monetary  policy  to  contain  an  asset  bubble,  an  alternative \nresponse  would  be  using  regulatory  measures  such  as  loan-to-value  (LTV)  and  debt-to-\nincome  (DTI)  ratios,  or  some  temporary  tax  measures.  The  Korean  government  adopted \nthese  measures  when  it  was  concerned  about  overheating  of  the  housing  market  during \n2003\u20132007.  While  inflation  was  stable  and  there  was  no  significant  output  gap,  it  was  not \ndeemed  to  be  appropriate  to  use  the  interest  policy  to  address  the  rapid  housing  price \nincrease. It was also true in the Korean case that the speculative investments in housing and \nthe  consequent  bubble  were  not  spread  nationwide,  but  were  limited  to  some  popular \nmetropolitan  residential  areas.  In  such  a  case,  the  regulatory  authorities  (Financial \nSupervisory  Commission)  required  lower  LTV  and  DTI  ratios  for  loans  extended  for  home \npurchases  in  those  specific  areas.  In  addition,  the  government  designated  a  number  of \ndistricts in the Seoul metropolitan area where housing prices had increased beyond a certain \npercentage within a year as \u201coverheated areas.\u201d Various tax disadvantages (such as higher \ncapital gains taxes) and fee disadvantages (such as a higher stamp duty rate) were applied \nto these areas. \n\nIt  is  not  clear  to  what  extent  these  measures  helped  to  contain  the  bubble  in  the  housing \nmarket.  But  they  certainly  helped  to  lower  the  vulnerability  of  bank  loans  to  the  risk  of  a \nhousing market collapse. With such measures in place, the average LTV ratio in Korea fell \nbelow 50% (Figure 1). It also appears that such measures have at least partially contributed \nto  containing  the  bubble.  The  authorities  tightened  the  ratios  and  had  direct  control  of  the \nexpansion  of  housing  loans  when  the  housing  price  increased  rapidly  in  late  2006,  and \nsubsequently  housing  prices  in  those  areas  started  to  stabilize.  It  is  possible  that  this \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nstabilization owes to other factors, but it seems clear that such measures provided the initial \nmomentum of the stabilization (Figure 2). \n\nFigure 1: Loan-to-Value Ratio of Banks in the Republic of Korea \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Republic of Korea, March 2009. \n\nFigure 2: Republic of Korea\u2019s Housing Price Index, 2002\u20132008 \n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n \n.\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n \n.\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n\n \n.\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n \n.\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n \n.\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n\n \n.\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n \n.\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n \n.\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n\n \n.\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n \n.\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n \n.\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n\n \n.\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n \n.\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n \n.\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n\n \n.\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n \n.\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n \n.\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n\n \n.\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n \n.\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n \n.\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n\n \n.\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\nNationwide\n\nSeoul area\n\nKangnam area\n\nSource: Korean Statistical Information Service. \n\nAchieving both price stability and financial stability with a single policy tool\u2014that is, interest \nrate  policy\u2014may  not  be  feasible  (Bordo  and  Jeanne  2002).  Thus,  a  combination  of  policy \nmeasures would have to be used to achieve effective macro-prudential regulation. This also \nraises an issue regarding the appropriate mandates of the central bank (Goodhart 2008). In \nmany  emerging market economies,  the  mandate  of the  central  bank  is  limited to  achieving \nthe price stability. Financial stability and the supervision of the banking system fall outside of \nthe  area  of  their  responsibility  in  the  central  bank  law.  This  responsibility  has  been \ntransferred to the financial supervisory authorities or other government bodies. \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\n2.2  Options Available to Emerging Market Economies for the \n\nStability of Currency Markets \n\nMost  emerging  market  and  developing  economies\u2019  currencies  are  non-convertible.  Thus,  a \nsubstantial portion of the firms\u2019 and banks\u2019 transactions as well as assets and liabilities are \ndenominated  in  reserve  currency,  most  notably  in  the  US  dollar.  Current  international \naccounting  rules  require  mark-to-market  on  assets  and  liability  reflecting  the  current \nexchange  rate.  This  means  that  the  balance  sheets  of  big  companies  and  financial \ninstitutions in these countries are highly vulnerable to changes in the exchange rates. When \nthere  is  sharp  depreciation  of  currency  due  to  currency  market  instability,  the  debt  ratio  of \nfirms  and  the  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  banks  are  severely  affected.  This  can  further \ndestabilize the financial and currency markets and may even lead to a crisis. Some call this \nan \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d (Fernandez-Arias and Hausmann 2000) of these countries. But this kind of \nsituation  in  developing  countries  should  be  considered  in  the  revision  of  accounting  rules \nand practices that are later to be accepted internationally. \n\nAdvanced economies have gradually lifted their control on capital flows during the last four \ndecades. During that process, they have established institutions and infrastructure that help \nthe  stability  of  their  financial  systems.  But,  in  most  developing  countries  and  emerging \nmarket  economies,  the  history  of  financial  market  deregulation  and  opening  is  short  and \nsuch  institutions  and  infrastructure  have  not  been  well  established.  Despite  this,  they  are \nmore  integrated  in  the  global  economy  in  terms  of  foreign  banks\u2019  share  in  their  domestic \nbanking industries, foreign investors\u2019 share in their domestic stock markets, and the foreign \ntrade share in their gross domestic products (GDPs) (Figure 3). As a result, they face greater \nvulnerability  to  external  shocks.  Instability  of  the  currency  market  can  easily  develop  into \nwidespread financial crisis in such cases. \n\nFigure 3: Share of Foreign Investors in Stock Markets (2006) \n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n%\n\nKorea = Republic of Korea. \n\nSource: Korea Exchange. \n\nThe  global  financial  market  has  become  integrated  like  a  single  market.  The  currency  of \nmost  emerging  markets  is  non-convertible  while  the  business  of  their  firms  and  banks  is \nincreasingly  integrated  into  the  global  financial  market.  An  increasing  portion  of  the  assets \nand liabilities of their firms and banks is denominated in international currency, especially in \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nthe  US  dollar.  But  international  financial  architecture  is  still  far  from  institutionally  matching \nthe closely integrated financial system. This leaves national governments and central banks \nin  a  helpless  position  when  they  face  dollar  liquidity  problems,  unless  they  hold  a  large \namount of foreign reserves. \n\nThus,  a  new  architecture  for  the  international  monetary  system  is  urgently  needed. \nEstablishment  of  a  global  central  bank  may  be  the  first  best  solution.  But  given  the  reality \nthat it will not be realized in the near future, access to other options should be expanded for \ndeveloping  countries  and  emerging  market  economies.  A  substantial  increase  of  the \nresources coming from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and more ready access to its \nfacility would be helpful. But in order to lessen the reluctance of developing countries to use \nIMF resources, the policy conditionality and its governance structure should be reformed. In \nthe meantime, swap arrangements with the central banks of international reserve currencies \nsuch  as  the  FRB  and  European  Central  Bank  need  to  be  extended  to  emerging  and \ndeveloping  economies  that  are  well  integrated  into  the  global  financial  system  and  have \nsound  macroeconomic  management  records.  Regional  monetary  arrangements  may  be \nanother  option.  In  any  case,  dealing  with  the  problem  of  moral  hazard  will  have  to  be \naddressed in the discussions and the design of the new international financial architecture. \nOtherwise,  emerging  countries  will  have  to  face  increased  risk  of  currency  and  financial \ncrises in the rapidly integrating financial market environment, or they will have to reverse the \nopening  of  their  markets  by  imposing  capital  controls  or  at  least  reducing  the  pace  of \nintegration, which would not be a desirable solution. \n\n2.3  Early Warning System \n\nIt may be helpful to establish an early warning system to prevent crises. This warning system \ncan  be  composed  of  two  parts.  The  first  part  is  models  that  include  not  only  the \nmacroeconomic  model  but  also  sectoral  models.  The  latter  may  encompass  the  housing \nmarket,  foreign  exchange  market,  banking  sector,  stock  market,  and  labor  market.  It  can \nspecify  the  range  of  daily,  weekly,  and  monthly  changes  of  indicators  that  would  require \ndifferent  levels  of  reaction  by  the  government.  The  second  part  is  to  define  the  institutions \nand  meetings  that  are  responsible  for  managing  and  improving  the  model,  monitoring  and \nreporting  the  market  developments,  and  making  the  decision  to  address  specific  market \ndevelopments. \n\nIn Korea, such a system was developed after the 1997 crisis. Initially, it was developed as an \nearly  warning  model,  which  was  basically  a  macroeconomic  model  focused  on  forecasting \nthe  developments  of  the foreign  exchange  market. The  system  was gradually  expanded  to \ninclude  early  warning  models  in  the  housing,  labor,  and  financial  markets.  These  models \nwere  continuously  refined.  In  2004,  the  government  established  a  comprehensive  early \nwarning  system  that  more  clearly  defined  the  responsibility  of  ministries  and  meetings  that \nshould monitor developments in each sector, the level of warning signals, and the reporting \nsystem.  For  instance,  the  Bank  of  Korea  was  responsible  for  monitoring  foreign  exchange \nflows, the Financial Supervisory Committee (FSC) for development of non-performing assets \nof financial institutions, Labor Ministry for the wage level and the situation of worker strikes, \nConstruction  Ministry  for  the  tightness  of  housing  and  land  value  movements,  and  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Economy  for  making  overall  judgments  and  reporting  to  the \nPresident.  Various  levels  of  warning  signal  were  defined:  green  (normal),  blue  (needs \nattention  but  low  risk  of  crisis),  yellow  (needs  attention  with  high  risk  of  crisis),  orange \n(serious  situation),  and  red  (in  crisis). The system  established  a  Round Table  Meeting,  the \ncore members of which were the Minister of Finance and Economy, Governor of the Bank of \nKorea (BOK), Head of the FSC, and the Economic Advisor to the President. These members \nmet  every  week to  check the  market  developments  of the  previous  week.  A  working group \nmeeting  was  also  established  to  support  this  meeting.  In  the  case  of  a  yellow  signal  or \nabove, the Economic Advisor was supposed to report to the President and suggest that the \nPresident call an Economic Policy Deliberation Meeting to be chaired by the President and \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nattended by the members of the Round Table Meeting and other relevant ministers. In that \nmeeting, specific policy reactions were to be determined. \n\nThe advantages of this system were to make the monitoring of market developments part of \nthe  regular  business  of  each  responsible  staff  and  institution,  to  automatically  call  the \nauthorities\u2019  attention  to  market  developments  based  on  the  signal  of  quantified  indicators \n(and,  as  a  result,  to  enable  them  to  consider  proactive  policy  measures),  to  allow  a \ncoordinated  response  by  different  government  bodies,  and  to  keep  the  head  of  the \ngovernment  informed  regarding  developments  in  the  economic  situation.  In  the  case  of \nKorea,  even  without  a  clear  signal  of  crisis,  Economic  Policy  Deliberation  Meetings  were \nheld at least once a quarter to check this early warning system during the period of 2004\u2013\n2007. Although the system was not perfect, it contributed to the sound management of the \neconomy during this period. \n\n3.  THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN CRISIS CONTAINMENT \n\nCrises should be prevented. But once a crisis develops, the government\u2019s job is to contain \nand  resolve  it.  For  successful  resolution  of  a  crisis,  it  is  important  for  the  government  to \nunderstand the nature of the crisis and to have a clear vision about the new system it wishes \nto build from the collapsed system. \n\nThe  1997  crisis  in  Korea,  for  instance,  started  from  widespread  insolvencies  of  big \ncompanies  in  Korea,  which  then  led  to  increasing  non-performing  loans  in  the  domestic \nbanking system. When Thailand\u2019s crisis started to contaminate neighboring countries, Korea \nfell victim to the currency crisis because of its weak financial and corporate sectors and large \nshort-term foreign debts. This intensified the corporate and financial crisis. Thus, while trying \nto stabilize the currency market, the government had to initiate a fundamental corporate and \nfinancial restructuring. Without fundamental restructuring in both the corporate and financial \nsectors,  the  confidence  of  foreign  investors  as  well  as  domestic  depositors  could  not  be \nrecovered.  This  fundamental  restructuring  plan  had  to  be  backed  by  the  introduction  of  a \nnew  regulatory  system, rules, and  standards,  and  also  by  a  very  tight  monetary  policy  that \naimed to stabilize the currency value.2\n\n \n\nIn  2008\u20132009,  Korea  faced  severe  pressure  in  the  currency  market  once  again.  But  this \ntime, the crisis was not homegrown. Korea\u2019s banking system had been well capitalized and \nthe  nonperforming  loan  ratio  was  low.  The  Korean  corporate  sector  also  enjoyed  high \nprofitability  and  a  low  debt  ratio  after  the fundamental  restructuring  of  1997. The  source of \npressure  on  the  Korean  currency  market  was  external.  Thus,  Korean  authorities  took  a \ndifferent  approach.  This  time  the  government  strategy  was  \u201cwaiting  out\u201d  or  \u201cmuddling \nthrough\u201d the crisis. They used expansionary fiscal and monetary policies by cutting interest \nrates sharply, increasing liquidity supports to banks, and forcing extension of credit to small \nand  medium-sized  firms.  In  contrast  to  previous  crises,  these  measures  did  not  deepen \ninstability  in  the  currency  market  because,  this  time,  the  currency  market  pressure  was \nmainly  caused  by  rapid  deleveraging  of  troubled  US  and  European  banks.  Had  Korea \nfollowed  the  same  macroeconomic  policies  it  adopted  during  the  1997  crisis,  the  currency \nmarket instability might have deepened and the risk of financial crisis might have increased. \n\nThis  illustrates  that  depending  on  the  origin,  nature,  and  scope  of  the  crisis,  the  measures \nand  focus  of  government  interventions  should  be  different.  One  of  the  first  things  that  the \ngovernment  has  to  decide  is  its  macroeconomic  policy  response.  In  general,  weakness  of \nthe domestic financial system develops as a result of long-sustained economic recession or \nthe burst of asset bubbles. Facing this situation, the government has to determine whether \nexpansionary  macroeconomic  policies  are  appropriate,  as  they  would  enable  the  financial \nsystem to tide over the weakness, or whether some fundamental restructuring is needed. In \n                                                \n2 The latter policy remains a controversial recipe in the eyes of the IMF. \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nthe  latter  case,  low  interest  rates  and  expansionary  policies  would  give  the  corporate  and \nbanking sectors reason to underestimate the seriousness of their problems and to delay the \nrequired restructuring. Misjudgment of the nature and depth of the crisis ultimately increases \nfiscal costs and adds burden to taxpayers in the form of prolonged economic difficulties. This \nis an interesting subject, but it is beyond the scope of this paper. \n\nAlthough every financial crisis is different, some common factors exist. Every crisis comes to \nthe  surface  as  a  consequence  of  shortage  of  banks\u2019  liquidity.  Their  credit  lines  are  cut  or \nreduced  and  the  revolving  rate  of  their  debts  decreased.  Liquidity  starts  to  dry  up  in  the \ninterbank  market,  and  depositors  start  to  withdraw  their  funds  from  banks  and  non-bank \nfinancial  institutions  (NBFIs).  Runs  also  can  involve  the  withdrawal  of  funds  that  had  been \nplaced  in  off-balance-sheet  instruments  known  as  trust  accounts,  money  desks,  mutual \nfunds, and the like. In developing economies, this can develop simultaneously with shifting of \nlocal  savings  to  foreign  currency  deposits  of  local  banks,  or  to  foreign  controlled  banks. \nCurrency  speculations  become  widespread  and  strong  pressure  builds  up  in  the  currency \nmarket.  Corporate  firms  rush  to  secure  as  much  cash  (both  local  and  foreign  currency)  as \ntheir capacity allows, anticipating that their credit line will be inaccessible in the near future. \nThrough  the  process  of  contagion,  funding  pressures  can  spread  from  the  weakest  to  the \nstrongest banks. \n\nFacing  such  a  situation,  the  government  and  central  bank  are  forced  to  intervene  through \nvarious  means. The central  bank  is the first  line of  defense  in  dealing  with  runs. When the \nefforts  of  the  central  bank  prove  insufficient,  the  government  is  forced  to  step  in.  The \ngovernment in this situation provides a blanket guarantee of bank deposits (sometimes most \nof  the  liabilities  including  foreign  debt),  suspension  of  banks,  nationalization  of  banks,  and \nimposition of temporary capital controls. Concurrent with taking urgent steps to stabilize the \neconomy in crisis, the government needs to lay the foundation for managing the crisis. \n\nIn  this  section,  I  will  discuss  the  issues  related  to  (i)  coordination  of  policy  responses;  (ii) \nliquidity  support;  (iii)  government  guarantees;  and  (iv)  effective  communication  with  the \nmarket. I leave discussion of the measures for resolution of insolvent banks, including capital \ninjections, nationalization, bank restructuring, and privatization, to the next section. \n\n3.1  Coordination of Policy Responses \n\nEffective crisis containment requires effective triage. There should be a clear coordination of \npolicy responses among different government bodies including economic ministries, central \nbank,  and  regulatory  authorities.  It  would  be  ideal  to  organize  a  crisis  management  team \nincluding  these  bodies.  An  early  task  of  the  team  is  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  problems \nfacing individual banks and the overall financial system. An accurate diagnosis is necessary \nto  determine  appropriate  mechanisms  for  stabilizing  the  exchange  market,  resolving \ndistressed banks, determining the amount of support required by banks to be rescued, and \nestimating the aggregate financing needed to resolve the crisis. \n\nIt  is  vital  at  this  stage  to  assure  the  market  that  the  government  is  taking  the  situation \nseriously  and  to  give  confidence  to  the  market  players  that  the  government  is  capable  of \ndealing  with  the  problems.  If  different  views  are  voiced  and  inconsistent  messages  are \nconveyed by different organizations, possibly involving different ministries, the central bank, \nand regulatory bodies, market confidence will be eroded and the crisis will intensify. Thus, it \nis  important  to give the market  a  consistent government  message  with a  single  voice. This \nemergency team should be given a clear mandate with well-defined power, and it is equally \nimportant to endow the team with experts in this area who are well insulated from conflicts of \ninterests.  The  past  crisis  experiences  suggest  that  in  this  early  stage  of  a  crisis,  existing \naccounting  and  regulatory  information  is  substantially  misleading  and  that  the  crisis \nmanagement team will have to devote a large portion of its time to developing and analyzing \na substantial amount of information necessary to support sound decisions. \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n3.2  Liquidity Support \n\n \n\nCho \n\nA financial crisis is typically triggered by runs on banks and flight of funds from the financial \nsystem and from the country. Facing liquidity problems, the central bank, as the first line of \ndefense, is forced to provide liquidity support. It provides liquidity to the overall system or to \nspecific banks. It uses tools such as open market operations, discount window lending, repo \nand reverse repo operations, overdraft lending, and reduced reserve requirements to supply \nliquidity. \n\nAccording  to  Bagehot\u2019s  (1894)  classic  policy  advice,  during  a  systemic  crisis,  the  central \nbank  may  lend  freely  to  solvent  banks,  but  should  minimize  subsidizing  risk  taking  (moral \nhazard),  and  the  loans  are  to  be  made  at  a  penalty  rate  and  only  on  good  collateral.  This \nimplies  that  the  central  bank  should  not  provide  liquidity  to  insolvent  banks  and  those  with \npoor collateral. In order to follow this principle, the central bank must be able to distinguish \nquickly  insolvent  banks  from  those  that  are  solvent  yet  are  facing  liquidity  problems. \nHowever, in the crisis time, the central bank and the government are not often well situated \nto make a fair judgment in this regard due to lack of information. Therefore, if a bank that has \nsystemic importance is facing liquidity problems, the central bank usually provides liquidity at \nthis  stage.  Systemic  importance  usually  has  to  be  determined  by  the  size  of  bank  and  its \ninterconnectedness  with  other  financial  institutions.  But  the  central  bank  may  soon  realize \nthat  its  initial  liquidity  support  is  insufficient  to  stabilize  the  situation.  In  that  case,  the \ngovernment has to step in and issue extensive guarantees to bank liability, and/or suspend \nspecific banks to stop runs.3\n\n \n\nThe  information  problem  is  very  important  at  this  stage.  This  points  to  the  importance  for \nregulators to identify and remedy gaps found in information in non-crisis times. Even though \nthe authorities may have no choice but to provide liquidity support to institutions deemed to \nhave  systemic  importance,  they  should  quickly  start  making  diagnosis  of  the  banks,  and \nbased  on  that,  decisions  should  be  made  as  to  whether  continued  liquidity  support  is \nwarranted. As for the banks that seem unlikely to survive, their business can be suspended, \ntheir assets and liabilities can be transferred to healthier banks, or they can be liquidated or \nnationalized, as will be discussed in the next section. When the government starts to do this, \nit moves to the stage of crisis resolution. \n\nIn  the  case  of  a  foreign  liquidity  crisis,  the  ability  of  the  authorities  to  provide  liquidity  is \nconstrained by the amounts of foreign reserve holdings and swap arrangements with other \ncentral  banks.  Facing  a  run  by  foreign  creditors  and  speculative  currency  dumping,  the \nauthorities  have  to  decide  whether  to  defend  the  currency  or  to  allow  free  floating.  If  the \nauthorities have sufficient foreign reserves that comfortably exceed the amount of short-term \nforeign  debt  plus  foreign  portfolio  investment  and  long-term  debt  falling  due  within  a  year, \ntheir  commitment  to  defend  the  currency  has  credibility.  Otherwise,  they  have  to  reach  a \ncompromise  between  the  goals  of  maintaining  exchange  rate  stability  and  avoiding  a \ncurrency  crisis.  Again,  as  was  mentioned  above,  if  this  crisis  is  homegrown,  a  credible \ndomestic reform program should be framed and announced to support this commitment. If, \ngiven  the  amount  of  foreign  reserves,  the  exchange  rate  depreciation  can  go  beyond  the \nlevel  that  can  be  accommodated  by  domestic  companies  and  financial  institutions,  the \nauthorities should not wait until that happens, but instead ask the IMF for assistance. \n\nDuring the 1997 crisis, Korea\u2019s short-term debt was about seven times the amount of foreign \nreserves.  When  the  Asian  crisis  started  from  Thailand  and  foreign  creditors  started  to  cut \ncredit  lines  and  refuse  revolving  their  loans  to  Korea,  the  Korean  authorities  initially \nattempted  to  provide  guarantees  and  defend  the  currency.  But  when  the  level  of  foreign \nreserves further  declined, the  authorities  lost  credibility.  In  the  end,  the authorities  used  up \nalmost all the usable reserves they had. When this was known to foreign creditors, the run \n                                                \n3 Suspension means that banks are temporarily closed for business, including deposit withdrawals, pending the \n\ndecision regarding their viability. \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nwas uncontrollable, the exchange rate was in a free fall, and the Korean government had no \nchoice  but  had  to  ask  the  IMF  for  a  bailout.  Under  the  IMF  program,  the  domestic  interest \nrate  was  sharply  hiked  to  stabilize  the  exchange  rate,  and  this  deepened  the  domestic \nfinancial  crisis  through  increased  corporate  defaults.  Most  Korean  corporate  firms,  at  that \ntime, were highly leveraged with an average debt-to-equity ratio close to 400%. \n\nIn  the  recent  global  financial  crisis,  with  rapid  deleveraging  of  international  money  center \nfinancial  institutions,  Korea  again  faced  a  sharp  increase  in  capital  outflows  and  mounting \npressure  on  the  Korean  currency.  This  time,  however,  Korea  had  foreign  reserves  larger \nthan the amount of short-term foreign debt. But Korea also had substantial foreign portfolio \ninvestments  in  the  domestic  stock  market,  which  could  leave  the  country  at  any  time.  The \nKorean authorities were more cautious this time in using foreign reserves to defend the won. \nThe  central  bank  occasionally  auctioned  dollars in  the  market to  meet  the  domestic  banks\u2019 \nneed  to  pay  back  foreign  debt  borrowed.  When  the  authorities  saw  the  amount  of  foreign \nreserves fall close to US$200 billion, almost equivalent to the amount of short-term debt and \nlong-term  debt  falling  due  within  a  year,  they  refrained  from  actively  intervening  in  the \ncurrency  market to  defend  the currency. The  Korean  won  depreciated  nearly  50%  within  a \nyear.  The  authorities  were  afraid  that,  if  the  foreign  reserves  fell  below  US$200  billion,  it \ncould  increase  market  anxiety  and  trigger  rapid  capital  outflows.  At  the  same  time,  the \nauthorities  made  swap  arrangements  with  FRB  (US$30  billion),  Bank  of  Japan  (US$10 \nbillion), and People\u2019s Bank of China (US$10 billion) to assuage market anxiety. \n\nUntil  this  crisis,  much  debate  and  criticism  had  been  expressed  regarding  the  building  of \nlarge foreign reserves by emerging market economies because it is seen as costly to them \nand  makes  their  monetary  control  difficult.  If  Korea  had  not  accumulated  such  a  large \namount  of  reserves,  however,  it  might  have  fallen  into  another  currency  crisis.  The  cost  of \nbuilding  up  the  reserves  paid  off,  to  a  large  extent,  during  the  global  financial  crisis.  Even \nKorea\u2019s large foreign reserves, amounting to US$270 billion, which ranked the fifth or sixth \nlargest  in the  world,  were  not  sufficient  to  assuage the  currency market anxiety.  Only  after \nthe swap arrangement with the FRB did the exchange market begin to stabilize. \n\nEmerging market economies and developing countries have been encouraged to open their \nfinancial  markets  by  developed  countries  and  multilateral  institutions.  Most  of  these \neconomies  increased  the  openness  of  their  financial  systems  during  the  last  two  decades. \nAnd  now,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  many  of  their  financial  systems  are  more \nintegrated  into  the  global  financial  system  than  most  advanced  economies  in  terms  of  the \nrelative  amount  of  foreign  capital  transactions  to  their  economic  size.  This  has  made  their \neconomies  vulnerable  to  contamination  and  spillovers  of  crises  originating  elsewhere.  This \nagain points to the importance of designing a new international financial architecture. \n\n3.3  Government Guarantees \n\nWhen it is found that the central bank\u2019s liquidity support is insufficient to stabilize the market, \nthe government has no choice but to issue a blanket guarantee on bank liability or suspend \nthe troubled banks. Although this measure is controversial due to its long-term moral hazard \neffect  (Demirguc-Kunt  and  Serven  2009),  it  is  unavoidable  in  order  to  stop  a  run  from \nspreading to other institutions. \n\nWhile  suspension  of  banks  has  an  advantage  of  saving  fiscal  costs,  it  tends  to  further \nundermine  market  confidence,  reduce  the  money  supply,  increase  uncertainty,  and \nsometimes  deepen  a  systemic  crisis.  Korea  and  Thailand  suspended  specific  banks  in  an \neffort to  stop runs  during  the  1997 crisis. In  Korea, 14 merchant  banks were  suspended  in \nDecember  1997.  In Thailand,  58 finance  companies  were  suspended  in  the second  half of \n1997. The experience of Korea and Thailand suggests that, although suspension seemed to \nbe  an  expedient means for  dealing  with  runs,  it can  exacerbate  uncertainty  and  precipitate \nmore  runs.  Depositors  in  other  deposit-taking  institutions,  including  commercial  banks, \napparently  foresaw  the  potential  suspension  of  their  institutions  and  began  withdrawing \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\ndeposits as a preventive measure. Similarly, debtors apparently foresaw the loss of access \nto  lines  of  credit  and  ceased  repayment  of  debts  so  as  to  conserve  working  capital.  In \naddition,  borrowers  of  some  suspended  finance  companies  who  had  been  servicing  their \nloans ceased debt repayment (Scott 2002). \n\nIn principle, the government should avoid offering extensive bank liability guarantees, since \nthey limit the government\u2019s flexibility in allocating losses and may create incentives for moral \nhazard. In practice, however, given the systemic nature of the crises and the ensuing loss of \nconfidence,  governments  may  have  few  other  options  than  to  offer  a  broadly  based \nguarantee  of  most  bank  liabilities.  Quickly  restoring  depositor  confidence  is  important  for \nminimizing the damage caused by a financial crisis. A time-bound blanket deposit guarantee \nwas  made  in  Asian  countries  including  Korea,  Indonesia,  and  Thailand  during  the  1997 \nAsian crisis. This was also done in the United Kingdom in the wake of run on Northern Rock \nin 2007. \n\nThe relatively positive results of providing guarantees found in Korea and Thailand stand in \ncontrast  to  the  experience  of  Indonesia.  A  key  distinction  seems  to  be  a  relatively  early \nadoption  of  extensive  bank  liability  guarantees  in  Korea  and  Thailand  and  the  limited \ncredibility of the guarantee eventually adopted in Indonesia (Scott 2002). The guarantees in \nKorea and Thailand appear to have been effective in stabilizing domestic currency funding, \nbut turned out to be ineffective with respect to foreign currency funding. \n\nIn the case of a foreign currency run, a government guarantee is credible only to the extent \nthat  the  government  holds  a  sufficient  amount  of  foreign  reserves  or  swap  arrangements \nwith foreign central banks to be able to honor such a guarantee. In addition, the government \nshould  make  all  information  transparent  on  all  types  of  short-term  and  long-term  debt  and \nforeign reserves to make such a guarantee credible. During the 1997 crisis, foreign creditors \ndid  not  trust the  information  and  statistics  that the  Korean government  disclosed  regarding \nthe  amount  of  usable  foreign  reserves  and  short-term  foreign  debts.  This  intensified  the \ncrisis  in  the  currency  market  and  eventually  led  to  the  IMF  bailout.  In the  recent  crisis, the \nKorean  government,  facing  a  rapidly  falling  foreign  debt  revolving  rate  and  mounting \npressure  on  the  Korean  won,  provided  guarantees  on  domestic  banks\u2019  foreign  debt  up  to \nUS$100  billion,  which  revolves  every  three  months.  Even  though  Korea  held  foreign \nreserves  of  more  than  US$200  billion,  this  guarantee  did  not  successfully  address  the \nconcerns  of  foreign  creditors  regarding  the  possibility  of  currency  crisis  and  eventual \ndefaults. The past record of credibility of the Korean government\u2019s statistics on the amount \nof  total  foreign  debt  and  usable  foreign  reserves  undermined  the  government\u2019s  effort  in \ngaining  the  credibility  required  for  such  a  government  guarantee.  This  highlights  the \nimportance of establishing the credibility of the government\u2019s statistics and, in that respect, \nthe importance for the regulatory authorities of closely monitoring and keeping accurate debt \nstatistics. \n\nEven  if  the  guarantees  provided  are  deemed  credible  and  the  crisis  is  contained,  the \ngovernments still face another set of important challenges. These include the need to control \nthe  additional  deposits  or  debts  that  insolvent  institutions  will  continue  to  attract,  to  make \nsure  the  guaranteed  institutions  invest  these  new  resources  prudently,  and  to  reduce  or \neliminate the guarantees once the containment stage of the crisis is over. \n\nAn extensive literature supports the position that in normal times overly generous safety-net \npolicies and deposit insurance lead to moral hazard and financial instability (Demirguc-Kunt \nand  Kane  2002;  Demirguc-Kunt,  Kane,  and  Laeven  2008).  The  longer  the  guarantee \nremains in place, and the longer insolvent banks are allowed to operate, the more difficult it \nwill be to curb these excessive risk-taking incentives. Thus, it is important to quickly initiate \nthe resolution of insolvent banks and to have a timely exit from such guarantees. In Korea, \nthe  blanket  deposit  insurance  was  provided  for  three  years  and  withdrawn  at  the  end  of \n2000, when the bank restructuring and rehabilitation program was almost completed. When \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nproviding  a  guarantee  on  foreign  debt  early  in  2009,  the  Korean  government  required  the \nbanks that received the guarantee to freeze the compensation of managers and their staff. \n\n3.4  Effective Communications and Building Confidence \n\nEffective  communication  with  the  market  players  is  also  critical  in  the  stage  of  crisis \ncontainment.  It  is  important  that  the  government  communicate  with  the  market  in  a  single \nvoice  with  consistent  messages.  Different messages  conveyed  from  different ministries,  as \nnoted above, can hamper the government\u2019s efforts to contain the crisis. As was suggested, \norganizing  a  crisis management  team  can  be  a good  way  to  address  these  problems. The \ngovernment has to make all available information transparent and assure the market that the \ninformation  and  statistics  it  discloses  are  fully  reliable.  Sometimes  it  may  be  necessary  to \nreplace ministers who appear to be incapable of winning strong confidence from the market. \n\nIn order to add credibility to its messages, the government should prepare a comprehensive \nand  consistent  program,  both  in  macroeconomic  and  sectoral  terms,  to  deal  with \nmacroeconomic  problems  as  well  as  financial  and  corporate  sector  problems,  especially \nthose  responsible  for  the  development  of  the  crisis.  Based  on  those  programs,  the \ngovernment should ask the Parliament or Congress for the approval of sufficient public funds \nto  deal  with  impaired  assets  and  recapitalization.  This  is  one  of  the  most  important \ngovernment  roles  in  containing  a  crisis.  Unless  the  government  program  is  reliable  and \nconvincing, none of the measures discussed above (liquidity supports, guarantees) will be of \nmuch help in containing the crisis. Once the program is prepared, it would be helpful for the \nMinister  or  senior  officials  to  engage  in  investor  relations  (IR)  with  domestic  as  well  as \nforeign  creditors  and  investors  in  international  money  centers  to  earn  their  confidence. \nCommunicating  with  the  public  through  the  help  of  the  media  and  politicians  and  securing \ntheir  support  is  also  crucial  to  mobilizing  political  support  for  the  government\u2019s  program. \nAgain, the credibility and consistency of the program itself is a key to earning the confidence \nof domestic as well as foreign lenders and investors. \n\n4.  THE ROLE OF STATE INTERVENTIONS IN CRISIS \n\nRESOLUTION \n\nWhen the initial panic abates and the market gradually regains confidence, the crisis moves \ninto  its  resolution  stage.  Past  crisis  experiences  provide  many  valuable  lessons  on  how  a \ngovernment  can  effectively  deal  with  impaired  assets  and  recapitalization  or  liquidation  of \ninsolvent  banks.  Again,  a  critically  important  decision  revolves  around  which  banks  to  bail \nout and which banks to let go under. While the government should be prepared to act in a \nsystemic crisis, its approach needs to be designed to reduce conditions for moral hazard and \nthe  possibility  of  a  subsequent  crisis.  This  should  be  done  by  imposing  real  costs  on  all \nresponsible  parties  and  getting  the  resources  back  to  their  productive  use  as  soon  as \npossible.  Any  government  involvement  should  be  designed  to  protect  the  interests  of \ntaxpayers,  impose  losses  on  the  responsible  parties,  and  use  the  market  as  much  as \npossible to pick the winners and losers. \n\nIn  distinguishing  the  banks  that  will  receive  capital  injections  from  those  not  eligible,  the \ngovernment may rely on market criteria. In principle, if the banks are able to mobilize capital \nat least partially from the market, they can be eligible for government assistance. If they fail \nto  do  so,  they  should  not  be  considered  eligible  (Honohan  2005).  Such  banks  can  be \nliquidated,  their  assets  and  liabilities  can  be  transferred  to  other  banks,  or  they  can  be \nnationalized by writing off the capital before the injection of public funds. \n\nIn  this  section,  I  will  discuss  the  government  approach  to  crisis  resolution  based  on  the \nKorean experience during the 1997 crisis, which is considered to be one of the reasonably \nsuccessful cases (although with some weaknesses) of financial and corporate restructuring. \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nThis discussion will include: (i) consolidation of the crisis management team; (ii) developing \ncrisis resolution strategies; (iii) diagnosis of bank conditions; (iv) mobilizing public funds; (v) \nresolving  insolvent  and  capital-deficient  banks; (vi)  management  of  nationalized  banks  and \nprivatization; (vii) resolving nonbank financial institutions; (viii) dealing with impaired assets; \nand finally (viv) strengthening the regulatory framework. \n\nThe  Korean  government  took  quick  action  to  intervene  and  stabilize  banks.  A  number  of \nbanks,  including  the  largest  five,  were  nationalized.  Rapid  intervention  and  recapitalization \nhelped  to  quickly  restore  confidence  in  the  financial  system  and  economic  performance. \nKorean  authorities  were  able  to  mobilize  and  allocate  a  substantial  investment  of  public \nfunds  (done  in  two  rounds  due  to  initial  underestimation  of  the  size  of  problem),  about \nUS$130  billion  in  total,  equivalent  to  about  30%  of  GDP.  It  was  used  for  the  purchase  of \nimpaired  assets  (about  US$32  billion),  recapitalization  of  banks  (about  US$66  billion),  and \npayment of depositors of closed banks (about US$31 billion). Roughly two thirds of impaired \nassets of banks were taken over by the government\u2019s asset management company (Korea \nAsset  Management  Company  [KAMCO])  at  discounted  prices,  and  capital  was  injected  by \nthe  Korea  Deposit  Insurance  Company  (KDIC)  through  issuing  bonds  guaranteed  by  the \ngovernment. In  comparison  to  other governments facing financial  sector crises  in  the  past, \nthese investments were considered extraordinary in terms of size and speed. \n\n4.1  Consolidating the Crisis Resolution Team \n\nFormation of a specific-purpose crisis resolution team is necessary when the government is \npreparing  the  resolution  strategy.  The  crisis  management  team  organized  in  the  contagion \nstage  could  be  developed  into  a  crisis  resolution  team  or  an  entirely  new  team  could  be \ncreated if the initial team has lost market confidence. Key objectives would be to consolidate \nresponsibility, promote consistency of work and decisions, provide the necessary specialized \nskills,  and  insulate  the  work  from  other  official  responsibilities  and  related  conflicts  of \ninterests.  This  crisis  management  team  should  have  a  governing  body  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation  of  its  decisions  through  the  various  government  agencies  involved  and  to \nsecure political support. \n\nThe  officials  or  representatives  from  institutions  who  are  responsible  for  creating  and \ncontributing to the development of the crisis should be excluded from the team, if possible. \nThey tend to underestimate the size of the problem to justify their past mistakes. In the case \nof  Korea  during  the  1997  crisis,  having  experienced  failure  on  the  parts  of  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and Economy (MOFE) and the BOK and given their dwindling credibility, the newly \ncreated FSC was charged with the role of crisis resolution as well as financial and corporate \nrestructuring. The head of the FSC had not held a position in the government for the past 15 \nyears  and  the  Commission  recruited  staff  from  outside  the  government.  The  Emergency \nEconomic  Policy  Coordination  Meeting  was  created  and  chaired  by  the  late  President  Kim \nDae-jung  himself  and  attended  by  key  economic  policymakers  including  the  Minister  of \nFinance and Economy, Governor of the BOK, Head of the FSC, Chief Economic Advisor to \nthe President, and other economic ministers. This played the role of the governing body of \nthe crisis management team. In this weekly held meeting, discussions were held regarding \nthe  measures  to  resolve  the  crisis,  and  after  necessary  coordination  was  made  and \ndecisions were reached, those were communicated to the market. \n\nFacing  the  recent  global  financial  crisis,  the  government  organized  a  similar  institutional \narrangement, namely the Emergency Economic Policy Coordination Meeting chaired by the \nPresident, and it has been held every week with the support of a small secretariat team. The \nteam monitors the markets and prepares a daily report to the President. This has helped the \ngovernment to closely and quickly coordinate its responses to market instabilities. \n\nOne  weakness  of  Korea\u2019s  strategy  of organizing  the  crisis  resolution team  during the  1997 \ncrisis, however, was having placed it under the FSC. Although the FSC had the advantage \nof  separation  from  historical  ties  to  the  creating  of  the  crisis,  the  coordination  between  the \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nFSC and MOFE (which was responsible for mobilizing public funds and monitoring their use) \nwas  not  smooth.  This  weakness  entailed  high  costs  as  the  government  was  unable  to  act \ndecisively and to speak with a single voice. Another weakness was that the dual roles of the \nFSC in crisis resolution and financial sector supervision often gave rise to serious conflicts of \ninterests  during  the  crisis  period.  For  instance,  the  FSC  was  forced  to  accept  implicit \nforbearance when the capital injection made turned out to be insufficient. \n\nIdeally,  central  banks  and  supervisory  agencies  should  play  circumscribed  roles  in  crisis \nresolution.  Due  to  their official  responsibilities for financial  sector  supervision  and for  being \nthe  lender  of  the  last  resort,  these  agencies  are  usually  the  first  to  become  involved  in \ndealing with the effects of a crisis. Nevertheless, when the crisis becomes systemic, they are \noften not prepared to play the leading role in crisis resolution. Moreover, forcing them to do \nso  may  undermine  their  capacity  to  perform  their  permanent  functions.  Although  central \nbanks  have  roles  to  play,  the  government  should  not  compel  them  to  bear  an  excessive \nburden  in  financial  crisis  resolution.  This  may  risk  the  loss  of  monetary  control.  A  more \nappropriate  role  for  a  supervisory  agency  is  an  independent  check  on  the  recapitalization \ntransactions being organized by the government team (Scott 2002). \n\n4.2  Developing Crisis Resolution Strategies \n\nThe  first  key  task  of  a  crisis  resolution  team  is  to  develop  a  comprehensive  and  clear \nresolution strategy and then execute the strategy for solving the problems generated by the \ncrisis. The  problems  are  intertwined.  For  example,  solutions  to financial problems  in banks \nhave  implications  for  debt  restructuring  in  corporate  firms  and  vice  versa.  Steps  taken  in \nnationalizing  banks  have  implications  for  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  privatize  them  (Scott \n2002). Moreover, solutions to financial problems have to be tempered by recognition of their \npolitical  and  social  implications  (e.g.,  unemployment,  foreign  entry,  and  social  instability). \nFailure  to  develop  an  explicit,  comprehensive  strategy  is  likely  to  result  in  actions  and \ndecisions  that  undermine  future  degrees  of  freedom,  leading  to  partial  and  false  solutions \nand subsequently higher long-run costs. \n\nThe  first  step  in  defining  the  strategy  is  to  obtain  from  senior  political  authorities  clearly \ndefined objectives for the crisis resolution team. Based on these objectives, the government \nor  the  team  has  to  define  in  specific  terms  what  is  to  be  accomplished  and  avoided  in  the \nprocess  of  resolving the  crisis. This  serves  as  a  mandate for  the team  driving  the financial \nrestructuring. 4\n At  this  stage,  the  government  needs  to  have  a  clear  vision  on  the  future \nstructure of the financial sector, which serves as objectives for decisions regarding the crisis \nresolution.  These  objectives  then  need  to  be  translated  into  sector-specific  goals  for  the \nbanking  system,  the  NBFI  sector, the  public  sector,  and the  structure  of corporate finance. \nThese  goals  and  an  accompanying  strategy  to  achieve  them  should  be  agreed  upon  and \nendorsed by the governing body (including the head of the government) and shared by other \ngovernment  ministries  and  the  central  bank.  The  strategy  for  achieving  each  goal  should \ndefine  the  key  actions  required  to  move  from  the  present  situation  to  the  privatization  of \nbanks  and  assets  that  the  government  will  acquire  in  the  course  of  solving  the  problems \n(Scott 2002). \n\nThe strategy should be based on a realistic assessment of the dimensions of the problems. \nUnderestimating the scope of the problems would undermine the utility of a comprehensive \nstrategy. A lesson gained from past crises is that problems often are far worse than initially \nanticipated  (Scott  2002).  Therefore,  the  strategy  needs  to  be  flexible,  requiring  continuous \nrevision  and  enhancement  as  it  proceeds.  The  senior  political  authorities  and  the  crisis \nresolution  team  have  distinct  roles  to  play  in  developing  and  executing  a  comprehensive \nstrategy.  The  senior  political  authorities  need  to  orchestrate  political  consensus  regarding \noverall objectives, financial sector vision, medium-term goals, and operating principles. The \n\n                                                \n4 In the Korean case, the FSC assumed this role. \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\ncrisis resolution team needs to handle the details of the strategy based on explicit, politically \nagreed upon guidance on these matters (Scott 2002). It then develops strategy, establishes \npriorities, and defines and executes the specific work required for the crisis resolution. A key \ntask of the team is to maintain political consensus on the main elements of the strategy. This \nis important because the team is likely to encounter serious unforeseen problems, including \nlobbying by vested interests. Similarly, maintaining media and public support for the strategy \nneeds to be included as part of the work program. \n\n4.3  Diagnosis of Bank Conditions \n\nIt is important to distinguish viable banks from non-viable ones early in the crisis to prevent \nwasting  of  funds.  The  government  needs  accurate  information  to  determine  appropriate \nresolution  mechanisms  for  distressed  banks  and  to  estimate  the  potential  requirements  for \nfunding  the  crisis  resolution.  However,  it  is  likely  that  the  authorities  do  not  get  accurate \ninformation regarding the financial condition of banks. Their main sources of information are \naccounting  data  prepared  by  banks  and  debtors  and  the  regulatory  indicators  and \nsupervisory analysis prepared by supervisory authorities. This information can be inaccurate \neven  in  normal  circumstances,  but  tends  to  deviate  further  especially  in  times  of  financial \ndistress. \n\nContributing  to  the  inaccuracy  of  accounting  and  regulatory  information  are  the  incentives \npresented to most stakeholders to underestimate the scope of financial problems, especially \nin the face of a systemic crisis. Bankers who face the risk of losing their jobs if their banks \nare  assessed  to  be  insolvent  are  strongly  inclined  to  underestimate  the  severity  of  their \nfinancial problems. Owners and managers of firms who risk losing control of their business \nor  its  assets  if  the  firms  are  diagnosed  as  insolvent  are  likely  to  be  motivated  by  a  similar \nincentive as the above. Supervisory authorities, who may expect to be held accountable for \nthe  current  situation  by  politicians,  the  media,  and  the  public,  have  incentives  to  downplay \nthe scope of the problems (Scott 2002). \n\nthe  regulatory  measure  of  nonperforming \n\nRegulatory  indicators  also  suffer  a  number  of  weaknesses.  The  regulatory  indicators  that \nreceive  the  most  attention  in  a  crisis  are  nonperforming  loans  and  bank  capital.  Because \nbankers are capable of manipulating accounting information to obscure the actual conditions \nof  debtors, \nloans  can  be  substantially \nunderestimated (Scott 2002). Overstatement of asset values and understatement of liabilities \nmean bank capital can be substantially overstated. This accounting problem is compounded \nby  the  heightened  uncertainty  regarding  financial  and  real  asset  prices  during  the  initial \nphases  of  a  crisis.  Interest  rate  hikes,  huge  exchange  rate  depreciation,  and  near  frozen \nmarkets  for  assets  such  as  land,  buildings,  and  equipment  make  it  difficult  to  estimate \nrealistic values and prices. The likely result of these factors is misdiagnosis of the nature and \nextent  of  the  financial  problems  of  banks  and  debtors.  Therefore,  early  diagnosis  tends  to \nunderestimate, to a large extent, the scope of the problems and the amount of financing that \nwill be required of the government. \n\nFacing these problems, Korea\u2019s crisis resolution team attempted, with the assistance of the \nWorld  Bank,  to  obtain  better  information  on  the  conditions  of  banks  in  at  least  four  ways. \nOne step was to hire international accounting firms to perform diagnostic reviews of troubled \nbanks. This work was performed in two phases, first for the largest and most troubled banks \nand subsequently for the remaining banks. A second step was to require the banks to submit \nrehabilitation  plans  containing  detailed  information  regarding their  prospective financial  and \noperating  conditions.  Progressive  improved  plans  were  demanded.  A  third  step  was  to \ncommission  major  international  firms  to  perform  an  industry  analysis.  A  final  step  was  to \ncommission  another  international  firm  to  develop  a  financial  analysis  model  that  could \nincorporate  various  inputs,  including  the  results  of  the  diagnostic  reviews  and  the  industry \nanalysis,  and  project  the future  profitability  and  equity  recapitalization  needs  of  banks  (Lee \n2006; Scott 2002). To acquire better information on the financial problems of major debtors \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nto  banks,  the  government  also  required  the  larger  companies  in  the  chaebol  to  enter  into \ndebt reduction agreements with their banks. These agreements aimed to generate complete \ninformation regarding the liabilities and cash flows of the chaebol. \n\nHowever,  these  attempts  were  only  partially  successful  in  diagnosing  the  size  of  the \nproblems individual banks were facing. These steps could serve to help identify clearly non-\nviable  banks,  which  should  be  resolved  as  a  priority,  but  they  did  not  provide  sufficient \ninformation  regarding  the  capital  shortfalls  or  the  nature  and  consequences  of  operational \nweaknesses  in  the  banks.  However,  given  the  urgency  of  the  bank  restructuring,  and  the \ndifficulty  in  estimating  the  losses  inherent  in  corporate  debt  restructuring,  the  government \nchose  to  act  quickly  by  determining  the  restructuring  plan  based  on  the  evaluation  of \nindividual  banks\u2019  rehabilitation  plans.  This  later  turned  out  to  be  insufficient  injection  of \ncapital to the banks. \n\nThis  experience  suggests  that,  while  acknowledging  the  need  to  act  quickly  in  the  early \nstage  of  a  crisis,  it  is  essential  to  invest  in  information  gathering  and  analytical  capacity  in \nadvance. It is also important to ensure that the persons responsible for gathering, verifying, \nand  analyzing  this  information  do  not  have  incentives  to  underestimate  the  extent  of  the \nproblems.  This,  in  turn,  has  implications  for  appropriately  organizing  and  staffing  the  crisis \nresolution team. \n\n4.4  Mobilizing Public Funds \n\nSecuring  sufficient  public  funds  to  finance  crisis  resolution  costs  depends  on  the  political \nleadership as well as on political consensus. The Korean government was able to mobilize a \nsignificant  financing  package  early  on  (about  15%  of  GDP),  signaling  the  government\u2019s \ndetermination to tackle the crisis. Gaining quick political consensus on a financing package \nhelped to restore confidence by bolstering the credibility of the government\u2019s statements and \ncommitments. \n\nHowever, the Korean government faced difficulty in determining the appropriate size of the \nfinancing  package.  Initially,  there  was  great  uncertainty  about  the  scope  of  insolvency  and \nthe  amount  of  financing  required.  The  government  faced  a  trade-off  between  speed  in \narranging financing and certainty as to the amount of financing required. The government at \nthe  time  expected  difficulty  in  raising  additional  financing  if  the  initial  package  proved \ninsufficient. Thus, the initial package had to be sufficiently large to be credible to the market. \nTo the extent that assets acquired by the government in the course of crisis resolution can \nbe sold quickly, the proceeds can be used to reduce the size of the financing package. \n\nIn Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia, the governments used indirect methods of financing such \nas  issuing  guarantees  or  writing  put  options  as  a  substitute  for  issuing  direct  government \ndebt.  These  can  be  valid  financing  techniques.  But  the  possible  danger  is  that  these \nobligations  give  rise  to  contingent  liabilities  and  may  obscure  the  cost  of  crisis  resolutions \n(Scott  2002;  Calomiris,  Klingebiel,  and  Laeven  2005).  These  financial  liabilities  have  to  be \nidentified, monitored, and managed in much the same manner as direct liabilities. In Korea, \nwhen the government-guaranteed bonds matured, they were either paid by recovered funds \nor replaced by issuing government bonds. \n\n4.5  Resolving Insolvent and Capital-Deficient Banks \n\nIn  the  early  stage  of  the  crisis,  the  Korean  authorities  had  suspended  the  operations  of  a \nnumber of merchant banks, leaving their customers in limbo and creating uncertainty in the \nmarket.  After  going  through  such  an  experience,  Korea  turned  toward  resolving  insolvent \nbanks  in  an  effort  to  minimize  customer  disruption  and  uncertainty,  especially  among \ndepositors. \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nThree options for resolving insolvent banks were adopted: liquidation, business transfers \n(both asset and liability transfer), and nationalization. The Korean authorities tried to avoid \nliquidating  failed  banks  unless  they  had  little  or  no  franchise  value.  The  authorities  used \nliquidations  to  resolve  small  failed  NBFIs.  For  small  failed  commercial  banks,  they \norchestrated  deposit  and  asset  transfers  to  healthier  banks;  they  nationalized  the  largest \nbanks. Business transfer covered all assets and liabilities to ensure that there would be no \ndisruption  of  business  for  bank  customers.  Shareholders  lost  their  investments  while \ncreditors remained protected. The acquiring banks had access to the central bank\u2019s liquidity \nsupport  to  minimize  the  disruption  of  banking  services  for  customers  of  the  failed  banks. \nThey  also  received  a  put-back  option  on  nonperforming  loans  and  capital  injections  to \nmaintain  their  capital  ratio  at  pre-acquisition  levels.  For  the  nationalized  banks,  top \nmanagers were removed and new managers were instructed to cut costs substantially. \n\nIn Korea, the largest banks had no controlling shareholders, which minimized the prospects \nfor  raising  capital  from  existing  shareholders.  Also,  acquisition  by  a  sound  domestic  bank \nwas  difficult  to  envision  in  such  circumstances.  The  best  policy  alternative  in  these \ncircumstances was for the government to do whatever was necessary to sell strategic stakes \nto qualified  investors  who  would  invest  some  capital  and  assume  control  of  the  banks.  But \nthere were no apparent sources of domestic capital during the crisis (except for some large \nchaebol,  which  were  restricted  from  owning  banks,  as  will  be  discussed  below)  and  the \ngovernment did not want to sell a large portion of the banking system to foreign investors. To \nthe extent that private sector solutions could not be achieved, nationalization was required to \nsustain the core institutions of the banking system. \n\nThe  government  sought  to  use  its  provision  of  public  funds  to  banks  as  an  opportunity  to \npromote consolidation within the banking system. In addition to providing support to healthier \nbanks acquiring weaker banks, the government required mergers among larger banks as a \ncondition for public support. The government adopted this policy as a means to increase the \nefficiency  and  competitiveness  of  Korean  banks  as  well  as  a  means  to  generate  public \nsupport for using public funds to recapitalize the banks. But it is not clear whether this indeed \ncontributed to a significant increase in the efficiency or competitiveness of Korean banks. \n\nTo  minimize  the  risk  of  moral  hazard,  the  World  Bank  recommended  that  the  government \nallocate  support  to  a  bank  only  once  (Scott  2002).  Full  recapitalization  of  banks  seemed \nnecessary  to  provide  the  management  capital  cushion  that  would  assist  banks  with \nnecessary restructuring and reactivating their normal operations, especially lending. Failure \nto  provide  sufficient  recapitalization  would  undermine  or  delay  restructuring,  prolong  the \ncredit crunch leading to inappropriate risk-taking by management, and weaken the credibility \nof the authorities. This would require more rounds of support and costs would increase as a \nresult. A shortage of public funds for recapitalization was a key constraint to the overall bank \nresolution  program  in  the  case  of  Korea.  This  was  caused  by  initial  underestimation  of  the \nsize of the problem, as explained above. This underestimation was partly ameliorated by the \nsecond round of approval of public funds by the National Assembly. \n\nOne  of  the  difficulties  in  quickly  resolving  the  failed  banks  stemmed  from  uncertainty  of \ncorporate  restructuring.  The  Korean  banks\u2019  non-performing  assets  were  caused  not  by  the \nburst  of  the  housing  bubble  but  by  highly  indebted  corporate  insolvencies.  Thus,  in  Korea, \nthe  financial  restructuring  had  to  be  carried  out  simultaneously  with  corporate  debt \nrestructuring. This further complicated the financial restructuring process (Cho 2002b). It was \nalmost  impossible  to  make  a  clear  estimation  of the  amount  of  loss,  since  uncertainty  was \nstill looming over the future value of corporate firms. The government opted for a gradualist \napproach  to  corporate  debt  restructuring,  and  this  significantly  undermined  the  bank \nresolution strategy. When big companies in the chaebol (including Daewoo) failed later, the \ngovernment had to recapitalize the banks again. \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\n4.6  Management of Nationalized Banks and Privatization \n\nNationalization of banks brought with it major responsibility for the government not only for \nrecapitalizing the banks but also for exerting governance and overseeing bank restructuring. \nFor  that  reason,  nationalization  represents  a  substantial  challenge  to  the  capacity  of  the \ngovernment. The government has to ensure that the support provided was put to good use \nin order to minimize potential demands for additional support, and to maximize the potential \nfor prompt reprivatization. \n\nThe  principal  tool  to  accomplish  this  objective  was  performance  contracts  for  the  senior \nmanagers  of  nationalized  banks  in  Korea.  As  a  condition  for  granting  public  support,  the \nKorean  government  imposed  performance  contracts  containing  strict  terms  on  the  top \nmanagement  to  promote  restructuring.  But  this  also  suffered  from  a  lack  of  sufficient \ninformation  on  the  quality  of  assets.  Managers  were  most  successful  in  their  efforts  to \nreduce  staff  expenses  and  close  or  sell  branches.  On  average,  Korean  domestic  banks \nreduced  staff  costs  by  around  35%  and  reduced  the  number  of  branches  by  20%.  But  in \nother areas, they did not take much initiative beyond rapidly expanding loans to households \nand  consumers.  In  the  case  of  two  nationalized  banks,  management  contracts  were  made \nso  that  they  could  be  managed  by  private  banks  until  they  could  be  privatized  (one  big \nnationwide bank was managed by a foreign bank and one small regional bank was managed \nby a sound domestic bank). \n\nKorean  banking  law  prohibits  industrial  chaebol  firms  from  owning  banks.  Their  maximum \nshare  was  limited  to  4%.  Therefore,  banks\u2019  shares  were  defused  and  there  was  no \ncontrolling  shareholder.  In  this  circumstance,  only  healthier  domestic  banks  or  foreign \nfinancial  institutions  could  take  over  nationalized  banks.  Reprivatization  of  nationalized \nbanks  thus  generated  a  great  challenge  for  the  government. When  initiating  banking  crisis \nresolution,  the  Korean  government  wanted  to  attract  private  sector  capital  to  complement \npublic  funds  invested  in  banks.  The  Korean  government  liberalized  regulations  regarding \nforeign  ownership  to  permit  100%  ownership  of  banks  by  foreign  financial  institutions. \nNevertheless,  the  government  was  unable  to  attract  foreign  capital  during  the  crisis \nresolution  due  to  the  government\u2019s  failure  to  acknowledge  the  reduced  value  of  the  banks \nand  to  articulate  clearly  to  potential  investors  the  terms  and  conditions  under  which  public \nsupport would be available. \n\nThe IMF and World Bank teams advised quick privatization of nationalized banks. They also \nrecommended  privatization  to  foreign  strategic  investors  as  it  would  bring  about  significant \nstructural  changes  and  import  of  needed  management  skills  and  technology.  They \nadvocated  an  open  auction  process  designed  to  lead  to  the  sale  of  majority  stakes  in  the \nbanks to strategic investors (Scott 2002). The floating of shares on the stock exchange was \nto  be  avoided  as  it  would  likely  permit  insufficient  recapitalization  by  the  public  sector  and \nresult  in  weak  governance  and  management.  Following  this  advice,  the  Korean  authorities \nquickly initiated an auction process and tapped professional support (an investment bank, an \naccounting  firm,  and  a  privatization  advisor),  but  the  process  broke  down  and  resulted  in \ndirect negotiations with a number of potential foreign investors. One bank was privatized to \nNew Bridge Capital, a US-based private equity fund, and another was sold to Hana Bank, a \nhealthier domestic bank with substantial foreign shareholdings. \n\nOverall, privatization turned out to be no easy task. The Korean government so far has not \nbeen able to privatize one of the largest banks, Woori Bank, which was nationalized during \nthe  crisis.  The  self-imposed  deadline  for  privatization  was  not  met  and  has  been  pushed \nback several times. There has been political resistance to sell it to foreign strategic investors, \ngiven that three out of the largest seven commercial banks have already been taken over by \nforeign  investors.  Chaebol  firms  are  still  not  allowed  by  law  to  own  banks.  In  the  case  of \nmost  of  the  largest  commercial  banks  in  Korea,  Woori  Bank  being  the  only  exception,  the \ntotal  foreign  investors\u2019  share,  including  portfolio  investors,  now  exceeds  50%.  The \ngovernment  recently  revised  the  banking  laws  to  allow  increased  participation  of  industrial \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nchaebol  firms  and  private  equity  funds  in  the  bank  ownership  as  a  way  to  seek  bank \nprivatization.5\n\n \n\n4.7  Resolving Non-Bank Financial Institutions \n\nWhile  commercial  banks  were  not  allowed  to  be  owned  by  industrial  chaebol  in  Korea, \nNBFIs,  including  security  firms  and  insurance  companies,  were  allowed.  As  a  result,  most \nNBFIs in Korea have been owned by chaebol or other private controlling shareholders. The \nKorean  authorities  limited  the  use  of  public  funds  in  resolving  NBFIs  to  those  required  to \nmeet  the  government  guarantee  on  NBFI  liabilities.  Existing  shareholders  were  given  a \ncertain time period to recapitalize and restructure. If those efforts failed, the government then \nintervened.  NBFIs  were  resolved  either  by  business  transfers  to  other  institutions  (at  least \ntheir government guaranteed liabilities) or liquidation. Few NBFIs were nationalized. \n\nAs a result of this far reaching financial restructuring, a number of banks and NBFIs exited \nthe market. Many of them merged with or were taken over by others. The number of banks \nand  NBFIs  has  been  significantly  reduced  and  the  soundness  of  Korean  banks  has  been \nmuch improved (Table 1). The stability of the financial system was fully restored after two or \nthree  years.  This  was  achieved  in  conjunction  with  a  substantial  improvement  of  the  debt \nratio as well as other financial indicators of the corporate sector (Figure 4). \n\nTable 1: Results of Financial Restructuring \n\nItem \nNumber of financial institutions \nNumber of banks \nBanks\u2019 non-performing loan ratio \nBanks\u2019 capital ratio \n\nSource: Financial Supervisory Commission. \n\n1997 \n2,101 \n33 \n13.6% \n7.0% \n\n2005 \n1,346 \n19 \n1.2% \n12.8% \n\nFigure 4: Corporate Sector Financial Indicators \n\nInternational Comparison of \nCorporate Financial Structure\n\nCurrent ratio Equity to total \n\nassets\n\nDebt to equity \nratio\n\n \n\n \n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nUnited States\n\nGermany\n\nJapan\n\n \n\n \n\n%\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n20 \n\nSource: Financial Supervisory Commission. \n\n4.8  Dealing with Impaired Assets6\n\n \n\nTo deal with impaired assets, the Korean government established the Non-Performing Asset \nManagement  Fund  (the  \u201cNPA  Fund\u201d)  under  the  management  of  KAMCO  and  raised  funds \n\n                                                \n5 The cap of ownership by an industrial chaebol was increased to 9% from 4% in July 2009. \n6 This subsection is based on Ministry of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea (2009). \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nthrough  government  guarantees.  The  government  classified  the  impaired  assets  based  on \ncollateral availability, seniority, and degree of impairment and applied a consistent haircut to \nassets within the same class. One example of valuation methods is described in Table 2. \n\nTable 2: Pricing Scheme for Impaired Assets \n\nDegree of Impairment  Collateral Availability  Valuation \nSecured \nOrdinary assets \n \nUnsecured \nSecured \nUnsecured \n\nSpecial assets* \n \n\nEffective collateral value \u00d7 45.0% \nBook value of assets \u00d7 3.0% \nEffective collateral value \u00d7 28.2% \nBook value of assets \u00d7 3.0% \n\n*Assets related to obligators under restructuring or resolution process. \n\nSource: Ministry of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea (2009). \n\nThe  haircut  used for the  valuation  of secured  assets  was  based  on the historic  average  of \nrecovery  rate  less  the  portion  given  to  senior  lien  holders.  For  unsecured  assets,  it  was \nbased  on  the  historic  non-performing  loan  recovery  rates  of  KAMCO.  Collateral  value  was \nappraised  by  professional  third-party  property  appraisers  to  ensure  the  credibility  of  the \npricing mechanism. Another notable aspect of Korea\u2019s case is that the Korean government \nused a post-settlement scheme to share the proceeds from the sale of impaired assets with \nfinancial  institutions  in  order  to  build  a  relationship  of  trust  and  induce  the  participation  of \nsuch institutions. \n\nPricing impaired assets and removing them from the balance sheet is an important exercise \nin  determining  the  financing  requirements  for  recapitalization  of  banks.  In  this  regard,  the \ntask  of  preventing  a  potential  conflict  of  interests  was  considered  crucial,  and  the \ngovernment  sought  not  to  delegate  both  functions  to  a  single  agency.  The  Korean \ngovernment  assigned  KAMCO  the  role  of  relieving  impaired  assets  and  KDIC  the  role  of \nrecapitalizing  financial  institutions.  The  rationale  behind  this  decision  was  that  a  single \nagency endowed with both responsibilities would not be able to negotiate the lowest price for \nthe impaired assets, largely because doing so would require a capital injection in the future. \n\nAssigning  each  function  to  different  institutions  ensured  that  one  of  them  would  appraise \nasset  values  based  solely  on  their  intrinsic  value  and  the  other  would  decide  whether  to \ninject  money  by  independently  judging  the  viability  and  systemic  importance  of  the \ninstitutions concerned. Further, recognizing the need to coordinate both functions to achieve \nfinancial stability, the Korean government established the Public Fund Oversight Committee \nto control and supervise the operation of KAMCO and KDIC. \n\nThe  Korean  government  also  adopted  various  exit  measures  to  minimize  government \nintervention  and  revive  the  market  functions,  as  well  as  lessen  the  fiscal  burden.  Methods \nwere  adopted to quickly  dispose  of  acquired  impaired  assets. These  included  conventional \nmethods  such  as  court  auctions,  public  auctions,  and  direct  sales,  as  well  as  less \nconventional  international  tenders,  securitization,  joint  ventures,  and  debt-equity  swaps. \nThrough  these  efforts,  US$33.9  billion  (US$62  billion  in  book  value)  has  been  recovered, \nwhich exceeds the amount spent (Table 3). \n\nTable 3: KAMCO\u2019s Recovery of Public Funds \n\nAssets \nAcquired \n\nRecovery \n\nBalance Held \n\nBook \nvalue \n\nPurchase \nprice \n\nBook \nvalue \n\nPurchase \nprice \n\nRecovery \n\nBook \nvalue \n\nPurchase \nprice \n\n85.1 \n\n30.9 \nKAMKO = Korea Asset Management Company. \n\n62.0 \n\n24.8 \n\n33.9 \n\n23.1 \n\n6.1 \n\nSource: Ministry of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea (2009). \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\n4.9  Strengthening the Regulatory Framework \n\nin \n\nCrisis  resolution  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  build  a  new  system\u2014a  more  robust  and \nsound financial system. Political support for regulatory reform could never be stronger than \nin times of crisis. In Korea, in conjunction with financial restructuring, global standards were \nintroduced \nloan  classification,  provisioning  rules,  and  auditing  and  accounting. \nInternational  best  practices  of  corporate  governance  structure  (Anglo-American-type \ncorporate  governance  structure)  were  also  adopted  in  financial  institutions.  Now  the  banks \nare required to have outside directors take the majority of seats in the board of directors and \nsubcommittee  chairs  are  all  outside  directors.  The  strengthening  of  regulatory  rules  has \ncontributed  to  making  the  management  and  operation  of  financial  institutions  more \ntransparent.  It  has  also  contributed  to  substantial  improvements  in  the  soundness  of  the \nfinancial sector. \n\nBut  in  the  course  of  strengthening  the  regulatory  system,  Korea  also  experienced  several \nproblems that it could have handled better (Cho 2002a). First, the unbalanced approach to \nstrengthening  the  regulatory  rules  on  banks  and  NBFIs  led  to  a  shift  of  funds  from  better \nregulated banks to less-well-regulated or poorly regulated NBFIs, especially investment and \ntrust  companies  (ITCs).  While  Korea\u2019s  crisis  resolution  efforts  concentrated  on  banks  and \nmerchant  banks,  the  regulatory  rules  and  standards  were  also  strengthened  in  these \ninstitutions. Strengthened loan classification and provisioning rules led to conservative loan \ndecisions  and  risk  management  in  the  banking  system.  To  meet  the  capital  adequacy \nrequirement,  banks\u2019  assets  did  not  grow  and  loans  to  corporate  firms  were  reduced. \nCorporate  firms  with  cash  shortages  sought  other  sources  of finance  and  relied  heavily  on \nissuing  bonds,  which  were  purchased  by  ITCs  that  were  still  poorly  supervised.  Prevalent \nirregularities of their business operations allowed heavy financing to risk-taking chaebol firms \nsuch as Daewoo, and when these firms got into trouble, they also could not avoid a similar \nfate. This required a second round of mobilization of public funds and financial restructuring. \n\nSecond,  the  strengthening  of  bank  regulatory  rules  itself  had  a  contractionary  monetary \neffect. When  the  banks  had  to  maintain  the  required  capital  adequacy  ratio  under  the  new \nloan classification and provisioning rules, they could not increase their lending. The money \ncreation  function  of  commercial  banks  was  substantially  undermined  during  the  transition \nperiod  when  regulatory  rules  were  strengthened,  and  when  bank  restructuring  was \nundergoing progress. The money multiplier sharply fell during this period (Cho 2002a). Even \nwith  a  rapid  increase  of  reserve  money,  broad  money  (M2)  growth  was  very  slow.  This \nfurther  deepened  the  economic  recession  in  1998.  In  fact,  the  institution  that  led  the  M2 \nsupply during this period was not the central bank (BOK) but the regulatory body (FSC). This \nsuggests that monetary policy and supervisory policy need to be well coordinated not only in \nboom times but also in crisis times to reduce procyclicality. \n\n5.  LESSONS AND CONCLUSION \n\nAlthough financial crises share a number of common features, they are not identical. Every \ncrisis  takes  place  in  different  circumstances  and  thus  requires  different  approaches.  To \ncontain and resolve a crisis, it is critical to understand the nature of the crisis. In the Korean \ncase, the recent crisis is different from the one faced in 1997 in terms of the nature, scope, \nand  origin.  Accordingly,  the  government  response  to  the  crisis  has  been  different  in  a \nnumber  of  respects.  During  this  crisis,  the  government  has  used  extremely  expansionary \nfiscal and monetary policies to minimize the impact of external shocks caused by the global \nfinancial  crisis.  However,  the  crisis  in  1997  required  a  fundamental  corporate  and  financial \nrestructuring. The crisis of 1997 was, to a large extent, a homegrown one and problems of \nthe  financial  as  well  as  the  corporate  sector  were  the  main  cause  for  the  instability  in  the \nbanking  system  and  the  exchange  market.  The  government  was  not  able  to  use  an \nexpansionary  macroeconomic  policy  response  given  the  currency  market  situation.  On  the \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\ncontrary,  the  government  had  to  use  tight  macroeconomic  policies  to  help  stabilize  the \ncurrency market. This further aggravated the corporate financial situation and deepened the \nbanking crisis. \n\nThis  paper  has  discussed  the  role  of  the  state  in  crisis  containment  and  resolution  based \nmainly  on  the  Korean  experience  of  the  1997 financial  crisis. The  Korean government  was \nnot  fully  successful  in  dealing  with  the  crisis;  it  did  make  mistakes.  But  the  Korean \nexperience  of  overcoming  the  economic  crisis  of  1997  has  drawn  much  attention  from \npolicymakers  as  well  as  economists,  and  is  regarded  as  one  of  the  successful  efforts. \nAlthough there is no one-size-fits-all solution for every crisis, we may be able to draw several \nlessons from the  Korean  experience.  Chief  among  these  lessons  are the importance  of: (i) \nimproving  the  quality  of  information  on  financial  institutions  and  systems,  (ii)  mobilizing \npolitical  support,  (iii)  taking  prompt  action,  (iv)  implementing  a  balanced  approach  to \nstrengthening  regulation,  (v)  ensuring  effective  coordination  between  monetary  and \nsupervisory  authorities,  (vi)  dealing  with  conflicts  of  interests,  and  (vii)  establishing  a  new \ninternational financial architecture. \n\n5.1 \n\nInformation \n\nThe  Korean  experience  of  financial  restructuring  suggests  the  importance  of  having  a  well \ndefined,  comprehensive,  and  integrated  strategy  for  crisis  resolution.  The  effectiveness  of \nthis  strategy  in  quickly  resolving  the  troubled  banks  and  restoring  the  banking  system\u2019s \nstability  depends  on  the  availability  of  relevant  information.  Korea\u2019s  financial  restructuring \nwas  largely  successful. But  the government failed  to  inject  a  sufficient  amount  of capital  in \nthe initial round and had to repeat the process of recapitalization. It also underestimated the \namount  of  public  funds  necessary  to  deal  with  the  problems.  When  the  government \nrecapitalized the banks, it did not have sufficient information to assess banks\u2019 capital needs, \nespecially  information  regarding  losses  in  the  loan  portfolios.  The  lack  of  information  also \nimpaired  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  define  performance  contracts  for  the  managers  of \nnationalized  banks.  The  basic  lesson  is  that  bank  recapitalization  cannot  proceed  in  a \nvacuum.  Losses  in  assets  must  be  made  as  transparent  as  possible  in  the  process  of \nrecapitalization.  Substantial  restructuring  and  improvement  of  bank  operations  also  must \ntake place through tight monitoring. To promote these objectives, the government should be \nable to make informed decisions. Thus, the importance of improving the quality and scope of \ndata  in  the  financial  system,  including  that  in  individual  financial  institutions,  cannot  be \noveremphasized. \n\n5.2  Political Support \n\nFinancial  and  corporate  restructuring  is  bound  to  produce  many  losers.  These  potential \nlosers include banks, non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), and big companies, which tend \nto  have  strong  political  connections  and  influence  over  the  local  media.  They  are  likely  to \nlobby hard against the decisions made by the crisis management team. Crisis resolution is a \nprocess  of  allocating  losses  among  stakeholders  including  creditors,  shareholders,  and \ntaxpayers.  Principles  and  fairness  are  important  in  the  process.  Once  these  are \ncompromised,  the  government  will  be  unable  to  drive  the  financial  and  corporate \nrestructuring  effectively.  This  means  that  strong political  support for  the crisis management \nteam is critical. Crisis times provide a rare opportunity for economic reform and restructuring. \nIn a time of crisis, political support for difficult reforms can be easily mobilized. Nevertheless, \nwhen it comes to deciding who stays and who fails, pulls and pushes of political games and \nblackmail can thrive. Without strong support from the very top of the government, the drivers \nof crisis resolution can easily become victims of political fighting. Thus, as was suggested in \nthe  previous  section,  the  institutional  arrangement  of  the  crisis  resolution  team  and  its \ngoverning  body  should  be  organized  in  a  way  that  allows  effective  mobilization  of  political \nsupport  and  management  of  political  resistance.  It  is  also  important  for  the  crisis \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nmanagement  team  to  have  effective  communication  channels  with  political  circles  and  the \nmedia. \n\n5.3  Prompt Government Action \n\nIn times of crisis, when uncertainty is high and accounting data is not reliable, the authorities \nface  difficult  choices  as  to  whether  they  should  quickly  recapitalize  to  resume  the  normal \nfunction  of  banks  or  wait,  by  giving  forbearance,  until  the  size  of  the  hole  becomes \nreasonably  clear.  The  Korean  government  opted  for  the  first  option\u2014acting  quickly\u2014even \nthough  it  did  not  have  sufficient  information.  This  later  required  another  round  of \nrecapitalization, and perhaps increased the ultimate cost of bank restructuring. However, its \nimpact on the overall economic recovery was positive. There is trade-off between promptly \naddressing the bank insolvency problem and trying to avoid repeated recapitalization and its \nmoral  hazard  effect.  Although  the  former  may  turn  out  to  be  more  costly  in  terms  of  total \npublic funds spent for recapitalization, it can also be viewed as a preferred option because it \nhelps to quickly normalize the operation of the banking system, which then contributes to an \nearly recovery of real sector activities. In other words, prompt action may increase the cost \nof  financial  restructuring  but  may  reduce  the  overall  cost  to  the  economy  in  terms  of  lost \nemployment and output. \n\nCrisis resolution is like fighting in a battlefield. Effective crisis management requires effective \ntriage.  Sometimes  the  government  has  to  compromise  among  conflicting  goals  and  make \ndecisions as it takes into account a number of trade-offs. It would be unrealistic to envision a \nsingle  textbook  perfectly  suitable  for  dealing  with  every  crisis.  Although  we  cannot \ncompletely eliminate the possibility of making costly mistakes, speed in such circumstances \nis  important  to  invite  an  early  recovery  of  the  real  economy.  Nevertheless,  we  cannot \noveremphasize  the  importance  of  following  the  principles  as  closely  as  possible  in  the \ncourse  of  dealing  with  troubled  financial  institutions,  as  was  discussed  in  the  previous \nsections. \n\n5.4  Balanced Approach to Strengthening Regulation \n\nThe  way  the  financial  restructuring  was  carried  out  in  Korea  after  the  crisis  turned  out  to \nexert  quick  impacts  on  the  subsequent  development  of  the  financial  market  structure. \nKorea\u2019s  financial  restructuring  plan  initially  concentrated  on  the  restructuring  of  banks  and \nmerchant  banks.  Strengthening  regulatory  standards  and  rules  also  focused  on  these \ninstitutions.  Other  financial  institutions,  including  investment  and  trust  companies  (ITCs) \nremained  beyond  the  scope  of  strengthening  of supervision  or  restructuring. The  prevalent \nirregularities  in  the  mobilization  and  management  of  investors\u2019  money  by  these  institutions \nwere  benignly  neglected  by  the  supervisory  authorities.  As  a  result,  these  institutions  took \nadvantage of poor regulatory oversight for their rapid expansion (Cho 2002b). \n\nThis  had  both  positive  and  negative  impacts.  The  positive  impact  was  immediate  in  that  it \nmitigated  the  impact  of  the  credit  crunch  in  the  banking  sector  (e.g.,  by  providing  a  \u201cspare \ntire\u201d  as  Alan  Greenspan,  former  Chairman  of  the  US  Federal  Reserve  mentioned).  The \nnegative  impact  was  realized  over  time.  The  imbalanced  approach  to  strengthening \nregulatory  rules  shifted  the  funds  from  the  banking  sector,  in  which  regulation  was \nstrengthened, to a sector that remained poorly regulated. As a result, the overall risk to the \nfinancial system did not improve. The rapid expansion of the investment and trust business \nsustained  the  firms  of  which  bankruptcy  should  have  been  realized  earlier.  When  the \ninvestment  and  trust  companies  imploded,  the  securities  market  collapsed  (the  \u201cspare  tire\u201d \nalso went flat), and this added to the ultimate amount of nonperforming loans as well as the \ntaxpayers\u2019  burden. 7\n This  suggests  that  an  approach  to  financial  restructuring  requires  a \n\n                                                \n7 See Cho (2002b) for more details. \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\ncareful balance among different segments of the financial system during the process of crisis \nresolution. \n\n5.5  Macro-Prudential Regulation: Coordination Between Monetary \n\nand Supervisory Policies \n\nintermediaries  (Cho  2002a).  During \n\nThe Korean experience showed that financial restructuring and strengthening the regulatory \nrules  have  a  strong  contractionary  effect  by  diminishing  the  money  creation function  of  the \ninvolved \ntime  of  bank  restructuring  and \nstrengthening of regulatory rules, the actual monetary stance was affected more strongly by \nthe  actions  taken  by  the  supervisory  authorities\u2014through  reducing  the  money  multiplier\u2014\nthan  those  taken  by  the  monetary  authorities.  This  suggests  that  there  should  be  close \ncoordination between the two authorities, if they are separate, in order to avoid unintended \nconsequences  for  the  money  supply  during  crisis  resolution.  Effective  macro-prudential \nregulation,  through  close  policy  coordination  between  the  regulatory  body  and  the  central \nbank,  is  important  not  only  in  boom  times  to  prevent  bubbles,  but  also  in  times  of  bank \nrestructuring to prevent sharp economic contraction. \n\nthe \n\n5.6  Conflicts of Interests: Problem of Regulatory Authority Being a \n\nMain Driver of Crisis Resolution \n\nIn  the  case  of  Korea,  the  newly  created  Financial  Supervisory  Commission  (FSC),  the \nregulatory body, was empowered to become the main driver of the crisis resolution. A crisis \nresolution team was formed under the FSC. This had some advantages, as was discussed \nabove. But it had some weaknesses as well. The dual role of crisis resolution and financial \nsector regulation gave rise to conflicts of interests during the time of bank restructuring. The \nFSC was forced to give forbearance to the banks when they could not meet the regulatory \nstandards  and  rules  due  to  problems  caused  by  the  actions  of  the  crisis  resolution  team, \nwhich  was  under  the  FSC,  such  as the  initial  underestimation  of  the  size  of  loss, failure to \nmobilize  a  sufficient  amount  of  public  funds,  and  insufficient  recapitalization.  This \nundermined the capacity of the FSC to perform its permanent function, that is, the effective \nsupervision  and  regulation  of  financial  institutions.  Another  problem  was  the  policy \ncoordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  (MOFE).  MOFE  was  mainly \nresponsible  for  financial  sector  policies  and  mobilization  of  public  funds  to  address  the \nfinancial  crisis.  The  coordination  and  cooperation  between  MOFE  and  the  FSC,  which \nbecame  in  charge  of  financial  restructuring,  was  not  always  smooth.  This  proved  costly  as \nthe government was unable to act decisively and to speak with a single voice. \n\n5.7  New International Financial Architecture \n\nUntil  the  current  crisis,  much  criticism  and  concern  had  been  expressed  regarding  the \nbuilding  of  large  foreign  reserves.  However,  if  Korea  had  not  accumulated  such  a  large \namount of reserves, it might well have faced another currency crisis this time. Most emerging \nmarket  economies\u2019  currencies  are  non-convertible.  Due  to  global  financial  integration,  an \nincreasing proportion of the assets and liabilities of these economies\u2019 banks and NBFIs has \nbecome  denominated  in  international  settlement  currency,  especially  in  United  States (US) \ndollars. This leaves the national governments and central banks in a helpless position when \nthey face dollar liquidity problems. During the period of de-leveraging of financial institutions \nin the US and Europe in 2008\u20132009, emerging market financial institutions, including those \nin  Korea,  suffered  from  severe  liquidity  problems.  The  central  banks  of  international \nsettlement (or reserve) currency provided liquidity to their domestic institutions, but they did \nnot\u2014and  could  not\u2014do  the  same  for  foreign  institutions,  even  though  both  made \ntransactions  in  the  same  currency.  This  deepened  the  instability  of  the  exchange  and \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\n \n\nCho \n\nfinancial markets of emerging market economies. The balance sheet effect of exchange rate \nvolatility further deepened the crisis in these economies. \n\nHowever,  if  every  economy  were  to  try  to  hold  a  large  amount  of  foreign  reserves  as \ninsurance against crises, it could generate damaging consequences including mercantalistic \ndomestic  policies,  undervaluation  of  currency,  export  promotion,  and  continuation  of  global \nimbalances.  A  new  international  financial  architecture  is  urgently  in  demand.  As  the \nestablishment  of  a  global  central  bank  will  not  be  realized  soon,  measures  such  as  swap \narrangements  between  central  banks  of  reserve  currency  and  central  banks  of  emerging \nmarket  economies  should  be  more  actively  considered.  Regional  monetary  arrangements \nare another option to consider. Swap arrangements among central banks in the region or the \nestablishment  of  regional  monetary  funds  can  also  be  of  help  in  protecting  participating \ncountries from the risk of currency crises. \n\n26 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 196 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nCho \n\nAmsden, A.

Crises  in  emerging  market  and  developing  economies  tend  to  be  more \ncomplicated  than  those  faced  by  advanced  economies  because  they  are  twin  crises: \nfinancial  and  currency  crises.  Such  crises  require  the  development  of  a  comprehensive \nstrategy covering the stabilization of the domestic financial market and the foreign exchange \nmarket,  closely  coordinated  responses  by  different  government  bodies,  an  extraordinary \neffort  for  financial  restructuring,  and  the  introduction  of  a  new  regulatory  framework.  This \neffort  should  be  based  on  an  effective  crisis  management  team  of  experts  given  a  clear \nmandate with well defined power; strong political support; effective communication with the \nmarket players, both domestic and foreign; and sufficient mobilization of public funds. In this \nregard, this paper emphasizes the importance of building a reliable information base, prompt \nactions,  orchestrating  political  consensus,  and  a  balanced  approach  to  restructuring  and \nregulation among different types of financial institutions. The paper also highlights the need \nfor  a  new  international  financial  architecture  matching  the  rapid  integration  into  the  global \nmarket of the financial markets of emerging and developing economies while their currency \nremains non-convertible. \n", " \nJEL Classification: E58, G01, G18, G21, G28, F34, F36, N20, O16 \n", " \n"]}
