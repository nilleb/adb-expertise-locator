It controls for\nendogenous self-selection and program placement, using data from a unique\nsurvey conducted in 1995-1996. Results indicate that even prior to program\nintervention, participants tend to be significantly wealthier than nonparticipants,\nand the wealthiest villagers are almost twice as likely to participate in the\nprogram as the poorer villagers. Moreover, the wealthiest in the village often\nbecome program committee members and use their positions to borrow\nsubstantially more than rank and file members. However, local information on\nindividual creditworthiness is also used in member selection. Results demonstrate\nthat microfinance loans positively affect many measures of household welfare\nfor the wealthy committee members, but the impact is largely insignificant for\npoorer rank and file members. Policy recommendations include increased\nvigilance in targeting the poor, greater efforts to publicly disseminate the rules\nand purpose of the village bank program, and introduction and enforcement of\neligibility criteria based on wealth while continuing to allow villagers to self-\nselect.\n39", "I. INTRODUCTION\nH\nistorically, efforts to deliver formal credit and financial services to the rural poor in\ndeveloping countries have failed. Commercial banks generally do not serve the needs\nof the rural poor because of the perceived high risk and the high transaction costs\nassociated with small loans and savings deposits. To fill the void, many governments have tried\nto deliver formal credit to rural areas by setting up special agricultural banks or directing\ncommercial banks to loan to rural borrowers. However, these programs have almost all failed\nbecause of the political difficulty for governments to enforce loan repayment, and because the\nrelatively wealthy and powerful, rather than the poor, received most of the loans (Adams et al.\n1984, Adams and Vogel 1986, World Bank 1989).\nThe recent proliferation of innovative microfinance programs, often based on a group-lending\nmethodology, has been largely inspired by the belief that such programs reach the poor and have\na positive impact on various measures of their welfare, including economic measures (e.g., wealth\nand income), social measures (e.g., educational attainment and health status), and less tangible\nmeasures such as \u201cempowerment\u201d. The popular press has waved the banner of microfinance as\nperhaps the most important recent tool to reduce poverty (see for example, San Francisco Examiner\n1990, 1999; The Economist 1993; Malveaux 1997; and New York Times 1997). The 1997 Microcredit\nSummit called for the mobilization of $20 billion over a 10-year period to support microfinance\n(Microcredit Summit Report 1997). Much of this faith in microfinance is based on the highly selective\nanecdotal evidence of individuals who are reported to have pulled themselves and their families\nout of poverty with the benefit of microcredit.1 Yet, despite the proliferation of these programs\nand the outpouring of support by donors, there has been precious little sound empirical research\nthat tests the hypotheses that they are reaching and benefiting the poor.2\n1 There remain dissenters to the popular view of microfinance. For example, Adams and von Pischke (1992, 1468)\nhave written that \u201cdebt is not an effective tool for helping most poor people enhance their economic condition,\nbe they operators of small farms or micro entrepreneurs, or poor women.\u201d They argue that access to credit is\nnot a significant problem faced by small agricultural households and that factor and product prices, land tenure,\ntechnology, and risk are the factors limiting small farmer development.\n2 For discussions on theoretical aspects of group lending, see Stiglitz (1990), Varian (1990), Besley and Coate\n(1995), Van Tassel (1999), Ghatak (1999), Conning (1999), Armendariz de Aghion (1999), Ghatak and Guinnane\n(1999), and Coleman (2000).\n1", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nTo form the basis of such a significant investment to reduce poverty compared to alternative\ninvestments in other poverty alleviation programs, the proposition that microfinance reaches the\npoor and positively affects their welfare should be proven and not just assumed. This paper attempts\nto address this shortcoming in the literature by examining the results of a survey of two Northeast\nThailand \u201cvillage bank\u201d programs that target the poor. The survey was designed and conducted\nin 1995-1996 to measure outreach and impact on the poor, while controlling for the endogeneity\nbiases that have plagued other studies.\nThe nongovernment organization (NGO) programs studied in this paper, as do many\nmicrofinance programs, target \u201cthe poorest of the poor\u201d according to project documents and donor\npolicy. The ability of any program to achieve this goal depends on the institutional context in which\nit is implemented, and the main premise on which microfinance programs are based is that the\npoor are credit-constrained and have limited access to formal sector credit. In Thailand, however,\nthe Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) claims to serve over 80 percent\nof rural households. Hence, it is possible that the rural poor in Thailand are not credit-constrained.\nHowever, the BAAC\u2019s outreach in the northeast, the country\u2019s poorest region, is smaller than the\nrest of the country. In the 14 villages surveyed for this study, 63 percent of village households\nwere BAAC members. Moreover, as is often the case in government-led credit programs, the BAAC\u2019s\nclientele is largely male; only 29.5 percent of surveyed BAAC members were women. Hence, only\n18.6 percent of surveyed households included women who had access to BAAC loans. On the other\nhand, 25.8 percent of surveyed households included women who were in debt to moneylenders.\nAt the time of the surveys, BAAC\u2019s annual interest rate varied from 3 to 12 percent, whereas\nmoneylenders charged between 60 and 120 percent per year, and the NGO programs evaluated\nin this paper charged 24 percent per year. Hence, there is evidence that women in Northeast\nThailand may be credit-constrained and may benefit from access to lower-cost institutional credit.\nThe main problems plaguing attempts to evaluate the targeting and impact of microfinance\nprograms are that participants self-select and program placement might be endogenous.3  It is,\ntherefore, likely that there are significant unobservable differences between participants and\nnonparticipants (e.g., entrepreneurship, risk preferences, attitudes regarding the role of women\nin the household, attitudes toward belonging to a poverty lending group), which make direct\ncomparison of participants and nonparticipants biased. Similarly, endogenous program placement\nwill bias attempts to compare program and nonprogram villages. Coleman (1999), using the same\ndata set examined in this paper, demonstrates the extent to which uncorrected estimates\nsignificantly overestimate average program impact.\n3  For a thorough econometric discussion of the issues involved, see Pitt and Khandker (1998) and Coleman (1999).\n2", "Section II\nThe NGO Programs Studied\nThis paper extends and refines the methodology used in Coleman (1999) to evaluate targeting\nand differential impact on different classes of participants. Results indicate that self-selected\nprogram participants are significantly wealthier than nonparticipants even prior to program\nintervention, and the wealthiest villagers are almost twice as likely to participate in the program\nthan the poorer villagers. Moreover, some of the wealthiest villagers obtain a disproportionate\nshare of program loan volume by virtue of holding influential positions as village bank committee\nmembers.  Positive impact is seen largely in this wealthier group. Impact on rank and file members\nis significantly smaller than impact on the wealthy, and is largely insignificant. Hence, similar\nto previous attempts to deliver low-cost credit to the poor, most of the benefits in the village banks\nstudied are going to the wealthiest villagers.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sections II to IV describe the design\nof the programs studied, survey design and data, and survey area. Section V presents results relating\nto participation, including member selection and borrowing, while Section VI presents results on\nprogram impact. Section VII concludes and discusses policy implications.\nII. THE NGO PROGRAMS STUDIED\nThe two microfinance programs studied are run by Thai NGOs: the Rural Friends\nAssociation (RFA), located in the northeast province of Surin, and the Foundation for Integrated\nAgricultural Management (FIAM), located in the adjacent province of Roi-Et. RFA and FIAM have\npromoted microfinance since 1988 and receive financial and technical assistance from the American\nNGO Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Both Thai NGOs follow the \u201cvillage bank\u201d group lending\nmethodology of the Foundation for International Community Assistance (see FINCA 1990 and\nHatch 1989), in which borrowers (all women) form their own peer groups of 20 to 60 members.\nSmaller solidarity groups are generally not used, although some of the sampled village banks\nindependently formed such groups. The NGO grants a loan simultaneously to each member, but\ngroup members co-guarantee each other\u2019s loans. If the group does not meet its collective\nresponsibility to repay all of its members\u2019 loans, then all group members are denied future credit.\nThe first loan is the same amount for all members (1500 baht).4  For each subsequent\nloan cycle, the member is entitled to borrow an amount equal to her previous loan plus her\naccumulated savings in the village bank, up to a fixed maximum (7500 baht). Moreover, the group\nalso makes loans to its members (and sometimes to nonmembers) from its members\u2019 savings. Loans\nfrom the NGO lender are \u201cexternal account\u201d loans, and loans from members\u2019 savings are \u201cinternal\naccount\u201d loans. External account loans must be repaid in 6 months.5  External account loans are\n4 In 1995-1996, US$1 = 25 baht.\n5 In three of the older village banks surveyed, 4-month loan cycles were used for the first year. Subsequently,\nthe NGOs switched to 6-month loan cycles in response to member demand.\n3", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nmade for 5 years, after which time the funds used for external account lending are used to finance\nnew village banks, and the internal account built up is supposed to continue to finance the village\nbank members\u2019 needs.6  The interest rate charged on external account loans is 2 percent per month,\nwith both principal and interest due at term.7 The interest rate on internal account loans is\ndetermined by each village bank, but is generally also set at 2 percent per month, although some\nvillage banks set it at 3 percent per month. At the time of the surveys, RFA had a 97 percent\non-time repayment rate on its external account loans, and FIAM had a 100 percent on-time\nrepayment rate. Savings are not mandatory, but are encouraged in two ways. First, external account\nborrowing rights grow with increasing savings; and second, the profits from internal account lending\nare allocated among members according to the amount of their savings.\nGroup formation and membership was generally determined as follows. The initial contact\nbetween NGO and village could be initiated either by the NGO or by the village, but almost always\ninvolved contacts between the NGO and \u201cleading members\u201d of the village. As is customary and\nnecessary in Thailand, the NGO fieldworker\u2019s first visit to the village would include a visit to\nthe village chief to introduce the purpose of the visit. Frequently, the task of assembling and\norganizing the village women into a village bank group would be delegated to the village\nleadership\u2014either the village chief or a female leader designated by him. The role of the field\nworker was, therefore, frequently reduced to explaining the program to the group thus formed,\nand to administering the delivery of loans and collection of repayments. In three of the villages\nsurveyed, however, the other extreme was observed\u2014namely that the field workers, who were\nresident in the villages, handpicked the women to join the program.\nEach village bank was managed by a committee comprised of a president, vice president,\ntreasurer, and other officers. These committee members make most of the day-to-day decisions,\nincluding (importantly) decisions on membership, borrowing eligibility, and allocation of loans.\nIn principle, the committee membership was elected annually, but in practice the leading women\ndesignated to organize the village bank became committee members and remained in their positions\nfrom year to year.8\nIII. SURVEY DESIGN AND DATA\nA total of  445 households in 14 villages in Northeast Thailand were surveyed in 1995-\n1996. Eight of the villages were supported by RFA, and the other six were supported by FIAM.\n6 Interestingly, final-period external account loans were always paid back in full, contradicting the economic\ntheory that finite-period games would lead to default. Clearly, the villagers either feel a moral obligation to\nrepay, are concerned with their long-term reputations with the NGOs, or have not been properly educated on\nthe subject of finite-period games!\n7 Originally, interest payments were made at weekly meetings, but were eliminated due to member demand.\nMeeting frequency was also reduced from weekly to monthly. However, with all payments due every six months,\nthere is often little business to conduct at the monthly meetings, which are therefore poorly attended.\n8 There was occasionally some shifting within the committee\u2014e.g., the president and treasurer swapping positions.\n4", "Section IV\nSurvey Area\nOf the 14 villages surveyed, six had never benefited from village bank support, and did not receive\nany village bank loans during the survey period. These \u201ccontrol\u201d villages were identified as follows.\nBased on their expansion plans, RFA pre-identified four villages and FIAM pre-identified two\nthat they would begin supporting in 1996. In February and March 1995, RFA and FIAM field\nstaff organized the villagers into the new village banks, allowing them to self-select according\nto standard procedures, the only difference being that the villagers were told that loans would\nnot begin for approximately one year.\nA random sample of eight \u201ctreatment\u201d villages (four each from RFA and FIAM) was also\nchosen from a list of their village banks (32 for RFA and 26 for FIAM). One other village that\nwas just due to begin receiving loans was also included to serve as a control village for certain\npurposes9 and to observe the initial development of a new village bank.\nA stratified random sample based on participant status of 505 households was obtained\nfrom all 14 villages. Of these, 455 were located by the enumerators and agreed to be interviewed\nduring the first survey, and 445 (including 294 program participants and 151 nonparticipants)\nfinished the surveys.\nEach village was surveyed four times over a year. The first survey was conducted in April\n1995 and collected data on household demographics, assets, and debts. The second, third, and\nfourth surveys were conducted in August 1995, October 1995, and February-March 1996,\nrespectively. They collected data on income, expenditures, and credit transactions during the dry\nseason (February to May), the rainy season (June to September), and the harvest season (October\nto January). In addition to the household surveys, village surveys were also conducted to collect\ndata on village infrastructure, prices, and other characteristics. The household surveys were\nadministered by the staff of RFA in Surin and FIAM in Roi-Et, under the author\u2019s supervision.10\nThe author conducted the village surveys as well as in-depth informal interviews with numerous\nvillagers.\nIV. SURVEY AREA\nThe provinces of Surin and Roi-Et are adjacent to each other and are located in Northeast\nThailand, the country\u2019s poorest region. Most village households engage in small-scale agriculture:\n90.4 percent of men and 91.3 percent of women in the households surveyed listed farming as their\nprimary or secondary occupation. In Surin, rainfed rice is the primary crop, with planting in June\n9 This village bank opened in April 1995 and is, depending on the empirical test being conducted, sometimes a\ntreatment village and sometimes a control village. For example, when estimating the impact of village bank\nloans on various assets, as measured by the first survey, it is a control village since it had not yet benefited\nfrom village bank loans. But when estimating the impact on income or expenditures over the 12-month survey\nperiod, it is a treatment village since its first two 6-month loans would have impacted income during this period.\n10Questionnaires were checked for internal consistency in the villages immediately upon completion of an interview.\nApproximately 20 percent were subsequently checked for content in follow-up interviews.\n5", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nand harvesting from November to January. During the off-season, a few households engage in\nsmall-scale irrigated gardening, but most either engage in nonagricultural income-generating\nactivities or remain idle. The more common activities include pig raising; itinerant wage labor\n(especially construction) in the provincial capital or Bangkok; and small business activities such\nas petty trading, driving a motorcycle taxi, spinning and weaving silk and cotton, and operating\nsmall food stands. Some of the wealthier households buy and sell cattle and water buffalo.\nAgricultural and nonagricultural activities in Roi-Et are similar to those in Surin, with two\ndifferences. First, another important crop cultivated during the main growing season is sticky\nrice. Second, because of different soil quality, tobacco is commonly grown as a cash crop during\nthe off season from November to April, leading to less migrant labor compared to Surin.\nMost people in Surin, which borders Cambodia, are ethnically Khmer (98 percent) and\nprimarily Khmer-speaking. The people of Roi-Et, like those in most of Northeast Thailand, are\nethnically Lao (98 percent) and the language spoken is a dialect of Lao. In both provinces, however,\nThai is understood and spoken by all but the oldest villagers.\nV. PARTICIPATION\nA. Selection of Members\nThe raison d\u2019\u00eatre of most microfinance programs is to correct market failure in delivering\ncredit to the rural poor. Most microfinance programs state that their primary goal is to alleviate\nrural poverty by delivering credit and other financial services to the poorest households, especially\nto the women in those households. This is certainly the case for the programs studied in this paper.\nFor example, Catholic Relief Services publishes \u201cEight Principles of Village Banking\u201d, the first\nof which is to loan to \u201cthe poorest of the poor.\u201d FINCA (1989) lists several \u201ccriteria for membership\nselection,\u201d one of which is that membership should be \u201copen to poorest-of-the-poor, but not\nexclusively for poor\u201d although \u201cultimately, membership is self-selecting and not responsibility of\nsponsoring agency.\u201d\nThe poor are generally targeted by group lending programs in one of two ways. In a minority\nof programs, such as the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, households owning assets valued at more\nthan a certain amount are in principle excluded from participating in the program.11  The majority\nof group lending programs, however, do not set strict eligibility criteria. Instead, they seek to target\nthe poor and screen out the wealthy indirectly (i) by setting small loan sizes (e.g., $50 to $300)\n11For example, households owning assets that are worth more than the value of one acre of land are theoretically\nineligible to join the Grameen Bank. Two other Bangladeshi group lending programs, the Bangladesh Rural\nAdvancement Committee (BRAC) and the Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB), deem ineligible\nhouseholds that own more than 0.5 acres of land. Morduch (1999), however, shows that these eligibility criteria\nare not perfectly enforced, and some 18 to 32 percent of participants do not meet the eligibility criteria.\n6", "Section V\nParticipation\nthat would presumably be of little interest to the wealthy; (ii) by requiring frequent group meetings\n(usually weekly or monthly) that would impose a cost on the wealthy in excess of any benefit they\nmight derive from the small loans; and (iii) by the stigma of participating in a \u201cpoverty lending\u201d\nprogram. This second, indirect, screening method is part of the \u201cvillage bank\u201d model of group lending\npioneered by FINCA and adopted by most international NGOs such as Catholic Relief Services,\nCARE, Save the Children, and Freedom From Hunger. It is therefore important to determine\nwhether or not the self-selection process allows NGOs to reach their target group of \u201cthe poorest\nof the poor\u201d.\nMost existing studies on program impact have ignored the issue of program targeting. These\ninclude, for example, the 32 studies reviewed in Sebstad and Chen (1996) (with the exception of\nMkNelly and Watetip 1993 discussed in greater detail below), the 11 studies reviewed in Chen\n(1992), and the studies by Wydick (1995a and 1995c), Pitt and Khandker (1998), and Khandker\n(2001).\nExceptions to this neglect include MkNelly and Watetip\u2019s (1993) study of village banks\nin Northeast Thailand (not far from where the current study was conducted), Perry\u2019s (1995)\nanthropological study of village banks in Senegal, Park and Ren\u2019s (2001) study of microfinance\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Amin et al.\u2019s (1999) Bangladesh study. MkNelly and\nWatetip find that village bank members closely match a general cross section of the village. They\nuse an innovative survey of village chiefs regarding the wealth level of member and nonmember\nhouseholds in the village. However, they conduct their study three years after the establishment\nof the village banks. Hence, differences in wealth would have been influenced by the village bank\nitself. Moreover, politically savvy village chiefs might have deduced that the \u201ccorrect\u201d response\nis that village bank members are poorer than nonmembers (or, if the chiefs are concerned about\nimpact, they might respond that participants are the wealthier villagers). The shortcomings of\nthis method are underscored by Perry\u2019s (1995) study in Senegal. She found that, in response to\nopen-ended questions, focus groups of village bank members asserted that the wealthy do not\ndominate village bank membership. However, her more objective measurements of wealth\ndemonstrated that the wealthy in fact did have more access to membership and to borrowing.\nThe studies by Park and Ren (2001) and Amin et al. (1999) also evaluate targeting by comparing\nparticipants and nonparticipants after program effects have been realized, potentially biasing the\nresults.\nAs these studies demonstrate, the main problem plaguing attempts to evaluate program\ntargeting is that most empirical studies have focused on impact; therefore, data have been collected\nafter the programs have been operating for some time. Differences between participants and\nnonparticipants are therefore corrupted by the effects of the program.\nThe Thai data set collected for the present study, however, provides an ideal setting to\nstudy issues of self-selection and targeting because the sample includes seven villages where\nvillagers are self-selected but had not received village bank loans at the time of the first survey.\nDifferences in wealth of members and nonmembers can be directly compared in these villages.\nIn addition, data for all households surveyed was collected on land owned 5 years before the surveys,\n7", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\ni.e., land owned before any of the 14 villages had a village bank.12  Because land value makes\nup 73.7 percent of the value of household assets in the sample, the value of land owned 5 years\nbefore the surveys is an excellent proxy for prior household wealth.13\nIt should be kept in mind in what follows that a villager can become a member only if\nshe self-selects and is selected by her peers. Hence, to refer to the selection process as \u201cself-selection\u201d\ncan be misleading; selection by peers may be the more important process. Table 1 below presents\nweighted14 t-tests on total wealth, land value, and the value of nonland assets (total and by gender\nof the owner) for households in the seven villages that had not received village bank support at\nthe time of the first survey. Table 2 presents weighted t-tests on land value (total and by gender)\nfor all 14 villages 5 years before our surveys.\nTable 1: Weighted t-tests on Wealth of Members and Nonmembers\nin Control Villages\nVariable (in baht) Village Bank Nonmembers P-value of\nMembers (n=140) (n=70) Difference\nHousehold wealth (assets less debt) 574,738 434,154 .157\nFemale-owned wealth (assets less debt) 303,482 191,327 .055\nMale-owned wealth (assets less debt) 264,810 237,635 .740\nValue of household land 442,814 271,370 .028\nValue of female-owned land 254,089 128,560 .019\nValue of male-owned land 187,413 142,810 .455\nValue of household nonland assets 172,114 201,354 .476\nValue of female-owned nonland assets 61,604 76,252 .376\nValue of male-owned nonland assets 104,548 119,910 .670\nTable 2: Weighted t-tests on Land Value of Members and Nonmembers\nin All Villages 5 Years before Surveys\nVariable (in baht) Village Bank Nonmembers P-value of\nmembers (n=294) (n=151) difference\nValue of household land 480,745 249,604 .001\nValue of female-owned land 301,816 109,774 .001\nValue of male-owned land 176,624 137,851 .382\n12Collecting data on land owned 5 years earlier is relatively easy. Because land transactions tend to be large\nand important yet relatively infrequent for a household, a household can easily recall land transactions made\nin the previous 5 years, and land owned (and its value) 5 years earlier can be deduced.\n13Land value 5 years before our surveys is also an important regressor in estimating village bank impact on\nvarious outcomes as it controls for initial wealth in all households (see Section 6 below).\n14Observations from each of 28 strata (determined by village and village bank membership status) were weighted\nby the inverse of their sampling probabilities.\n8", "Section V\nParticipation\nTables 1 and 2 show that village bank members, prior to any village bank support, tend\nto be wealthier than nonmembers. Furthermore, the wealth difference comes primarily through\nthe value of land owned by women in the household.15\nAn alternative, and perhaps better, way to examine targeting is to examine the probability\nof selection by different wealth groups. Examining the selection process in this way with the current\ndata set is complicated by the stratification process used. Because stratification was based on\nparticipation status, the probability of selecting into the program has to be calculated using the\nprobability that a member (or nonmember) belongs to a certain wealth category, adjusted by the\nprobability of being sampled. Table 3 below presents the results.\nTable 3.  Probability of Members of Different Wealth Groups\nGaining Access to Program\nWealth Group (value of household Total Number Total Total Non- Percent of\nland owned 5 years earlier, baht)  of Households Participating participating Wealth Group\nin Sample Households Participating in\nVillages    Program\n0 (landless) 143 65 78 45\n0 to 99,999 257 108 149 42\n100,000 to 199,999 264 111 153 42\n200,000 to 399,999 351 137 214 39\n400,000 to 999,999 282 153 129 54\nGreater than or equal to 1,000,000 72 58 14 81\nAs this table shows, the probability of selecting into the program is much higher for the\ntwo wealthiest groups of villagers, and the probability of the wealthiest group selecting into the\nprogram is nearly twice that of the four poorer groups.\nIt is still possible, however, that wealth per se (and female land wealth in particular) is\nnot a significant determinant of member selection. For example, it is conceivable that the primary\ncriteria for membership are personal responsibility, trustworthiness, entrepreneurship, and an\nassortment of other unobservable characteristics that lead to the selection bias discussed earlier,\nand which are correlated with wealth. Therefore, as part of the field research, two knowledgeable\ninformants in every village (the village chief and village bank president) were interviewed about\nthe creditworthiness of each household surveyed. Specifically they were asked, \u201cIf the adult women\nin this household borrowed money from any source (private bank, BAAC, friend, relative,\nmoneylender, or any other source) how sure would you be that they would repay the amount due\non time? Very sure=3, fairly sure=2, or not very sure=1.\u201d By this question, a measure of each\n15Whereas households sometimes had trouble designating an individual owner of nonland assets, they rarely\nhad trouble designating an individual owner of each plot of land. Moreover, since Thailand is traditionally a\nmatrilineal society, with land being passed down through the woman\u2019s side of the family, it should not be\nsurprising that women own more land than men.\n9", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nhousehold\u2019s reputation for creditworthiness was obtained, which would presumably be a major\ncriterion in determining which women in the village would be allowed to join the village bank.\nIt is intended to be a proxy for many of the unobservable characteristics discussed above. A\ncreditworthiness score was then calculated as the average of the informants\u2019 responses for each\nhousehold.\nResults of weighted16 logit regressions on member selection using this and other household\ncharacteristics are presented in Annex Table 2. Estimates in the left-hand portion of the table\nuse data only from the control villages and include the value of land and nonland assets owned\nwhen the first survey began. Similar estimates using the entire sample but slightly different\nregressors (namely, land owned 5 years before our survey, i.e., the initial wealth measure exogenous\nfor all households) are presented in the right-hand portion of the table.17  Both regressions yield\nsimilar results, showing that creditworthiness is a significant determinant of member selection\n(in control villages: coef=.709 and p=.046; in all villages: coef=.384 and p=.097), so local information\napparently is being used in the selection process. At the same time, however, even controlling\nfor this use of local information, the value of land owned by women is still highly significant (in\ncontrol villages: coef=2.73x10-6 and p=.025; in all villages: coef=2.44x10-6 and p=.001).\nThis evidence that the village banks are failing to reach the poor is also supported by\ninformal interviews with villagers. For example, when asked what kind of person joined the village\nbank, many nonmembers in two treatment villages identified the village bank as a \u201cgroup for the\nrich\u201d and that they would \u201cnot be qualified to join\u201d although they would be interested in joining\nsuch a group for poor people. In five other villages (two control and three treatment), nonmembers\nmade similar remarks that suggested that the program was open primarily to the richer households\nin the village. None of the villagers interviewed identified the village bank as a program that\ntargeted the poor.18\nAs mentioned in Section II above, in most villages the NGO field worker\u2019s first contact\nwas with the village chief, and after this contact, the NGO field worker usually was uninvolved\nin member selection, leaving it up to the village chief to organize the villagers. The village chief\nwould normally then contact \u201cleading women\u201d in the village to assist in the organization of the\nvillage bank. The village chiefs and leading women were generally among the wealthiest and most\n16 Sampling weights (the inverse of the probability of being sampled) were applied to the data for these logit\nregressions because stratification was done on the dependent variable (member status). Weighting is not required\nin the impact regressions (see below) because stratification was done on the exogenous variables (Maddala\n1983, 170).\n17 The estimates on the right-hand side of Annex Table 2, however, are possibly biased because \u201ccreditworthiness\u201d\nis likely to be endogenous for the village bank members in treatment villages: the village chief\u2019s and village\nbank president\u2019s assessment of their creditworthiness would be influenced by their performance in the village\nbank.\n18 This result is interesting, especially when compared with the methodology of Park and Ren (2001), who evaluate\ntargeting and impact in the PRC using respondents\u2019 own subjective determination of their \u201celigibility\u201d in programs\nthat do not have explicit eligibility criteria.\n10", "Section V\nParticipation\ninfluential residents of the village (and the women were often relatives of the village chief), and\nthe other women they asked to join were also richer than average.\nFrequently, the village chief\u2019s wife was the village bank president or held another influential\ncommittee position, and other wealthy leading women in the village also usually became committee\nmembers. Their influence continued beyond the selection of members to the determination of the\namounts of money that they and other members borrowed. We now turn to this process.\nA. Borrowing by Members\nOne of the more fascinating phenomena discovered during the course of the surveys is\nthe extent to which village bank members use other names, in addition to their own, to borrow\nfrom the village bank. For example, sometimes when a member does not want to borrow, she will\nlet another member use her name to borrow from the village bank. Of more importance, however,\nis the use of multiple names to borrow. For instance, some members also enroll as \u201cmembers\u201d a\nrelative who may or may not live with the borrower. In other instances, a member will take over\nthe account of a member who leaves the village bank. Virtually all of the members who used multiple\nnames to borrow from the village bank on a more or less permanent basis were also influential\ncommittee members (president, vice president, or treasurer of the village bank), who set village\nbank policy (especially regarding management and lending of the internal account funds), and\nmanaged daily operations. Committee members in six of the eight treatment villages engaged\nin this practice. The use of multiple names has a large impact on the amount that a member can\nborrow, effectively multiplying the maximum loan size by the number of names used. In the most\nextreme case, one village bank president (who was also the village chief\u2019s business partner and\na moneylender for several villages in the area) used nine names to borrow. Households reported\nthat 35 percent of loan volume in the eight treatment villages was borrowed by someone other\nthan the person recorded in the village bank records. Even this estimate is probably low because\nsome villagers reported that they had been instructed not to report the use of multiple names.\nIn principle, the most important determinant of a member\u2019s cumulative borrowing is the\nlength of time she has been a member. Borrowing by members is estimated in Annex Tables 3\nthrough 5, using as regressors various household characteristics, the number of months of\nmembership as a rank and file member, and the number of months as a committee member. Annex\nTable 3 presents results for external account borrowing; Annex Table 4 presents results for internal\naccount borrowing; and Annex Table 5 presents results for total borrowing (external plus internal\naccount). The left-hand portion of each table presents results when the dependent variable is\nborrowing according to official records. The right-hand portion adjusts the dependent variable\nfor use of multiple names to borrow. F-tests of the hypothesis that \u201cmonths as a rank and file\nmember\u201d and \u201cmonths as a committee member\u201d are equal determinants of borrowing are presented\nat the end of each table.\nThe results show the extent to which committee members borrow more than rank and\nfile members and the extent to which this difference is magnified when adjusting for the use of\n11", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nmultiple names. In the adjusted (right column) borrowing equations, committee members borrow\nmore than twice as much as rank and file members: real external account borrowing increases\nby 4953 baht per month for a committee member, and by 2359 baht for a rank and file member.\nInternal account borrowing increases by 8704 baht per month for a committee member, and by\n4236 baht for a rank and file member. Combined borrowing increases by 5960 baht per month\nfor a rank and file member, and by 12,982 baht per month for a committee member.19  For both\nexternal and internal account borrowing, the p-value on the difference between the coefficients\nis 0.0. Overall, committee members, who make up 15.6 percent of the treatment village bank\nmembers (and 3 percent of all households in treatment villages), borrowed 27.0 percent of total\nloan volume.\nGiven the large and significant difference in borrowing by rank and file members and\ncommittee members, combined with the goal of targeting the poor, the question naturally arises\nas to whether committee members are richer or poorer than rank and file members prior to village\nbank intervention. Tables 4 and 5 present t-tests on the same wealth measures used in Tables\n1 and 2 above, but now test for differences between committee members and rank and file members.\nTable 4: Weighted t-tests on Wealth of Committee and Rank\nand File Members in Control Villages\nVariable (in baht) Committee Rank and P-value of\nMembers File Members Difference\n(n=16) (n=124)\nHousehold wealth (assets less debt) 859,747 554,180 .145\nFemale-owned wealth (assets less debt) 546,426 302,851 .196\nMale-owned wealth (assets less debt) 312,977 244,190 .575\nValue of household land 722,225 422,115 .141\nValue of female-owned land 495,413 253,480 .189\nValue of male-owned land 226,813 166,619 .602\nValue of household nonland assets 224,630 171,554 .207\nValue of female-owned nonland assets 59,686 64,143 .864\nValue of male-owned nonland assets 164,601 101,016 .061\nTable 5: Weighted t-tests on Land Value of Committee and Rank\nand File Members in All Villages 5 Years before Surveys\nVariable (in baht) Committee Rank and P-value of\nMembers File Members Difference\n (n=40) (n=254)\nValue of household land 729,190 409,354 .033\nValue of female-owned land 481,140 264,144 .093\nValue of male-owned land 248,050 141,392 .208\n19Borrowing is actually measured in baht-months to account for the different lengths of time that money is borrowed.\nFor example, 1000 baht borrowed for 6 months is 6000 baht-months. This measure is necessary because early\nexternal account loan cycles lasted 4 months but were subsequently adjusted to 6 months in response to client\ndemand. However, the results are robust to other measures of borrowing (e.g., average loan size outstanding).\n12", "Section VI\nImpact\nOn virtually all measures, committee members are wealthier before village bank\nintervention. When examining differences only in the control villages (Table 3), however, only\none difference is significant beyond the .14 level\u2014almost certainly because of the small number\nof committee members (n=16) from those villages in the sample. When using land value 5 years\nbefore our surveys, however, and expanding the sample to include treatment villages, the difference\nin total land value is significant at the .03 level, and the difference in female-owned land value\nis significant at the .09 level.\nHence, there is evidence that the wealthiest households in the villages play a dominant\nrole in the village banks, and use their positions to borrow significantly more than rank and file\nmembers. In some villages, this phenomenon caused serious problems between committee members\nand rank and file members. For example, one of the oldest village banks in the sample originally\nhad over 70 members, but at the time of our surveys, the number was 40. Many of the original\nmembers resigned because they were angry that the president (who was also the village chief\u2019s\nwife) and treasurer were borrowing much more than they.20   In another village, some rank and\nfile members resented the fact that committee members \u201crounded down\u201d members\u2019 external account\nloan amounts (e.g., from 2230 baht to 2000 baht), ostensibly because it was easier to calculate\ninterest payments. The surplus, which could be large when all members\u2019 loans were considered,\nwas then loaned out by the committee members to themselves, the village chief, or others of their\nchoosing. A small number of members had resigned as a result. In several villages, some members\nwho had resigned were surprised and angered to learn during the interviews that their names\nwere still being used to borrow without their knowledge or permission.\nVI. IMPACT\nColeman (1999) demonstrates that the unique survey design of this study can be exploited\nto obtain unbiased (in the case of uncensored dependent variables) or consistent (in the case of\ncensored dependent variables) estimates of average program impact with the following specification:\nY  = X \u03b1 + V\u03b2 + M \u03b3 + VBMOS \u03b4 + \u03b7 (1)\nij ij j ij ij ij\nwhere Yij is an outcome of household i in village j on which we want to measure program impact;\nXij is a vector of household characteristics; Vj is a vector of village fixed effects (village dummy\n20Members in this and other villages were primarily angry over internal account borrowing since the NGO still\nprovided the rank-and-file members with the external account loans they were entitled to. Internal account\nlending policy is determined in principle by the village bank membership, but in practice by the committee\nmembers. An examination of Annex Table 4 shows that in fact no household characteristics other than \u201cmonths\nas a rank and file member\u201d and \u201cmonths as a committee member\u201d have a significant impact on credit demand\nfrom the internal account, demonstrating the dominant role of committee members in allocating internal account\nfunds.\n13", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nvariables); Mij is a membership dummy variable equal to 1 if household ij selects into the\nmicrofinance program, and 0 otherwise; and VBMOSij is the number of months village bank credit\nhas been available to members. The membership dummy variable Mij is a proxy for the unobservable\ncharacteristics that lead a household to self-select into the village bank and that might affect\noutcomes. It is important to recognize that it equals 1 for both \u201ctreatment\u201d members (who have\nreceived program support) and \u201ccontrol\u201d members (who have not yet received program support).\nThe variable VBMOSij measures the extent of program availability to members who have self-\nselected. Unlike the amount borrowed, it is exogenous to the household (positive in varying amounts\nfor treatment members, and 0 for control members). Inclusion of nonparticipants in the sample,\ncombined with the use of village fixed effects, controls for possible endogenous program placement.\nIn this specification, d is an unbiased or consistent measure of impact per month of program\navailability.\nColeman (1999) found that, when controlling for endogenous member selection and program\nplacement, average program impact was not significant. Final impact estimation, however, must\naccount for the apparent difference in access to loans by rank and file members and committee\nmembers, who may therefore experience different levels of impact. Because of this difference, the\nempirical specification of equation (1) will be modified as follows. First, the dummy variable Mij\nwill be replaced by two dummy variables: a rank and file member dummy variable to capture\nunobservable differences between rank and file members and nonmembers, and a committee\nmember dummy variable to capture similar unobservable differences between rank and file and\ncommittee members.21  Second, the regressor VBMOSij will be replaced by two regressors: months\nof rank and file membership and months of committee membership, which will allow for differential\nimpact to be measured on rank and file members and committee members. Hence, the empirical\nspecification to be estimated in this paper is as follows:\nY  = X \u03b1 + V\u03b2 + MR \u03b3  + MC \u03b3  + RMOS \u03b4  + CMOS \u03b4  + \u00b5 (2)\nij ij j ij R ij C ij R ij C ij\nwhere MRij is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the household has a rank and file member and 0\notherwise; MCij is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the household has a village bank committee\nmember and 0 otherwise; RMOSij is the number of months of rank and file membership; CMOSij\nis the number of months of committee membership; and the other variables are defined as before.\nAgain, MRij and MCij equal 1 for treatment and control participants, and equal 0 for nonparticipants\nin all villages. RMOSij and CMOSij measure the different access to program loans by rank and\nfile and committee members, respectively, and are exogenous to the household (equal to 0 for\n21 As mentioned in Section II, committee members are chosen every year, which in theory could bias the results\nbecause in the control villages, we know the committee members only for the first year. In practice, however,\nthe committee members rarely change. In six of the treatment villages, the committee has not changed at all;\nin the two other treatment villages, there have been only minor changes, with many of the core committee\nmembers only shifting committee positions (e.g., president to vice president).\n14", "Section VI\nImpact\nnonparticipants and treatment participants, but positive and varying for treatment participants).\nInclusion of nonparticipants in the sample, combined with the use of village fixed effects, again\ncontrols for possible endogenous program placement. In this specification, dR measures the impact\nof an additional month\u2019s program availability to a rank and file member; and dC measures the\nimpact of an additional month\u2019s program availability to a committee member. F-tests can be\nconducted to determine if dR = dC, i.e., if the impact of the village bank on rank and file members\nand committee members is equal.\nAnnex Table 6 presents the complete output of a typical regression (for household nonland\nassets), and Annex Table 7 presents the coefficients and associated p-values for the regressors\nof interest (months of rank and file membership and months of committee membership) in all\nthe regressions.22\nA. Impact on Rank and File Members\nThe results presented in Annex Table 7 for rank and file members are consistent with\nthe average impacts found in Coleman (1999), i.e., the impact estimates are largely insignificantly\ndifferent from 0. In fact, the only measures that are significantly different from 0 indicate a negative\nimpact. It is remarkable to note that men\u2019s overall self-employment expenses (coef=-9986; p=.077)\nare negative and statistically significant, and men\u2019s overall self-employment sales (coef.=-11,023;\np=.106) are negative and nearly significant at the 10 percent level. Estimated impact on men\u2019s\nagricultural expenses and business sales and expenses, including labor time are all negative and\nstatistically significant, and estimated impact on all other measures of men\u2019s economic activity\nis also negative though not statistically significant. Assuming that men\u2019s leisure is a normal good,\nthese results may represent (expected) income effects of providing low-cost credit to women:\nessentially, women\u2019s increased income generated by access to program credit could provide men\nwith economic rents taken in the form of increased leisure. Unfortunately, however, these rents\nappear to be perceived rather than realized, as the measured impact on women\u2019s outcomes in rank\nand file households is not significant.\nAnother important, and potentially ominous, result is the lack of impact on savings for\nrank and file members. In fact, measured impact is negative, though insignificantly different from\nzero. One possible explanation for this result is that, especially after the third year, members\nhave reduced incentive to save. Recall that external account loan size grows according to a member\u2019s\nsavings, up to a maximum of 7500 baht. In practice, however, although external account loans\nare made for 5 years, the NGOs start reducing loan size after the third year, so as to gradually\nwean members from external account loans. Hence, members have little incentive (in term of access\n22Variables were entered in linear form. In the vast majority of regressions, no additional explanatory value\nwas gained by introducing nonlinearities. Note also that the dependent variables presented in Annex Table\n7 are not independent of each other. Most aggregate variables (e.g., total household wealth) are broken down\ninto more refined measures (e.g., women\u2019s wealth, total household productive assets, men\u2019s business assets,\netc.) in order to identify exactly where the impacts occur.\n15", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nto external account loans) to continue to save after a certain point.23  Moreover, because member\nsavings make up the internal account fund, and because this fund is often monopolized by the\ncommittee members, rank and file members may be further inclined to reduce their village bank\nsavings.24  This lack of impact on mobilizing savings from rank and file members could have major\nconsequences because the long-term sustainability of village banks depends on the sustainability\nof their internal account funds.\nB. Impact on Committee Members\nEstimated impact on committee members, however, is significant and positive on a range\nof dependent variables. Impact results are presented below under the headings of physical assets;\nsavings, debt, and lending; production, sales, expenses, and labor time; and health care and\neducation.\n1. Physical Assets\nThe village banks appear to have had a large and positive impact on the value of committee\nmembers\u2019 household wealth (coef=3010; p=.043), and this impact is seen primarily on women\u2019s\nwealth (coef=1705; p=.076). Broken down further into landed wealth and nonland assets, there\nis a positive and significant impact on total household nonland assets (coef=3187; p=.018).\nInterestingly, this effect is most pronounced for men\u2019s nonland assets (coef=2122; p=.071), although\nfurther refinements indicate positive and significant effects on women\u2019s productive assets (coef=870;\np=.014) , including nonland farm assets (coef=329; p=.100) and consumer durables (coef=755; p=.026).\nF-tests shown in the last two columns of Annex Table 7 indicate that the impact on committee\nmembers is significantly greater than that on rank and file on many of these wealth measures\n(household and women\u2019s wealth, household  and women\u2019s nonland assets, household and women\u2019s\nproductive assets, household and men\u2019s livestock, and women\u2019s consumer durables).\n23 Nonlinear specifications, however, did not add any explanatory value.\n24 The advantage of having a saving facility in the village was also virtually eliminated in two village banks\nsurveyed, largely because of policies set by the committee. In one village, members were not allowed to save\nonly\u2014all members were required to borrow from the NGO, even if they did not want to. The reason given by\nthe committee members was that it would be \u201cimpolite\u201d for members to refuse the assistance offered. Twenty\nof this village bank\u2019s 30 members regularly had to borrow from moneylenders to repay their village bank loans.\nIn another village bank, the president decided to pay members their end-of-year interest income, not based\non average yearly savings, but (ostensibly for ease of calculation) on savings on 31 December. She then greatly\nincreased her own savings on 28 December so as to increase her share of interest income.\n16", "Section VI\nImpact\n2. Savings, Debt, and Lending\nThe impact of the village banks on household savings is positive and significant for committee\nhouseholds (551; p=.073). This effect appears to come not only from the impact on women\u2019s savings\n(217; p=.118), but also on men\u2019s savings (425; p=.161), although neither gender\u2019s individual\ncoefficients are significantly different from zero. F-tests show that the impact on committee\nhousehold savings is significantly greater than the impact on rank and file household savings.\nAccording to NGO staff, a primary goal of these village bank programs is to allow members\nto reduce their high-interest debt to moneylenders. Hence, the village bank\u2019s impact was estimated\non \u201chigh-interest\u201d debt, defined as debt with an interest rate greater than 2 percent per month,\nthe rate charged on external account loans. However, no coefficients were significantly different\nfrom 0, indicating that village bank credit is not substituting for high-interest credit.25  Also\nestimated was the impact on \u201clow-interest\u201d debt (debt with an interest rate less than or equal\nto 2 percent per month) to determine if village bank credit is merely substituting for existing sources\nof low-interest credit, or if it was allowing (or encouraging) households to mobilize additional\ninstitutional credit. Results indicate that committee member households are also increasing their\nlow-interest debt from other sources available to men in the household. This is an interesting\nand useful result for the following reason. The differential impacts measured between committee\nmembers and rank and file members could be the result of two different factors. One, it may be\nthe result of the differential access to funds as discussed above, and this differential impact allows\ncommittee members to invest in different types of projects, perhaps with different scale economies.\nTwo, it may be the result of different unobservable characteristics (e.g., entrepreneurship) that\ncan be harnessed or realized only by access to credit. The fact that access to village bank funds\nappears to be allowing or encouraging additional borrowing is one indication that committee\nmembers are investing in different types of projects, perhaps with larger fixed assets, which require\nlarger capital. This is also consistent with the result discussed above that women\u2019s productive\nassets are positively affected by the village bank. Hence, differential access to program loans does\nappear to matter.\nIn four of eight treatment villages and three of six control villages, at least one (and often\ntwo) committee member(s) engaged in money lending to some degree, and some nonmembers and\nrank and file members complained that committee members borrowed from the village bank, then\nlent the money at higher interest rates. Therefore, the impact of village bank loans on money\nlending was also estimated. As expected, there is evidence of positive impact on committee members\u2019\nmoney lending. The coefficient on the impact of committee months on household money lending\nis positive and highly significant (2653; p=.005), and this effect comes entirely through the women\nin the household (2093; p=.054).26  The difference between coefficients on committee and rank\nand file months for household lending with interest is also significant (p=.035).\n25Estimation of impact on male high-interest debt in committee households was not possible because only four\nsuch households had men with high-interest debt.\n26 Estimation of impact on men\u2019s money lending was impossible because of the small number of households reporting\nnonzero values.\n17", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\n3. Production, Sales, Expenses, and Labor Time\nAs Annex Table 7 indicates, the village banks have also exerted a positive and significant\nimpact on women\u2019s self-employment sales (2245; p=.023) and expenses (1520; p=.058) in committee\nhouseholds. F-tests indicate that the impact on sales and expenses of women in committee\nhouseholds is significantly greater than the corresponding measures for rank and file households\n(p=.058 for sales, and p=.051 for expenses). Refined impact estimates indicate a positive effect\non household agricultural production, household livestock production, women\u2019s livestock sales,\nand women\u2019s business sales and expenses in committee member households. All impact measures\nare significantly greater for committee members than rank and file members.\nThe impact on total household self-employment labor time in committee households is also\npositive and significant (coef=26.9; p=.058), apparently impacting both women\u2019s labor time (14.0;\np=.112) and men\u2019s time (12.9; p=.156), though the estimates by gender are not individually\nstatistically significant.\n4. Health Care and Education\nMost estimates of village bank impact on medical and school expenses (totals, by gender,\nand for children, by gender)27 in both committee households and rank and file households are\ninsignificantly different from zero. The one exception to this was educational expenses for boys\nin committee member households (coef=86.6; p=.035), perhaps indicative of the privileged status\nof boys in Northeastern Thai households.\nVII. SUMMARY AND POLICY CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has evaluated the targeting and impact of a women\u2019s group-lending program\nin Northeast Thailand. To do so, it exploited a unique survey sample that included program\nparticipants from \u201ctreatment\u201d villages that had already received program support, participants\nfrom control villages that had not yet received program support, and nonparticipants from both\ntypes of villages. Results were presented in terms of targeting (i.e., the processes of member selection\nand borrowing) to determine if the program has succeeded in reaching its target group of the \u201cpoorest\nof the poor\u201d, and in terms of impact on member households.\nThere is strong evidence that, similar to previous efforts to deliver financial services to\nthe rural poor in developing countries, the programs surveyed are not reaching the poor as much\nas the relatively wealthy. Weighted t-tests indicate that prior to program intervention, participant\nhouseholds are significantly wealthier than those of nonparticipants, and that the wealth difference\n27\u201cFemale medical expenses\u201d are expenses for women, but not necessarily paid by women. No attempt was made\nto learn which household members paid for the medical care. The same is true for school expenses.\n18", "Section VII\nSummary and Policy Conclusions\nis explained primarily by the value of female-owned land in the households. Moreover, the probability\nof wealthiest villagers selecting into the program is nearly twice that of the poorer villagers.\nWeighted logit estimates confirm that the value of female-owned land is a significant determinant\nof member selection. The same logit estimates, however, indicate that \u201ccreditworthiness\u201d of female\nhousehold members, as measured by a special survey of village informants, is also a significant\ndeterminant of member selection. Hence, there is evidence that both relatively public information\non land holdings (the same information most commonly used by commercial lending institutions\nin Thailand to select its rural customers) and local information on creditworthiness are being used\nto select village bank members.\nThere is also strong evidence that the richest village bank members become committee\nmembers (president, vice president, treasurer) and use their position to borrow significantly more\nfrom the village bank (both from the external account and the internal account) than rank and\nfile members. One method commonly employed by committee members to circumvent village bank\nexternal account borrowing limits is to use multiple village bank accounts, each under a different\nname.\nHence, it is clear that, within the context of Northeast Thailand, village banks\u2019 small loan\nsize and frequent meetings, as well as the stigma of belonging to a poverty lending program, do\nnot discourage the relatively rich villagers from participating in the village bank. Furthermore,\nalthough some of the poorer nonmembers reported choosing not to join the village bank, many\nothers were excluded against their wishes. Some never knew of the village bank before the surveys,\nwhile others felt intimidated to join because they considered the village bank to be a program\nfor the relatively wealthy in the village. Moreover, the process by which NGOs first contact the\nvillage political structure, represented by the village chief, and then allow him to organize the\nselection process likely contributes to the richest women in the village becoming committee members,\nwho then borrow the lion\u2019s share of village bank loans.\nResults indicate a positive impact of the village bank program on several measures of\nhousehold welfare. Given the difference in access to loans by committee members and rank and\nfile members, however, it is not surprising that estimated impact on committee members is\nsignificantly larger than impact on rank and file members. For example, positive and significant\nimpact is observed in committee member households on many important measures of wealth,\nsavings, income, productive expenses, and labor time. Impact is also positive on committee members\u2019\nmoneylending activities, as they apparently borrowed from the program at lower interest rates\nand relent at higher rates. Impact on outcomes for rank and file members was largely insignificant,\nalthough men\u2019s economic activity appears to have decreased as a result of the program, possibly\nthe result of increased leisure consumption allowed by their perception of their wives\u2019 increased\neconomic activity.\nThe differential impact measured between committee members and rank and file members\ncould be the result of the differential access to loans, with committee members\u2019 increased access\nallowing them to invest in different types of projects, perhaps with greater returns to scale. Or\nit could be the result of different unobservable characteristics (e.g., entrepreneurship) that can\n19", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nbe harnessed or realized only by access to credit. However, the fact that access to village bank\nloans appears to also encourage additional borrowing from other institutional sources is consistent\nwith the first possibility, namely that committee members are investing in different types of projects,\nperhaps with larger fixed assets, which require larger capital. Differential access to loans does\nmatter.\nThere are several policy implications of these research findings. First, these and perhaps\nother programs should seriously consider imposing (and enforcing) membership eligibility criteria\nsimilar to that used by the Grameen Bank (e.g., maximum allowable land holdings or other measures\nof wealth) in order to more actively target the poor. Beyond this type of restriction, however, villagers\nshould still self-select for membership since evidence presented here indicates that local information\nabout each household\u2019s creditworthiness is used to screen members. NGOs should also enforce\nthe rule that village banks are to select new committee members annually so that committee\nmembers do not become entrenched in their positions,28 which only encourages abuses. In the\ntwo villages where some committee turnover was observed, the use of multiple names was greatly\ndiminished, and borrowing was much more equitable between committee and rank and file members.\nClearer and more frequent public pronouncements of the village bank\u2019s goals and target group\nby the NGO fieldworkers, as well as stricter enforcement of existing rules against the use of multiple\nnames, would go a long way toward reaching the target group of the poor. One goal of village\nbanks is to \u201cempower\u201d the poor, especially poor women. But it is naive to think that existing village\npower structures will not pursue their own self-interest and use the village bank to enhance their\nown power if given the opportunity. It is equally naive to think that the relatively poor and powerless\ncan be empowered without more active involvement of program administrators to ensure that\nthey are the beneficiaries of these poverty lending programs. Along these lines, village bank rules\nregarding eligibility, limits on borrowing, and election of committee members could be printed\non each member\u2019s passbook, or posted in the village,29 thus helping to eliminate some of the\ninformation asymmetries that currently exist within the village regarding what is and is not\nacceptable within the village bank. Informal interviews indicated that the lack of such commonly\nrecognized rules restricts efforts of the poor to gain access to the program and restricts efforts\nby the rank and file to equalize their access to loans.\nCaution should be exercised before extrapolating these results to other contexts. Thailand\nis a relatively wealthy developing country, and many villagers already have access to low-interest\ncredit from financial institutions such as the BAAC. The average wealth of survey households\nwas over 500,000 baht, and average household low-interest debt, excluding village bank debt, was\nover 30,000 baht. In this context, loans of 1500 to 7500 baht may have a limited impact. Many\nwomen surveyed stated that the size of village bank loans was too small, and some women left\n28 At least in Thailand, literacy is not an issue in choosing committee members: approximately 80 percent of\nthe women surveyed reported being able to read and write.\n29 All surveyed villages had a village meeting place where other information on rice banks, buffalo banks, or\ngeneral village information was posted or could be posted.\n20", "Section VII\nSummary and Policy Conclusions\nthe program for that reason. It may not be surprising, then, that the largest impact was seen\non committee members, who were able to circumvent the loan ceilings. In fact, given the\ninappropriately small loan size, it is understandable that the influential villagers would manipulate\nthe system to obtain larger loans. It is arguable that this sort of manipulation would be reduced\nif program loan sizes increased.\nFurther research should be conducted on microfinance programs in other parts of the world\nto determine if these results are unique to Northeast Thailand or are typical of microfinance\nprograms in general. The research methods and survey design used here could be easily\nimplemented elsewhere. Since most microfinance programs regularly expand to new villages, which\ncould be used as controls, this type of survey could be widely undertaken.\n21", "ERD Working Paper No. 9\nMICROFINANCE IN NORTHEAST THAILAND: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW MUCH?\nAPPENDIX\nAppendix Table 1: List of Variables\nVariables Weighted Mean Standard Deviation\n(n=445)\nIndependent Variables\nMonths as village bank rank and file member 35.9 21.2\nMonths as village bank committee member 4.2 12.6\nMale-owned land value 5 years ago (baht) 169,763 340,890\nFemale-owned land value 5 years ago (baht) 217,333 628,873\nSex of household head (F=1) .2 .4\nEducation of male (years) 5.2 3.3\nEducation of female (years) 4.8 2.6\nFamily generations in village 3.4 1.1\nNumber of relatives in village 8.0 6.8\nVillage chief or assistant?
