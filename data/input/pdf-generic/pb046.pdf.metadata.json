The author thanks Ifzal Ali and Rana\nHasan for comments and discussion, and Sining Cuevas for\nresearch assistance.", "This policy brief discusses evidence for policy making within\nthe context of attaining the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of\nuniversal primary enrollment. Despite recent progress, many\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) will not attain this goal by 2015.\nUnsurprisingly, some of the biggest enrollment deficiencies within\ncountries occur at the bottom end of the income distribution. Empirical\nevidence indicates that children from poorer families are on average\nalmost three times more likely to be out of school versus those from\nricher families (UNESCO 2005). What this implies is that universal\nprimary enrollment cannot\u2014and will not\u2014be attained without an explicit\nfocus on inclusiveness. In addition, for many DMCs, there are serious\nconcerns regarding the quality of basic education.\nGiven this backdrop, the brief summarizes a simple analytical\nframework introduced in the theme chapter of the Key Indicators  (ADB\n2006). The framework can be used to address the following questions:\n(i) How can policymakers improve primary enrollment rates among\nthe poor? (ii) What methods are available to identify constraints to\nincreasing enrollment among the poor? (iii) What do we know about\nthe effectiveness of various corrective policies aimed at improving\nenrollment rates?\nThe applicability of the analytical framework is quite general,\nand it can be adapted to any particular sector or policy challenge.\nThe framework underscores the utility of using a combination of a\nmacro cross-country perspective with a micro evidence-based approach\nto devise, implement, and monitor policies; and given the emphasis\nnow among multilaterals on measurement and accountability for\noutcomes, this is consistent with the overall Management for\nDevelopment Results (MfDR) framework.\nIn terms of policy implications, the brief argues that a strategy\nfor improving enrollment rates among the poor will require several\ncomponents. First among these is a greater focus on measuring the\nextent to which there are enrollment inequalities, and how these are\ndistributed spatially within countries. Second, countries where\nenrollment inequalities are high may need to reevaluate their priorities\nand focus on allocating public expenditure so as to have more of a\ndirect benefit for the poor, e.g., by emphasizing primary over tertiary", "expenditure in public spending, and improved targeting of the latter.\nThird, corrective policy making needs to be grounded in empirical\nevidence on what some of the key binding constraints are and what\ninterventions would be the most effective in overcoming these. Finally,\npolicymakers must be held accountable to ensure that efforts to\nimprove outcomes among the poor do indeed occur.\nIdentifying Problems and Looking for Solutions:\nAn Analytical Framework\nBox 1 summarizes the key elements of the analytical framework.\nFirst, the framework underscores the need to look at relevant outcomes\nfrom a cross-country macro perspective; this is represented by the\nbox on the top left-hand side of the schematic. This basically entails\n\u201csituating\u201d the country among its comparators: is enrollment in a given\ncountry worse that that of other countries at similar income or public\neducation expenditure levels? Can we identify policy-relevant factors\nfrom such a cross-country perspective that could explain why primary\nenrollment inequality is lower in some countries versus others?1\nThe second component of the analytical framework, shown on\nthe top right-hand side of the schematic in Box 1, looks at evidence\nfor policy making from a within-country micro perspective. This would\nentail measuring the extent of enrollment inequality in the population\nas well as looking at spatial disaggregations to identify key regions\nthat may need special attention. This would also include looking at\nboth supply- and demand-related constraints to improving enrollment\nrates among the poor. From a supply perspective, since governments\ntend to be dominant in the provision of primary education in most\nDMCs, evaluations of policies might look at how pro-poor the\ncomposition of public education expenditure is: Are the poor benefiting\nfrom public spending? From a demand perspective, the focus would\nbe on identifying key determinants of primary enrollments.\n1 These \u201cvertical\u201d comparisons can potentially be important. Economic growth may\nlead to increases in returns to education and thereby cause a rise in demand for\nschooling and enrollment. variations across countries. However, variations across\ncountries having similar level of income, or across countries spending the same\namount on education, can suggest that there are other factors at play that may be\nimportant from a policy-making perspective.\n2", "Finally, another key methodological input into evidence-based\npolicy making is that of impact evaluation analysis, which focuses\nspecifically on issue of attribution of outcomes to policy interventions,\nand are usually carefully designed to ensure that causality can be\nrevealed.2 As depicted in the schematic in Box 1, impact evaluations\nare an important source of information for the design and\nimplementation of corrective policy interventions. For instance, if low\nhousehold income is a key constraint, would cash transfers boost\nenrollment rates? Are school meals effective in boosting enrollment\nrates for the poor? Would provision of free books be an effective\nstrategy?\nMeasurement for Management\nMeasurement for management is a key component of the\nanalytical framework elaborated above. We argue that a focus on\ninclusiveness requires measurement not only of national averages\nand gender decompositions but also of what the enrollment rates are\namong the $1-a-day and $2-a-day poor, for example. Increased\nknowledge, awareness, and dissemination of such disaggregated\nmeasures could itself catalyze the implementation of corrective policy\nactions, an insight gleaned from the application of social accountability\ntools such as \u201ccitizen report cards\u201d (these being surveys of citizen\nexperiences with government providers of social and other services;\nthe findings are disseminated widely with an eye at informing and\nstimulating improvements) (World Bank 2004b). In addition, spatial\ndisaggregation of indicators can also be extremely informative from a\ntargeting perspective.\nFigure 1 shows an example of disaggregated primary enrollment/\nattendance rates among those in the bottom versus the top economic\nquintile as estimated from household survey data from selected DMCs.\nAs can be seen, there are significant disparities with regard to\ninequalities in primary enrollment, even among countries that do not\ndiffer significantly in their levels of income and public education\n2 Some of the demand studies elaborated in the previous subsection can also\nreveal information as to the effectiveness of specific policy interventions and can\nqualify as impact evaluations as long as all other determinants  of enrollment outcomes\nhave been controlled for.\n3", "Box 1.

The former are estimated from\nsurvey data that often collect information on attendance rather than on enrollment.\n5", "Supply-side Determinants\nof Primary Enrollment Inequalities\nDifferences in enrollment outcomes can be related to the extent\nto which governments are pro-poor or due to some other localized\nfactors. For example, as Figure 2 shows, several of the DMCs that\nhave the biggest problems with enrollment inequalities (e.g., Cambodia,\nIndia, Lao PDR, and Nepal) are also those which emphasize tertiary\nover primary education in their public spending.\nDoes this imply that resources should be moved away from\ntertiary to primary schooling? Not necessarily so, at least as long as\nthe budgetary situation can allow for more spending on primary\neducation without reducing expenditure on tertiary education. But it\ndoes suggest that this lack of a pro-poor focus of the government\nmay itself be a binding constraint and this may be a very difficult\nissue to address. Empirical evidence suggests that lower income\ninequality and lower ethno-linguistic fractionalization in the population\ncould be key factors in explaining pro-poor government orientations\n(Addison and Rahman 2001). Income inequalities are, more often than\nFigure 2.

One\nimplication from this would be that making education policies more\npro-poor would require institutional reforms aimed at keeping the\ninfluence of elites in check.\nA related issue is whether or not allocated primary education\nexpenditures are actually reaching the poor. This can be revealed\nusing benefit-incidence analysis, which connects outlays with users\nto estimate the extent to which expenditures are pro-poor, i.e., if the\nshare of expenditure received by the poor is greater than their share\nin the population. Results of benefit\u2013incidence analyses across several\nDMCs indicate the pro-poor inclinations of public expenditure in\ncountries that have low enrollment inequalities such as Indonesia, Sri\nLanka, and Viet Nam. However, some high-inequality DMCs such as\nPakistan, Cambodia, and Bangladesh also had pro-poor primary\neducation allocations, suggesting that there may be other factors at\nplay (e.g., not enough spending, household demand determinants,\nquality issues) that are influencing enrollment outcomes.\nProvider surveys such as those assessing the quality of schools\nand teaching can also be informative in assessing the (in)effectiveness\nof public provision. In a recent study across six countries, Chaudhury\net al. (2006) found very high teacher absenteeism levels in public\nprimary schools: 16% in Bangladesh, 25% in India, and 19% in\nIndonesia. Teacher absenteeism was generally higher in poorer regions,\nbut lower in regions where parental literacy rates were high.\nDemand-side Determinants of Primary Enrollment\nFrom the demand side, measurement of effectiveness of policies\ntypically focuses on deriving valuations of schooling choices using\nmicro-level household data. Evidence from such analyses indicates\nthat the decision to enroll children in schools cannot be taken for\ngranted. The effectiveness of public policies aimed at improving\nenrollment rates is often a direct result of the extent to which such\npolicies affect the costs and benefits of schooling from a household\u2019s\nperspective, and this is particularly true for the poor.\nFrom the perspective of schooling characteristics, studies from\nlow-income countries show that a bricks-and-mortar approach based\nsimply on building more schools does not always have a significant\nimpact on enrollment rates. In fact, where average enrollment rates\nare low, such strategies may even have the perverse effect of increasing\nenrollment inequality if richer households capture the benefits of\nimproved access (Filmer 2004). This is not to say that building schools\nis the wrong policy choice: what this implies is that, in addition to\n7", "building schools as required, there may need to be special provisions\nto ensure that the poor do not get left behind.\nThere are many other examples of country-specific demand\nanalyses focusing on the issue of primary enrollment. Several micro-\nstudies indicate that household characteristics such as parental\neducation and income are usually far more important than access to\nschooling as determinants of primary school enrollment. Maternal\neducation, in particular, tends to have a strong positive impact on the\nenrollment of girls, indicating the need to focus on adult literacy\nprograms and social marketing campaigns aimed at improving\nknowledge and awareness of the benefits of education. For instance,\nevidence from Pakistan indicates that the presence of a school in the\nlocality did not influence enrollment decisions once parental income\nand education were controlled for (Burney and Irfan 1995). A similar\nfinding is reported by Deolalikar (2005b). He finds that improvements\nin schooling quality, proxied by the pupil\u2013teacher ratio at the primary\nlevel, as opposed to improvements in access had more of a positive\neffect on school attendance in Pakistan. Child labor is also an issue\nwith regard to schooling decisions, and Hazarika and Bedi (2003) find\nthat in Pakistan lowering the costs to primary schooling did decrease\nthe incidence of child labor, and increased enrollment. However, this\nheld true only for extra-household labor. For children engaged in intra-\nhousehold work, there was no effect of changes in the cost of primary\neducation on enrollment. Other schooling characteristics such as the\nprovision of mid-day meals were found to be important for boosting\nenrollment rates for girls in rural India (Dreze and Kingdon 2001).\n Ethnicity and caste are also often an issue: evidence from India\nsuggests that children from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes\nwere less likely to be enrolled in primary schools even after controlling\nfor parental education and income as well as schooling characteristics\n(Dreze and Kingdon 2001). This suggests a need for targeting based\nnot only on income but also on other characteristics that might reflect\na disadvantaged status.\nWhat do we know about the effectiveness of corrective policies\naimed at removing the binding constraints to improving enrollment\nrates for the poor? Evidence from impact evaluations suggests that\ncarefully targeted, pro-poor, results-focused interventions such as\nconditional cash transfers, mid-day meal programs, school health\ninterventions, and scholarships for girls have been highly effective in\nimproving education outcomes among the poor. Examples of such\ninterventions include the food-for-education program in Bangladesh\nwhere food transfers are made to poor households as long as the\n8", "children remain enrolled in primary school. Stipends and scholarships\nfor girls have also been found to be effective in improving enrollments\nin Bangladesh and Cambodia. The provision of subsidized private\nschools for poor girls in Balochistan, Pakistan was effective in\nimproving primary enrollment rates in urban areas (Alderman et al.\n2003). With regard to improved service provision, simple monitoring\nmechanisms (e.g., the use of tamper-proof digital cameras to record\nthe dates and times of teacher presence) combined with performance-\nbased incentives were found to be highly effective in improving schooling\noutcomes in India (Banerjee and Duflo 2006).\nConclusions\nAttaining the MDG of universal primary enrollment by 2015 will\nrequire a focus on inclusiveness as the biggest shortfalls in enrollment\nrates within countries exist at the bottom end of the income distribution.\nIn order to address this challenge, this brief introduced a simple\ndiagnostic framework that combines a macro situational analysis with\na more informative micro-based approach to generating and utilizing\nevidence for policy making. Demand and other micro-based analyses\ncan reveal what some of the constraints to improving enrollment might\nbe. Impact evaluations can help inform the choice of effective policies\ndesigned to overcome some of these constraints to low enrollment.\nOne key point that we make is the importance of disaggregated\nmeasurement. Increased knowledge, awareness, and dissemination\nof what the enrollment rates are among the poor\u2014and the contrast\nwith comparator countries\u2014can itself be a catalyst for corrective policy\naction. In addition, public expenditure compositions can often reveal\nwhether or not the poor are benefiting from public spending. In some\ncountries, though, high inequalities can exist despite expenditures\non primarily schooling appearing to be pro-poor. Hence, it is important\nto look at both inequalities in outcomes as well as inequalities in\npublic expenditure allocations.\nEvidence from impact evaluation studies underscore the\nimportance of carefully targeted pro-poor interventions aimed at\nimproving enrollment rates among those that need it most. Costs and\nbenefits of schooling are key factors influencing enrollment decisions\nfor poorer households, and interventions that directly reduce costs or\nenhance the benefits from schooling appear to be the most effective.\nIn this regard, conditional cash transfer, food for education, and\ntargeted scholarships, in addition to the standard bricks-and-mortar\nfocus on improving social infrastructure, can be highly effective in\n9", "raising enrollment rates among the poor. Furthermore, parental (and\nespecially maternal) education is another key determinant suggesting\nthat adult literacy may also need to be considered as a means of\nimproving primary enrollment rates among the poor.\nReferences\nAsian Development Bank.
