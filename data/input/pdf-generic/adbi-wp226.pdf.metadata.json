INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nDemand for infrastructure development in Asia far exceeds the available funding. Regional \ndevelopment  institutions  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  extend  funds  to \nsupport  many  cross-border  (also  termed  subregional  or  multi-country)  projects  to  promote \nsocioeconomic development in participating countries. \n\nAt  the  policy  level,  there  are  two  major  economic  justifications  for  regional  cooperation \nbetween  two  or  more  countries:  (i)  the  need  to  deal  with  project-related  additionalities  and \npositive  and  negative  externalities  and  (ii)  the  potential  to  derive  economies  of  scale  in \npursuit of national goals. By pursuing these, all participating countries benefit from regional \ncooperation. However, removing physical and nonphysical barriers in order to realize these \nbenefits requires investment as well as harmonization and simplification of relevant policies \nand procedures. \n\nRegarding  the  first  justification  for  regional  cooperation,  cross-border  projects  may  bring \nadditional  concessional  and  non-concessional  funds.  Positive  externalities  (e.g.,  benefits \nsuch as time and cost savings, environmental protection, and trade facilitation) and negative \nexternalities  (e.g.,  costs  such  as  environmental  pollution,  trafficking,  and  the  spread  of \ncommunicable  diseases)  arise  when  the  consequences  of  one  or  more  countries\u2019  actions \nthe  concerned  countries  do  not  make  cooperative \nspill  over  national  borders. \narrangements, too few positive externalities and too many negative ones will arise. \n\nIf \n\nAs  to  the  second  justification,  regional  programs  and  cross-border  projects  can  produce \neconomies of scale in provision of public or private (marketable) goods and services above \nand  beyond  what  any  country  could  achieve  alone.  As  such,  regional  cooperation  can \nfacilitate the achievement of national goals. \n\nRegional  economic  cooperation  can  also  be  conceptualized  through  club  theory.  Any \ncollective endeavor (or club) must satisfy two basic conditions: (i) it must be self-sustaining \nand (ii) it must provide enough net benefits for each of its members. The success of a club \ndepends on its benefits derived from reduction in unit cost from pooled productive capacities \nexceeding  the  cost  of  collective  action.  The  cost  is  often  influenced  by  physical  distance \nbetween  the  countries.  In  the  Pacific,  for  example,  adding  more  remote  countries  entails \nhigher diseconomies of isolation. This tension between scale benefits and distance costs of \ncollective action determines the size of an \u201coptimal club\u201d (in this case, a group of countries). \nThe composition of the \u201coptimal club\u201d may vary significantly according to the issue or service \nunder consideration. \n\nReduction  in  trade  costs  is  among  the  most  important  expected  outcomes  of  cross-border \ninfrastructure  projects.  Trade  costs  are  often  defined  as  the  range  of  costs  involved  in \nmoving  a  product  from  a  point  of  production  to  a  market.  As  such,  they  can  refer  to  both \nnational  and  cross-border  transactions.  For  an  analysis  of  regional  cooperation,  the  focus \nmust  be  on  the  cross-border  aspects  of  such  costs  (or  \u201cinternational  trade  costs\u201d),  since \nthese raise barriers to trade and restrict the return on investments in export goods (although \nthey  raise  it  for  import  substitutes).  Declines  in  such  costs  make  goods  more  cost \ncompetitive and raise the return on investment. \n\nWhile the benefits associated with cross-border infrastructure projects and the rationale for \nregional  cooperation  are  well  recognized  by  policymakers  and  practitioners,  evaluation \npractice suffers from analytical difficulties as well as inadequate data because of the elusive \nnature of such data for infrastructure projects whose benefits and costs go beyond national \nboundaries. This paper attempts to fill this gap. \n\nSection  2  defines  cross-border  infrastructure  projects  and  provides  the  framework  and \ncriteria  for  evaluating  them.  Section  3  examines  the  extent  to  which  such  criteria  can  be \napplied in evaluating recent cross-border infrastructure projects. It also describes emerging \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nimpact  patterns  observed  in  various  relevant  studies.  Section  4  draws  out  lessons  learned \nand  Section  5  provides  recommendations  for  design  and  implementation  of  cross-border \ninfrastructure projects. \n\n2.  EVALUATION FRAMEWORK \n\n2.1  Concept and Definition \n\nFor  the  purpose  of  the  study  on  Infrastructure  and  Regional  Cooperation,  a  \u201ccross-border\u201d \ninfrastructure project is defined to be either an infrastructure project with activities spanning \ntwo  or  more  countries,  or  a  national  infrastructure  project  that  has  significant  cross-border \nimpact. Examples of national projects with significant cross-border impacts include transport \ninfrastructure  (land,  sea,  and  air)  projects  that  create  international  traffic,  power  projects \ninvolving  sales  of  electricity  to  neighbor  countries,  and  cross-border  telecommunications \nnetworks.1\n \n\nIn the context of ADB, its Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy (ADB 2006a) does \nnot explicitly define \u201ccross-border infrastructure,\u201d but it articulates its distinguishing feature as \ncross-border externalities that would not be caused by a collection of national projects. The \nstrategy also requires that such infrastructure create \u201cadditional\u201d net benefits that constitute \nsome  form  of  positive  spillover  effects  accruing  to  all  participating  countries  (i.e.,  regional \npublic goods). That is, the net benefits of cross-border projects would be larger than those \n2 The  current  practice  of  project  benefit-\nthat  would  be  obtained  by  national  projects  alone.\ncost analysis is typically limited to quantifying direct impact in the nature of partial equilibrium. \nThe  analysis  of  cross-border  projects  needs  to  cover  broader  and  indirect  impacts  in  the \nnature of dynamic general equilibrium to the extent reasonable.3\n \n\nThe larger are these cross-border positive externalities, the stronger is the case for regional \npublic goods, and therefore, the stronger is the economic rationale for regional cooperation. \nAnother rationale for regional  cooperation  derives from coordination failure  among  national \ngovernments. National governments may not be willing to contribute their share of costs of \nproviding  regional  public goods. This may  be  because they  think that the  partner  countries \nmight  not  match  their  contribution.  Such  a  failure  to  contribute  would  not  necessarily  be \nstrategic  (because  neighbor  countries  are  aware  that  they  will  interact  again  in  the  future), \nbut  could  be  due  to  a  combination  of  resource  constraints  and  institutional  weakness.  The \nlarger  is  the  extent  of  such  coordination  failure,  the  stronger  is  the  economic  rationale  for \n4\npublic intervention (see Appendix 1 for a discussion on regional public goods).\n The rule of \n\n                                                \n1 ADB operations refer to \u201csubregional\u201d instead of \u201ccross-border\u201d projects. The World Bank defines a subregional \nproject  more  restrictively  as  having  more  than  two  countries  involved  directly  in  the  project;  a  two-country \nproject is defined as a bilateral cross-border project. The latter case can be considered as having subregional \nimpacts  on  the  condition  that  bilateral  borders  are  part  of  economic  corridors.  The  working  definition  of  a \n\u201csubregional\u201d  project  at  ADB  accommodates  any  projects  that  can  be  described  by  one  or  more  of  the \nfollowing:  (i)  involving  two  or  more  countries  but  excluding  bilateral  projects;  (ii)  single  country  project  but \nlinking  subregional  transport  corridors;  and  (iii)  those  included  in  Regional  Cooperation  Strategies  and \nPrograms. \n\n2 A clear case of divergence between aggregate net benefits and the sum of national net benefits is evidenced by \nan  example  in  Roy  (2000)  of  the  high-speed  Paris\u2013Brussels\u2013Cologne\u2013Amsterdam\u2013London  rail  project.  He \npoints out that conventional evaluation from the national perspective omitted cross-border benefits accruing to \nnon-resident users traveling in each national section and led to underestimation of aggregate net benefits by \n27%. \n\n3 This issue is not unique to cross-border projects. However, the larger scale of cross-border projects requires, \nfor  example,  the  addition  of  various  corridor  investments  in  infrastructure  facilities  to  road  investments,  and \ncorrespondingly the inclusion of benefits from these investments in the overall analysis.  \n\n4 In this regard, donors that support regional cooperation are justified in earmarking some portion of their financial \nresources  for  cross-border  projects.  ADB  has  a  \u201cset-aside\u201d  portion  of  about  10%  in  its  concessional  funds \n(called the Asian Development Fund). \n\n \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nthe game in regional cooperation is that all participating countries benefit (a win-win result for \nthe club). \n\n2.2  Project Cycle and Evaluation \n\nIn general, project evaluation requires that a consistent framework is applied at all stages of \nthe project cycle. The process starts with analytical work that identifies potential investment \nprojects.  Then  a  country-level  or  sector-level  program  selects  the  projects  to  be  financed. \nThen  each  project  is  formulated  by  financiers  including  external  donors  and  executing \nagencies  of  the  client  country.  After  approval  by  all  stakeholders,  the  project  agreement  is \nsigned and its implementation commenced. A project performance report is prepared by the \nproject  officers  as  part  of the monitoring  of the project\u2019s  implementation. After  the  project\u2019s \nplanned  activities  are  completed,  the  project  officers  produce  a  project  completion  report. \nThis provides  an  opportunity for  self-evaluation  of the  process  of  implementation,  identifies \nsuccess  factors  and  problems  encountered,  checks  all  the  assumptions  made  at  the \nappraisal  stage,  recalculates  financial  and  economic  rates  of  return,  and  reports  on \ncompliance with social and environment safeguards. It also identifies lessons and follow-up \nactions,  where  appropriate,  to  ensure  that  project  benefit  streams  continue.  Further \nmonitoring and progress reporting is carried out by executing agencies of the client country. \nAfter a few years, the project is post-evaluated. This involves rating project performance in \nrelation  to  contribution  to  development  impact  using  a  set  of  criteria  such  as  relevance, \neffectiveness, efficiency, and likely sustainability of the project outputs and outcomes. \n\n2.3  Project Design and Monitoring Framework \n\nAt  the  project  design  stage,  some  logically  consistent  framework  is  required  that  can  be \ncarried through to the later stages of project cycle. Such a framework provides causal links \nbetween  inputs  or  activities  and  outputs,  and  between  outputs  and  outcomes  (short-  and \nmedium-term  outcomes  and  long-term  impact).  The  framework  also  provides  a  basis  for \nproject monitoring and evaluation at the implementation and operation stages. For example, \nbenefits to be monitored associated with cross-border project benefits can be related to the \nfollowing categories of gains: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMarket gains such as domestic market extension and economies of scale (e.g., \npower), connectivity and access to markets (e.g., transport); \n\nEfficiency  gains  (cost  saving)  such  as reduction in  time  and  vehicle  operating \ncosts,  reduction  in  physical  barriers  to  trade  (e.g.,  better  roads,  railways); \nreduction in non-physical barriers to trade (e.g., reduced transaction costs due \nto trade facilitation, harmonized customs, and border formalities); and \n\nWelfare gains such as contribution to trade creation, benefits to all participating \ncountries  and  subregional  community,  and  increased  regional  and  global \nintegration. \n\n2.4  Ex Ante Evaluation \n\nProjects are pre-evaluated looking at project rationale and strategic links, alternatives, costs \nand  benefits,  and  risks  and  uncertainties.  For  example,  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  project \nappraisal  (ADB  1997)  provide  project  appraisal  concepts  and  step-by-step  methods.  In \naddition,  there  are  sector-level  handbooks  for  project  economic  analysis  and  also  a \nmethodology note and handbook for economic analysis of subregional projects. \n\nWhile economic analysis of national projects is concerned primarily with whether the overall \nnet economic benefits are positive and generally helping the poor, the economic analysis of \ncross-border  projects  goes  a  step  further  to  analyze  how  their  benefits  and  costs  are \n\n \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\ndistributed  across  participating  countries.  As  multiple  governments  must  agree  on  and \ncoordinate the institutional and financing arrangements of cross-border projects to ensure all \nstakeholders  can  anticipate  net  gains  from  the  project  in  question,  analysis  of  benefit-cost \ndistribution  helps  to  alleviate  coordination  failure  and  ensure  project  sustainability.  In \nparticular,  it  is  important  to  identify  possible  net  losers  and  build  in  necessary  adjustments \nfor  socioeconomic  and  environmental  externalities.  Most  obviously,  for  example,  such \nadjustments  can  include  compensatory  arrangements  for  relocated  residents  and  for \nparticipating governments to ensure operation and maintenance and to address unintended \nnegative impacts.  \n\nIn  principle,  project  analysis,  whether  national  or  cross-border,  should  care  about \nexternalities  and  distributional  aspects  in  order  to  better  inform  decision  makers  and \nstakeholders.  ADB\u2019s guidelines  (ADB  1997)  dedicate  one  appendix  to  distribution  analysis. \nAdhikari and Weiss (1999a, 2004) extended this framework to cross-border aspects with the \nstakeholder breakdown  between  participating  countries. Therefore,  a  basic  methodology of \ndistribution analysis for cross-border projects has been put forward (see Box 1). \n\nBox 1: Key Steps in Economic Analysis of Cross-Border Projects \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nIdentify  the  market  (demand)  both  within  and  outside  the  country  and \nsubregion; \n\nEstablish the project\u2019s financing plan and identify any project-specific additional \nand concessional funds; \n\nFor  commercial  projects,  estimate  the  financial  net  present  value  (NPV)  (at  a \n10% or 12% discount rate) and internal rate of return (IRR) at constant United \nStates  dollars  and  show  how  the  income  of  different  groups  and  countries  is \naffected; \n\nEstimate  the  benefit  of  project-specific  finance  as  the  difference  between  the \npresent value of the inflow of funds and the present value of the outflow under \nthe terms specified; \n\nFor  non-commercial  projects  and  for  commercial  projects  with  significant  side \neffects, quantify and value the external effects (e.g., environmental impacts and \ncost saving/consumer surplus); \n\nAllow  for  any  important  market  distortions  by  applying  national  conversion \nfactors  to  adjust  financial  values  relating  to  expenditure  in  a  country  to \neconomic prices; \n\nWhere a financial analysis has been carried out, adjust the financial NPV and \nIRR to obtain the corresponding economic NPV and IRR; \n\nFor  non-commercial  projects,  compare  economic  benefits  (externalities) \ndirectly with economic costs to obtain the economic NPV and IRR; \n\nAllocate  the  economic  NPV  between  participating  countries  and  show  the \nlosers\u2014and  consider  whether  any  compensating \ngainers  and  any \narrangements  are  required  to  offset  loss  to  any  of  the  participating  countries; \nand \n\n(x) \n\nUndertake risk and sensitivity analysis. \n\n Source: Adhikari and Weiss (1999b). \n\nAs  discussed  above,  a  successful  cross-border  project  should  offer  benefits  for  all \nparticipating  countries.  To  determine  this,  analysts  and  evaluators  need  to  look  at  project \noutcomes  and  impacts,  i.e.,  short-  and  long-term  benefits,  and  their  distribution  at  local, \nnational,  cross-border,  subregional  and  regional  (extra-subregional)  levels.  Complementary \ninvestments  can  create  additional  demand  and  increase  project  benefits.  For  example, \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\neconomic  corridors  complement  transport  corridors  and  also  mitigate  costs  (e.g.,  to \nenvironment  and  public  health).  Benefits  arise  from  cost  savings,  time  savings,  efficiency \ngains because of the larger scale of operations, and welfare gains because the subregional \nsociety as a whole benefits. However, estimation needs to be carried out carefully to avoid \ndouble counting of such benefits as vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings and time savings \nvis-\u00e0-vis growth in transport sector activities, better quality roads vis-\u00e0-vis road safety (time \nsavings  of  passengers  and  cargo,  savings  of  lives  and  injuries),  and  additional  economic \nactivities vis-\u00e0-vis better access to market (not included in the cost savings). \n\nEqually  important  is  to  identify  risks  to  sustainability  of  outcomes  and  impacts.  Important \nconsiderations  for  this  risk  identification  include  operation  and  maintenance  by  transit \ncountries or locations and revenue generation or special funding for that purpose. Common \nproject  risks  and  sustainability  factors  relate  to  financial  returns  and  revenue  generation  of \nthe project, sharing of costs among participating countries, technical upkeep (operation and \nmaintenance), foreign exchange risk (e.g., in cases of power purchase), and complementary \ninvestments.  \n\n2.5  Post-Completion Evaluation \n\nUpon its completion, the project\u2019s performance is evaluated based on relevance, \neffectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. Relevance refers to the adequacy of the design \nand the consistency of the project\u2019s impact and outcome with the government\u2019s and donor\u2019s \ndevelopment strategies at the time of approval. Effectiveness refers to the extent to which \nthe project outcome as designed and approved has been achieved. Efficiency refers to how \neconomically resources have been converted to results, typically expressed as the \neconomic internal rate of return or cost-effectiveness indicators. Sustainability refers to the \nlikelihood that human, institutional, financial, and other resources are sufficient to maintain \nthe project outcome over its economic life. \n\n2.6 \n\nImpact Evaluation \n\nImpact  evaluation  involves  systematic  identification  of  a  given  development  activity\u2019s \neffects\u2014positive or negative, intended or not\u2014on individual households, institutions, and the \nenvironment.  It  helps  us  to  better  understand  the  extent  to  which  activities  reach  the  poor \nand the magnitude of their effects on people\u2019s welfare. Tools for impact evaluations can be \nlarge-scale  sample  surveys  in  which  project  populations  and  control  groups  are  compared \nbefore  and  after  the  intervention  and  possibly  at  several  points  during  it.  Evaluations  can \nalso  be  done  through  small-scale  rapid  assessment  and  participatory  appraisals  where \nestimates  of  impact  are  obtained  from  combining  group  interviews,  key  informants,  case \nstudies, and available secondary data. \n\nThere  are  two  basic  approaches  to  impact  evaluation:  non-experimental  and  random \nexperimental.  The  non-experimental  approach  uses  statistical  techniques  to  construct  the \ncounterfactual  outcome.  These  techniques,  though  frequently  used,  are  often  subject  to \nbiased  results  that  may  lead  to  incorrect  development  impacts.  Random  experimental \nmethods  are  common  in  the  pharmaceutical  and  other  industries  but  are  new  to  the \neconomic  development  field.  In  the  medical  field,  random  assignment  to  treatment  and \ncontrol  groups  (also  called  a  \u201crandomized  control  trial\u201d)  is  implemented  depending  on  the \nnature of the medical intervention, who the beneficiaries are, or what the benefits are. Thus, \nas in the medical field, the unit of randomization in the economic development field could be \nindividuals, groups (e.g., schools, primary health care centers), or geographical areas (e.g., \nvillages,  cities).  The  random  selection  of  the  treatment  (under  the  project)  and  control \n(outside the project) groups ensures that in general, these groups are identical at the outset. \nAny  difference  in  the  socioeconomic  or  environmental  outcomes  between  the  two  groups \nafter the project is taken to be attributable to the project. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nRandom  experimental  assignment  is  considered  to  be  the  most  reliable  approach  to \nmeasuring net impact of development assistance. As Duflo, Glennerster and Kremer (2008) \nhave  pointed  out,  only  properly  implemented  randomization  can  solve  selection  bias \ncompletely. For example, the PROGRESA program (now called Oportunidades) in Mexico is \none  of  the  best  known  examples  of  a  randomized  evaluation  in  developing  countries.  The \nprogram  was  launched  in  1998  with  a  deliberate  built-in  evaluation  design  in  which  half  of \nthe  households  in  target  communities  were  selected  to  receive  the  program,  and  baseline \nand  subsequent  data  were  collected  for  both  treatment  and  control  communities.  Actual \nevaluation of the program was contracted to International Food Policy Research Institute and \nthe  data  was  shared  via  their  website. The  evaluation  had  a  demonstration  effect  and  was \nreplicated in many other Latin American countries.  \n\nThe  nature  of  randomization  requires  that  the  treatment  groups  (areas)  as  opposed  to \ncontrol groups (areas) be fairly disaggregated, such as at the level of individuals, villages, or \nat most districts. Randomized experiments are therefore more suitable for \u201ctargeted\u201d projects \nsuch as education and health programs than infrastructure projects because the \u201ctreatment\u201d \n(or influence) of the latter is by nature diffused geographically. Furthermore, while the main \npurpose  of  targeted  interventions  is  to  deliver  direct  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries, \nmuch  of  the  benefits  of  cross-border  infrastructure  projects  are  indirect  and  diffused  with \nvarying influence over beneficiary groups, making it difficult to design randomization even at \nthe  project  design  stage.  Nonetheless,  a  carefully  carried  out  impact  evaluation  can  be \nuseful  in many  important  ways.  Box  2  summarizes the  scope  of usefulness,  as  well  as the \nstrengths and drawbacks, of rigorous impact evaluation. \n\nBox 2: Rigorous Impact Evaluation of Cross-Border Infrastructure Projects \n\nScope of usefulness:  \n\n\u2022  Measuring  outcomes  and  impacts  of  an  activity  and  distinguishing  these  from \n\nthe influence of other, external factors. \n\n\u2022  Helping to clarify whether costs for an activity are justified. \n\n\u2022 \n\nInforming  decisions  on  whether  to  expand,  modify,  or  eliminate  projects, \nprograms, or policies. \n\n\u2022  Drawing lessons for improving the design and management of future activities. \n\n\u2022  Comparing the effectiveness of alternative interventions. \n\n\u2022  Strengthening accountability for results. \n\n\u2022  Strengths:  \n\n\u2022  Provides  estimates  of  the  magnitude  of  outcomes  and  impacts  for  different \n\ndemographic groups or regions over time. \n\n\u2022  Provides answers to some of the most central development questions: To what \nextent  are  we  making  a  difference?

Most  likely,  the  best  option  is  to  apply  a  quasi  difference-in-difference \napproach by comparing \u201cbefore\u201d (baseline) and \u201cafter\u201d (post completion) situations between \nthe  areas  (people)  under  project  influence  (e.g.,  along  the  designated  economic  corridor) \nand those located relatively farther away from project influence.5\n \n\nEconomy-wide  general  equilibrium  modeling  such  as  the  use  of  computable  general \nequilibrium  (CGE)  models  has  the  advantage  of  capturing  indirect  effects  through  forward \nand backward linkages within and across economies given the rigorous economic structure \nbuilt  in  the  models.  However,  it  has  a  high  data  requirement  that  may  not  be  normally \navailable  at  disaggregated  levels  in  developing  countries.  Also,  CGE  analysis  tends  to  be \nsimulation  or  scenario  exercises  based  on  certain  assumptions  that  dictate  changes  in \nexogenous  or  policy  variables.  This  type  of  analysis  may  be  more  suitable  for  macro-  and \nsector-level analysis, which is left to other discussion papers in this research project. \n\n2.7  Evaluation Criteria \n\nWith  the  above  framework  in  mind,  we  can  develop  a  set  of  practical  evaluation  criteria \nspecific  to  cross-border  infrastructure  projects  applicable  at  various  stages  of  the  project \ninputs); \ncycle.  These  stages  are \n(ii) implementation  stage \nto  produce  outputs); \n(iii) implementation  completion  stage  (physical  outputs  and  initial  outcomes);  and  (iv) post-\ncompletion  stage  or  operation  (ultimate  desired  outcomes  and  impacts).  A  particular  focus \nshould  be  on  the  identification  of  cross-border  externalities\u2014both  positive  and  potentially \nnegative.

REVIEW OF CROSS-BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE \n\nPROJECTS \n\nThe review in this section draws on available documents from inside and outside ADB and \ninterviews  with  ADB  officers. The framework  and  criteria  suggested  in the  previous section \nare applied in the review to the extent possible. \n\nADB\u2019s  lending  to  explicitly  \u201csubregional\u201d  projects  came  on  full  stream  only  after  the  late \n1990s  beginning  with  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Program,  followed  by  other \nregional  cooperation  initiatives  such  as  Central  Asian  Regional  Cooperation  (CAREC)  and \nSouth  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC).  As  a  result,  a  limited  number  of \ncross-border  infrastructure  projects  have  been  completed  and  can  be  evaluated  ex  post. \nTherefore, our review covers both completed and ongoing projects. \n\nThe list of the 26 projects we reviewed is provided in Appendix 3. They were selected from \nthe  projects  either  completed  or  ongoing  in  the  transport,  energy,  and  information  and \ncommunications technology (ICT) sectors that are at least partially financed by ADB. Of the \nprojects,  10  have  been  completed  and  the  other  16  are  ongoing.  We  summarize  findings \nfrom  our  review  of  these  projects  along  several  key  aspects  below.  (The  numbers  in \nparentheses indicate serial numbers used in Appendix 3.) \n\n3.1  Quality at Entry \n\n3.1.1 \n\nInadequate Presentation of Rationale as a Cross-Border Project \n\nWith  a  few  exceptions  (e.g.,  Establishment  of  Pacific  Aviation  Safety  Office,  Number  26), \nproject appraisal documents generally fall short of articulating cross-border externalities and \nrationale  for  collective  action  in  a  multi-country  perspective.  While  the  rationale  from  the \nviewpoint  of  individual  countries  is  relatively  well  established,  presentation  on  the  rationale \nfor  regional  cooperation  and  coordination  is  often  weak.  Positive  cross-border  effects  to \nneighboring  countries  seem  to  be  given  secondary  importance.  This  would  be  unfortunate \nfor  projects  where  financing  requirements  are  large  and  an  explicitly  regional  perspective \ncould help in mobilizing funds from a wider circle of donors, particularly for transport projects \nfor  which  private  sector  funds  are  hard  to  mobilize.  For  example,  (i) the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao PDR)  section  of  the  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  in  GMS \nseems to be the \u201cweakest link\u201d as categorized by the supply characteristics of regional public \ngoods (see Appendix 1) and could have been articulated in the project document (Number \n5); (ii) the Cambodian section of the Southern Economic Corridor in GMS seems to be the \n\u201cweaker  link\u201d  (Number  6)  (also  see  Appendix  1);  (iii) the  Cambodian  section  of  the \nSingapore\u2013Kunming  railway  link  seems  to  be  the  \u201cweakest  link\u201d  (Number  7);  and  (iv) the \nViet Nam  section  of  the  Kunming\u2013Haiphong  railway  link  seems  to  be  the  \u201cweaker  link\u201d \n(Number 8). \n\nFor power projects that are designed to sell electricity from one country to another, the bulk \nof the benefits accruing to both countries can be considered cross-border benefits because \nthey  would  not  arise  if  the  power  generated  could  not  cross  the  border  and  exploit \neconomies  of  scale  in  a  regional  perspective.  For  a  selling  country,  cross-border  benefits \nderive from additional sales revenue for the operating entity and additional tax revenues for \nthe  government.  For  a  purchasing  country,  cross-border  benefits  derive  from  additional \nconsumer surplus by receiving lower-cost power compared with alternative energy sources. \nTheir  cross-border  \u201cnet\u201d  benefits  are  obtained  by  subtracting  the  construction  and \nmaintenance costs incurred by each country. \n\n \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\n3.1.2  National Orientation Taking Focus Away from Benefits Distribution \n\nOut  of  the  26  projects  reviewed,  13  included  some  form  of  distribution  analysis  across \ncountries and identification of cross-border benefits separate from national benefits while the \nothers  did  not  include  distribution  analysis  nor  separate  cross-border  benefits  in  their \neconomic  analysis  at  the  project  preparation  stage  (see  Box  3).  Of  the  former  group,  8 \nprojects  are  loans  provided  to  multiple  countries  while  12  projects  in  the  latter  group  are \nloans  provided  to  a  single  borrower  country. While  the  lack  of  distribution  analysis  may  be \npartly  due  to  data  and  resource  constraints,  it  may  also  be  due  to  political  or  strategic \nconsiderations  within  multilateral  donor  agencies  like  ADB  in  dealing  with  borrower \ngovernments.  An  incentive  to  carry  out  distribution  analysis  might  be  weak  when  an \nassistance  loan  is  extended  to  a  single  country.  However,  such  a  tendency  would  be \nunfortunate because showing additional cross-border benefits accruing to neighbor countries \nwould  enhance  further  cooperation  and  promote  better  alignment  of  national  and  regional \ndevelopment goals. Assessment of whether there are benefits for all participating countries \nis very important for the successful preparation of cross-border projects. \n\nBox 3: Inadequate Distribution Analysis \n\n\u2022  No  account  of  subregional  benefits  despite  the  project\u2019s  subregional  nature \n\n(Number 1). \n\n\u2022  No  attempt  was  made  for  distribution  analysis,  but  given  the  nature  of  the \nproject, identification of cross-border benefits and explicit distribution analysis \nwould have strengthened the project rationale (Number 3). \n\n\u2022 \n\nInitial  analysis  of  the  project  did  not  include  distribution  analysis  due  to  the \nperceived  sensitivity  of  the  inequitable  benefit  distribution  among  the  three \naffected countries (Number 5). \n\n\u2022  Subregional  benefits  associated  with  the  road\u2019s  contribution  to  increased \nintegration of the economies of Thailand, Cambodia, and Viet Nam along the \nSouthern  Economic  Corridor  were  discussed  but  not  quantified  due  to  the \n\u201clong-term\u201d nature of these benefits (Number 6). \n\n\u2022  Distributional  analysis  was  done  only  within  the  borrowing  country  even \nthough the project title includes \u201cGMS\u201d explicitly. The project was categorized \nas a \u201csingle-country, regional project\u201d as the road is located strictly within the \nLao PDR  but  it  connects  with  the  already  existing  road  on  the  Thai  side \n(Number 10). \n\n\u2022  Even when a power project is designed to sell electricity from one country to \nanother,  the  economic  analysis  often  lacks  benefit  distribution  across \ncountries (Numbers 12, 13). \n\n\u2022  When a poverty reduction objective is combined with a regional cooperation \nobjective,  analysis  of  benefit  distribution  across  countries  seems  to  be \nneglected or receives low priority (Numbers 6, 14). \n\n\u2022  While  the  project  involves  Cambodia\u2019s  power  purchase  from  Viet  Nam, \ncross-border  benefits  to  Viet  Nam  associated  with  economies  of  scale  and \nadditional sales were not quantified (Number 16). \n\n\u2022  While  all  net  benefits  accruing  to  participating  countries  can  be  considered \ncross-border  benefits  in  the  ICT  project,  the  project  document  kept  the \ndistribution  analysis  as  an  internal  document  due  to  concern  over  potential \npolitical sensitivity (Number 25). \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation. \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\n3.1.3  Additional Funding Specific to Cross-Border Nature \n\nMost  project  documents  do  not  explain  adequately  about  additional  funding  of  a \nconcessional nature that may have been provided specifically due to the cross-border nature \nof the project in question.6\n Some donors may have strategic as well as commercial interest \nin  supporting  certain  projects  (e.g.,  Malaysia\u2019s  support  to  the  railway  project  in  Cambodia) \nand others including bilateral donors may prefer to allocate a certain portion of their funds to \ncross-border  projects.  As  these  funds  are  considered  to  be  net  benefits  flowing  into  the \nparticipating countries as a whole in the form of net resource transfer, a clearer articulation \nof this aspect is warranted (see Box 4). \n\n(Number 10). \n\n(Number 14). \n\n(Number 17). \n\n(Number 20). \n\n(Number 21). \n\nBox 4: Project-Specific Concessional Finance for Cross-Border Projects \n\n\u2022  The  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project,  initially  presented  as  a  purely  domestic \nproject, was later presented as a subregional one. This may have helped in mobilizing \ncooperation  and  additional  funds  from  the  Thai  and  PRC  governments.  The  project \ndocument could have articulated this financing arrangement more clearly (Number 5). \n\n\u2022  Funding from OPEC may be specific to the project\u2019s regional nature (Numbers 6, 18). \n\n\u2022  Funding from OPEC and Malaysia may be specific to the regional nature (Number 7). \n\n\u2022  Funding from France may be specific to the regional nature (Number 8). \n\n\u2022  Funding  from  OPEC,  Australia,  and  Korea  may  be  specific  to  the  regional  nature \n\n\u2022  Funding from Australia may be specific to the regional nature (Number 11). \n\n\u2022  Funding from JBIC may be specific to the regional nature (Numbers 13, 16). \n\n\u2022  Funding  from  the  World  Bank  and  Norway  may  be  specific  the  regional  nature \n\n\u2022  Funding  from  EBRD  and  TRACECA  are  considered  specific  to  the  regional  nature \n\n\u2022  ADB grant and funding from Korea and the PRC may be specific to the regional nature \n\n\u2022  Funding  from  IsDB  and  Saudi  Arabia  may  be  specific  to  the  regional  nature \n\n\u2022  Grant  specific  to  regional  project  was  provided  by  USAID  in  the  amount  of  US$0.5 \nmillion.  In  addition,  funding  from  OPEC  and  EBRD  may  be  specific  to  the  regional \nnature (Number 23). \n\n\u2022  Funding from OFID and IsDB may be specific to the regional nature (Number 24). \n\n\u2022  Funds  from  New  Zealand,  ICAO,  and  APEC  were  due  to  the  regional  nature \n\n(Number 26). \n\nAPEC = Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation; EBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; \nICAO = International Civil Aviation Organization; IsDB = Islamic Development Bank; JBIC = Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation; OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development; OPEC = Organization for \nPetroleum Exporting Countries; TRACECA = Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation. \n\n \n\n                                                \n6 See the previous footnote.

Some external studies have reported cases in which adequate compensation \nwas  not  being  made.  For  example,  a  nongovernmental  organization  in  Cambodia  reported \nthat  during  the  implementation  of  the  Phnom  Penh\u2013Ho  Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC)  Highway \nProject,  there  was  no  compensation  on  land  or  inadequate  compensation  was  given  to \naffected families along the project road in Prey Veng Province (Thi 2008). The improvement \nof  National  Roads 5 and 6,  part  of  which  was  under  the  Cambodia  Road  Improvement \nProject,  involved  relocation  of  around  2,100  households  with  more  than  3,400  people. \nHousehold  interviews  and  focus  group  discussions  in  Banteay  Meanchey  and  Siem  Reap \nprovinces  revealed  that  most  of  the  affected  people  owned  some  form  of  cottage  stores \nalong  the  roads  and  felt  that  the  monetary  compensation  provided  was  not  adequate  to \nreopen  their  businesses  in  new  sites.  Also,  they  had  not  been  informed  about  the \ncompensation rate (Ritty 2008). \n\n3.2.2 \n\nIncomplete Connectivity Penalizing Outcome \n\nWhen road construction along an expected transport corridor is left incomplete, the outcome \nis  penalized  to  the  extent  of  such  incompleteness.  For  example,  although  it  was  observed \nthat  since  completion  of  the  Champasak  Road  Improvement  Project,  the  number  of  trucks \ngoing  from  southern  Lao PDR  toward  the  Cambodian  border  increased  sixfold,  very  few \ntrucks  actually  cross  the  border  due  to  the  absence  of  the  final  6.9-kilometer  link  road. \nTherefore,  trading  of  goods  by  river  from  the  border  jetty  is  more  common  for  now.  This \nhappened because there was a conflict between Lao PDR and Cambodia as to the location \nof  the  border  demarcation.  This  is  a  case  in  which  an  incomplete  border  link  prevents  full \nrealization  of  expected  cross-border  benefits.  The  PRC  government  has  expressed  its \nsupport to complete the missing part of the road. \n\nThere  is  also  a  case  in  which  a  time  lag  between  different  donor  assistance  projects  has \ncreated  a  temporary  missing  link  in  a  transport  corridor.  For  example,  the  Phnom  Penh\u2013\nHCMC route is currently incomplete with the remaining bottleneck being the upgrading of the \nPhnom Penh\u2013Neak Leoung section (61 kilometers) and construction of the bridge over the \nMekong  River  (under  construction  with  Japanese  aid  and  expected  to  be  completed  by \n2010). There is heavy traffic from HCMC westward toward the Cambodian border and many \nindustrial estates along the road are developing outward from HCMC. However, noticeable \ncross-border industrial linkages do not appear to have developed between the Phnom Penh \nand HCMC economies. Obvious economic integration so far seems concentrated at the Moc \nBai\u2013Bavet border areas (Fujimura 2008). \n\n3.3 \n\nImpact Monitoring During Operation \n\nCapacity and resource constraints tend to be a persistent issue in impact monitoring starting \nwith the baseline survey and benchmarking. The area of environmental impact tends to be \nmost  affected  by  these  constraints.  For  example,  during  the  implementation  of  the  Theun-\nHinboun Hydropower Project, the Theun-Hinboun Power Company (THPC) established the \nEnvironmental  Management  Committee  Office  comprising  local  staff  to  manage  mitigation \nand  compensation  issues.  However,  its  staff  capacity  was  low  and  received  inadequate \nsupervision from the international specialists. As a result, THPC had to deal with impacts as \nthey  occurred,  rather  than  in  a  strategically  planned  manner.  This  became  a  serious  issue \nfrom the start of project operation. \n\n \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\n3.4  Analytical Rigor in Project Evaluation \n\nThe quality of project evaluation in different stages of the project cycle depends critically on \nthe initial analytical rigor in project preparation. In the case of cross-border projects, a crucial \npart  of  the  analysis  is  the  identification  and  quantification  of  cross-border  benefits.  Most  of \nthe  project  documents  reviewed  in  the  transport  sector  did  not  adequately  analyze  cross-\nborder  benefits  beyond  national  benefits,  although  good  attempts  were  made  in  some \nprojects. Table 2 summarizes the review on this aspect. \n\nTable 2: Analysis of Cross-Border Benefits in Transport Projects \n\nProject \nChampasak Road \nImprovement \nPhnom Penh to Ho \nChi Minh City \nHighway \nImprovement  \n\nSouthern Yunnan \nRoad Development  \n\nComment \n\nBroader impacts on trade and tourism were discussed but not \nquantified. \nThe EIRR for the overall project is 26% when \u201csubregion benefits\u201d \nare considered and 23% when they are not. Cross-border benefits \nare based only on projected traffic diverted from other transport \nmodes and do not consider wider external impacts through trade \nand investment. \nTraffic projection accounts for an increase in cross-border traffic \nfrom 2005 onward after completion of the Northern Economic \nCorridor Project, the connecting road from the project road. \nHowever, estimation of cross-border benefits did not account for \nthis. \n\nEast\u2013West Corridor   Cross-border traffic formed the basis for subregional benefits in the \n\ncalculation of EIRR. Overall, EIRR was estimated to be 19% \nwithout and 23% with subregional benefits. While this is the first \nclear case of explicitly presenting cross-border benefits above the \nsum of national benefits, the analysis did not go further in capturing \nwider benefits associated with increased trade flows, which were \ndiscussed but not integrated into economic calculation. \nTwo types of distribution analyses were done: that between \ncountries and that within Lao PDR by different functional groups. \nHowever, additional cross-border external benefits beyond the sum \nof national net benefits were not identified. Also, wider impacts \nthrough changes in trade, investment, and tourist flows were not \ncaptured. \nDistribution of project benefits was discussed qualitatively but not \nquantified. No distinction of cross-border benefits despite explicit \nSingapore\u2013Kunming link. \nSubregional benefits associated with increased trade and reduced \ntransport costs to coastal ports were discussed but not quantified. \n\nSubregional benefits associated with reduced travel time between \nKunming and Haiphong, alleviation of traffic congestion in cities and \ntowns, and generation of employment opportunities were discussed \nbut not quantified. \nTraffic forecasts were made partly based on analysis of regional \ntrade and tourism patterns, but cross-border benefits were not \nquantified. \nDistribution analysis was done for each country component \n(Cambodia and Viet Nam) and for the project road as a whole, but \ndid not distinguish cross-border benefits that national road projects \nwould not have separately obtained, despite reference to \n\nNorthern Economic \nCorridor \n\nRehabilitation of the \nRailway in \nCambodia  \nKunming\u2013Haiphong \nTransport Corridor: \nYen Vien\u2013Lao Cai \nRailway Upgrading  \nKunming\u2013Haiphong \nTransport Corridor: \nNoi Bai\u2013Lao Cai \nHighway \nNorthern GMS \nTransport Network \nImprovement \nGMS Southern \nCoastal Corridor \n\n \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nAlmaty\u2013Bishkek \nRegional Road \nRehabilitation  \nDushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nBorder Road \nRehabilitation I \nDushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nBorder Road \nRehabilitation II \n\nRegional Road \nDevelopment \n\nProject \nEast\u2013West Highway \nImprovement \nCAREC Regional \nRoad Corridor \nImprovement \n\n\u201cenormous potential\u201d to facilitate movement of goods and people \nbetween the two countries. \nSubregional benefits were not calculated due to lack of origin and \ndestination data and quantities and types of freight and passenger \ntraffic. \nInternational generated traffic was separately treated in EIRR \ncalculation but not made the basis for estimating cross-border \nbenefits. \nInteresting attempt made on distribution analysis based on \nexpected increase in four types of trade flows: Tajikistan\u2013Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Tajikistan\u2013PRC, PRC\u2013Afghanistan, and transit trade \nthrough Pakistan. \nThe appraisal analyzed domestic and international trade flows, \nassociated benefits due to the project, and their distribution among \nMongolia, PRC, and Russia. However, \u201cadditional\u201d cross-border \nbenefits beyond the sum of national benefits were not separated. \n\nComment \n\nCross-border benefits were not identified or quantified despite the \nobviously regional nature of the road. \n\u201cInternational traffic\u201d based on generated and diverted traffic was \ndistinguished in quantifying cross-border benefits, but it is unclear \nhow wider impacts on trade and investments are related to this \ntraffic.  \n\nCAREC = Central Asian Regional Cooperation; EIRR = estimated economic rate of return; GMS = Greater Mekong \nSubregion; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation. \n\nIt should be noted, however, that some road projects do not have adequate clues with which \nto  benchmark  cross-border  traffic.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  the  Northern  Economic \nCorridor  Project,  the  project  road  was  impassable  for  several  months  of  a  year  and  traffic \nprojection  had  to  be  based  on  the  traffic  in  the  areas  where  the  existing  traffic  was \nconsidered  proximate  to  how  the  traffic  might  be  generated  after  project  completion. \nSimilarly,  in  the  case  of  the  GMS  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  Project,  the  Viet Nam\u2013\nCambodia border was closed to international traffic prior to the project, making quantitative \nbenchmarking  for  cross-border  traffic  impossible.  Practitioners  face  a  practical  problem  of \nweighing the accounting of benefits to demonstrate economic viability, e.g., beyond certain \ncutoff  criteria  of  economic  rate  of  return,  against  the  corresponding  cost  of  collecting \nadditional data and information. As a result, benefit quantification tends toward conservative \nestimates.  \n\n3.5  Patterns of Emerging Outcomes and Impacts: Macro- and \n\nMicro-Level Evidence \n\nMindful  of  the  numerous  pitfalls  and  subtleties  listed  above,  many  studies,  albeit  less  than \nthe  ideal  of  randomized  evaluation,  have  produced  interesting  results  indicating  emerging \noutcomes  and  impacts  of  cross-border  infrastructure  projects  implemented  in  Asia.  At  the \nmacro  level,  cross-border  infrastructure  reduces  trade  costs,  leading  to  more  trade  and \ninvestment, and then to growth. At the micro level, cross-border infrastructure can benefit the \npoor  by  improving  their  income  opportunities  and  access  to  labor  markets  and  social \nservices.  Here,  we  summarize  notable  findings  based  on  the  review  of  available  project \ndocuments  and  studies  undertaken  by  ADB  and  others.  They  are  mainly  related  to  cross-\nborder infrastructure projects in the transport sector. \n\n \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n3.5.1 \n\n Macro-Level Evidence  \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nTwo  types  of  approaches  have  been  used  in  analyzing  the  macro  impact  of  regional \ninfrastructure  development:  econometric  analysis  using  panel  data  and  simulation  analysis \nusing CGE models. While these studies have limitations in isolating the impacts of individual \nprojects, they offer insights on the aggregate-level impact of infrastructure development. For \nexample,  Edmonds  and Fujimura (2008)  used  a gravity  model  using  panel  data from GMS \ncountries to  analyze  the  determinants  of  regional  trade  and  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI) \nflows. The study found that cross-border road development (expressed in road density) has \nhad a distinctively positive impact on regional trade flow, controlling for other factors. Menon \nand  Warr  (2008)  constructed  a  multi-sector,  multi-household  general  equilibrium  model  to \nquantify  the  effect  of  rural  road  improvement  on  poverty  incidence  in  the  Lao PDR.  They \nfound different impacts depending on the type of road improvement. For example, upgrading \nof  no-access  roads  to  dry-season-access  roads  has  a  far  larger  impact  on  household \npoverty  compared  with  upgrading  dry-season-only  roads  to  all-weather  roads.  This  implies \nthat  given  the  Lao PDR\u2019s  landlocked  location,  improving  rural  road  networks,  which  would \npractically  connect  to  either  one  of  its  neighbor  countries  (e.g.,  Champasak  Road \nImprovement Project), can significantly enhance the welfare of poor households.  \n\nIn  a  forward-looking  study  of  the  CAREC  region,  ADB  (2006c)  used  a  multi-sector  CGE \nmodel  to  simulate  the  economic  impact  of  regional  cooperation  in  transport,  transit,  and \ntrade  policy,  focusing  on  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Its  results  indicate  that  the  cumulative \nincrease in the country\u2019s real gross domestic product in 2006\u20132015 would be far higher than \nthe baseline scenario without regional cooperation and that the average cumulative increase \nin the incomes of poor households could be almost doubled over the same period. \n\n Micro-Level Evidence \n\n3.5.2 \nMicro-level studies use primary and secondary data collected from qualitative and \nquantitative surveys (e.g., baseline and post-implementation surveys) and related \nmethodologies such as rapid pilot assessments, case studies, and participatory \nassessments. Findings from these studies are summarized here in the order of short- to \nmedium- and long-run impacts, and from positive to negative impacts, that are observed at \nthe micro level.  \n\nReduced Travel Time and Transport Cost  \n\nAn immediate outcome of building cross-border transport infrastructure is reduction in travel \ntime  and  transport  cost.  In  the  case  of  the  Champasak  Road  Improvement  Project,  travel \ntime from the Thai\u2013Lao PDR border at Vung Tau to the Lao PDR\u2013Cambodia border of Veun \nKham via Pakse was reduced by more than half, and travel costs fell for those using private \ntransport. Also, the cost of public transport decreased by more than 20% in real terms (ADB \n2008). In the case of the Phnom Penh\u2013HCMC Highway Project, the average time required to \nreach local health care services has fallen by about 30%, while travel times to schools and \nmarkets are down by about 40% (Phyrum, Sothy, and Horn 2007). In the case of the East\u2013\nWest  Corridor  Project,  travel  time  from  the  Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam  border  of  Dansavanh  to \nKhanthabouly  on  Road  9  was  reduced  from  about  12  hours  in  2001  to  2.5\u20133.0  hours \n(Rattanatay 2007). In the case of the North\u2013South Economic Corridor via the Lao PDR, after \nthe  completion  of  the  Lao PDR  road  section,  travel  time  from  Bangkok  to  Kunming  was \nreduced from 78 hours in 2000 to 51 hours in 2006, and is projected to be further reduced to \n30 hours in 2015. Correspondingly, the cost of transporting one ton of rubber products from \nBangkok  to  Kunming  was  reduced  from  US$563  in  2000  to  US$392  in  2006,  and  is \nprojected  to  be  further  reduced  to  US$210  in  2015  (Banomyong  2007).  In  the  case  of  the \nAlmaty\u2013Bishkek  Regional  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  travel  time  was  reduced  by  at  least \n50% from 5\u20136 to 2\u20133 hours (ADB 2008). Transport costs for exporting fruits and vegetables \nfrom Bishkek to Novosibirsk decreased from US$3,700\u20133,900 in 2001 to US$3,500\u20133,700 in \n2004 (Ganiev 2005). \n\n \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\nIncreased Traffic \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nReduced transport costs generate increased traffic. After the completion of the Champasak \nRoad  Improvement  Project,  traffic  volume  on  the  project  route  grew  at  an  average  annual \nrate  of  22%  against  the  projected  growth  rate  of  5.0\u20137.5%  (post  evaluation  in  2005).  The \nnumber  of  passenger  buses  on  Road  9  in  the  Lao PDR  along  the  East\u2013West  Economic \nCorridor increased from about 600 buses in 2000 to around 1,560 buses in 2005, while the \nnumber  of  freight  operators  also  doubled  over  the  same  period  (Rattanatay  2007).  Traffic \nvolume  on  the  route  of  the  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  Regional  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  grew  by \n25% after 2007 (ADB 2008). \n\nExpanded Trade \n\nIncreased traffic is explained by the expansion of regional trade due to the reduced transport \ncosts,  particularly  over  land  in  the  case  of  road  projects.  For  example,  trade  between \nCambodia  and  southern  Viet Nam  along  the  Southern  Economic  Corridor  increased  by \nabout 40% per year between 2003 and 2006 (ADB 2008). For Savannakhet Province as a \nwhole,  which  is  Lao PDR\u2019s  transit  province  along  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor,  the \namount of exports and imports increased by 24 times and 39 times, respectively, in 2001\u2013\n2005  (Rattanatay  2007).  Exports  from  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  Kazakhstan  increased  by \n160%  between  1998  and  2007,  presumably  due  in  part  to  the  completion  of  the  Almaty\u2013\nBishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project (ADB 2008). \n\nInduced Investments \n\nImproved  cross-border  transport  infrastructure  induces  investments  for  new  economic \nactivities.  In  anticipation  of  a  closer  economic  link  between  Viet Nam  and  Cambodia, \nindustrial  districts  on  the  Viet Nam  side  along  the  Southern  Economic  Corridor  are \ndeveloping, such as the Trang Bang Industrial Park, which is generating many jobs for the \nlocal  population  (ADB  2008).  In  a  field  survey  on  the  corridor,  70%  of  the  respondents \nshowed  an  interest  in  owning  a  small  business  or  expanding  their  current  one  in  the  post-\ndevelopment  period,  12%  showed  an  interest  in  expanding  their  agricultural  activities,  and \n9%  expected  to  work  in  a  factory  job  if  available  (Phyrum  et  al.  2007).  FDI  is  attracted  to \nplaces  where  transport  costs  are  low  and  resource  complementarity  is  high.  The  value  of \nFDI and joint ventures in Savannakhet Province increased from only US$96 million in 1995\u2013\n2000  to  US$250  million  in  2001\u20132005.  Of  these  FDI  projects,  53%  are  in  agriculture,  and \nvillagers  in  the  province  have  been  engaged  increasingly  in  activities  sponsored  by  these \nprojects such as silk and cotton production, weaving, and handicrafts (Rattanatay 2007). \n\nEnhanced Tourism \n\nPart of the increased traffic volume is related to the increased number of visitors and tourists. \nThere  was  a  128%  increase  in  the  number  of  tourists  visiting  Champasak  Province  of  the \nLao PDR between 1998 and 2004 partly due to the Champasak Road Improvement Project \n(post evaluation in 2005). The number of visitors including tourists crossing the Cambodia\u2013\nViet Nam  border  at  Bavet\u2013Moc  Bai,  rose  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  about  53%,  and \nvehicles crossing the border increased at an average annual rate of 38% between 2003 and \n2006  (ADB  2008).  In  Savannakhet  Province,  the  number  of  tourist  arrivals  increased  from \n90,910  in  1999  to  222,063  in  2006.  Following  the  opening  of  the  Second  Mekong \nInternational Bridge, the number of tourist arrivals increased by 8% in the first two months of \n2007.  More  than  half  of  such  tourism  involves  regional  tours  covering  Thailand,  Lao PDR, \nand  Viet Nam  (Rattanatay  2007).  Tourists  visiting  Kyrgyz  Republic  increased  by  50%  to \nabout  one  million  between  2005  and  2007,  partly  due  to  the  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  road \nimprovement  and  its  associated  border  facility  improvement,  and  partly  due  to  the \ncomplementary  private  sector  investments  in  accommodation  and  services  at  key  tourist \ndestinations  in  the  country.  A  similar  development  is  likely  to  happen  along  the  Southern \nEconomic Corridor because the route passes through all of Cambodia\u2019s designated tourism \nzones (Angkor, Phnom Penh, and coastal zones). \n\n \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nEnhanced Movement of People and Income Opportunities \n\nEnhanced  movement  of  people  leads  not  only  to  increased  short-run  tourism  but  also  to \nincreased long-run labor mobility. For example, magnitudes of labor movement in GMS have \nbeen significant. Even Saravan Province in the Lao PDR, which is off the direct East\u2013West \nCorridor  route,  has  sent  significant  numbers  of  cross-border  workers  to  Cambodia  and \nThailand\u2014implying  a  far  reaching  impact  of  wage-differential  incentives.  Enhanced  labor \nmobility  improves  household  income  opportunities.  Overall,  the  situation  for  cross-border \nworkers in GMS seems to have improved over 2001\u20132005 as their perceived changes were \nlargely for the better in terms of working conditions, ease of crossing the border, and wage \nlevel (Singh and Mitra 2006). \n\nIncreased Income and Improved Living Standards of Households \n\nEvidence  is  emerging  on  increased  income  and  improved  living  standards  of  households \nunder  the  influence  of  cross-border  transport  infrastructure  projects.  About  46%  of \nhouseholds  in  the  influence  area  of  the  Champasak  Road  Improvement  Project  increased \ntheir  agricultural  output  for  sale  at  local  markets  and  increased  their  incomes  (post \nevaluation  in  2005). Of  the  respondents to the  survey  on  the  Southern Economic  Corridor, \n70% claimed their living standards had improved while 23% said there had been no changes \nand 7% complained of being worse off, amounting to a generally favorable perception of the \ndevelopmental  impact  (Phyrum  et  al.  2007).  Between  1994  and  2000,  gross  domestic \nproduct in the six municipalities and counties in the influence area of the Southern Yunnan \nRoad Development Project increased by 1.9 times on average, significantly higher than the \nnational  average  of  1.4  times.  During  the  same  period,  US$390  million  was  paid  to  the \nworkers  as  wages. The number of tourists  in the  project  area  also rose fivefold,  leading  to \nsignificant  spillover  effects  (ADB  2008).  These  are  considered  to  be  the  initial  impacts  of \nvarious  investments  along  the  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  on  the  Yunnan  side.  The \nmajority of people living in districts along the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, who previously \nin \ndepended  on  subsistence \ncommercialized  agricultural  production  of  such  products  as  livestock,  poultry,  sugarcane, \ncassava, bananas, watermelon, and tree plantations for domestic and international markets. \nAs the East\u2013West Corridor Project included rural access road components, its benefits also \nreached  households  located  far  off  Road  9,  contributing  to  wider  poverty  reduction \n(Rattanatay 2007). \n\nfarming  and  shifting  cultivation,  are  now  engaged \n\nGrowth in Border Cities and Towns: Agglomeration Effects \n\nAs movement of goods and people across borders becomes easier, the diversity of resource \nendowments among neighboring countries tends to magnify agglomeration effects in which \nentrepreneurs  exploit  new  arbitrage  opportunities  and  combine  resources  with  varying \ncompetitive  advantage  across  borders.  While  it  is  still  too  early  to  detect  the  extent  of \nagglomeration  effects  attributable  to  specific  projects,  one  can  safely  associate  noticeable \ndevelopments at border areas at least partly with the progress in cross-border infrastructure, \nin  terms  of  both  physical  infrastructure  and  accompanying  institutions  and  regulatory \narrangements. For example, the garment industry at Poipet border areas is likely to further \nflourish  due  to  easier movement  of goods  and  people: \u201cIn  its  most  basic form, the  process \nbegins with Thai wholesalers selling Thai fabric to traders in the large Rong Kleung market. \nThese  traders  then  subcontract  or  outsource  the  production  to  Cambodian  manufacturers \nliving in the Poipet area, these manufacturers or subcontractors are usually households with \ntailoring equipment and employing 10\u201340 garment workers\u2026\u201d (Singh and Mitra 2006: 95). A \nsimilar development has been observed at the Thailand\u2013Myanmar border at the western end \nof the East\u2013West Corridor. Labor-intensive industries are becoming concentrated in Mae Sot \nDistrict  of Tak  Province,  where  Thai garment firms  employ  labor from  Myanmar  on  a  large \nscale (Kudo 2007). Also in other border areas in the GMS such as Bavet (Cambodia)\u2013Moc \nBai (Viet Nam) and Mae Sai (Thailand)\u2013Tachilek (Myanmar), initial agglomeration effects are \nobservable. \n\n \n\n20 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nDispersion along Economic Corridors to Some Extent \n\nIn some economic corridors, dispersion of economic activities from existing nodes seems to \nbe  emerging.  For  example,  district  towns  along  Road  9  in  the  Lao PDR  are  growing  fast \nwhere  new  concrete  houses,  markets,  guesthouses  and  restaurants,  trade  and  service \nactivities such as petrol stations, automobile repair shops, and other micro enterprises never \nobserved  before  in  these  remote  areas  have  been  mushrooming  (Rattanatay  2007).  The \nEast\u2013West Economic Corridor is starting to see some dispersion effects along Road 9 after \nthe  initial  agglomeration  effects  at  the  border  nodes  such  as  the  Mukdahan  (Thailand)\u2013\nSavannakhet  (Lao PDR)  and  Dansavanh  (Lao PDR)\u2013Lao  Bao  (Viet Nam)  borders.  When \ncomplementary institutions and regulatory aspects of cross-border goods movement improve, \nthe dispersion of cross-border benefits will accelerate. (See Appendix 2 on the dynamics of \nagglomeration and dispersion.) \n\nDispersion Effects Depend on Complementary Investments \n\nWhile  cross-border  benefits  are  expected  to  spread  over  time,  the  speed  of  such  diffusion \nand  its  perception  by  households  depends  on  complementary  investments  off  the  trunk \nroutes of transport corridors. For example, 45% of the survey respondents from the Southern \nEconomic  Corridor  believed  that  in  addition  to  developing  the  main  corridor,  rural \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  basic  education  and  health  care  should  be  addressed  in  order  to \nimprove  rural  livelihoods.  Responses  included  rural  roads  and  electricity  (88%),  factories \n(74%), irrigation (45%), and health and education infrastructure (37%) (Phyrum et al. 2007). \n\nRoad Accidents \n\nOne  initially  observable  negative  outcome  of  cross-border  transport  infrastructure  is  an \nincrease in accidents. Increased speed and easier border crossing can cause more frequent \nand  more  severe  accidents.  Along  Road  8  in  the  Lao PDR,  there  were  around  5,000 \naccidents  with  more  than  7,300  injuries  and  around  500  deaths  in  2005.  Along  Road  9  in \nSavannakhet  Province,  there  were  around  1,000  accidents  and  2,000  injured  with  almost \n100 deaths in the same year (Rattanatay 2007). \n\nCasino Prevalence \n\nInitial  agglomeration  effects  at  border  areas,  ironically,  often  begin  with  quick-cash \nbusinesses  such  as  casinos,  which  typically  locate  at  the  side  of  the  border  where  law \nenforcement is weaker, e.g., the Mong Cai (Viet Nam) side of the Viet Nam\u2013Guangxi border; \nthe Poipet (Cambodia) side of the Thailand\u2013Cambodia border; the Bavet (Cambodia) side of \nthe Viet Nam\u2013Cambodia border; the Tachilek (Myanmar) side of the Thai\u2013Myanmar border; \nthe Maila (Myanmar) side of the Yunnan\u2013Myanmar border; and the Boten (Lao PDR) side of \nthe Lao PDR\u2013Yunnan border. At Mong Cai, an investor based in Hong Kong, China opened \na  casino  hotel  in  2002  to  serve  tourists  from  the  PRC.  At  Poipet,  nine  casino  hotels  were \noperating by 2006 to serve Thai tourists. At Bavet, five or six casino hotels opened by 2006 \nto serve Vietnamese tourists. At Boten, a PRC company has recently been given a 30-year \nright  to  build  and  operate  the  Boten  Economic  Development  Zone  in  which  reportedly  the \nmain  draw  so  far  is  a  casino,  which  is  to  serve  tourists  from  the  PRC  and  is  off  limits  to \nLaotians. \n\nWhile these casino businesses in border areas have some positive effects in terms of cash \nrevenue to the host partners (private and public sector) and employment creation effects for \nlocal  residents  (in  unskilled  jobs  presumably),  unfavorable  social  spillover  effects  including \nthose described below can be expected not only for the host country but also for the tourist-\nsending country. In fact, at Maila (Myanmar), where the Shan State allowed PRC investors \nto  establish  casino  hotels  in  the  1990s,  crowds  of  tourists  from  the  PRC  flowed  into  the \npreviously quiet town and concern raised by the PRC authorities over the reckless behavior \nof the PRC visitors and their increasing debt led to the closure of the casino hotels by 2005 \n(Kudo 2007). \n\n \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\nSmuggling \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nPoor  people  are  often  used  as  intermediary  porters  in  smuggling  networks.  In  just  two \nexamples, poor border villagers are paid to drive smuggled motor bikes and cars across rice \nfields  and  forest  trails  along  the  Cambodia\u2013Thai  border;  and  poor  Cambodian  women  and \nchildren living in border areas are paid to wear as many Thai clothes as possible and walk \nacross the border along informal gates. They are exposed to a considerable risk (especially \nso for women) because, if caught, they are often abused verbally and sometimes physically. \nIn the  case  of  drug  smuggling, the  carriers  tend to  be  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  living  in \nthe  corridor  provinces,  such  as  street  children  in  Poipet.  They  take  the  highest  risk  in \nbecoming porters and peddlers in drug smuggling for small sums of money. Young migrant \nworkers  are  vulnerable  to  drug  abuse  because  often  their  employers  force  them  to  take \namphetamines for \u201cstrength\u201d so that they can work longer hours (Singh and Mitra 2006). In \nthe  CAREC  region,  drug  smuggling  is  a  serious  issue,  especially  along  the  road  corridors \ninvolving Afghanistan. \n\nHIV/AIDS  \n\nAmong  the  most  serious  forms  of  negative  cross-border  externalities  is  the  spread  of \ncommunicable  diseases,  especially  HIV/AIDS.  The  number  of  HIV  carriers  in  Tay  Ninh \nProvince in Viet Nam reached 1,316 by October 2005 with a marked increase during recent \nyears.  Among  Vietnamese  commercial  sex  workers  in  Svay  Rieng,  as  many  as  40%  are \nconsidered  HIV  carriers.  Out  of  1,400  HIV-infected  people  in  Lao PDR  in  2001,  872  were \nfound  in  Savannakhet  and  Saravan  provinces  alone.  Most  of  these  cases  are  found  along \nthe Thai  border  and  along  Road  9  (Singh  and Mitra  2006).  Most  of  outbreaks  of  HIV/AIDS \nand sexually transmitted diseases are found in the integrated areas along the Thai\u2013Lao PDR \nborder, such as Roads 9 and 13 (Thi 2008). \n\nHuman Trafficking \n\nHuman and drug trafficking was the most-cited concern among the survey respondents from \nthe Southern Economic Corridor (68% response rate) (Phyrum et al. 2007). There are three \nbroad  degrees  of  trafficking:  (i)  cheating  cross-border  workers  into  low  standard  jobs;  (ii) \ncheating  children  and  vulnerable  groups  into  doing  risky  and  demanding  tasks  such  as \nsmuggling,  begging,  and  drug  peddling;  and  (iii)  trafficking  for  prostitution  or  sex  work.  All \nthree forms of trafficking are commonplace along the GMS corridor provinces and are more \nconcentrated  in  areas  near  the  border  as  there  is  more  labor  migration  from  there.  Even \nwhen authorities know who traffickers are in their jurisdiction, they lack the evidence to bring \nthem to court. Witnesses are difficult to find and victims are afraid of coming forward for fear \nof being looked down on by their fellow villagers (Singh and Mitra 2006). \n\nIllegal Logging and Deforestation \n\nissue  needs \n\nforest  encroachment \n\nOpening  of  regional  transport  corridors  can  lead  to  more  illegal  logging  and  deforestation. \nMigration from outlying villages to areas adjacent to the project road in the Champasak Road \nImprovement  Project  is  resulting  in  clearing  of  forest  buffer  zones  using  slash-and-burn \ntechniques. Migrants tend to clear the forest area to build their houses and to create paddy \nto  be  better  understood  before  a \nfields.  This \ncomprehensive solution can be found (post evaluation in 2005). Given that the bulk of wood \nprocessing industries in the Lao PDR are concentrated in the central region and particularly \nin the provinces along the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, it is likely that the easier transport \nstimulates  more  illegal  logging  (Singh  and  Mitra  2006).  It  was  reported  that  landslides  and \ndeforestation increased in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province along National Road 3 of the \nNorth\u2013South  Economic  Corridor.  Forest  cover  decreased  in  the  buffer  zones  of  the  road \nwhile  rubber  plantations  increased  dramatically  along  the  road,  causing  concerns  about \nenvironmental degradation. Similar development has been observed on the Lao PDR side of \nthe  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor:  cutting  of forest  trees  on  both  sides  of the road to  be \nreplaced by monoculture crop production such as rubber and coconut plantations (Thi 2008). \n\n \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nHowever, it can be argued that the extent of illegal logging depends on the initial quality of \nthe  road  and  the  change  in  the  quality  due  to  the  project.  For  example,  if  a  project  is \nupgrading from gravel to sealed road, it would not make a difference in the extent of logging \nor smuggling. If the existing quality of the road already enables the transport of illegal logs, \nfurther improved road quality would not have an incremental negative impact. \n\n4.  LESSONS LEARNED \n\nBased  on  the  review  and  evidence  collected  above,  this  section  draws  lessons  and \nimplications for the design and implementation of cross-border infrastructure projects.  \n\n4.1  Characteristics of Successful Projects \n\nWe can detect several factors that contribute to successful preparation and implementation \nof cross-border infrastructure projects.  \n\n4.1.1  Clear Rationale in Articulation of Economic Corridor Concept \n\nFor the  East\u2013West  Corridor  Project  in the GMS, ADB\u2019s  approach  was to pursue  a  broader \nset  of  cross-border  trade  and  investment  impacts  including  the  promotion  of  special \nproduction and trade zones that will support the concept of economic corridors. The project \nrationale  was  based  on  long-run  cross-border  benefits  along  the  line  of  agglomeration  and \ndispersion,  making clear  the  economic  rationale  of  the  project from  a regional  perspective. \nSimilarly, project documents for road projects in CAREC countries (Numbers 17, 19, 20, and \n22 in Appendix 3) have been relatively well articulated regarding the nature of cross-border \nimpacts. This may be partly owing to the fact that these countries are all landlocked and it is \nrelatively easy to put road sections in these countries in a larger picture of regional and inter-\nregional  corridors.  As  the  CAREC  transport  sector  master  plan  identifies  six  economic \ncorridors  across  member  countries,  road  projects  included  in  these  corridors  would  all  be \nconsidered cross-border road projects. \n\n4.1.2  Use of Distribution Analysis as a Guide for a Win-Win Design \n\nA  properly  prepared  distribution  analysis  can  help  adjust  project  design  for  a  win-win \ndirection.  For  example,  the  appraisal  analysis  for  the  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project \nindicated a disproportionate share of the benefits from saved vehicle operating costs in favor \nof Thailand and the PRC and against the Lao PDR. Particularly the benefits associated with \ndiverted  traffic  were  projected  to  accrue  to  Thai  and  PRC  stakeholders.  However,  two \nimplicit  compensation  mechanisms  assumed  in  the  project  arrangement  make  up  for  the \notherwise unfavorable distributional outcome for the Lao PDR. The first is the transit fee to \nbe  collected  by  the  Lao PDR  government  from  the  road  users  including  those  originating \nfrom Thailand and the PRC. The second is the concessional loans (net financial transfer due \nto the favorable terms of the government loans compared to commercial loans) provided by \nthe Thai and PRC governments to the Lao PDR government. These arrangements counter \nproject costs disproportionately borne by the Lao PDR government and potential social and \nenvironmental  effects  that  would  mainly  accrue  to  people  in  the  Lao PDR.  Given  that  they \nhelp ensure a win-win outcome, the project document could have elaborated more on these \ncompensating arrangements in project design. \n\n4.1.3  Fair Chance of Success in Public\u2013Private Partnership in the Energy Sector \n\nIn the energy sector, where potential private demand and supply can meet across borders, \nthere is a fair chance of forming a \u201cclub\u201d without having to mobilize extensive resources from \nthe  public  sector.  Cross-border  power  projects  can  capture  economies  of  scale  and  be \nattractive to international private sector investors. Exportability means bankability for private \n\n \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nsector financiers. For example, the Theun-Hinbon Hydropower Project can serve as a model \nfor  a  successful  public\u2013private  partnership.  It  has  achieved  its  intended  purpose  and  is \ncurrently  the  largest  foreign  exchange  source  for  the  Lao PDR.  Sales  revenues  for  the \nTheun-Hinbon  Power  Company  (THPC)  increased  from  US$42  million  in  1998  to  US$57 \nmillion  in  2005  and  are  expected  to  maintain  that  level  in  the  future.  THPC\u2019s  dividend \npayments  in  2003\u20132005  amounted  to  US$78  million,  of  which  US$47  million  went  to \nElectricite  du  Laos. In  2004, THPC  started to  pay  taxes  at  about  US$3 million  a  year. The \nproject is rated highly relevant, highly efficacious, highly efficient, and likely to be sustainable \n(ADB 2006b). \n\n4.1.4  Some Aspects of Transport Infrastructure Can Bypass Various Constraints \n\nEven  where  diseconomies  of  scale  prevail,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Pacific  countries,  some \ntypes  of  transport  infrastructure  services  can  be  provided  collectively.  The  fee-based \nprofessional  services  by  the  Pacific  Aviation  Safety  Office  can  be  considered  a  club  good. \nAn  appropriate  model  of  governance  is  easier  to  achieve  when  there  are  no  incumbent \nproviders  to  oppose  reform.  The  Pacific  Aviation  Safety  Office  is  the  first  example  of  a \nregional  organization that  Pacific  developing member  countries  have  been  willing to  set  up \non  a  self-financing  basis  without  donor  grants.  It  is  likely  to  serve  as  a  model  for  future \nintergovernmental regional cooperation, particularly in transport and regulation infrastructure \nand services (Guild 2008). \n\nICT Sector Has a Chance of Successful Cross-Border Coordination if Not Finance  \n\nThe  ICT  sector  is  primarily  private  sector-oriented  and  the  services  involved  are  close  to \npure  private  goods.  Therefore,  public  intervention  is  not  much  required.  However,  regional \ncontext  may  necessitate  coordination  by  a  regional  public  agency  like  ADB.  The  SASEC \nInformation  Highway  Project  is  a  case  in  point.  Several  favorable  conditions  helped  the \nsuccessful  formulation  of  the  project:  (i)  ICT  is  a  new  sector  for  cooperation  and  did  not \ninvolve as much political economy as in the energy and transport sectors; (ii) ICT does not \ninvolve visible movement of people and goods, so it poses little perceived threat and anxiety; \nand (iii) the physical network had been laid and the project is simply to connect the national \nnetwork  across  borders. With  this  first  concrete  cross-border  infrastructure  project  in  place \nand learning effects in cooperation, the SASEC program may advance further in the future. \n\nInstitutional Learning-by-Doing in Regional Cooperation \n\nPreparation  of  cross-border  infrastructure  projects  with  multilateral  facilitation  can  have \npositive institutional learning effects. For example, in the process of preparing road projects \nassociated  with  the  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor,  multilateral  cooperation  promoted  a \ncooperative  relationship  between  the  PRC  (particularly  Yunnan  and  Guangxi)  and  the \nneighboring  countries.  The  second  GMS  Summit  held  in  Kunming  in  July  2005  was \npreceded  by  several  senior  officials\u2019  meetings  and  symposiums.  This  not  only  helped  in \nkeeping  the  commitment  to  regional  cooperation  among  governments  but  also  has  been \neffective  in  attracting  international  attention  and  support  (Cao  2008).  Learning-by-doing  in \ncoordination  between  central  and  provincial  authorities  should  also  be  highlighted.  The \nNorthern Economic Corridor Project, for example, provided the venue for better coordination \nbetween Yunnan Province and Beijing, Chiang Rai Province and Bangkok, and Bokeo and \nLuangnamtha provinces and Vientiane. As the project preparation progressed, according to \nADB  staff,  provincial  authorities  took  proactive  roles  over  the  central  authorities  and \nenhanced local ownership of the project. \n\n4.2  Ensuring Quality at Entry \n\nIt is important to ensure project quality at the entry point of the project cycle. In this case, this \nmeans ensuring quality specific to cross-border projects at the project preparation stage, as \nit will be carried through to the subsequent stages of the project cycle. \n\n \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\n4.2.1  Ambiguity over Project Objective Leading to Inadequate Analysis \n\nWhen  poverty  reduction  is  emphasized  as  an  overarching  objective,  it  often  appears  to \novershadow  the  regional  or  subregional  nature  of  projects.  In  such  cases,  analysis  of  net \nbenefit  distribution  is  often  neglected  or  given  low  priority  (see  Box  1  above).  More \nconsistency is required. \n\n4.2.2  Need for Clearer Account of Cross-Border Externalities and Improved \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\nFor  road  projects  that  are  critical  parts  of  economic  corridors,  projection  of  generated \ninternational  traffic  should  be  translated  into  \u201cadditional  cross-border  benefits\u201d  even  under \nthe  conventional  VOC  and  time  savings  framework.  For  those  that  form  transit  routes  in \neconomic  corridors,  generated  transit  traffic  and  trade  are  presumably  additional  cross-\nborder benefits that would not occur with national roads alone. For example, in the case of \nthe Northern Economic Corridor Project in the Lao PDR, transit traffic between Thailand and \nYunnan  that  is  forecast  to  be  newly  generated  is  clearly  part  of  the  cross-border  impacts \nnational  road  investments  would  not  have  achieved  alone.  Even  for  roads  that  are  not  in \ntransit  routes,  part  of  the  generated  international  traffic  that  would  not  occur  unless \ninvestments  had  explicit  cross-border  implications  should  be  estimated  and  translated  into \ncross-border  benefits.  As  an  extension,  wider  impacts  on  trade,  investment,  and  tourism \nshould be identified and quantified to the extent practical. \n\n4.2.3  Need for Inter-Modal Analysis \n\nDue  to  limited  geographical  advantages,  some  transport  corridor  routes  such  as  the \nSouthern Economic Corridor in GMS might face competition with sea transport. Even when \nthe  physical  and  non-physical  bottlenecks  are  eliminated,  the  advantage  of  the  land \ntransport  along  this  corridor  may  be  limited  unless  flows  of  traffic  between  Bangkok  and \nHCMC  become  very  smooth  and  time  savings  become  significant.  While  short-distance \njourneys  along  the  road  corridor  will  maintain  their  competitive  advantage,  long-haul \njourneys  will  face  competition  with  alternative  transport  modes.  Long-term  projection  of \nagglomeration  and  dispersion  effects  along  economic  corridors  should  account  for  the \nalternative  routes  and,  if  necessary,  consider  the  most  efficient  inter-modal  transport \nsystems for private businesses to follow up with complementary investments. \n\n4.3 \n\n.Baseline Survey and Benchmarking of Outputs, Outcomes, \nand Impacts \n\nResource  constraints  often  make  baseline  data  unavailable  for  post  evaluation.  Baseline \nindicators  are  often  at  best  collected  by  supervision  consultants  at the  beginning  of project \nimplementation. This can cause a serious problem later because the government executing \nagency  often  lacks  the  capacity  or  incentive  to  monitor  the  progress  on  the  indicators.  For \nexample, as virtually no baseline data were available in the Lao PDR during the elaboration \nof the environmental impact evaluation for the Theun-Hinbon Hydropower Project, much of \nthe environmental investigation was left to local personnel with limited experience. \n\nIt  is  often  impossible  to  measure  project  impacts  in  a  regional  perspective.  Sometimes \nseparate project completion analyses are done instead of one coherent analysis of national- \nand  regional-level  impacts  (e.g.,  Phnom  Penh\u2013HCMC  Highway  Project).  The  problem \nusually  goes  back  to  inadequate  identification  of  measurable  indicators  and  collection  of \nbaseline data. While benchmarking of impacts (e.g., traffic and trade) may be difficult for new \nroad projects, it is easier for road rehabilitation and upgrading projects. \n\n \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\n4.4 \n\nImpact Monitoring and Risk Management \n\n4.4.1  Measurable and Quantifiable Performance Indicators for Cross-Border Effects \n\nPerformance  targets  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  cross-border  projects \nshould  be  easily  measurable  and  quantifiable  to  be  compatible  with  the  resource  and \ncapacity constraints of the executing and implementing agencies. For example, the CAREC \nRegional Road Corridor Improvement Project offers some good examples. Impact indicators \nare  bilateral  trade  volume  by  origin  and  destination,  and  outcome  indicators  are  daily \ninternational  freight  traffic;  traffic  accidents  on  the  corridor;  travel  time  between  border \npoints;  number  of children  in  the  project  area  attending  secondary  school;  and  agricultural, \nhorticultural, and livestock production in the project area. \n\n4.4.2  More Care Required in Monitoring of Negative Externalities \n\nNegative  socioeconomic  impacts  often  do  not  receive  adequate  attention  at  the  time  of \nproject  design  and  implementation.  Project  administrators  often  react  to  what  happens  on \nthe ground rather than take preemptive actions. For example, in response to the perceived \nhigher  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  at  road  construction  sites  and  the  neighbor  communities,  they \nmobilize  nongovernmental  organizations  and  women\u2019s  groups  to  monitor  and  mitigate  the \nimpact. FDI projects attracted by cross-border road projects might deprive people in the host \ncountry  of  sources  of  their  livelihood,  such  as  forest  resources  (the  Lao PDR  is  one  such \ncase). Cross-border road projects also run the risk of a large influx of migrant laborers from \nneighbor  countries  that  might  settle  permanently  and  cause  social  friction.  Preventive  and \nmitigation measures against these risks need to be considered well in advance. \n\nHydropower projects involve unique risks. Trans-basin projects such as the Theun-Hinboun \nHydropower  Project,  even  when  quasi-run-of-river  in  design  and  operation,  can  have \nsignificant  environmental  and  social  impacts.  Their  implementation  should  not  proceed \nwithout developing adequate baseline data and designing a comprehensive mitigation plan. \nSufficient  time  and  staff  should  be  allocated  for  this  purpose.  In  order  to  mitigate  resource \nconstraints  on  the  part  of  the  developing  countries,  donors  could  provide  funds  for \nenvironmental  and  social  mitigation  after  plant  operation  and  to  specify  clear  and \nmeasurable performance indicators. \n\nLessons drawn from the evaluation of power projects during preparation of the Nam Theun 2 \nHydroelectric Project included the following:  \n\nEarly  comprehensive  assessment  of  economic  and  social \nnecessary; \n\nimpacts \n\nis \n\nBaseline data needs to be established; \n\nDownstream impacts of trans-basin projects are often underestimated; \n\nLivelihood restoration should be emphasized more; \n\nA comprehensive monitoring mechanism is needed during implementation and \noperations; \n\nSufficient funds are needed for environmental and social mitigation; and \n\nStrengthened  capacity  is  needed  to  implement  and  monitor  the  project \neffectively. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n4.4.3  Crowding Out of Informal Businesses by Cross-Border Transport \n\nInfrastructure \n\nAs evidenced in Singh and Mitra (2006), there seems to be a trade-off between formal and \ninformal  trade.  Owing  to the  nature  of formal trade,  which  makes  it  easier to  sustain  larger \nand  more  formal  enterprises,  the  smaller  border  traders  are  at  risk  of  being  crowded  out. \n\n \n\n26 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nBigger  foreign  retailers  come  into  the  border  markets  to  sell  their  brands  directly, \noutperforming  petty  traders.  Similarly,  increasing  formalization  of  cross-border  trucks  not \nhaving  to  transship  freight  at  borders  would  allow  large  logistics  companies  to  crowd  out \npetty  transport  operators  such  as  cart  pushers  and  loading  and  unloading  laborers  who \ngenerally  belong  o  the  poorer  economic  strata.  While  this  may  be  somewhat  inevitable, \nassociated risks and possible mitigation measures might be considered. \n\n4.5  Policy and Institutional Challenges \n\n4.5.1  Need for Complementary Policy Development in Border-Crossing Procedures \n\nWhen  physical  construction  of  cross-border  infrastructure  is  completed,  institutional  and \nregulatory aspects involved in moving goods and people across borders become the largest \nconstraint  to  fully  realizing  cross-border  externalities.  The  effectiveness  of  a  given  corridor \nfor  private  sector  businesses  depends  on  the  cost  of  crossing  borders.  For  example, \nBanomyong\u2019s  (2007)  analysis  indicates  that  as  much  as  60%  of  the  total  transport  cost \nbetween Bangkok and Kunming in 2006 was related to two border-crossing and transit fees. \n\n4.5.2  Need for Flexibility in Preparation and Implementation \nEven a small conflict between participating governments, for instance over the location of \nborder demarcation, can cause an incomplete connectivity and reduced impact, as was the \ncase in the Champasak Road Improvement Project. In the case of the Almaty\u2013Bishkek \nRegional Road Rehabilitation Project, making effective bilateral cross-border transport \nagreements a prerequisite for investments temporarily stalled project advancement. In the \ncase of GMS, while the Cross-Border Transport Agreement has been signed by all member \ngovernments (which took nine years), its smooth implementation faces political resistance \nby some parties and often inter-agency rivalry among the transport ministry, agricultural \nministry, customs office, immigration office, and security authority. While institutions and \nregulatory aspects are necessary complements to physical construction of roads, issues \ninvolved in cross-border movement of goods and people can be complex and politically \nsensitive. A flexible approach is advised. \n\n4.5.3  Role of Regional Agency in Mitigating Investment Risks and Avoiding Unfair \n\nContracts \n\nEven when power projects can be wholly funded by private sector investors and financiers, \nregional  agencies  like  ADB  play  a  critical  role  in  mitigating  perceived  risks  by  supporting \nregulatory reforms as well as ensuring fair purchase contracts among the stakeholders. \n\nIn  the  case  of  the  Theun-Hinboun  Hydropower  Project,  a  power  purchase  agreement  was \nsigned with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand in 1996 guaranteeing an offtake \nof  95%  of  THPC  estimated  to  average  1.645  gigawatt  hours  per  annum.  But  the  power \npurchase agreement proved to have both positive and negative features for THPC. While the \nquantity of electricity sold was guaranteed, the sales revenue depended on two key factors: \n(i) annual tariff increase of only 1% in nominal terms implied a decrease in real terms if the \nUnited States inflation rate was higher and (ii) the Asian financial crisis had drawn attention \nto  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates.  Donor  agencies  like  ADB  should,  if  requested,  provide \nassistance in drafting and negotiating power purchase agreements. \n\nIn the case of the Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project, with support from the World Bank and \nADB,  the  Lao PDR  government  has  formulated  a  public  expenditure  management \nstrengthening  program  in  order  to  enhance  efficiency  and  transparency.  Previously, \ndividends from government  investments  in the  power  sector  have  remained  with  Electricite \ndu Laos to subsidize electricity tariffs instead of supporting poverty reduction programs. \n\n \n\n27 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\n4.5.4  Entangled Political Issues May Stall Projects \n\nEven  with  good  rationale  and  analysis  of  cross-border  benefits,  a  regional  project  may  be \nstalled  by  context-specific  political  problems.  This  was  the  case  with  the  Regional  Power \nTransmission  Modernization  Project  between  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan,  which  was \ncanceled after a few years of preparation because the power purchase agreement was not \nsigned. Issues that may not  be  specific  to  the  project  could  complicate  consensus making. \nCommercial  arrangements  between  governments  are  often  dictated  more  by  political  than \neconomic  considerations.  In  contrast,  in  the  case  of  the  Regional  Power  Transmission \nProject  between  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan,  the  signing  of  the  power  trade  agreement  did \nnot  face  much  political  complexity  because  Afghanistan  does  not  share  the  problems \nspecific  to  the  Former  Soviet  Union  and  is  heavily  supported  by  donor  assistance  in \ninstitutions  and  regulatory  aspects  as  well.  This  underscores  the  importance  of  putting \nproject  analysis  in  a  proper  institutional  and  political  economy  context  and  sequencing \nappropriate forms of interventions in stages. \n\n5.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nMajor recommendations drawn from our review and lessons learned include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nRationale  as  a  cross-border  project  should  be  articulated  during  project \npreparation. This is important when the financing requirement for the project is \nlarge.  An  explicitly  regional  perspective  could  help  in  mobilizing  funds  from  a \nwider circle of donors. \n\nMore time and resources should be allocated to distribution analysis in order to \nclarify the project rationale and mitigate coordination failure, as well as to help \nmobilize  funds.  In  particular,  regional  benefits  beyond  the  sum  of  domestic \nbenefits should be identified and estimated to the extent possible. For projects \nin  the  transport  sector,  the  analysis  done  for  the  CAREC  Regional  Road \nCorridor  Improvement  Project  seems  to  be  a  good  start  (see  Table  3  for  an \nillustration).  For  projects  in  the  energy  sector,  the  analysis  done  for  the  Nam \nTheun  2  Hydroelectric  Project  seems  to  be  a  good  start  (see  Table  4  for  an \nillustration).  Even  when  a  project  is  located  within  a  single  country,  showing \nadditional cross-border benefits accruing to neighbor countries would enhance \ninter-country cooperation and promote better alignment of national and regional \ndevelopment  goals.  A  properly  prepared  distribution  analysis  can  help  adjust \nproject  design  for  a  win-win  outcome.  Detailed  distribution  analysis  by \ndisaggregated stakeholders across is desired, as illustrated in Appendix 4. \n\ninvolved \n\nCompleting  different  sections  of  a  transport  corridor  in  a  timely  manner  is \nimportant  in  assuring  maximum  developmental  impact. When  different  donors \nare \ntransport  corridor,  careful \ncoordination  is  required.  The  number  of  donors  involved  and  associated \nuncertainties should be minimized.

For example, transport projects should collect the \nfollowing  categories  of  baseline  information:  (i) traffic  count  by  vehicle  type, \norigin,  and  destination;  (ii) freight  movements  by  type  of  freight,  origin,  and \ndestination  (through  a  survey  of  freight  forwarders);  and  (iii) trade  impact  (by \ngathering time series customs data on major commodities being moved along \ncorridors).  In  order  to  mitigate  resource  constraints  on  the  part  of  developing \ncountries,  donors  could  attach  to  project  support  piggy-backed  technical \nassistance  specific  to  evaluation  purposes  for  selected  projects  aiming  at \ncollecting  baseline  data and  monitoring  critical  cross-border  impact  indicators. \nFor positive externalities, such indicators could include trade and investment as \nwell  as  household  income  along  the  economic  corridors.  For  negative \nexternalities,  indicators  could  include  incidence  of  infectious  diseases,  human \ntrafficking, and forest areas cleared. \n\nIn  complementing  physical  construction  of  transport  corridors,  the  necessary \nregulatory aspects of cross-border trade, especially transit trade, should be put \nin  place  as  early  as  possible.  For  example,  a  region-wide  standard  similar  to \nthe  Transport  International  Routier  Convention  should  be  put  in  place  along \nwith cross-border transport agreements, as suggested by Banomyong (2007). \n\nPreventive  and  mitigation  measures  should  be  prepared  against  some  of  the \neasily  predictable  and  potentially  large  negative  impacts  of  cross-border \ntransport  projects.  For  example, \nthe  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road \nRehabilitation  (Phase  II)  Project  includes  a  grant-financed  component  on \nHIV/AIDS  and  migration  to  support  Tajikistan\u2019s  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s  National \nHIV/AIDS  Center  in  developing  an  integrated,  community-based,  gender-\nresponsive  approach  to  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  diseases.

Sandler (2004) provides a useful framework in this regard (see Table A.1.1). The \n\u201caggregation technology\u201d reflects divisibility and appropriability of the services deriving from \nthe  RPGs,  which  in  turn  determines  individual  members\u2019  free-riding  incentives,  which  then \ndetermines the level of coordination failure in RPG provision.  \n\nTable A.1.1: Regional Public Goods: Typology and Examples \n\n \n\nAggregate Level of \nRPG Determined by: \nSummation: sum of  \ncountries\u2019 contributions \n\nWeighted sum: differentially \nweighted sum of countries\u2019 \ncontributions \nWeakest link: smallest  \ncontribution  \n\nWeaker link: smallest  \ncontribution, followed by  \nthe second smallest  \ncontribution, and so on \nBest shot: largest  \ncontribution \n\nBetter shot: largest  \ncontribution, followed by \nthe second largest  \ncontribution, and so on \n\nPure \nPublic Good \nCleaning a lake \n\nCurbing spread \nof AIDS \n\nImplementing \ninternational \nstandards for  \nfinancial practices \nForestalling spread \nof \nan agricultural  \npest \n\nCuring a disease \n\nDiscovering  \neffective  \ntreatment \n\nImpure \nPublic Good \nTreatment of \nHIV/AIDS  \npatients \nReducing  \nacid rain \n\nSurveillance of \ndisease  \noutbreaks \n\nClub Good \n\nJoint Products \n\nTransnational  \npark \n\nPreserving \nrainforests \n\nPower grid \n\nAirport  \nhub-spoke network \n\nEliminating \ntransnational \nterrorist threat \nPrevention and  \nmitigation of  \nnatural disasters \n\nMaintenance \nof sterilization \n\nTransport \ninfrastructure \n\nInternet \nconnectivity \n\nAgricultural \nresearch \nfindings  \nUncovering \nintelligence \non political  \ninstabilities \n\nSatellite \nlaunch facility \n\nRegional \npeacekeeping \n\nBiohazard  \nfacility \n\nBio-prospecting \n\nSource: Sandler (2004: 21, Table 1.1). \n\nIn terms of the conventional characterization of public goods (the columns in Table A.1.1)\u2014\nnon-rivalry of benefits and excludability of non-payers\u2014almost all cross-border infrastructure \nprojects  would  fall  within  the  club  good  category  (Internet  connectivity  is  categorized  as  a \n\u201cjoint  product\u201d  in  that  it  provides  network  externality  as  well  as  commercial  user-specific \nbenefits  of  a  club  nature).  In  principle,  club  goods  can  be  efficiently  provided  through \nappropriate  user  charges  such  as  differential  tolls  based  on  revealed  road  use,  but  equity \nconcerns remain. For example, smaller members with less financial and institutional capacity \nmight require cross-subsidization within the club or subsidy by external donors. \n\nIn  terms  of  the  supply  characteristics  (the  rows  in  Table A.1.1),  however,  there  exist \ndifferences  in  the  optimal  way  of  intervention  by  regional  development  institutions  such  as \nADB.  For  example,  a  power  grid  falls  within  the  weighted  sum  technology  in  which  the \noverall level of regional power service is determined by a differentially weighted sum of the \ncountries\u2019  contributions.  National  governments  or  private  sector  players  would  have  an \nincentive  to  finance  such  infrastructure  in  \u201chigher-weight\u201d  portions  of  the  grid  (e.g., \ntopographically easier to build; large power surplus-deficit gap across borders) while \u201clower-\nweight\u201d  portions  might  require  financing  by  external  donors.  Furthermore,  the  technical \nnature of power grids requires that all portions of the network adopt the same standards and \n\n \n\n32 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nregulations  for  maximizing  its  services.  External  donors  have  a  role  in  coordinating  this \naspect  as  well  as  supporting capacity  building for  institutionally  weak  members,  preventing \npotentially  unfair  contracts  and  pricing  between  the  countries  exporting  and  importing  the \npower, and assisting in dispute resolution. \n\nTransport infrastructure projects would fall within either the weakest link technology, in which \nthe  smallest  contribution  fixes  the  effective  aggregate  supply  level  for  the  entire  region,  or \nthe weaker link, in which smaller contributions determine the aggregate level. An example of \nthe weakest link would be the least well-functioning transport infrastructure (or missing link) \nthat  may  determine  the  reliability  of  the  whole  regional  transport  system  (e.g.,  the \nCambodian portion of the Pan-Asia Railway connecting Singapore to Beijing). An example of \nthe weaker link would be portions of road networks that are located in landlocked countries \n(Lao PDR, Bhutan, Nepal, Central Asian republics). It seems that private sector players had \ninadequate  incentive  to finance  transport  infrastructure  in  these  portions precisely  because \nthey are the weaker or weakest link, partly due to difficult geographical conditions and partly \ndue  to  inadequate  capacity  of the governments.  Therefore, these  links  have  a  strong  case \nfor public support by external donors in financing the physical infrastructure and associated \ninstitutional  and  regulatory  arrangements,  such  as  cross-border  trade  agreements,  as  well \nas capacity building of the institutionally weak members. \n\nIn  addition  to  capacity  building  support  for  weak  members,  donor  support  to  repeated \ninteractions  among  club  members  also  helps  alleviate  coordination  failure.  Bringing \ngovernment officials together on a regular basis, while it would consume resources without \nconcrete results in the beginning, would allow members to learn one another\u2019s preferences \nand concerns, thus reducing asymmetric information, as pointed out in Sandler (2004). \n\n \n\n33 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nAPPENDIX 2: DYNAMICS OF AGGLOMERATION AND \nDISPERSION \n\nTwo opposing economic forces work in the formation of economic nodes across borders \nwith development of cross-border infrastructure. Table A.2.1 provides examples of such \nopposing forces. Initially, as centripetal forces dominate centrifugal forces, a few large \neconomic nodes will be formed along regional transport corridors, leading to widening \ndisparity. Then, as centrifugal forces dominate centripetal forces over time, economic \nactivities will disperse and more small and medium-sized nodes will be formed, leading to \nshrinking disparity. \n\nTable A.2.1: Causes of Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces \n\nCentripetal Forces across Borders \n- \nIncreasing returns in production \n-  Pecuniary externalities through     \nbackward and forward linkages \n-  Network externalities in consumption \n-  Knowledge spillovers and other  \n\npositive externalities \n\n- \n\nCentrifugal Forces across Borders \nImmobile  factors  (land  and,  in  some \ncases, labor) \n\n-  Rise in factor prices/commuting cost \n-  Congestion/pollution and other  \n\nnegative externalities \n\nSource: Adapted from Fujita, Krugman, and Venables (1999: 346). \n\nFigure  A.2.1  illustrates  such  dynamics.  Connectivity  cost  here  broadly  refers  to  all  costs \ninvolved in private sector entities (e.g., manufacturers, traders, forwarders, tour operators) in \nlinking their businesses across borders toward becoming seamless. It covers costs including \ntransport  costs,  waiting  time  at  borders,  tariffs,  customs  procedures,  and  necessary \ntelecommunications. In  the  new  economic geography  literature,  these  are  often  collectively \nreferred  to  as  \u201cservice  link  cost,\u201d  a  concept  similar  to  \u201ctransaction  costs\u201d  used  in \nmicroeconomics. It is conceivable that as the connectivity cost decreases over time, initially \ndiverse economies in developmental stages and resource endowments will form the kind of \nsequential positive externalities that first go to a few of the existing nodes disproportionately, \nand  then  subsequently  go  to  a  large  number  of  new  nodes  ,  leading  to  a  win-win  long-run \noutcome.  This  line  of  scenario  can  be  simulated  using  a  \u201cgeographical  equilibrium\u201d  model. \nFor  example,  a  simulation  by  ERIA  (2008)  yielded  a  preliminary  result  in  which,  holding \nmacroeconomic and demographic characteristics constant, improvement in transport speed \nand  time  along  the  East\u2013West  Corridor,  for  example,  leads  eventually  to  dispersion  of \npopulation and economic value added along the route between Bangkok and Hanoi. \n\nWhile  this  scenario  is  plausible  in  generally  illustrating  how  cross-border  infrastructure \nprojects  impact  the  participating  economies,  the  benefit-cost  distribution  \u201cprofile\u201d  over  time \n(in the lower half of Figure A.2.1) is influenced by complementary investments. For example, \ntransit  countries  along  economic  corridors  are  well  positioned  to  accelerate  the  centrifugal \nforce for dispersion (i.e., condensing the curve horizontally in the upper half of Figure A.2.1) \nby  setting  up  facilities  such  as  special  economic  zones,  industrial  estates,  and  distribution \ncenters in order to attract intra- and extra-regional foreign direct investment inflows. Various \ndonors  could  join  in  providing  analytical  and  financial  assistance  in  this  regard.  Doing  so \nwould contribute to a successful formulation of cross-border infrastructure projects and their \nsustainability.  \n\nIn fact, the concept of economic corridor borrows from the regional growth triangle paradigm. \nThis  paradigm  refers  to  economic  zones  spread  over  relatively  large  but  well-defined, \ngeographically  adjacent  areas  in  which  differences  in  the  factor  endowments  of  three  or \nmore countries are exploited so as to promote growth, external trade, and direct investment. \nAn  economic  corridor consists  of  several  elements:  a  defined  location;  economic  activities, \nphysical infrastructure including an economic and transport system around which economic \n\n \n\n34 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nactivities can be clustered, and soft infrastructure (including foreign investment regulations, \nincentives,  and  institutions)  (ADB  1999).  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  anticipate  these \nelements in planning cross-border infrastructure investments, and their development should \nbe monitored and evaluated. \n\nAs transport costs decline, immediate supply responses are mostly domestic, such as new \nservice establishments along the road. In order to achieve broad development impact such \nas increased cross-border trade and foreign direct investment, complementary interventions \nare  needed  such  as  special  economic  zones,  investment  incentives,  and simplification  and \nharmonization of border-crossing procedures. \n\nFigure A.2.1: Dynamics of Agglomeration and Dispersion due to Cross-Border \nInfrastructure Development \n\nAgglomeration \n\nCentrifugal > Centripetal  \n\nCentripetal > Centrifugal  \n\nConnectivity cost \n\nDispersion \n\nTotal external \nbenefits \n\nBenefits going to many \nnew smaller nodes \n\nBenefits going to existing \nfew large nodes \n\nTime with connectivity \ncost reduction \n\n \n\nSource: Authors; discussion with Peter Rimmer. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nAPPENDIX 3: LIST OF THE PROJECTS REVIEWED \n\nLoan Approval \n\nProject Completion  ADB\u2019s Post \nEvaluation \n\nNov 2007 \n\nAug 1995 \nDec 1998 \n\nMay 1999 \nNov 1999 \nDec 2002 \nNov 2002 \nNov 2006 \nNov 2006 \n\nProject Name  \n(Borrower Country) \nGMS \n1.

With the expected \nbridge construction over the Mekong River (to be completed by 2011), this road completes \nthe  Bangkok\u2013Kunming  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \nprogram. In  the  project appraisal  carried  out  in  2002,  the  project\u2019s  economic  benefits  were \ncalculated  based  on  the  direct  savings  in  estimated  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOC) \nassociated  with  normal  (or  existing)  traffic,  generated  traffic,  and  diverted  traffic  (from  the \nriver).  The  appraisal  did  not  attempt  to  quantify  indirect  benefits  through  induced  trade, \ninvestments, and new employment opportunities. The project costs considered consisted of \ncivil  works,  project  management  and  supervision,  resettlement  costs,  environmental \nmanagement  plans,  administrative  costs,  and  recurring  maintenance  costs.  Valuation  of \nbenefits and costs was based on an anticipated project life of 30 years and an ADB-standard \nrate of 12% was used to discount them to the present values in 2002 prices. The appraisal \nassumed  workers  for  the  road  construction  would  be  drawn  from  the  project  area  and  that \nthe opportunity cost of labor for the project workers was equal to the prevailing local market \nwage rate (i.e., that there was no surplus labor in the project area). Therefore, there were no \nnet direct benefits to laborers working on the project. Table A.4.1 illustrates the benefit-cost \ndistribution based on these assumptions.  \n\nWhile  the  analysis  indicates  an  overall  positive  outcome  of  the  project,  a  disproportionate \nshare  of  the  benefits  from  saved  VOC,  particularly  associated  with  diverted  traffic,  were \nprojected  to  accrue to Thai  and  PRC  stakeholders. This follows  from the fact that the  road \nwould improve the transport link between these two larger economies and the majority of the \ndiverted  traffic  on  the  road  was  expected  to  involve  stakeholders  based  in  the  PRC  and \nThailand.  However,  two  compensation  mechanisms  assumed  in  the  project  arrangement \nmake  up  for  the  otherwise  unfavorable  distributional  outcome  for  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR). The first is the transit fee to be collected by the Lao PDR \ngovernment from the road users including those originating from Thailand and the PRC. The \nsecond  is  the  concessional  loans  (net  financial  transfer  due  to  the  favorable  terms  of \ngovernment  loans  compared  with  commercial  loans)  provided  by  the  Thai  and  PRC \ngovernments to the Lao PDR government (captured in the \u201cFinance\u201d row in the table). These \narrangements  would  counter  potential  unfavorable  social  and  environmental  effects  that \nwould mainly accrue to stakeholders in the Lao PDR and help ensure a win-win outcome of \nthe investment in the project road. \n\nIn addition to direct impacts on VOC and project investment costs, attempts should be made \nto capture wider impacts through changes in trade, investment, and tourist flows, as well as \nanticipated  social  and  environmental  effects. While  not  all  of these  effects  are quantifiable, \nthey  could  be  more  substantial  than  what  the  conventional  analysis  could  capture.  Table \nA.4.1 illustrates the ranges of effects that could be covered. Conventional analysis captures \nmainly direct effects in the first four rows: concessional finance, construction and operation \nand maintenance, changes in traffic, and saved transport cost. The rest of the effects are of \nan  indirect  and  long-run  nature.  Depending  on  data  availability  (e.g.,  time-series  local \ncustoms  data,  disaggregated  household  survey  data)  and  feasibility  of  stakeholder \ninterviews, some of these effects could be analyzed and projected in a coherent way, e.g., \nusing  models  for  regional  markets  of  representative  traded  goods  that  are  transported \nincreasingly due to the project. \n\n \n\n37 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 226 \n \n\n \n\nFujimura and Adhikari \n\nTable A.4.1: Economic Analysis of the Northern Economic Corridor Project \n\nLao PDR \n\nThailand \n\nPRC \n\nBenefit / \nCost Item \n\nNet \nBenefit \nby Item \n\nSaved VOCa \nNormal   \ntraffic \n\nGenerated \ntraffic  \n\nDiverted \ntraffic \n\nTransit fee \nConstruction \ncosts \n\n \n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\no\np\nr\no\nC\n\n \nr\ne\nm\nu\ns\nn\no\nC\n\n \n\nb\n\n \nr\no\nb\na\nL\n \n\n \n\n \nf\no\n \nt\ns\ne\nR\n\n \n/\nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\nG\n \n\n \n\nc\n\n \ny\nm\no\nn\no\nc\nE\n \n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\no\np\nr\no\nC\n\n \nr\ne\nm\nu\ns\nn\no\nC\n\n \n\nb\n\n \nr\no\nb\na\nL\n \n\n \n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\no\np\nr\no\nC\n \n\n \nr\ne\nm\nu\ns\nn\no\nC\n\n \n\nb\n\n \nr\no\nb\na\nL\n\n \n\u2014 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40.10 \n\n6.66 \n\n9.05 \n\n6.23 \n\n13.26 \n\n0.95 \n\n0.78 \n\n1.42  0.97 \n\n12.21 \n\n6.64 \n\n0.87 \n\n2.21 \n\n0.59 \n\n0.18 \n\n0.40 \n\n0.63  0.21 \n\n33.92  \u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n4.04 \n\n7.10 \n\n5.82 \n\n4.04  7.10 \n\n30.2 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014  \u2014 \n\n30.2  \u2014 \n\n\u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n\n\u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n\n \nf\no\n \nt\ns\ne\nR\n\n \n/\nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\nG\n \n\n \n\nc\n\n \ny\nm\no\nn\no\nc\nE\n \n\n0.78 \n\n0.48 \n\n5.82 \n\n \nf\no\n \nt\ns\ne\nR\n\n \n/\nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\nG\n \n \n\n \n\nc\n\n \ny\nm\no\nn\no\nc\nE\n\n \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014  \u2014 \n\n\u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n\n\u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n\n\u20137.3 \n\u201320.8 \n\u201313.5 \n\u201310.4 \n\u20137.6 \n0 \n56.83 \n56.83 \n(100) \n\n Labor \n Equipment \n Material \n Other \n O&M \nFinance d \nNet benefits \nBy country \n(Share %) \nADB = Asian Development Bank; Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; O&M = operations and \nmaintenance; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; VOC = vehicle operation cost. \na \n\n\u20137.3 \n\u201320.8 \n\u201313.5 \n\u201310.4 \n\u20137.6 \n34.6  \u2014 \n13.64 \n\n\u201317.3  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n\u201310.3  6.09  8.28  \u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n13.30 \n36.86 \n(64.9) \n\n\u2014  \u2014 \n9.92  \u2014 \n\n\u2014  \u2014 \n8.23  \u2014 \n\n17.89 \n15.82 \n(27.8) \n\n4.15 \n(7.3) \n\n\u201317.3 \n\u201310.2 \n\nb \n\nSavings  on  vehicle  operation cost  are  estimated based on projected  traffic  growth  and  the  operating costs  by \nvehicle type (various sizes of buses and trucks). \nTo the extent that the project labor is drawn from \u201csurplus\u201d labor whose opportunity cost is lower than the paid \nwage  rate,  the  project  labor  would  have  positive  benefits.
