Close to 15 million \npeople in the region are employed in these professions, accounting for about 5% of total employment. \nUsing the application rates for professional recognition and mobility in the European Union as a proxy, \napproximately 20,920 professionals might apply annually for recognition under the ASEAN MRA system. \n\nThe ASEAN goal of encouraging intraregional mobility must be understood in the context of changing \npopulation dynamics, rising educational levels and aspirations, and increasingly dynamic\u2014if complex\u2014\neconomic forces. These so-called megaforces are poised to transform the supply, demand, and mobility of \nskilled professionals across ASEAN: \n\n \u0242 Diverging demographics. ASEAN represents a demographically diverse region. Some countries, such \nas Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, and Thailand, are projected to see their labor forces age and decline, \nresulting in a growing elderly population and a narrowing worker pipeline. By contrast, Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and the Philippines might continue to \nsee their labor forces grow over the next couple of decades. Taken together, these complementary \npressures are likely to encourage people of working age\u2014including the highly educated\u2014to move \nwithin the region.\n\n \u0242 Rising educational levels and aspirations. The changing skill and education levels of the population \nin the region will also affect the size and composition of migrant flows. In the past few decades, all \nASEAN countries have made large investments in secondary and tertiary education. Larger cohorts \nof ASEAN citizens with a vocational or college education mean a greater pool of skilled workers who \nare likely to migrate, given the right incentives. In addition, more students from ASEAN countries are \nseeking an international education. Unlike in the past, when a lack of education opportunities at home \ndrew many to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the \neducational aspirations of the new generation of students can be met regionally. \n\nvii\n\n\fviii\n\nexecutive summary\n\n \u0242 Continuing economic disparities and opportunities. Wide variation in economic opportunities in \nthe region has been and will remain the key driving force for migration across the skills continuum. The \n2007\u20132013 Gallup World Poll1 highlights two important observations about the mobility aspirations \nof skilled persons worldwide: they are almost twice as likely to intend to emigrate (19%) than those in \nlow-skilled occupations (10%), and they are more likely to have the means to do so. As rapid economic \ngrowth increases regional demand for the highly skilled, ASEAN Member States need to commit the \nnecessary capital and policy investments to attracting and retaining ever-larger shares of well-qualified \nworkers in the region.\n\nThe convergence of these megatrends represents unique opportunities for human capital development and \nbrain circulation within Southeast Asia. For low-income countries, such as Lao PDR, even a small increase \nin the absolute number of high-skilled foreigners can raise the number of needed professionals and expand \naccess to critical services. For middle-income countries, such as Malaysia, a greater number of highly skilled \nworkers might propel the nation toward becoming a high-income economy and thus avoid the middle-income \ntrap. Finally, the wealthiest ASEAN countries, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore, would benefit from tapping \nskilled regional talent to compensate for a declining labor supply and to sustain economic vitality and growth. \n\nThe promise of greater brain circulation depends on a proactive regional response to two pressing challenges: \nbrain waste and brain drain. \n\n \u0242 Brain waste is an understudied issue in ASEAN. More formally known as \u201cskills underutilization,\u201d \nbrain waste typically refers to persons working in jobs for which their education and work experience \noverqualify them. A classic case of brain waste is an experienced doctor or engineer driving a taxi. This \nsituation represents the worst of public policy outcomes: the human capital that newcomers bring \ninto a country slowly degrades, the destination country fails to harness their skills and talents, and the \ninvestments all parties have made are wasted.  \n \nWhile skills underutilization can be observed throughout the developed world, there is a lack of relevant \ndata or studies about it in the ASEAN context. For the most part, the phenomenon has been off the \nradar of regional policymakers. \n\n \u0242 Brain drain is a source of ongoing concern in ASEAN. Brain drain, or the emigration of highly \n\neducated individuals, has been recognized as a significant obstacle to economic and social development. \nSpecifically, the number of tertiary-educated ASEAN emigrants in OECD countries increased from \n1.7 million in 2000 to 2.8 million in 2010\u201311. The motivation to emigrate to OECD countries remains \nstrong: a powerful base of jobs and support networks makes it likely that skilled emigration from ASEAN \nto OECD will continue. \n \n\n1  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Connecting with Emigrants: A Global Profile of Diasporas 2015 (Paris: OECD \n\nPublishing, 2015), www.oecd.org/publications/connecting-with-emigrants-9789264239845-en.htm. \n\n\fexecutive summary\n\nix\n\nThere are opportunities to compensate for some of the negative effects of such emigration. In a globally \nconnected world, the departure of skilled nationals is neither necessarily permanent nor a net drain, \nat least in the long run. Many return with new skills, financial and social capital, and access to valuable \nbusiness and educational networks. Further, successful migrants abroad can \u201cact as social, cultural, and \neconomic ambassadors.\u201d2 Finally, remittances received from abroad can not only improve the economic \nfortunes of migrants\u2019 families but also support productive investments. \n\nDespite legitimate concerns about brain waste and brain drain, the prospects of more dynamic brain circulation \nwithin the Southeast Asia region, with associated benefits, remain good. \n\n \u0242 The regional brain network is expanding. Until now, most intra-ASEAN migrants have been low-\n\nskilled, temporary, and unauthorized. Today, the share of high-skilled regional migration is on the rise, \nfueled in large part by university students. Furthermore, a growing share of skilled persons are moving to \nother ASEAN countries (and not outside the region), including to those with income levels below Brunei \nDarussalam and Singapore. \n\n \u0242 Brain circulation is encouraged by a number of important developments. Three such \n\ndevelopments are particularly relevant: First, there is growing awareness that foreign professionals \nplay an important role in regional economic growth. Second, the ASEAN educational infrastructure is \nexpanding at rates that support the growth of student mobility in the region. Third, efforts to mutually \nrecognize professional qualifications are beginning to bear fruit. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of sweeping changes in the scale, composition, and direction of intraregional flows, \nASEAN is on the threshold of substantially expanding the regional mobility of the highly skilled. However, \nprogress could stall unless ASEAN Member States fully understand and address a number of challenges at \nboth the regional and national levels. \n\n \u0242 At the regional level, it is essential to improve data collection and make progress on the \n\nimplementation of signed MRAs. Lack of consistent, harmonized data across ASEAN countries \nand across the MRA-covered professions makes it difficult to track and influence skilled mobility and \nto counter brain drain and brain waste. Models of how to address these data needs and gaps exist in \nother countries and regions.3 The international development community could be asked to support an \nASEAN-level data-collection effort.  \n \n\n2  Demetrios G. Papademetriou, Rethinking Emigration: Turning Challenges into Opportunities (Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute, 2015),  \n\n3 \n\nwww.migrationpolicy.org/research/rethinking-emigration-turning-challenges-opportunities-transatlantic-council-statement. \nThe OECD\u2019s annual publication, International Migration Outlook, is one such example. See OECD, International Migration Outlook 2016 (Paris: OECD \nPublishing, 2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/migr_outlook-2016-en. \n\n\fx\n\nexecutive summary\n\nTo date, implementation of the MRAs has been slowed by many technical and institutional hurdles. \nWhile addressing these barriers, ASEAN policymakers would do well to think ahead about the next \ngeneration of arrangements covering other occupations the region may need, such as those for teachers \nand construction professionals. \n\n \u0242 At the national level, ASEAN Member States must deepen understanding of brain waste and \n\nbrain drain. This can be done by producing better data and involving a diverse range of stakeholders\u2014\nemployers, professional associations, government and regulatory authorities, education institutions, \nservice providers, and the general public\u2014in finding solutions. The reason to do so is both simple and \ncompelling: Given evident changes in the scale, composition, and direction of intraregional flows, all \nASEAN Member States will eventually be both origin and destination countries for skilled migrants. \nTherefore, challenges such as brain waste and brain drain will increasingly be relevant for all countries.  \n\n\fi.  introduction\n\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations \n\n(ASEAN) Member States are in the \nmidst of a historic economic, social, and \ndemographic transformation4 powered by rising \nlevels of education, a youthful population, more \ntransparent government, ever-stronger social and \npolitical institutions, and cross-border migrant \nflows that have more than tripled since 1990, \nreaching 9.9 million by 2015.5 A small but rising \nnumber of these migrants are highly skilled.6 Valued \nfor their education, international experience, and \ntransnational networks, these skilled migrants are \nbeing recognized by policymakers, employers, and \nother stakeholders as key potential contributors \nto the national and regional economic growth \ngoals at the heart of the recently launched \nASEAN Economic Community (AEC). \n\nTo capitalize on the human capital the region has \nbeen developing, leaders of the ASEAN Member \nStates included the free flow of skilled labor as a \ncore element of the AEC Blueprint, on par with \nthe free flow of services, goods, investment, and \ncapital. In order to promote intraregional skill \nmobility, the 10\u00a0ASEAN countries have agreed to \n\nmutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) for seven \nprofessions.7 Based on a wide range of data sources, \nthis report estimates that workers in these professions \naccount for approximately 5% of the 310.6 million \nemployed persons in ASEAN. In absolute terms, \nemployment in the seven MRA-covered professions \ntotals 14.9 million workers, of which 83% (or 12.5 \nmillion) are in the tourism sector (see Figure 1).\n\nIn addition to MRAs, the 10 countries also agreed \nto develop an ASEAN Qualification Reference \nFramework (AQRF),8 facilitate the issuing of \ntemporary visas, and encourage the mobility \nof university students and academic staff by \nstrengthening education-related regional initiatives.9\n\nWhile skill mobility is a core element of the AEC, \nits realization on the ground has been difficult. This \nreport explores the opportunities and challenges in \nfreeing the flow of skilled labor in the ASEAN region. \nIt aims to offer the most recent evidence and data to \nhelp policymakers gain a better picture of trends in \nthe movement of skilled persons and achieve a more \nnuanced understanding of the forces that are likely to \nshape skilled mobility in the future. \n\n4  Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century \n\n7 \n\n(Manila: ADB, 2011),  \nwww.adb.org/publications/asia-2050-realizing-asian-century. \n\n5  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs \n\n(UNDESA), Population Division, \u201cInternational Migrant Stock: The \n2015 Revision\u201d (United Nations database, POP/DB/MIG/Stock/\nRev.2015, accessed 1 May 2016),  \nwww.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/\nestimates2/index.shtml. \nIn this report, unless stated otherwise, the terms \u201chighly skilled,\u201d \u201chighly \neducated,\u201d and \u201ctertiary educated\u201d are used interchangeably and refer \nto adults with a tertiary-level education. \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n6 \n\nBetween 2005 and 2014, Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) countries signed Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) for \nengineering (2005), nursing (2006), architecture (2007), medicine and \ndentistry (2009), tourism professionals (2012), and accounting (2014). \nA framework arrangement on MRAs in surveying was also signed in 2007.\nThe main goal of the ASEAN Qualification Reference Framework \n(AQRF) is to provide a comprehensive benchmark for current national \nqualification frameworks and to enable meaningful comparison of \nqualifications across ASEAN countries. \nPonciano Intal, Jr. et al., ASEAN Rising: ASEAN and AEC Beyond 2015 \n(Jakarta: Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia, \n2014), www.eria.org/publications/key_reports/ASEAN-Rising.html. \n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\nFigure 1: asean employment:  \ntotal and in Mutual recognition arrangement-Covered professions\n\nTotal Employment:\n310,582,000\n\nEmployed in MRA-Covered Professions:\n14,940,000\n\n5%\n\nTourism\n83% \n\nNursing\n8% \n\nEngineering\n3% \nMedical\n2% \n\nAccounting\n1% \nDentistry\n1% \n\nArchitecture\n<1% \n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, MRA = Mutual Recognition Arrangement.\nNote: Employment by individual profession is shown as a percentage of the 14.9 million employed in the seven MRA-covered professions.\nSource: Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates, based on various data sources.

The project aims to improve understanding of the barriers to the free movement \nof professionals within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region and to support the development of \nstrategies to overcome these hurdles. \n\nThe reports in this series draw on the insights of 387 regional and international experts and practitioners through their \nparticipation in focus group discussions, meetings, and surveys. Contributors include ASEAN Member State officials directly \nresponsible for Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) implementation, as well as private-sector employers, academics, \ntraining directors, MRA monitoring committee members, and current and former ASEAN Secretariat officials. \n\nADB and MPI convened 12 days of focus group discussions and meetings between May and September 2015 that were \nattended by more than 100 regional stakeholders. See the Appendixes of this report for more on the methodology of the \nstudy and for a complete list of stakeholders involved.\n\n\fii.  human Capital Development  \nand mobility: The impact of megatrends  \n\nThe 10 ASEAN countries represent a continuum \n\nof economic and social development. Brunei \nDarussalam and Singapore are the most \ndeveloped; Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, and Viet Nam \n(CLMV) are the least developed; and Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines fall in \nbetween. Each, in turn, is differently affected by \nthe dynamic megatrends at work in the region. This \nsection examines the demographic, labor force, \neconomic, and social changes that affect the supply \nand mobility of skilled workers. These important \ntrends will then be revisited later, in a discussion of \nhow they are related to brain drain and brain waste in \nASEAN countries and how they are driving the growth \nand diversification of migrant flows in the region.\n\na.  Demographic trends:  \n\nreduced Fertility and increased  \nlife expectancy\n\nPopulation change remains a key driving force \nof economic growth and social development. \nCountry-by-country differences aside, all ASEAN \ncountries have experienced a powerful demographic \ntransformation since the 1970s.10 Two forces are \nreshaping the age structure of the region\u2019s population \ntoday: reduced fertility and increased life expectancy. \n\nThe size of the ASEAN population has almost tripled, \nfrom 228 million in 1970 to 622 million in 2014. This \ngrowth has been driven by Indonesia, the Philippines, \n\n10  Graeme Hugo, \u201cEmerging Demographic Trends in Asia and the \nPacific: The Implications for International Migration,\u201d in Talent, \nCompetitiveness, and Migration, eds. Bertelsmann Stiftung and the \nMigration Policy Institute (MPI) (G\u00fctersloh, Germany and Washington, \nDC: Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung and MPI, 2009).\n\nand Viet Nam. However, the annual growth rate of \nthe ASEAN population in 2014 (1.2%) was just about \nhalf of what it was in 1970 (2.2%).11 In fact, all ASEAN \nMember States are experiencing fertility declines. In \n2013, the total fertility rate (i.e., the average number \nof children a woman would potentially have) in the \nthree most populous ASEAN countries was as follows: \n2.4 in Indonesia, 3.1 in the Philippines, and 1.8 in Viet \nNam\u2014roughly half of their respective rates in 1970. \nFertility rates in Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam \nare much lower than the replacement fertility rate12 \nof 2.1 children per woman, while the rate in Brunei \nDarussalam and Myanmar (2.0) barely approaches it.13 \n\nWhile fewer children are being born today than \na few decades ago, people live longer as a result \nof improved living standards and better access to \nhealth care. Life expectancy has thus increased, \nthough again with significant variation across the \nregion\u2014ranging from high in Singapore (83 years); \nto mid-level in Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam \n(73\u201374\u00a0years); to low in Lao PDR (66 years).14 \n\nThese demographic changes carry significant \nimplications for ASEAN country labor forces. While \nthe populations of all Member States are aging, \ninternal demographic dynamics differ. The region can \nbe divided into two groups, based on differences in \nlabor force supply and demand projections. \n\n11  ASEAN, \u201cSelected Basic ASEAN Indicators\u201d (dataset, ASEAN \n\nSecretariat, August 2015),  \nwww.asean.org/storage/2015/09/selected_key_indicators/table1_\nas_of_Aug_2015.xls \n\n12  Refers to the level of fertility at which a population replaces itself from \none generation to the next. The impact of migration is not factored in. \n13  ASEAN, Statistical Yearbook 2014 (Jakarta: ASEAN Secretariat, 2015), \nwww.asean.org/storage/images/2015/July/ASEAN-Yearbook/\nJuly%202015%20-%20ASEAN%20Statistical%20Yearbook%202014.pdf\nIbid.\n\n14 \n\n4\n\n\fhuman-Capital Development and mobility\n\n5\n\nCambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines represent \nthe first group. In these countries, the rapid shift from \nhigh to low fertility has generated what demographers \ncall a youth bulge, a large cohort of adults aged \n15\u201324. For instance, about 40% of Indonesia\u2019s \npopulation is under the age of 25, and just 14% is 55 \nor older.15 Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines \nalso have largely youthful populations with relatively \nsmall shares of elderly. As the youth bulge moves \nthrough the working-age pipeline, it will contribute \nto domestic economic growth, especially if adequate \nhuman capital development policies are in place. \n\nThe second country cluster includes Brunei \nDarussalam, Singapore, and Thailand. These \ncountries have begun experiencing a classic \ndemographic double squeeze: an aging population \nwith longer life expectancy, coupled with low fertility \nrates, squeezes the supply of the working-age \npopulation from both ends. For example, in Singapore \njust 30% of the population is under age 25, and 20% \nof the population is 55 or older. Brunei Darussalam \nand Thailand have similar demographics.16 As a result, \nthese three countries already face labor shortages. \nThey will need to bolster labor productivity by \nconstantly improving the skill levels of their domestic \nlabor force through lifelong education and training. \nAn increasingly robust health-care infrastructure \nis also needed. But even these factors may not be \nenough to compensate for a shrinking labor force, \nleaving it necessary to tap into intraregional and \ninternational talent.\n\nSocial Affairs (UNDESA),17 Thailand and Singapore \nwill experience negative working-age population \ngrowth between 2015 and 2035 (\u201312% and \u20132%, \nrespectively). Other Member States will see positive, \nalbeit slower growth in their working-age populations, \nranging from about 10% in Viet Nam to about \n45% in Lao PDR. UNDESA also projects that the \npopulations of Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and \nthe Philippines will expand across all age groups for \ndecades to come.\n\nThese differing demographic and labor force trends \nplace varying pressures on ASEAN countries. \nSustained population growth in Cambodia, \nIndonesia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines will \ncontinue to expand already large labor forces. Brunei \nDarussalam, Singapore, and Thailand experience \na counterpressure\u2014increasing labor demand that \noutpaces domestic supply. Taken together, these \ndynamics must be addressed at the regional level \nfor a sustainable and regionally beneficial solution. \nInevitably, a regional solution will entail the greater \nmobility of workers across the skills spectrum, \nincluding the highly educated.18 \n\nB.  educational trends: rising levels  \n\nof education\n\nEducational attainment in the region has been \nincreasing over the past few decades, with all \ncountries making great strides in growing the number \nof nationals who attend, and complete, secondary \nand tertiary education.19 \n\nImportantly, these demographic trends will become \neven more pronounced in the future. According to \nthe medium-level fertility scenarios developed by \nthe United Nations Department of Economic and \n\nAs shown in Table 1, college enrollment more \nthan tripled in the region, from 4.6 million in 1990 \nto 15.3\u00a0million in 2011.

In contrast, \nthe agricultural sector accounts for more than \n50% of the Cambodian economy, hence, most \nof its workers are in medium- and low-skilled \noccupations.22 Figure 2 highlights the importance \nof skills by showing a strong, positive relationship \nbetween skills and country development as \nmeasured by the United Nations Human \nDevelopment Index (HDI).23\n\nRegardless of their present national level of \neducation or economic and social development, all \n\nASEAN governments are aware of the importance \nof human capital in promoting and sustaining \neconomic growth and competitiveness.24 This \nunderstanding, in turn, fuels the region\u2019s push \nfor increasing levels of educational attainment. \nMalaysian policymakers, for example, recognize \nthat inadequate educational attainment and skill \nshortages are serious barriers to the country\u2019s \nstrategic vision to become a high-income nation \nby 2020.25 As Box 2 explains, Malaysia has made \nconsiderable progress in addressing skills shortages \nin health care by expanding the number of medical \nand nursing schools.\n\nFigure 2: percentage of workers employed in High-skilled occupations  \nand Human Development index, by Country\n\n \n\nl\n\nd\ne\ny\no\np\nm\nE\n \nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n\ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\np\nu\nc\nc\nO\nd\ne\n\n \n\nl\nl\ni\nk\nS\n-\nh\ng\ni\nH\nn\n\n \n\ni\n\n60 \n\n50 \n\n40 \n\n30 \n\n20 \n\n10 \n\n0 \n\nSingapore\n\nPhilippines\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nMalaysia\n\nCambodia\n\nLao PDR\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\n0 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.5 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.9 \n\n1 \n\nHDI Very High \n\nHDI High \n\nHDI Medium \n\nHuman Development Index \n\nHDI = Human Development Index.\nNotes: Data on the share of high-skilled occupations in Indonesia and Myanmar were unavailable. \nSources: ILO, Analytical Report; United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Human Development Report 2015 (New York: United Nations, \n2015), http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2015_human_development_report_1.pdf\n\n22  The most recently available data on the agricultural sector are from 2012.\n23  The Human Development Index (HDI), developed by the United \n\nNations Development Program (UNDP), reflects a combination of \naverage achievement in key dimensions of human development: a \nlong and healthy life, educational levels, and a decent standard of \nliving.

More recently, \nhowever, the government supported a rapid expansion in the number of medical and nursing schools. Hawthorne reported \nthat by 2014, in addition to the 10 public medical schools in the country, 30 private medical schools had opened and \n20\u00a0more were seeking medical accreditation. This has greatly expanded the domestic supply of health-care professionals, \nincluding in the three occupations covered by ASEAN MRAs. \n\nAs shown in Figure 3, between 2002 and 2011, the number of medical doctors roughly doubled from 17,400 to 36,600, \nand so did the number of nurses (35,300 to 74,800) and dentists (2,300 to 4,250). This rapid increase contributed to the \nexpansion of medical services for the country\u2019s growing population. By 2011, there were 12.6 medical practitioners per \n10,000 people compared to 7.1 in 2002; similarly, the ratio for nurses increased from 14.4 in 2002 to 25.8 in 2011.\n\nThe rapid increase of domestic health-care graduates was accompanied by some challenges, such as a shortage of clinical \ntraining sites and teaching staff, and wide variation in the quality of the education received by new graduates. These and \nother factors prompted a government moratorium on new programs.\n\nSources: Lesleyanne Hawthorne, \u201cOverview and Critical Issues,\u201d in Policy Briefs on the Circular Migration of Health Professionals, ed.

Brunei Darussalam \nand Singapore have wages comparable to those \nin Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) countries (the average monthly \nwage in Singapore is $3,694).28 A second group consists \nof Malaysia ($651 per month), Thailand ($391), and \nthe Philippines ($215). In the third group\u2014Cambodia, \nIndonesia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam\u2014monthly wages \nhover around the mid-to-high $100s.29 \n\nD.   social trends: limited openness  \n\nto Foreigners\n\nAs the pace of skilled mobility picks up in ASEAN, \none of the most important factors to keep in mind is \ncountries\u2019 openness, or lack thereof, to foreigners. \nCommunities\u2019 commitment to openness affects both \nthe willingness of decisionmakers to adopt policies \nthat allow for immigration as well as migrants\u2019 desire \nto move to a specific country or region. \n\nThe role of economic differentials in encouraging \nemigration can be seen among high- and low-skilled \nmigrants alike. Average monthly wages in most ASEAN \nMember States are much lower than in favored OECD \ndestinations. According to a survey conducted by \nTalent Corporation, a government agency created in \npart to promote dialogue with the Malaysian diaspora, \nbetter professional opportunities and higher salaries \nwere the top reasons skilled Malaysians emigrated to \nOECD countries.30 In another survey, skilled temporary \nworkers moving from Southeast Asia to Australia cited \nbetter job opportunities (97%), international experience \n(91%), and higher salaries (89%) as their top three \nreasons for emigrating.31 Moreover, the survey data \nshow that better job opportunities and higher salaries \nwere far more important for Southeast Asians than for \nmigrants from People\u2019s Republic of China, India, South \nAfrica, and other countries. However, while economic \nconsiderations are key, lifestyle and environmental \nfactors also affect migration decisions, particularly those \nof the highly skilled who have both the opportunity and \nthe means to emigrate.32\n\n28 \n\nInformation on average wages for Brunei Darussalam is not available. \nDollars used throughout the report are USD.\n\n29  This figure is based on 2010 ILO estimates. Wages for Myanmar are not \navailable, though Myanmar\u2019s economic development is usually grouped \nwith that of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. While Indonesian \nwages are low, it is considered to be an emerging economy and more \ndynamic than other countries with the same average monthly wages.\n30  World Bank, Improving the Effectiveness of the TalentCorp\u2019s Initiatives: \nAssessment of Returning Expert Programme and Residence Pass\u2014Talent \n(Washington, DC: World Bank, 2015), http://talentcorpbucket.\ns3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets/contentms/img/\ntemplate/editor/Report-Talent-Corp-Final-June-23.pdf.\n\n31  Siew-Ean Khoo et al., \u201cA Global Labor Market: Factors Motivating the \nSponsorship and Temporary Migration of Skilled Workers to Australia,\u201d \nInternational Migration Review 41, no. 2 (2007): 480\u2013510.   \n\n32  Demetrios G.

For \ninstance, the WVS asked respondents who they \nwould prefer not to have as neighbors, and listed \nimmigrants/foreign workers among the options.34 \nClose to 60% of respondents in Malaysia and \nThailand and more than one-third in Indonesia, \nSingapore, and Viet Nam selected immigrants/\nforeign workers as less-desired neighbors,35 \ncompared to only 14% of respondents in the \nPhilippines.36 The survey also asked respondents \nto agree or disagree with the following statement: \n\u201cWhen jobs are scarce, employers should give \npriority to people of this country over immigrants.\u201d \nIn the six participating countries, more than 60% \nof respondents agreed with the statement, ranging \nfrom 62% in Thailand, to 80% in the Philippines, and \n90% in Malaysia.37 \n\n33  World Values Survey (WVS) data are available for only four ASEAN \nMember States in the most recent round (Round 6, 2010\u201314) and \nanother two in the previous round (Round 5, 2006\u201310).\n\n34  The question specifically asks: \u201cOn this list are various groups of \n\npeople. Could you please mention any that you would not like to have \nas neighbors?\u201d Individuals are to select from the list, with immigrants/\nforeign workers being one option. Percentages are based on whether \nrespondents select a given option.\n\n35  WVS, \u201cWVS Wave 6 (2010\u20132014): Thailand 2013,\u201d accessed 13 July \n2016, www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp. \n36  WVS, \u201cWVS Wave 6 (2010\u20132014): Philippines 2012,\u201d accessed 13 July \n2016, www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp.\n37  WVS, \u201cWVS Wave 6 (2010\u20132014): Malaysia 2011,\u201d accessed 13 July \n2016, www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp.\n\n\fhuman-Capital Development and mobility\n\n11\n\nIt has to be noted that the survey questionnaire \ndid not differentiate between attitudes toward \nhighly and less educated immigrants; it is possible \nthat the latter are the primary target of negative \npublic opinion. In any case, governments need \nto proactively engage the public and other key \nstakeholders on this matter and make the case for \naccepting foreign workers across skill levels if they \nhope to promote regional circulation.\n\ne.   Megatrends and their implications \nfor Human capital Development \nand skills Circulation\n\nOn the whole, the convergence of sweeping trends\u2014\ndemographic, educational, economic, and social\u2014\npresents opportunities for greater human capital \ndevelopment and skills circulation within ASEAN. \n\nFor one, the young are most responsive to \nmigration opportunities. Outward migration \n\nwill not only continue to serve as an important \nmechanism for lowering youth unemployment \nbut also for skill building and circulation. Tourism \nprofessionals, covered by one of the ASEAN \nMRAs, epitomize this opportunity. As an industry, \ntourism is key for Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, \nand Viet Nam.38 If trained in a common ASEAN-\nlevel curriculum, it would be much easier for \ntourism professionals to move between ASEAN \ncountries and, in the process, not only avoid \nun- and underemployment at home but also gain \nvaluable international work experience.\n\nRegional and domestic labor forces are interlinked. \nRising educational attainment across a region \nhelps grow the number and share of skilled and \nmid-skilled workers in a given country. This, in \nturn, means that a greater number of people might \nmove within the region, given the right incentives \nand supporting mechanisms, such as well-\nimplemented MRAs.  \n\n38  ADB, Asian Development Outlook 2015: Financing Asia\u2019s Future \n\nGrowth (Manila: ADB, 2015), www.adb.org/sites/default/files/\npublication/154508/ado-2015.pdf.\n\n\fiii.  Two Pressing Challenges facing \nasean: Brain Waste and Brain Drain\n\nDisparities in economic growth and social \n\ndevelopment coupled with other megatrends, \nsuch as uneven demographic trajectories \n\nand rising levels of educational attainment, mean \nthat brain circulation is not just a political whim \nbut will also be an integral part of the AEC moving \nforward.39 Accomplishing this will depend on \na proactive regional approach to tackling two \ncritical challenges: brain waste and brain drain. \n\nBrain waste comes with significant economic and \nsocial costs for both individual professionals and the \ncommunities in which they live, and is therefore worth \nmonitoring. A forthcoming Migration Policy Institute \n(MPI) report estimates that approximately 2 million \nhighly educated immigrants in the United States are \nunderemployed. The cost of this underemployment \nto these immigrants, their families, and the national \neconomy is estimated at US $40 billion annually.41\n\na.   Brain waste: a \u201csleeper\u201d issue  \n\n1.  Brain Waste in the OECD\n\nin asean\n\nBrain waste refers to the poor transfer and \nineffective use of immigrants\u2019 formal and informal \nqualifications.40 Due to major data gaps, brain waste \nis largely an understudied \u201csleeper\u201d issue that has \nnot been on the radar for policymakers. Also referred \nto as skill underutilization, brain waste occurs when \ntertiary-educated migrants are either unemployed or \nare working in jobs that are below their qualifications. \nThe effects of skill underutilization are pernicious. \nThe human capital that newcomers bring with them \nslowly degrades and the investments made by both \nthe country of origin and the migrants themselves \nare wasted. A qualified teacher from the Philippines \nworking as a domestic worker in Singapore or a \nhighly trained engineer from Thailand working as a \nconstruction worker in the United States are telling \nexamples of skill underutilization.\n\n39  Bruni, \u201cLabor Market and Demographic Scenarios for ASEAN Countries.\u201d\n40  Madeleine Sumption, Tackling Brain Waste: Strategies to Improve the \nRecognition of Immigrants\u2019 Foreign Qualifications (Washington, DC: \nMPI, 2013), www.migrationpolicy.org/research/tackling-brain-waste-\nstrategies-improve-recognition-immigrants%E2%80%99-foreign-\nqualifications; Aaditya Mattoo and Deepak Mishra, \u201cForeign Professionals \nin the United States: Regulatory Impediments to Trade,\u201d Journal of \nInternational Economic Law 12, no. 2 (2009): 435\u201356.\n\nOECD data permit examination of the extent of brain \nwaste among ASEAN tertiary-educated migrants in \nOECD countries. Figure 4 shows that 36% of all skilled \nmigrants in OECD countries are overqualified relative \nto the jobs they hold; this share is much higher for \nthose from Thailand (52%), the Philippines (47%), and \nLao PDR (45%). In contrast, migrants from Malaysia \nand Singapore were the least likely to be overqualified \n(22% and 21%, respectively), even when compared \nwith OECD native-born college graduates (28%). \n\n2.  Brain Waste within ASEAN\n\nWithout adequate data, it is extremely difficult to \nassess fully either the extent or underlying causes \nof brain waste within ASEAN. Anecdotal evidence \nfrom the focus group discussions organized to inform \nthis report, meanwhile, indicates its existence. For \nexample, engineers from Myanmar work as assistant \nengineers or site supervisors in Singapore and \nThailand because they do not want to or cannot pass \nlocal license exams. Similarly, medical doctors who \n\n41 \n\nJeanne Batalova, Michael Fix, and James Bachmeier, Untapped Talent: \nThe Costs of Brain Waste among Highly Skilled Immigrants in the United \nStates (Washington, DC: MPI, forthcoming).\n\n12\n\n\fTwo Pressing Challenges facing asean\n\n13\n\nFigure 4: overqualification rates of tertiary-educated persons in organisation for economic  \nCo-operation and Development, by nativity and Country of origin, 2010\u201311 \n(%)\n\n 52  \n\n 47  \n\n 45  \n\n 41  \n\n 40  \n\n 36  \n\n 36  \n\nAll Migrants OECD \n\nOECD Native Born \n\n 22  \n\n 21  \n\nThailand \n\nPhilippines  Lao PDR \n\nCambodia  Myanmar \n\nViet Nam \n\nIndonesia  Malaysia \n\nSingapore \n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nSource: MPI tabulations of data from OECD, Connecting with Emigrants: A Global Profile of Diasporas 2015 (Paris: OECD Publishing, 2015), \nwww.oecd.org/publications/connecting-with-emigrants-9789264239845-en.htm.\n\ncannot pass a local license exam may work as medical \ninterpreters and provide other social support services \nto hospital patients who speak the same language.  \n\nIn fact, ASEAN may experience the worst of public \npolicy outcomes: While sending countries lose talent, \nreceiving countries and foreign professionals fail to fully \nbenefit from mobility. While it is to be hoped that the \nMRAs will help cut the significant losses associated \nwith underemployment, their implementation has hit \nmany obstacles.42 \n\n3.  Main Reasons for the Underutilization \n\nof Migrant Skills \n\nThe economic contributions of foreign workers depend \non whether they can put their formal and informal \nqualifications (such as education, skills, languages, \nand professional experience) to good use in a new \nlabor market. Research identifies a number of critical \nobstacles\u2014at the individual, labor market, and systemic \nlevels\u2014that limit fair gainful employment and weaken \neconomic mobility prospects for skilled migrant workers.43\n\n42  See Mendoza and Sugiyarto, The Long Road Ahead: Status Report on \n\nthe Implementation of the ASEAN Mutual Recognition Arrangements on \nProfessional Services (Manila: ADB, forthcoming).\n\n43  Sumption, Tackling Brain Waste; Lesleyanne Hawthorne, Recognizing \nForeign Qualifications: Emerging Global Trends (Washington, DC: MPI, \n2013), www.migrationpolicy.org/research/recognizing-foreign-\nqualifications-emerging-global-trends; Linda Rabben, Credential \nRecognition in the United States for Foreign Professionals (Washington, DC: \nMPI, 2013), www.migrationpolicy.org/research/credential-recognition-\nunited-states-foreign-professionals. \n\nAt the individual level, obstacles include foreign \nworkers\u2019 limited proficiency in local languages and \nlack of familiarity with workplace culture; prior \nlocal work experience, which is highly valued by \nemployers; access to local professional networks; \nand education and professional experience expected \nin the host economy. \n\nLabor market level barriers include employers\u2019 \nlimited capacity to assess the qualifications and \nwork eligibility of foreign workers. This is especially \nthe case for small and medium enterprises that\u2014\nunlike large international corporations\u2014do not have \ndedicated human resource personnel and have little \nknowledge about foreign qualifications. Additional \nbarriers include discrimination by employers based \non race and cultural differences, foreign-sounding \nnames, and foreign accents. \n\nFinally, systemic issues include lack of transparency \nregarding the requirements, steps, and time \nneeded to recognize foreign qualifications; limited \nopportunities to bridge the gaps between migrants\u2019 \nforeign qualifications and domestic requirements in \na timely and financially affordable way; and finally, \nlack of coordination and sometimes interest on the \npart of key stakeholders (employers, professional \nassociations, educational institutions, and \ngovernments) in reducing these barriers. \n\n\f14\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\nIt is crucial to note that brain waste is particularly \nchallenging because it afflicts not only migrant \nworkers but also the homegrown labor force. In some \ncountries with fast-growing working-age populations, \nmany native-born workers are unable to find well-\npaid jobs that match their education levels. This, \nin addition to other factors, spurs emigration and \ncontributes to brain drain. Thus, while brain waste \nreflects demographic and structural issues, brain \ndrain, discussed in the next section, is a symptom of \nthese larger forces.\n\nB.   Brain Drain: Varying Degrees  \nof Magnitude and intensity  \nacross asean\n\nAlmost all countries experience brain drain.44 This \nloss of human capital in the fields of medicine, \nscience, engineering, management, and education \ncan be a major obstacle to economic and social \ndevelopment.45 People with higher levels of human \ncapital have more opportunities and means to cross \nborders. The Gallup World Poll 2007\u201313 indicates \nthat persons employed in professional occupations \nwere nearly twice as likely to emigrate (19%) than \nthose in low-skilled occupations (10%).46 \n\nBrain drain can be measured by magnitude, that is, \nthe absolute number of highly educated people who \nemigrate. It can also be measured as a ratio of skilled \n\n44  Historically, the emigration of highly educated and skilled people has \n\nbeen viewed as harmful to countries\u2019 economic development and social \nprogress. The term \u201cbrain drain\u201d was originally coined by the British \nRoyal Society to describe the departure of British scientists to the United \nStates in the 1950s. The influential work of Jagdish N. Bhagwati in the \n1970s, among others, shifted the attention to the impact of brain drain \non developing countries. Policy ideas to stem, or at least compensate for, \nthe adverse effects of brain drain included imposing a supplementary tax \non the incomes of skilled immigrants in developed countries, punitive \nmeasures against recruiting agencies, and quotas on the departure of \nskilled persons. For a review of the theoretical and empirical literature \non brain drain, see Pierpaolo Giannoccolo, \u201cThe Brain Drain: A Survey \nof the Literature\u201d (working paper no. 2006-03-02, Social Science \nResearch Network, 7 April 2009), http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/\npapers.cfm?abstract_id=1374329. Over time, however, policy and \ndevelopment literature has evolved to recognize that the reasons for \nskilled migration are complex and the consequences are not always \nnegative.

Brain Drain in the OECD\n\nHigh-income OECD countries have been and remain \nthe primary destinations for highly educated people \nfrom many parts of the world, including from ASEAN. \nRecent OECD data show that the number of tertiary-\neducated immigrants from the region residing in \nOECD countries increased from 1.7 million in 2000 \nto 2.8 million in 2010\u20132011, or by 66% (see Table 5).\n\ntable 5: tertiary-educated Migrants in oeCD \nCountries by Country of origin,  \n2000\u20132001 and 2010\u20132011\n\norigin\ntotal\n\n2000\u20132001 2010\u20132011\n31,133,150\n18,097,377\n\nFrom asean\nBrunei Darussalam\n\n1,679,453\n3,358\n\n2,791,727\n5,854\n\nCambodia\n\nindonesia\n\nlao PDr\n\nmalaysia\n\nmyanmar\n\nPhilippines\n\nsingapore\n\nThailand\n\n36,456\n\n117,035\n\n37,469\n\n101,998\n\n25,170\n\n52,552\n\n153,884\n\n52,035\n\n169,471\n\n42,090\n\n889,072\n\n1,545,164\n\n46,327\n\n74,427\n\n74,658\n\n156,920\n\n% Change:  \n2000 to \n2010\u20132011\n72.0\n\n66.2\n74.3\n\n44.2\n\n31.5\n\n38.9\n\n66.2\n\n67.2\n\n73.8\n\n61.2\n\n110.8\n\n348,141\n\nViet nam\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment.\nNote: Data refer to people ages 15 and older.\nSource: MPI tabulations of data from OECD, Connecting with Emigrants.\n\n539,099\n\n54.9\n\nThe number of highly educated migrants from \nseveral ASEAN countries residing in OECD countries \nalso grew greatly within the decade: the number of \nThai migrants more than doubled, and the number \nfrom Brunei Darussalam and the Philippines grew \nby about 74%. Of the 2.8 million tertiary-educated \npersons from the ASEAN region residing in OECD \ncountries in 2010\u20132011, more than 1.5 million were \nfrom the Philippines. \n\n\fTwo Pressing Challenges facing asean\n\n15\n\nA close observation of these numbers reveals two \ntrends worth highlighting. First, more than half of the \nhighly educated ASEAN nationals residing in OECD \ncountries arrived within the last decade, suggesting \nthat the draw of OECD countries remains strong. \nThese post-2000 migrants act as a powerful base for \njob networks and support for future skilled migrants. \n\nSecond, compared with the total migrant population \nin OECD countries, ASEAN migrants are more likely \nto be highly educated. In 2010\u20132011, just 30% of all \nmigrants residing in OECD countries had a tertiary \neducation (see Figure 5). In contrast, more than 50% \nof Filipinos, Malaysians, and Singaporeans in OECD \ncountries were highly educated. Furthermore, the \ntertiary-educated share among ASEAN migrants \nresiding in OECD countries increased significantly \nbetween 2000\u20132001 and 2010\u20132011 (with the \nexception of those from Myanmar).47\n\nIn terms of population size, more than 31 million \nhighly educated migrants resided in OECD countries \nin 2010\u201311. Collectively, they represented 5% of all \n\ntertiary-educated persons in the world.

The emigration \nrate of highly educated persons from Cambodia and \nLao PDR to OECD countries (about 15% each) was \nthree times higher than the OECD global average \n(5%). Close to 10% of tertiary-educated adults from \nthe Philippines, Singapore, and Viet Nam resided \nin OECD countries. By contrast, less than 3% of the \nhighly educated populations of Indonesia, Myanmar, \nand Thailand resided in OECD countries. \n\nBetween 2000\u20132001 and 2010\u20132011, the \nemigration rate of the highly educated remained \nrather stable for six of the 10 ASEAN countries: \nIndonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand. In contrast, the rate for \nLao PDR declined from 25% to 15% and for Viet \nNam from 18% to about 11%. It dropped sharply for \nCambodia from 53% to 15% within the decade. It \nis not clear whether these trends reflect a decisive \nshift away from emigration to OECD countries. \nWhat is clearer is that the rapidly rising educational \nattainment within ASEAN is likely mitigating the \neffect of continuous highly skilled emigration.\n\nOne way to examine brain drain is to compare the \nnumber of highly educated emigrants with the \nnumber of skilled immigrants. Figure 6 examines \nthese trends for three ASEAN countries with available \ndata. It compares the size of highly educated migrants \nfrom Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand in OECD \ncountries and the number of tertiary-educated \nimmigrants in these three countries.\n\nBoth Cambodia and Malaysia experienced a greater \noutflow of skilled individuals than they received, a net \nloss of 47,000 and 116,000 people, respectively. In \ncontrast, Thailand had a net gain of about 82,000. \nMore information is clearly needed to better \nunderstand whether the new arrivals\u2019 human capital \nmatches the skills and education of those who left.\n\n2.   Brain Drain to Non-OECD Destinations\n\nThe estimates of brain drain presented above are for \nASEAN nationals residing in only OECD countries \nand are therefore likely to be conservative. Highly \nskilled ASEAN nationals also find employment in \n\nFigure 6: Highly educated emigrants from \nCambodia, Malaysia, and thailand in oeCD \nCountries versus Highly educated immigrants \nresiding in these three Countries, 2010\u20132011\n\n 238,796\n\n 53,801\n\n 5,088\n\n\u201352,552\n\n\u2013169,471\n\n\u2013156,920\n\nCambodia \n\nMalaysia \n\nThailand \n\nMigrants to OECD \n\nMigrants from Abroad \n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nSource:  MPI tabulations of data from OECD, Connecting with Emigrants.\n\nnon-OECD destinations. The Gulf countries are \namong the main destinations for architects from Lao \nPDR and Myanmar, nurses from Malaysia and the \nPhilippines, and engineers from the Philippines and \nViet Nam. Dentists from Singapore work in India and \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and Vietnamese dentists \nwork in Angola.48 \n\nBecause most of these professionals hold temporary \ncontracts, they are presumably of lesser concern \nthan those who go to OECD countries. However, \nthe situation is not straightforward. A case in \npoint is a government-arranged temporary work \nmigration scheme in the Philippines. Like Malaysia, \nthe Philippines greatly expanded opportunities \nfor its population to obtain post-secondary and \nuniversity-level education. Unlike in Malaysia, Filipino \ngovernment efforts to promote the postsecondary \nand university-level education of its population \nwere driven, at least in part, by the goal of exporting \nhigh-skilled workers. Today, 1.8 million Filipinos \n\n48  MPI analysis of the ADB\u2013MPI data questionnaires conducted to inform \nthis research. (Question #46: To which countries are members of MRA-\ncovered professions more likely to emigrate for either temporary work or \npermanent stay?) \n\n\fTwo Pressing Challenges facing asean\n\n17\n\nwork overseas on temporary contracts in more than \n190 countries.49 While the amount of remittances \nsent by these workers is high ($27 billion in 2014), \nthe government-sponsored emigration has had a \nnegative side effect: it has contributed to domestic \nlabor shortages, particularly in skilled occupations \nsuch as nursing, engineering, and aviation, prompting \nMendoza to describe the current situation as one of \nhuman capital \u201cshortages amid surplus.\u201d50\n\nResearch also finds that while some professionals \nmay move to the country of their final destination \ndirectly, many will pursue a step-migration strategy.51 \nFor instance, a typical trajectory for many health-\ncare professionals from the Philippines involves \nrelocating to Israel first on a fixed-term contract, then \nto Canada, and eventually to the United States for \npermanent residence. These examples highlight the \nneed to understand and track the entire migration arc, \nnot just the departure to OECD countries.\n\n3.   Reasons for Leaving: Work  \n\nand Educational Opportunities in \nOECD Countries\n\nResearch findings confirm that while skilled \nprofessionals from the ASEAN region leave for \nOECD countries for various reasons, the common \nthread is that they seek opportunities not available \nat home. Migrants respond to other countries\u2019 higher \nwages and better working conditions, prospects for \n\nprofessional development and continuous education, \nand opportunities to work with other skilled persons \nin talent clusters. As one Indonesian focus group \nparticipant put it: \u201cIn ASEAN there is a sense that we \nhave similar levels of technology and expertise, we \ncan\u2019t learn much from each other; that\u2019s why we go to \nthe developed countries for learning and invite them \nto come here.\u201d52 \n\nOthers are attracted by the possibility of gaining \npermanent residence in high-income countries such \nas Australia, Canada, the United States, and, more \nrecently, several Member States of the European Union.\n\nMany ASEAN nationals leave for OECD countries to \npursue higher education. This preference for earning a \ndegree in the West reflects, at least in part, the state of \nhigher education and training in ASEAN. Only Singapore \nand Malaysia place in the top 50 of the higher education \nand training portion of the World Economic Forum \n(WEF) Global Competitiveness Index.53 The top three \ndestinations for students from ASEAN are Australia, \nthe United States, and the United Kingdom: of 227,000 \nstudents, roughly one in four study in Australia, one in \nfive in the United States, and one in seven in the United \nKingdom. The rest pursue higher education in Japan, \nEgypt, and other countries. As discussed later in this \nreport, students who study abroad often remain in the \ncountries where they obtain their education, taking \nadvantage of language skills, degrees, and labor market \ninformation relevant to their host country.\n\n49  Dovelyn Rannveig Mendoza, Shortage amid Surplus: Emigration \nand Human Capital Development in the Philippines (Bangkok and \nWashington, DC: International Organization for Migration and MPI, \n2015), https://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/mpi_15.pdf. \nIbid., 1.\n\n50 \n\n51  Lesleaynne Hawthorne, International Health Workforce Mobility and \n\nIts Implications in the Western Pacific Region (Manila: World Health \nOrganization, West Pacific Regional Office, forthcoming).\n\n52  Participant comment during a focus group discussion organized by ADB \n\nand MPI, Bali, 26 September 2015.\n\n53  World Economic Forum (WEF), \u201cGlobal Competitiveness Index,\u201d \naccessed 25 February 2016, http://reports.weforum.org/global-\ncompetitiveness-report-2014-2015/rankings/. \n\n\f18\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\nBox 3: Brain Drain: is it always a problem?\n\nGovernments that see many of their highly educated citizens emigrating are generally concerned about the loss of human \ncapital. But is this actually a problem? On the one hand, as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Docquier puts it, \u201cThere are many more losers than \nwinners among developing countries\u201d when it comes to brain drain. Although economists have yet to develop methodologies \nto estimate the monetary costs of brain drain (which has been a challenge in the field due to lack of data and the sheer \ncomplexity of the issue), the loss of valuable human capital represents unrealized returns on a country\u2019s investments in \neducation and training. It also thins the country\u2019s knowledge base and reduces access to needed services such as health care, \neducation, and technology development. \n\nOn the other hand, as more recent research shows, highly skilled emigration has benefits. For one, in a more globally \nconnected world, this emigration is not always permanent. When returning home, migrants often bring along new skills, \nfinancial and social capital, and access to valuable networks, thus creating positive feedback effects. They also inspire others \nto pursue more education in the hope that they too might emigrate. Since not all newly trained professionals will leave the \ncountry, the domestic pool of highly skilled talent expands. Moreover, emigration eases temporary pressures on the labor \nmarket when the supply of labor outstrips available opportunities. Finally, as evidenced worldwide, migrants\u2019 remittances not \nonly improve their families\u2019 economic fortunes but also support productive investments. \n\nThe nature of migration is changing. Using Australian data on migration, Hugo, Wall, and Young demonstrate that there is \na significant circular migration of skilled people between Australia and the ASEAN countries (although about three times \nas many people move from ASEAN to Australia as those in the other direction). While many ASEAN nationals come to \nAustralia as international students or skilled temporary workers, returnees from Australia also tend to be skilled. Of those \nwho return permanently from Australia (mostly to fast-growing Singapore and Malaysia), close to 40% are professionals \nand 20% managers. The lack of detailed data in other traditional destinations for ASEAN migrants makes it difficult to draw \nparallels with the ASEAN-Australian case. That said, skills circulation is on the rise worldwide, aided by advancements in \ncommunications technology, the lower cost of international travel, and global employment opportunities.\n\nAvailable data and research make it clear that ASEAN has an opportunity to capitalize on these developments. The \nsubstantial diaspora of ASEAN nationals in predominantly high-income countries represents a unique resource that can be \nengaged to promote international trade, initiate foreign capital flows, and facilitate educational exchanges and technology \ntransfers. Put to good use, this resource will contribute to the expansion of opportunities in ASEAN. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, the changing demographics and rising levels of education across the region expand the pool of young, \neducated, and mobile professionals eager to take advantage of the economic and educational opportunities in the ASEAN \nregion, leading to greater skills circulation.\n\nSources: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Docquier, \u201cThe Brain Drain from Developing Countries,\u201d IZA World of Labor (May 2014): 6, http://wol.iza.org/\narticles/brain-drain-from-developing-countries/long; Tito Boeri et al., eds., Brain Drain and Brain Gain: The Global Competition to \nAttract High-Skilled Migrants (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2012); Adam Tyson, \u201cThe Brain Drain Cycle in Malaysia: Re-Thinking \nMigration, Diaspora and Talent,\u201d Malaysian Journal of Economic Studies 48, no. 2 (2011): 85\u201392; Satish Chand and Michael Clemens, \n\u201cSkilled Emigration and Skill Creation: A Quasi-Experiment\u201d (working paper no. 152, Center for Global Development, Washington, DC, \nSeptember 2008), www.cgdev.org/publication/skilled-emigration-and-skill-creation-quasi-experiment-working-paper-152; Albert \nBollard et al., \u201cRemittances and the Brain Drain Revisited: The Microdata Show that More Educated Migrants Remit More,\u201d World Bank \nEconomic Review 25, no. 1 (2011): 132\u201356; Graeme Hugo, Janet Wall, and Margaret Young, The Southeast Asia-Australia Regional \nMigration System: Some Insights into the \u201cNew Emigration\u201d (Washington, DC: MPI, 2015), www.migrationpolicy.org/research/southeast-\nasia-australia-regional-migration-system-some-insights-new-emigration; Demetrios G.

Brain Circulation in asean Today: \nGrowing and Diversifying flows\n\nR ecent developments suggest that \n\nbrain circulation is already substantial \nin Southeast Asia, which means that \n\nthe prospects for stemming brain drain and \nreducing brain waste are good. Until recently, \nmobility within ASEAN was limited to low-\nskilled, often irregular, and temporary workers. \nWhile the demand for less-skilled workers is \nlikely to continue far into the future, three \nimportant trends in the scale, composition, \nand direction of intraregional mobility are \npointing toward greater brain circulation.\n\na.   scale: greater intraregional Flows\n\nFirst, the number of persons moving within ASEAN \nhas grown significantly in the last 25 years, and \nthis upward trajectory is likely to continue. Cross-\nborder flows in the ASEAN region have more than \ntripled since 1990, reaching 9.9 million by 2015 \n(see Figure\u00a07).54 Approximately 6.9 million persons \nin 2015 were intraregional migrants, most of whom \ncrossed borders for employment.55 This population \nhas more than quadrupled since 1990, when it \nstood at about 1.3 million.\n\nFigure 7: Migrant population in asean, by region of origin, Various Years\n\n \n)\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nm\n\n(\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nl\nu\np\no\nP\n\n12 \n\n10 \n\n8 \n\n6 \n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n1990 \n\n1995 \n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\n2010 \n\n2015 \n\nYears \n\nASEAN Countries \n\nAll Countries \n\nSource: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), Population Division, \u201cInternational Migrant Stock:  \nThe 2015 Revision\u201d (United Nations database, POP/DB/MIG/Stock/Rev.2015, accessed 1 May 2016), www.un.org/en/\ndevelopment/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/index.shtml. \n\n54  UNDESA, Population Division, \u201cInternational Migrant Stock.\u201d\n55 \n\nILO, Analytical Report.\n\n19\n\n\f20\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\nWhile the numbers of both intraregional and other \nmigrants in ASEAN have grown since 1990, reflecting \nthe significance of the region as a migrant destination, \nintraregional migrants have made up a steadily \nincreasing share of all migrants in ASEAN. In 2015, \nintraregional migrants composed close to 70% of all \nmigrants in ASEAN, a significant increase from 45% \nin 1990. This marks a major shift toward greater \nintraregional flows, and is likely to continue.\n\napproximately 5.5 million increase in the intra-ASEAN \nmigrant population between 1990 and 2015, Thailand, \nMalaysia, and Singapore were the destinations of almost \n98% of the new migrants. Thailand alone represented \n3.5 million of the 5.5\u00a0million new migrants\u2014a sixfold \nincrease in 25 years.\n\ntable 8: intraregional Migrant population in \nasean by Country of Destination, 1990\u20132015\n\nLooking beyond the regional level, there are \nsubstantial variations in the migrant populations \nof each ASEAN Member State due to the differing \neffects of megatrends and government policies at \nthe national level. The largest absolute numbers of \nmigrants reside in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore \n(see Table 7). The migrant share of total population \nis also particularly high in Singapore (45%). In Brunei \nDarussalam, although the total number of foreign \nworkers is comparatively small, migrants account for \nnearly one-quarter of the overall population. The \nremaining six ASEAN Member States have small \nmigrant populations both in absolute numbers and as \nshares of the total population.\n\nSince 1990, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore have \nhosted the largest numbers of intraregional migrants \n(see Table 8). In the past 25 years, meanwhile, the \ndisparity between these three countries and the other \nseven ASEAN countries has grown exponentially.

These five countries \nare the dominant sources of intraregional migrants, \ncomposing 98% of the increase in such migrants since \n1990 (see Table 9). In 2015, migrants from these \nfive countries constituted 94% of the approximately \n6.9\u00a0million intraregional migrants in ASEAN, as well as \n65% of the 9.9 million global migrants in the region.56\n\nThe growth in the number of intraregional migrants \nin ASEAN over the past 25 years has reenforced a \ndivision between sending and receiving countries that \nwas less clear at the end of the 20th century. Low-\nskilled migrants have accounted for the majority of \nthis growth.

Composition: a rise in High-skilled \n\nintra-asean Migration\n\nAs in the past, approximately 90% of intra-\nASEAN migrants are low-skilled,57 temporary, and \nunauthorized,58 filling labor gaps in many low-skilled \noccupations and industries throughout the region.59 \nHigh-skilled migrants compose an increasing, though \nstill small, proportion of the intraregional migrant \npopulation, fueled in part by university students. \n\nThe current state of skills mobility is hard to assess: \ncurrent data collected at the global and regional \nlevel provide only limited information on the \nnumber and characteristics of professionals (defined \neither by occupation or educational attainment). \nTo show that high-skilled intra-ASEAN migration \nis, in fact, increasing, this section looks at three \nregional indicators: rising education levels, the \n\n57  Aniceto C.

Rising Education Levels of Migrants  \n\nin ASEAN \n\nAvailable data suggest that while the number of highly \neducated migrants in the region is growing, it is still fairly \nsmall in both absolute and proportional terms. \n\nThe educational composition of migrant populations \nacross ASEAN is also far from uniform, reflecting the \nnature of each country\u2019s economy and the resulting \nlabor needs. While fewer than 10% of migrant adults in \nCambodia and Malaysia have a tertiary education, 64% of \nthose in the Philippines do (see Figure 8). Although there \nare no comparable data for other ASEAN countries, it \nis likely that migrants have high levels of education in \nSingapore, owing to an immigration policy that prioritizes \nskills and education.\n\nOne notable finding, depicted in Figure 8, is that the \nshare of tertiary-educated migrants in the Philippines \n(64%), Indonesia (16%), and Cambodia (6%) was about \ntwice as high as among the total population (31%, 8%, \nand 2%, respectively). In other words, although the size \nof the migrant populations in the Philippines, Indonesia, \nand Cambodia are smaller than in Malaysia, they tend to \nbe highly educated.\n\nA recent OECD report60 provides information on the size \nand origin countries of tertiary-educated persons in three \nASEAN countries: Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand \n(see Table 10). According to data collected by OECD \ncountries,61 the highly educated migrant population \nin Thailand grew impressively between 2000\u20132001 \nand 2010\u20132011, increasing more than tenfold. More \nthan half of the 238,796 tertiary-educated foreigners \nin Thailand were from non-ASEAN countries. As in \nThailand, the highly educated migrant population in \nCambodia also grew, albeit from a much smaller base; \nfrom 2,510 in 2000\u20132001, it grew to 5,088 in 2010\u2013\n2011 (by 103%). Meanwhile, the number of tertiary-\neducated foreigners in Malaysia declined by about \n9%\u00a0during the same period.\n\n60  OECD, Connecting with Emigrants. \n61  OECD, \u201cDatabase on Immigrants in OECD and Non-OECD Countries: \nDIOC,\u201d accessed 1 December 2015, www.oecd.org/els/mig/dioc.\nhtm. \n\n\f22\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\nFigure 8: share of total and Migrant working-age population  \nwith tertiary-level education in select asean Countries \n(%)\n\n \n\n \n\nd\ne\nt\na\nc\nu\nd\ne\ny\nr\na\ni\nt\nr\ne\nt\n \nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n64 \n\n31 \n\nPhilippines\n(2010)\n\n16 \n\n8 \n\nIndonesia\n(2014)\n\n12 \n\n12 \n\nBrunei Darussalam\n(2011) \n\nCountry and Year \n\nTotal Population \n\nMigrant Population \n\n27 \n\n9 \n\nMalaysia\n(2014)\n\n6 \n\n2 \n\nCambodia\n(2013)\n\nNotes: Working-age population includes persons ages 15 and above. \u201cTertiary education\u201d includes International Standard Classification \nof Education (ISCED 2011) group levels 5 (short-cycle tertiary education), 6 (bachelor\u2019s or equivalent level), 7 (master\u2019s or equivalent \nlevel), and 8 (doctoral or equivalent level).\nSource: ILO, Analytical Report.\n\ntable 10: tertiary-educated Foreigners  \n(ages 15 and older) in thailand,  \nMalaysia, and Cambodia\n\nTotal 2000\u201301\n\nTotal 2010\u201311\n\nthailand Malaysia Cambodia\n58,800\n\n20,396\n\n2,510\n\n238,796\n\n53,801\n\n5,088\n\n% change\nSource: MPI tabulations of data from OECD, Connecting with Emigrants.\n\n102.7\n\n1,071\n\n\u20138.5\n\n2.   Employment in High-Skilled \n\nOccupations \n\nAnother indicator of a shift toward high-skilled \nmigration in ASEAN is employment in high-skilled \n\noccupations. The absolute number of migrants \nworking in high-skilled occupations remains low. \nHowever, even this relatively small number is \nextremely important in meeting labor force gaps in \nsome professions.\n\nOf four ASEAN countries featured in a recent ILO \nreport, only Brunei Darussalam has a relatively \nlarge share of migrants employed in high-skilled \noccupations (18%; see Table 11). The share of \nmigrants in high-skilled occupations is small \nin Malaysia (about 3%), Thailand (2%), and \nCambodia (less than 1%) relative to the total \nnumber of migrant workers.\n\ntable 11: total workers and Migrant workers in High-skilled occupations, latest Year\n\nBrunei Darussalam (2011)\n\nCambodia (2013)\n\nmalaysia (2014)\n\ntotal employed\n\ntotal \n183,700\n\n8,059,600\n\nin High-\nskilled Jobs\n\n59,200\n\n396,300\n\n13,532,100\n\n3,408,100\n\n1,782,300\n\n49,200\n\nemployed Migrants\n\ntotal \nMigrants\n67,700\n\n% Migrants of \ntotal employed\n36.9\n\nin High-\nskilled Jobs\n10,700\n\n% Migrants in \nHigh-skilled Jobs\n18.1\n\n0.6\n\n13.2\n\n3.1\n\n2,700\n\n89,700\n\n130,300\n\n0.7\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\nThailand (2014)\nNotes: High-skill occupations include managers, technicians, and associated professionals. \nSource: ILO, Analytical Report.\n\n38,020,400\n\n5,392,800\n\n1,183,800\n\n\fBrain Circulation in asean Today\n\n23\n\nThe share of foreign professionals in MRA-covered \noccupations in the professional labor force can be \ngauged using data shared by regional experts.62 \nUnsurprisingly, the shares vary by both country \nand profession. For instance, foreign professionals \nin Malaysia accounted for less than 1% among \naccountants (120 out of 30,300),63 but 18% among \nsurveyors (2,000 of 11,300) (see Figure 9). In Lao \nPDR, the field of engineering employed about 1,000 \nforeigners (who represented 14% of the roughly 7,000 \nprofessional engineers). In contrast, the number of \nforeign medical doctors in Lao PDR was small (200), \nbut accounted for 11% of the country\u2019s medical \ndoctors (see Figure 9)\u2014highlighting the fact that even \na small number of foreigners can make a difference in \nsome sectors. \n\nA lack of data hampers understanding of the number \nand shares of foreign professionals in the region. For \nexample, while there are no data for Singapore, it is \ncommon knowledge that a significant proportion of \nmigrants work in skilled occupations in the country. \nIt is highly likely that the number of ASEAN foreign \nprofessionals working throughout the region is larger \nthan can be estimated at the moment.\n\nFigure 9: share of Foreigners among Medical \nprofessionals in lao pDr and surveyors in \nMalaysia\n\nTotal Medical Professionals\nin Lao PDR\n\nTotal Survey Professionals\n in Malaysia\n\n11% \n\n18% \n\n89% \n\n82% \n\nForeigners \n\nNationals \n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank (ADB)-MPI data questionnaires, Lao \nPDR and Malaysia, August 2015\u2013February 2016.\n\n62  These estimates represent workers in MRA occupations in general, not \n\nnecessarily those who utilized the MRA process.\n\n63  Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA), Evolving to Lead: Annual \n\nReport 2015 (Kuala Lumpur: MIA, 2015), www.mia.org.my/ar/2015/\ndownloads/MalaysianInstituteofAccountantsAnnualReport2015.pdf. \n\n3.   Increasing Numbers of International \n\nStudents \n\nInternational students are viewed by governments \nand employers as a valuable pool of future skilled \nworkers.64 This is for a number of reasons:65 their \neducation in the host country is easily recognized \nby local governments, employers, and professional \nassociations; they are proficient in the local language \nor languages; and they know how the host country\u2019s \nlabor market and society work. As a result, most \nstakeholders promote and are interested in facilitating \nthe movement of students throughout ASEAN.\n\nThe number of foreign students studying at \nuniversities globally nearly quadrupled from \n1.3\u00a0million in 1990 to 4.2 million in 2010,66 and is \nprojected to rise to 8 million by 2025.67 Asia has \nbeen the top source of foreign students for most \nOECD countries. In recent years, People\u2019s Republic \nof China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and The \nRepublic of Korea\u2014traditionally the main sending \ncountries\u2014have boosted their own capacity to \nprovide educational and research opportunities for a \ngrowing number of international students, particularly \nfrom East Asia and the Pacific.68 \n\nThis trend is also evident in ASEAN. While most \nASEAN students enroll in domestic public and private \ninstitutions for their higher education, a significant \nnumber seek educational opportunities abroad. \nThailand has the highest growth rate of international \nstudents (a fivefold increase from 4,000 in 2005 \n\n64 \n\nInternational students are defined in this report as those who have \ncrossed a national border and moved to another country with the \nobjective of obtaining a tertiary education.\n\n65  Lesleyanne Hawthorne, \u201cDemography, Migration and Demand for \n\nInternational Students,\u201d in Globalisation and Tertiary Education in the \nAsia-Pacific: The Changing Nature of a Dynamic Market, eds.

In contrast, approximately \none in five college students in Singapore came from \nanother country.70 \n\nAmong ASEAN countries, about 50,000 more \nstudents from Viet Nam left the country to study \nthan came from elsewhere to Viet Nam. This is \n\nfollowed by Indonesia (32,000) and Malaysia \n(16,000). In the meantime, Singapore received \na net inflow of 26,000 students (see Table 12). \nIn addition, due to the limited availability of data \non the countries of origin of students leaving for \nSingapore, the actual net outflows in Indonesia \nand Malaysia are likely to be higher since both \ncountries send a considerable number of students \nto Singapore. To prevent permanent loss of \nyoung talent, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, \nMalaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Viet Nam may \nrequire that students and scholars on government \nscholarships return home for a certain period of \ntime.71 Brunei Darussalam, for example, requires its \nstudents to return for 10 years, and imposes stiff \npenalties on those who do not.\n\ntable 12: University-level students by asean Country, Various Years\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\ntotal enrollment1\n\ninternational students\n% of total \nenrollment\n4.0\n\nnumber2\n360\n\nnumber of own \nstudents abroad3\n3,365\n\nnet in/out Flow of \nstudents\n\u20133,011\n\nCambodia\n\nindonesia\n\nlao PDr\n\nmalaysia\n\nmyanmar\n\nPhilippines\n\nsingapore\n\nThailand\n\nViet nam\ntotal asean4\n\n8,797\n\n223,222\n\n6,423,455\n\n137,092\n\n1,116,733\n\n634,306\n\n3,317,265\n\n255,348\n\n2,405,109\n\n2,250,030\n\n\u2013\n\n7,235\n\n543\n\n40,471\n\n100\n\n2,665\n\n48,938\n\n20,309\n\n2,540\n\n\u2013\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n3.6\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.7\n\n19.2\n\n4,221\n\n39,098\n\n4,985\n\n56,260\n\n6,388\n\n11,454\n\n22,578\n\n25,517\n\n53,546\n\n\u2013\n\n\u201331,863\n\n\u20134,668\n\n\u201315,789\n\n\u20136,288\n\n\u20138,789\n\n26,360\n\n\u20135,208\n\n\u201349,938\n\n16,771,357\n\n123,997\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\nNote: International students are defined here as those who have crossed a national border and moved to another country to obtain tertiary education. \n1  Total enrollment in Cambodia is based on 2011 data and in Myanmar on 2012 data.\n2  Number of international students is based on data from various years: 2014 (Brunei Darussalam, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam); 2013 (Malaysia and \n\nSingapore); 2012 (Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand); and 2008 (the Philippines).\n\n3  Number of own students studying abroad shown here does not include international students studying in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, \n\nand Singapore, since these four countries do not report the country of origin of international students.\n\n4  MPI estimate.\nSource: MPI tabulations of data from UNESCO, \u201cInstitute for Statistics (UIS) Database: Education,\u201d accessed 1 March 2016, http://data.uis.unesco.\norg/Index.aspx. \n\n69  MPI tabulations of data from UNESCO, \u201cInstitute for Statistics (UIS) \nDatabase: Education,\u201d accessed 1 March 2016, http://data.uis.\nunesco.org/Index.aspx.\n\n70  Singapore does not report foreign student data by country of origin; \n\nhence, the intraregional student mobility between Singapore and other \nspecific ASEAN countries cannot be assessed.\n\n71  Participant comments during a focus group discussion organized by \n\nADB and MPI, Manila, 3 September 2015; participant comments \nduring the Bali Forum on Skill Mobility in ASEAN, organized by ADB \nand MPI, Bali, 28-29 September 2015.\n\n\fBrain Circulation in asean Today\n\n25\n\nC.

Directional Shift among Labor Migrants \n\nincrease of 28% from 2010 (see Table 13).73 Between \n2010 and 2014, the share of foreigners increased, \nwith the largest increase among Filipino professionals \n(from 10% to 15%). \n\nThe number of other ASEAN nationals who were \nnurses and midwives in Singapore also increased: \nMalaysians tripled from 508 to 1,797 and those from \nMyanmar doubled from 550 to 1,104. The SNB \nstatistics likely underestimate the total flow of ASEAN \nnurses and midwives because some ASEAN nationals \nare permanent residents.\n\nSingapore is the traditional destination for highly \nskilled ASEAN migrants due to its active recruitment \nof foreign talent.72 The government collects \nextensive data on its resident population, including \nby citizenship and ethnicity, but these data are \ngenerally unavailable to nongovernment researchers. \nHence, data collected by professional associations in \nSingapore has been used for this report.\n\nAccording to Singapore Nursing Board (SNB) annual \nreports, there were 37,618 nurses and midwives \nregistered with the SNB by the end of 2014, an \n\nIn recent years, however, several changes might \nbe noted. Most relevant to this discussion is that \nfewer high-skilled migrants are leaving for OECD \ncountries and more are moving across the region, \nand not only to Singapore. One example is Filipino \nnurses and engineers. According to Philippine \nOverseas Employment Administration (POEA) \ndata, the numbers of Filipino nurses and engineers \nwho were placed through government-supported \nwork programs within ASEAN has been on the rise, \nalthough the numbers were still small relative to \nthose being placed in the Middle East (see Figure\u00a010). \n\ntable 13: Citizenship of nurses and Midwives on the snB register, 2010 and 2014\n\ntotal\nsingaporean*\n\nmalaysian\n\nChinese\n\nfilipino\n\nindian\n\nmyanmar\n\n2010\n\n2014\n\nnumber\n29,340\n23,482\n\n508\n\n834\n\n2,951\n\n784\n\n550\n\n% of total\n100.0\n80.0\n\n1.7\n\n2.8\n\n10.1\n\n2.7\n\n1.9\n\nnumber\n37,618\n26,577\n\n1,797\n\n1,236\n\n5,680\n\n922\n\n1,104\n\n% of total\n100.0\n70.6\n\n4.8\n\n3.3\n\n15.1\n\n2.5\n\n2.9\n\n% Change:  \n2010 to 2014\n28.2\n13.2\n\n253.7\n\n48.2\n\n92.5\n\n17.6\n\n100.7\n\n231\n\nother\nSNB = Singapore Nursing Board.\n*Includes permanent residents.\nSources: Singapore Nursing Board (SNB), Annual Report 2014 (Singapore: SNB, 2014), www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/content/dam/hprof/snb/\ndocs/publications/SNB%20Annual%20Report%202014.pdf; SNB, Annual Report 2010 (Singapore: SNB, 2010), www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/\ncontent/dam/hprof/snb/docs/publications/Annual%20Report%202010_1.pdf.\n\n30.7\n\n302\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n72  Brenda Yeoh and Weiqiang Lin, \u201cRapid Growth in Singapore\u2019s \n\nImmigrant Population Brings Policy Challenges,\u201d Migration Information \nSource, 3 April 2012, www.migrationpolicy.org/article/rapid-growth-\nsingapores-immigrant-population-brings-policy-challenges.\n\n73  Singapore Nursing Board (SNB), Annual Report 2014 (Singapore: SNB, \n2014), www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/content/dam/hprof/snb/\ndocs/publications/SNB%20Annual%20Report%202014.pdf; SNB, \nAnnual Report 2010 (Singapore: SNB, 2010), www.healthprofessionals.\ngov.sg/content/dam/hprof/snb/docs/publications/Annual%20\nReport%202010_1.pdf. \n\n\f26\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\nFigure 10: number of Deployed Filipino nurses and engineers, by Destination region, 1995\u20132010\n\nNurses \n\nEngineers \n\n14,000 \n\n12,000 \n\n10,000 \n\n8,000 \n\n6,000 \n\n4,000 \n\n2,000 \n\n \n\ns\ne\ns\nr\nu\nN\n\n \nf\no\n \nr\ne\nb\nm\nu\nN\n\n0 \n1995 \n\n7,000 \n\n6,000 \n\n5,000 \n\n4,000 \n\n3,000 \n\n2,000 \n\n1,000 \n\n \n\ns\nr\ne\ne\nn\ni\ng\nn\nE\n \nf\no\n \nr\ne\nb\nm\nu\nN\n\n0 \n1995 \n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\n2010 \n\nYear \n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\n2010 \n\nYear \n\nTOTAL \n\nMiddle East \n\nASEAN \n\nNotes: Working-age population includes persons ages 15 and above. \u201cTertiary education\u201d includes International Standard Classification \noSource: MPI tabulations of data from Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), \u201cOverseas Filipino Workers: Deployment \nStatistics (Various Years),\u201d accessed 1 December 2015, www.poea.gov.ph/ofwstat/ofwstat.html.\n\nIn\u00a02010, 794 Filipino nurses left for ASEAN \ncountries, with almost all moving to Singapore (722) \nand Brunei Darussalam (63).

Moreover, \nthe number of tertiary-educated immigrants in \nThailand is much smaller than the number of low-\nskilled migrants from these three countries.\n\nIn Cambodia, Thai skilled migrants accounted for \na sizable share of the total migrant population\u2014\nnearly 18%.

According to government and \ninformal estimates, the number of foreigners has \ngrown across most occupations, in both cities and \nrural areas.

Directional Shift among  \nInternational Students\n\nA similar trend is evident among international \nstudents. Although the majority of ASEAN \nstudents still leave the region for Western countries \n(particularly Australia, the United States, and \nthe United Kingdom) and Japan, the number of \ninternational students seeking higher education in the \nASEAN countries (and Asia more generally) has also \nbeen on the rise over the past decade. This is in large \npart due to Asia\u2019s increasingly strong role in the global \neconomy and in international education.77 Foreign \nstudents from Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, \nin particular, were likely to choose other ASEAN \ncountries for their higher education, especially \nMalaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam (see Table 15).\n\nASEAN countries have widely varying patterns \nof intraregional student mobility. In 2013, \nASEAN students accounted for 75% of the 2,500 \ninternational students in Viet Nam, 28% of the \n20,300 international students in Thailand, and 15% \nof the 40,500 international students in Malaysia \n(see\u00a0Table\u00a016, left panel). However, few international \nstudents from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and \nViet Nam study in ASEAN countries (under 5% each; \nsee Table 16, right panel).78\n\nAmong ASEAN countries, Lao PDR stands out. The \nmajority of its 543 international students are from \nASEAN, while more than half of students from Lao \nPDR study in other ASEAN countries. The flows \nof foreign students within ASEAN seem to reflect \nestablished corridors.

One such \nstep is the signing of various MRAs to \npromote the intraregional mobility of professionals. \nAnother is the expansion of educational \ninfrastructure. Underlying both of these is a growing \nawareness of the important role that foreign \nprofessionals play in regional economic growth.\n\na.   growing awareness  \n\nof the role and importance  \nof Foreign professionals\n\nRegional demand for high-skilled workers could \ngrow by 41%, an increase of 14 million workers, \nbetween 2010 and 2025.82 Across the ASEAN region, \nvarious stakeholders are becoming increasingly \naware of the importance of foreign professionals in \nfacilitating brain circulation and promoting economic \nprosperity in the region. In fact, attracting foreign \ntalent has become a priority for many governments, \npostsecondary education institutions, and private \nsector stakeholders such as employers and \nprofessional associations.\n\nRegional and international employers are interested \nin the intra-ASEAN movement of professionals as \nan important element of regional integration and \neconomic growth. The ASEAN Confederation of \nEmployers (ACE) is among the most active voices in \nthis regard. As part of the ASEAN TRIANGLE Project \n(ATP), ACE participated in national- and regional-\nlevel policy meetings throughout the region to discuss \nlabor mobility and the role of employers.83 \n\nA 2015 WEF report focusing on human capital re-\nemphasized the importance of skilled workers. Based \non a survey of employers around the world, WEF \nassessed the ease with which they can find skilled \nemployees, and noted considerable variation across \nASEAN countries (see Figure 12). Finding skilled \nemployees was easiest in Malaysia\u2014more so than in \nany other ASEAN country, or even most countries \nin the world. Of the 124 countries examined by \nthe report, Malaysia ranked fourth. Singapore, \nPhilippines, and Indonesia were placed farther \ndown the list at 20th, 35th, and 37th, respectively, \nbut still occupied the upper fourth of the global \nrankings. In contrast, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao \nPDR, and Myanmar were in the bottom sixth, with \nMyanmar ranked second to last.84 This shows a clear \ndivide among Member States on a point of critical \nimportance to employers in the region.\n\nLike regional employers, multinational corporations, \nwhich routinely move staff internationally, are keenly \naware of the value that foreign workers add to their \nbusinesses. According to the ASEAN Business Outlook \nSurvey 2016, 48% of U.S. business executives cited \nlabor mobility as a priority to enhance economic \nregional integration in the future, after nontariff barriers \nto trade, transparency, and good governance.85 In \nCambodia, 67% of U.S. business executives cited \nlack of skilled manpower as a top barrier to attracting \nnew investors to the country, tied with high energy \ncosts.

For instance, \nthe Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) reported \nthat Malaysia had 30,300 accountants (of whom \n120 were foreign professionals) serving a population \nof 30\u00a0million as of 2014, compared to 27,000 in \nSingapore serving a much smaller population of \n5\u00a0million.86 The institute considers the overall number \nof accountants in the country dramatically low and \nidentifies foreign accountants as an important talent \npool that will allow Malaysian accounting and auditing \nfirms to meet the demand for finance professionals.87 \n\nOf all stakeholders, governments are perhaps most \naware of the importance of foreign professionals. One \nstrategy for expanding this talent pool is to stimulate \nthe return of high-skilled diaspora members. Following \nthe success of Taipei,China and India in engaging their \ndiasporas, the Malaysian government has reached out \nto skilled Malaysians and entrepreneurs abroad.88 The \n\nSingaporean government, meanwhile, used visa and \ncitizenship policies to regulate the flow and type of \nworkers. While the country relies on foreign workers at \nboth the high and low ends of the labor spectrum, since \n2000, Singapore has specifically expanded channels \nthrough which various groups of foreign professionals \nand entrepreneurs can explore economic opportunities \nin the country. The government has also made it easier \nfor skilled foreigners (but not low-skilled ones) to gain \npermanent residency and citizenship.89 By building a \nreputation as an English-speaking country with high \neducational standards, technological prowess, and a \nhigh quality of life, Singapore has been successful in \nattracting large numbers of international students not \nonly from ASEAN countries but also from People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, India, and other countries.90\n\nB.   signing of Mutual recognition \n\narrangements \n\nAt the regional level, ASEAN policymakers envision \nMRAs as critical tools for encouraging the mobility of \nprofessionals under the AEC and for stemming the \n\n86  MIA, Opening Minds, Embracing Change: Annual Report 2014 (Kuala \nLumpur: MIA, 2014), www.mia.org.my/ar/2014/downloads/\nMalaysianInstituteofAccountantsAnnualReport2014.pdf. \n\n87  MIA, Evolving to Lead. \n88  World Bank, Improving the Effectiveness of the TalentCorp\u2019s Initiatives. \n\n89  Yeoh and Lin, \u201cRapid Growth in Singapore\u2019s Immigrant Population;\u201d \nMadeleine Sumption, \u201cVisas for Entrepreneurs: How Countries Are \nSeeking out Immigrant Job Creators,\u201d Migration Information Source, \n13\u00a0June 2012, www.migrationpolicy.org/article/visas-entrepreneurs-\nhow-countries-are-seeking-out-immigrant-job-creators. \n\n90  Yeoh and Lin, \u201cRapid Growth in Singapore\u2019s Immigrant Population.\u201d\n\n\f32\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\nemigration of highly skilled persons from the region.91 \nBetween 2005 and 2014, MRAs were signed for seven \nprofessions\u2014engineering (2005), nursing (2006), \narchitecture (2007), medicine and dentistry (2009), \ntourism professionals (2012), and accounting (2014). \nA framework arrangement for an MRA on professional \nsurveyors was also signed in 2007. \n\ntable 17: engineers and architects listed in \nasean-level registers, by Country\n\nengineers\n\narchitects\n\nnumber\n1,483\n2\n\n% of \ntotal number\n100.0\n0.1\n\n301\n1\n\n% of \ntotal\n100.0\n0.3\n\ntotal\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nCritically, the implementation of some of these \narrangements, including those for health-care \nprofessionals, is lagging.92 Efforts to register \nprofessionals with ASEAN-level councils and collect \n(and report) needed data have not progressed \nuniformly.

Challenges in MRA Implementation\n\nDo MRAs actually promote the mobility of skilled \npersons? Fukunaga argues that they are constrained \nby immigration regulations.94  The \u201creal test of \nmobility\u201d is whether registration systems, such as that \nfor the Registered Foreign Architects (RFA), are set \nup and used by prospective workers and employers.95 \nThe results so far are mixed; for example, only five \ncountries have established rules and procedures to \ncreate an RFA registration system.96 \n\nThat said, entry into an ASEAN-level registry is not \nenough: processing times are long and access to \ndestination-country labor markets is often tightly \nregulated by domestic laws. The experience of one \nexpert in the engineering field, a Filipino national, is \nhighly instructive: although he was able to register \n\n91  Bambang Susantono, \u201cStemming the Flow of ASEAN\u2019S Brain Drain,\u201d \nThe Nation, 7 October 2015, www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/\nStemming-the-flow-of-Aseans-brain-drain-30270341.html. \nImplementation of the ASEAN MRAs is explored in more depth in \nanother report in this series.

Then, when he sought \nto practice in Malaysia, he had to submit original \ncopies of all required documents\u2014despite the fact \nthat he had already gone through the vetting process \nat the regional level. His experiences highlight the \nchallenges that ASEAN engineers typically face in \nseeking to practice abroad.97\n\nFieldwork and interviews conducted for this study \nindicate that the intraregional skilled mobility facilitated \nby MRAs is rather minimal to date. For example, Thai \nparticipants in a roundtable discussion on skilled \nmobility mentioned that 24 Thai engineers and five \nThai architects were registered appropriately, but none \nhad moved to work in another ASEAN country.98 \n\nResponses to Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2013\nMPI questionnaires99 and evidence cited by focus \ngroup participants make it clear that multinational \ncompanies serve as the main vehicle for the mobility \nof foreign accountants, engineers, and medical \nprofessionals, either through direct employment \nor intracompany transfers. Direct employment was \ncited by nearly all national consultants100 as the main \nroute for migrants who arrive either for temporary \nemployment or for permanent residence. Examples of \nintracompany transfers include: \n\n \u0242 Vietnamese and Chinese clinics that opened \nin Lao PDR along shared national borders and \nbrought their own doctors and nurses\n\n \u0242 Thai engineers who worked in Myanmar building \n\na deep-sea port (the Dawei Port project)\n\n \u0242 General managers in high-end (and generally \nforeign-owned) hotels in Cambodia who are \n\n97  Participant comment during the Bali Forum on Skill Mobility in ASEAN, \n\norganized by ADB and MPI, Bali, 28\u201329 September 2015.\n\n98  Participant comments during an ADB-MPI roundtable discussion on \n\u201cDeveloping a Country Action Plan to Progress on Skill Mobility in \nASEAN under the AEC,\u201d Bali, 29 September 2015.\n\n99  National consultants were asked to select among 11 possible \n\nanswers the following question: \u201cThrough which of the following visa \nchannels are the foreign nationals in a given occupation most likely to \nmigrate for temporary work/for permanent residence?\u201d The options \nwere direct employment, recruitment agencies, student/scholars, \nfamily, government exchanges, refugees, tourists, business visitors/\nentrepreneurs, undocumented, intracompany transferees, and other.\n\n100  No data were reported for Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nnearly exclusively from Malaysia, Singapore, \nand Thailand\n\n \u0242 Accountants who work across ASEAN through \n\nmultinational corporations such as Price \nWaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte.\n\nThere is also some evidence that professionals and \nother high-skilled people use non-work-related visas to \nenter destination countries with the goal of obtaining \nemployment. An MPI study found that most high-\nskilled workers left the Philippines for the United Arab \nEmirates as tourists.101 Anecdotal evidence suggests \nthe same pattern for Filipino and other nationals in \nSingapore.102 This route allows individuals to bypass \ngovernment recruitment programs (which are time-\nconsuming and costly) and the need to look for an \nemployer that can sponsor them for an intracompany \ntransfer or other employment visa. ASEAN and \nnon-ASEAN professionals who are sponsored by \nmultinational corporations or use an irregular channel \ndo not need to register or pass national exams to \npractice and are generally not captured in migration \nand professional association data. As such, the extent \nof mobility and the scale of underemployment in the \nregion are hard to assess.\n\n2.   Looking Ahead\n\nDespite powerful and competing trends\u2014such \nas attractive options in OECD countries, the use \nof the intracompany transfer channels in lieu of \nMRAs, registration glitches, and obstacles to labor \nmarket access\u2014there is a broad consensus that \nMRAs are likely to play a positive role in promoting \nintraregional skilled mobility in the medium term \n(5\u201310 years) and beyond (more than 10 years). For \ninstance, MRAs might promote the mobility of Thai \nmedical professionals in both directions, with Thai \ndoctors (including Thai-trained foreign doctors) \nmoving to private hospitals in Cambodia, Lao PDR, \nand Myanmar under private hospital networks, and \na greater number of doctors from these countries \nbeing hired to provide health-care services to migrant \ncommunities at the border.103 Similarly, neuro- and \n\n101  Mendoza, Shortage amid Surplus.\n102  Participant comments during a focus group discussion organized by \n\nADB and MPI, Manila, 3 September 2015.\n\n103  Participant comment during a focus group discussion organized by ADB \n\nand MPI, Manila, 4 September 2015.\n\n\f34\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\ncardiosurgeons from Malaysia, the Philippines, and \nSingapore are expected to work at international \nprivate hospitals, while other medical specialists will \nbe invited to do research in public hospitals.\n\nThe promise of MRAs is particularly strong in the \ntourism sector, given its relatively straightforward \ncredential-recognition process, and the growing and \nimmediate demand for tourism professionals. The \nWorld Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) affirms \nthe importance of tourism to the ASEAN region as \na whole as well as to individual Member States. The \ntourism sector accounts for 4% of all jobs in the ASEAN \nregion and about 5% of regional gross domestic product \n(GDP).104 The WTTC projects the tourism sector to \nbe critical to the long-term growth of most ASEAN \ncountries. MRAs are likely to open a door for English-\nspeaking tourism professionals from Myanmar and \nthe Philippines105 to emigrate to Cambodia, Lao PDR, \nThailand, and Viet Nam, which all aim to expand \ntheir tourism industries as part of strategic economic \ndevelopment plans. \n\nIf MRAs are fully implemented for tourism and other \nprofessions, there is potential for an increase in \nmobility. A tentative estimate of how many people \nmight move under the MRA process in ASEAN in a \nyear can be attempted by drawing on MRA experiences \nworldwide. Arguably, the mutual recognition system in \nthe European Union (EU) is one of the most advanced, \ngiven its long history, the powers vested to European \ninstitutions, the significant resources allocated to its \ndevelopment and implementation, and its coverage of \nmore than 380 professions. The EU MRAs also cover \na large number of countries with diverse languages \nand differing levels of education and work experience \nrequirements. For these reasons, it is closer to what \nASEAN is developing than other MRA systems (e.g., \nbetween Australia and New Zealand). \n\nTo estimate future mobility in ASEAN, this report uses \nEurostat data on the number of persons engaged in \nall EU professions and European Commission data \non how many EU professionals apply annually for \n\nrecognition of their qualifications for the purpose of \npermanent establishment in another EU country. \n\nTable 18 lists the steps used in estimating the number \nof people in ASEAN who might move under the \nMRA process. As noted in column A, an average \nof about 37.8 million professionals were employed \nin the European Union in the 2010\u20132014 period. \nOn average, 53,000 applications were made to \nrecognize professional qualifications for the purpose \nof permanent establishment within the EU Member \nStates (column B), or 0.14% of the total employed \nprofessionals (column C).106 Using the 0.14% annual \napplication average from the European Union and \nassuming that MRAS are fully implemented in the \nASEAN as they are in the European Union, it can \nbe estimated that 20,920 professionals (column \nD) would apply for recognition under MRAs with \nthe intent to move (i.e., 0.14% of the 14.9 million \nprofessionals employed in seven MRA-covered \noccupations in ASEAN).\n\nIs this number big or small? The 20,920 figure can be \ninterpreted in a number of ways. On the one hand, if \n20,920 professionals start moving annually, it would \nstill be far higher than the current number of zero. It \nbears repeating that even a small absolute number of \nforeign professionals in high-demand sectors can make \nit easier to provide critical services, as the example of \nmedical professionals in Lao PDR demonstrates. On \nthe other hand, the estimate reflects first and foremost \nthe outcomes in the European Union. Given that the \nmobility of persons is a right, professionals are able to \ncross borders seamlessly, establish themselves, and \nwork in other EU countries. In contrast, the progress \nof MRA implementation in ASEAN has been slow and \nhas to overcome multiple barriers, such as visa and \nemployment requirements. Considering the depth of \nMRA implementation in the European Union, even \nthis modest estimate of annual flows in ASEAN may be \noptimistic, at least in the near term. Alternatively, the \nestimate may be overly conservative: the EU figures \nare based on more than 380 professions, and tourism \nprofessionals make up a relatively small portion of \nthose who move. In contrast, given ASEAN\u2019s large size, \n\n104  World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), \u201cWTTC Data Gateway,\u201d \n\naccessed 1 July 2016, www.wttc.org/datagateway/; WTTC, \n\u201cEconomic Impact Analysis,\u201d accessed 1 July 2016, www.wttc.org/\nresearch/economic-research/economic-impact-analysis/. \n\n105  Ibid.\n\n106  To calculate the 0.14%, the ratio of the number of mutual recognition \n\napplicants over the total number of professionals in the European Union \nwas taken for every year between 2010 and 2014.

ASEAN \npolicymakers understand that international students \npave the way for high-skilled mobility. The regional \nimpact of this is likely to grow as increasing numbers \nof Asian students choose to remain in Asia for their \nuniversity studies. Growing the number of international \nstudents from the region is an important way for \nASEAN to promote skills circulation. The driving \nforces behind this expansion are the ASEAN University \nNetwork (AUN), the Southeast Asian Ministers of \nEducation Organization (SEAMEO), and the ASEAN \nQualifications Recognition Framework (AQRF).\n\nAUN is composed of 30 universities that work together \nto foster the development of the region.108 Using the \nASEAN Credit Transfer System, students are able to \nstudy at universities throughout the region and receive \ncredit at their home university. Moreover, ASEAN \nscholarships help to encourage study abroad within \nthe region. Networks have been established among \nthe universities to promote studies in certain areas, \nincluding business and economics, human rights \neducation, health promotion, and social responsibility \nand sustainability. Perhaps most pertinent to the \nregion is the development of an ASEAN studies course \nthat focuses on the study of ASEAN as \u201ca political \ninstitution and as a process through which the peoples \nand cultures of the region are brought into increasing \ninteraction.\u201d109 One of the goals of this course \n(and of AUN more broadly) is to contribute to the \ndevelopment of ASEAN professionals who will be at \nease navigating the region.\n\nSEAMEO complements the AUN work by promoting \nand facilitating the movement of students in \n\n107  See Dovelyn Rannveig Mendoza, Demetrios G.

Data needs and Priorities  \nfor informed Policymaking\n\nAs has been noted several times, accurate, \n\ncomprehensive, and timely data on skilled \nprofessionals in both origin and destination \n\ncountries in ASEAN are hard to obtain. While \ndata alone cannot provide policymakers with \nthe vision and experience needed to achieve the \nambitious goals of skilled mobility, high-quality \ndata are essential for understanding the trends \nin the region and bringing about the necessary \npolicy changes. They are also needed to gain the \nsupport of citizens, employers, professional groups, \ngovernment officials, and other key stakeholders.119 \n\nAccording to the fieldwork conducted to inform this \nreport, both ASEAN countries and international \nbodies are committed to creating comprehensive, \nreal-time data-collection systems for use in domestic \nand regional decision-making. This section discusses \nwhat national and ASEAN policymakers will need to \nknow to manage skilled mobility and minimize the \npermanent loss (brain drain) and underutilization \n(brain waste) of valuable human capital. Several \nobstacles are identified, and recommendations on \nhow to address them are offered.\n\nCast a broad data net to better understand flows \nof migrant professionals. The following groups of \nwould-be migrants should be taken into account \nalongside professionals listed in ASEAN registers.\n\n119  Ravichandran Moorthy and Guido Benny, \u201cIs an \u2018ASEAN Community\u2019 \nAchievable?\u201d Asian Survey 52, no. 6 (2012): 1043\u201366, www.jstor.\norg/stable/10.1525/as.2012.52.6.1043; Guntur Sugiyarto and \nDovelyn Rannveig Agunias, A \u201cFreer\u201d Flow of Skilled Labour within \nASEAN: Aspirations, Opportunities, and Challenges in 2015 and Beyond \n(Bangkok and Washington, DC: IOM and MPI), www.migrationpolicy.\norg/research/freer-flow-skilled-labour-within-asean-aspirations-\nopportunities-and-challenges-2015. \n\n \u0242 Professionals who move for work through \n\nnonemployment channels. Government data \non the number of migrant workers, organized by \noccupation, capture only those who go through \nthe formal employment system. Meanwhile, \nmany professionals and highly skilled individuals \neasily bypass this system through irregular \nchannels (e.g., by entering another country as \ntourists).120\n\n \u0242 Professionals who move for work through non-\nMRA channels. Focus group participants noted \nthat most professionals move to other ASEAN \ncountries with multinational corporations rather \nthan through MRA channels. Their movements \nare not captured by either ASEAN registers or \nprofessional groups in destination countries.\n\n \u0242 Migrants who make multiple sequential moves. \nWhile some professionals may directly move to \ntheir final destination, many will pursue a step-\nmigration strategy. For example, many health-\ncare professionals first start with a temporary \nemployment contract in one destination country \nbefore moving on to another. \n\n \u0242 Domestic and foreign graduates qualified \n\nin the MRA-covered professions. This group \nrepresents an important pool of potential workers \navailable to work in a given ASEAN country. \nFor instance, the small but growing number of \nASEAN students studying medicine and dentistry \nin Thailand will have a much easier time passing \nthe professional exams (including the language \ntest) after graduation and some may even choose \nto remain in Thailand. As policymakers at the \n\n120  Mendoza, Shortage amid Surplus.\n\n37\n\n\f38\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\nlocal and regional level attempt to estimate the \noccupational supply and demand and to influence \nthe level and direction of the movement of \ngraduates in various MRA professions, better \ninformation is essential. \n\ntrack data on brain drain and brain waste. OECD \ndata on the emigration of highly educated persons \nfrom the ASEAN region to OECD destinations seem to \nsupport concerns among ASEAN countries about brain \ndrain. ASEAN governments would benefit from a better \nunderstanding of why ASEAN professionals choose to \nemigrate. Relevant data can be collected through regular \nsurveys or, at minimum, at the time of border crossing. \nThe Australian data-collection system provides a good \nmodel. All persons entering or leaving Australia are \nasked a battery of migration-related questions, including \non their country of birth and nationality, origin/\ndestination, intended/actual length of residence, and \nreasons for moving.121 \n\nSimilarly, both Canada and Australia use survey data \nto identify key risk factors, and use this information to \ncounter brain waste among immigrants. Governments \ncollecting information on the degrees obtained and \nprofessions practiced before and after migration are able \nto assess the extent of mismatch between immigrants\u2019 \npast and present employment.\n\nDevelop data to support decisionmaking. Collecting \ndata to inform policy is a challenging task for technical, \nfinancial, institutional, as well as political reasons, as \nan example from the Philippines demonstrates. Even \nwith a legal mandate to set up a Shared Government \nInformation System on Migration (1995), the system \nhas not been fully implemented, in part because of \nlack of funding, but also because of turf wars between \ngovernment agencies that oversee different aspects \nof overseas labor migration.122 Canada, on the other \n\n121  Graeme Hugo, Janet Wall, and Margaret Young, The Southeast \n\nAsia-Australia Regional Migration System: Some Insights into the \u201cNew \nEmigration\u201d (Washington, DC: MPI, 2015), www.migrationpolicy.org/\nresearch/southeast-asia-australia-regional-migration-system-some-\ninsights-new-emigration.\n\n122  Maruja Asis, \u201cTowards a Shared Government Information System \n\nfor Migration: A Possible Dream?\u201d (presentation, National Statistics \nConference, Mandaluyong City, Philippines, 1\u20132 October 2013), \nwww.nscb.gov.ph/ncs/12thncs/papers/INVITED/IPS-32%20\nDemographic%20Statistics%20(Migration)/IPS-32_2%20Towards%20\na%20Shared%20Government%20Information%20System%20for%20\nMigration_%20A%20Possible%20Dream.pdf. \n\nhand, offers an example of how a country uses its \ndata collection and analysis to make better decisions. \nA pioneer of the points-based system that prioritizes \nskilled immigration, Canada has made regular \nadjustments in the allocation of points to applicants\u2019 \ncharacteristics (e.g., language skills, degrees, and age) \nwhen government and independent research revealed \nlackluster economic outcomes among a significant \nnumber of new arrivals.

The nexus \nbetween professional and student mobility also calls \nfor collecting regional-level data on the movement of \nstudents after graduation, the rate and timing of their \nreturn, the distribution of the costs of higher degree \neducation between the home and host countries, \nand contributions to the regional community through \ndiaspora effects. \n\ntap into existing data-collection efforts outside \nthe migration field. Governments in the region do \nnot need to build mobility data systems from scratch. \nFor instance, the World Values Survey (WVS) and the \nGallup World Poll, two international public opinion \nsurveys, provide a unique avenue for potential data-\ncollection efforts. They already collect data in ASEAN \nMember States and use region-specific questions, \nsuch as respondents\u2019 sentiments toward ASEAN as an \norganization alongside their national government and \nother groups. Most important, both WVS and Gallup are \nopen to including new questions to supplement existing \ndata. In the short term, adding relevant questions to \nexisting surveys could be the most fruitful way to collect \nvaluable data on high-skilled and MRA-covered mobility \nin ASEAN (see other international datasets in Table 19).\n\nCollect data on Mra-covered occupations. As \npointed out earlier, no countries or international \norganizations have consistent and reliable data \ndetailed enough to identify the mobility of skilled \npersons in the MRA-covered professions. Data on \ntourism professionals are particularly limited, as the \n32 professions covered by the MRA represent a mix of \nhigh-, middle-, and low-skilled occupations.\n\nsupport regional efforts in creating data-\ncollection systems. Finally, collecting and analyzing \nlarge, complex, and real-time data can be extremely \n\n\fData needs and Priorities for informed Policymaking\n\n39\n\nchallenging for countries that lack technical and \nmethodological expertise. Creating new and modifying \nexisting data systems are costly and time-consuming \nprocesses.

Many challenges \nremain, including an ongoing pattern of brain \n\u201closs\u201d to OECD countries, newly emerging patterns \nof brain waste within the region, and technical \nchallenges to implementing relevant MRAs. Further, \nthe MRAs may not in themselves be enough to \nfacilitate the goal of high-skilled mobility. This \nstudy estimates that only 20,920 professionals of \nthe 14.9 million persons employed in the seven \nMRA-covered occupations in ASEAN might move \nthrough the MRA process in the near future. \n\nWhile the AEC offers an opportunity to build and \nshare wealth collectively, it also requires coordinated \npolicies between countries to address these \nchallenges. A series of concrete steps at the regional \nand national levels could be taken now to realize the \npotential that greater skilled mobility offers.\n\na.   regional level: the need for \n\nQuality Data and policy analysis\n\nThe many gaps in knowledge on the scale, \ncomposition, and direction of high-skilled workers\u2019 \nmovements could be filled through improved data \ncollection and continuous policy-relevant analysis.\n\n1.   Generating Quality Data on Skilled \n\nMobility in ASEAN\n\nAs countries build up and expand their institutional \ndata and analytical capacity, data-collection systems \nestablished in other countries and regions for policy-\nrelevant analysis can be used as models. A highly \nuseful publication for policy research is the annual \nOECD report, International Migration Outlook \n(referred to as SOPEMI). The report is chock-full of \nthe most recent and historical trend data on flows, \nstocks, origins, and destinations, as well as a broad \nrange of characteristics and outcomes for both \nmigrants and nationals for the OECD overall, the \nindividual Member States, and more recently, select \nnon-OECD countries. Each report provides details \non participating countries\u2019 data-collection methods, \ngroup inclusions and exclusions, and the changes that \ntake place over time to help data analysts interpret \nthe reported information correctly. OECD also \nattempts to harmonize the data across its Member \nStates and provides technical assistance for countries \nrevising or building their data systems. Additionally, \nevery year the report covers two or three topical \nissues that are of particular interest to policymakers.\n\nModeled on the OECD report, the Organization \nfor American States (OAS) launched a similar \npublication, International Migration in the Americas \n(referred as SICREMI). Now in its third edition, it \naims to disseminate data that are otherwise hard to \nobtain and analyze.123 Though less extensive than the \nOECD Outlook, it describes the magnitude, trends, \n\n123  Organization of American States (OAS) and OECD, International \nMigration in the Americas: Third Report of the Continuous Reporting \nSystem on International Migration in the Americas (SICREMI) 2015 \n(Washington, DC: OAS, 2015), www.oas.org/docs/publications/\nSICREMI-2015-ENGLISH.pdf.\n\n40\n\n\fmoving forward toward skill mobility\n\n41\n\nand characteristics of international migration in the \ncountries of the Americas. SOPEMI and SICREMI \noffer good models for the ASEAN countries to \nemulate. And funders of international development \nwould do well to support similar measures. Necessary \ntechnical assistance could be coordinated by \nindependent, international research organizations.\n\n2.   Developing Forward-Looking Policy \n\nRegarding MRAs\n\nof ASEAN Member States have large populations \nof children and youth who are in or about to enter \nprimary and secondary schools, an increasing share \nof whom will pursue some form of postsecondary \neducation. In addition, practically all ASEAN \ncountries have growing expatriate communities as \na result of sustained work, family, and humanitarian \nmigration flows. Foreign teachers can thus provide \neducational services to both the general population \nand to linguistic minorities.125 \n\nParallel to this report, which focuses on trends in \nthe mobility of skilled persons overall and in MRA-\ncovered occupations in particular, the Migration \nPolicy Institute has conducted extensive analyses of \nthe technical and policy challenges that complicate \neffective MRA implementation124 as well as \nan exploration of the best ways to address \nthese challenges for the current MRA-covered \nprofessions. One lesson to consider here is the \nneed to think proactively about the next profession \nor set of professions for which an MRA could be \ndeveloped. \n\nResearch shows that it takes time, more than a \ndecade in some cases, to lay the foundation for, \nsign, and then implement an MRA. Furthermore, it \ntakes time for professionals and other stakeholders \nto learn about and start taking advantage of the \nopportunities that an MRA can offer. There is also a \ntime lag between the initial discussions of an MRA \nfor a given profession and when it starts being a \nreal facilitator of the mobility of the professionals \ncovered. This means that policymakers would need \nto make their decisions based on projected supply \nand demand for skills in each occupation 10 to 15 \nyears into the future. \n\nMatching the supply of skilled labor with demand \non a regional basis will be critical not only for the \nsuccess of the ASEAN Confederation of Employers \nbut also for addressing brain drain and brain waste. \nTeaching is one profession that is likely to benefit \nfrom an MRA. As described in Section II, a number \n\n124  Mendoza and Sugiyarto, The Long Road Ahead; Dovelyn Rannveig \nMendoza, Maria Vincenza Desiderio, Guntur Sugiyarto, and Brian \nSalant, Open Windows, Closed Doors: Mutual Recognition Arrangements \non Professional Services in the ASEAN Region (Manila: ADB, \nforthcoming).\n\nConstruction professionals might also be benefited \nby an MRA. For most ASEAN countries and for the \nregion overall, tourism represents\u2014and is widely \nprojected to remain\u2014a critical source of domestic \nemployment, and also accounts for a significant share \nof GDP. As countries invest in their tourism-related \ninfrastructures (e.g., roads, hotels, restaurants, \nand entertainment centers), the need to promote \nharmonization of the knowledge, skills, and codes of \npractice for construction professionals and workforces \nacross ASEAN is likely to increase. Three construction-\nrelated professionals\u2014architects, engineers, and \nsurveyors\u2014are already covered by an MRA or a \nframework arrangement. However, similar to their \ntourism counterparts, construction workers with \nmid- and lower-level skills might also benefit from \ngreater mobility opportunities. MRAs could facilitate \na standardized curriculum, harmonized professional \nrequirements, and an ASEAN-level certification.\n\nB.   national level: addressing \n\nCommon Challenges to Brain \nCirculation\n\nA key finding of this report is that despite economic \ndisparities, both relatively advanced countries (such \nas Singapore) and less developed ones (such as \nMyanmar and Lao PDR) need skilled foreigners to fill \nshortages. Put differently, no ASEAN country can be \nself-sufficient when it comes to talent. Furthermore, \nand unlike in the past, professionals are moving to a \nrange of countries within ASEAN, not just to the most \nwealthy. These concurrent trends suggest that ASEAN \nMember States may increasingly both send and receive \nskilled persons. To do so efficiently, they will need to \naddress a number of common challenges, such as:\n\n125  Sumption, Tackling Brain Waste. \n\n\f42\n\nfiring up regional Brain networks\n\n \u0242 Tackling brain waste. Despite the \nobvious human capital and broader \neconomic implications of brain waste, the \nunderutilization of both domestic and foreign \nworker skills is an understudied issue across \nASEAN countries. Skills underutilization is \none of the main reasons many highly educated \npeople emigrate, and understanding the \nreasons for it is important. Today\u2019s immigrants \nbring with them much greater human \ncapital as well as greater work and education \nexperience than those in the past. If their skills \ngo unrecognized, they may be trapped in the \ninformal market.  \n \nLack of data makes it is extremely difficult \nto assess the extent or costs associated \nwith brain waste, but the phenomenon is \nunquestionably real. ASEAN is not alone \nin facing this challenge. One of the lessons \nto be learned from other countries is that \nreducing MRA-related barriers is not enough. \nAustralia, Canada, the EU Member States, \nand to a lesser extent the United States have \nexperimented with various strategies and \npractical solutions for reducing barriers to \nhuman capital transfer. Led by both public \nand private organizations and agencies, these \nmodels have included efforts to help foreign \nprofessionals bridge the gaps between their \nskills and domestic requirements, to simplify \nqualifications requirements, to provide \ninformation and support to newcomers as \nthey navigate the domestic labor market and \nprofessional regulations, and to expand access \nto language training.126\n\n \u0242 Monitoring brain drain trends. A worldwide \nphenomenon, brain drain has long been \non the policy and political agenda of many \ngovernments because of its potential to \nadversely affect a country\u2019s development \n\nand economic growth. More recent \nresearch suggests, however, that the \nnegative consequences of the emigration \nof skilled and highly educated persons may \nbe offset by certain positive effects, such \nas remittances and the transfer of other \nresources that diasporas often contribute to \ntheir home countries. Examples from India, \nRepublic of Korea, and Taipei,China, among \nmany others, show that a skilled diaspora \nrepresents a key strategic asset that could \nrespond to the developmental needs of \nhome countries by seeding new businesses, \npromoting international trade, and facilitating \ntechnology transfers.127 It is essential to not \nonly monitor outflows of skilled people but \nalso understand the main reasons skilled \nASEAN nationals choose to emigrate from \ntheir countries (or from the region more \nbroadly), the reasons they may choose not to \nreturn, and ways to leverage the support of \nthe diaspora for developmental needs. \n\n \u0242 Involving multiple stakeholders in the \n\nprocess. Reducing barriers to the movement \nof the highly skilled requires commitment \nand coordinated efforts from a wide range \nof stakeholders with possibly competing \npriorities. These actors include local, regional, \nand international employers; professional \nassociations; governments and regulatory \nauthorities; educational institutions; \nservice providers; as well as the general \npublic. Though awareness of the presence \nand importance of foreign professionals is \nincreasing, the general consensus among \ninternational and regional experts is that more \nneeds to be done. At this juncture, it is critical \nto promote the benefits of MRAs in particular \nand skilled migration in general through \npublic education campaigns and ongoing \nconsultations with key stakeholders.      \n\n126  Anke Schuster, Maria Vincenza Desiderio, and Giuliana Urso, eds., \nRecognition of Qualifications and Competences of Migrants (Belgium: \nInternational Organization for Migration, 2013), https://publications.\niom.int/books/recognition-qualifications-and-competences-migrants.\n\n127 \n\n Papademetriou, Rethinking Emigration.\n\n\fappendixes\n\nappendix 1. asean employment in seven Mra-Covered professions:  \n\nsize and share of total employment, Various Years \n\nEmployment in MRA-Covered Professions\n\nShare of 7 \nProfessions \nin Total \nEmployment \n(%)\n4.5\n\nAccountingf Architecturef Dentistry Engineering Medical Nursing\n3,323c\n174c\n\n596c\n\n167f\n\n64\n\n56\n\nTourismf\n4,500\n\nTotal 7 \nProfessions\n8,880\n\nTotal \nEmploymente\n198,360\n\n1,034,500\n\n1,050,161\n\n8,732,507\n\n12.0\n\n291\n\n26,782\n\n101\n\n32,511\n\n630\n\n19,380\n\n24,774\n\n68,777\n\n9,800\n\n368\n\n6,000\n\n255\n\n1,900\n\n413\n\n36,000\n\n1,806\n\n2,600\n\n4,100\n\n284c\n24,147c\n225c\n9,995b\n3,355c\n45,903a\n2,149d\n17,222b\n811c\n\n2,440c\n11,454c\n824f\n49,853c 338,501c\n9,000d\n5,581c\n1,160c\n7,000e\n90,199b\n32,979b\n11,170d\n29,832c\n48,871c\n50d\n93,862a 488,434a\n14,250d\n10,339d\n30,533d\n4,333g\n26,244b 138,710b\n190,000f\n267,244e 107,867d 112,029d\n\n3,468,500\n\n3,931,374 117,786,355\n\n123,000\n\n574,000\n\n661,000\n\n137,322\n\n3,385,881\n\n752,754\n\n13,219,276\n\n744,151\n\n29,469,012\n\n1,264,500\n\n1,962,329\n\n41,357,455\n\n158,500\n\n232,434\n\n3,054,343\n\n2,402,500\n\n2,846,053\n\n39,859,396\n\n2,783,000\n\n3,284,851\n\n53,519,872\n\n3.3\n\n4.1\n\n5.7\n\n2.5\n\n4.7\n\n7.6\n\n7.1\n\n6.1\n\nBrunei \nDarussalam\n\nCambodia\n\nindonesia\n\nlao PDr\n\nmalaysia\n\nmyanmar\n\nPhilippines\n\nsingapore\n\nThailand\n\nViet nam\n\n53,506\n\n104,265\n\n504,038\n\n183,102\n\n355,172 1,267,635 12,474,000 14,941,718 310,582,456\n\nasean\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, MRA = mutual recognition arrangement. \nNote: Estimates are derived from different data sources and refer to various years: a2004, b2010, c2012, d2013, e2014, f2015, g2016.\nSources: Data on dentistry, medical, and nursing (including midwifery) professionals are from World Health Organization, \u201cGlobal Health Observatory \nData Repository,\u201d accessed 13 July 2016, http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1443?lang=en; Data on accountants are from ASEAN \nFederation of Accountants (AFA), Annual Report 2015 (Jakarta: AFA, 2016), www.aseanaccountants.org/files/AFA_Annual_Report_2015.pdf; Data \non architects are from ASEAN Architect Council, \u201cAAC 27 Comparative Matrix\u2014ASEAN Architect Council,\u201d accessed 13 July 2016, http://site.\naseanarchitectcouncil.org/main/3000/index.asp?pageid=167608&t=documents; Data on engineers are from ASEAN, Handbook on Liberalisation \nof Professional Services through Mutual Recognition in ASEAN: Engineering Services (Jakarta: The ASEAN Secretariat, 2015), www.asean.org/storage/\nimages/2015/september/ASEAN-Handbook-Architechture-Services/FINAL%20ASEAN%20Handbook%2001%20-%20Engineering%20Services.pdf; \nInstitution of Engineers Indonesia, \u201cInfografis: Komposisi Jumlah Insinyur (ASEAN Composition of Engineers),\u201d accessed 14 February 2016, http://\npii.or.id/infografis-komposisi-jumlah-insinyur-asean; Pertubuhan Ukur Jurutera & Arkitek, \u201cPUJA (Brunei) Membership List,\u201d accessed 13 July 2016, \nhttp://puja-brunei.org/memberships/memberlist/; Institution of Engineers Singapore, \u201cMember List (June 2016),\u201d accessed 13 July 2016, www.ies.\norg.sg/wordpressX/ies-members/; national consultants\u2019 responses to ADB-MPI questionnaires; Data on tourism are from World Travel and Tourism \nCouncil (WTTC), \u201cWTTC Data Gateway,\u201d accessed 1 July 2016, www.wttc.org/datagateway/; WTTC, \u201cEconomic Impact Analysis,\u201d accessed 1 July \n2016, www.wttc.org/research/economic-research/economic-impact-analysis/; Total employment data are from World Bank, \u201cWorld Development \nIndicators,\u201d accessed 13 July 2016, http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators.\n\n4.8\n\n43\n\n\f44\n\nappendix 2. research Questions and Methodology\n\nTo systematically examine cross-border talent flows \nwithin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \nthe research and fieldwork that informed this series of \nreports was organized around four sets of questions:\n\n \u0242 What is known and knowable about the \nmovement of postsecondary-educated \nindividuals in general as well as in the occupations \ncovered by mutual recognition arrangements? \n\n \u0242 What are the stocks and flows of ASEAN \nprofessionals, including in the MRA \noccupations? That is, what size are these \npopulations, where are they now, and where do \nthey come from? \n\n \u0242 What are the demographic, educational, labor, \nand other forces that are likely to affect future \nflows of skilled persons in ASEAN? What is the \npotential for migration-related growth in the \nMRA-covered occupations? \n\n \u0242 What information do policymakers need to \n\nhave in order to meaningfully estimate the scale, \nnature, and directions of high-skilled flows, and \nto address the challenges of skilled mobility \nsuch as brain drain and brain waste? What can \nthe ASEAN Member States learn from other \ncountries and regional organizations? \n\nAn initial literature and data scan on stocks and flows by \nprofession and country of origin and destination revealed \na field characterized by lack of information more broadly \n(e.g., certain data are not collected at all), lack of needed \ndetail on skilled professionals (e.g., information on \npracticing professionals is not broken down by nativity), \nand limited data access (e.g., some governments do not \nauthorize data access to nongovernment researchers). \nFaced with these data challenges, the research team \nadopted a multipronged approach. \n\nFirst, they identified and worked closely with data and \nmobility experts in each ASEAN country, who became \nvaluable resources on government and administrative \ndatasets, helping with data access, data interpretation, \nand translation (see Appendix 3 for a list of experts \ninvolved). They developed, tested, and administered \nthree data questionnaire instruments that were \ncompleted by the national consultants:\n\n \u0242 Questionnaire #1 asked respondents to \nprovide statistics and describe the main \ntrends and developments in the cross-country \nmovements of professionals in each of the MRA \noccupations drawing from government surveys \nand publications, professional organizations, \nregulatory commissions, registers, research \nsurveys, and other sources.\n\n \u0242 Questionnaire #2 asked respondents to \n\nprovide statistics and describe how the current \neducational, labor, and migration trends might \naffect the future mobility and directions of flows \nof persons studying for or employed in a given \noccupation.\n\n \u0242 Questionnaire #3 asked respondents to assess \n\nthe availability and quality of the data on domestic \nand foreign nationals working or studying in each \nof the MRA occupations.\n\nSecond, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \nMigration Policy Institute (MPI) convened two focus \ngroup discussions in Manila (3\u20134 September 2015) and \nBali (26\u201327 September 2015) with 57 key informants \nfrom ASEAN Member States as well as international \nexperts on highly skilled foreign workers that allowed us \nto probe more deeply into data questions relating to the \nsize, origins, and destinations of skilled professionals and \ninternational students; the facilitators and barriers to \ntheir movement; the projected demand in occupations \nunder MRAs; and access and quality of available data on \nskilled persons and students. Altogether, 105 local and \ninternational experts were engaged over the course of this \nstudy (see Appendix 3 for their names and affiliations).\n\nThird, existing data sources were scanned, especially \nthose collected by international organizations, such \nas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD); the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO); the World Bank; the World Health \nOrganization (WHO); the United Nations Educational, \nScientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); \nregional organizations such as the ASEAN TRIANGLE \nProject (ATP) and
