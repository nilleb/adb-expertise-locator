Close to 15 million \npeople in the region are employed in these professions, accounting for about 5% of total employment. \nUsing the application rates for professional recognition and mobility in the European Union as a proxy, \napproximately 20,920 professionals might apply annually for recognition under the ASEAN MRA system. \nThe ASEAN goal of encouraging intraregional mobility must be understood in the context of changing \npopulation dynamics, rising educational levels and aspirations, and increasingly dynamic\u2014if complex\u2014\neconomic forces. These so-called megaforces are poised to transform the supply, demand, and mobility of \nskilled professionals across ASEAN: \n\u0242  Diverging demographics. ASEAN represents a demographically diverse region. Some countries, such \nas Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, and Thailand, are projected to see their labor forces age and decline, \nresulting in a growing elderly population and a narrowing worker pipeline. By contrast, Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and the Philippines might continue to \nsee their labor forces grow over the next couple of decades. Taken together, these complementary \npressures are likely to encourage people of working age\u2014including the highly educated\u2014to move \nwithin the region.\n\u0242  Rising educational levels and aspirations. The changing skill and education levels of the population \nin the region will also affect the size and composition of migrant flows. In the past few decades, all \nASEAN countries have made large investments in secondary and tertiary education. Larger cohorts \nof ASEAN citizens with a vocational or college education mean a greater pool of skilled workers who \nare likely to migrate, given the right incentives. In addition, more students from ASEAN countries are \nseeking an international education. Unlike in the past, when a lack of education opportunities at home \ndrew many to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the \neducational aspirations of the new generation of students can be met regionally. \nvii", "viii executive summary\n\u0242  Continuing economic disparities and opportunities. Wide variation in economic opportunities in \nthe region has been and will remain the key driving force for migration across the skills continuum. The \n2007\u20132013 Gallup World Poll1 highlights two important observations about the mobility aspirations \nof skilled persons worldwide: they are almost twice as likely to intend to emigrate (19%) than those in \nlow-skilled occupations (10%), and they are more likely to have the means to do so. As rapid economic \ngrowth increases regional demand for the highly skilled, ASEAN Member States need to commit the \nnecessary capital and policy investments to attracting and retaining ever-larger shares of well-qualified \nworkers in the region.\nThe convergence of these megatrends represents unique opportunities for human capital development and \nbrain circulation within Southeast Asia. For low-income countries, such as Lao PDR, even a small increase \nin the absolute number of high-skilled foreigners can raise the number of needed professionals and expand \naccess to critical services. For middle-income countries, such as Malaysia, a greater number of highly skilled \nworkers might propel the nation toward becoming a high-income economy and thus avoid the middle-income \ntrap. Finally, the wealthiest ASEAN countries, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore, would benefit from tapping \nskilled regional talent to compensate for a declining labor supply and to sustain economic vitality and growth. \nThe promise of greater brain circulation depends on a proactive regional response to two pressing challenges: \nbrain waste and brain drain. \n\u0242  Brain waste is an understudied issue in ASEAN. More formally known as \u201cskills underutilization,\u201d \nbrain waste typically refers to persons working in jobs for which their education and work experience \noverqualify them. A classic case of brain waste is an experienced doctor or engineer driving a taxi. This \nsituation represents the worst of public policy outcomes: the human capital that newcomers bring \ninto a country slowly degrades, the destination country fails to harness their skills and talents, and the \ninvestments all parties have made are wasted.  \n \nWhile skills underutilization can be observed throughout the developed world, there is a lack of relevant \ndata or studies about it in the ASEAN context. For the most part, the phenomenon has been off the \nradar of regional policymakers. \n\u0242  Brain drain is a source of ongoing concern in ASEAN. Brain drain, or the emigration of highly \neducated individuals, has been recognized as a significant obstacle to economic and social development. \nSpecifically, the number of tertiary-educated ASEAN emigrants in OECD countries increased from \n1.7 million in 2000 to 2.8 million in 2010\u201311. The motivation to emigrate to OECD countries remains \nstrong: a powerful base of jobs and support networks makes it likely that skilled emigration from ASEAN \nto OECD will continue. \n \n1  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Connecting with Emigrants: A Global Profile of Diasporas 2015 (Paris: OECD \nPublishing, 2015), www.oecd.org/publications/connecting-with-emigrants-9789264239845-en.htm. ", "executive summary ix\nThere are opportunities to compensate for some of the negative effects of such emigration. In a globally \nconnected world, the departure of skilled nationals is neither necessarily permanent nor a net drain, \nat least in the long run. Many return with new skills, financial and social capital, and access to valuable \nbusiness and educational networks. Further, successful migrants abroad can \u201cact as social, cultural, and \neconomic ambassadors.\u201d2 Finally, remittances received from abroad can not only improve the economic \nfortunes of migrants\u2019 families but also support productive investments. \nDespite legitimate concerns about brain waste and brain drain, the prospects of more dynamic brain circulation \nwithin the Southeast Asia region, with associated benefits, remain good. \n\u0242  The regional brain network is expanding. Until now, most intra-ASEAN migrants have been low-\nskilled, temporary, and unauthorized. Today, the share of high-skilled regional migration is on the rise, \nfueled in large part by university students. Furthermore, a growing share of skilled persons are moving to \nother ASEAN countries (and not outside the region), including to those with income levels below Brunei \nDarussalam and Singapore. \n\u0242  Brain circulation is encouraged by a number of important developments. Three such \ndevelopments are particularly relevant: First, there is growing awareness that foreign professionals \nplay an important role in regional economic growth. Second, the ASEAN educational infrastructure is \nexpanding at rates that support the growth of student mobility in the region. Third, efforts to mutually \nrecognize professional qualifications are beginning to bear fruit. \nAgainst the backdrop of sweeping changes in the scale, composition, and direction of intraregional flows, \nASEAN is on the threshold of substantially expanding the regional mobility of the highly skilled. However, \nprogress could stall unless ASEAN Member States fully understand and address a number of challenges at \nboth the regional and national levels. \n\u0242  At the regional level, it is essential to improve data collection and make progress on the \nimplementation of signed MRAs. Lack of consistent, harmonized data across ASEAN countries \nand across the MRA-covered professions makes it difficult to track and influence skilled mobility and \nto counter brain drain and brain waste. Models of how to address these data needs and gaps exist in \nother countries and regions.3 The international development community could be asked to support an \nASEAN-level data-collection effort.  \n \n2  Demetrios G. Papademetriou, Rethinking Emigration: Turning Challenges into Opportunities (Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute, 2015),  \nwww.migrationpolicy.org/research/rethinking-emigration-turning-challenges-opportunities-transatlantic-council-statement. \n3  The OECD\u2019s annual publication, International Migration Outlook, is one such example. See OECD, International Migration Outlook 2016 (Paris: OECD \nPublishing, 2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/migr_outlook-2016-en. ", "x executive summary\nTo date, implementation of the MRAs has been slowed by many technical and institutional hurdles. \nWhile addressing these barriers, ASEAN policymakers would do well to think ahead about the next \ngeneration of arrangements covering other occupations the region may need, such as those for teachers \nand construction professionals. \n\u0242  At the national level, ASEAN Member States must deepen understanding of brain waste and \nbrain drain. This can be done by producing better data and involving a diverse range of stakeholders\u2014\nemployers, professional associations, government and regulatory authorities, education institutions, \nservice providers, and the general public\u2014in finding solutions. The reason to do so is both simple and \ncompelling: Given evident changes in the scale, composition, and direction of intraregional flows, all \nASEAN Member States will eventually be both origin and destination countries for skilled migrants. \nTherefore, challenges such as brain waste and brain drain will increasingly be relevant for all countries.

Hawthorne reported \nthat by 2014, in addition to the 10 public medical schools in the country, 30 private medical schools had opened and \n20\u00a0more were seeking medical accreditation. This has greatly expanded the domestic supply of health-care professionals, \nincluding in the three occupations covered by ASEAN MRAs. \nAs shown in Figure 3, between 2002 and 2011, the number of medical doctors roughly doubled from 17,400 to 36,600, \nand so did the number of nurses (35,300 to 74,800) and dentists (2,300 to 4,250). This rapid increase contributed to the \nexpansion of medical services for the country\u2019s growing population. By 2011, there were 12.6 medical practitioners per \n10,000 people compared to 7.1 in 2002; similarly, the ratio for nurses increased from 14.4 in 2002 to 25.8 in 2011.\nThe rapid increase of domestic health-care graduates was accompanied by some challenges, such as a shortage of clinical \ntraining sites and teaching staff, and wide variation in the quality of the education received by new graduates.

But is this actually a problem? On the one hand, as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Docquier puts it, \u201cThere are many more losers than \nwinners among developing countries\u201d when it comes to brain drain. Although economists have yet to develop methodologies \nto estimate the monetary costs of brain drain (which has been a challenge in the field due to lack of data and the sheer \ncomplexity of the issue), the loss of valuable human capital represents unrealized returns on a country\u2019s investments in \neducation and training. It also thins the country\u2019s knowledge base and reduces access to needed services such as health care, \neducation, and technology development. \nOn the other hand, as more recent research shows, highly skilled emigration has benefits. For one, in a more globally \nconnected world, this emigration is not always permanent. When returning home, migrants often bring along new skills, \nfinancial and social capital, and access to valuable networks, thus creating positive feedback effects. They also inspire others \nto pursue more education in the hope that they too might emigrate. Since not all newly trained professionals will leave the \ncountry, the domestic pool of highly skilled talent expands. Moreover, emigration eases temporary pressures on the labor \nmarket when the supply of labor outstrips available opportunities. Finally, as evidenced worldwide, migrants\u2019 remittances not \nonly improve their families\u2019 economic fortunes but also support productive investments. \nThe nature of migration is changing. Using Australian data on migration, Hugo, Wall, and Young demonstrate that there is \na significant circular migration of skilled people between Australia and the ASEAN countries (although about three times \nas many people move from ASEAN to Australia as those in the other direction). While many ASEAN nationals come to \nAustralia as international students or skilled temporary workers, returnees from Australia also tend to be skilled. Of those \nwho return permanently from Australia (mostly to fast-growing Singapore and Malaysia), close to 40% are professionals \nand 20% managers. The lack of detailed data in other traditional destinations for ASEAN migrants makes it difficult to draw \nparallels with the ASEAN-Australian case. That said, skills circulation is on the rise worldwide, aided by advancements in \ncommunications technology, the lower cost of international travel, and global employment opportunities.\nAvailable data and research make it clear that ASEAN has an opportunity to capitalize on these developments. The \nsubstantial diaspora of ASEAN nationals in predominantly high-income countries represents a unique resource that can be \nengaged to promote international trade, initiate foreign capital flows, and facilitate educational exchanges and technology \ntransfers. Put to good use, this resource will contribute to the expansion of opportunities in ASEAN. \nAgainst this backdrop, the changing demographics and rising levels of education across the region expand the pool of young, \neducated, and mobile professionals eager to take advantage of the economic and educational opportunities in the ASEAN \nregion, leading to greater skills circulation.\nSources: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Docquier, \u201cThe Brain Drain from Developing Countries,\u201d IZA World of Labor (May 2014): 6, http://wol.iza.org/\narticles/brain-drain-from-developing-countries/long; Tito Boeri et al., eds., Brain Drain and Brain Gain: The Global Competition to \nAttract High-Skilled Migrants (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2012); Adam Tyson, \u201cThe Brain Drain Cycle in Malaysia: Re-Thinking \nMigration, Diaspora and Talent,\u201d Malaysian Journal of Economic Studies 48, no. 2 (2011): 85\u201392; Satish Chand and Michael Clemens, \n\u201cSkilled Emigration and Skill Creation: A Quasi-Experiment\u201d (working paper no. 152, Center for Global Development, Washington, DC, \nSeptember 2008), www.cgdev.org/publication/skilled-emigration-and-skill-creation-quasi-experiment-working-paper-152; Albert \nBollard et al., \u201cRemittances and the Brain Drain Revisited: The Microdata Show that More Educated Migrants Remit More,\u201d World Bank \nEconomic Review 25, no. 1 (2011): 132\u201356; Graeme Hugo, Janet Wall, and Margaret Young, The Southeast Asia-Australia Regional \nMigration System: Some Insights into the \u201cNew Emigration\u201d (Washington, DC: MPI, 2015), www.migrationpolicy.org/research/southeast-\nasia-australia-regional-migration-system-some-insights-new-emigration; Demetrios G.
