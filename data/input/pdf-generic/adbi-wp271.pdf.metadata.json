INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nIn  2008\u201309 the  world  experienced  the  most severe financial  and  economic  crisis since  the \nGreat  Depression.  Although  the  crisis  originated  in  the  subprime  mortgage  market  in  the \nUnited States (US), it then spread to Europe and later to the rest of the world. The speed of \nthe contagion that spread across the world was perhaps unprecedented. What started off as \na  relatively  limited  crisis  in  the  US  housing  mortgage  sector  turned  successively  into  a \nwidespread  banking  crisis  in  the  US  and  Europe,  the  breakdown  of  both  domestic  and \ninternational  financial  markets,  and  then  later  into  a  full-blown  global  economic  crisis. \nInterestingly, however, although the emerging market economies in Asia and Latin America \nalso  suffered  severe  economic  impacts  from  the  crisis,  their  financial  sectors  exhibited \nrelative stability. No important financial institutions in these economies were affected in any \nsignificant fashion. So it really should be dubbed as the North Atlantic financial crisis rather \nthan as a global financial crisis. \n\nThe severity of the crisis can be gauged from a number of metrics. From an average annual \ngrowth rate of 4.1% between 2001 and 2008, world GDP growth fell to -0.8% in 2009 and is \nprojected  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  to  recover  to  3.9%  in  2010.1 That  the \nworld was taken by surprise by the developments in 2008 and 2009 is shown by the fact that \nas late as July 2008, the IMF expected world gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 3.9% \nin 2009.2 The reversal in expectations was so sudden that exactly a year later the forecast \nhad been reversed to -1.4% for 2009.3 Similarly, the growth forecast for 2010 was as low as \n1.9%  in  April  2009;  the  speed  of  the  recovery  now  taking  place  in  2010  was  also \nunexpected.4\n \n\nOptimism regarding the world economy had continued until mid-2008. In fact, global market \ncapitalization fell by 53% between the end of October 2007 and the end of March 2009, and \nlosses on US-originated credit assets were estimated by the IMF in April 2009 to amount to \n$2.7  trillion.  As  economies  have  contracted,  unemployment  has  increased  to  levels  in \nexcess  of  10%  in  North  America  and  Europe,  and  there  is  as  yet  little  sign  of  recovery  in \nemployment.  The  decline  in  property  prices  has  led  to  a  severe  reduction  in  household \nwealth.  Global  credit  write-downs  were  estimated  by  the  IMF  at  $2.8  trillion  in  the  October \n Of  these  only  about  $500  billion  were  outside  the \n2009  Global  Financial  Stability  Report.\nNorth Atlantic advanced economies. \n\n5\n\nAlmost all governments and central banks of the world were busy during 2008 and 2009 in \nan  effort  to  contain  the  effects  of  the  crisis  through  both  fiscal  and  monetary  policy \nmeasures, respectively. The fiscal effort, which has been largely successful at containing the \neconomic effects of the crisis, has been massive. Fiscal expansion of the Group of Twenty \n(G20) countries, relative to their 2007 levels, is approximately 6% of their GDP in both 2009 \nand 2010; US fiscal expansion is much higher, at just under 10% of its GDP. In containing \nthe  emerging  North  Atlantic  financial  crash  in  2008\u201309,  the  total  support  given  to  the \nfinancial  sector  in  advanced  economies  was  approximately  $7  trillion,  including  capital \ninjections into financial institutions by governments, purchase of assets by treasuries, central \nthese \nbank \n\ninjections,  and  other  upfront  government \n\nfinancing.  Some  of \n\nliquidity \n\n                                                \n1 IMF (2010b). \n\n2 IMF (2008). \n\n3 IMF (2009a). \n\n4 IMF (2010b). \n\n5 IMF (2009b). \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nexpenditures  will,  of  course,  be  recovered.6\n So the  cost  of this  crisis  has been  massive for \nthe  global  economy,  and  its  fiscal  effects  will  be  felt  for  some  time  to  come.  Just  as  the \nglobal  nature  of  the  crisis  has  been  unprecedented,  so  has  been  the  global  nature  of  the \nresponse, as exemplified by the G20\u2019s commitment to coordinated action. \n\nthe  coordinated \n\nAlong  with \nfiscal  and  monetary  policy  actions,  a  comprehensive \nreexamination  of  the  financial  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  is  also  underway \naround  the  world.  Consequent  to  all  the  rapid  and  exceptional  policy  actions  taken  around \nthe  world,  some  degree  of  normalcy  has  returned  to  global  financial  markets  in  2009\u201310. \nGiven  the  very  heavy,  worldwide  costs  of  the  recent  financial  crisis,  it  is  essential  that \ngovernments  and  regulatory  authorities  do  not  succumb  to  the  natural  temptations  of \ncomplacency that such a return to normalcy could entail. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, this paper attempts to analyze the emerging contours of regulation of \nfinancial institutions, with an emphasis on the emerging challenges and dynamics. Chapter 2 \nprovides a broad overview of the global developments that contributed to the current global \nfinancial  crisis.  Chapter  3  presents  the  ongoing  discussion  and  debate  at  the  international \nlevel regarding the shortcomings of the extant regulatory framework.  This is followed by an \nanalysis  of  proposals  for  reforming  the  regulatory  framework  in  Chapter  4,  and  the  paper \nconcludes  with  a  discussion  of  the  potential  difficulties  in  implementing  the  regulatory \nproposals. \n\n2.  EVOLUTION OF THE CRISIS: WHAT WENT WRONG? \n\nWhat are some of the identifiable sources of market failures that led to the current financial \nturbulence?  The  recent  financial  crisis  is  attributed  to  a  variety  of  factors,  such  as \ndevelopments in the subprime mortgage sector, excessive leverage, lax financial regulation \nand supervision, and global macroeconomic imbalances.7\n At a fundamental level, however, \nthe crisis also reflects the effects of a long period of excessively loose monetary policy in the \nmajor advanced economies during the early part of this past decade. \n\n2.1  Accommodative Monetary Policy \n\nAfter  the  dotcom  bubble  burst  in  the  US  around  the  turn  of  the  decade,  in  a  strong  policy \nresponse,  monetary  policy  was  eased  relatively  aggressively  in  the  US  and  then  in  other \nadvanced economies. In the United Kingdom, whereas long-term real interest rates (yield on \ntwenty-year  treasury  bonds)  averaged  about  3.5%  between  around  1985  and  1997,  they \nthen  declined  to  about  1%  by  2007.8 Policy  rates  in the  US reached  1%  in  2002  and  were \nheld  around  this  level  for  an  extended  period,  longer  than  was  probably  necessary. 9  \nExcessively loose monetary policy led to excess liquidity and consequent low interest rates \nworldwide;  furthermore,  the  burst  of  financial  innovation  during  this  period  amplified  and \naccelerated the consequences of excess liquidity and rapid credit expansion.10\n At one time, \ninvestors  in  fixed  income  instruments,  such  as  pension  funds  and  other  risk-averse \ninstitutions and individuals, could expect adequate risk-free real returns of around 3%, even \n\n                                                \n6 IMF (2009d, 2010a). \n\n7 Scott, Schultz, and Taylor (2010). \n\n8 Financial Services Authority (FSA 2009b). \n\n9. Taylor (2009); Yellen (2009). \n\n10 De Larosi\u00e8re Group (2009). \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nin the long term. However, with long-term interest rates declining to 1% and short-term rates \neven  lower,  investors  were  now  reduced  to  seeking  higher  yields  through  investment  in \nriskier instruments in both equity and debt, and in increasingly complex derivatives. \n\nWhat  is  interesting  about  this  episode  is  that  despite  the  persistent  accommodative \nmonetary policy and the accompanying strong worldwide macroeconomic growth, it did not \nresult  in  measured  inflationary  pressures  in  goods  and  most  services. 11\n Consequently, \ncentral  banks  in  advanced  economies,  particularly  in  the  US,  did  not  withdraw  monetary \naccommodation for an extended period. The excess liquidity worldwide did show up in rising \nasset  prices  and  later  in  commodity  prices,  particularly  oil.  It  was  only  then  that  measured \ninflation did start rising and central banks began to tighten monetary policy, though belatedly. \n\nWith significant increases in both investment and consumption, along with declining savings, \naggregate demand exceeded domestic output in the US for an extended period, leading to \npersistent  and  increasing  current  account  deficits  as  the  domestic  savings  investment \n This  large  excess  demand  of  the  US  was  supplied  by  the  rest  of  the \nimbalance  grew.\nworld,  especially  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  which  provided  goods  and  services  at \nrelatively  low  cost,  leading  to  corresponding  current  account  surpluses  in  PRC  and \nelsewhere.  The  surpluses  generated  by  the  oil-exporting  countries  added  to  the  emerging \nglobal imbalances. \n\n12\n\nLarge current account surpluses in PRC and other emerging market economies (EMEs) and \nequivalent deficits in the US and elsewhere are often attributed to the exchange rate policies \nin PRC, other EMEs, and oil exporters. Given the fact that US demand exceeded output, it is \napparent  that  with  unchanged  domestic  macroeconomic  policies,  the  US  current  account \ndeficit would have continued at its elevated levels. In the event of a more flexible exchange \nrate policy in PRC, the sources of imports for the US would have been some countries other \nthan  PRC.  Although  the  lack  of  exchange  rate  flexibility  among  the  Asian  EMEs  and  oil \nexporters  did  contribute to the  emergence  of global  imbalances,  it  can  not fully  explain  the \nlarge  and  growing  current  account  deficits  in  the  US,  particularly  since  Europe  as  a  whole \ndid not exhibit current account deficits at the same time. \n\n2.2  Search for Yields \n\nAs  noted,  accommodative  monetary  policy  and  the  corresponding  existence  of  low  interest \nrates  for  an  extended  period  encouraged  the  active  search  for  higher  yields  by  a  host  of \nmarket participants. The significant fall in real interest rates on low-risk instruments induced \nmany institutional investors to look for ways and means to achieve uplift in their returns, both \nin  their  home  economies  and  also  through  cross-border  investments.  Thus,  as  a \nmanifestation  of  the  search  for  higher  returns,  capital  not  only  flowed  toward  financial \ninnovation but also surged into EMEs; however, such flows could not be absorbed by these \neconomies  in  the  presence  of  either  large  current  account  surpluses  or  only  small  deficits, \nand  thus  largely  ended  up  as  official  reserves.    These  reserves  were  recycled  into  US \ngovernment  securities  and  those  of  the  government-sponsored  mortgage  entities  such  as \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Thus, while accommodative monetary policy kept short-term \ninterest  rates  low,  the  recycled  reserves  contributed  to  the  lowering  of  long-term  interest \nrates in the advanced economies, particularly in the US.13\n Such low long-term interest rates \ncontributed  to  the  growth  in  demand  for  housing  mortgage  finance  and  consequent  rise  in \nhousing prices. \n\n                                                \n11 Borio (2009). \n\n13 Borio (2009). \n\n12 The U.S. personal saving rate hovered only slightly above zero from mid-2005 to mid-2007 (Yellen 2009). \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nFurthermore,  the  stable  macroeconomic  environment,  relatively  stable  growth,  and  low \ninflation in the run-up to the crisis led to sustained underpricing of risks and hence excessive \nrisk taking and financial innovation in the major advanced economies. It may be ironic that \nthe  perceived  success  of  central  banks  and  increased  credibility  of  monetary  policy,  which \nled to enhanced expectations with regard to stability in both inflation and interest rates, could \nhave  led  to  the  mispricing  of  risk  and  hence  enhanced  risk  taking.  Easy  monetary  policy \nitself  may  have  generated  a  search  for  yields  that  resulted  in  a  dilution  of  standards  in \nassessing  credit  risk,  leading  to  erosion  of  sound  practices. 14\n Lower  yields  encouraged \nexcessive  leverage  as  banks  and  financial  institutions  attempted  to  maintain  their \nprofitability. Lacunae in financial regulation and supervision allowed this excessive leverage \nin  the  financial  system.  Assets  were  either  shifted  to  off-balance-sheet  vehicles  that  were \neffectively  unregulated,  or  financial  innovation  synthetically  reduced  the  perceived  risks  on \nbalance sheets. \n\nThe  sustained  rise  in  asset  prices,  particularly  house  prices,  on  the  back  of  excessively \naccommodative  monetary  policy,  and \nlending  standards  coupled  with  financial \ninnovations resulted in the high growth in mortgage credit to households, particularly to low-\ncredit-quality  households.  Due  to  the  \u201coriginate  and  distribute\u201d  model,  most  of  these \nmortgages were securitized. In combination with strong growth in complex credit derivatives \nand with the use of credit ratings, the mortgages, inherently subprime, were bundled into a \nvariety of tranches, including AAA tranches, and sold to a range of financial investors looking \nfor higher yields. \n\nlax \n\nAs  inflation  started  creeping  up  beginning  in  2004,  the  US  Federal  Reserve  did  start  to \nwithdraw  monetary  accommodation.  Consequently,  mortgage  payments  started  rising  with \nthe increasing interest rates, while housing prices started to ease. Low-to-negligible margin \nfinancing  and  low  initial  teaser  rates  incentivized  default  by  the  subprime  borrowers. \nAlthough the loans were supposedly securitized and sold to the off-balance-sheet structured \ninvestment vehicles, the losses were ultimately borne by the banks and financial institutions, \nwiping out a significant fraction of their capital. The uncertainty about the extent of the likely \nbank losses led to a breakdown of trust among banks. Given growing financial globalization, \nbanks and financial institutions in other major advanced economies, especially Europe, were \nalso  adversely  affected  by  losses  and  capital  write-offs.  Interbank  money  markets  nearly \nfroze, and this was reflected in very high spreads in money markets and debt markets. There \nwas an aggressive search for safety, which resulted in very low yields on Treasury bills and \nbonds. These  developments  were  significantly  accentuated following  the failure  of  Lehman \nBrothers in September 2008, which led to a complete lack of confidence in global financial \nmarkets. \n\nThe deep and lingering crisis in global financial markets, the extreme level of risk aversion, \nthe mounting losses of banks and financial institutions, the elevated level of commodity and \noil prices (until the third quarter of 2008), and the sharp correction in a range of asset prices, \nall  combined,  suddenly  led  to  the  sharp  slowdown  in  growth  momentum  in  the  major \nadvanced  economies,  especially  since  the  Lehman  failure.  Global  growth  for  2009,  which \nwas  projected  at  a  healthy  3.8%  in  April  2008,  is  now  estimated  by  the  IMF  to  have \ncontracted by 0.8%. \n\nThus the causes for the global crisis reflect the interaction of monetary policy, the choice of \nexchange rate regime in a number of countries, and important changes within the financial \nsystem  itself,  along  with  lax  regulation  arising from  the  belief  in  efficient  markets  and  light-\ntouch  regulation. 15\n To  recap,  low  interest  rates,  together  with  increasing  and  excessive \noptimism about the future, pushed up asset prices, from stock prices to housing prices. Low \n\n                                                \n14 Mohan (2007); Borio (2009). \n\n15 See the de Larosi\u00e8re Group (2009); Bank for International Settlements (2008). \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\ninterest  rates  and  limited  volatility  prompted  the  search  for  yield  down  the  credit  quality \ncurve,  and  underestimation  of  risks  led  to  creation  and  purchase  of  riskier  assets.  Central \nbanks,  focused  on  measured  consumer  price  inflation  and  aggregate  activity,  while \nneglecting asset price movements, did not perceive the full implications of the growing risks \nuntil it was too late.16\n \n\n3.  SHORTCOMINGS IN FINANCIAL REGULATION AND \n\nSUPERVISION \n\nThere  have  been  calls  for  fundamental  rethinking  on  macroeconomic,  monetary,  and \nfinancial sector policies to meet the new challenges and realities; many of these ideas entail \na structural shift in the international financial architecture and a potentially enhanced degree \nof coordination among monetary authorities and regulators. A review of the policies relating \nto financial regulation needs to address both the acute policy dilemmas in the short run and \na fundamental rethinking of the broader frameworks of financial and economic policies over \nthe medium term.17\n \n\nThere  has  been  a  great  deal  of  very  active  discussion  internationally  about  existing \nregulatory practices and the future of financial regulation and supervision. It is also perhaps \ncorrect  to  say  that  there  is  an  emerging  consensus  on  how  financial  regulation  and \nsupervision needs to be changed. The intensity of discussion is reflected in the plethora of \nreports that have been issued by authoritative sources: \n\ni.  Report of the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the European Union; \n\nchairman: Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re (de Larosi\u00e8re Group 2009). \n\nii.  The  Structure  of  Financial  Supervision:  Approaches  and  Challenges  in  a  Global \n\nMarket Place; chairman: Paul Volcker (Group of Thirty 2008).  \n\niii.  The  Fundamental  Principles  of  Financial  Regulation,  also known  as  the Geneva \n\nReport (Brunnermeier and others 2009). \n\niv.  The  Turner  Review:  A  Regulatory  Response  to  the  Global  Banking  Crisis \n\n(Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom [FSA] 2009b).  \n\nv.  The report of Working Group 1 of the G20 on \u201cEnhancing, Sound Regulation and \n\nStrengthening Transparency\u201d (G20 2009). \n\nvi.  Report  of  the  Commission  of  Experts  of  the  President  of  the  United  Nations \nGeneral  Assembly  on  Reforms  of  the  International  Monetary  and  Financial \nSystem, also known as the Stiglitz Report (UN 2009). \n\nvii.

The  US  Treasury  report,  Financial  Regulatory  Reform:  A  New  Foundation  (US \n\nDepartment of the Treasury 2009). \n\nix.  The report of the Warwick Commission (2009). \n\nWhat  is  common  among  all  these  reports  is  the  acknowledgment  that  regulation  and \nsupervision  in  the  advanced  economies  were  clearly  too  lax  in  recent  times,  and  that \nconsiderable  reevaluation  is  needed,  leading  to  stronger  and  perhaps  more  intrusive \nregulation  and  supervision  in  the  financial  sector.  There  is  clear  recognition  of  serious \nregulatory and supervisory failures. \n\n                                                \n16 IMF (2009c). \n\n17 Reddy (2008). \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nAt  the  root  of  such  rethinking  is  really  the  questioning  of  existing  intellectual  assumptions \nwith  respect  to  the  functioning  of  markets  and  the  nature  of  financial  risk.  To  quote  the \nTurner Review:  \n\nAt the core of these assumptions has been the theory of efficient and \nrational  markets.  Five  propositions  with  implications  for  regulatory \napproach have followed: \n\n(i)  Market  prices  are  good  indicators  of  rationally  evaluated \n\neconomic value. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  development  of  securitized  credit,  since  based  on  the \ncreation of new and more liquid markets, has improved both \nallocative efficiency and financial stability. \n\nThe  risk  characteristics  of  financial  markets  can  be  inferred \nfrom  mathematical  analysis,  delivering  robust  quantitative \nmeasures of trading risk. \n\n(iv)  Market  discipline  can  be  used  as  an  effective  tool  in \n\nconstraining harmful risk taking. \n\n(v) \n\nFinancial  innovation  can  be  assumed  to  be  beneficial  since \nmarket competition would winnow out any innovations which \ndid not deliver value added. \n\nEach of these assumptions is now subject to extensive challenge on \nboth theoretical and empirical grounds, with potential implications for \nthe  appropriate  design  of  regulation  and  for  the  role  of  regulatory \nauthorities.18\n \n\nWhat were the specific developments in the financial system that arose from these broadly \naccepted intellectual assumptions that led to the ongoing global financial crisis? \n\n3.1  Recurring Financial Crises: Buildup of Excessive Leverage \n\nFinancial  and  banking  crises  have  a  long  history,  which  is  as  old  as  the  existence  of  the \nfinancial sector itself.19\n All liquid markets can be susceptible to swings in sentiment that can \nproduce significant divergence from rational equilibrium prices. However, boom and bust in \nequity  prices  have  surprisingly  small  consequences  relative  to  boom  and  bust  in  credit \ninstruments,  unless  investment  in  equity  instruments  is  itself  from  heavily  leveraged \nborrowed  resources. What  is  common  among  almost  all  crises  is  the  buildup  of  excessive \nleverage  in  the  system  and  the  inevitable  bursting  of  the  financial  bubble  that  results  from \nsuch  leverage.  What  is  interesting  about  the  current  crisis  is  that  this  excess  leverage \noccurred over a period when, through the Basel process, greater consensus had developed \non the need for and level of adequate capital required in banking institutions across all major \njurisdictions.  Furthermore,  it  was  assumed  that  sophisticated  financial  risk  management \ncapabilities  also  had  been  developed  within  large  financial  institutions  during  this  period  of \nunusually rapid growth in both the magnitude and sophistication of the financial system. This \nhad some perverse results. First, because of the perceived increase in sophistication in the \nmeasurement of risk, high-quality risk capital in large banks could be as low as 2% of assets, \neven while complying with the Basel capital adequacy requirements. Second, large financial \ninstitutions could maintain lower high-quality capital because of the assumption that they had \nbetter risk management capacity than smaller, less sophisticated institutions. \n\n                                                \n18 FSA (2009b, p. 30). \n\n19 Kindleberger and Aliber (2005); Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nWith financial deregulation in key jurisdictions like the US and the United Kingdom, as well \nas  in  most  other  countries,  financial  institutions  also  grew  in  complexity.  Financial \nconglomerates  began  to  include  all  financial  functions  under  one  roof:  banking,  insurance, \nasset  management,  proprietary  trading,  investment  banking,  brokerage,  and  the  like.  The \nconsequence has been inadequate appreciation and assessment of the emerging risks, both \nwithin  institutions  and  systemwide.  What  were  the  factors  that  led  to  this  emergence  of \nexcessive systemwide and institutional risk? \n\n3.2  Growth in Securitized Credit and Derivatives \n\nAmong the notable developments of the last decade has been the unprecedented explosive \ngrowth  of  securitized  credit  intermediation  and  associated  derivatives.20 \u201cThe  wreckage  on \nWall  Street  stems  in  part  from  the  explosive  growth  in  complex  and  mispriced  securitized \nmortgages, which the banks both issued and themselves held.\u201d21 For example, the issuance \nof collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) tripled between the first quarters of 2005 and 2007, \nreaching a peak of $179 billion in the second quarter of 2007, before collapsing to $5 billion \nby  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008.  The  issuance  of  residential  mortgage-backed  securities \ndoubled from $1.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion between 2001 and 2003. The assumption underlying \nthis development was that it constituted a mechanism that took risk off the balance sheets of \nbanks,  placing  it  with  a  diversified  set  of  investors  and  thereby  serving  to  reduce  banking \nsystem  risks.  The  opposite  actually  transpired.  As  late  as  April  2006,  the  IMF\u2019s  Global \nFinancial Stability Report noted that this dispersion would help \u201cmitigate and absorb shocks \nto the financial system\u201d with the result that \u201cimproved resilience may be seen in fewer bank \nfailures and more consistent credit provision.\u201d22\n \n\nThis assumption has already proven erroneous, although simple forms of securitization have \nexisted  for  a  long  time.  Among  the  key  functions  of  banks  is  maturity  transformation:  they \nintermediate  shorter-term  liabilities  to  fund  longer-term  assets  in  the  nonfinancial  sector. \nBanks  are  typically  highly  leveraged,  and  hence  trust  and  confidence  are  crucial  to  their \nfunctioning  and  stability.  Traditionally,  therefore,  banks  exercised  sharp  vigilance  over  the \nrisk elements of their assets, which were typically illiquid, to ensure constant rollover of their \nshorter-term  funding  liabilities.  What  securitization  does  is  to  turn  illiquid  assets  into  liquid \nones,  which  in  theory  then  disperse  risks  from  the  banks\u2019  balance  sheets  and  also  reduce \ntheir required banking capital. With assets themselves seen as liquid short-term instruments, \nthey began to be funded by ultra-short-term liabilities, including even overnight repos whose \nvolume  increased  manyfold  in  recent  years.  The  majority  of  holdings  of  securitized  credit, \nhowever,  actually  ended  up  on  the  books  of  highly  leveraged  banks  and  bank-like \ninstitutions,  and  hence  risk  was  concentrated  rather  than  being  dispersed.  Systemic  risk \nincreased  because  traded  instruments  are  inherently  more  susceptible  to  price  swings  in \nresponse to changes in market sentiment. What emerged was a \u201ccomplex chain of multiple \nrelationships  between  multiple  institutions\u201d  and  hence  a  higher  risk  of  contagion  within  the \nfinancial  sector.\n Furthermore,  liquidity  risks  in  such  markets  were  not  understood \nadequately.  It  was  assumed  that  these  liquid  markets  would  always  exist,  and  hence \nsecuritized  assets  were  assumed  to  be  inherently  less  risky  than  illiquid  long-term  credit \nassets. \n\n23\n\n                                                \n20 Yellen (2009). \n\n21 Committee on Capital Markets Regulation (CCMR, 2009, p. 19). \n\n22 As quoted in the Turner Review (FSA 2009b, p. 42). \n\n23 FSA (2009b). \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nFinancial innovation arising from the search for yields compounded this problem as second-\norder  derivatives  proliferated  and  as  their  valuation  increasingly  depended  upon  model \nvaluation  and  credit  ratings  rather  than  on  observable  and  transparent  market  valuation; \nhence  such  derivatives  inherently  became  more  opaque.  Thus,  when  problems  arose  in \nthese markets and prices were not visible, valuation of the assets of banks and the shadow \nbanking system became unobservable.  Consequently, trust and confidence evaporated and \nmarkets froze. \n\nCompounding these problems was the emergence of the shadow banking system that took \nassets off of banks\u2019 balance sheets, thereby reducing the latter\u2019s capital requirements.  The \ncomplexity  and  magnitude  of  intrafinancial  sector  transactions  exploded  over  this  past \ndecade. For example, issuance of global credit derivatives increased from near zero in 2001 \nto over $60 trillion in 2007; foreign exchange (forex) trading activity rose tenfold from about \n$100 billion to $1,000 billion in the twenty years between 1987 and 2007, and doubled again \nafter 2002; over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives grew from around zero in 1987 \nto  about  $50  trillion  in  1997  and  $400  trillion  by  2007;  global  issuance  of  asset-backed \nsecurities went up from about $500 billion in 1997 to over $2 trillion in 2007; and trading in oil \nfutures  increased  from  an  equivalent  of  about  300  million  barrels  in  2005  to  1,000  million \nbarrels in 2007, more than ten times the volume of oil produced!24\n Thus the financial sector \nwas increasingly separated from the real economy. \n\nGiven the explosive increase in financial transactions unrelated to developments in the real \neconomy, the financial sector exhibited high profits and growth while doing relatively little for \nthe  nonfinancial  sectors  of  the  economy,  which  the  financial  sector  exists  to  serve  in \nprinciple. The debt of financial companies increased to levels exceeding the GDP of leading \neconomies: in the United Kingdom, for example, financial sector debt increased from 40% of \nGDP in 1987 to 200% in 2007, and in the US, from a similar 40% in 1987 to over 100% in \n  Thus, in the process of taking risks off balance sheets through securitization, these \n2007.\nrisks  returned  to  the  extended  banking  system  itself,  belying  the  original  rationale  for \nthe  development  of  complex \nsecuritization. \nsecuritization  and  associated  derivatives  only  served  to  increase  it.    Moreover,  it  became \nincreasingly difficult to trace where the risk ultimately lay. \n\nthan  reducing  systemic  risk, \n\n  Rather \n\n25\n\nin \n\ntaking  account  of  these \nThe  regulatory  system  was  clearly  behind  the  curve \ndevelopments.  The  procedures \nrequirements \nfor  calculating \nunderestimated  the  risks  inherent  in  traded  securitized  instruments,  thereby  adding  to  the \nincentive  for  banks  to  securitize  assets  into  traded  instruments,  which  bore  lower  risk \nweights. The trading of these instruments has largely been in OTC markets that exhibit little \ntransparency. As a result of this overall process, banks became effectively undercapitalized, \nand  the  leverage  ratios  of  the  unregulated  shadow  banking  system  and  investment  banks \nreached unsustainable levels. A good deal of the ongoing discussion on change in regulation \nis  focused  on  this  issue  through  mandating  increased  capital  requirements  for  such \nactivities. \n\nrisk-based  capital \n\nto  originate \n\nWith  the  existence  of  low  interest  rates,  mispriced  low-risk  perceptions,  and  inherent \nincentives \ninstruments,  household \nlending  and  distribute  securitized \nindebtedness increased to unprecedented levels, particularly for housing. In both the US and \nthe United Kingdom, the household debt-to-GDP ratio increased from an average of around \n60% between the mid-1980s and 1990s to over 100% in the following decade.26\n Demand for \nhousing assets rose and housing prices escalated accordingly.  Thus microlevel behavior led \n\n                                                \n24 Turner (2010). \n\n25 FSA (2009a). \n\n26 FSA (2009b). \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nto  increased  systemic  risk  that  was  not  adequately  appreciated  or  understood,  and  hence \nwas not monitored by the authorities. \n\nThus there are immense emerging challenges that confront financial sector regulators as a \nconsequence of the ongoing North Atlantic financial crisis. We can look forward to There will \nbe  extensive  debate  at  both  the  academic  level  and  among  practitioners.  How  will \neconomists and policymakers change their views on the efficiency and rationality of markets, \nparticularly  financial  markets?  What  will  be  the  effect  of  such  reexamination  on  financial \ninnovation  in  the  future?  What  will  regulatory  authorities  do  in  the  meantime  while  these \ndebates  are  being  settled  at  the  intellectual  level? Will  they  overreact  and  restrict  financial \ngrowth in the months and years to come? Will this affect global GDP growth as well? \n\nAt  this  point  I  turn  to  the  key  proposals  currently  being  made  for  a  major  overhaul  of  the \nfinancial regulatory architecture. \n\n4.  REFORMING THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: THE \n\nFUTURE PERSPECTIVE \n\nThere has been and is a great deal of discussion at both the national and international levels \non  reforming  the  financial  regulatory  system  to  address  the  various  weaknesses  that  have \nemerged. At the national level, for example, both the US and U.K. treasuries have released \ndetailed  proposals  for  regulatory  reform  that  are  now  being  considered  by  their  respective \nlegislatures.27 At  the  international  level,  it  is  the  G20  that  took  the  lead  in  late  2008.28 The \nresulting  recommendations  of  the  G20  Working  Group  1  were  broadly  accepted  by  the \nleaders  and  remitted  for  implementation  to  the  various  standard-setting  bodies,  with  the \nFinancial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  assigned  a  broad  coordination  role.  The  key  objective \noutlined by the FSB for regulatory reform is to create a \u201cmore disciplined and less procyclical \nfinancial system that better supports balanced sustainable economic growth.\u201d29\n \n\nis  no  question, \n\ntherefore,  that  financial  regulation  has \n\nThere \nto  be  strengthened \ncomprehensively. The prevailing intellectual paradigm of light-touch regulation premised on \nthe  efficient  markets  hypothesis  is  being  questioned.  Hitherto  unregulated  institutions, \nmarkets, and instruments now will have to be brought under the regulatory framework, and \nthe framework  itself  will  need to  be redesigned  to  address  the  emerging needs  at  both  the \nnational and international levels.  As this new enthusiasm for financial regulation unfolds, it is \nimportant that to keep in mind the basic functions of the financial system, and how they can \nbe  strengthened  so  that  the  needs  of  the  real  economy  are  better  served.  To  reiterate: \namong the key objectives of regulatory reform is to emerge with a \u201cmore disciplined and less \nprocyclical  financial  system  that  better  supports  balanced  sustainable  economic  growth.\u201d \nSuch a system would not, for example, allow leverage to increase to the extent that it did.\n\n30\n \n\n4.1  Financial Innovation \n\nReform  should  ensure  that  the  financial  system  continues  to  play  a  vital  role  in \nintermediating  savings  to  provide  adequate  levels  of  funding  to  the  real  sector,  thereby \nsupporting  economic  growth.  It  needs  to  be  recognized  that  financial  markets  will  remain \n\n                                                \n27 U.S. Department of the Treasury (2009); H.M. Treasury (2009). \n\n28 G20 Working Group 1 (2009). \n\n29 FSB (2009). \n\n30 FSB (2009). \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nglobal  and  interconnected,  while  financial  innovation  will  remain  important  for  fostering \neconomic  efficiency.  Hence,  while \nregulation  and  supervision  must  be \nstrengthened,  this  process  must  take  care  not  to  stifle  entrepreneurship  and  financial \ninnovation.  Still,  the  following  question  must  be  constantly  asked:  \u201cFinancial  innovation \ntoward what objective?\u201d \n\nfinancial \n\nAs  long  as  financial  innovation  is  seen  to  promote  price  discovery,  greater  intermediation \nefficiency,  better  risk  management,  and  hence  overall  efficiency  and  growth,  it  must  be \nencouraged,  but  with  appropriate  safeguards  to  maintain  financial  stability.  Unproductive \nfinancial innovation, however, will need to be discouraged. Therefore, the debate on financial \ninnovation  and  regulation  has  to  be  framed  in  terms  of  the  potential  and  systematic \nrelevance  of  such  innovations  in  addition  to  the  means  for  bringing  them  effectively  under \nthe regulatory umbrella.31\n The notional amounts of global derivatives relative to the nominal \nvalue  of  GDP  exploded  during  the  decade  preceding  the  financial  crisis.  What  was  the \neconomic contribution of such growth in the global economic and financial system? It clearly \ndid not make the global financial system any safer at the macrolevel. Did market participants \ngain through better risk management in both the real and financial sectors? Addressing such \nquestions will require intensive research on the utility of the kinds of financial innovation that \nhave occurred over the past couple of decades. What has been beneficial and what has not? \nAs  work  proceeds  to  bring  new  financial  products  and  different  kinds  of  derivatives  under \ncloser financial regulation and supervision, it should be guided by the answers to such basic \nquestions. \n\nIn  general,  therefore,  there  is  a  need  for  reform  of  the  regulatory  framework  to  shield  the \nfinancial  system \nthe \nconsequences of any future episodes of financial stress. \n\nfrom  potential  crises  while \n\nidentifying  measures \n\nto  mitigate \n\n4.2  Perimeter of Financial Regulation \n\nThe  regulatory framework  will  need  to keep  pace  with  the  associated  risks  in  a  more  rapid \nand effective manner. Large, complex financial institutions will continue to operate in multiple \njurisdictions in order to meet the needs of their large global clients, and supervision will need \nto  be  better  coordinated  internationally  with  a  robust global  resolution framework. To  avoid \nregulatory  arbitrage,  there  is  a  need  for  greater  consistency  in  the  regulation  of  similar \ninstruments  and  of  institutions  performing  similar  activities,  both  within  and  across  borders. \nAs  overall  financial  regulation  is  strengthened,  it  will  be  essential  that  it  apply  to  all \nsystemically important financial institutions.  For example, if only banks are subject to tighter \nregulation, that will inevitably lead to regulatory arbitrage, with much financial sector activity \nshifting  to  other,  more  lightly  regulated  financial  institutions.  That  is  why  the  G20  Working \nGroup  stressed  the  need  to  regulate  all  systemically  important  financial  institutions.  The \nquestions again are how much regulation, what constitutes \u201csystemically important,\u201d how to \nensure  that  all  applicable  entities,  markets,  and  instruments  are  regulated,  and  what  form \nshould the regulation take? \n\nThere is a great degree of continuing discussion on the regulation of large, complex financial \ninstitutions.  Undoubtedly  they  will  continue  to  have  a  global  presence.  How  will  they  be \nbetter regulated across borders? How can better global resolution regimes be designed that \nwill work in practice? \n\nIn addition, capital markets will require greater emphasis on reducing counterparty risk and \non ensuring that their infrastructure allows them to remain a source of funding during periods \nof  stress.  The  postcrisis  period  is  likely  to  be  characterized  by  a  financial  system  that \nfunctions  with  lower  levels  of  leverage,  reduced  funding  mismatches  (both  in  terms  of \nmaturity  and  currency),  less  exposure  to  counterparty  risk,  and  greater  transparency \n                                                \n31 Mohan (2007); FSA (2009b); Turner (2010). \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nregarding  financial  instruments.  After  credit  markets  recover  from  the  crisis,  it  will  be \nimportant to mitigate the inevitable pressure to expand profits through increased risk taking. \nA more developed macroprudential approach will be important in this context. \n\nThe type, size, and cross-border exposures of institutions and markets that will emerge from \nthis  crisis  are  likely  to  be  considerably  different  than  before.  As  banks  and  financial \ninstitutions  consolidate,  policymakers  will  have  to  adapt  prudential  regulation  to  firms  of \nvarying  degrees  of  size  and  concentration.  There  is  now  general  agreement,  for  example, \nthat institutions above some size threshold should be subject to higher capital requirements, \npossibly on an escalating basis.32\n Similarly, the design of any new or revised policy will need \nto ensure healthy competition. Were the high returns that the financial sector exhibited in the \ndecade preceding the crisis due to inadequate competition, or to excessive expansion in the \ntrading of financial instruments, or both? Financial institutions, markets, and instruments will \ncontinue  to  evolve  in  ways  that  pose  challenges  for  regulation,  notwithstanding  the \nretrenchment  that  is  currently  underway.  Financial  institutions,  policymakers,  supervisors, \nand regulators will all need to become better equipped to manage the interconnectedness of \nmarkets, both domestically and globally, as well as the effects of innovation and the potential \nfor incentives to become misaligned. \n\nIt  will  be  necessary  to  consider  the  appropriate  timing  for  changes  in  the  regulatory \nframework  going  forward.  Recommendations  should  promote  proportionate  regulatory \nreaction when needed, acknowledging the possible limits of the self-regulatory approach in \nsome  contexts.  For  example,  while  ultimately  capital  buffers  for  the  system  should  be \nenhanced  during  periods  of  economic  expansion,  in  order to  be  drawn  down  as  needed  in \ndownturns,  changes  in  the  current  environment  may  have  negative  impact  on  the  real \neconomy.  A  considered  and  comprehensive  review  of  the  consequences  of  reforms  and \nharmonization,  coordinated  across  jurisdictions,  is  necessary  to  increase  the  effective \ntransition to a more stable financial system.\n\n33\n \n\nIn  short,  the  overarching  mandate  of  reforms  is  to  make  regulatory  regimes  more  effective \nover  the  cycle.  This  is  related  to  many  other  issues,  including  certain  aspects  of \ncompensation  schemes at financial  institutions,\n margin  requirements  and  risk management \npractices focused on value-at-risk calculations based on short historical samples\n, the capital \nadequacy framework, and valuation and loan loss provisioning practices.  In addition, there \nis  a  need  to  redefine  the  scope  of  the  regulatory  framework  to  establish  appropriate \noversight  for  the  institutions  and  markets  that  may  be  the  source  of  systemic  risk.    Risk \nmanagement  also  must  be  improved  to  better  evaluate  vulnerabilities  arising  from  low-\nfrequency, systemwide risks and to better mitigate these risks. \n\nAgainst this broad background, this section endeavors to focus on defining the priorities for \naction in so far as financial regulation and supervision are concerned. \n\n4.2.1  Macroprudential Orientation \n\nAs  observed,  the  buildup  of  microinstitutional  risks  resulted  in  the  unfolding  of  massive \nmacro risk, partly through the rise in unsustainable asset prices. Therefore, as a supplement \nto  sound  microprudential  and  market  integrity  regulation,  national  financial  regulatory \nframeworks  should  be  reinforced  with  a  macroprudential  oversight  that  promotes  a \nsystemwide  approach  to  financial  regulation  and  supervision  and  mitigates  the  buildup  of \nobservable excess risks across the system. For example, there is now increasing agreement \nthat when credit growth exceeds certain thresholds, it should entail additional capital buffer \n\n                                                \n32 FSB (2009); BCBS (2009b); CCMR (2009); Warwick Commission (2009). \n\n33 G20 Working Group 1 (2009). \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nrequirements.34\n Such thresholds will have to vary across jurisdictions, and the challenge will \nremain how to identify such thresholds. Prudential regimes should encourage behavior that \nsupports  systemic  stability,  discourages  regulatory  arbitrage,  and  adopts  the  concept  of \n\u201csystemic\u201d risk, factoring in the effects of leverage and funding.  In most jurisdictions, this will \nrequire improved coordination mechanisms between various financial authorities, mandates \nfor  all  financial  authorities  account  for  financial  system  stability,  and  effective  tools  to \naddress systemic risks. It will also require an effective global roundtable\u2014currently proposed \nto  be  the  Financial  Stability  Board\u2014to  bring  together  national  financial  authorities  to  jointly \nassess systemic risks across the global financial system and to coordinate policy responses. \n\nA  number  of  policymaking  institutions,  particularly  central  banks,  have  enhanced  their \nanalysis  of  systemic  risk  in  recent  years.  In  fact,  many  of  the  systemic  vulnerabilities  that \ncaused  or  exacerbated  the  current  turmoil  had  already  been  identified,  but  mechanisms  to \neffectively translate these analyses into policy action have been lacking. The basic idea here \nis to multiply the capital adequacy ratios with a systemic risk factor. This means that better \nmeasures  of macroprudential  risk  must  be found. It  is  argued  that  leverage  ratios, maturity \nmismatches,  and  estimates  of  bank  credit  expansion  should  be  taken  into  account.  Thus \nhighly  leveraged  and fast growing  \u201csystemic\u201d  institutions  would  be  subject  to  higher capital \nrequirements  than  the  rest.  The  idea  is  that  when  there  is  growing  systemic  risk, \ncharacterized  by  increasing  leverage,  maturity  mismatches,  credit  expansion,  and  asset \nprice increases during boom times, the required amount of banking capital should increase, \nand  conversely  decrease  during  downturns  when  deleveraging  takes  place  (Brunnermeier \nand others 2009).  These ideas are now gaining wider acceptance, and the standard setters \nare busy finding ways and means to translate them into practice. \n\nPotential macroprudential tools to be explored further could include: \n\ni. \n\ncomplementing  risk-based  capital  measures  with  simpler  indicators \naimed  to  measure  the  buildup  of  leverage,  with  enhanced  sensitivity  to \noff-balance-sheet exposures; \n\nii. \n\ncapital requirements that adjust over the financial cycle; \n\niii.  monitoring the sectoral growth of credit to identify areas of \u201cexcess credit \n\ngrowth\u201d when they arise; \n\niv. \n\nv. \n\nloan  loss  provisioning  standards  that  incorporate  all  available  credit \ninformation; \n\nuse of longer historical samples to assess risk and margin requirements; \nand \n\nvi. \n\ngreater focus on loan-to-value ratios for mortgages. \n\nIn general, the challenge is to continually endeavor to strike a balance between macro- and \nmicroprudential regulation. \n\n4.2.2  Regulatory Regime \n\nWith  the  emergence  of  the  shadow  banking  system  and  other  leveraged  financial \ninstitutions,  the  scope  of  regulation  and  oversight  needs  to  be  expanded  to  include  all \nsystemically  important  institutions,  markets,  and  instruments.  Accordingly,  the  perimeter  of \nfinancial  sector  surveillance  would  have  to  be  extended,  possibly  with  differentiated \nthresholds  to  allow  institutions  to  graduate  from  simple  disclosures  to  higher  levels  of \nprudential  oversight  as  their  contribution  to  systemic risks  increases. Work  is  under  way  to \ndevise practical guidelines for regulators to assess systemic importance so that regulation of \n\n                                                \n34 FSB (2009); BCBS (2009b); Warwick Commission (2009). \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nall  systemically  important  institutions  can  be  done  in  a  consistent  manner. 35\n Financial \nauthorities will need enhanced information on all material financial institutions and markets, \nincluding  private  pools  of  capital  that  are  leveraged.  Large,  complex  financial  institutions \nrequire  particularly  robust  oversight  given  their  size  and  global  reach.  Regulatory \ndisincentives should also be included to discourage such institutions from becoming too big \nto  fail  and  to  reduce  complexity  in  their  group  structures.  The  regulatory  and  oversight \nframework  should  strive  to  treat  similar  institutions  and  activities  consistently,  with  greater \nemphasis on functions and activities and less emphasis on legal status. \n\nThe main bone of contention here, inter alia, is whether and how to regulate private pools of \ncapital,  including  private  equity  funds  and  hedge  funds.  There  is  no  doubt  that  such  funds \nhave increased in size tremendously over the past couple of decades. The amount of money \nhedge funds manage has increased from around $40 billion in 1990 to $540 billion in 2001 \nand  $2  trillion  in  2008,  a  growth  rate  far  in  excess  of  any  metric  related  to  the  real \n36  There  are  now  about  10,000  hedge  funds  in  existence.  There  have  been \neconomy.\ndifferences in opinion regarding the role of these funds in the current global financial crisis. \nNevertheless, there is broad agreement that private pools of capital, including hedge funds, \ncan be a source of risk owing to their combined size in the market, their use of leverage and \nmaturity  mismatches,  and  their  connectedness  with  other  parts  of  the  financial  system. \nThere  is  emerging  agreement  that  all  such  funds  need  to  be  registered  with  a  designated \nregulatory authority, but there is continuing debate on the extent of their regulation.37\n \n\nThe widespread reliance of market participants on credit ratings of market instruments led to \ninadequate  risk  analysis.  Thus  credit  rating  agencies  also  will  require  regulatory  oversight. \nFurthermore, there is a need to modify rating agency practices and procedures for managing \nconflicts  of  interest  and  for  assuring  the  transparency  and  quality  of  the  rating  process, \nparticularly  the  process  for  rating  complex  securitized  instruments  and  derivatives.  Certain \nregulatory  regimes  mandate  the  use  of  credit  ratings  for  risk  management  and  for \nassessment  of  capital  requirements  within  institutions,  leading  to  inadequate  in-house \nassessment  of  risk  by  these  institutions.  Regulators  will  need  to  reduce  or  eliminate  such \nmandates  so  that  all  financial  institutions  take  greater  responsibility  for  their  own  risk \nassessments.  Given  the  global  scope  of  some  credit  rating  agencies,  the  oversight \nframework should be consistent across jurisdictions, with appropriate sharing of information \nbetween national authorities responsible for the oversight of credit rating agencies. There is \nalso  need  for  much  greater  independent  research  in  assessing  post  facto  how  well  credit \nrating  agencies  have \ntheir  data  and \nmethodologies are generally proprietary, including the confidential information they have on \nthe entities and instruments being rated, such research has been difficult, if not impossible, \nto do. Regulators will need to find ways of making such research possible without violating \nthe need to maintain confidentiality. \n\ntheir  credit  rating  practices.  Since \n\nfared \n\nin \n\n4.2.3  Procyclicality \n\nOnce  conditions  in  the  financial  system  have  recovered,  international  standards  for  capital \nand liquidity buffers will have to be raised, and the buildup of capital buffers and provisions in \ngood times should be encouraged so that capital can absorb losses and be drawn down in \ndifficult times, such as the current period. It will  be necessary to develop a methodology to \nlink the stage in the business cycle to capital requirements in a nondiscretionary way and to \naccounting  and  prudential  standards.  Broad  agreement  is  now  emerging  in  the  Basel \nCommittee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the FSB that capital buffers have to be built \n                                                \n35 FSB (2009). \n\n36 CCMR (2009). \n\n37 FSB (2009); CCMR (2009). \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nin  to  constrain  procyclical  buildup  of  leverage  in  financial  institutions.  In  addition  to  the \nchanges  being  proposed  to  raise  capital  adequacy  norms,  minimum  global  liquidity \nstandards  are  also  being  explored  along  with  greater  requirements  for  countercyclical \nprovisioning.  The  implementation  of  these  new  standards  then  should  be  effective  in \nconstraining the procyclical buildup of leverage in financial systems on an automatic basis. \n\n Many  questions  have  also  arisen  about  accounting  conventions  and  procedures  that  are \nperceived  to  add  to  procyclicality  in  the  financial  system.  It  should  be  recognized  that  the \nclock  should  not  be  turned  back  on  fair  value  accounting  just  to  address  the  issue  of \ntemporary market illiquidity. What is needed is to make clear the nature of price uncertainty \nand to do so in a manner that symmetrically addresses the potential for mispricing in illiquid \nmarkets  as  well  as  in  booming  markets.  Improvements  could  include  better  guidance  and \nprinciples  for  mark-to-market  valuation,  information  on  the  variance  around  the  fair  value \ncalculations, and data on historic prices. \n\n4.2.4  Prudential Oversight \n\nThere  are three  broad  areas  with  regard  to  prudential  oversight that require  strengthening: \ncapital  adequacy  framework,  liquidity  risk  management,  and  infrastructure  for  OTC \nderivatives. \n\n4.2.4.1  Capital Adequacy Framework \n\nThere is a clear recognition of the need for higher quantity and quality capital; this will result \nin minimum regulatory requirements that significantly exceed existing Basel thresholds. The \nemphasis is on increasing the quantity and quality of tier 1 capital. It is being proposed that \nonly common equity shares and retained earnings be counted toward tier 1 capital. As these \ntougher requirements are introduced, it is understood that the transition to future standards \nneeds to be carefully phased given the importance of maintaining bank lending in the current \nmacroeconomic climate. In view of the serious problems that arose from lower risk weights \nbeing  attached  to  assets  in  the  trading  book,  there  is  also  agreement  that  the  capital \nrequired against trading book activities should be increased significantly. Published accounts \ncould  also  include  buffers  to  anticipate  potential  future  losses,  through,  for  instance,  the \ncreation  of  an  \u201ceconomic  cycle  reserve.\u201d  There  is  also  increasing  agreement  on  the \nintroduction  of  a  maximum gross  leverage  ratio as  a  backstop  discipline  against  excessive \ngrowth  in  absolute  balance  sheet  size. 38\n In  addition,  in  the  context  of  rapid  financial \ninnovation and risk-based regulatory capital requirements, a well-constructed non-risk-based \ncapital  measure  can  at  least  partially  address  the  problem  of  modeling  deficiencies  for  the \nadvanced approaches and ensure that a minimum level of capital is retained in the banking \nsystem. \n\n4.2.4.2  Liquidity Risk Management \n\nA  new  element  in  the  future  regulatory  approach  is  explicit  recognition  that  liquidity \nregulation  and  supervision  must  be  given  the  same  emphasis  as  capital  regulation. 39\n \nIndividual institutions have demonstrated that their own internal incentive structures are such \nthat  liquidity  risk  may  be  procyclical  due  to  its  links  with  market  and  credit  risk  and  to \naccelerator  factors,  such  as  the  mark-to-market  effects  of  asset  values  and  net  worth. \nStructural reliance on short-term wholesale market funding, including via securitization, has \nincreased the sensitivity of banks\u2019 balance sheets and cost of funds to procyclical elements. \nSome  regulators  were  already  giving  attention  to  such  issues.  The  Reserve  Bank  of  India, \nfor instance, places prudential limits on purchased overnight interbank liabilities and restricts \n\n                                                \n38 CCMR (2009); BCBS (2009b); FSB (2009); Institute of International Finance (IIF 2009). \n\n39 BCBS (2009a). \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nthe uncollateralized overnight market to commercial banks. It also monitors actively the ratio \nof  wholesale  purchased  funding  that  banks  have  to  their  more  stable  deposit  funding. \nTherefore, regulatory policies need to reflect appropriately the true price of funding liquidity \non financial institutions\u2019 balance sheets\u2014ensuring that the market does not rely excessively \non  the central  bank\u2019s  emergency  liquidity  support facility.  Policies  that could  be  considered \ninclude: \n\ni. \n\nii. \n\niii. \n\niv. \n\nv. \n\nimproved  funding  risk  management  by  strengthening  risk  management \nand governance and control; \n\nintroduction  of  minimum  quantitative  funding  liquidity  buffers  of  high-\nquality liquidity assets; \n\nimposition of a thirty-day liquidity coverage ratio; \n\na longer-term structural liquidity ratio; \n\nintroduction  of  a  regulatory  charge  for  institutions  that  present  a  higher-\nthan-average liquidity risk, and pricing of access to central bank liquidity \nin order to encourage institutions holding better quality collateral; and \n\nvi. \n\nrequiring global banks to have sufficient high-quality liquid assets. \n\nAn  effective  global  framework  for  managing  liquidity  in  large,  cross-border  financial \ninstitutions  should  include  internationally  agreed  levels  of  liquidity  buffers  and  should \nencourage  an  increase  in  the  quality  of  their  composition.  Such  a  framework  needs  to  be \ncomprehensive  and  take  into  account  overall  liquidity  needs.  In  the  ongoing  discussion \nrelated  to  enhanced  requirements  for  mandating  liquidity  buffers,  there  is  some  debate  on \nthe choice of instruments that will qualify as high-quality liquid instruments: will they include \nonly  treasuries,  or  will  high-quality  corporate  bonds  also  qualify?40\n Again,  for  example,  the \nReserve  Bank  of India  has  long  imposed  a  25% \u201cstatutory  liquidity ratio\u201d on  all commercial \nbanks:  25%  of  their  net  demand  and  time  liabilities  have  to  be  invested  in  government \nsecurities. The financial industry would clearly like to broaden the kinds of instruments that \nwould  be  acceptable,  but  the  implication  of  such  broadening  would  be  that  central  banks \nalso would have to broaden the collateral that they accept for their liquidity operations. \n\n4.2.4.3 \n\nInfrastructure for OTC Derivatives \n\nAs  documented,  the  explosion  of  credit  derivatives  and  their  offshoots  (such  as  CDOs  and \nCDOs-squared)  has  demonstrated  the  clear  need  for  oversight  and  transparency  in  this \nmarket. The market for credit default swaps (CDSs) operates on a bilateral, OTC basis and \nhas grown to many times the size of the market for the underlying credit instruments. In light \nof  problems  involving  some  large  players  in  this  market,  attention  has  focused  on  the \nsystemic  risks  posed  by  CDSs.  There  is  a  global  consensus  on  the  need  for  centralized \nclearing  and  a  central  counterparty (CCP) for  all  the OTC  derivative  products.  Accordingly, \nefforts are on in the US, the European Union, and elsewhere to implement CCPs for CDSs. \nThere is general agreement that standardized contracts should be conducted on designated \nexchanges,  while  the  remaining  OTC  trades  also  should  be  cleared  centrally.  They  would \nthen be subject to the scrutiny of a central counterparty and would have mandatory reporting \nrequirements on a transparent platform.41\n \n\nThe development of a CCP facilitates greater market transparency, including the reporting of \nprices  for  CDSs,  trading  volumes,  and  aggregate  open  interest.  The  availability  of  pricing \ninformation  can  improve  the  fairness,  efficiency,  and  competitiveness  of  markets\u2014all  of \nwhich  enhance \nformation.  The  degree  of \n                                                \n40 IIF (2009). \n\ninvestor  protection  and \n\nfacilitate  capital \n\n41 BCBS (2009b); IIF (2009); Warwick Commission (2009). \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\ntransparency, of course, depends on the extent of participation in the CCP. If needed, some \nincentives  may  be  provided  by  national  authorities,  for  example,  by  taking  a  higher  capital \ncharge  for  transactions  not  cleared  through  central  counterparties.  If  capital  requirements \nare related to the counterparty risk exposures that arise from derivatives, repos, and security \nfinancing  activities,  it  will  incentivize  institutions  to  increase  OTC  derivative  exposure  to \nCCPs and exchanges while also reducing the probability of contagion when problems arise. \nTo  foster  transparency  and  promote  the  use  of  a  CCP  and  of  exchange  trading  for  credit \nderivatives,  public  authorities  should  also  encourage  the  financial  industry  to  standardize \ncontracts  and  use  a  data  repository  for  the  remaining  nonstandardized  contracts,  and  to \npromote  fair  and  open  access  to  central  counterparty  services.  The  use  of  a  CCP  will \nnaturally  lead  to  higher  costs  in  OTC  trading,  which  would  itself  lend  some  stability  to  the \nsystem. \n\nA  CCP  mechanism  already  exists  for  clearing  and  settling  all  interbank  spot  forex \ntransactions and all outright and repo transactions in government securities. Nonguaranteed \nsettlement  of  OTC  trades  in  interest  rate  swaps  also  commenced  in  2008.  Guaranteed \nsettlement  of  interest  rate  swap  (IRS)  and  forex  forwards  is  a  work  in  progress  at  an \nadvanced stage. \n\nIndia  already  has  an  institution  (the  Clearing  Corporation  of  India)  for  centralized  clearing \nand settlement of all interbank spot forex transactions and all outright and repo transactions \nin government securities. Nonguaranteed settlement of OTC trades in IRSs has also started. \nWork is now under way on guaranteed settlement of IRS and forex forwards.42\n \n\n There is also some debate on the number of CCPs that are needed to foster stability in a \nsystem.  Some  argue that to  mitigate  systemic risk  resulting from counterparty  credit risk,  it \nwould be beneficial to have a competitive environment for central counterparties, but without \nimposing  regulatory  requirements  that  unduly  fragment  the  market.  Others  argue  that \nbecause  of  netting  in  a  clearing  house  with  a  central  counterparty,  overall  risk  is  reduced \nsubstantially,  and  hence  only  one  or  two  clearing  houses  are  needed  in  any  particular \nsystem.\n\n It must be ensured, however, that the CCP is adequately funded. \n\n43\n\n4.2.4.4  Compensation \n\nAmong the issues that have gained prominence as contributory factors to the emergence of \nthe global financial crisis is the explosion of remuneration in the financial sector, particularly \nin  comparison  with  trends  in  the  rest  of  the  economy.  Much  more  attention  is  now  being \ngiven to the development of sound practice principles by the international standard setters. It \nis important that reforms in this regard be done on an industry-wide basis so that improved \nrisk management and compensation practices by some systemically important firms are not \nundermined by the unsound practices of others. Among the proposals being discussed is the \nprinciple that there must be a link between overall firm performance and individual bonuses \ngiven;  this  is  in  response  to  the  observation  that  large  bonuses  are  given  even  if  the  firm \nmaking  losses.  Another  principle  being  enunciated  is  that  guaranteed  bonuses  should  be \neither  prohibited  or,  at  a  minimum,  be  subject  to  limitations.  In  any  case,  there  is  general \nagreement that bonuses should be aligned with the long-term performance of the firm rather \nthan with short-term profits. \n\nIn  view  of  the  compensation  practices  that  have  been  observed  even  after  the  financial \ncrisis, there  is  no  doubt that there  will  be  greater  supervisory  oversight  over  compensation \npractices for some time to come. At the present time, financial institutions have returned to \nprofitability, to a great extent due to the extraordinary official measures taken to stabilize the \nfinancial  system.  The  market  mechanism  does  not  seem  to  ensure  that  these  profits  are \n                                                \n42 Gopinath (2009). \n\n43 CCMR (2009). \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nretained in financial institutions to bolster their capital. The firms that benefited from Troubled \nAsset Relief Program funds have preferred to return the funds as soon as they could rather \nthan submit to regulatory limitations on compensation that they would have been subject to \notherwise. Some feel that restricting dividend payments, share buybacks, and compensation \nrates  is  an  appropriate  way  to  constrain  the  kind  of  excessive  compensation  practices \nobserved.44\n \n\n Along with the enunciation of such principles and practices, it is important to look carefully at \nthe inherent market incentive structure that has led to the observed compensation practices \nin the financial sector. Acting on this flawed incentive structure is more likely to be effective \nthan regulatory prescriptions. \n\nThere is a need to question further the focus on compensation in the financial sector: is the \ncompensation  issue  actually  a  red  herring?  Is  it  not  the  explosion  in  intrafinancial  sector \ntransactions  and  excess  profitability  of  financial  institutions  that  has  led  to  the  very  high \ncompensation levels of their employees along with the high returns to shareholders? If a firm \nhas  such  high  returns,  they  have  to  go  somewhere:  they  are  either  distributed  to \nshareholders  or  to  the  employees  or  a  combination  of  both,  which  is  what  has  been \nhappening. In this case, it is then difficult to restrict compensation levels as is being argued \ncurrently. If the distribution of profits goes disproportionately to management and employees, \nthen the question relates to corporate governance practices. Why do boards not act more in \nthe  interest  of  shareholders?  Much  of  the  discussion  has  veered  off  into  the  minutiae  of \ncompensation practices related to the various forms in which compensation is given. To my \nmind, the real question relates to the high profitability observed in recent years in segments \nof the financial sector. \n\nTherefore, the question really is, is there a lack of competition in the financial sector? And if \nso  why?  Are  there  some  regulatory  provisions  that  restrain  competition,  or  are  there  some \nentry barriers inherent in the structure of the financial industry? If competition is not lacking, \nthen why are these profits not competed downward? And again, if the answer is indeed that \nthere is a lack of competition, what can be done? What kind of competition policy measures \nwould  be  relevant  and  applicable  to  the  financial  sector?  Addressing  these  questions  is \nprobably  more  useful  for  addressing  the  compensation  issue  than  focusing  narrowly  on \ncompensation patterns and levels. \n\n4.2.4.5  Risk Management \n\nThe  fundamental  weaknesses  in  risk  management  practices  revealed  in  the  current  crisis \nwere  the  inability  of  financial  institutions  to  adequately  monitor  risk  concentrations  across \nproducts and geographic areas, shortcomings in stress testing, and inappropriate practices \nfor  managing  risks  arising  from  structured  products.  First  and  foremost,  it  remains  the \nresponsibility  of  the  private  sector  to  take  the  lead  in  strengthening  firmwide  risk \nmanagement frameworks.  Both management and the board of directors are responsible for \ninstituting adequate risk management and control systems. Generally, banks are expected to \nhave in place effective internal policies, systems, and controls to identify, measure, monitor, \nmanage, control, and mitigate their risk concentrations in a timely manner and under various \nconditions,  including  stressed  market  situations.  The  supervisory  authorities  would  have  to \noversee compliance of such best practices for capturing firmwide risk concentrations arising \nfrom  both  on-  and  off-balance-sheet  exposures  and  securitization  activities.    For  example, \nwith  respect  to  OTC  derivative  markets,  it  is  being  proposed  that  capital  requirements  be \nstrengthened  to  reflect  the  actual  risk  of  OTC  derivatives.  In  deriving  such  capital \nrequirements,  it  is  also  being  proposed  that  new  standards  be  devised  to  account  for \ncounterparty risks. When trading is done on an exchange or with a central counterparty, the \n\n                                                \n44 FSB (2009). \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\ncapital requirement would naturally be lower, thereby incentivizing firms to minimize bilateral \nOTC trading. \n\n4.2.4.6  Transparency \n\nGiven the serious problems that have arisen, there clearly needs to be greater emphasis on \nincreasing the transparency of the techniques, data characteristics, and caveats involved in \nthe  valuation  of  complex  financial  instruments;  improved  information  regarding  OTC \nderivatives  markets  and  clearing  arrangements;  and  better  reporting  of  exposures  in  a \nformat that permits regulators to aggregate and assess risks to the system as a whole. This \nwould help investors perform some of the due diligence currently outsourced to credit rating \nagencies while also helping the latter to do better in measuring the tail risks. \n\nThe  fundamental  issue  here  is  twofold:  standard  setters  should  work  with  supervisors  and \nregulators, first, to reduce complexity in accounting standards to facilitate better assessment \nof  uncertainty  surrounding  valuation,  and  second,  to  achieve  consistency  of  valuation \nmethods and a single set of accounting standards. \n\n4.2.4.7  Enforcement \n\nInternational standards (including those for macroprudential regulation), scope of regulation, \ncapital  adequacy,  and  liquidity  buffers  should  be  coordinated  to  ensure  a  common  and \ncoherent  international  framework  that  national  financial  authorities  should  apply  in  their \ncountries, consistent with national circumstances. The expanded Financial Stability Forum\u2014\nnow  renamed  the  Financial  Stability  Board\u2014the  International  Monetary  Fund,  and  the \ninternational  standard  setters  could  assume  this coordination  role. In  addition,  the financial \nregulatory and oversight frameworks and their implementation in all G20 countries should be \nreviewed periodically, validated internationally, and made public. \n\n5.  THE CHALLENGES AHEAD \n\nThe  agenda  that  is  being  developed  for  strengthening  financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision  is  ambitious.  Contentious  issues  are  arising  both  at  domestic  regulatory  levels \nand  at  the  international  level  regarding  regulatory  cooperation. Whereas the  principles  that \nhave  been  outlined  for  this  regulatory  overhaul  are  increasingly  well  accepted,  many \nchallenges will arise regarding their modes of implementation and their practicality. \n\n5.1  Regulatory Structure and Authority \n\nFirst,  there  is  much  discussion  in  many  jurisdictions  on  the  changes  needed  in  regulatory \nstructure to minimize the probability of such a financial crisis arising again. There is general \nagreement  on  the  need  to  establish  a  regime  of  macroprudential  regulation  and  financial \nstability oversight, and these regimes will need to be more effective over the economic cycle.  \nThe issue under discussion in different jurisdictions is, who will do it? Would it be a council of \nregulators,  the  central  bank,  or  the  treasury?  The  core  concern  behind  such  discussion \nrelates to the location of responsibility for maintaining financial stability. Should central banks \nbe  made \nfinancial  stability? \nMacroprudential  regulation  is  increasingly  seen  as  one  of  the  key  means  for  maintaining \nfinancial  stability.  It  entails  the  imposition  of  prudential  regulations  whenever  some \nmacroeconomic  or  overall  financial  trends  require  action.  If  the  central  bank  is  only  a \nmonetary  authority,  and  a  separate  agency,  like  the  Financial  Services  Authority  of  the \nUnited Kingdom, is responsible for financial regulation and supervision, how is coordination \nto  be  achieved  so  that  such  action  can  be  implemented?  The  US  has  a  very  fragmented \nregulatory  structure,  whereas  the  United  Kingdom  has  placed  all  regulatory  responsibilities \nfor  all  segments  of  the  financial  sector  with  the  unified  FSA.  The  US  Federal  Reserve \n\nresponsible,  and  also  accountable, \n\nfor  maintaining \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nSystem  does  have  significant  regulatory  responsibilities,  but  regulatory  failures  were \nsignificant  in  all  North  Atlantic  financial  systems,  with  the  exception  of  Canada.  So  it  is \ndifficult to cite any existing system as comprising best practice. \n\nThe US Treasury has proposed the following: \n\ni. \n\nii. \n\niii. \n\niv. \n\nformation  of  a  Financial  Sector  Oversight  Council,  to  be  headed  by  the \ntreasury  secretary,  to  coordinate  all  the  regulators,  and  the  chairman  of \nthe US Federal Reserve would be one among all the other regulators in \nsuch a council; \n\nunification of all banking regulation in a single agency; \n\ncreation of a new agency for consumer protection in the financial sector; \nand \n\nassigning  greater  responsibility \nmaintaining financial stability. 45\n \n\nto \n\nthe  US  Federal  Reserve \n\nfor \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the FSA has been made responsible for macroprudential regulation \nwhile  the  Bank  of  England  retains  the  responsibility  for  financial  stability.  Meanwhile,  the \nopposition  Conservative  Party  has  announced  that  it  will  merge  the  FSA  with  the  Bank \nEngland  should  it  come  to  power  in  the  next  elections.  All  such  proposals  will  have  to \nundergo legislative approval in their respective jurisdictions. As of now, there is no emerging \nconsensus with respect to the best regulatory structure for maintaining financial stability. \n\nI have perhaps a biased view, having been in a central bank, though I have also worked in \nthe  treasury.  I  really  do  not  believe  that  effective  macroprudential  oversight  or  financial \nstability  oversight  can  be  done  without  the  central  bank  being  at  the  helm  of  this  activity.  \nAny kind of group can be set up, depending on the country\u2019s overall regulatory framework, \nand can include the treasury and the heads of the other regulatory entities. The central bank \nis the lender of last resort; it is also the only agency that has an overall view of the economy, \nalong with exceptional stability in terms of staffing and continuity in thinking, relative to most \ntreasuries. It should have its ear to the ground with respect to evolving developments in all \nfinancial markets if it is doing its job well as a monetary authority. \n\nSince  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  is  the  monetary  authority  and  also  the  financial  sector \nregulator, it has been able to supplement its monetary policy very effectively with prudential \nactions on a consistent basis. It regularly monitors credit aggregates, including movements \nin sectoral credit. Consequently, it took action when it observed excess credit growth, both \non an aggregate basis and in particular sectors like real estate and housing. So it increased \nthe  cash  reserve  ratio  to  curb  overall  credit  growth  and  imposed  higher  risk  weights  for \nlending  in  the  affected  sectors.  As  part  of  its  supervisory  activities,  it  also  monitors  the \nincremental  credit  deposit  ratio  carefully  and  cautions  banks  when  such  a  ratio  is  found  to \nexceed  acceptable  norms.  It  is  also  able  to  do  forward-looking  countercyclical  capital \nbuffering  through  increases  in  loan  loss  provisioning  when  needed.  In  addition,  when  it \nobserved  regulatory  arbitrage  being  practiced  by  the  lightly  regulated  nonbank  finance \ncompanies during 2005\u201307, it took measures to tighten their regulation so as to reduce their \ncapacity to take on excess leverage. This experience is a valuable example for practicing the \nkind  of  proposals  being  put \nimplementing  macroprudential  polices  as \nforward \nsupplements to monetary policy as normally practiced in a narrow fashion. \n\nfor \n\nI  do  believe  that  given  different  countries  with  large  variations  in  institutional  legacies, \ntraditions, and systems, no one size can fit all. But at the same time, I think that the central \nbank does need to have a lead role as far as financial stability is concerned within any kind \nof  arrangement  that  is  deemed  fit  in  a  particular  country.  As  a  recent  IMF  paper  notes:  \u201cIf \none accepts the notion that, together, monetary policy and regulation provide a large set of \n                                                \n45 U.S. Department of the Treasury (2009). \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\ncyclical  tools,  this  raises  the  issue  of  how  coordination  is  achieved  between  the  monetary \nand the regulatory authorities, or whether the central bank should be in charge of both. The \nincreasing trend toward separation of the two may well have to be reversed. Central banks \nare obvious candidates as macro prudential regulators.\u201d46 In any case, there is a clear need \nfor  a  comprehensive  approach  to  regulatory  risk  in  the  financial  sector,  particularly  as  the \nperimeter  of  financial  regulation  is  widened  to  encompass  hitherto  unregulated  or  lightly \nregulated entities such as hedge funds, credit rating agencies, and other nonbank financial \ncompanies.47\n \n\n5.2 \n\nImpact of Proposed Regulatory Changes \n\nThe  various  proposals  that  are  under  discussion  with  respect  to  enhanced  capital \nrequirements will lead to increased levels of regulatory capital over the economic cycle, and \nextension of such capital requirements to bank-like institutions that are currently unregulated \nor lightly regulated will inevitably lead to lower profitability for equity investors. In addition to \nthe  increases  in  basic  capital  adequacy  that  are  being  considered,  other  proposals  under \ndiscussion include: \n\nhigher  quality  tier  1  capital  to  consist  of  only  common  shares  and \nreserves, \n\ni. \n\niii. \n\niv. \n\nv. \n\nii.  maintenance of countercyclical capital buffers, \n\ncountercyclical provisioning, \n\nhigher risk weights for trading instruments, and \n\nhigher  capital \ninstitutions (for example, institutions with assets exceeding $250 billion). \n\nfor  systemically \n\nrequirements \n\nimportant \n\nfinancial \n\nThe bargaining power of banking institutions had become weak in the wake of the financial \ncrisis;  hence  there  was  little  initial  observable  protest  regarding  such  proposals.  As  the \nfinancial  crisis  is  resolved  and  as  some  semblance  of  normalcy  and  profitability  begins  to \nreturn  to  the  financial  sector,  the  financial  industry  is  likely  to  do  its  utmost  to  resist  the \nrequirements for higher capital. It will be a challenge for regulators and governments to resist \ndemands for relaxation of the new capital requirements, both the enhanced minimum levels \nand the capital buffers proposed for good times. The lobbying power of the financial industry \nwill  be  restored  by  that  time,  and  therefore  authorities  will  need  to  be  prepared  for  such \nchallenges.48\n Lower systemic profitability levels will also be effective endogenously in limiting \ncompensation levels in the financial sector. \n\nEveryone  seems  to  agree  that  there  is  need  for  increased  levels  of  regulatory  capital.  The \nkey problem that requires further analysis is that such a change implies lower profitability for \nthe financial sector. That in itself may not be such a bad idea for the maintenance of financial \nstability.  But there is still need for greater understanding of its implications for the financial \nsector as a whole. Would more stringent capital requirements imply a slower pace of credit \nintermediation  and  overall  lower  economic  growth?  Or  does  it  just  mean  that  there  will  be \nless intrafinancial sector activity, with negligible implications for the real economy? There is \nclearly a great need to work out the overall economic effects of the current recommendations \nrelated to the proposed regulatory overhaul. Such impact studies are now being conducted \nby the BCBS before the new capital standards are put in place. \n\n                                                \n46 Blanchard, Dell\u2019Ariccia, and Mauro (2010). \n\n47 CCMR (2009). \n\n48 For example, see IIF (2009). \n\n20 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\n5.3 \n\nImplementing Countercyclical Capital Requirements \n\nThe  proposal  for  provision  of  countercyclical  capital  will  face  significant  implementation \nissues.  Regulators  will  need  to  do  significant  technical  work  on  understanding  business \ncycles  so  that  turning  points  can  be  recognized.  What  would  be  the  triggers  for  changing \nthese capital buffers in either direction? Would these changes commence in anticipation of \nbusiness cycle turns or post facto?  How formal- or rule-based would these changes be so \nthat regulated institutions know in advance what they need to do?  An additional issue in this \nsphere arises from the possibility of economic cycles occurring at different times in different \njurisdictions.  This  would  necessitate  greater  cross-border  cooperation  between  home  and \nhost  regulators  in  terms  of  applicable  capital  requirements  for  different  segments  of  the \nsame  international  financial  conglomerate.  An  additional  problem  for  EMEs  would  be  the \nlack of adequate data for business cycle identification. \n\n5.4 \n\nIdentifying and Addressing Systemic Risks \n\nThere  is  general  agreement  on  the  need  for  macroprudential  regulations  and  the \nidentification of systemic risks such as the buildup of asset bubbles. However, considerable \ntechnical  work  will  need  to  be  done  at  both  national  and  international  levels  on  identifying \nwhat  such  risks  are,  what  is  systemic  and  what  is  not,  and  what kind  of regulatory  actions \nwould be effective. In the recent experience, for example, there was ample awareness of the \nbuildup  of  both  global  financial  imbalances  and  the  asset  price  bubble,  but  there  was  little \nagreement on what needed to be done. Even if adequate work is done to identify systemic \nrisk  and  determine  the  regulatory  measures  necessary,  what  will  be  the  enforcement \nmethodology \nto \ninterregulatory  cooperation  will  also  arise:  who  will  be  in  charge  of  issuing  early  warnings \nand who will listen to them? \n\ninternationally?  Within  national  regulatory  systems, \n\nissues  relating \n\n5.5  Defining What Is Systemically Important \n\n There  is  also  general  agreement  on  extending  regulation  to  all  systemically  important \ninstitutions, markets, and instruments. But here again there is an implementation issue:  how \nto decide what is systemically important. Certainly, all financial institutions that have access \nto  the  central  bank  liquidity  window  or  to  whom  the  central  bank  can  act  as  lender  of  last \nresort  should  be  subject  to  capital  regulation.  Considerable  debate  has  ranged  around  the \nregulation  of  hedge  funds,  which  come  in  all  sizes  and  forms.    Some  are  large  but  not \nleveraged,  others  can  be  both  large  and  leveraged,  and  yet  others  can  be  small  and \nleveraged or otherwise.  Whereas it may be that individual hedge funds or other equity pools \nare  not  systemically  important,  they  may  be  so  collectively.  Furthermore,  they  could  be \ncollectively  not  important  systemically  in  good  times  but  become  so  in  times  of  extensive \nleveraging.  A  similar  story  applies  to  markets  and  instruments.  Thus  national  and \ninternational  regulatory  systems  have  their  work  cut  out  for  them  in  this  regard,  especially \nsince excessive regulation could indeed snuff out entrepreneurship. \n\n5.6  Handling Securitized Credit \n\nA great deal of debate has emerged around the issue of securitized credit and its offshoots. \nWere financial  innovations  in  this  area  largely  unproductive  and  dysfunctional,  and  do they \nneed to be discouraged? That the explosion in the magnitude of such derivative instruments \ndid not provide any benefit to the financial system or the economy as a whole is now clear. \nHowever,  securitization  is  a  time-honored  practice  that  has  done  much  to  lubricate  the \nfinancial  system  and  helped  fund  real  economy  needs  at  competitive  costs.  So  how  these \ninstruments  are  regulated  and  how  the  \u201cgood\u201d  financial  innovations  will  be  winnowed  from \nthe \u201cbad\u201d will be a challenge. \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\n5.7 \n\nInternational Regulatory Cooperation Regulating Large, \nComplex Global Firms \n\nAs  the  current  global  crisis  has  shown,  whereas  many  of  the  large,  complex  financial \ninstitutions operate on a worldwide scale, their regulation is national. There is currently much \ndiscussion on how international regulatory cooperation can be improved, and there appears \nto  be  a  good  degree  of  consensus  emerging  in  the  standard-setting  bodies  regarding  the \ncontours  of  enhanced  regulation \ntheir \nrecommendations  will  rest  with  national  authorities  and  their  respective  legislatures.  The \ndomestic debates within national jurisdictions are much more fractious than those within the \ninternational  standard-setting  bodies,  and  the  financial  industry  has  much  greater  lobbying \npower within national borders and their respective legislatures and governments than among \nthe largely technocratic standard setters. Apart from the regulatory problems associated with \nongoing  institutions,  even  more  difficult  are  the  problems  associated  with  cross-border \nresolution of failing institutions. The discussion on these issues has just begun. \n\nimplementation  of \n\nfor  global \n\nfirms. 49\n\n But \n\n50 In  the  US,  there  has \nThere  is  also  increasing  debate  on  institutions  being  too  big  to  fail.\nbeen renewed debate on whether to reinstitute some Glass-Steagall type restrictions on the \nactivities that are allowed for banking institutions. Should banking be boring? Whereas there \nwould  appear  to  be  little  support  for  bringing  back  the  full  separation  between  commercial \nand  investment  banks,  broker-dealers,  and  insurance  companies,  there  is  emerging \nconsensus  that  banks\u2019  activities  in  proprietary  trading  should  be  curbed. 51\n   Banks  have \ndeposit insurance protection and also have access to lender of last resort facilities from the \ncentral bank. In times of liquidity stress, they can receive liquidity assistance from the central \nbank,  whereas  in  times  of  insolvency,  it  is  deposit  insurance  that  comes  to  their  rescue. \nThus,  if  banks\u2019  risk-taking  activities  result  in  stress,  their  losses  are  effectively  socialized. \nTherefore  some  curb  on  their  excessive  risk-taking  activities  is  justified.  The  recent \nexperience has shown that in times of extreme crisis and panic, as happened in late 2008 in \nthe  US,  even  institutions  that  are,  ex  ante,  not  entitled  to  central  bank  liquidity  support \neffectively  receive  it  if  they  are  deemed  to  be  systemically  important  and  hence  too  big  to \nfail. So apart from the issue of restrictions on banks\u2019 speculative activities, there is a general \nissue of financial institutions becoming too big on a global scale. \n\n5.8  Capital Account Management \n\nFrom  the  perspective  of  emerging  market  economies,  at  the  macrolevel,  the  volatility  in \ncapital flows has led to severe problems in both macroeconomic management and financial \nregulation.52\n These  capital  flows  have  been  influenced  significantly  by  the  extant  monetary \npolicy regimes in developed countries, and hence their volatility is not necessarily related to \neconomic conditions in the receiving economies. Excess flows, sudden stops, and reversals \nhave  significant  effects  on  EME  financial  sectors,  the  working  of  their  capital  markets,  and \nasset  prices,  and  hence  on  their  economies  as  a  whole.  Management  of  this  volatility \ninvolves  action  in  monetary  policy,  fiscal  management,  capital  account  management,  and \nalso financial market regulation. This will remain a challenge since there is little international \n\n                                                \n49 BCBS (2009b); FSB (2009); G20 Working Group 1 (2009). \n\n50 Scott, Schultz, and Taylor (2010). \n\n51 See Volcker (2010); Brady (2010); Schultz (2010). \n\n52 Committee on the Global Financial System (2009). \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\n \n\nMohan \n\ndiscussion  on  this  issue.  There  is,  however,  increasing  recognition  that  some  degree  of \ncapital controls may be desirable in such circumstances.53\n \n\n5.9  Exiting Accommodative Monetary Policy \n\nIn  response  to  the  crisis,  monetary  policy  has  been  loosened  substantially  in  major \nadvanced economies since the second half of 2007. Policy rates have been cut to near zero \nlevels, even lower than that in 2003\u201304, and financial systems have been flooded with large \nliquidity. Abundant liquidity is already being reflected in return of capital flows to EMEs, and \nthis  excess  liquidity,  if  not  withdrawn  quickly,  runs  the  risk  of  inducing  the  same  excesses \nand  imbalances  that  were  witnessed  during  2003\u201307,  including  the  likely  recycling  back  of \ncapital to the advanced economies. As the global economy starts recovery, a calibrated exit \nfrom  this  unprecedented  accommodative  monetary  policy  will  have  to  be  ensured  to  avoid \nthe recurrence of the financial crisis being experienced now. \n\n6.  CONCLUSION \n\nTo summarize, the emergence of the global financial crisis has led to a new wave of thinking \non  all  issues  related  to  both  monetary  policy  and  financial  regulation.  The  practice  of  both \nmonetary  policy  and  financial  regulation  had  tended  to  become  too  formula  bound  and \nhence  predictable. While  these  new  principles  are  being  debated,  it  is  important  to  realize \nthat in the face of unexpected developments that always arise in the financial sector, there is \nan  important  role  for  the  exercise  of  judgment  by  both  monetary  authorities  and  financial \nregulators. Whereas considerable  progress  has been  achieved  on  the  principles  governing \nthis  regulatory  overhaul,  very  significant  challenges  remain  on  the  implementation  issues \nthat will arise as a new regime takes hold globally. \n\n                                                \n53 For example, see Commission on Growth and Development (2010); Ostry and others (2010). \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 271 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nMohan \n\nBank for International Settlements. 2008. 78th Annual Report, 2007\u201308.

The global financial crisis is attributed to a variety of factors, such as \ndevelopments in the subprime mortgage sector, excessive leverage, lax financial regulation \nand supervision, and global macroeconomic imbalances. At a fundamental level, however, \nthe crisis also reflects the effects of a long period of excessively loose monetary policy in the \nmajor advanced economies during the early part of this past decade. The global financial \ncrisis has led to a new wave of thinking on all issues related to both monetary policy and \nfinancial regulation. The practice of both monetary policy and financial regulation had tended \nto become too formula bound and hence predictable. While these new principles are being \ndebated, it is important to realize that in the face of unexpected developments that always \narise in the financial sector, there is an important role for the exercise of judgment by both \nmonetary authorities and financial regulators. Whereas considerable progress has been \nachieved on the principles governing this regulatory overhaul, very significant challenges \nremain on the implementation issues that will arise as a new regime takes hold globally. \n \n \n \nJEL Classification: G01, G18 \n", " \n", " \n"]}
