INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Islamic finance is one of the fastest growing segments of international finance in the \nworld.1 The total worth of the Islamic finance industry across its three main sectors\u2014banking, \ncapital markets, and takaful2\u2014was estimated at $1.89 trillion in 2016,3 and global Islamic finance \nassets are forecast to reach $3.5 trillion by 2021.4 Based on the exponential growth and the \nincreasing importance of Islamic finance globally, the governments of Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan are seeking to further develop their respective Islamic \nfinance  industries.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \ndevelopment of the Islamic finance industries in these target Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) through (i) Islamic finance-related legal and regulatory \nreforms;  (ii)  capacity  building  for  governmental,  regulatory,  and  private  sector  entities  to \nstrengthen their ability to develop, regulate, and deliver Islamic financial services; and (iii) efforts \nto improve public understanding of the Islamic financial services available in their respective \nDMCs.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Asia is home to around 60% of the world\u2019s Muslims and is at the forefront of the \ndevelopment of Islamic finance. Its Islamic financial services industry accounts for 22.5% of global \nIslamic finance assets. Much of this growth stems from the efforts of specific Asian governments \n(e.g., Malaysia and Brunei) to support and develop their domestic Islamic finance industries. \nMalaysia\u2019s Islamic financial institutions hold 23.8% of the country\u2019s total domestic banking assets, \nand the country accounts for 9.3% of Islamic banking assets globally; in Brunei, Islamic banking \nnow accounts for 57% of the total domestic banking market (footnote 3). However, apart from \nthese developed markets, where growth of Islamic finance has been significant, the lack of legal, \nregulatory, and institutional structures and poor understanding of Islamic finance has restricted \nits development in Asia. \n \n3.  Islamic finance can be a source of infrastructure financing, enable portfolio diversification \nfor institutional and high net-worth investors, and serve as an alternative source of financing for \nlower-income  populations  that  prefer  Sharia-compliant  financial  services.  Sukuk  has  been \nincreasingly used recently to fund infrastructure development projects.6 The volume of annual \nsukuk issuances reached $75 billion in 2016, bringing the volume of outstanding sukuk close to \n$320  billion  (footnote  3).  Although  Muslim-majority  countries\u2014including  Brunei,  Indonesia, \nMalaysia, and Pakistan\u2014are leading the way in sukuk issuances, non-Muslim majority countries \nare increasingly looking towards sukuk to tap into a new investor base. The United Kingdom, \nHong Kong, China, and Luxembourg issued their inaugural sukuk in 2014, which were heavily \noversubscribed. Similarly, sukuk issued in Bahrain, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates have \nalso been vastly oversubscribed. Given the interest that sukuk are generating among global \ninvestors, infrastructure sukuk seems to be an effective instrument for countries to raise funds to \nsupport their development projects. \n \n                                                \n1  Islamic Financial Services Board. 2014.

Islamic Financial Services Industry Stability Report. Kuala Lumpur. \n4  Thomson Reuters. 2016. State of the Global Islamic Economy Report 2016/2017.  \n5   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 March 2016.   \n6  A sukuk is an investment instrument (traded like a conventional bond) that provides the investor with undivided \nownership of an underlying asset. \n ", "2  \n4.  Islamic finance may also increase financial inclusion. Some Muslim households abstain \nfrom opening conventional saving accounts because of their interest-generating feature, which is \nprohibited under Islamic jurisprudence. For example, in Afghanistan, 33% of adults surveyed in a \nrecent study cited religious reasons as a barrier to finance, compared to less than 2% in Malaysia \nand Kuwait.7 Islamic finance can serve as an alternative financing source for unbanked individuals \n(including women) who have refrained from using conventional financing services because of \nreligious considerations. \n \n5.  Despite its growth and potential, Islamic finance faces challenges, which are particularly \nevident in emerging Islamic finance markets, and include the following: \n \n (i)  Inadequate financial sector laws and regulations. Conventional financial sector \nlaws and regulations (including banking, taxation, and insurance regulations) do \nnot normally recognize the requirements of Islamic finance.8 A holistic legal and \nregulatory framework is needed to enable parity of treatment to enable Islamic \nbanks and conventional banks to operate on an equal footing).9  \n(ii)  Shortage of professionals. Outside the developed Islamic finance markets, there \nare  insufficient  qualified  Islamic  finance  professionals  proficient  in  both \nconventional and Islamic financial principles. Training of government officers, \nregulators,  and  market  professionals  in  this  complex  area  of  expertise  is  \ncomplicated by the lack of opportunities to gain operational experience and acquire \na level of comfort through learning-by-doing in markets where Islamic finance is \nstill incipient. \n(iii)  Lack of public awareness. Apart from developed Islamic finance markets and \nsophisticated institutional investors, the public understanding and appreciation of \nIslamic finance is very limited, with many investors seeing it as a type of financing \nsolely for Muslims. However, investors can benefit from the risk diversification \nfeatures of Islamic financing, while the poor who have shunned conventional \nbanking for religious reasons can be provided with information on the benefits and \nrisks of Islamic finance products for savings purposes. \n \n6.  The selection criteria for the target DMCs included these challenges to the growth of \nIslamic finance in combination with an assessment of the potential for growth of Islamic finance \nin these countries. Pakistan has a relatively more advanced regulatory framework, and Islamic \nfinance has deeper market penetration; although capacity constraints remain evident and public \nawareness requires improvement, Pakistan\u2019s potential for growth is probably largest among the \ncountries that fall under ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department. Afghanistan\u2019s potential is also \npromising, but its regulatory framework is still in its infancy, capacity is severely limited, and public \nunderstanding (particularly in rural areas) is very low. In terms of their level of development, the \nremaining three target DMCs fit broadly between Afghanistan and Pakistan. In Kazakhstan, the \nAstana International Financial Centre was established in 2016 with the objective of transforming \nthe country into a regional hub for Islamic finance in Central Asia by 2020. The financial hub is \ncurrently in the process of developing a comprehensive regulatory framework for its Islamic \n                                                \n7  Malaysia  International  Islamic  Finance  Center.  2014.

For \nexample, the tax systems (including land tax and stamp duties) in many countries have historically catered for \nconventional finance, and Islamic finance products typically do not come to enjoy equal treatment. \n ", "  3 \nfinancial system. Kazakhstan currently has one full-fledged Islamic bank, the Al-Hilal Bank. In \n2014, Tajikistan adopted legislation introducing Islamic banking in the country. The legislation \ndefines the scope of Islamic banking operations and sets out the licensing requirements for \nfinancial  institutions  intending  to  operate  in  accordance  with  Sharia-compliant  principles. \nFollowing approval of the Islamic banking legislation, Bonki Rushdi Tojikiston, a Tajikistan-based \nbank, signed an agreement with the private sector arm of the Islamic Development Bank to \nsupport its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic Bank, which is expected to be the first Islamic bank \nin the country. With respect to the Kyrgyz Republic, according to the International Finance \nCorporation, almost 80% of the country\u2019s micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises have \nindicated their strong preference for Islamic banking products and services.10 However, regulatory \nimpediments have resulted in slow growth of Islamic finance in the Kyrgyz Republic, with only one \nIslamic bank currently operating in the country. Therefore, although the constraints across these \ntarget DMCs are similar, each DMC has unique challenges that requires tailoring of the various \ninputs.  \n \n7.   The proposed TA is designed to address the key constraints in the development of a \nholistic Islamic finance sector in the target DMCs, and thereby contribute to the sustainability and \nlong-term growth of Islamic finance sectors in these DMCs. The proposed TA will build on \nprevious regional ADB TA for Islamic finance sector development;11 one lesson (from the 2009 \nTA project) is that a framework is needed to assist the sharing, by countries that already \nimplemented Islamic finance standards, of their implementation experience with countries that seek \nto achieve that. The proposed TA aims to facilitate such cross-border dialogue between DMCs.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.   The TA is aligned with the following impact: an effective and well-functioning Islamic \nfinance sector operating in the target DMCs developed. The TA will have the following outcome: \nIslamic finance in the target DMCs expanded.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods and Activities \n \n9.   Experience in established Islamic financial markets indicates that once a robust legal and \nregulatory framework is established, market forces ensure the sustainability of the Islamic finance \nsector. Accordingly, ensuring Islamic finance sector sustainability requires that (i) an appropriate \nregulatory framework is in place;13 (ii) regulators develop sound technical knowledge of Islamic \nfinance products such that they can provide appropriate regulatory oversight and can regulate \ninnovative Islamic financial products that the private sector may develop; and (iii) consumers are \naware of available Islamic financial products, and the products are considered compliant with \n                                                \n10 International Finance Corporation. 2016.

Manila, which sought to harmonize Islamic \nprudential standards, data collection and risk measurement in selected common member countries of ADB and the \nIslamic Financial Services Board.  \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 Several Islamic financial products require multiple transactions to achieve functional equivalence with conventional \ncounterparts, and are subject to additional tax burdens under most existing legal and tax systems. Countries seeking \nto develop indigenous Islamic financial markets should consider taxation and regulatory changes. \n ", "4  \nIslamic jurisprudence.  \n \n10.   Output 1: Legal and regulatory reforms in Islamic finance commenced. A gap \nanalysis will be carried out in each DMC to identity (i) gaps and impediments in current legislative, \nregulatory, and institutional frameworks (including banking, taxation, insurance, and governance); \nand (ii) the legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms required to support development of a robust \nIslamic finance system within the DMC.14 Based on the gap analyses, legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional reforms will be recommended for the target DMCs. Subsequent to ADB and DMC \nendorsement, draft legislation and regulations will be prepared.  \n \n11.   Output 2: Regulatory and private sector capacity to deliver Islamic finance services \nstrengthened. Relevant governmental departments, regulatory bodies (such as central banks \nand securities and exchange commissions), and private sector participants in the target DMCs \nwill receive training to improve governmental, regulatory, and private sector capacity for Islamic \nfinance. Training methods will include conferences, intensive workshops, and training courses \ndeveloped by expert consultants.15 Conferences will be held in Pakistan and Kazakhstan at the \nbeginning of the TA to discuss the impediments, issues, and scope for Islamic finance;16 a single \nconference to be held at the end of the TA implementation period will provide the opportunity to \nimprove collaboration and knowledge sharing among all target DMCs.    \n \n12.   Theoretical training for governmental, regulatory, and private sector participants will be \nfollowed by practical training initiatives, to enable them to identify priority public and private sector \nprojects in the target DMCs that may be financed through Islamic finance. Participants will be \ninstructed on how to structure Islamic finance transactions and prepare financing proposals for such \npriority projects. At least two of the priority projects (which may be financed by ADB) for which \nfinancing proposals have been developed will be earmarked for Islamic financing in the target DMCs.   \n \n13.  Output  3:  Public  understanding  of  Islamic  products  in  the  target  developing \nmember countries improved. This output will raise awareness by disseminating information to \nthe public\u2014via the media, including radio public service messages, brochures, and awareness \nevents, with a special effort to address a female audience\u2014on the benefits and risks of available \nIslamic finance products for saving and borrowing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.   The TA is estimated to cost $2,150,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.17 The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. Participating regulators in the target DMCs will provide counterpart staff, office \nspace, logistical support, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for Rural Finance Expansion. Manila. This \nTA undertook a legal examination of the Islamic finance regulatory framework and the draft banking bill in Afghanistan. \nThe Banking Law was subsequently passed, but no analysis has been done to determine whether the Banking Law \nincluded recommendations on how Islamic finance may be expanded under this new legislation. \n15 Capacity development under the TA will use a training of trainers\u2019 approach to maximize the impact of the capacity \ndevelopment initiatives. The TA will focus on providing intensive training to select governmental, regulatory, and \nprivate sector participants rather than generic trainings for many participants.   \n16 These will be subregional conferences; participants from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan will be invited to attend \nthe conference in Kazakhstan, and participants from Afghanistan will be invited to attend the conference in Pakistan. \nPrivate sector participants will be expected to finance their own attendance at these conferences.  \n17  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.   ADB will administer the TA through the Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade \nDivision of the Central and West Asia Department (CWPF) and the Office of the General Counsel \n(OGC). CWPF and OGC will devise coordination routines to enable effective joint leadership, and \nwill be jointly responsible for TA implementation and supervision. Consultant engagement and \nknowledge products will be collaboratively managed.18  \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2017\u2013December 2019 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank (ADB)  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultant selection  117 person-months  $1,253,000 \n  Consultants\u2019 qualification selection   16 person-months  $147,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16.   A combination of individuals and a firm (using consultants\u2019 qualification selection) will be \ncontracted, with regulatory, legal, capacity building, financial education, public communications, \nand project management expertise. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).19 To reduce the \nadministrative  burden  and  improve  economy,  efficiency,  and  value  for  money,  lump-sum \npayments and output-based contracts will be considered for consulting services under the \nproposed TA. All disbursements under the proposed TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.   All publications, training programs, seminars, and workshops financed under the TA will \nclearly indicate that the activities in question have received funding from the government of Japan; \nall press releases issued by ADB with respect to the TA will refer to the financial contribution from \nthe government of Japan; and the support of the government of Japan as a source of funding will \nbe acknowledged in all official notices, reports, and publications. \n \nIV.

In addition, where possible ADB will partner with public sector \nentities that have existing public awareness-raising initiatives to increase the impact of TA dissemination efforts.      \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \nItem  Amount \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Funda under the Regional   \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility  \n  1.
