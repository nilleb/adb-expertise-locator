THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) facility1 will provide project preparation \nsupport  to  a  series  of  ensuing  projects,  comprising  (i)  Uttar  Pradesh  Power  Distribution \nRehabilitation  Project  ($500  million);  (ii)  Meghalaya  Power  Sector  Improvement  Project           \n($150 million); and (iii) Tamil Nadu Power Transmission Improvement Project ($500 million).  \n \n2.  The Government of India has launched several initiatives to improve the technical and \nfinancial performance of electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs). These include the ongoing \ngovernment funded schemes (i) Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) for strengthening \nthe subtransmission and distribution network in urban areas; and (ii) Dindayal Upadhya Gram \nJyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) for strengthening the rural distribution network, separation of agricultural \nfeeders, rural electrification and metering of distribution transformers and feeders, and the \nrecently announced scheme for electrifying all unelectrified households by 2019.  \n \n3.  The Ministry of Power (MOP) has also obtained commitments from state governments to \nprovide 24x7 Power for All (24x7 PFA) to all households, industry and commercial consumers; \nand adequate power to agricultural consumers by 2019. To achieve this objective, the government \nhas  launched  the  Ujwal  DISCOM  Assurance  Yojana  (UDAY)  and  entered  into  tripartite \nagreements with state governments and DISCOMs to improve DISCOMs\u2019 financial performance \n(through debt restructuring) and technical performance envisaged under the IPDS and DDUGJY \nschemes. The investment requirement to achieve the technical performance improvement targets \nset under UDAY and 24x7 PFA is more than the government funding commitment to IPDS and \nDDUGJY schemes. There is a critical need for external financing to augment the domestic funding \nfor electricity distribution sector in India.  \n \n4.  The three ensuing projects to be prepared under the TRTA facility are of similar nature. \nThese projects are aligned with the objectives of 24x7 PFA, IPDA and DDUGJY. The projects aim \nto improve the quality of electricity supply, reduce aggregate technical and commercial losses, \nand improve the financial performance of DISCOMs. The outputs include (i) strengthening of  \nsubtransmission network; (ii) conversion of 11 kilovolts (kV) and 33 kV sub-transmission lines to \nunderground cables and low voltage lines with bare conductors to aerial bundled conductors in \nurban areas; (iii) additional distribution substations (33/11 kV) and distribution transformers to \nenhance distribution capacity; (iv) installation of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) \nsystems for real time network monitoring and operation; (v) installation of smart meters for large \nconsumers, feeders and distribution transformers; and (vi) installation of prepaid meters (for \nunmetered customers) or replacement of existing electromechanical meters to improve billing \nefficiency in rural areas; (vii) separation of agriculture and non-agriculture feeders, and pilot \ntesting of solar water pumping; and (viii) installation of new mini and small hydropower plants to \nincrease renewable energy generation. \n  \n5.  The state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Tamil Nadu are preparing \npreliminary project reports (PPR) on the three ensuing projects, to be endorsed by the Department \nof Economic Affairs (DEA) of the Government of India for Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n                                                \n1  The proposed TRTA facility is not included in the ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2018-2020.  \nManila. In a letter dated 10 October 2017, the Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India endorsed the \nTRTA facility and requested ADB\u2019s financial assistance. The South Asia Regional Department confirmed that such \nfinancial assistance can be accommodated under the 2017 resource envelope.   \n ", "2   \nfinancing. It is necessary to undertake surveys of existing electricity distribution network to identify \nthe investments required to improve the DISCOMs\u2019 performance, undertake detailed engineering \nplanning to optimize the network configuration and protection systems, and to prepare the \ntechnical specifications and bid documents. The implementing agencies do not have the staff \ncapable of undertaking these tasks and the TRTA facility will provide external consultants to assist \nin preparing the investment projects. The consulting requirement of ensuing projects will be \nupdated at the time of approval of concept papers of ensuing projects, and changes in scope of \nthe TRTA facility will be proposed in accordance with project administration instructions on \nadministering grant-financed TA projects.  \n   \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Network plan for rehabilitating electricity distribution network in Varanasi \nUttar  Pradesh  and  Meghalaya  completed.  Activities  include  (i)  detailed  surveys  of  the \ndistribution network to ascertain the condition of the network; (ii) network planning to optimize the \nnetwork  configuration;  and  (iii)  identifying  key  areas  to  reduce  aggregate  technical  and \ncommercial losses and improve reliability of the distribution network. Based on the network plan, \ntechnical specifications, engineering estimates, and bidding documents will be prepared.  \n \n7.  Output 2: Safeguard due diligence of small hydro projects in Meghalaya completed. \nThis will include identifying potential environmental and social issues, and defining the scope of \nenvironment, social studies, and technical studies to be undertaken to meet ADB\u2019s Safeguards \nPolicy Statement (2009) requirements.   \n \n8.  Output 3: Technical specifications for SCADA, smart and prepaid metering systems \nprepared to incorporate smart grid technologies such as (i) real time energy auditing at feeder \nlevel and distribution transformer level; (ii) real time transmission asset monitoring; and (iii) \ndemand response for urban distribution networks in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Meghalaya. \nDetailed survey and data collection of existing metering on distribution network will be undertaken \nto identify gaps and find optimal solutions covering various range of customers (industrial, rural \nand urban, etc.) for enhancing billing efficiency, and reducing pilferages. Data will also be \ncollected for future network reconfiguration and improvement. \n \n9.  Output 4: Diagnostic studies to identify possible investment opportunities in Tamil \nNadu and several other states completed. This will be undertaken as part of the preparation of \nproposed Tamil Nadu Power Transmission Improvement Project, but the coverage of sector \nassessments will include states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Panjab and Telangana. The financial viability \nand fiscal impact of investments (in terms of reduction of fiscal subsidy reduction) will be assessed. \nBased on the analysis, PPRs for ADB financing of proposed investments will be prepared for \nconsideration by relevant state governments, DEA and MOP.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TRTA facility is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others).
