The findings of the sector assistance program evaluation of the agriculture sector in \n2005 highlighted the need to base the engagements of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nthe sector on a robust analysis of the most efficient use of ADB resources in promoting national \nagriculture and rural development priorities. It further brought out the necessity of building on \nthe success of past program loans by focusing on the broader economic and policy constraints \non the performance of the sector, while not ignoring the physical investments required. \n \n2.  To apply these recommendations in its ongoing preparation of the country strategy and \nprogram  for  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  2007\u20132011,  ADB  held \nconsultations  with  the  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  on  ADB\u2019s  future  engagement  in  the \nagriculture and natural resources (ANR) sector. The Government and ADB agreed that an \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (ADTA)  would  be  prepared  and  policy  tools  and  investment \nopportunities would be identified to help catalyze and contribute to sector-wide outcomes.1 The \ntwo parties also agreed that a meaningful outcome would require extensive consultations with \nkey stakeholders, including provincial and national government institutions, and private sector \nrepresentatives. The ADTA should also take into account regional differences in resources, \nconstraints, requirements, and priorities. The concept paper for the ADTA was approved on 22 \nJune 2006.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The ANR sector of Lao PDR has a dominant role in the country, accounting for about \nhalf of the gross domestic product and 80% of employment. In addition, most of the poor in the \ncountry  depend  on  ANR  for  their  livelihood.  In  all,  about  620,000  households  depend  on \nagriculture for their livelihood; of these, about 75% still engage in subsistence farming. Women \nare  active  in  agriculture  and  form  60%  of  its  labor  force.  The  sector  comprises  diverse \nsubsectors ranging from crop production to livestock, fisheries, forestry, water resources, and \nnon-timber forest products. Its production systems, in a variety of agro-ecological zones, are \nalso diverse, ranging from rainfed and irrigated rice-based farming systems in the Mekong River \nvalley plains to shifting cultivation in upland areas and cash-crop and livestock production in \nupland plateau areas. Agriculture is still largely rice-based subsistence farming, and there have \nbeen no major changes in the last two decades in product diversification, value addition, and \nmarket orientation. Rice cultivation is the single most prevalent economic activity and takes \nplace on 72% of the total cultivated area. Rice is the staple food, accounting for about 67% of \ndaily calorie intake of most of the rural population. Recent dramatic increases in rice production, \nfrom 1.3 million tons in 1993 to 2.7 million tons in 2003 (due in part to an expansion in irrigated \narea,  as  well  as  the  adoption  of  improved  varieties  and  improved  on-farm  management \npractices), have helped reduce the incidence of rural poverty in recent years. The agriculture \nsector is expected to contribute even more significantly in the future to national economic \ngrowth, income, and employment for the bulk of the country\u2019s population. The challenge is how \nto promote the growth of the sector and to ensure that this growth benefits the majority of the \npoor in the rural areas. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 June 2006. \n ", "2 \n4.  Future growth faces manifold challenges. Although Lao PDR has a large land area, high-\nquality agricultural land is limited: less than 5% of the 236,800 km2 total is arable land and \npermanent  cropland.  Only  6%  of  the  land  has  slopes  below  20%.  The  suitable  land  for \nagriculture is further reduced by the presence of unexploded ordnance, which still causes injury \nand loss of life and stifles economic development. Moreover, much of the rural population, \noutside the Mekong River valley flood plains, is scattered over sparsely inhabited mountain \nareas hardly reached by new technologies. The capacity for increased production is further \nconstrained by limited irrigation facilities and potential in the lowland areas, limited access to \ninputs  and  credit,  poor  transport  infrastructure,  and  low  skills  among  farmers,  particularly \nwomen and upland ethnic communities. However, despite all of these constraints, agricultural \nproduction has considerable potential for expansion. Growth in the rural economy, particularly \nfrom  agricultural  activities,  is  driven  largely  by  better  opportunities  in  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) countries.  \n \n5.  The overall strategy of the Government is to develop the agriculture sector as well as the \nnonagricultural  sectors  in  the  rural  areas  to  create  employment,  increase  incomes,  and \nrestructure rural economies. There are plans to develop synergies between agriculture and \nemerging rural industries to increase the value of agricultural produce, especially for export. The \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has initiated a review of programs and strategies in \nirrigation, forestry, and commercial agriculture by a joint funding agency\u2013Government working \ngroup, with the objective of developing common guidelines for future investments and support \nservices. \n \n6.  Growth  in  agriculture  production  is  seen  as  a  major  means  of  promoting  overall \neconomic growth, and thus reducing poverty. While the domestic market for agricultural produce \nis limited, the GMS and Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional framework offers \nstrong  incentives  for  Lao  PDR  to  expand  opportunities  in  the  ANR  sector.  Agricultural \nproduction  in  several  locations  has  the  potential  for  diversification,  to  serve  such  external \nmarkets. It is, however, severely constrained by regulatory uncertainty, as coordination and \nenforcement must be effective at different levels. Developing the demand side of agriculture in \ndomestic and foreign markets will require a facilitating business environment. These and other \nconstraints,  including  access  to  financial  services,  and  lack  of  opportunities  for  capacity \ndevelopment of the public sector are affecting competitiveness and have limited the potential of \nthe  ANR  sector.  Overcoming  these  difficulties  will  require  an  in-depth  understanding  of \nmeasures for institutionalizing policy and regulatory reforms at the national and subnational \nlevels.  Given  this  analysis,  a  results-oriented  agricultural  investment  framework  with  well-\ndefined high-impact policy tools will need to be developed to promote competitive agriculture in \nLao PDR. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Output \n7.  The ADTA will facilitate the transition of the ANR sector in Lao PDR to a market-based \neconomy. The expected outcome is an integrated policy and investment framework focused on \nwell-defined,  high-impact  interventions  and  prioritized  investment  opportunities  to  intensify, \ndiversify, and commercialize agriculture wherever feasible. To this end, the technical assistance \n(TA) will (i) assess the current situation of agriculture and rural development in the country, (ii) \nassess past and ongoing interventions supported by ADB and other funding agencies, and \n(iii) consult with national and local stakeholders on where and how best to support interventions \n ", "3 \nin the future, and determine where ADB can invest for maximum impact. In addition, the TA will \nidentify  the  enabling  tools  for  institutionalizing  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  for \neconomically and socially viable investments, thereby providing the program framework for an \nintegrated rural investment strategy.  \n \n8.  After the ADTA, a planned subsequent project preparatory TA will package the program \nframework together with investment activities as the basis for an investment loan. To set the \nstage for this, the ADTA will (i) review past studies on the agriculture and rural development \nsectors  and  document  recent  developments;  (ii)  prioritize  major  issues,  challenges,  and \nconstraints; (iii) hold national and provincial consultations on the potentials for and constraints \non agriculture sector growth; (iv) identify constraints on the enabling environment for future \nagriculture sector growth and identify the reasons for and the sources of such constraints, as \nwell as measures that could be taken to overcome them; (v) identify critical capacity-building \nrequirements at both national and provincial levels that must be addressed; (vi) identify the \nphysical  constraints,  which  can  be  addressed  through  physical  investment,  such  as  the \nprovision of infrastructure, or capacity development; (vii) prioritize policy, institutional, or project \ninterventions that could facilitate growth and diversification in the sector; and (viii) prepare an \nintegrated policy and institutional framework for the agriculture sector. In identifying the drivers \nfor sustained agriculture and rural growth, special attention will be placed on regional challenges, \nthe role of the private sector, the capabilities of the public sector (especially in infrastructure, \nagriculture  support  services,  and  regulatory  framework),  regional  differences  in  investment \npriorities, and opportunities to leverage ADB resources for broad-based and widespread impact, \neither throughout the country or throughout the region. In analyzing such options, the aim will be \nto harmonize these investments with those of development partners in the sector. The TA, \nfollowing  extensive  consultations,  will  produce  a  full  discussion  of  proposed  policies  and \ninvestments, resource requirements, key milestones, and institutional processes required over \nthe next 5  to 10 years. See Appendix 1 for further details. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The ADTA will be implemented in two phases with the full participation of the national \nand provincial governments as well as other stakeholders at the national and provincial levels. \nPhase 1 will be undertaken by a core team consisting of ADB representatives, consultants, and \nkey line agency personnel. Activities to be undertaken will include (i) a thorough review and \nanalysis of past studies and strategies as well as the results of past investments in light of the \nfindings of the sector assistance program evaluation; (ii) rapid assessments and field surveys in \nkey agroecological regions to identify opportunities for agriculture sector growth as well as to \ndetermine and assess constraints for farmer-producers; (iii) observations and discussions on \nagriculture and rural development strategy with selected provincial governments; (iv) regional \nparticipatory  planning  workshops  with  provincial  governments;  (v)  the  preparation  of  a \ncomprehensive capacity development and skills transfer plan (for both national and provincial \ncounterparts); and (vi) the identification of opportunities, in summary form, and ways to take \nadvantage of those opportunities through a concerted effort to find solutions to major constraints \non crop diversification, market orientation, and value addition and thus facilitate rural growth. \nThe  consultants  are  also  expected  to  interact  with  traders  and  processors  in  the  region, \nincluding those in Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province in southern People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. The principal recommendations from phase 1 will be presented in a national workshop \nbefore being endorsed by the Government and ADB. \n \n ", "4 \n10.  Within 2 months of the completion of phase 1, the activities under phase 2 will begin with \nthe recruitment of the team leader. In this phase the policy and institutional framework required \nto  accelerate  rural  growth  through  agricultural  diversification  and  commercialization  will  be \nexamined.  National  and  provincial  mandates  and  policies  in  the  agriculture  sector  and \nassociated sectors will be analyzed, and any distortions, in theory as well as in practice, will be \nidentified. The issues to be addressed will include, among others: (i) nontariff restrictions on the \nfree movement of agriculture produce, including non-timber forest products; (ii) emerging issues \nrelated to commercial agriculture and the associated gender and ethnically differentiated issues \nrelated  to  access  to  land  and  natural  resources;  (iii)  the  financing  of  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of rural infrastructure, and (iv) the need to balance the development of crops \nintroduced on a large scale recently, such as rubber, sugarcane, corn, and soybeans. The \ninstitutional requirements for sustained support for commercial agriculture will also be assessed \nand recommendations made to develop and strengthen capacity, especially in the provinces. \n \n11.  TA team members, in consultation with national and provincial counterparts, will carry \nout an initial review of key areas of concern associated with the increased focus on agricultural \ndiversification and commercialization. These key concerns will include the need (i) to ensure \nequitable social impact, including the highest possible positive impact on women and ethnic \ngroups; and (ii) to avoid adverse effects on the environment and to promote sound ecological \npractices where possible. A final workshop or conference will also be held to disseminate the \nresults of the study and to plan the consolidation and further processing of an integrated \nframework with identified areas where ADB and other development partners can contribute. The \npossible contributions will include interventions to support capacity development, and policy and \ninstitutional measures considered critical in sustaining a higher level of investments in the sector. \nThe proposed implementation schedule is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA will cost about $890,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $750,000 equivalent on a \ngrant basis from its TA funding program. The national and provincial governments are expected \nto provide in-kind contribution of $140,000 equivalent for logistic support. See Appendix 3 for \nthe detailed cost estimates. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MAF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Key counterparts within MAF are likely to \ninclude  the  Permanent  Secretary,  and  relevant  staff  at  the  Information  Centre  and  at  the \nInternational Cooperation and Investment Division. The TA will be implemented over 12 months \nfrom the date of TA approval and concurrence of the Government, and will be completed by \n31 December 2007. An interministerial working group will be established to ensure the full \nparticipation of all relevant ministries in the project design. The working group will organize a \nseries  of  discussions  with  the  representatives  from  the  ministries  of  finance,  commerce, \ncommunications and transport, and foreign affairs; commercial banks; the Lao Women\u2019s Union; \nand representatives of farming communities and selected private sector groups. The provinces, \nand other relevant stakeholders including representatives from private sector organizations, the \nLao  National  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women,  the  Lao  National  Front  for \nReconstruction, and farmer-producer marketing groups and contract farming agribusinesses, \nwill be invited as needed. The national working group will help identify key counterpart staff in \nthe provincial agriculture and forestry offices and will facilitate dialogue with the provinces by \nestablishing provincial working groups. The provincial and district institutions concerned, the \nfarming community, women and ethnic communities, and the private sector will be represented \n ", "5 \nin these provincial working groups. These groups will meet at least once a quarter during the \nimplementation  period,  and  will  organize  focus  group  discussions  with  small  farmers  from \ndifferent farming systems, including upland ethnic groups, and women engaged in agriculture. \nThe provincial working groups will act as a sounding board for the proposals to be prepared \nunder the ADTA. They will actively participate in the formulation of all proposals to be prepared \nunder each of the two phases. \n \n14.  Phase  1  will  be  undertaken  over  a  4-month  period  by  a  team  consisting  of  two \ninternational experts (a rural sector economist and an institutions specialist), and three national \nexperts (a cropping systems and marketing specialist, a non-timber forest products marketing \nspecialist, and a gender development specialist). Start-up and documentary review will be \nundertaken during the first 4 weeks of the study. The following month will be dedicated to field \ntrips and visits to selected provincial governments. These will be followed by a series of regional \nworkshops over 6 weeks. In the final month, the consultants will (i) analyze and synthesize the \nstudy findings, (ii) outline the scope of an integrated policy, and (iii) draw up an investment \nframework. \n  \n15.  It is not possible at this stage to predict the specific needs for consulting services in \nphase 2. Those needs will depend on the results of phase 1, which must be carefully managed \nand endorsed by the national and provincial governments. Generally speaking, however, the \nteam  of  consultants  for  phase  2  is  expected  to  consist  of  specialists  in  (i)  agriculture \ndevelopment policy and institutions; (ii) rural finance and infrastructure; and (iii) agricultural \nmarketing, processing, and business development. Supplemental expertise in environmental \nimpact assessment and social impact assessment will also be provided. The total international \ninput will be about 22 person-months, and national consultants are expected to be recruited for \n20 person-months. The team for phase 1 will be led by an internationally experienced rural \nsector economist with extensive knowledge of the agriculture and rural development issues \nfacing Lao PDR. The terms of reference of the consultants are outlined in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  The consultants will be recruited in two packages (phase 1 and phase 2) according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Since each package will be relatively small, \ncompanies are not likely to be interested in bidding for the individual packages. Individual \ninternational and national consultants will thus be recruited.   \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Agriculture and Natural Resources \nSector Needs Assessment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING
