INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program, initiated in 2001, \naims to achieve development through cooperation, leading to accelerated economic growth and \nshared prosperity among the 10 partner countries, with the support of six multilateral institution \npartners.1 It has evolved from a consultative and project-based institutional framework to a more \nsector-strategy  and  results-oriented  approach  in  the  four  priority  sectors  of  energy,  trade \nfacilitation, trade policy, and transport. The program\u2019s objectives are expanding trade through \nimproved connectivity and openness, facilitating cross-border movements of goods and people, \nand enhancing energy cooperation. CAREC-related investments amounting to almost $17 billion \nwere approved and funded by member governments and multilateral institution partners in the \nprogram\u2019s first decade. Based on the findings of a stock-take report2 and an assessment of the \nopportunities and challenges facing the program, a new 10-year strategic framework, CAREC \n2020, was prepared and, subsequently, endorsed at the 10th Ministerial Conference in Baku, \nAzerbaijan, in November 2011. CAREC 2020\u2019s strategic objectives are expanded trade and \nimproved competitiveness (Appendix 1, Figure A1.1). In addition to the four priority sectors, its \noperational priorities include economic corridor development, the CAREC Institute, and selected \nsecond tier areas, such as climate change and communicable disease control.  \n \n2.  The CAREC Overall Institutional Framework (OIF)\u2014established in 2002 and governed \nby the Ministerial Conference (Appendix 1, Figure A1.2)\u2014has guided the program effectively \nthrough a flexible and informal structure. Key achievements of the OIF include (i) reaching \nconsensus on the principles of and approach to regional cooperation; (ii) formulating the vision, \ngoal, and strategic priorities of the program and its sectors of cooperation; (iii) coordinating and \nmonitoring the planning, preparation, and implementation of priority projects and initiatives; (iv) \nproviding  a  platform  for  regular  discussions  on  CAREC-related  concerns  among  the \nparticipating  countries, multilateral  institution  partners,  and  other key  stakeholders;  and (v) \nbuilding  confidence  among  countries  to  sustain  their  support  for  and  participation  in  the \nprogram. \n \n3.  Through the proposed technical assistance (TA),3 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill continue to assist the coordination of CAREC in the second decade of the program\u2014a \nprerequisite for the effective implementation of CAREC 20204\u2014supporting the national and \nregional mechanisms. It will build on earlier ADB \u2015umbrella\u2016 TA projects to support CAREC 2020 \nimplementation.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 2.  \n \n \n                                                \n1  CAREC member countries include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The six CAREC multilateral \ninstitution partners are the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, \nand the World Bank.  \n2  ADB. 2010. The 10-year Commemorative Study Part 1 (Stock-Take). Manila. \n3  VPO1 provided concept clearance for the TA on 9 April 2012. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB\u2019s website on 20 April 2012. \n4  The TA will also complement the outcomes and outputs of two other regional technical assistance projects planned \nfor 2012: Supporting Capacity Development Needs of CAREC 2020 and Assisting the CAREC Institute Knowledge \nProgram, Phase 1, which are dedicated to the capacity development and knowledge components of CAREC 2020. \n5  Earlier ADB TA projects comprise: (i) ADB. 2007. Strengthening Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, \n2007\u20132012. Manila (TA 6409-REG). (ii) ADB. 2005. Greater Silk Road Initiative 2006. Manila (TA 6272-REG). \n(iii) ADB. 2004.

The stock-take report (footnote 2) warns that ownership of and commitment to the OIF \nhas varied among member countries, with heavy reliance on assistance from the multilateral \ninstitution partners in programming and coordination. CAREC 2020, reflecting on the program\u2019s \nfirst decade and the key lessons of the stock-take report, called for gradual refinements of the \nOIF to improve its coordination of the CAREC program. These include: \n \n(i)  a more prominent role for the countries in the execution of the OIF, enhancing \ncountry ownership of the program;  \n(ii)  strengthened coordinating mandates of the national focal points (NFPs), ensuring \nthat they have the institutional capacities to bring about focused and accelerated \nimplementation of CAREC 2020; \n(iii)  a  stronger  role  for  the  senior  officials\u2019  meetings  (SOMs)  in  resolving  issues \nassociated with the implementation of CAREC 2020 through better intersectoral \ncoordination\u2014not only taking stock of progress as they have done in the past, \nbut proactively addressing policy issues and undertaking annual development \neffectiveness review, using the CAREC results framework; \n(iv)  greater consistency among member countries in the involvement of their sector \nfocal points in the work of the sector coordinating committees\u2014ensuring regular \nand  consistent  country  representation  at  each  committee  meeting,  and \nappointing participants at an appropriately senior level who are authorized to \nmake key decisions on CAREC policy and project issues; and \n(v)  a stronger interface with private sector institutions.  \n \n5.  With a strengthened OIF to actively manage the more focused agenda of CAREC 2020 \nand the OIF\u2019s highly satisfactory coordination of the program,6 stakeholders increasingly expect \nADB to step up its support to the OIF. The effective functioning of national and regional CAREC \nbodies under the OIF would facilitate the mainstreaming of CAREC projects and initiatives in \nnational development agendas. In response to this expectation, at the 10th CAREC Ministerial \nConference, ADB expressed its strong commitment to support the CAREC 2020 strategy by \nproviding financial, technical, and knowledge resources, and to assist in the coordination of the \nprogram. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The proposed TA is expected to contribute to an expansion in the total international \ntrade of CAREC member countries, as envisaged in CAREC 2020\u2019s strategic objective. To \ncontribute to achieving this impact, coordination of the CAREC program will be enhanced as the \nTA\u2019s intended outcome. The vehicle of coordination has been established as the OIF. The TA \nwill continue ADB\u2019s support for the OIF national and regional mechanisms, as well as the overall \ncoordination of the CAREC program.  \n \n                                                \n6  Positive feedback from partners on ADB\u2019s performance has been voiced in numerous ministerial conferences and \nSOMs. For example, see para. 16 of Collective View of the Multilateral Institutions at the Ninth Ministerial \nConference in Cebu, Philippines on 2 November 2010 (http://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/events/2010/9th-\nMC/Collective-View-Multilateral-Institutions.pdf). \n ", "      3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The expected outputs of the TA are: (i) the regional and national bodies under the \nCAREC OIF increase their effectiveness; and (ii) CAREC coordination support is strengthened.  \n \n8.  Effective  CAREC  regional  and  national  bodies.  Over  the  first  10  years  of  the \nprogram,  an  annual  calendar  for  regular  meetings  took  shape  and  is  anticipated  to  be \nmaintained for the coming years. These regular meetings may be supplemented by ad hoc calls \nfor extraordinary meetings as issues arise. Of the regular meetings, the most high profile is the \nannual  Ministerial  Conference,  which  serves  as  a  platform  for  discussing  and  adopting \ngoverning policies and strategies for the CAREC program. The SOM, which convenes at least \ntwice a year with participation from member countries\u2019 NFPs and sector focal points, lays the \nground for the Ministerial Conference by holding in-depth discussions on sector progress, and \nproposing new initiatives under the CAREC strategy. These SOMs are informed and guided by \nfindings and recommendations of the four sector coordinating committee meetings, which meet \non average semiannually, with some variations from sector to sector.7 The TA will fund these \nmeetings  and  others  under  the  OIF,  which  will  play  a  vital  role  in  efficient  and  effective \nimplementation of CAREC 2020. \n \n9.  For the program in general, and the regional and national institutions in particular, to \ngain broader acceptance and support, it has been recognized that an outreach strategy is \nneeded at various levels. At the national level, each member country, led by the office of the \nNFP and supported by the CAREC Unit in ADB, which serves as the program secretariat, has \nbegun formulation of a national outreach strategy. They will regularly convene CAREC national \nconsultation workshops, at their respective locations. These workshops will benefit from a range \nof  stakeholder  participation,  promote  greater  awareness  of  CAREC  2020,  and  nurture  a \nparticipatory approach in the planning and implementation of CAREC projects, all of which will \ncontribute to greater country ownership of CAREC. At the regional level, ADB will help conduct \noutreach activities with a view to mobilizing further support for the program. \n \n10.  Strengthened  CAREC  coordination  support.  The  TA  will  strengthen  support  for \nCAREC  coordination  by  providing  a  team  of  core  coordinating  consultants  based  in  ADB \nHeadquarters, and consultants based in the 10 member countries. The consultants will assist in, \namong  other  things,  the  following:  (i)  supporting  national  coordination  mechanisms  in  the \nmember countries; (ii) planning and organizing CAREC events and meetings; (iii) planning, \npreparing, and monitoring CAREC 2020 projects; (iv) monitoring the development effectiveness \nof the CAREC program for strategic decision making; (v) liaising with other CAREC multilateral \ninstitution partners and stakeholders; (vi) updating the CAREC 2020 rolling medium-term priority \nprojects list; (vii) helping conduct selected small studies as requested by CAREC national and \nregional bodies; and (viii) undertaking effective advocacy and outreach activities. They will also \nhelp  with  information-sharing  activities  with  other  development  partners  and  regional \norganizations  to maximize  opportunities for  regional  cooperation  and  to  avoid  overlap  and \nduplication of efforts. \n \n11.  The consultants, based in the participating countries, act as national advisors to the \nNFPs and regional cooperation coordinators (RCCs). The advisors assist the NFPs with in-\nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                                \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n7  ADB provides technical inputs to the Transport Sector Coordinating Committee, the Energy Sector Coordinating \nCommittee, and the Customs Cooperation Committee (Trade Facilitation Sector). The World Bank provides \ntechnical inputs to the Energy Sector Coordinating Committee, and the IMF to the Trade Policy Coordinating \nCommittee.  \n ", "4   \n \n \ncountry  coordination  among  ministries  and  agencies,  to  monitor  and  promote  timely \nimplementation  of  CAREC  agreements  and  events.  The  advisors  and  the  RCCs  facilitate \ncoordination with the CAREC Unit staff and consultants in ADB Headquarters. Among other \ntasks, the RCCs support preparation of reports and organization of meetings and other events. \nThe advisors and RCCs help ensure that national commitments made during CAREC events \nare followed up and acted upon. Since February 2012, advisors and RCCs have been helping \nkeep track of progress on key CAREC activities in member countries through their monthly \nreports to ADB. These reports also cover developments related to other (non-CAREC) regional \ncooperation initiatives. \n \n12.  With support from the TA, CAREC consultants will continue to improve the presentation \nand  content  of  the  CAREC  program  website  (www.carecprogram.org).  They  will  also  help \norganize events and forums to promote private sector participation in CAREC initiatives.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF), comprising $2,300,000 equivalent from TASF-IV and $700,000 equivalent from TASF-\nother sources. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months during September 2012\u2013August 2015. ADB \nwill be the executing agency, with the CWRD acting as the focal point. \n \n15.  The TA will finance approximately 10 person-months of international and 324 person-\nmonths of national consulting services engaged annually during the implementation period. \nConsultants will be employed by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). International consultants will include experts \nin  sector  and  regional  cooperation,  and  public  relations.  National  consultants  will  include \nnational advisors to the CAREC NFPs, RCCs, sector experts and coordinators, a regional \ncooperation program officer, a regional cooperation program analyst, a web developer and \nadministrator, a website and publications expert, and an administrative assistant. International \nand national resource persons will also be engaged. The consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference \nare in Appendix 4. The consultants will be recruited as individuals, and not through a firm, \nbecause  (i)  they  will  be  operating  in  different  countries;  (ii)  their  work  and  outputs  are \nindependent of each other; and (iii) overall management of the consultants will be performed by \nthe CAREC Unit within the CWRD. \n \n16.  Equipment budgeted for under the TA consists of computers and small office equipment \nthat will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The outputs of the TA will be disseminated at CAREC ministerial conferences, which \nreceive significant media coverage, and through the CAREC program website. Good practices \nand lessons learned will be documented in the progress reports submitted to CAREC senior \nofficials and discussed during the senior officials\u2019 meetings. All such reports will be posted \nregularly on the CAREC program website, and shared with ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Community of Practice. \n \n ", "      5 \nIV.
