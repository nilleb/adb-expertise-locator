INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the efforts of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to scale up its investment in climate change adaptation in Asia and the \nPacific through (i) the development of country-specific climate projections based on the latest \nclimate  model  experiments  for  developing  member  countries  (DMCs);  (ii)  the  provision  of \ntechnical support to integrate climate resilience features into investment project design; and (iii) \nthe development of good practice guidance on climate-resilient project design, and the technical \ncapacity of ADB operational teams and DMC project partners for using climate projections in \nresilient infrastructure design.1    \n \n2.  The TA is included in the approved 2017 annual work program of the Climate Change and \nDisaster Risk Management Thematic Group2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 identifies climate change, including increases in \nthe frequency and intensity of climate-related natural hazards, as a critical emerging development \nchallenge for Asia and the Pacific.3 The midterm review establishes scaled-up support for climate \nchange adaptation as a strategic priority. In 2015, ADB committed to double its annual climate \nfinancing to $6 billion from its own resources by 2020, including an ambitious $2 billion for climate \nchange adaptation. To achieve this target, ADB must scale up its climate change adaptation \nactivities significantly, consistent with the strategic priorities identified in the midterm review. \nExternally, with the Paris Agreement on climate change entering into force, DMCs\u2019 demand for \nADB assistance in delivering nationally determined contributions (including those related to \nclimate change resilience) will increase in the future. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Climate Change Operational Framework, 2017\u20132030, which was approved on 4 \nJuly 2017, defines the broad strategic direction for strengthening ADB\u2019s actions on climate change \nthrough  2030.  Specific  recommendations  for  scaling  up  ADB\u2019s  climate  change  adaptation \nactivities include (i) considering opportunities for investment in climate resilience at the country \npartnership strategy stage, and (ii) initiating climate risk and vulnerability assessments (CRVAs) \nat the concept stage for all projects to ensure that climate change adaptation measures are fully \nintegrated in project designs. \n \n5.  While ADB has made progress since 2007 in establishing internal processes, providing \ntechnical and financial resources, and developing capacities for integrating climate change \nadaptation into operations, there is significant scope for improvement. Some of the most critical \ngaps relate to data, expertise, and guidance on good practice. Credible climate information is \n                                                \n1  The definitions of climate change adaptation and resilience used in this TA are adopted from those used by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. According to the Panel, climate change adaptation refers to \u201cthe \nprocess of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate \nor avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate \nadjustment to expected climate and its effects.\u201d Resilience is defined as \u201cthe capacity of social, economic, and \nenvironmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways \nthat maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, \nlearning, and transformation.\u201d According to this definition, resilience can be understood as the desired outcome of \nclimate  change  adaptation.  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change.  2014.  Annex  II:  Glossary. \nhttp://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-AnnexII_FINAL.pdf.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 18 September 2017. \n3  ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n \n ", "2 \nneeded to design and develop resilient investment programs and projects, and many climate-\nsensitive projects invest significant resources in climate data acquisition and analysis. However, \nthis ad hoc approach is not cost effective, and makes it both challenging to compare project risk \nlevels  across  sectors  and  countries  and  difficult  to  prioritize  climate  change  adaptation \ninvestments. Many of these problems could be avoided if each DMC could access a common \nsource of climate data. Although various agencies have attempted to provide access to climate \nprojections data, these data are either out of date or at scales that are not applicable for the \nanalyses required to inform ADB\u2019s operations in its DMCs.4  \n \n6.  There is also high unmet demand for technical experts to provide tailored, project-level \nsupport and practical guidance on critical climate risks and appropriate adaptation interventions. \nThe demand for project-level support is expected to grow as ADB escalates its efforts to meet \nclimate adaptation financing targets. ADB currently engages specialists to conduct CRVAs, \ntypically at the project preparation stage. However, inputs from experienced sectoral experts are \nrequired from project conception through implementation to ensure that, among other things, (i) \nclimate hazards and project vulnerabilities are characterized properly, (ii) CRVAs are designed \nand implemented to provide specific information and recommendations to identify appropriate \nadaptation options for risk management, (iii) CRVA recommendations are effectively integrated \ninto final project designs, and (iv) monitoring and evaluation frameworks are established and \nimplemented.  \n \n7.  Finally, due both to the non-stationary behavior of important climatic variables (in particular, \nextremes of rainfall, temperature, and wind speed), and to new sources of uncertainty, many \nexisting and long-standing engineering practices can no longer be applied uncritically under a \nchanging  climate.  Further,  model-generated  projections  cannot  simply  be  substituted  for \nobserved  historical  data.  Although  the  engineering  community  has  not  yet  achieved  full \nconsensus regarding how best to modify design practice to accommodate climate change impacts, \nseveral  promising  approaches  have  emerged.  It  is  necessary  to  review  these  emerging \napproaches critically, and to test and develop sector good practice guidance on climate-resilient \nproject  design.  The  current  lack  of  expert  guidance  throughout  the  project  cycle  is  partly \nresponsible for the limited operational uptake of climate-resilient engineering design within ADB. \nThis must change if ADB\u2019s ambitious targets of scaling up climate change adaptation investments \nare to be achieved.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) adaptation and climate resilience in \ndevelopment planning and project design and implementation mainstreamed, and (ii) regional \npublic goods, including effective regional responses to climate change supported.5 The TA will \nhave the following outcome: decision making for climate resilient investments in selected DMCs \nenhanced.6 \n                                                \n4  For example, the United Nations Development Programme developed a set of country climate profiles based on \nclimate model outputs associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme.  Climate  Change  Country  Profiles. \nhttp://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/research/climate/projects/undp-cp/. The World Bank also developed a set of these country \nprofiles.  World  Bank.  Climate  Country  Adaptation  Profiles. \nhttp://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/index.cfm?page=climate_country_adaptation.  \n5  As defined by the TA. \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n  \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n9.  Output 1: Country-specific climate projections to support planning developed. \nCountry-specific  climate  projections  datasets  will  be  developed  for  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  These \nprojections data will be derived from the most up-to-date climate model experiments, including \nthe  Climate  Model  Inter-Comparison  Project  Phase  57 and  simulations  from  the  relevant \ncoordinated regional climate downscaling experiment  domains.8  Climate projections will cover a \nrange of spatial and temporal scales for a selection of key climate variables, and will be available \nin accessible and user-friendly data formats.9 Climate projections will be developed to represent \nas wide a range of uncertainties as possible, including those associated with greenhouse gas \nemissions, climate sensitivity, and feedback mechanisms within the climate system, climate \nmodel specifications as well as downscaling approaches and other sources as appropriate to \nenable risk-based and robust adaptation approaches. Analytical methods and computational \ncodes, once developed for this TA, can be utilized to perform similar analyses to update the \nprojections as outputs from new climate model simulations become available in the future. A \ndetailed technical note describing, among other things, the data sources and analytical methods \nused to develop this output will be produced. \n \n10.  Output 2: Technical support for ADB operations to integrate climate resilience \nfeatures provided. A framework agreement contracting approach will be used to identify and \nempanel a roster of climate adaptation experts with relevant sector expertise who will be available \nto provide both continuous and intermittent (strategic) support to project teams upon request over \nthe investment project cycle. The experts will (i) support the project teams in the preliminary \nscoping and assessment of, among other things, climate risks, project vulnerabilities, and the \ndesign of fit-for-purpose CRVAs, as required; (ii) work with design teams to ensure that required \nclimate resilience interventions are effectively integrated in the project\u2019s final design; and (iii) help \ndesign ongoing risk monitoring and adaptive interventions, including the consideration of the \nsocial aspects of adaptation. The roster of recruited experts shall collectively bring in expertise in \nthe  following  five  target  sectors:  agriculture  and  food  security,  energy,  transport,  urban \ndevelopment, and water resources. Technical advice can encompass target analyses, the review \nof draft technical documents, mission support, and application of good practice guidance.  \n  \n11.  Output 3: Good practice guidance on climate-resilient infrastructure design and \nassociated training modules developed and delivered. The roster of experts will develop a \nset of sector-specific good practice guidance (output 2) to help project teams incorporate climate \nprojections information into project design. These guidelines will be based both on insights gained \nby experts in supporting climate-resilient project development, and on state-of-the-art reviews of \nemerging engineering design and decision-making protocols that reflect the impacts of climate \nchange. Sector guidance will be provided for agriculture and food security, energy, transport, \nurban development, and water. Training modules targeting DMC officials and ADB operational \nstaff involved in the design of resilient infrastructure projects will be developed to facilitate the \nwider dissemination of, and capacity building around, the good practice guidance and enhanced \n                                                \n7  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.0 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB Technical Assistance Special Fund, with $0.54 million from TASF 6 and $0.96 \nmillion from TASF-other sources, and $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate \nChange Fund.10. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. The Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Division \nwill be the implementing agency, and will coordinate with ADB\u2019s regional departments, Private \nSector Operations Department, and relevant resident missions. The division will work closely with \nthe sector and thematic groups to obtain inputs for TA activity planning and feedback on draft TA \noutputs.  \n \n Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2017\u2013December 2019 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  Climate Change Division and Disaster Risk Management Division, SDCC \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nICS (international and  14 person-months  $0.19 million \nnational consultants)  (international)   \n24 person-months  $0.12 million \n(national) \nFA (international  65 person-months  $1.30 million  \nconsultants)    \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FA = framework agreement, ICS = individual consultants selection, SDCC = \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n14.
