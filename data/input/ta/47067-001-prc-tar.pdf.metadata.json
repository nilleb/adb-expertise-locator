The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  asked  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for policy and advisory technical assistance (TA)  to support the \ndevelopment of the Northeast Asia Logistics Information-Sharing Network (NEAL-NET) based \non international best practice. During missions in June and September 2013, ADB and the \ngovernment  reached  an  understanding  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services for \nthe TA.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Northeast Asia, comprising the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, is an important \nregion for the global economy. The aggregate gross domestic product of the three countries is \napproximately  17%  of  the  world  economy,  with  a  total  value  of  approximately  \n$4.5 trillion. Container throughput between the three countries accounts for 30% of the global \ntotal, constituting the biggest transport chain in Asia. Trade volume increased from $130 billion \nin 1999 to $690 billion in 2011. The PRC is now the largest trading partner of Japan and the \nRepublic of Korea. Japan is the fourth largest trading partner of the PRC, and the Republic of \nKorea is the sixth. \n \n3.  Sustaining this trade growth requires continuing attention to competitiveness, including \nhaving a highly efficient and low-cost logistics system. This in turn needs real-time sharing of \nlogistics information among the various logistics participants. Presently the three countries have \nno unified logistics information-sharing mechanism. The limitation in information sharing creates \na bottleneck for logistics and results in higher costs and delays.  \n \n4.  The PRC has a domestic information interchange platform, China National Transport \nLogistics Public Information Platform (LOGINK), initially developed in Zhejiang Province. The \nMinistry of Transport (MOT) is promoting its use as a national information-sharing platform, and \nas a result, enterprises across the PRC are gradually adopting the system. It already has \n100,000 registered users with a daily average of 800,000 information interchanges. Japan and \nthe Republic of Korea also have their own national information-sharing systems. The three \ncountries have therefore conceptualized NEAL-NET, which will establish an information-sharing \nplatform between them and attempt to build upon their respective domestic systems. \n \n5.  NEAL-NET, a mechanism to promote logistics information sharing, was proposed during \nthe Third PRC\u2013Japan\u2013Republic of Korea Ministerial Conference on Transport and Logistics in \nMarch 2010. The countries signed the memorandum of understanding to establish NEAL-NET \nin  December  2010  and  a  secretariat  was  established  in  Hangzhou  in  the  PRC.  The \ndevelopment of NEAL-NET is expected to strengthen regional cooperation. \n \n6.  NEAL-NET is a transnational, nonprofit cooperation mechanism for logistics information \ninterchange, sharing, and technical cooperation. Its objective is to improve overall logistics \ninformation  in  Northeast  Asia  by  providing  an  information  exchange  platform  and  unified \nstandard. Presently the NEAL-NET initiative is focusing on international marine transport with a \nview to sharing information on container vessel status and associated container status. An \ninformation standard for real-time container vessel status is being defined, which should lay the \nfoundation for effective promotion of port logistics information sharing among the three countries. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 September 2013. \n ", "2   \nThe three countries have selected ports where the unified information\u2013sharing standard will be \npiloted: Ningbo\u2013Zhoushan port (the PRC), Tokyo-Yokohama port (Japan), and Busan port (the \nRepublic of Korea). \n \n7.  The  TA  will  assist  the  NEAL-NET  secretariat  in  these  efforts.  Development  of  the \ncommon information standard involves two stages: \n(i)  Stage 1: Finalization of specifications. The governments of the PRC, Japan, \nand the Republic of Korea must reach an agreement on specifications for a \ncommon information-sharing standard.  \n(ii)  Stage 2: Conformity with specifications. The logistics nodes (such as ports) \nmust  reform  their  information  interfaces  in  accordance  with  the  standard. \nPotential users need to modify their systems to access the information-sharing \ninterface. \n \n8.  The  TA  will  assist  in  developing  a  road  map  outlining  how  to  expand  logistics \ninformation-sharing services to include other transport modes. The TA will assist NEAL-NET, \nwhich presently focuses on maritime transport, to explore inclusion of other transport modes \nsuch as land transport, railways, and air transport. The TA will identify challenges that would \nneed to be overcome and outline the expansion of the service coverage area to the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations, the European Union, and other regions.  \n \n9.  The TA is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 and is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, for the PRC, which seeks to improve \ntransport efficiency through intermodal transport and related logistics services development. \nThe  TA  will  support  the  government  in  defining  the  development  strategy  for  logistics \ninformation-sharing services and research international logistics information technology and \nplatforms. The TA is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational \nPlan,2 which emphasizes the need to develop quality logistics information and environmentally \nsustainable and inclusive growth. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be improved logistics services in Northeast Asia. The outcome \nwill be the development of logistics information-sharing services.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  support  the  development  and  adoption  of  a  new  NEAL-NET  logistics \ninformation-sharing standard. The new standard is expected to build upon existing standards \nand be suitable for all three countries to adopt and implement in their maritime ports. The TA will \nassist the three countries in reaching an agreement on this common standard. It will also help \nthe NEAL-NET secretariat prepare a development strategy that includes a road map expanding \nthe international logistics information platform to include other transport modes from maritime \ntransport  to  land,  railway,  and  air  transport.  It  will  recommend  ways  to  enhance \nintergovernmental  cooperation  among  the  NEAL-NET  countries  and  with  other  geographic \nregions, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union. \n \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2010. Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan. Manila. \n ", "  3 \n12.  The  TA  will  assist  in  reviewing  other  information-sharing  standards  such  as  those \ndeveloped by the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business and the \nInternational Standards Organization, and support work to develop a single harmonized NEAL-\nNET standard that can be adopted as the information-sharing standard by ports in NEAL-NET \ncountries. The TA will provide an expert facilitator to help the countries reach an agreement on \nthe common standard. It will review efforts required by the designated pilot ports to adopt the \nagreed common standard, and provide recommendations to help guide other ports seeking to \nadopt the common information-sharing standard. \n \n13.  The TA outputs will be (i) a report and recommendations on the common  logistics \ninformation-sharing standard, and (ii) recommendations on a development strategy for NEAL-\nNET.  \n \n14.  The key activities will involve the following tasks: \n(i)  Review  the  ongoing  work  for  developing  the  common  logistics  information-\nsharing standard, including attending technology group meetings to understand \noutstanding issues and obtain feedback from technical experts attending these \nmeetings. \n(ii)  Survey the major shipping companies, freight forwarders, and others involved in \nthe logistics chain to collect their feedback on the implementation and adoption of \nthe common information-sharing standard. \n(iii)  Recommend measures for developing a unified information-sharing standard and \nfor wide-scale adoption of LOGINK and NEAL-NET by a range of enterprises and \nusers. \n(iv)  Study the existing systems in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and \nEuropean Union countries and recommend a development strategy for NEAL-\nNET, including a road map for expanding the international logistics information \nplatform to include different transport modes such as maritime transport, inland \nwaterways, railways, and air transport. \n(v)  Organize international training (study tour) to exchange ideas with other regions \nand include recommendations to enhance the geographic scope of NEAL-NET. \nThis  will  involve  promoting  further  logistics  cooperation  among  the  three \ncountries and expanding service coverage area to ASEAN, the European Union, \nand other regions. The study tour will also provide an opportunity to engage with \ncountries in the European Union, with a similar initiative called e-Freight Project. \n \n15.  The TA assumes that the PRC, Japan, and the Republic of Korea are willing to develop \na common logistics information-sharing service and will actively collaborate for this purpose. \nThe TA is proposed as a PRC TA as the secretariat of NEAL-NET is based in Hangzhou and \nthe consultants recruited through the TA will work with the secretariat. The TA will mainly \nsupport PRC\u2019s efforts in adopting the common information interchange platform. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of suitably furnished office accommodation with utilities; \ntelecommunications  access;  materials,  maps,  data,  and  documents  required  by  the  TA; \ncounterpart professional and support staff; and other in-kind contributions. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOT  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nsupervision and monitoring of TA activities. The NEAL-NET secretariat at Hangzhou will be the \nimplementing agency and be responsible for guiding TA activities on a day-to-day basis. A \nproject  coordinator  from  the  NEAL-NET  secretariat  will  be  assigned  to  ensure  timely \nimplementation and will supervise and coordinate day-to-day TA activities, including monitoring \nprogress, resolving problems, arranging meetings, and liaising with relevant departments in \nMOT and other concerned agencies. MOT will provide sufficient counterpart staff with relevant \nwork experience during TA implementation.  \n \n18.  The consultants will be based in Hangzhou and their work will directly contribute to the \nworking of the NEAL-NET secretariat. They will attend the technology group meetings in which \nthe three NEAL-NET countries participate. These meetings are conducted regularly to discuss \ntechnical issues related to developing a common information-sharing standard. \n \n19.  The TA will require about 7 person-months of international and about 14 person-months \nof national consulting services. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n20.  ADB will engage a team of national consultants through a consulting firm, on the basis of \nthe quality of the proposal (90%) and the cost of services to be provided (10%), using simplified \ntechnical proposal procedures. The 90:10 weighting is appropriate since the TA is a highly \nspecialized assignment requiring specialized technical expertise in networking technologies and \nlogistics. \n \n21.  ADB  will  engage  international  consultants  as  individuals.  Individual  consultants  are \nneeded,  as  the  TA  is  an  advanced  assignment  requiring  specialized  expertise  in  logistics \ninformation harmonization. This is a relatively new concept, even within developed countries, \nand the required skill sets are unlikely to be readily available through regular consulting firms. \nThe individuals may be hired from academia in order to have a suitable research background to \nmeaningfully contribute to ongoing research efforts. \n \n22.  The government will provide complementary inputs. The office space will be arranged at \nthe NEAL-NET secretariat in Hangzhou. Procurement of TA relevant equipment will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \nOwnership of equipment will be transferred to MOT after TA completion. Disbursement will be \nundertaken  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n23.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  1  December  2013  to  31  December  2015.  The \nconsultants will submit inception, interim, draft final, and other reports in English and Chinese. \nThe  structure  of  these  reports  and  timing  of  submission  is  outlined  in  Appendix  3.  The \nconsultants will hold regular workshops to present findings and recommendations, and solicit \nfeedback from key stakeholders. The consultants will attend the NEAL-NET technical group \nmeetings  and  other  coordination  events,  and  report  on  the  discussions  and  agreements \nreached. Other relevant ministries and agencies will be closely consulted and involved during \nTA implementation and the review of the TA outputs. They will be invited to participate in the \nreview workshops and discussions pertaining to the TA.  \n \n ", "  5 \n24.  ADB missions will monitor the progress and performance of the TA. The ADB project \nteam  is  expected  to  prepare  and  disseminate  working  papers  describing  key  findings, \nrecommendations, and lessons from TA implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Formulation of the Northeast Asia \nLogistics Information-Sharing Network Development Program and Organizational Mechanism, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved logistics  By 2020:  Logistics performance  The NEAL-NET \nservices in Northeast  The PRC\u2019s logistics  index maintained by the  countries continue to \nAsia  performance index  World Bank  implement the road \n  country ranking is  map developed \nimproved by at least five  through the TA \nplaces (baseline: 26 in   \n2012)   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nDevelopment of logistics  By 2015:   TA progress or  The NEAL-NET \ninformation-sharing  The information standard  performance report  countries maintain \nservices  and road map  TA main report  political will and \n  recommendation is  commitment to \nTA completion report \naccepted by NEAL-NET  improve logistics \ncountries   Government feedback  information services.  \n  and actions following  MOT has strong \nTA implementation \nproject implementation \n   \ncapability and sufficient \n    counterpart funds to \nensure smooth \nimplementation of the \nproject. \nMOT supports key TA \nrecommendations. \nRisk \nThe three countries are \nunable to reach \nagreement on a \ncommon information-\nsharing standard. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
