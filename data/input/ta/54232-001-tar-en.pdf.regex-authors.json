INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will facilitate the development of a \ncomprehensive scoping study and a framework to support economic corridor development (ECD) \nin Armenia and Georgia to enhance trade and competitiveness in the two countries and make \ntheir economies more diversified, inclusive, and resilient. Empirical evidence from other countries \nsuggests that economic corridor development in Armenia and Georgia (ECD\u2013AG) can boost trade \nand strengthen regional cooperation and integration (RCI) among Armenia, Georgia, and their \nneighboring countries for higher and more resilient growth.1 ECD\u2013AG can be developed by \nmaximizing the potential of existing road corridors, including the East\u2013West Highway2 in Georgia, \nthe North\u2013South Corridor in Armenia,3 and the Armenia\u2013Georgia Border Regional Road,4 which \nare partly financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Accordingly, the TA will enhance the \neconomic  benefits  of  these  physical  infrastructures  by  transforming  them  into  economic \ncorridors.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The expansion of ECD caused by rapid increases in global production networks and value \nchains will boost investment, production, and trade. ECD has the key features of spatial economic \ndevelopment\u2014economies of scale, agglomeration, diversification, and specialization through \ninfrastructure, and industrial and urban developments. In addition to requiring quality hard and \nsoft infrastructures and trade facilitation, ECD also needs a strong political commitment and the \nright policy incentives. \n \n3.  ADB has supported ECD in many parts of  Asia, such as the Greater Mekong Subregion, \nand in Central and West Asia, such as the Almaty\u2013Bishkek Economic Corridor,6 the Pakistan \nEconomic Corridors Programme,7 and ECD among Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.8 \nGeorgia is a member of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program\u2014\nwhich supports the development of road corridors and facilitates regional trade and transport\u2014\nwhile Armenia is a strategic partner in ECD. The proposed TA builds on the ADB-supported \nprojects related to ECD by targeting the West Caucasus region involving Armenia and Georgia, \nmaking ADB\u2019s coverage of ECD work more comprehensive. \n \n4.  The TA will contribute to ADB\u2019s key knowledge products to support its operations in \nArmenia and Georgia as described in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Armenia, 2019\u2013\n20239 (which aims to ensure diversified growth and more inclusiveness); and in ADB\u2019s country \n \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

The TA is also included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Armenia, \n2019\u20132021.11  \n \n5.  The TA\u2019s implementation will build upon completed and ongoing work under a number of \nADB\u2019s TA projects in Armenia and the region such as: Analysis of Economic Opportunities \nAssociated with Armenia\u2019s New Trade Regime, which examines the impact of the new trade \nregime  on  trade  patterns;12 Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy,  which  supports  the \npreparation and initial implementation of Armenia\u2019s Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy \n2020\u20132040;13 Export- and Innovation-Led Industrial Development14 and Partnership with the \nPrivate Sector for Sustainable Trade Facilitation Results in the CAREC Program,15 both of which \naim to improve industrial development and strengthen partnerships between the private and \npublic sectors. The Armenia\u2019s Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy also supports regional \nintegration of road networks and trade facilitation. The TA aligns well with ADB\u2019s Strategy 203016 \n(i.e.  operational  priority  1  on  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  and \noperational priority 7 on fostering RCI), and the Operational Plan for RCI, 2016\u20132020.17 \n \n6.  Armenia and Georgia are part of the Western Caucasus region located at the meeting \npoint of the large economies of Turkey, Iran, and the Russian Federation. The region is also \nsituated along the so-called new Silk Road that connects the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nother parts of Asia with Europe, making RCI in the Western Caucasus essential to further regional \nand global connectivity across Asian and European regions.  \n \n7.  Armenia is a landlocked country with a population of 2.9 million. Two of its four borders \nare closed and one of its neighbors has been subjected to sanctions and geopolitical tensions.18 \nMore than one-quarter of the population lives below the national poverty line. Armenia became \nan upper middle-income country in 2018, but  its narrow economic base makes  its growth \nvulnerable  to  market  swings.  Armenia\u2019s  national  program  for  2019\u20132023  supports  the \ndevelopment of an export-oriented and inclusive economy, including with a focus on enhancing \nconnectivity and trade with neighboring countries, including those belonging to the Eurasian \nEconomic Union.19 In addition, Armenia enhanced trade and economic cooperation with the \nEuropean Union (EU) by signing the EU\u2013Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership \nAgreement in November 2017. Moreover, the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to promote \nArmenia\u2019s position further, strengthening the case for ECD involving Armenia.  \n \n10  ADB. 2019.

Georgia\u2019s  development  strategy  of  Freedom,  Rapid  Development,  Prosperity: \nGovernment Platform 2016\u2013202020 calls for closer integration with the rest of the world. The \ncountry\u2019s population is about 3.5 million, and it had a poverty rate of 20.1% in 2018 and an \nunemployment rate of 14.4% in 2019. Underemployment is also significant in rural areas, calling \nfor more inclusive development and growth. In 2014, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade \nArea between Georgia and the EU came into effect, harmonizing regulatory frameworks, systems, \nand  product  standards.  Georgia\u2019s  Free  Trade  Agreement  with  the  European  Free  Trade \nAssociation became effective in 2017 to facilitate more trade. The need to accelerate growth calls \nfor a better alignment of national and provincial policies. The proposed ECD\u2013AG can expand \neconomic activities and exports, as well as make the development process more inclusive. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: integrated economic development through \nhigher and more diversified growth in line with the aspirations of the governments of Armenia and \nGeorgia.21 The TA will have the following outcome: stronger analytical base for developing \neconomic corridors resulting in greater economic cooperation and integration between Armenia, \nGeorgia, and other countries in the region.22  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Scoping study on potential industries and planning for industry sector \nprioritization in line with ECD\u2013AG conducted. The scoping study will be conducted for Armenia \nand Georgia by: (i) mapping the existing industries, including agriculture and tourism, considering \ntheir challenges and way forward given the countries\u2019 aspirations and the regional and global \ncontexts; and (ii) developing industry sector prioritization plans by assessing the potential demand, \nsupply and export of the potential prioritized industries, while considering their comparative and \ncompetitive advantages, ease of diversification, and trade expansion opportunity. The results \nwould contribute to the countries\u2019 industrial strategies and action plans in the short, medium, and \nlong  terms,  which  will  help  ADB  and  other  development  partners  define  their  strategic \nengagement with the two countries. \n \n11.  Output 2: ECD\u2013AG framework prepared. ECD is expensive and must be conducted \nsystematically and comprehensively based on an ECD framework developed by learning from \nglobal best practices and considering the local context. It also requires a strong commitment, \nsupportive institutions, and conducive regulations that encourage entrepreneurship and private \nsector development. The proposed ECD\u2013AG framework will cover planning, management, and \noperations in line with the governments\u2019 intention to use ECD as a development tool to achieve \nhigher and more broad-based growth, and to identify potential future project pipelines for support \nby ADB and other development partners.  \n \n \n20  Government of Georgia. 2016.

Output  3:  Trade  competitiveness  improvement  framework  developed.  Trade \ncompetitiveness is a key driver for higher growth and more diversified and resilient economy.23 \nThis framework will complement the ECD\u2013AG framework by providing guidelines to improve \ncompetitiveness.  The  framework  will  identify  the  key  challenges  hampering  the  countries\u2019 \ndomestic  and  international  competitiveness  and  suggest  the  way  forward  by  considering \ninfrastructure,  institutions  and  regulations,  the  macroeconomic  environment,  education  and \ntraining, market efficiency, financial intermediaries, technological readiness, and innovation. \nThese competitiveness aspects can be derived from the World Bank\u2019s global competitiveness \nframework.24 \n \n13.  Output 4: Strategic Policy Note on ECD-AG prepared. The Strategic Policy Note will \nbe developed based on TA outputs of the scoping study on potential industries and planning for \nindustry  sector  prioritization  in  line  with  ECD\u2013AG, the  ECD\u2013AG framework,  and  the trade \ncompetitiveness  improvement  framework  to  help  leaders,  policy  makers  and  other  key \nstakeholders in Armenia and Georgia appreciate the ECD-AG work and put its findings and \nrecommendations in practice to support sustained and diversified growth in the region. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n  \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Fund.25 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. The governments of Armenia and Georgia will provide counterpart support in the form of staff \ntime, office space and supplies, study materials, data, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA and the Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision (CWRC) of the Central and West Asia Department will implement it in close coordination \nwith ADB\u2019s resident missions in Armenia and Georgia, and other operations and knowledge \ndepartments.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from November 2020 to October 2022. ADB \nwill engage about 10 person-months of international and 40 person-months of national individual \nconsultants. The implementation will be flexible so that the terms of reference, duration, and \nschedule of TA inputs will be adjusted to meet the capacity building needs and ensure that TA \nfunds are utilized effectively. The international individual consultants will include (i) ECD related \nexperts to provide technical advice, analytical support, and policy recommendations, and (ii) a \ntrade  expert  to  analyze  trade  links  between  Armenia  and  Georgia  and  provide  policy \nrecommendations  for  increased  trade  integration  through  ECD.  The  national  individual \nconsultants, who will be based in Armenia, Georgia, and the Philippines, will include (i) research \nassistants to  provide  technical  support  and  inputs to  the  international  consultants  and  the \nspecialists within CWRC; (ii) a project coordinator to provide operations and administrative \nsupport  to the  international  consultants  and  CWRC;  and  (iii)  a  copy editor to support the \npublications. ADB will also engage international and national resource persons to provide inputs, \nreview reports, and participate as presenters, facilitators, and/or discussants in meetings and \nworkshops.26  \n \n23  In  2019,  ADB  approved  a  cooperation  agreement  memo  with  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and \nDevelopment related to ECD. \n24  World Bank.
