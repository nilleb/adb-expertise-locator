The transaction technical assistance (TA) will prepare the proposed Climate and Disaster \nResilient Small-Scale Water Resources Management Project. The project will improve agricultural \nproductivity and profitability through effective, participatory, and sustainable small-scale water \nresources management within the selected geographic areas.1 The project will support the small-\nscale  water  resources  subsector  by  (i)  drawing  lessons  from  previous  investments,  (ii) \nincorporating climate and disaster resilience features in infrastructure and facilities, (iii) promoting \nclimate and disaster tolerant crops and cropping practices, and (iv) introducing agricultural value \nchains.2 \n2.  Subject to confirmation during the feasibility study, the project will provide investment \nsupport for approximately 150 new subprojects and 400 enhancement subprojects, and the \nfollowing outputs and interventions.3 \n3.  Output 1: participatory subproject development improved will (i) create 150 new water \nmanagement cooperative associations (WMCAs); (ii) support their skills development for efficient \nuse of water management infrastructure, including climate and disaster resilience aspects, and \ngender  and  social  inclusion;  (iii)  support  WMCAs\u2019  income-generating  activities  other  than \nagriculture by promoting training and capacity development for civil works monitoring, preparing \noperation and maintenance manuals, undertaking minor routine maintenance of infrastructure, \nand effectively using WMCA operation and maintenance funds.  \n4.  Output 2: small-scale water resources infrastructure with climate and disaster resilient \nfeatures developed or enhanced will (i) develop 150 new subprojects with climate and disaster \nresilient features; and (ii) enhance about 400 (out of 845) existing WMCAs\u2019 infrastructure with \nclimate and disaster resilient features to improve the system functionality by maximizing benefits \nthrough adaptive low-cost investments. Interventions with overall emphasis on climate proofing \nand climate-smart investment and promoting adaptation and disaster resilience will focus on \n(i) flood and drought management; (ii) drainage improvement; and (iii) existing irrigation systems \nimprovement. \n5.  Output 3: Upazila- and WMCA-level value chain enhanced will (i) increase the income of \nWMCAs by developing market-driven agricultural  production; and (ii) build and operationalize \npost-harvest  management  infrastructure  such  as  processing  and  storage  facilities,  packing \nhouses, and cold chains at Upazila- and WMCA-levels.  \n6.  These outputs will result in the following outcome: climate resilient agricultural productivity \nand profitability in selected geographic areas increased. The project is aligned with the following \nimpact: food security and rural livelihoods resilience to climate change-induced disasters amongst \n                                                \n1  \u201cSmall-scale\u201d in the context of the project is less than 1,000 hectares of net beneficiary area. The project is proposed \nfor implementation in four broad areas prone to climate and natural hazards risks: (i) the Barind and drought prone \nareas; (ii) the coastal zone; (iii) the Haor and flash flood areas; and (iv) the river systems and estuaries. \n2  From 1996 to 2002, the Local Government Engineering Department in the Local Government Division of the Ministry \nof Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives implemented the first Small-Scale Water Resources \nDevelopment Sector Project financed by ADB, the Netherlands, and the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment (IFAD) which developed 280 subprojects. From 2002 to 2010, the second Small-Scale Water \nResources Development Sector Project, financed by ADB, and the Netherlands, developed an additional 300 \nsubprojects. The third phase, Participatory Small-Scale Water Resources Sector Project financed by ADB, the \nNetherlands, and IFAD, from 2010 to 2017, developed 265 new subprojects, enhanced performance of 148 existing \nones, and introduced important elements of sustainability and poverty reduction through stakeholder-driven water \nresources management systems with special attention to the poorer population.  \n3  Enhancement subprojects will be selected among the 845 existing subprojects. \n ", "2   \nproject beneficiaries increased.4 The country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2020\u2013\n2022 includes an investment loan amounting to $100 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary \ncapital resources for Board consideration in 2020.5 \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n7.  The proposed TA is required to assist the government in preparing the project concept to \nfeasibility level and meet project readiness criteria. The TA will be developed through the following \napproach: (i) sector issues, constraints, and development potentials will be assessed; (ii) a list of \npotential new subprojects will be drawn; (iii) feasibility studies and associated due diligence will \nbe prepared for 30 subprojects representative of the diversities of the project area ; (iv) feasibility \nproposals will be validated through participatory field visits for 100 enhancement subprojects to \nimprove operating performance, agricultural production and productivity, resilience to climate \nchange and disaster, and add value chain to farm produce. The objectives of the TA are to prepare \n(i) the project feasibility study report, including procedures to identify subprojects; and (ii) the draft \nloan processing documents for ADB Board consideration, including the gender related and \nsafeguard documents in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement, 2009. The TA will \nalso provide advance action support to the executing agency to enhance project readiness, such \nas advance procurement of civil work packages and recruitment of consultants. \nB.
