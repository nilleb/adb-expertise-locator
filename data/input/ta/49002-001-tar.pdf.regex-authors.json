INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the development of Timor-\nLeste\u2019s capacity for regional economic integration since 2013. Assistance has been provided \nthrough a 3-year capacity development technical assistance (TA) project financed by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction.1 Responsibility for project administration was transferred to ADB\u2019s \nTimor-Leste Resident Mission in November 2014. The project is scheduled for completion in \nearly 2016. It has made good progress in building capacity for regional integration and has \nsupported important analytical work.   \n \n2.  The  government  appreciates  the  initial  TA  and  has  requested  ADB  to  continue  to \nsupport  its  preparations  for  regional  economic  integration,  with  a  focus  on  achieving  full \nmembership  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN).  A  new  capacity \ndevelopment TA project was included in the nonlending pipeline of the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2015\u20132017.2 The TA will enable a smooth continuation of ADB support following \ncompletion of the current project.  \n \n3.  TLRM  staff  meet  regularly  with  government  officials  responsible  for  Timor-Leste\u2019s \nregional cooperation and integration to discuss implementation of the current TA project and \nfuture TA needs. A fact-finding mission was fielded from 24 October to 9 November 2015 to \nconfirm the objectives and design of the new TA. The government has confirmed the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference presented in this report.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Regional cooperation and integration is an important part of Timor-Leste\u2019s strategy to \ngrow the non-oil economy. The petroleum sector has accounted for up to 84% of total gross \ndomestic product, but production from current fields is declining and the prospects for new \ndevelopments are uncertain. Government spending underpins the non-oil economy. The private \nsector is nascent and is constrained by limited human capital, poor quality infrastructure, and \ngaps in the basic legal framework for commerce. The government is working to address these \nconstraints and is targeting regional integration as a means of promoting trade, investment, and \nlabor market linkages that will support economic diversification.  \n \n5.  ASEAN  membership  is  Timor-Leste\u2019s  principal  regional  cooperation  and  integration \nobjective. Timor-Leste formally applied for membership in 2011, and aims to become a full and \nactive member. It also participates in Pacific regional fora, is pursuing subregional integration \nwith  Australia  and  Indonesia,  and  is  considering  an  application  to  join  the  World  Trade \nOrganization. These regional cooperation and integration initiatives may have synergies if they \nare appropriately coordinated and sequenced.  \n \n6.  The  ASEAN  Charter  establishes  four  conditions  for  membership:  (i)  location  within \nSoutheast Asia, (ii) recognition by all ASEAN member states, (iii) agreement to be bound and to \nabide by the ASEAN Charter, and (iv) ability and willingness to carry out the obligations of \nmembership. Meeting the fourth condition will be challenging for Timor-Leste. ASEAN\u2019s move \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Country Operations Business Plan: Timor-Leste, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n ", "2                  \n \ntoward deeper cooperation and integration means that accession is more technically demanding \nnow than when Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam \njoined in the 1990s. \n \n7.  A new ASEAN member would be required to accede to at least 64 substantive legal \ntreaties, and make the necessary changes to domestic legislation to ensure consistency. A new \nmember must also show commitment to ASEAN policy objectives not captured in these treaties, \nand develop the capacity to participate meaningfully in ASEAN\u2019s technical working meetings. \nEffective and regular participation in relevant working meetings is directly tied with Timor-Leste\u2019s \nability to carry out the obligations of ASEAN membership.3 \n \n8.  The Government of Timor-Leste is preparing for ASEAN accession. It has strengthened \nits diplomatic and economic relations with ASEAN member countries, established a system of \nfocal points in relevant line ministries, and carried out public awareness programs. ADB has \nprovided TA to support capacity building, analysis of the economic implications of ASEAN \naccession, and comprehensive analysis of Timor-Leste\u2019s current laws and policies and the \nreforms needed to meet current ASEAN requirements.   \n \n9.  The Government of Timor-Leste has requested additional TA to support the preparations \nfor ASEAN accession. The key issues to be addressed in the next phase of assistance are \n(i) limited technical understanding of the requirements and implications of ASEAN accession \nand other regional integration initiatives, (ii) limited capacity to plan and implement required \nreforms and participate in regional integration, and (iii) gaps in the systems for coordination and \ncommunications to support ASEAN accession. Addressing these issues would support the \nbroader objective of improving the business environment and growing the non-oil economy.4 \nTimor-Leste is well positioned to achieve its goal of ASEAN membership, but the benefits of the \nTA are not conditional on this.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be Timor-Leste becoming a full member of ASEAN. The outcome will be \nan improvement in Timor-Leste\u2019s ability to meet ASEAN\u2019s requirements and be a full and active \nASEAN member. This encompasses changes to Timor-Leste\u2019s legal and regulatory frameworks, \nthe  development  of  individual  and  institutional  capacities,  and  the  coordination  of \ncomplementary initiatives across a wide range of government and nongovernment institutions.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA  outcome  will  be  achieved  through the  delivery  of four  interrelated  outputs: \n(i) enhanced  understanding  of  the  requirements  and  implications  of  ASEAN  membership, \n(ii) successful implementation of legal and regulatory reforms to meet ASEAN requirements, \n(iii) improved  individual  and  institutional  capacity  to  meet  ASEAN  requirements,  and \n(iv) effective communications with domestic and international stakeholders during the accession \nprocess.  \n                                                \n3  In the event that ASEAN sets out a gradual path to full membership, the frequency and quality of participation in \nmeetings may be linked, formally or informally, to successful progression. \n4  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011. Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030. Dili. \n ", "     33 \n \n \n12.  Output 1. Basic understanding about ASEAN has improved, but many key government \nstakeholders lack the detailed understanding needed to (i) design appropriate reform programs, \n(ii) identify priorities in the event that Timor-Leste can negotiate the terms of its accession, and \n(iii) plan and implement supporting reforms to maximize the benefits of ASEAN accession. The \nTA will address these gaps through the following key activities: \n(i)  detailed analysis of the alignment of Timor-Leste\u2019s current legal and regulatory \nframeworks with the requirements under the ASEAN Community Blueprints and \nASEAN legal instruments;  \n(ii)  training  and  awareness-raising  programs  for  government  officials, \nnongovernment organizations and civil society, the private sector, and the public, \nto build familiarity with ASEAN and the requirements and implications of Timor-\nLeste\u2019s accession;  \n(iii)  provision  of  technical  training  and  capacity  building  to  selected  government \nministries  and  agencies  to  support  improved  understanding  of  ASEAN \nrequirements that fall within their mandates, and the implications of required \nreforms; and \n(iv)  analysis of conditioning reforms that are not compulsory for ASEAN accession \nbut can help to leverage the benefits of accession.  \n \n13.  Output  2.  The  achievement  of  full  ASEAN  membership  will  require  successful \nimplementation of legal and regulatory reforms to meet ASEAN requirements. Previous TA from \nADB and the Japan International Cooperation Agency has supported the mapping of relevant \nlaws  and  regulatory  arrangements,  and  high-level  analysis  of  reform  requirements.5 This \nanalysis will be used to develop a time-bound program of legal and regulatory reforms to \nachieve full compliance with ASEAN requirements. The TA will also support the design and \nimplementation of a scalable pilot activity to accelerate integration with ASEAN members.6 This \ncould be implemented by identifying gaps and constraints on trade between Timor-Leste and \nASEAN members, building institutional capacity to address key constraints, and identifying \npossible investment opportunities to address gaps. Other potential pilot activities will also be \nconsidered. Key activities under output 2 will include the following:  \n(i)  finalization of an overall time-bound reform program and the development of \nwork plans for subcomponents;  \n(ii)  mapping of external sources of technical and financial assistance to support \nimplementation of the reform program;  \n(iii)  design and implementation of a scalable pilot activity to accelerate Timor-Leste\u2019s \nASEAN readiness;  \n(iv)  support  for  the  establishment  and  operation  of  coordination  mechanisms  for \nreforms that involve multiple government and nongovernment stakeholders, such \nas the establishment of a National Committee on Trade Facilitation;   \n(v)  support to the Directorate for ASEAN Affairs to coordinate the reform program, \nmonitor implementation progress, and prepare regular implementation reports; \nand \n(vi)  technical inputs to support selected legal and policy reforms where the support \navailable from other sources is insufficient.  \n                                                \n5   See footnote 1 \n6  A national single window provides a single entry point through which traders can submit all the necessary \ndocumentation and data required for the import or export of goods, and a single decision-making point for customs \nrelease  and  clearance.  The  ASEAN  Single  Window  is  a  platform  to  achieve  integration  and  technical \ninteroperability of the national single windows of ASEAN member countries.  \n ", "4                  \n \n \n14.  Output  3.  The  TA  will  build  individual  and  institutional  capacity  to  meet  ASEAN \nrequirements. Substantial human resources will be needed for Timor-Leste to meet its goal of \nbeing an active and valued ASEAN member. The TA will help the government and its agencies \nto understand their capacity requirements and design and implement programs to meet these \nrequirements. Key activities under this output will include the following:  \n(i)  needs assessment and the development of an overall framework for training and \ncapacity development;  \n(ii)  mapping of resources available to support capacity development and training;  \n(iii)  support for strengthening of the ASEAN focal point system, including capacity \nassessments of the focal points, and targeted training to address knowledge and \nskill gaps;  \n(iv)  support  for  increased  participation  of  government  officials  as  observers  at \nASEAN  meetings,  including  mapping  and  prioritization  of  opportunities  for \nincreased  participation,  and  training  and  mentoring  support  for  participating \nofficials;  \n(v)  support to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and its Directorate of \nASEAN  Affairs  to  coordinate  internal  and  externally  supported  capacity \ndevelopment and training programs; and  \n(vi)  direct provision of training and capacity development to address areas where the \nsupport available from other sources is insufficient. \n \n15.   Output 4. Effective communications with domestic and international stakeholders are a \nkey enabler of ASEAN accession. They will underpin the implementation and coordination of \nlegal and regulatory reform, and ensure effective collection and dissemination of information to \ndomestic  and  international  stakeholders.  The  TA  will  support  effective  communications  by \ncompleting the following key activities:  \n(i)  review of the communications strategy to support ASEAN accession;  \n(ii)  maintenance  of  a  map  of  stakeholders  in  Timor-Leste\u2019s  ASEAN  accession \nprocess;   \n(iii)  support  for  regular  consultation  and  communication  with  nongovernment \norganizations and civil society, the private sector, and the public; and \n(iv)  support  for  communications  with  international  stakeholders  in  Timor-Leste\u2019s \naccession  including  ASEAN  members,  the  ASEAN  Secretariat,  and  other \npartners.  \n \n16.  The methodology and activities assume that current ASEAN member states are willing \nto  accept  Timor-Leste  as  a  member  and  that  the  Government  of  Timor-Leste  will  remain \ncommitted to membership. Successful implementation of TA activities and the transformation of \nactivities into outputs, outcomes, and impacts would all be threatened by the failure of these two \nassumptions. However, both these risks are assessed as having very low probability.  \n \n17.  Other risks include delays in the planning and implementation of TA outputs resulting \nfrom  capacity  constraints,  competing  commitments,  and  insufficient  ownership  of  planned \nreforms. These risks will be managed by adopting a consultative and participatory process \nduring TA inception; integrating the planning and implementation of TA outputs into broader \nnational frameworks for policy formation, legal reform, and capacity development; emphasizing \nrealistic  planning;  and  incorporating  measurable  progress  indicators  into  the  plans  for  TA \nimplementation.  \n \n ", "     55 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA amount is estimated at $1,000,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund7 and $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and accommodation, office \nsupplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, and will be responsible for all recruitment \nof consultants and procurement. This will be done in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and Cooperation, which is mandated to coordinate Timor-Leste\u2019s preparation for ASEAN \nmembership. The ministry will be the implementing agency, with support from consultants, and \nwill coordinate TA-supported activities with other line ministries and government agencies. The \ndirector general for ASEAN affairs will provide overall guidance and supervision of TA activities. \nIn the absence of a director general, the responsibility for guidance and oversight will be given \nto the national director for the ASEAN economic community.    \n \n20.  All TA consultants will be recruited as individuals because of the specialized nature of \nthe tasks. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The total consulting services will include \n54 person-months of international consultants and 48 person-months of national consultants \ncomprising (i) international team leader (24 person-months), (ii) national deputy team leader \n(24 person-months), (iii) national communications and liaison officer (24 person-months), (iv) \ninternational senior legal adviser (12 person-months), and (v) international technical specialists \n(18 person-months). All TA consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be carried \nout  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Technical specialists will be \nengaged as resource persons to support workshops, knowledge sharing, and training events. \nThis modality will not be used to finance ADB staff participation in TA activities.  \n \n21.  TA implementation will draw on ADB\u2019s expertise in regional cooperation and integration. \nA panel of ADB regional cooperation and integration specialists will be formed to provide peer \nreview and guidance during TA implementation and to foster linkages between TA activities and \nADB\u2019s other programs to support regional integration. Progress in delivering TA outputs will be \nmonitored by ADB specialists during TA implementation, and outputs and outcomes will be \nevaluated upon TA completion.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION   \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund, and (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the \nGovernment of Timor-Leste for Capacity for Regional Economic Integration, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.  \n                                                \n7 Established by ADB.
