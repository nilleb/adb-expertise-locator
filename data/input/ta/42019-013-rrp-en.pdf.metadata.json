THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Mountain Railway Safety Enhancement Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will improve railway safety by installing advanced railway signaling \nequipment, communication, power supply, and tunnel monitoring systems on the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi \nsection  of  the  Chengdu\u2013Kunming  railway  line  in  southwestern  PRC.  It  will  also  enhance \ninstitutional capacity to manage railway safety.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Railway development in the PRC. The railway sector is vital to the PRC\u2019s economic and \nsocial development, international trade, continued economic growth, and ability to extend the \nbenefits of development to people living in the more remote regions of the country. The PRC is a \nvast country where people and goods move over long distances, and railways provide the most \neconomic means of transport. Railways have the competitive advantage in moving passengers, \nbulk goods, and containers over medium to long distances. The government has therefore \nprioritized the expansion and modernization of the railway network. During 2003\u20132015, the \nrailway network expanded by 65%, from 73,000 kilometers (km) to 121,000 km. The PRC has \nalso  developed  the  world's  longest  high-speed  railway  network  (19,000  km).  However, \nimprovements have mainly occurred in eastern PRC and the network remains rather sparse and \nbasic in western and southwestern PRC. \n \n4.  Railway development in southwestern PRC. Despite the PRC\u2019s vast expertise in \ndeveloping  the  high-speed  rail  network,  constructing  medium-speed  rail  lines  in  a  highly \nmountainous region such as southwestern PRC poses considerable problems. The difficult and \ndangerous terrain in southwestern PRC is one of the main reasons why the rail network in the \nregion remains inadequate. This region has also lagged in economic development and gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita remains quite low compared to the more prosperous eastern \nprovinces (e.g. provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan are ranked 23 and 30 respectively out of \n31 administrative divisions in the PRC). The limited capacity for freight movements and the long \ntravel times of passenger trains are considered major obstacles to economic development and \npoverty reduction in the region. Hence, the PRC is prioritizing the development of the railway \ninfrastructure in this region to increase speeds and more than double the freight-carrying capacity \nthrough its Western Development Strategy. However, the PRC needs assistance and expertise \nin ensuring that the railway lines are well designed, properly constructed, and conform to the \nhighest standards of safety. \n \n5.  Railway safety. Safety is an integral part of providing competitive, high-quality, and \nreliable transportation for people and goods. As the PRC railway sector expands, introducing new \nconcepts and technologies and increasing speeds, the safety needs are changing as well. The \nPRC recognizes this important aspect and seeks to promote modern rail safety technologies and \nemergency  management  systems  consistent  with  the  development  needs  of  the  country\u2019s \nrailways. It seeks to attract foreign technology and expertise to meet these needs, an area where \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) can play a significant role. \n                                                \n1  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Railway Safety Enhancement Project. ", "2 \n6.  The safety issue is a challenge because the trains encounter difficult operating conditions \namid varying geological features as they crisscross the length and breadth of the country. This is \nparticularly so in southwestern PRC, where the terrain is mountainous and railway lines should \nbe built with many bridges and tunnels. Operating a railway through several tunnels poses \nsignificant challenges for railway safety. Special arrangements need to be made for signaling to \nensure speed restrictions, real-time monitoring of tunnel conditions, and proper lighting, and \nemergency systems for firefighting, ventilation, and rescue need to be installed. Various new \ntechnologies now exist for improving the safety of rail tunnels, and can play a vital role in \npreventing accidents as well as enabling a swift emergency response. \n \n7.  Southwestern PRC has two major fault lines (Anning River Fault Line and Daliang \nMountain Fault Line), so railway construction in the region requires high-intensity earthquake \nfortification. Mountainous areas are also prone to landslides, which cause rocks and debris to \nblock the track and make train operations unsafe. A stronger safety management system, which \nincludes advanced signaling and communication arrangements and more effective management \ninformation, is needed to prevent train accidents and to respond promptly if they do occur. \n \n8.  Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line. The Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line is a key part of a \nregional corridor that will eventually extend to the countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion, \nand thus become a part of an international railway route connecting the subregion to western \nPRC, Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation countries, and the Eurasian land bridge. \n \n9.  The existing line between Chengdu and Kunming was built between 1958 and 1970. It is \na single-track line with operating speeds in the range of 40 km\u201360 km per hour. It has been \noperating  at  near  full  capacity  for  more  than  10  years.  To  expand  capacity  across  the \nsouthwestern region of the PRC, the China Railway Corporation (CRC) is constructing a railway \nline from Chengdu to Kunming with 18 stations. This will involve construction of 860 km of double-\ntrack electrified main railway line for passenger and freight transport operations. The proposed \nalignment of the new Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line is shorter by 236 km (21.5%) compared with \nthe existing single-track line (1,096 km) and has better geometry. The development of the line is \nbeing done in several phases: Guangtong\u2013Kunming (2016), Miyi\u2013Guangtong (2017), Chengdu\u2013\nE\u2019Mei (2018), and E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi (2022). \n \n10.  The capacity along the entire route from Chengdu to Kunming will be greatly increased. \nTrain speeds on the new railway line will increase to 160 km per hour from the existing 60 km per \nhour. The tonnage could increase from 3,200 tons to 4,000 tons net per freight train, and the \ncapacity for passenger train pairs per day could increase from 12 to 35. The shorter alignment \nand faster train speeds will shorten the travel time to less than 8 hours for passenger trains. \nPresently, it takes 18\u201322 hours for people to travel from Chengdu to Kunming via rail. \n \n11.  The region is also one of the most scenic areas in the PRC, so better rail services along \nthis route will support tourism. Sites such as Qionghai Lake in Xichang, hot springs and karst \ncaves in Panzhihua, and Mount E\u2019Mei will become much more accessible to tourists, and more \nvisitors will also contribute to the overall economic development of southwestern PRC. \n \n12.  E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi section. ADB financing will support the provision of safety equipment for the \nE\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi section (386 km) of the Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line, which is the most difficult \nsection of the railway.2 It runs mostly through treacherous terrain traversing mountains and steep \n                                                \n2  This section is currently under construction, and roughly 19% of the works are completed (30 June 2017). \n \n ", "3 \nriver valleys and requiring 141 bridges (80.8 km) and 52 tunnels (211.4 km), 7 of which will be \nlonger than 10 km each, and climbing 1,200 meters over 95 km in a grade of 1.2%.3 The total \nlength of bridges and tunnels is 292.2 km, accounting for 75.7% of the alignment. The complex \nterrain, coupled with the increased weight, speed, and number of trains, adds to the importance \nof the safety of railway operations on the Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line. \n \n13.  Value added by ADB assistance. While the PRC has made significant advances in \nrailway technology, the areas of signaling and safety systems remain a challenge.4 ADB's \nfinancing will support railway safety equipment that conforms to the best international standards. \nThe cost of the equipment is relatively small compared with the cost of other capital assets or \nconstruction of a railway line, but the benefits are significant. For example, investing in a high-\nquality signaling and information system, trackside defect detectors, and advanced train control \nsystems will ensure that unsafe movements of trains are prevented and train operators have the \nnecessary and complete information needed for safe train operations, including routing, spacing, \nspeed control, protection, and shunting. Since the line has many long tunnels, emergency rescue \nfacilities and procedures are critical in preventing a disaster associated with an accident or a \ntunnel fire involving a train. The tunnel safety equipment planned for the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi section \nserves to minimize risk and mitigate any potential casualties. \n \n14.  The capacity-building component will assist the executing agency, implementing agency, \nand the Chengdu Rail Bureau in developing a strong understanding of international best practices \nin integrating safety and emergency response. Training railway staff in emergency response and \nevacuation procedures, along with recurrent emergency evacuation drills, will ensure that any \nemergency involving tunnels can be quickly dealt with by locally stationed personnel. The small \ninvestment would have a significantly high value addition, allowing considerable leverage of ADB \nfinancing. \n \n15.  New technologies. ADB financing will help introduce new and modern technologies for \nthe mountain railway line in southwestern PRC. The equipment to be procured will be the most \nsophisticated available in the market, consistent with the safety needs of operating a mountain \nrailway system with very long tunnels. Examples of this kind of equipment to be financed under \nthe project are centralized traffic control,5 train control,6 and advanced ventilation and evacuation \nsystems for tunnels. Other technologies to be installed along the railway line, such as hot box \ndetectors and train fault detection, will enable detection and provide advance warning regarding \nrolling stock failures. \n \n16.  Lessons from previous projects. Railway safety has been a major focus of ADB support \nfor PRC railways. In 2007, ADB provided a loan to develop emergency rescue and restoration \nsystems.7 More  recently,  the  program  for  energy  efficiency  and  railway  safety  supported \ninstallation of energy-efficient power supply equipment, railway electrification systems, and rail \ntrack safety.8 In 2011, the safety of long tunnels and related emergency rescue plans and \n                                                \n3  A grade of 1.2% means a 12-meter increase in elevation over a 1,000-meter length. \n4  This is evident from the railway accident that occurred in 2011 near Wenzhou when two high-speed trains collided \nowing to serious design flaws in crucial signaling equipment. \n5  Centralized traffic control refers to centralized railway signaling management that controls railway traffic flows through \na control panel, which graphically depicts the entire railway line. \n6  A train control system is a signaling, control, and train protection system designed to replace conventional track \nsignals and prevent overspeeding. It helps eliminate accidents owing to human error. \n7  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nequipment were a particular focus of ADB technical assistance to study Europe\u2019s longest tunnels, \nthe Chunnel and the Gotthard Base Tunnel, and to evaluate international best practices. The \nproject seeks to build upon the earlier support, and provide financing, especially for safety \ninterventions for railways in mountainous regions that have unique safety requirements. The \nspecialized safety requirement for a mountain railway makes this project different from the \nprevious support and provides additional value. It is expected that the PRC will continue to expand \nthe railway network in southwestern PRC, a region where rail connectivity is presently limited, so \ntechnologies implemented in this project can be replicated in future projects. \n \n17.  Strategic priorities. The project is aligned with the strategic priority  of \u201csupporting \ninclusive economic growth\u201d of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u201320209 since \nthe railway line is in a less developed region covering two of the poorest provinces in PRC. The \nproject also supports the priority of \u201cmanaging climate change and the environment\u201d because it \nassists the development of railways\u2013a transport mode with significantly lower emissions and \nenergy consumption. It will help the PRC tackle the challenges highlighted above, and deepen \nthe cooperation between the government and ADB by helping develop the rail transport mode \ninto a safe transport system for freight and passengers. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Transport Initiative, which highlights railway development as an important opportunity \nfor sustainable transport operations.10 \n \n18.  The project is supporting the safety of the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi railway section, which is an important \nproject under the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan.11 The railway development is consistent with the \nplan\u2019s objectives of balanced development of rural and urban areas, better transport connectivity, \nand inclusive urbanization. The railway line also directly contributes to the government\u2019s Silk Road \nEconomic Belt initiative.12 It is also part of the PRC\u2019s latest medium- and long-term railway \nnetwork plan, which seeks to improve the railway system, especially in the central and western \nPRC.13 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The impact will be a developed safe, reliable, and efficient rail transport system in \nsouthwestern PRC (footnotes 11 and 13). The outcome will be a developed safe and efficient \nrailway corridor between E\u2019Mei and Miyi.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n20.  Output 1: Railway signaling, communication, and power supply system developed. \nThis will include signaling and communication equipment to improve train operation safety, such \nas centralized train dispatching and monitoring, automatic block signaling, interlocking devices, \nand train control systems. This will also cover procurement of electric power supply, and bridge \nbearings for the safety of railway bridges.15 \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2016.

The equipment will cover lighting, ventilation, \nfirefighting and fire control systems, and emergency rescue and disaster management systems. \n \n22.  Output 3: Institutional capacity for railway safety management enhanced. This will \nhelp build the capacity for railway safety measures and technology. Working with the executing \nagency,  the  design  institutes,  and  the  railway  administrations,  the  existing  institutional \narrangements for integrating safety measures in railway management will be reviewed, and \nrecommendations  made  to  make  these  more  strategic  and  focused.  Staff  from  pertinent \ngovernment agencies will receive training on railway safety, disaster prevention, and emergency \ntunnel rescue operations to better equip them to handle rescue efforts in the event of a tunnel \naccident. About 100 staff from executing and implementing agencies will be trained, and technical \nexchanges on advanced technologies and new maintenance techniques will be organized to \nfamiliarize staff in these areas. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n31.  The project will finance railway signaling equipment and tunnel monitoring and safety \nequipment. Some of the specific equipment to be procured under the project includes a train \ncontrol system with centralized traffic control, an advanced automatic block signal system, \nwayside detectors, tunnel ventilation systems, and tunnel rescue systems. The  preliminary \ntechnical specifications of the equipment have been reviewed, and it has been confirmed that the \nequipment  is  compatible  with  and  suitable  for  the  proposed  railway  line  in  terms  of  the \nrequirements of the projected rail traffic and speeds, and conforms to the best international \nstandards. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n32.  The ADB-financed components are limited to the safety systems on the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi railway \nline. However, it was not considered possible to do the economic analysis only on the safety \nequipment. The economic assessment17 has been undertaken for the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi railway line and \nthe existing railway line as a corridor, which includes track, stations, rolling stock, and other \ncomponents. The railway corridor is economically viable with an estimated economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) of 14.80%. Economic benefits include (i) user cost savings for freight and \npassenger traffic, (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight traffic, (iii) generated \npassenger and freight transport benefits, (iv) road user and shipper savings thanks to less \ncongestion and increased railway competition, (v) road accidents avoided, (vi) reduced pollution, \n(vii) fuel savings, and (viii) national productivity benefits. \n \n33.  The sensitivity analysis of potential cost overruns and benefit reductions demonstrates \nthat the railway corridor\u2019s economic viability is robust. The total cost would have to be more than \n39.3% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the threshold level of 9%. The freight \nbenefits would have to decrease by about 63.7% to make the rail corridor economically nonviable. \nCost for construction and installation and recurring fixed and variable costs carry relatively less \nrisk.  The  EIRR  is  less  sensitive  to  passenger  traffic  projections  and  delays  in  project \nimplementation. \n \n                                                \n17 Economic analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \n34.  A financial analysis18 was undertaken to assess the financial viability of the project based \non the capital cost of construction of the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi railway line. The financial internal rate of \nreturn for the project, computed after tax, is 3.71%, which compares favorably with the estimated \nweighted average cost of capital of 3.13%. The average freight rate is assumed to increase by an \nannual 3%, and average passenger revenue rates are assumed to increase in real terms annually \nby an average 4% for express trains and 2% for conventional slower-speed trains until 2035. \nThese increases also include the higher charges expected from moving high-value cargo such as \ncontainers and time-sensitive perishable goods, and from express freight services. The E\u2019Mei\u2013\nMiyi railway line will also provide passengers with significantly faster and better services, thus \njustifying an increase in fares. During 2011\u20132015, the average freight rate of the CRC increased \nby 5.9% and the passenger rate by 4.8% annually. The government is also implementing tariff \nreforms that will allow the CRC to set tariffs based on market conditions and cost increases. This \nwill contribute to greater financial sustainability of the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n35.  Financial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects19 \nand Financial Due Diligence: a Methodology Note20 and related Technical Guidance Notes. The \nFMA concluded that the capacity of both the CRC and CKRC is adequate and the overall financial \nmanagement risk is moderate. The CRC has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB \nprojects and an understanding of ADB procurement, disbursement, and financial management \nprocedures. The FMA recommended that CKRC further strengthen its financial management \ncapability by undertaking training, particularly on ADB policy and its procedural requirements for \nfinancial management, including financial reporting and disbursement.21 \n \n36.  Procurement and anticorruption measures. All procurement to be financed under the \nADB loan will be done in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time). The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwill be included in all procurement documents and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the CRC. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  A social and poverty analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.22 The \nproject  impact  area  comprises  10  counties, three  of  which  (Ganluo, Xide,  and  Yuexi)  are \nprovincial-level poor counties. The project impact area contains 123 villages that are designated \nas \u201cpoverty villages\u201d.23 The main causes of poverty are low-intensity agriculture because flat \narable land is scarce, few income-generating opportunities, poor road conditions and lack of \npaved road access, and slow rail services limiting transportation of products and access to \nschools, markets, and medical services. The economic development level measured by GDP per \ncapita varies considerably within the project counties given the isolation of the mountainous \nvillages. The average GDP per capita was CNY12,000 in 2014 across the three poor counties of \n                                                \n18 Financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. 2005.

For poor households in \nthese counties, the average GDP per capita was CNY5,500. \n \n38.  Project beneficiaries. The direct beneficiaries include existing rail users and road users, \nincluding women, who may transfer to rail to save on time and transport cost (freight carriers and \nbus  passengers),  while  indirect  beneficiaries  include  general  goods  and  service  providers, \nsuppliers of agricultural products and services, people engaged in marketing (producers and \nconsumers), and stakeholder agencies. Ethnic minority people from Qiang, Yi, and Zang groups, \nwho are dependent on agriculture and livestock, are one of the major direct beneficiary groups. \nThe Yi is the overwhelming majority ethnic group (after Han) in the three poorest counties in the \nproject impact area (accounting for 75%\u201391% of the population). \n \n39.  The  railway  line  has  the  potential  to  benefit  people  in  the  project  area  through \n(i) employment during construction; (ii) better access to markets, transport, and other services; \nand (iii) integration of the project area with regional trade and commerce. Rural households will \nincrease and diversify agricultural production to more market-oriented agriculture because of \nexpanded access to markets and the ability to move bulk goods, improving their quality of life \nthanks to better access to goods, services, and social infrastructure at less cost. Travel time will \nbe reduced by half to tourist destinations such as Xichang in Liangshan prefecture. \n \n40.  Gender. The railway line will result in (i) greater participation of women in the labor and \ntourism markets, (ii) a rise in women\u2019s net income and savings, (iii) improved overall family welfare, \nand (iv) greater empowerment of women. Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from \nrailway  development  through  equal  access to  local  employment  and wages.  Expansion  of \nsecondary and tertiary industries will help generate additional jobs for both men and women, close \nto their homes. Since the ADB-financed project is only limited to procurement and installation of \nequipment, the project does not provide opportunities for integration of gender design elements. \nHowever, it is expected that the enhanced railway system will directly benefit people in terms of \nfaster, safer, and affordable transport and indirectly benefit women and girls in accessing new \neconomic opportunities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n41.  The project is limited to the procurement of railway safety equipment along the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi \nsection of the Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows.24 \n \n42.  Environment,  Involuntary  resettlement  and  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C). \nEnvironmental impacts of the safety equipment installation will be limited. Occupational health \nand safety measures and attention to solid waste management will be incorporated into the \nproject  and  will  be  consistent  with  national  laws  and  regulations.  No  adverse  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples impacts are foreseen from the implementation of the project. \n \n43.  The due diligence done by the government for the E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi section of the railway was \nreviewed. The review confirmed that the railway line construction and environmental management \nplan is satisfactory and consistent with national requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement.  Safeguards  due  diligence  on  the  E\u2019Mei\u2013Miyi  section  will  continue  during  its \nconstruction. \n \n                                                \n24 ADB.

The integrated benefits and impacts are expected \nto outweigh the costs. The project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Sensitivity tests \nindicate that economic circumstances would have to worsen substantially for the investment \nprogram to lose its economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would \ndelay the realization of benefits. The CRC has successfully implemented ADB-financed projects. \nRisks associated with potential changes in government policy are minimal. An analysis of the \ndemand for railway transport shows that the southwestern PRC needs additional railway transport \ncapacity to sustain its economic development. The equipment and materials to be procured and \nincluded in this project are based on proven and most suitable international designs. The CRC \nhas experience in installing new technologies successfully, and these can be implemented within \na relatively short time. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGeological phenomenon contributes  The project is implementing advanced detection and monitoring technologies \nto unforeseen safety hazards  which will enable the mitigation of this risk. \nProject implementation delay  Design and preliminary technical specifications of the equipment have been \nreviewed, and preparation of bid documents will be closely monitored. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n45.  The government and the CRC have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.  \n \n46.  The government and the CRC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n47.
