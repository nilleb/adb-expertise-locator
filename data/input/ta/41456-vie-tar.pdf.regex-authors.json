During  the  2007  Country  Review  Programming  Mission  and  the  water  financing \nconferences held in September 2006 in Manila and March 2007 in Hanoi, the Government of \nViet Nam requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance to prepare the Da Nang \nWater Supply Project. Viet Nam is one of five target countries for ADB\u2019s Water Financing \nProgram, which aims to double ADB lending in the water and sanitation sector by 2010. The \nproject is proposed for financing under the Water Financing Partnership Facility managed by \nADB. It addresses the provision of a sustainable supply of potable water in the short and \nmedium terms for the city of Da Nang. The project is directly linked to the agenda of supporting \ninfrastructure development and public-private partnerships in infrastructure as set out in the \ncountry strategy and program for Viet Nam (2007\u20132010).1 It contributes to achieving Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7 (\u201cEnsure environmental sustainability\u201d), specifically to Target 10 (\u201cHalve by \n2015  the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  and  basic \nsanitation\u201d),2 and to the corresponding Viet Nam Development Goals.3 \n \n2.  An ADB mission visited Da Nang in August 2007 to undertake fact-finding for project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the proposed project. Agreement was reached on \nthe impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements \nfor the PPTA. The design and monitoring framework for the PPTA4 is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Da Nang is a class I city and is one of the largest in Viet Nam. The city had a population \nof about 800,000 in 2006, and this is expected to grow to 968,000 in 2010 and 1,415,000 in \n2020. In recent years, Da Nang has made rapid socioeconomic development gains. While Viet \nNam\u2019s economy is growing at more than 8% per annum, Da Nang\u2019s economy is growing \nsubstantially faster. At around 13%5 per annum in 2006, it had the highest growth rate in Viet \nNam.  This  growth  rate  places  a  very  serious  strain  on  the  city\u2019s  already  inadequate \ninfrastructure, and not least on its water supply system. The Master Plan 1996\u20132010 was \nmodified in 1999 to take into consideration this rapid growth. The new Master Plan 2010, \napproved in 2002 by the Prime Minister, reorients investment towards infrastructure. Over the \npast few years, Da Nang has constructed several industrial zones, residential estates, and \nspecial areas for the development of cultural and educational activities. Real estate construction \ncontinues apace, sparked by the growing interest of both local and international investors. \n \n4.  Increasing water demand coupled with insufficient investment in water supply service \nmanagement and water supply infrastructure has exacerbated important constraints on the \nwater supply system, as outlined below. Da Nang Water Supply Company (DAWACO) currently \nproduces about 120,000 cubic meters of water per day (m3/day) from surface water. The level of \nunaccounted for water6 is about 40%, even though most connections are operating with water \nmeters.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program, 2007\u20132010. Manila \n2  Source: UNDP website at www.undp.org/mdg/. \n3  Source: UNDP Viet Nam website at www.undp.org.vn/undpLive/Content/What-We-Do/Focus-Areas/Energy-and-\nEnvironment. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 December 2007. \n5  Source: Viet Nam Economic News Online at www.ven.org.vn. \n6  Unaccounted for water represents all the water produced that is not sold, minus identified losses and identified \nwater supplied free of charge. In comparison, nonrevenue water corresponds to all water produced that is not sold \n(whether losses are identified or not). \n ", "2   \n5.  The low service coverage of about 58%7 of the population in six urban districts is mainly \nresulting from prolonged underinvestment in asset management and water losses reduction, \nand insufficient water production and treatment capacity, compounded by rapid urban growth. \nToday, water demand is increasing quickly in line with the brisk economic growth and the \nrequirements  of  the  newly  constructed  industrial  zones  and  special  development  areas. \nHowever, coverage and access to water supply still lags at 80% of actual demand.  \n \n6.  In addition, the main source of surface water, which is treated by three water treatment \nplants, is threatened by high levels of turbidity, and by saline water intrusion during the dry \nseason. Water tariffs are not yet at cost recovery level, with adverse impact on operation and \nmaintenance,  service  quality,  and  self  financing  capacity.  DAWACO  is  still  a  state-owned \nenterprise,  but  is  to  be  equitized  in  2009.  It  employs  about  460  employees  with  a  staff-\nconnection ratio of 7 staff per thousand connections. Its annual revenues total about $3 million \nand it has fixed assets valued at over $20 million. \n \n7.  With full cost recovery, corporatization, and equitization now mandatory under the new \nWater Supply Decree 117/2007/ND-CP of 11 July 2007, DAWACO is under pressure to meet \nthe growing demand and improve its service by modernizing operations, broadening private \nsector participation, and delivering water to the city in a sustainable manner. The Da Nang \nPeople\u2019s Committee is examining the implications of the new decree and is requesting that ADB \nprovide assistance in strengthening the water operations of DAWACO in order to improve \nservice delivery, and to facilitate the pending corporatization of the utility. \n \n8.  In order to help overcome the above issues the Da Nang Water Supply Project will \naddress  in  particular  (i)  exploring  potential  new  water  sources  for  future  development,  (ii) \nimproving water production and treatment capacity, (iii) rehabilitation and expansion of the \nexisting distribution network including reducing unaccounted for water, and (iv) strengthening \nDAWACO\u2019s institutional capacity.  \n \n9.  The proposed technical assistance will focus primarily on water supply, as wastewater \nand drainage issues are being addressed under projects funded by the World Bank and the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation. The World Bank, in particular, has been successfully \nimplementing an extensive drainage and sanitation project in Da Nang over the last few years. \nThis project addresses risks to the environment and public health of urban communities caused \nby the old, fragmented, and deteriorated drainage and sewerage systems.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project\u2019s impact will be to improve urban livability and economic competitiveness of \nDa Nang through developing water supply infrastructure and sustainable provision of safe water.  \n \n11.  The PPTA will examine the constraints that most crucially affect the sustainability of \nwater  operations  in  the  city  of  Da  Nang  and  its  peri-urban  areas,  and  will  make \nrecommendations on the best way to address these. The outcome of the PPTA will be the \nagreed design of a project that will increase the level and sustainability of water service through \na combination of new investments into production capacity, extension and rehabilitation of the \ndistribution network, and an institutional strengthening program that could be implemented \n                                                 \n7  The company had about 382 kilometers (km) of main distribution pipe and 435 km in water connection pipes as of \n2002\u20132003.

The PPTA, which will be implemented in three parts, will prepare a project following the \nPrime Minister's Resolution 59/2007/NQ-CP.8 The Project will be prepared in a consultative \nprocess, and provide measures for improved access of poor households and vulnerable groups \nto water supply services. \n \n(i)  Part I: Water resources. A pre-feasibility study will include an initial assessment \nof potential water sources for future development, including but not limited to \nupgrading of existing water treatment plants and allocating water from irrigation \nfacilities. The pre-feasibility study will be based on existing reports, studies, and \ndata.  \n(ii)  Part II: Water supply. A feasibility study and basic design9 for (a) constructing a \nnew water treatment plant (Cu De) with capacity of 120,000 m3/day including \ntransmission main of about 16km length to connect to a planned hydro power \nstation on the Cu De River;10 (b) strengthening and expanding the distribution \nnetwork (including primary, secondary, and tertiary networks with 50,000 house \nconnections); (c) ancillary network equipment, including for system control and \ndata  acquisition,  a  geographic  information  system,  hydraulic  modeling,  and \nunaccounted for water; (d) strengthening water quality testing and laboratory \ninstallations;  and  (e)  infrastructure  for  resettlement  areas  of  the  project  (if \nrequired). As part of this feasibility study, there will be an assessment of water \ndemand planning, including a review and update on the water demand and \nproduction forecast up to 2025 over six districts,11 and also the residential estates \nand industrial zones in eight communes.12 Peri-urban areas will be identified \nwithin the municipality boundary that are not serviced by DAWACO. Further, the \nstudy  will  propose  localized  or  centralized  solutions  for  water  supply  and \nsanitation, as appropriate. \n(iii)  Part  III:  Institutional  development  program.  As  part  of  the  institutional \ndevelopment program, the following activities will be conducted: (a) review and \nassess the current organizational structure and regulatory aspects for the water \nsector  in  Da  Nang  and  make  recommendations  for  institutional  reform;  (b) \nprovide  options  for  equitization  and  define  a  framework  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships, and private sector participation (especially regarding the delegated \nmanagement  or  lease  of  the  water  company\u2019s  operation  and  maintenance \nactivities);  (c)  define  a  policy  for  water  conservation  through  demand \nmanagement  and  review  of  water  rights;  (d)  define  a  strategy  for  energy \nefficiency  after  completing  an  energy  audit;  and  (e)  define  a  framework  for \n                                                 \n8 The resolution states that local approval will be based on the feasibility studies' prepared under the PPTA. \n9 Preparation of the feasibility study has to comply with relevant national laws, regulations, and standards, including \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 48/2008/QD-TTg Decision on Issuance of Common General Guidelines on \nFeasibility Study Preparation for Official Development Assistance (ODA) Projects Funded by the Five Banks (ADB, \nAFD, JBIC, KfW, World Bank).

Cost and Financing \n13.  The PPTA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $1,700,000. It will be financed on a grant basis in \nthe  amount  of  $1,500,000  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund14 under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership  Facility,  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  fund  the  remaining \n$200,00015 through in-kind contribution of (i) office space (for a maximum of 20 consultants) \nwith  access  to  international  telephone  and  internet  (with  the  PPTA  consultant  paying \ncommunications costs); (ii) vehicles for site visits; and (iii) counterpart staff of about 80 person-\nmonths to support the PPTA consultant (including to provide support for topographic surveys, \nconfirming resettlement data, and collecting any other essential information the need for which \nmay be identified during the PPTA). The Government has been informed that approval of the \nPPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Da  Nang  City  People\u2019s  Committee  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  with  overall \nresponsibility  for  the  PPTA,  and  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within \nDAWACO. The PMU will be responsible for organizing the technical and administrative aspects \nof the PPTA, and day-to-day decisions affecting its conduct. The PMU will include suitably \nqualified and experienced counterpart staff to work alongside the PPTA consultants. PMU staff \nwill  include  a  PMU  director  from  DAWACO,  an  English  speaking  coordinator,  and  4\u20135 \ncounterpart personnel for engineering, institutional, and financial matters. The PPTA consultant \nwill provide full support to the PMU, and will work in close collaboration with the counterpart \nteam. A steering committee chaired by Da Nang City People's Committee comprising senior \nofficials from Da Nang City People's Committee agencies and other relevant stakeholders will \nbe  established  to  provide  guidance  and  oversee  the  PPTA  implementation.  The  steering \ncommittee will meet at least every 2 months. \n \n15.  The PPTA will require 130 person-months of consulting services (33 international and 97 \nnational). This includes 8 person-months of unallocated consulting services, including three \ninternational and five national consultants. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with \nthe ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) through \n(i) a firm, using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality-cost ratio of 80:20, \nand preparation of a simplified technical proposal; and (ii) as individual consultants for the \nunallocated  portion  of  the  person-months.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \nThe Viet Nam country strategy and program, 2007\u201320101 stresses the importance of maintaining sustainable and equitable \neconomic growth to achieve further reductions in poverty. Viet Nam\u2019s success in reducing the proportion of its population \nliving below the poverty line from 70% in 1990 to 27% in 2005 was based on rapid but equitable economic growth. The \nproposed project addresses sustainable water supply for the city of Da Nang over the short and medium terms. The project is \ndirectly linked to the agenda of supporting infrastructure development and public-private partnerships in infrastructure as set \nout in the country strategy and program for Viet Nam (2007\u20132010) (footnote 1). In addition, the project will include an \ninstitutional strengthening program to assist the Da Nang Water Supply Company in improving its efficiency and service. \nInasmuch as these measures will ultimately improve the quality of life, working environment, ability to attract investment into \nthe city, and access to services, they will indirectly help reduce poverty. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy will be \nreviewed to identify the impact of such large-scale infrastructure projects on poverty reduction in Viet Nam. \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe project will seek to improve water service delivery and expand coverage in the city of Da Nang.  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \nNot applicable. \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \nA total of 6 person-months of international and national social development consultant services and a provisional sum of \n$20,000 for the social assessment survey. In addition, 2 person-months of international and 7 person-months of national \nconsultant have been allocated for resettlement. \n3.  If general intervention, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, \npro-poor governance, and pro-poor growth)? \nThe water tariff structure will be pro-poor and focus on providing the urban poor, as well as vulnerable and disadvantaged \npeople access to service. It will use a citizen report card mechanism to measure the service performance. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.
