INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will implement phase 1 of \nthe Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Tonga. It will \nbuild  on  existing  climate  change  vulnerability  assessments,  prioritize  projects  for  climate \nresilience,  conduct  training  for  key  infrastructure  ministries  on  climate  change  adaptation \nmainstreaming, and prepare two phase 2 investment proposals (Strategic Program for Climate \nResilience) for increasing the climate resilience of infrastructure and other development projects \nin PNG and Tonga (Supplementary Annex A).1 \n2.  The TA has been developed in consultation with the governments of PNG and Tonga. \nBoth governments submitted, with Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance, PPCR phase 1 \nfunding proposals to the PPCR subcommittee in September 2010. In October 2010, funding \nwas approved in the amount of $750,000 for phase 1 of the PPCR with $500,000 for PNG and \n$250,000 for Tonga, respectively (Supplementary Appendix B). The TA meets priority needs of \nPNG and Tonga and is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic focus on promoting climate resilient \ninfrastructure  investments  through  adaptation.  The  TA  is  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific \nApproach, 2010\u201320152; the Pacific Regional Operational Business Plan3 and the Pacific Climate \nChange Implementation Plan.4 The TA will implement the PNG and Tonga proposals, financed \nby PPCR, and build on ADB\u2019s investment priorities in the infrastructure sector in both countries.5 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Climate change impacts. PNG and Tonga are highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts \nof climate change. PNG is sensitive to natural hazards such as coastal flooding, inland flooding, \nlandslides, and drought, which have severe impacts on agriculture, economic (transport and \nflood  control)  and  social  infrastructure.  PNG\u2019s  Climate  Compatible  Development  Strategy \n(CCDS)6 highlights the significant risks posed by climate change to the environment, economy, \nand population, including those resulting from natural disasters. These climate change impacts \nplace a further burden on already significant development challenges in PNG.  \n \n4.  Tonga, an archipelago of 170 small islands, is prone to tsunamis, tropical cyclones, and \nfloods. Tonga\u2019s Initial National Communication7 identified that all sectors are likely to be affected \nby climate change, with key impacts on agricultural production, coastal resources, and social \ninfrastructure. Consequently, the socioeconomic impacts of climate change in Tonga are also \nlikely to be significant. The TA will help enhance national capacity to manage climate change \nimpacts, which both countries are facing. \n \n5.  Climate change mainstreaming. In both PNG and Tonga, the value of mainstreaming \nclimate change adaptation and disaster risk management into core development planning has \nbeen recognized at the national level in policy documents such as PNG\u2019s CCDS and Tonga\u2019s \nJoint National Action Plan on Climate Adaptation and Natural Disaster Risk Management 2010\u2013\n2015. These documents provide a strong strategic foundation for efforts to integrate climate \n                                                \n1  Supplementary appendixes A and B are available upon request.  \n2  ADB. 2009.

However, both countries \nface significant challenges to operationalize adaptation strategies into sectoral planning and \ntranslate them to program and project planning and design.  \n \n6.  In PNG, the implementation of CCDS has been constrained by limited awareness of \nsuccessful  approaches,  lack  of  access  to  technical  training  and  knowledge  products,  and \ninadequate finance have constrained integration of climate risk management into infrastructure \nplanning and project design.  \n \n7.  In Tonga, similar constraints in awareness, finance and technical capacity exist for \nmainstreaming climate change adaptation. Beyond the Ministry of Environment and Climate \nChange, limited attention has been given to climate risk concerns in national and sector policy \nplanning and budgeting and project design. Efforts were initiated to incorporate climate change \nand disaster risk management considerations with cabinet endorsement of the Joint National \nAction Plan on Climate Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management, 2010\u20132015. Early progress \nincludes  ensuring  the  incorporation  of  disaster  risk  management  in  local  building  codes. \nHowever, implementation is slow as there is a lack of access to technical training, knowledge \nproducts and capacity building. Climate risk management is yet to be fully integrated into policy, \nplanning, and budgetary processes.  \n \n8.  During TA fact finding missions, a stocktake of government and development partner \nclimate change adaptation activities by the respective governments was undertaken in both \ncountries. This revealed that a coordinated development partners\u2019 approach to climate change \nadaptation mainstreaming is needed. Such an approach must be supported at the country level, \nwith strong engagement from coordinating and sector agencies, local government and civil \nsociety stakeholders.  \n \n9.  Climate-resilient infrastructure, especially transport infrastructure, is essential for efficient \nflow of produce to markets and for the provision of essential services and consumer goods to \nrural and urban communities. Building climate resilient infrastructure will help each of the two \ncountries in their poverty reduction, education and health programs in accordance with the \nMillennium  Development  Goals.  Properly  planned,  appropriately  designed  and  prioritized \nrehabilitation and maintenance of climate-resilient infrastructure will underpin economic and \nsocial development.  In both PNG and Tonga, significant infrastructure investments have been \nplanned, and risks to infrastructure due to climate change have been identified in key national \ndocuments. \n \n10.  In view of the above, the need to enhance institutional capacity for mainstreaming \nclimate  change  resilience  into  policies,  plans,  and  operational  activities  of  the  ministries \nresponsible for infrastructure is evident. Civil society and private sector engagement and gender \nconsiderations  in  infrastructure  resilience-building  must  also  be  strengthened  given  the \nimportant roles of these actors in climate resilience building.  Strengthening institutional capacity \nwill in turn facilitate the flow of investment funds for climate-resilient infrastructure. The TA will \nraise awareness and provide critical technical assistance and training for PNG and Tonga \nofficials to mainstream climate change adaptation and disaster risk management considerations \nat the operational level.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.   The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  climate-resilient  infrastructure  development  planning, \nbudgeting, and implementation by the PNG and Tonga governments. The outcome will be two \nStrategic Programs for Climate Change Resilience (SPCRs) for 2011\u20132015 for investments in \nPNG and Tonga, respectively, agreed by the two governments and approved by the PPCR sub- \ncommittee. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.   Two investment programs (SPCRs for PPCR phase 2) for PNG and Tonga will be \ndeveloped  to  mainstream  climate  resilience  in  national  development  planning  and \nimplementation based on updated assessments of climate change vulnerabilities in key sectors \nand/or regions. These assessments will take account of earlier vulnerability assessments that \nidentified sector and region-specific priorities. In PNG, this has occurred as part of CCDS \nformulation. In Tonga, the National Adaptation Plan of Action will, with assistance under the TA, \nhelp to incorporate climate change resilience into infrastructure planning and development. The \nSPCRs  will  identify  infrastructure  projects that  can  be  targeted for  investments,  based  on \ncurrent national development priorities and the status of government and development partners\u2019 \ninvestment pipelines. \n  \n13.   Concurrently, a capacity building program (CBP) will be developed for both countries. \nThis will commence during phase 1 of PPCR and continue during phase 2. Training programs \nfor key ministries will be initiated to facilitate integration of climate change resilience in planning, \nbudgetary systems, financial allocations and reporting mechanisms. The CBP will be based on \na needs assessment and development of approaches for effective involvement of the private \nsector  and  civil  society  in  climate-resilient  development.  Government  and  nongovernment \nengagement  will  be  facilitated  by  developing  and  disseminating  information  products  and \nidentifying  specific  opportunities  for  participation.  Information  products  on  climate  change \nscenarios,  vulnerability  assessments,  opportunities  for  private  sector  engagement,  and \nincorporating gender concerns in climate change adaptation are priority areas for the TA. A \nweb-based platform will also be developed to facilitate information generation, dissemination, \nand implementation monitoring.  \n \n14.   The  TA  will  have  two  main  outputs:  (i)  capacity  building  (comprising  training  and \nawareness raising) of key government agencies, private sector and civil society focused on \nincorporating  climate  change  adaptation  in  national  and  infrastructure  sector  planning, \nbudgeting and design; and (ii) preparation of two investment programs (SPCRs for PPCR phase \n2) which will identify investment options for enhancing climate resilience in key infrastructure \nsector programs and projects, endorsed by stakeholders, with cost estimates and indicators for \nmonitoring progress. \n \n15.   In each country, the TA will: (i) review available data and analyses on climate change \nvulnerability,  (ii)  develop  a  set  of  strategic-level  climate  change  scenarios  and  a  selected \nnumber of vulnerability assessments, (iii) undertake capacity-needs assessment for involvement \nof private sector and civil society, and  prepare information products targeted at both groups, (iv) \ndevelop  approaches  for  integrating  gender  concerns  into  climate  change  adaptation  pilot \nprojects, (v) identify and operationalize opportunities for private sector engagement in climate \n ", "4   \n \nchange adaptation, (vi)  prepare national guidelines and best practices manual for integration of \nclimate change factors into infrastructure planning, and (vii) identify financial requirements for \ninvestment projects for inclusion in the SPCR. The results of these activities will be used to (i) \nprepare SPCRs with investment proposals for enhancing climate resilience of infrastructure \nprojects,  (ii)  a  capacity-building  program;  and  (iii)  a  web-based  monitoring  platform  for \ndissemination of information products, and monitoring of programs. The web-based information \nwill include vulnerability assessments, lessons learned, progress reports, and links to regional \nand  global  climate  change  adaptation  websites.  The  information  will  be  accessible  to  all \nstakeholders.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $825,000, $750,000 of which will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Strategic  Climate  Fund  administered  by  ADB8.  Of  the \n$750,000, $500,000 will be allocated to PNG and $250,000 to Tonga. The remaining $75,000 \nwill be contributed in kind by the governments of PNG ($50,000) and Tonga ($25,000), and both \ncountries will finalize their in-kind contribution before the TA implementation. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The expected total value of investment under \nphase 2 SPCR for both countries is estimated to be $40 million consisting of $25 million\u2013$30 \nmillion for PNG and $10 million\u2013$15 million for Tonga. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will be the executing agency for the TA, which will begin \nimplementation in June 2011 and be completed by February 2012. Implementing agencies will \nbe the PPCR focal agencies in the two countries.9 To ensure whole-of-government engagement \nand coordination, the implementing agencies will consult relevant government departments \nthrough existing interdepartmental committees. The governments will also consult with private \nsector, civil society and development partners through existing consultation forums. At the \nregional level, the Pacific Department and the Climate Investment Fund (CIF) will facilitate \nregional information sharing through the Pacific PPCR, in particular the regionwide activities \ncomponent (Supplementary Appendix A). A letter of no-objection will be obtained from both \nparticipating countries prior to commencing or financing activities under the TA in the territory of \nthe participating country.  \n \n18.  TA  consultations  will  include  governments  (including  local  government  where  their \nresponsibilities  intersect  with  climate  change  adaptation mainstreaming  efforts), the  private \nsector  and  civil  society  stakeholders.  Lessons  learned  on  climate  change  adaptation \nmainstreaming and related capacity-building will be shared with: (i) other government agencies \nand  stakeholders  in  PNG  and Tonga;  and (ii)  other  Pacific  developing member countries, \nincluding through regional organizations processes and the Pacific PPCR region wide activities \ncomponent.  \n \n19.  The TA will require international (13.5 person-months) and national (10 person-months) \nconsulting services. Consultants will be recruited through a firm using quality and cost-based \nselection  (80:20)  with  a  simplified  technical  proposal.
