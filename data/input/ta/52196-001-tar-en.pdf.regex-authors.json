The proposed project will be the second Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan to Energy \nEfficiency Services Limited (EESL) of India to support expansion of energy saving investments, \nfollowing the Demand-Side Energy Efficiency Sector Project, approved in 2016.1 The project will \nfollow new business models tested and improved to exploit vast opportunities in energy-efficiency \ninvestments. Interventions will include investments in distributed renewable energy closer to the \nconsumer-end in rural agricultural areas, smart meters, and electric vehicles (e-vehicles) and \ncharging stations in various states of India.  \n \n2.  The project is aligned with the following impact: emissions intensity of economy reduced.2 \nThe project will have the following outcome: electricity end-use efficiency in the project areas \nincreased. The project will have two outputs: Output 1: Energy-efficient technologies promoted and \ndeployed in eligible states; and Output 2: End-user energy-efficiency awareness and capacity \nincreased. ADB will provide a sovereign guaranteed loan of $250 million from its ordinary capital \nresources. The Clean Technology Fund will provide loan cofinancing of $46 million equivalent, to \nbe  administered  by  ADB.  EESL  is  proceeding  with  advance  procurement  actions  for \nthree subprojects under output 1. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will support EESL in implementing the proposed \nproject. The TA will provide support for (i) project management consultants (primarily monitoring \nand reporting), (ii) key elements of the gender action plan, (iii) identification and development of \nremaining subprojects, and (iv) mapping of candidate sites for vehicle charging systems. The TA \nwill support EESL in project management, technology and business model analyses, workshops \nand seminars, and selective pilot-testing of new and promising technologies or business models \nthat can be rapidly deployed at scale through the project. The activities to be supported by the TA \nare noncommercial, i.e., they do not generate revenue for EESL, and are additional to EESL\u2019s \nday-to-day operations. The TA is not listed in ADB\u2019s current country operations business plan for \nIndia.3    \n \n4.  The proposed project complements other ADB energy sector investments, almost all of \nwhich are on the supply-side in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. This will be \none of the few projects specifically focusing on demand-side energy efficiency and business \nmodels, which can be further scaled up in India and other ADB developing member countries. \nEESL continues to investigate opportunities to expand its services and is able to create new \nmarket opportunities through large-scale deployment of new technologies using new business \nmodels such as leasing of e-vehicles to remove up-front cost barriers to vehicle users. The \ninvestments in distributed solar utilize proven technologies combined with a  relatively new \nbusiness model in clean energy services. The TA will support continued investigation of new \nopportunities that can be rapidly scaled-up in the country through the project. \n \n \n1   ADB.

India\u2019s  Intended \nNationallyDetermined Contribution: Working Towards Climate Justice. New Delhi.   \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 December 2018. \n ", "2 \n5.  The traditional business model of energy service companies (ESCOs) has worked to a \nlimited extent but continues to evolve: EESL is expanding its market scope to include upstream \nefficiency opportunities that have not been targeted by traditional ESCO investments. New \nbusiness models are being tested and improved to address more expansive opportunities, \nincluding e-mobility and distributed renewable energy in the \u201clast mile\u201d of on-grid supply to rural \nagricultural areas.4 Additional opportunities exist in energy supply chains and other infrastructure \nservices characterized by significant consumption of energy or other resources, e.g., value-added \nagricultural processing, water supply, and wastewater treatment.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output  1:  New  energy-efficiency  business  opportunities  identified.  The  TA  will \nfacilitate the organic growth of EESL through expansion of its activities with existing clients and \nidentification of opportunities to gain new clients, including potential deployment of advanced \ntechnologies for identified and/or future subprojects under the  proposed project. Expanded \nservices will build on existing programs of lighting, pumping, buildings, smart metering, distributed \non-grid renewable energy, and e-mobility. EESL routinely conducts pilot tests as part of its \nbusiness development operations. Under the TA project, EESL will pilot-test new technologies \nand business models. Pilot tests will be considered in cases where there is demand from existing \nand potential new clients of EESL, identified sites for installation and operation, and where a \nsuccessful prototype operation can be scaled up in an ensuing project or subproject under \nongoing ADB-funded investment operations. Pilot tests should not result in any potential adverse \nenvironmental and/or social impacts, and should be Category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous people.  \n \n7.  Output 2: Project management improved and streamlined. The TA will support EESL \nin implementing the project (para. 3) and streamlining business operations, primarily through \ndigitization and automation of internal processes. Key activities to be supported are:  \n \n(i)  Monitoring,  reporting,  and  verifying  energy  savings  to  meet  ADB  project \nimplementation  requirements  and  reporting  requirements  under  the  Clean \nTechnology Fund results framework;  \n(ii)  Financial management and procurement following ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time);  \n(iii)  Implementation of the gender action plan for the project including documenting and \nimplementing  best  practices  for effective  gender  mainstreaming  in  energy-\nefficiency investments and internally within EESL; and \n(iv)  Streamlining  subprojects  identification,  selection,  design,  appraisal,  and \nimplementation. \n \n8.  These activities will be linked to activities under output 1 of the proposed project. ADB will \nalso support EESL\u2019s participation in knowledge-sharing platforms such as the Asia Clean Energy \nForum and similar events in the region, with emphasis on learning-by-doing. Social media and \nwebsites will be the primary mode of knowledge sharing. Reports, best practice guidance, \nworkshop proceedings, and other knowledge products will be published on a periodic basis on \nADB\u2019s website and social media and through conferences such as the Asia Clean Energy Forum. \n \n4  For example, e-mobility comprising a shared and connected vehicle fleet by 2030 will cut energy demand by 64% \nand carbon emissions by 37%; the benefits in public health and energy security cannot be overstated. Installation of \nrenewable energy at distribution substations will alleviate overloading and technical losses in the low-voltage \nnetworks and reduce the need for more centralized generation plants.  \n ", "3 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n10.  The  CTF  grant  will  finance  expenditures  for:  (i)  consultants\u2019  services;  (ii)  training, \nworkshops, and seminars; and (iii) pilot projects of new technologies and business models. The \nfollowing expenditures are ineligible for CTF grant funding: salaries for civil servants in recipient \ncountries, purchase of vehicles, and salaries and travel of ADB staff and consultants unless they \nare resource persons. \n \n11.  The  EESL  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB\u2019s South Asia Energy Division will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants; assist in procuring goods as necessary; organize workshops; and lead in \ndevelopment of knowledge products in close coordination with EESL.  \n \n13.
