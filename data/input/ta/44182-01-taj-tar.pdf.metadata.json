INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In view of the serious climate changes affecting Tajikistan, the Strategic Climate Fund \n(SCF)1 invited Tajikistan to participate in its Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR).2 The \nobjective of the PPCR is to pilot and demonstrate ways to integrate climate risk and resilience \ninto  core  development  planning,  while  complementing  other  ongoing  activities.  The  PPCR \nprogram has two phases. The objective of phase 1 is to develop a common vision of climate \nresilience in the medium- and long-term, and formulate a strategic program for climate resilience \n(SPCR), including the outline of an underlying investment program. Following endorsement of \nthe SPCR by the PPCR subcommittee,3 phase 2 will start. The objective of phase 2 is to \nimplement the SPCR through support for policy reform, institutional capacity building, and the \nscaling-up of investments in key sectors. Grants from the PPCR are available for detailed \npreparation of the components of the program.   \n \n2.  Tajikistan\u2019s PPCR phase 1 program (PPCR P1P) was prepared with support from the \nmultilateral development banks (MDBs): Asian Development Bank (ADB), the European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. The PPCR P1P is fully aligned with \nthe Central and West Asia Climate Change Implementation Plan 2009\u20132012,4 the Tajikistan \ncountry partnership strategy,5 and the country operations business plan.6  A PPCR stakeholder \nconsultative workshop was conducted jointly by the government and MDBs on 5 March 2010. It \nproposed activities for PPCR P1P, including the concept of this technical assistance (TA). The \nPPCR P1P activities and the TA concept were supported by the ministries and nongovernment \norganizations  and  agreed  by  the  government.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Tajikistan is a landlocked country located in southeast Central Asia. Mountains occupy \nabout 93% of the terrain, while glaciers make up 6% of the total country area. The rivers of \nTajikistan are the main sources of water replenishing the Aral Sea and provide neighboring \nareas with water for irrigation and power generation. \n \n4.  With a population of 7.2 million and a gross domestic product (GDP) of around $751 per \ncapita,7 Tajikistan has the lowest GDP per capita of the countries in Central Asia.8 Living \nconditions have worsened considerably since the early 1990s as a result of the civil war, the \ntransition process and general economic contraction, and the loss of social services. Poor land \nmanagement practices and the environmental legacy of Soviet central planning, combined with \na  multitude  of  problems,  such  as  crumbling  infrastructure,  huge  external  debt,  increasing \n                                                 \n1  The SCF is one of two climate investment funds supporting three targeted programs: PPCR, the Forest Investment \nFund, and the Program for Scaling-Up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries. These programs pilot new \napproaches to address a specific climate change challenge or develop a sectoral response. \n2  Tajikistan is one of nine countries and two regions selected to participate in the PPCR of the SCF. The nine \ncountries are Bangladesh, Bolivia, Cambodia, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Tajikistan, Yemen, and Zambia, and the \ntwo regions are the Caribbean and the Pacific. \n3  The PPCR subcommittee was established to oversee the operations and activities of the PPCR and comprises six \nrepresentatives from contributor countries and six from recipient countries.   \n4  Central and West Asia Department. 2009.

Tajikistan  is  vulnerable  to  climate  variability  and  change,  which  are  likely  to  pose \nadditional and significant risks to the country\u2019s economy, human welfare, and the environment. \nProjected climate change and extreme events, such as glacier retreats, floods, droughts, and \nmudslides,  threaten  food  security,  water  security,  energy  security,  human  health,  and  the \nachievement of Tajikistan\u2019s development goals.  \n \n6.  A large proportion of the population lives just above the poverty line, and climatic shocks \nhave the potential to tip a large percentage of the population into poverty. The adverse effects of \nclimate change will be felt most acutely by those parts of the population that are already \nvulnerable owing to gender, youth, old age, and disability. Women and children are particularly \nvulnerable.  They  constitute  the  majority  of  the  country\u2019s  poor,  are  often  charged  with  the \nresponsibility to secure water, food, and fuel for cooking and heating, and are dependent for \ntheir livelihood on natural resources that are threatened by climate change.  \n \n7.  Climate change is likely to compound existing food security issues and impact heavily \nupon those dependent on the agricultural economy. The distributional effects are more likely to \nfall upon those involved in subsistence agriculture and pastoral farming, which are dependent \non the availability of natural resources, in particular, water. Major glacier-dependent river basins, \ncontaining a large proportion of agricultural land, such as the Pyanj River basin, are increasingly \nvulnerable  to  glacial  melt  and  climate-  and  natural  disaster-induced  extreme  events. \nIncreasingly  unstable  hydrological  resources  can  threaten  upstream  ecosystems  and \ndownstream infrastructure and services, such as irrigation, hydropower, and potable water, as \nwell as vulnerable communities. Consequently, these developments could affect the economy, \nweaken  household  livelihoods,  and  potentially  have  transborder  effects  on  neighboring \ncountries. \n  \n8.  Tajikistan\u2019s scientific and hydrometeorological institutions have very limited capacity to \nconduct  basic  climate  forecasting  and  climate  change  impact  assessments,  or  to  produce \nclimate impact scenarios and risk assessment measures, especially for vulnerable ecosystems \nat the river basin level. This capacity limitation severely compromises Tajikistan's readiness to \nadapt to and prepare for climate change effects. \n \n9.  Tajikistan's  PPCR  P1P  to  address  these  issues  was  approved  by  the  PPCR \nsubcommittee  on  23  June  2010.  It  aims  to  strengthen  Tajikistan\u2019s  overall  capacity  to \nmainstream climate resiliency measures in national and subregional development policies and \nprograms, through development of the SPCR.   \n \n10.  Of the six core activities9 under the PPCR P1P, this TA10 will help the government \nimplement two adaptation activities (i.e., climate science and impact modeling partnership, and \nanalysis of a river basin approach to climate resilience). The TA will assist the government in \nformulating Tajikistan's SPCR, and based on the SPCR and the key at-risk investments to be \nidentified under this TA, projects will be prepared and subsequently administered by ADB with \nthe SCF during PPCR phase 2.   \n \n                                                 \n9  The other four activities include: (i) institutional analysis and capacity needs for climate resilience; (ii) awareness-\nraising on climate change; (iii) analysis  of sustainable land management approaches for changing climatic \nconditions, all three of which will be administered by the World Bank; and (iv) enhancing the climate resilience of \nthe energy sector, to be administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \n10 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 July 2010. \n ", "3 \n11.  A methodology to assess the risks and adaptation measures for the Pyanj River basin \nwill  be  replicable  in  other  river  basins,  including  in  neighboring  countries  (in  particular, \nAfghanistan and Uzbekistan). Results obtained from the downscaled impact models, and risk \nmanagement  lessons  at  the  river  basin  level,  will  be  disseminated  to  key  cross-border \nstakeholders. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be the strengthened ability of the Government of Tajikistan to \nmake informed decisions regarding adaptation to climate impacts. The outcome of the TA will \nbe the strengthened ability of hydrometeorological and water sector institutions to anticipate \nclimate impacts and provide resiliency measures for vulnerable sectors and river basins.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will have two components: (i) climate science and impact modeling partnership, \nand (ii) analysis of a river basin approach to climate resilience. \n \n14.  Component 1: Climate science and impact modeling partnership. This component \nhas three outputs:  \n(i)  Development of preliminary subregional hydroclimate impact models for \ncritical sectors. The TA will: (a) collect data related to hydrometeorology, global \ncirculation model projections (GCMPs) for each gas emission scenario, and other \nvarious model results and analyses; (b) determine two subregions that would \neach develop a hydroclimate impact model in consultation with the Committee on \nEnvironment Protection (CEP),11 other line ministries, and the MDBs; and (c) \ndownscale GCMPs statistically into two subregional models, model simulation \noutcomes for each land use and gas emission scenario, and develop each model \nby defining the land use and emission scenario.  \n(ii)  Training  of  government  staff  in  building  statistical  downscaled \nhydroclimate models. The activities are: (a) conducting a gap analysis of the \ninstitutional capacity and absorption and technical capacity in CEP, (b) designing \ntraining modules for national staff, and (c) conducting on-the-job training to build \nbasic capacity for hydroclimate impact model development.  \n(iii)  Development of a plan for sector-based hazard management. The TA will: \n(a) conduct a rapid risk assessment and prioritize at-risk sectors, including the \ncritical  infrastructure  investment  projects  and  vulnerable  communities;  (b) \nconduct a preliminary assessment of resiliency measures needed for sector-\nbased  national  and  subregional  investment  priorities,  based  on  downscaled \nimpact  models;  and  (c)  collect  lessons  learned  from  the  assessments  and \nprepare recommendations for sector-based hazard management.  \n \n15.  To conduct and support the required activities, a climate science and impacts working \ngroup  (located  in  the CEP  and  chaired  by  the  chairman  of  the  CEP)  will  be  established, \ncomprising key staff from line ministries and scientific institutions, and the TA consultants.

Component  2:  Analysis  of  a  river  basin  approach  to  climate  resilience.  This \ncomponent has three outputs focusing on the Pyanj River basin: \n(i)  Development of a downscaled statistical hydroclimate impact model and its \napplication by water sector institutions.  The TA will: (a) identify and collect \nexisting hydrometeorological data sets and other relevant historical data in the \nPyanj River basin; (b) collect GCMPs for each gas emission scenario, and other \nvarious modeling results and analyses; (c) statistically downscale GCMPs into \nclimate impact models, model simulation outcomes for each land use and gas \nemission scenario, and develop a single model by defining a land use and gas \nemission scenario for the Pyanj River basin; and (d) prepare river model runoff \nprojections in the Pyanj River basin and validate the projections by comparing \nthem with historical monitoring data.  \n(ii)  Development  of  an  integrated  replicable  ecosystem-based  hazard \nmanagement methodology and its application to the Pyanj River basin by \nwater sector institutions. The TA will: (a) assess vulnerability to climate impact \nin existing government and donor investments in various sectors along the Pyanj \nRiver basin; (b) prepare a draft hydroclimate hazard management methodology \nin the Pyanj River basin reflecting (1) other countries\u2019 methodologies; and (2) \nriver runoff projections that are to be prepared, to identify at-risk sectors and a \nset of investments to address climate impact vulnerability; and (c) refine the draft \nmanagement  methodology  by  conducting  (1)  a  pilot  assessment  of  climate \nimpact vulnerability around Khatlon area, and (2) a pilot application to other river \nbasins in Tajikistan to check the replicability of the methodology.  \n(iii)  Development of a sector-based hazard management investment plan. The \nplan  will  prioritize  vulnerable  infrastructure  and  ecosystems,  taking  into \nconsideration the current trends of hazards such as floods, mudflows, landslides, \nsedimentation of river beds, and land degradation. To prepare the plan, the TA \nwill: (a) assess the required water-related hazard management policies, projects, \nand  institutional  capacity,  including  the  capacity  of  central  and  local \ngovernments, communities and donors to absorb adaptation investments during \nPPCR phase 2; (b) assess the rehabilitation and modernization needs of Khatlon \narea hydrometeorological stations and river gauge networks so that the regular \nriver flow can be compared with the runoff projections that are to be prepared; (c) \nassess the benefits and challenges of scaling up the existing investments of the \ngovernment (and of development partners and MDBs), including downstream \ninfrastructure and community development projects, with incremental adaptation \ninvestments  to  ensure  transformational  potential  impact;  and  (d)  prepare  a \nsector-based  hazard  management  investment  plan  prioritizing  vulnerable \ninfrastructure,  ecosystems,  and  communities  in  the  Pyanj  River  basin,  and \nprioritize the investments in consultation with water sector institutions. \n \n17.  The  TA  consultants  for  this  component  will  be  located  in  the  Ministry  of  Land \nReclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR).   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the PPCR under the SCF, and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency and will be responsible for overall TA management \nand coordination, in collaboration with Tajikistan Resident Mission. The Safeguards and Natural \nResources Unit of the Central and West Asia Department will be the focal point in ADB. The \nCEP  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  component  1,  and  the  MLRWR  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for component 2. The CEP and the MLRWR will collaborate closely with \neach  other,  ADB  headquarters  and  resident  mission,  and  other  international  and  national \npartner organizations\u2014government organizations involved in other activities of PPCR P1P. A \nfocal point, who will be appointed by the government to oversee all six activities under the \nPPCR P1P, will ensure collaboration between the activities of the TA and the PPCR P1P. The \nCEP and the MLRWR will each appoint a TA coordinator and technical and support counterpart \nstaff, and will provide office space, electricity, furniture, and workshop venues. \n20.  The TA requires 22 person-months of international individual consultants, including a \nhazard management specialist and a hydroclimate impact modeling specialist for 5 person-\nmonths each for component 1, and a river basin and climate risk management specialist and a \nhydroclimate impact modeling specialist for 6 person-months each for component 2.  \n21.  The requirement for national individual consultants is 48 person-months, including (i) a \nhazard (climate and disaster) management specialist and a hydrometeorology specialist for \ncomponent 1; and (ii) a hydrometeorology specialist, an infrastructure management specialist, a \nsocial development specialist, and an ecosystem specialist for component 2. These consultants \nwill provide support for research and data collection and analysis. The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will be implemented over a period of 10 months, from \nSeptember 2010 to June 2011. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to the Government \nof Tajikistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience under \nthe Strategic Climate Fund for Climate Resiliency for Natural Resources Investments, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n    Data Sources and   \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nThe Government of  Outline of incremental  CEP and MLRWR  Government maintains a \nTajikistan makes informed  adaptation investments  study on hazard  commitment to address \ndecisions regarding  program for critical sectors  impacts  climate adaptation and hazard \nadaptation to climate  to formulate SPCR are  management. \nimpacts.  endorsed by the   \nOther activities conducted in \ngovernment (by May 2011). \nPPCR phase 1 through \nsupport from other donors are \nsuccessful. \nOutcome      Risk \n       \nHydrometeorological and  Target institutions can  TA quarterly progress  Key staff are not assigned to \nwater sector institutions  formulate and interpret  reports  the problem/project on a \nhave the basic ability to  preliminary sector-based    continuous basis by \nGovernment (CEP \nanticipate climate impacts,  hydroclimate statistical  hydrometeorological and \nand MLRWR) annual \nand provide resiliency  impact models (by May  water sector institutions. \nreports \nmeasures for vulnerable  2011). \nsectors and river basins.   \nTarget institutions are able \nto conduct sector-based \nimpact assessments (by \nMay 2011). \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
