The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is a leading partner in the technical and vocational \neducation  and  training  (TVET)  sector  in  Cambodia.  The  investment  component  of  ADB\u2019s \nSecond Education Sector Development Program was approved in December 2004 with $7.5 \nmillion equivalent (of the total project cost of $25 million) targeted for strengthening TVET. The \nGovernment of Cambodia has requested further ADB support for TVET to meet the growing \ndemand for a better skilled work force. In response to this request, ADB\u2019s Country Operations \nBusiness Plan1 (2007\u20132009) acknowledged the need for continuing support to TVET and a TA \nproject was included for 20082. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Phnom Penh from 7 to 11 April \n2008 and reached an agreement on the scope, objectives, implementation arrangements, cost \nestimates and financing plan, and consulting services for technical assistance (TA) for a project \nto strengthen TVET3. The TA is in line with the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, \nEmployment, Equity and Efficiency, which has private sector growth and employment, including \ncreation  of  jobs,  as  one  of  its  four  pillars.  The  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  also \nhighlights the need to create employment opportunities in both the formal and informal sectors \nand to improve the supply of qualified labor. The design and monitoring framework for the TA is \nin Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Although human development indicators in Cambodia have improved over the past two \ndecades, social, cultural, economic and geographic factors have created significant disparities. \nOf Cambodia\u2019s 13 million people, approximately 34% live below the poverty line. Cambodia is \nexperiencing impressive economic growth; in 2005 the economy grew by 13.5%, double the rate \nprojected by the Government and in 2006 the economy also grew by substantially more than \nprojected. Strong expansion of the services sector and sustained growth in industrial output \ncontributed to the economic upsurge, while agriculture\u2019s share of the economy declined from \n13.5% in 2005 to 4.4% in 2006. The workforce employed in agriculture has also declined, from \n74.7% in 1999 to 55.4 % in 2004. \n3.  A rapidly expanding economy with annual growth levels of about 10% demands a skilled \nworkforce. This poses two key challenges for Cambodia\u2014ensuring more equitable access to \nhigh-quality education to meet the emerging demand for a qualified and skilled workforce, and \ndevising development strategies to address rural poverty. It is estimated that about 300,000 \npeople enter the workforce every year. Of these, approximately 90,000 are graduates from \nprivate  and  public  TVET  providers.  The  economy  generates  approximately  150,000  jobs \nannually. In 2006, 11,000 students graduated from universities but only 10% were able to \nsecure jobs. These figures indicate that there is no dearth of labor but a shortage of people with \nadequate skills to be either gainfully self-employed or to be absorbed by the private and public \nsectors. \n4.  Meeting  the  demand  for  skilled  labor  is  constrained  by  the  low  quality  of  general \neducation. Children leaving school at any level are not very well prepared for the workforce. \nDespite rapidly increasing enrollments at the secondary level, the gross enrollment ratio is only \n60% at the lower secondary level and only 21.2 % at the upper secondary level. Of the 200,000 \nsecondary school graduates, about 112,000 go on to pursue tertiary education.4 The TVET \nsystem has the capacity to absorb only 5,000 entrants. With the scope and reach of vocational \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Operations Business Plan for Cambodia (2007\u20132009). Manila. \n2  The project was originally included in the COBP as Enhancing Secondary Education. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 May 2008. \n4  Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MoLVT) estimates, April 2006. \n ", "2 \nand technical education programs severely limited, a large percentage of young people have no \nor limited opportunity for education or skills development. This in turn limits the potential for \neconomic growth. \n5.  The demand for a skilled workforce needs to be addressed through a multifaceted \napproach with interventions situated within an overall long-term strategy to (i) expand access \nand strengthen the quality of general education; (ii) strengthen the quality of higher education, \nincluding technical education; and (iii) strengthen the TVET system so that it can respond to the \nneeds of both the rapidly growing urban economy and the underdeveloped rural economy. \nHowever, provision of education and skills needs to be complemented by strong links with \nindustry, partnerships with the private sector, and an enabling policy framework that places an \nadequate and appropriate focus on employment generation and rural development. \n6.  In Cambodia, TVET was covered by a department within the Ministry of Education, \nYouth and Sports (MoEYS) until October 2004 when responsibility for TVET was transferred to \nthe  newly  constituted  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Vocational  Training  (MoLVT).  The  Directorate \nGeneral of TVET is divided into three departments: (i) Department of TVET Management, \nresponsible for institutional management monitoring; (ii) Department of National Competent \nStandards,  responsible  for  competency  standards  and  the  National  TVET  Qualifications \nFramework (NTQF); and (iii) Department of Labor Market Information, which is also responsible \nfor managing apprenticeships. A stakeholder-based National Training Board (NTB), chaired by \nthe deputy prime minister approves a National TVET Development Plan annually which sets \noverall policy. \n7.  The  Government  has  established  a  network  of  training  institutions.  The  National \nTechnical Training Institute provides the trainers for the TVET system. There are nine \u201clong \ncourse\u201d institutions that offer diplomas and degrees to grade 12 graduates as well as certificate \ncourses  for  candidates  who  have  completed  grade  9  in  the  traditional  degree  areas  in \ntechnology and business. Nominally, these institutions meet the needs of business and industry \nfor technicians, applied engineers, and entry level accounting and administrative staff. There are \n22 provincial training centers (PTCs)\u2014two of which are now polytechnics and are counted \namong the nine institutions offering long courses, with a mandate to address the NTB\u2019s priority \nto  alleviate  poverty  and  to  provide  training  to  students  from  communes  and  towns  in  the \nprovinces.  Most  trainees  have  basic  literacy  with  higher  levels  of  academic  achievement \nrequired for IT and electronics courses. PTCs offer \u201cshort courses\u201d of 3\u20136 months\u2019 duration and \ntrain about 16,000 students a year (2007), although the certificates are not yet linked to the \nNTQF. PTCs also implement a voucher skills training program (VSTP) for rural trainees. There \nare  also  an  estimated  300  private  trade  schools,  largely  in  the  IT  sector  and  currently \nunregulated. The institutions are often insufficiently resourced, which lowers the quality of the \nprograms they offer. \n8.  ADB has supported the TVET sector through three projects: (i) the Basic Skills Project \n(which closed in February 2003), (ii) the Education Sector Development Program (approved in \nDecember  2001),  and  (iii)  the  ongoing  Second  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(approved in December 2004). Major achievements under the Basic Skills Project included  \n(i) establishing the NTB, (ii) establishing the National Training Fund, (iii) strengthening the \ncapacity of the TVET staff in MoEYS, and (iv) establishing TVET centers in selected provinces. \nThe project completion report concluded that the project achieved its development targets and \nwas  successful.  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department  assessed  the  project  as  \u201chighly \neffective\u201d and emphasized the need to strengthen institutional capacity, and to assist MoLVT \nduring the transitional phase when responsibility for TVET was moved from MoEYS to MoLVT. \nThe  Education  Sector  Development  Program  I  supported  TVET  by  increasing  the  NTB\u2019s \nautonomy over training funds and TVET centers, including upgrading old TVET centers and \nconstructing  new  ones.  The  Second  Education  Sector  Development  Program  is  further \n ", "3 \nstrengthening the capacity of the TVET system. The VSTP has been successfully piloted in \nseven provinces and covers over 66,000 trainees. However, there is no such program in the \nremaining 14 provinces, which are also poor and need basic rural skills. \n9.  The NTB, an interministerial and multistakeholder body headed by the deputy prime \nminister, provides policy guidance for skills training. It works well, but its functions, membership, \nand responsibilities need to be reviewed. The reach and quality of the training institutions need \nto be improved. Links to employment opportunities, whether through partnerships with industry \nor institutional support to promote entrepreneurship, need to be developed. A strong TVET \nsystem requires a strong labor market information system and an inventory of the labor force \nand employment statistics, which are currently lacking. \n10.  Despite the growth of TVET, the national system is perceived to be lacking relevance, \neffectiveness, and efficiency and to have weak links with labor market demands. The system \nneeds  to  be  strengthened  so  it  can  respond  to  the  rapid  economic  growth  and  provide \nmeaningful income-generating opportunities for women and other disadvantaged groups. At \npresent there is no database providing accurate labor statistics or analysis of labor demand, \nmaking responding to the needs of industry difficult. The Government needs to strengthen \ncooperation with the private sector so it can provide it with skilled labor and encourage it to \nbecome a skills provider. Given the volatility of the global economy, and the resource and \ncapacity constraints, public funds should be used to strengthen the public TVET system to \nprovide skills that need periodic upgrading but are not subject to rapid redundancy. \n11.  As a relatively new ministry, MoLVT is attempting to address complex challenges with \nlimited capacity and resources. The Government has manifested its commitment to TVET by \nincreasing  the  TVET  budget  from  $750,000  in  2006  to  $2  million  in  2009.  However,  the \nsubsector  has  received  limited  external  support.  Korea  International  Cooperation  Agency \nprovided a soft loan of $30 million in 2005 for the building and equipment for the National \nPolytechnic Institute of Cambodia. The Korea Research Institute for Vocational Training has \nprovided $1.2 million over 2 years (2006\u20132008) for research on the NTQF, setting up four \nqualification testing centers and study tours to the Republic of Korea for the staff from these \ncenters. India, under its bilateral economic cooperation program, has helped establish the \nCambodia\u2013India Entrepreneurship Development Center, The Government\u2019s National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2006\u20132010 highlights several key TVET areas but a lack of resources is \nlikely to constrain the Government\u2019s ability to operationalize the plan. \n12.  An in-depth analysis of the TVET subsector is needed to prioritize areas of need. This \nshould examine economic trends, the demand and supply of labor, the institutional capacity to \nmanage and deliver TVET, institutional upgrading needs, and the role of and partnerships with \nother stakeholders. This project preparatory technical assistance will help MoLVT to undertake \nthis analysis so that resources can be targeted to strengthen TVET and enhance its relevance. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be a strengthened technical and vocational education and \ntraining system. The outcome will be an agreed project design for strengthening TVET to help \nthe  Government  achieve  its  goal  of  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  by \nimproving the earning potential of the country\u2019s youth. \n14.  The TA will be implemented in two phases and will have the following outputs: (i) a \ncomprehensive analysis of the TVET subsector; and (ii) based on the subsector analysis, a \nfeasibility report for a focused, quality-oriented and demand-driven TVET project. The subsector \n ", "4 \nanalysis will take into account: (i) the existing capacity within the subsector; (ii) policies and \nstrategies  pertaining  to  the  subsector;  (iii)  a  functional  analysis  of  the  MoLVT  Directorate \nGeneral of TVET; (iv) past and current investments in the subsector and lessons learned from \nthese investments; (v) participation of women and other disadvantaged groups and the VSTP \nprogram; (vi) geographic dispersion; (vii) the role of the private sector as TVET providers;  \n(viii) the potential of different levels of vocational and technical education to address the needs \nof the country\u2019s rapidly growing economy and underdeveloped rural areas, and (ix) the role of \nindustry in providing support to TVET through sector councils and the potential for public\u2013\nprivate partnerships. The analysis will include a review of existing labor market studies and \nconduct  skills  demand  surveys  in  areas  identified  for  potential  support.  Based  upon  this \nanalysis, and in consultation with Government, the TA will prepare a feasibility report for a \nproject  to  strengthen  TVET  with  costs,  components,  management  structures,  monitoring \nsystems and implementation arrangements to support specific interventions that will help meet \nGovernment objectives and policies for TVET. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will interact closely with public and private providers of TVET to analyze the \ncapacity and needs for skills development. It will examine the different levels of skills needed for \ndifferent target groups. It will examine ongoing interventions and programs and ensure an \noverall  integrated  approach  of  support.  It  will  undertake  extensive  consultations  with \nstakeholders through seminars, workshops and focus groups. Based on these consultations it \nwill  recommend  (i)  policy  revisions,  if  necessary;  (ii)  cost-effective  strategies;  and  (iii)  an \nimplementation framework with costs. \n16.  The feasibility study for the proposed project will include rationale; objectives; detailed \nproject components; policy targets; monitoring indicators; an analysis of benefits, impact and \nrisks; consultant requirements with indicative terms of reference; and a project framework. The \nTA will undertake a social and poverty impact analysis and recommend strategies to improve \naccess for women and other socially, economically and geographically disadvantaged groups. It \nwill conduct studies to: (i) determine skills requirements in areas recommended for coverage by \nproject, (ii) collect baseline data and identify monitoring and evaluation indicators, (iii) conduct a \nneeds assessment, and (iv) assess the need for employment support services.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $960,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the balance equivalent to \n$160,000, through the provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation and meeting space, \ntranslation services and general office support (details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nis in Appendix 3). The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementing Arrangements \n18.  MoLVT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  and  will  provide  overall  technical \nguidance  through  counterpart  staff.  An  interministerial  steering  committee  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of state, MoLVT, will be established to provide overall guidance to the TA team and to \nensure coordination with concerned ministries, departments and central and local government \nagencies and institutions. In view of the links with the private sector, the steering committee will \nalso include two members from the private sector. The Directorate General of TVET will provide \n ", "5 \ntechnical  support.  The  Government  will  provide  (i)  qualified  staff  to  help  the  international \nconsultants  in  all  aspects  of  their  work,  including  liaison  with  concerned  agencies  and \ninstitutions; (ii) administrative and logistical support; (iii) office accommodation; and (iv) data and \nreports. \n19.  A team of seven international and eight national consultants will be recruited to provide \nspecialist services totaling 62 person-months (29 person-months of international consulting \nservices and 33 person-months of national consulting services). Consulting services will cover \nthe following areas: (i) TVET policy and management, (ii) labor economics and enterprise links, \n(iii)  institutional  capacity  building,  (iv)  agribusiness  development,  (v)  small  business \ndevelopment, (vi) information systems development, (vii) career development and guidance, \nand (viii) social equity. Consultants will be engaged through a firm using quality- and cost-based \nselection and simplified technical procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Office equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will \nbe turned over to the executing agency upon completion of the TA. \n20.  The TA will begin in October 2008 and end in June 2009. An inception report will be \nsubmitted at the end of the first month. This will be followed by a stakeholder workshop to clarify \nthe  purpose  of  the  TA,  identify  and  discuss  the  issues, and  ensure  close  interaction  and \ncoordination among all stakeholders. To ensure a widely consultative process, meetings and \ninterviews will be held at provincial and commune levels. A draft of the analysis of the TVET \nsubsector  will  be  submitted  at  the  end  of  the  fourth  month  and  presented  at  a  national \nworkshop. ADB will hold a staff review committee meeting to examine the findings of the \nanalysis and, based on the analysis and in consultation with Government, identify the most \nappropriate approach for the design of the proposed project. A workshop will be held after 7 \nmonths to present the draft feasibility report. The final feasibility report will be submitted before \nTA completion. \n \nTHE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  for  preparing  the  Strengthening  Technical  and  Vocational \nEducation and Training project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nStrengthened Technical  20% increase in the skilled  National employment data,  The overall economic \nand Vocational  work force entering the  labor force statistics and  scenario remains positive  \nEducation and Training  labor market  surveys    \n(TVET) system    Skills development will be \nrelevant and beneficiaries can \nbe absorbed \n \nGovernment continues to \naccord high priority to TVET \n \nRisks \nWeak commitment to \neconomic reform \n \nDownturns in economic \nsituation due to unforeseen \ncircumstances \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nAn agreed project  A signed MOU with the  TA final report    \ndesign for strengthening  Government on the scope,  Supporting studies and  Effective support from MoLVT \nTVET  objectives, outputs,  reports   and other stakeholders \nfinancing and implementing   \narrangements on  Risk \nStrengthening Technical   \nand Vocation Education  Weak participation and \nand Training Project  coordination among different \n  stakeholders  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy \nof the partner country. \n \n  Cambodia is experiencing impressive economic growth. In 2005 the economy grew by 13.5%\u2014double the \nGovernment\u2019s projected rate and growth in 2006 was also higher than projected. A strong expansion in services and \nsustained growth in the industrial output contributed to the economic upsurge. Private investment has risen and \ninflation is decreasing. About 74%a of Cambodia\u2019s population is engaged in agriculture and lives in rural areas which \nare highly underdeveloped. In 2004, the percentage of Cambodians living in poverty was about 34%. \n \n  Cambodia\u2019s rapidly growing economy, together with a large percentage of the population still engaged in agriculture \ncreates many challenges for Cambodia\u2014ensuring more equitable access to good quality education to meet the \nemerging demand for a qualified and skilled workforce, and devising development strategies to address rural poverty. \nIn order to assist the country to address these challenges, the midterm review of the ADB country strategy and \nprogram for Cambodia (2005\u20132009)b recognizes the need to improve the quality of education and to strengthen links \nbetween education and rural development. There is also a need to provide skills to meet the demands of the rapidly \ngrowing economy and to provide a strong and sustainable platform for continuing economic growth. \n \n  An in\u2013depth analysis of the subsector will be undertaken to help the Government to develop a cohesive institutional \nframework, including policies and infrastructure, to develop a dynamic TVET sector that can respond to the needs of \nthe rapidly growing urban economy and the underdeveloped rural economy. \n \n  Strengthening TVET by assessing the demand for skills for both for the urban and the rural sectors, providing quality \nskills, and strengthening links with employment and entrepreneurship will greatly enhance the employability and \nearning potential of the workforce. This will eventually lead to poverty reduction and sustained economic growth. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n   (cid:55)  General Intervention (GI)    (cid:134) Individual or Household (TI-H) \n   (cid:134)  Geographic (TI-G)      (cid:134) Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: \n \nThe proposed project will address issues of policy, institutional strengthening, and strengthening links with \nindustry and employer agencies, in addition to supporting training. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? \n \nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy and a gender action plan will be prepared if necessary. \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n \nFour person-months of national equity specialist under supervision of the team leader. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe proposed project will include a component that is targeted at the poor and will include a percentage of \nfemale beneficiaries. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \n  Based on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \n \n  The poor and the socially excluded will benefit from an expanded and improved TVET system and also from \ntargeted training opportunities \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe potential beneficiaries need an opportunity to develop skills that can enhance their earning potential and \nsupport for entrepreneurship/employment \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \n \nThe constraints are lack of resources and physical distance to access training. The project will address these \nthrough provision of commune-based training which has already been successfully piloted under an ongoing \nproject and provision of stipends for enterprise-based training. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nThe stakeholders are government agencies, development agencies, industry groups, employer organizations, \ncommunities, and potential trainees. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, \netc.)? \n \n  Workshops, seminars, and surveys. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  (cid:134)  Information sharing       (cid:55)  Consultation      (cid:55)  Collaborative decision making       (cid:134) Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared? (cid:134)  Yes      (cid:134)  No    Please explain. \n \n  A stakeholder analysis will be conducted and participation strategy developed during the TA as deemed \nappropriate. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n  1.
