THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guangxi  Baise  Vocational  Education \nDevelopment Project.1 \n \n2.   The proposed project will improve the supply of skilled workers in Baise municipality in \nGuangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  (GZAR)  to  support  the  transformation  of  the  local \neconomy, meet the demands of industry, and promote inclusive growth. The project will play a \ndemonstration role for the sector and provinces in creating multilevel technical and vocational \neducation (MLT) systems.2 \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Baise municipality is in one of the 14 national poverty areas in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC).3 The population of 4 million includes six main ethnic minority groups, which make \nup 86% of the population.4 Baise is being developed by the government as a new economic \nbase in the GZAR, focused on expanding and moving to higher-value-chain production in four \npriority industries: (i) aluminum processing, (ii) agriculture, (iii) tourism, and (iv) regional trade \nand logistics. As it is close to the border with Viet Nam, the municipality is well-placed to \ndevelop as an important logistical link to countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nand Greater Mekong Subregion. The strategic development of Baise supports the national \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan agenda on rebalancing the economy, and the national urbanization \nplan.5  \n \n4.  Increased  investment  in  Baise  has  led  to  year-on-year  growth  of  25.2%  but  future \neconomic  development  is  constrained  by  lack  of  a  skilled  workforce.  Baise  municipal \ngovernment (BMG) has calculated a shortage of more than 80,000 skilled workers, particularly \nin the rapidly expanding priority industries, many of which are employing new technologies. A \nmajor issue for the BMG and Baise industries and services is the number of people who leave \nthe province to obtain low-skilled work in other provinces and cities.6 Baise has trouble attracting \nskilled labor because of the salary differential and comparatively undeveloped key industries, \nand is therefore left with little choice other than to develop its local human resources. \n \n5.  To address the skilled labor shortage, Baise\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan includes a human \nresources development strategy, centered on creating an MLT system which will link academic \neducation  and  technical  and  vocational  education  (TVET)  to  help  create  higher-skilled \ngraduates. The government\u2019s National Plan for Medium and Long-term Education Reform and \nDevelopment, 2010\u20132020 identified TVET as a critical element in developing a high-skilled \nmultilevel workforce to meet the demands of industry and services in the country.7  The strategy \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Guangxi Baise \nVocational Education Development Project (TA 8448-PRC, for $500,000, approved on 4 September 2013). \n3  Nine out of the 12 counties in Baise municipality are national poverty counties. \n4  The main ethnic minority groups are Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Yi, Gilao, and Hui. \n5  National People\u2019s Congress. 2011.

", "2 \n \nin Baise aligns with two national education reforms which are changing the shape of education \ninstitutions and rebalancing the roles of academic and vocational education. These are (i) \ndevelopment of MLT systems, which create links between education levels, promote lifelong \nlearning,  and  provide  learning  pathways  and  career  development  for  students;  and  (ii) \ntransitioning some universities into TVET-applicable institutions, which promote cooperation and \ndevelopment of pathways between TVET, higher education, adult education programs, and \nindustry. \n \n6.  Development of MLT in Baise will help to address critical bottlenecks in the quality and \nsupply of human resources and is an important strategy for the BMG to support inclusive \ngrowth. MLT will build opportunities for rural and ethnic minority students to better access and \nprogress in education and enter into the rapidly changing economy. MLT in Baise will integrate \nthe education and training systems to create pathways for initial training and entry to and \nprogress within the workforce by linking the human resources and skills supply from universities, \nvocational colleges, secondary vocational schools (SVSs), and short-term migrant courses. \nBaise University, with its current three-level programs (SVS, vocational college, and university), \nand its role as the only higher education facility in the municipality,8 is well-positioned to take the \nlead  in  developing  MLT  provision  locally  and  eventually  playing  a  demonstration  role  at \nprovincial  and  national  levels.  Baise  University  has  been  selected 9  to  be  one  of  19 \ndemonstration universities in the GZAR to transition into a TVET-applicable institution with a \nfocus on developing majors that link more closely to industry needs. \n \n7.  Implementing  the  reforms  for  MLT  and  the  transition  of  Baise  University  from  an \nacademic to a TVET-applicable university will require significant capacity building; upgrades in \nTVET  infrastructure,  equipment,  and  systems;  and  the  participation  of  industry.  The \nattractiveness of TVET as an option for students has been a challenge for the BMG with low \nstudent engagement, retention, and continuation in the mid-level technician and technologist \nlevels (i.e., in the vocational college and undergraduate TVET-oriented courses), which are \npriorities for industry. The need for courses to provide industry-related TVET skills requires that \ncurrent curricula, instruction, and assessment are competency based, and are more flexible and \nresponsive. Most staff members do not have relevant industry experience and standards to \napply in the classroom or workshop. Building better partnerships with industry, involving them in \ncurriculum  development  and  training,  will  ensure  relevance  of  the  TVET  programs  and \nemployability of students. The project focus on improving quality in curriculum and teacher \ntraining, and strengthening school\u2013industry partnerships, will address these issues.10 \n  \n8.  Specialized facilities, workshops, and learning spaces will be needed to support the \nemphasis on science and technology courses and a competency-based curriculum. The new \nBaise University campus supported by the project will accommodate a multilevel system, with \nteaching and learning spaces beyond what is currently available. The new campus facilities and \nequipment will allow the MLT system to function and be responsive to industry. Features, such \nas the low-carbon photovoltaic system and Green Sustainability Center11 will serve as models of \ngreen and sustainable development for other campuses across the PRC. \n \n                                                \n8  Baise University receives students from the 22 SVSs in the municipality as well as from GZAR and other provinces. \n9  Baise University was selected by the GZAR Education Bureau to participate in the Ministry of Education national \nprogram.  \n10 The TVET Training Center under the project will disseminate good practices in curriculum, staff development, and \ncreation of industry partnerships with other TVET schools in the municipality and, eventually, regionally.  \n11 The Green Sustainability Center will develop green campus management programs; curricula and research in \nenvironment sustainability-related areas and outreach to students, staff, and local communities.  ", "3 \n \n9.  The plans for Baise to assume a regional role require innovative responses from the \neducation sector. Baise University is involved in several regional cooperation arrangements with \nother universities in Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Greater Mekong Subregion \ncountries. The project will build on these initiatives by (i) training a leadership team to support \nregional  cooperation  planning and  activities; (ii)  developing  curriculum for  majors,  such  as \nlogistics and tourism; and (iii) conducting research on the impacts of regional cooperation and \nindustry expansion on human resources and skills needs in Baise. \n \n10.  Strategic  fit.  Ensuring that graduates  are  prepared for  the  workforce  with  relevant \nknowledge and skills is a major challenge for the PRC\u2019s structural reform of the economy. The \nproject  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2010\u20132015  which  promotes \ninclusive  growth,  and  environmentally  friendly  and  resource-efficient  urban  development; \ndeveloping high-quality human resources; and accelerating education reform. The project is \naligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, the recommendations from the midterm review of Strategy \n2020 which emphasize promoting TVET to address the human resource agenda, the education \nsector strategic plan,12 and with ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015.13 \n \n11.  Incorporation  of  lessons  learned. Lessons from TVET programs in the PRC and \nglobally that have been incorporated into the project design include (i) involving industries in \ncurriculum development and training; (ii) developing competency-based curricula, teaching, and \nassessment approaches; (iii) creating learning pathways; (iv) building a learning culture for \ninnovation and reform; (v) creating an industry demand-led system through the use of labor \nmarket and student employment information; and (vi) establishing robust project monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  project  will  be  economic  development  and  industrial \ntransformation of Baise municipality. The outcome will be a high-quality, flexible, and responsive \nMLT system developed which meets industry needs.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The proposed project components and associated outputs are as follows: Output 1: \nTVET  quality  improved  and  capacity  developed.

The TVET capacity building \ncomponents  have  been  designed  to  incorporate  international  best  practices  in  MLT \ncompetency-based curricula and teaching, and school\u2013industry partnerships. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic  analysis. Developing an MLT system will improve the competitiveness of \nBaise industries and support inclusive growth. The direct economic benefits include an increase in \nthe number of graduates finding employment and better remuneration. Indirect benefits include \nimproved responsiveness of TVET to industry needs and improved quality of TVET provision that \nwill filter to other schools in the municipality. The economic analysis confirmed economic viability \nof the project. The sector wage levels and demand in Baise were projected and applied for the \nproject economic benefit quantification. The cost\u2013benefit analysis reveals the project\u2019s overall \neconomic internal rate of return at 16.7%, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n12.0%, and the overall economic net present value at CNY249.6 million. Sensitivity analysis \nindicates that the economic internal rate of return is robust against all negative impacts.18 \n \n22.  Financial sustainability. A financial sustainability analysis was undertaken during project \npreparation based on fiscal impact. It indicates that the proposed project entails manageable \nfiscal  risk  regarding  the  BMG\u2019s  ability  to  provide  counterpart  funds  for  capital  investment, \nfinance operation and maintenance cost, and service project debts. The total fiscal contributions \nto  the  project  will  be  0.13%\u20131.08%  of  the  BMG\u2019s  projected  fiscal  revenue  during  project \nimplementation,  and  at  most  0.65%  of  fiscal  revenue  for  debt  service  and  operation  and \nmaintenance during the operation period. The project is therefore considered both financially \nsustainable and has controllable risks for the BMG.19 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessment. The project will be \nADB\u2019s third loan to the BMG, which is successfully managing other projects. The financial \nmanagement and procurement capacity assessments conclude that, although Baise University \nhas financial management capacity and project management experience, it lacks experience in \nmanaging ADB projects, and thus capacity building to implement the project in line with ADB \npolicies and procedures is necessary. The GZAR Finance Department, which will operate and \nadminister the imprest account, has sufficient experience in administering projects financed by \nmultilateral agencies including ADB. The financial management assessment concluded that the \noverall risk rating is medium and recommends capacity development measures to ensure that \nthe PMO and the implementing agency are able to meet the project\u2019s financial management \nrequirements. With  mitigation,  the  PMO  and  the  implementing  agency  will  have  adequate \ncapacity for financial management and procurement. A procurement agent will be hired as per \nnormal PRC procedures, and provision has been made for training and advice to the PMO and \nimplementing  agency  in  ADB  procedures,  including  procurement,  disbursement,  project \nmanagement, and accounting systems. The financial management assessment is documented \nin the full project financial analysis. A summary is included in the PAM and recommended \nimprovements  have  been  incorporated  into the  project  design.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n                                                \n18 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "8 \n \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the BMG, the PMO, and \nimplementing  agency.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  A  social,  poverty,  and  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines. Baise municipality is one of the 14 national intensively poverty stricken areas in the \nPRC.  Nine  of  its  12  counties  are  national  poverty  counties  and  two  are  regional  poverty \ncounties. The per capita disposable income of urban and rural households in Baise is lower than \nboth the provincial and national averages.20 The majority of students at Baise vocational school \n(93%) and Baise vocational college (BVC) (78%) are from rural areas in the municipality, while \nthe majority of students at Baise University come from across the GZAR but are also largely \nrural (65%). Employment rates of graduates are 92.5% for Baise University and 93.7% for the \nBVC. Since 2012, SVS tuition has been free, and Baise University and BVC students receive a \nwide range of financial assistance from national, regional, and local sources.  \n \n25.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The poverty and \nsocial analysis revealed that 90% of the students at the Baise vocational school are female; at \nthe BVC the figure is 75% and at Baise University 55%. There are high levels of female \nenrollment  in  the  majors  of  preschool  education  and  tourism,  primarily  due  to  gender \nstereotyping  in  these  occupations  and  low  levels  in  the  priority  science,  technology,  and \nengineering majors. Given the potential that Baise municipality has to become an industrial hub, \nimprovement of TVET programs will have a substantial impact on creating economic pathways \nfor women, especially those from rural and poor areas. The social and gender action plan \nensures social inclusion and gender mainstreaming in all components of the project. Gender \nactions  and  targets  include  (i)  50%  female  participation  in  MLT  and  recruitment  outreach \nprograms; (ii) 40% female teacher participation in core teacher training; (iii) gender-sensitive \ncompetency-based curriculum development; (iv) the new campus to include separate male and \nfemale dormitories and latrines, and improved night safety measures; (v) a 35% female target \nfor civil works operation positions; (vi) a gender recognition award for industry partners; (vii) that \nfemale students are paired with mentors for career guidance; and (viii) the introduction of \nspecific measures for prevention and reporting of, and response to, sexual harassment. \n  \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  including  environmental  management  plan,  was  prepared  in \ncompliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and disclosed to affected people.21 \nEnvironmental impacts are anticipated during the construction of campus facilities, including \ninadequate waste management, noise, fugitive dust, and construction site safety. These will be \nlocalized and short term, and are adequately addressed in the environmental management plan \nand  supported  by  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  activities  under  the \nproject. Meaningful consultation with potentially affected people and project beneficiaries was \nconducted  during  project  preparation.  Environmental  complaints  will  be  handled  by  the \ngrievance redress mechanism developed for the project, coordinated by the Baise PMO. \n                                                \n20 The urban per capita disposable income average was CNY19,561 in 2012, lower than the national average \n(CNY24,565) and GZAR average (CNY21,243). The per capita net income of rural households was CNY4,774 in \n2012, lower than both the national average (CNY7,917) and the GZAR average (CNY6,008).   \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   ", "9 \n \n \n27.  No significant impact is anticipated during project operation. The project will support the \ndevelopment of a low-carbon, resource-efficient, and environmentally sustainable campus. All \nbuildings will be designed in compliance with green and energy-efficient building codes and \nspecifications.22 A photovoltaic power generation system will be installed in the campus and is \nexpected to generate around 3.86 million kwh of electricity per year, or 15% of the total demand \nof project facilities. High-efficiency heat pumps will be installed for air-conditioning (heating, \ncooling) of two project buildings, and to supply hot water for the student dormitories.23 The \nproject  will  also  support  Baise  University  in  defining  a  campus  sustainability  strategy  and \nestablishing a Green Sustainability Center. The strategy will ensure a sustainable environmental \npath for Baise University through the identification of priority sustainability programs related to \nlow-carbon,  energy-  and  resource-efficient  campus  management,  green  curriculum \ndevelopment,  and  community  environment  awareness.  The  center  will  coordinate  the \nformulation and implementation of these programs.  \n \n28.  Resettlement. The involuntary resettlement category is C. The project activities will not \nrequire  land  acquisition  or resettlement.  Resettlement  due  diligence  has  been  undertaken, \nyielding satisfactory results with no outstanding issues.  \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The indigenous peoples category is B. The poverty and social \nassessment has determined that no project activities will adversely affect indigenous peoples. \nEthnic minority students and staff make up a large percentage at each of Baise University\u2019s \ninstitutions. Baise municipality and its ethnic minority communities will benefit from increased \nnumbers of trained workers for its industries and services. As per para. 17 SR3 of the ADB \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project has included measures in the overall project \ndesign in lieu of preparing a separate indigenous peoples plan.24 An analysis of the issues \nstemming from consultations with staff, students, and other stakeholders (e.g., Baise Ethnic \nMinority Affairs Bureau) was prepared and recommended actions integrated into the project \ndesign.25 Measures include (i) data disaggregation by ethnicity for an employment information \nmanagement system, student tracer studies, and industry survey system; (ii) participation of \nteachers from ethnic minorities in training programs; (iii) development of curricula incorporating \nethnic  minority  culture;  (iv)  incorporation  of  ethnic  minority  culture  in  regional  cooperation \nactivities;  (v)  provision  of  social  indicators,  including  ethnicity,  in  the  project  performance \nmonitoring system and (vi) inclusion in the project management consultant team of a social \ndevelopment and gender specialist with expertise in ethnic minority issues. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and detailed in the risk  \n                                                \n22 Including GB/T50378-2006 (Evaluation Standard for Green Buildings), GB 50176-1993 (Thermal Design Code for \nPublic  Buildings),  DB45/T392  (Energy  Conservation  Design  for  Public  Buildings),  GB  50011-2010  (Building \nSeismic Design Code), GB 50016-2006 (Code of Design on Building Fire Protection and Prevention), Building \nEnergy Saving Design Standards in Guangxi Zhuang Minority Autonomous Region (DB45/221-2007), and other \napplicable national design codes. \n23 The heat pumps are expected to reduce electricity consumption by 2.34 million kwh per year.  \n24  \u201cIf Indigenous Peoples are the sole or the overwhelming majority of direct project beneficiaries, and when only \npositive impacts are identified, the elements of an [indigenous peoples plan] could be included in the overall project \ndesign in lieu of preparing a separate [indigenous peoples plan].\u201d ADB. 2009.
