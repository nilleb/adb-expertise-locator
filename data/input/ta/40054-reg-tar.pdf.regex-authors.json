INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting regional cooperation among \nBangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal  through  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation  (SASEC)  Program  since  2001.1  In  2003,  an  information  and  communications \ntechnology (ICT) working group was formed as one of the six priority sector working groups. At \nthe first ICT working group meeting in March 2004, the SASEC countries agreed to conduct a \nstudy for the SASEC ICT development master plan to prepare the basic framework for working \ngroup activities and identify priority cooperation projects. Subsequently, in February 2005, ADB \napproved a technical assistance (TA) grant2 to support the undertaking. During the second \nSASEC ICT working group meeting in Bhutan in January 2006, the member countries accepted \nthe SASEC ICT development master plan together with the identified priority ICT projects. The \nworking group agreed that the SASEC Information Highway Project identified by the master plan \nshould be prepared as a first priority project for immediate implementation. \n \n2.  During the third ICT working group meeting in Dhaka on 20 September 2006, member \ncountries  and  ADB  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates, \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA. This TA was prepared on the \nbasis of the outcomes reached at the meeting, and its review of data, studies, and reports.3 ADB \nManagement approved the TA concept paper on 11 August 2006. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n3.  Despite the proximity of all four member countries, the quality, capacity, and costs of \ntelecommunications vary. Major quality issues are evident in the voice networks calling across \nSASEC borders from within India to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Congestion is common \nfrom fixed and mobile operator networks. Successful connections are often affected by severe \necho or low volume. These problems are symptomatic of the data links. Microwave links from \nNepal and Bangladesh need to be upgraded as does the Bangladesh-India microwave-fiber link. \nCommunications within the region often go via third party countries, while most data traffic \nwithin the region goes via North America. Regional cross-border peering4 does not exist. Bhutan \nand Nepal are geographically landlocked with the Himalayan terrain and the borders of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China along their northern aspects, with Indian borders surrounding the \nrest of the respective countries\u2019 territory. Both aspire to competitive access with redundancy to \ninternational networks, particularly to submarine cables. Nepal has been addressing the option \nof a link through the People\u2019s Republic of China to Hong Kong, China. To date, this landlocked \nsituation has dictated the primary use of satellite communications for access and delivery of \ninternational voice traffic and more recently Internet data traffic. \n \n                                                 \n1  The program has been supported through TA 5936 (ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Identification and \nPrioritization of Subregional Projects in South Asia. Manila), TA 6010 (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation II. Manila), and TA 6297 (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for the \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation III. Manila). \n2  ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  for  the  South  Asia  Subregion  Economic  Cooperation  Information  and \nCommunication Technology Development Master Plan. Manila ($450,000).  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 October 2006. \n4  Peering is the arrangement of traffic exchange between Internet service providers (ISPs). Larger ISPs with their \nown backbone networks agree to allow traffic from other large ISPs in exchange for traffic on their backbones. \nThey also exchange traffic with smaller ISPs so that they can reach regional end points.  ", "2   \n4.  Bangladesh  and  India  have  access  to  international  fiber  optic  via  submarine  cable \nlandings including the link to Sea-Me-We 4.5 India has landings from several submarine cables. \nUnlike Bhutan and Nepal, this provides Bangladesh and India with high-capacity international \nbandwidth as well as alternative gateways and redundancy. Despite significant latent and actual \ndemand, no land-based operational fiber link is available between Bangladesh and India. The \nfirst such link is in fact the higher cost Sea-Me-We 4 submarine cable, while a relatively low-cost \nlandline option, possibly offering the most attractive cost and capacity outcome has not been \nactivated. The cross-border infrastructure among SASEC countries needs to be strengthened to \nprovide low-cost, cross-border connectivity and easier access to international bandwidth for the \ntwo landlocked countries.  \n \n5.  The  provision  of  a  cross-border  convergent 6   infrastructure  with  peering  and  a \ncompetitive  access  regime  provides  much  of  the  essential  foundation  for  SASEC  ICT \ndevelopment. The SASEC ICT Development Master Plan accordingly proposes to establish the \nSASEC  regional  exchange  as  its  first  priority  cooperative  activity.  The  SASEC  regional \nexchange with its central exchange hub and country exchange gateways would function to \nreduce user costs across borders, increase quality of service and redundancy, and provide \npeering as well as pool data traffic to increase cache opportunities.  \n \n6.  While ICT is seen as one of the keys to bringing commerce and social services to rural \nareas, village ICT connectivity is widely regarded as the most difficult poverty reduction strategy. \nThe  problems  include  sustainability,  power,  awareness,  and  language.  Until  recently  the \nsustainability challenge has proved that this connectivity has had mixed success at best. To \novercome the obstacles, the SASEC ICT Development Master Plan proposes to strengthen ICT \nrural interest by mobilizing the concept of social capital within rural communities. The concept of \nsocial capital recognizes that local networking and local information sourcing from within rural \ncommunities are powerful drivers for ICT utilization in the rural context. The villages themselves \nwill be the principal sources of information, news, opinion, and discussion within the network. \nThe SASEC regional exchange will facilitate the sharing of social capital on a regional basis. \nSince the potential impact of expanding ICT accessibility to remote rural areas is to bring ICT-\nbased services and information to the poorest 500 million people in the region, determining if \nthe village network concept is workable in the context of regional cooperation among SASEC \ncountries is important, and if so, what is a feasible model for involving the private sector for \nrolling out such facilities on a large scale. \n \n7.  An important emphasis of the SASEC ICT Development Master Plan is human resource \ndevelopment. The proposed SASEC regional exchange is designed to facilitate human resource \ndevelopment  and  other  common  national  development  policies  required  for  industry \ndevelopment and employment. The challenges for human resource development are at three \nlevels. The most basic is the need to raise ICT awareness and community e-literacy. This \nrequirement is most commonly identified with disadvantaged sectors such as the rural poor. The \nsecond is ICT vocational (nonformal) training aimed at the nonprofessional members of the \nworkforce. Numerous colleges and businesses in every country offer basic training such as web \npublishing and local area network management. Finally, a professional stream for ICT education \nand training is required for ICT industries, tertiary education, research, and development. The \navailability  of  adequate  bandwidth  and  data  peering  within  the  region  will  create  new \n                                                 \n5  The South-East Asia\u2013Middle East\u2013Western Europe (Sea-We-Me) 4 is a submarine telecommunications cable \nlinking South East Asia to Europe via the Indian subcontinent and Middle East.  \n6  The term convergence is commonly used in reference to the synergistic combination of voice (and telephony \nfeatures), data (and productivity applications), and video onto a single network. These previously separate \ntechnologies are now able to share resources and interact with each other creating new efficiencies. ", "    3\nopportunities for virtual programs based in regional universities, and targeting regional and \nglobal  markets  for  higher  education.  The  proposed  SASEC  regional  exchange  would  be \nappropriate for this purpose, foster the use of local content, and strengthen and demonstrate the \nvalue of SASEC collaboration in teaching and research.  \n \n8.  The  SASEC  ICT  development  master  plan  proposes  establishment  of  a  regional \nresearch and training center that will look after regional human resource development initiatives \ncovering all three levels of challenges. The research and training center will take charge of \nvarious  human  resource  development  initiatives  such  as  university  networking,  vocational \ntraining, school education, village development, and ICT industry development, all through the \nSASEC regional exchange.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The objective of the TA is to help SASEC countries prepare an investment project that \nwill (i) establish robust data interchange capacity for the four SASEC members with reduced \ncost and an increase in reliability and competition, replacing some microwave facilities and \nproviding efficient access, with redundancy, to submarine cables for Bhutan and Nepal; and \nreduce the dependency on satellite, enhance local peering, and reduce latency; (ii) expand ICT-\naccessibility in remote rural areas in the region by establishing village networks for SASEC \nregional village communities; and (iii) establish a regional ICT training and research center to \nprovide  a  focal  point  for  teaching,  research,  professional  development,  and  industry  and \ngovernment advice. \n \n10.  The TA outputs will include (i) an investment plan for the SASEC regional exchange \nincluding in-country gateways and cross-border access links together with applicable peering \narrangements and organizational model for operating the regional exchange; (ii) an investment \nplan for expanding ICT accessibility in remote rural areas in the region, a feasibility assessment \nof scaling up of village networks based on the social capital concept, and a feasible model for \ninvolving private sector investors to build small access network facilities through a subsidy \nmechanism; (iii) an investment plan for establishing a regional research and training center \nincluding  its  mandate  and  organizational  setup,  and  a  business  model  to  operate  it  in  a \nfinancially  self-sustainable  manner;  and  (iv)  a  feasibility  assessment  of  the  integrated \ninvestment project package.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will survey and scope potential environments for the location and operation of a \nSASEC central exchange in Siliguri,7 India, and in-country gateways in each country; and \nidentify suitable competitive options for operation including a scope of works to bring it up to a \nsuitable standard. Locations will be selected that offer the best fit for access by Internet service \nproviders,  telecommunications  service  providers,  other  carriers,  and  major  users  including \nuniversities. Location will also allow for efficient connection to the regional hub facilities. The \n                                                 \n7  Siliguri is the second largest city in the state of West Bengal connecting India to its north-eastern states and \nequidistant from the Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal borders. This area reflects the diversity of people in this \nsubregion. Given these strategic advantages, the SASEC countries agreed to establish the regional exchange \nfacilities in Siliguri at the second ICT working group meeting. Nonetheless, the TA will examine other possible \nlocations to strengthen the rationale for Siliguri. \n ", "4   \nexisting shared facilities offered by alternative telecommunications networks such as power \ntransmission networks will be assessed and explored as one of potential locations. Commercial \navailability options including long-term leasing will be considered. A site survey for microwave \nline as primary or redundancy links to each SASEC country will be conducted. The TA will also \nsurvey the existing access links between the SASEC countries and identify the optimal backhaul \nenhancements for linking the regional exchange and other infrastructure with the in-country \ngateways. Various options for fiber optic backhaul, including optical fiber ground wire that runs \noverhead on power transmission lines, will be examined. The existing cross-border fiber will be \ninvestigated. Indian backhaul capacity and access through the regional exchange from major \ncities, universities, and submarine landing stations will be identified. With the advent of Sea-Me-\nWe 4 connection in Bangladesh, the TA will identify backhaul capabilities through Bangladesh to \ncarry Sea-Me-We 4 capacity through the regional exchange. \n \n12.  The TA will develop legal instruments concerning ownership and operator structure of \nthe regional exchange hub facilities to ensure commercially competitive, nondiscriminatory, and \ntransparently  cost-based  or  retail-minus  charges  for  access  for  Internet  service  providers, \ntelecommunications service providers, and other carriers. Country regulators will be included in \nthe development of legal instruments to govern operation and encourage oversight of price \ncompetition. The applicable peering arrangements including a draft peering agreement will be \ndeveloped. \n \n13.  The TA will examine the feasibility of adopting the village network concept to expand \nICT accessibility into remote rural areas, particularly relying on various innovative technologies \nincluding wireless technology as a means to provide a last mile connection. Wireless pilots have \nbeen tried in Bhutan, and India is exploring options for village access to their connecting state-\nwide area networks. Wireless is now considered to have progressed to a point that allows for a \nmore aggressive rollout. On the basis of the examination, the TA will design the basic features \nof the telecenter model covering (i) equipment for computing, power link, Internet, and other \nfacilities to be installed; (ii) a package of e-services and e-applications to be carried out at \ntelecenters; and (iii) a management and operation structure using the social enterprise model \nincluding a subsidy mechanism.  \n \n14.  The TA will formulate an investment project suitable for ADB financing and carry out the \npreparatory studies required to examine the feasibility of each project component and to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s safeguard and other policies and requirements for possible loan financing. These \ninclude economic and financial analysis, poverty and social impact assessment, performance \nmeasurement,  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  development,  and  environmental  impact \nassessment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $500,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of the Republic of Korea. Detailed cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. The governments of the SASEC countries were advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. ADB will not finance \nany undertaking or activity in the territory of any member country unless and until it has received \nfrom the government of such member country a letter of no-objection or concurrence with \nrespect to such activity or undertaking. \n ", "    5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The concerned ministry in each TA \ncountry will be an implementing agency (IA) and coordinate day-to-day implementation of the \nTA. Each IA will appoint a project manager who will act as a focal point for TA implementation. \nThe TA will be guided by a steering committee to be formed before the start of the work. The \nsteering committee will comprise the standing member of the SASEC ICT working group in each \ncountry, representatives from the government agency of each country that is responsible for \nbuilding telecommunications infrastructure, representatives from the United Nations Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity, and the ADB \nproject officer. The steering committee meeting will be cochaired by the standing member of the \nSASEC ICT working group of the host country and ADB project officer. The steering committee \nwill review consultants\u2019 reports, reconcile different views among countries and ADB, provide \nfeedback to the consultants, and guide implementation. The consultants will attend the steering \ncommittee  meetings  with  broad  responsibility  for  liaison  and  coordination  of  committee \nmembers.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least  twice:  at  inception  and  when  the \nconsultants submit the draft master plan.  \n \n17.  The TA will require international consulting services of 12 person-months and national \nconsulting services of 43 person-months engaged from an international firm in association with \nnational firms in each SASEC country using the biodata technical proposal procedures based \non the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. The international consultants will be (i) an ICT sector policy specialist (5 \nperson-months),  (ii)  an  ICT  network  specialist  (5  person-months),  and  (iii)  a  rural \ntelecommunications specialist (2 person-months). The national consultants will be (i) four ICT \ntechnical specialists (5 person-months in India and 4 person-months in other countries), (ii) four \nrural telecommunications specialists (2 person-months in each country), (iii) a project economist \n(3 person-months in India), (iv) a financial specialist (3 person-months in India), (v) four social \ndevelopment  specialists  (2  person-months  in  each  country),  and  (vi)  four  environmental \nspecialists (1 person-month in each country). \n \n18.  The international consultants will be based in India and make periodic trips to each of \nthe other countries as work demands. The IA for India will provide counterpart staff, secretarial \nservice,  furnished  office  space  suitable  for  two  international  consultants  and  two  national \nconsultants, office supplies, local communications including Internet access, and information \nand data on the ICT sector as required by the consultants. In the other countries, the IAs will \nprovide temporary office accommodation. Each IA will assign a team of counterpart staff to work \nwith the consultants in the day-to-day conduct of the study when working in that country. The TA \nwill begin on 1 February 2007 and be completed on 30 June 2007. The consultants will submit \nthe inception report by 28 February 2007, the interim report by 30 April 2007, and the draft final \nreport by 15 June 2007. The consultant will submit the final report within 1 month after each \ncountry and ADB send their comments on the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  for  preparing  the  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation Information Highway Project, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Assumptions \nPerformance Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting \nSummary  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nEconomic growth  Reduction in the cost of data transmission  Compilation of  Peering \nand poverty  between SASEC countries by 10% per  government statistics  arrangements will be \nreduction through  annum for 5 years after project completion    agreed to by SASEC \nimproved ICT    ADB\u2019s TA review  countries \nconnectivity  Improvement of the speed for data  missions   \nbetween all four  transmission between SASEC countries by    Regional exchange \nSASEC members   30% at project completion  and in-country \n    gateways will be \nExchange of social capital between SASEC  operated to ensure \ncountry villages through the regional  commercially \nexchange within 3 years after project  competitive, \ncompletion   nondiscriminatory, \n  and transparently \nEstablishment of the SASEC education and  cost-based or retail-\nresearch collaborative network linking  minus charges for \nuniversities and vocational training  access for Internet \ninstitutes in SASEC countries within 3  service providers \nyears after project completion   and other carriers \n   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAgreed design for  Identification of project components,  Consultant\u2019s interim  Cost sharing of the \nthe loan project   including their estimated costs, and  and draft final report  project cost among \n  preliminary assessment of safeguard    SASEC countries will \ncompliance issues within 3 months after the ADB TA review  be agreed upon \nTA starts  missions    \n    The terms of ADB \nFinalization of all project features, including  financing will be \nthe scope, cost estimates, financing plan,  accepted by SASEC \nimplementation arrangements,  countries \nimplementation schedule, detailed analysis    \nof safeguard compliance issues, and   \neconomic/financial viability, within 4.5 \nmonths after the TA starts  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Particularly in the era of globalization, the role of ICT becomes increasingly important as it \nenables transmission of information and connection of one economy with other economies at a much lower cost and \nmore efficiently. Because of this, ICT has proved an effective means of empowering poor rural people in remote \nareas. Recognizing a large potential for economic growth inclusive of remote marginalized rural areas, all South \nAsia Subregional and Economic (SASEC) countries identified connecting remote rural areas to an ICT network as a \nnational economic goal; thereby empowering rural residents to actively participate in economic development \nactivities, and effectively achieving poverty reduction goals.
