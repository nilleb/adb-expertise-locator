INTRODUCTION\n1. Following a request made to the Bank in 1995 by the Government of Fiji, small-scale\ntechnical assistance was approved to review the agriculture sector in Fiji and prepare a\nstrategy for its future growth. 1 This review was conducted in close consultation with\nGovernment officials and the Bank between October 1995 and February 1996, with the final\nreport and strategy being adopted by the Government in March 1996.2 The Government\nrequested the Bank's assistance to implement the strategy, and a technical assistance (TA)\nhas been included in the 1996 program. The Bank fielded a Fact-Finding Mission to Fiji in July\n1996 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, terms of\nreference, and implementation and financing arrangements for this TA.3\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In the decade following independence, a policy of import substitution and development\nprojects was vigorously promoted, with the Ministry of Agriculture Forests and Fisheries\n(MAFF) taking the lead role. In times of high commodity prices, protected local markets and\nquality management of the various Government-funded projects and programs, this approach\nwas reasonably successful in terms of increasing production. But the costs were high and the\ngains not sustainable.\n3. The second half of the 1980s saw the continuation of a program of direct Government\ninvestment in agricultural development. This was based on the policy of growing food locally\nto replace imported food. The main commodities affected were rice, beef, dairy, poultry and\nfeed grains. There was also a drive to develop new commodity exports - notably cocoa.\nThere were a series of major loan and grant aided projects to increase production: the role of\nfarmers (the private sector) was merely to respond to the benefits provided and increase\nproduction.\n4. The Government also became involved in the processing and marketing of some goods\n(rice and cocoa). These interventions proved detrimental to industry development. The aim\nwas to fill the perceived gap in the marketing of agricultural produce, and to ensure that\nfarmers did not suffer from wide variations in price and \"exploitation\" by middlemen. The\nGovernment's pursuit of import substitution goals cost the taxpayers heavily, and raised prices\nof basic food for the urban consumer. Not only were the projects expensive, but the wide\nrange of hidden subsidies in the form of cheap farm inputs, credit, and mechanisation services\nconsumed a large portion of the national budget each year.\n5. After decades of protection and Government-led investment projects, the private sector\nhas become dependent on the Government. Farming had been, and largely still is driven by\nthe need for food (subsistence), or in response to Government direction. During the last\ndecade, circumstances have changed, and this has led to a growing awareness within\nGovernment of the importance of facilitating rather than directing the growth of the sector.\nStarting in 1989, the agriculture sector became a part of the national policy of deregulation.\nThere was a switch from licensing and import controls to tariff protection, with a gradual\nTA 2387, Agriculture Sector Study, for $1 00,000 approved on 31 August 1 995.\nEntitled \"Fiji Agriculture Sector Review: A Strategy for Growth and Diversification\". This will be published\nin the Pacific Studies Series in November 1996.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 1996.", "2\nreduction in tariffs. The monopoly status afforded the National Trading Corporation for certain\ncrops was withdrawn. There was also a change in mind-set in terms of what the Government\nperceived it was capable of doing, as well as in attitude toward the private sector. The\nfundamental basis for this change in policy is a recognition that the sector will only have a future\nin a competitive world if it becomes more efficient. The challenge that lies ahead is to develop\nthe more efficient activities (both for export and local markets) that do not depend on protection\nand direct Government involvement.\n6. The process of deregulation has not been easy, and the Government has assisted some\nsectors, notably dairying, with transitional finance. It is not uncommon for the private sector to\nexpect the Government to continue to assume a direct leadership role, and dependency on the\nGovernment remains pervasive. The private sector is finding itself suddenly faced, sometimes\nreluctantly, with unfamiliar responsibilities. Deregulation means that the private sector (farmers,\nprocessors, and exporters) has to lead the way, and set the course for the sector (which crops,\nwhich markets). The role of the Government, and its ancillary organisations such as the Fiji\nDevelopment Bank (FOB), is still very important. It is to facilitate the private sector's efforts, not\nby direct intervention in trading or production, but by the provision of cost-effective technical\nadvice, the negotiation of quarantine agreements with importing countries and overseeing their\nenforcement, facilitating the development and transfer of appropriate technologies, providing\naccess to credit for viable projects, and maintaining a stable economic environment. However,\nthe continued transition to private sector-led development is central to the future success of the\nsector.\n7. While recognizing the continued existence of sugar as a major commodity (although\nrationalization is needed), there is an urgent need to accelerate Fiji's diversification efforts.\nThese efforts need to be directed in the areas where Fiji has a competitive advantage. The\nrecently completed Agricultural Sector Review recognized areas of competitive advantage\narising from the production of high-value niche exports and traditional food crops. A strategy\nwas outlined in the Review for maximizing Fiji's competitive advantage. This strategy, which\nhas now been endorsed by the Government, has as its foundation private sector-led\ndevelopment, with the Government arid other agencies playing a facilitating role. There are\nseven broad areas of action: (i) enhancing quality and consistency of supply; (ii) safeguarding\nand commercially exploiting Fiji's favorable quarantine status; (iii) commercialization of\nagriculture; (iv) ensuring and commercially capitalizing on environmental sustainability; (v)\nimproving export market access; (vi) revitalization of agricultural research and access to\ntechnology; and (vii) improving supply and effectiveness of agricultural financial services.\n8. While responsibility for expanding the agriculture sector lies firmly with the private\nsector, other agencies have important, and sometimes critical, supporting roles to play. The\nmore important of these agencies include: (i) MAFF (quarantine - surveillance, research,\ncertification, agreement negotiation; extension in a industry focused form, research in a\ncorporatized industry responsive form; information to the farming community; and, facilitating\nthe formation of industry associations); (ii) FDB (improving the supply and effectiveness of\ncredit to the sector); (iii) Fiji Trade and Investment Board (FTIB) (promotion of incentives to\nagribusiness community; encourage foreign investment in horticultural exports and agro-\nprocessing; and facilitate negotiations on freight rates); (iv) Central Planning Office\n(CPO)/Ministry of Finance (liaison with the Bank and aid agencies on technical and other\nsupport for the implementation of the strategy; ensure adequate level and distribution of public\nsector funding for implementation of strategy); (v) Ministry of Regional Development", "3\n(coordination of Government agencies at the district level); (vi) Ministry of Fijian Affairs and\nFijian Affairs Board (priority to commercial agricultural in \"Fijians in Business\" programs); (vii)\nMinistry of Co-operatives (promotion and support for viable grower owned agribusinesses);\n(viii) Ministry of Education (curriculum development to promote sustainable commercial\nagriculture and the consumption of traditional foods); (ix) Ministry of Youth and Employment\n(promotion of viable farming activities for youths with access to land); (x) Ministry of Women\nand Culture (Women's Social and Economic Development Program); (xi) Native Lands Trust\nBoard (NLTB) (negotiate mutually satisfactory renewal of Native Land Leases; assist in\ncampaigns to reduce burning and land degradation); (xii) Pine Commission (assist in\ncampaigns to reduce burning and land degradation); and (xiii) Department of Environment\n(assist in campaigns to reduce burning and land degradation).\n9. In this private sector-led development environment the MAFF has four core functions:\n(i) information generation and dissemination, sector monitoring, and policy formulation; (ii)\ncreating an environment for private sector development; (iii) ensuring agricultural development\ntakes place within environmentally sustainable limits; and (iv) facilitating the development and\ntransfer of technology, and in particular ensuring the interests of small holders are taken into\naccount.\n10. While MAFF has an adequate number of qualified staff, most have been trained during\nthe era of Government-led development, and it is unlikely that current MAFF management\nwould be able to operationalize and then implement such a diverse strategy. Assistance is\nneeded to ensure the strategy is operationalized, and that the momentum is maintained during\nimplementation. The Bank has already played an important role by providing technical\nassistance for the development of the strategy and an earlier TA helped strengthen\nmanagement information systems within MAFF. 1 However, there is a need for strengthening\nMAFF's management capability to implement the strategy by the provision of management\nadvisory support.\n11. The demands on MAFF's Quarantine Division have greatly increased with the emphasis\nnow on high value export development. Fiji has become signatory to the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), which greatly increases the need for scientifically-based phytosanitary\nmeasures. Yet the service is having difficulty in meeting current requirements satisfactorily.\nIncreasing numbers of Bilateral Quarantine Agreements (BQAs) will need to be negotiated and\nenforced, regulatory supervision of the operations of the High Temperature Forced Air\nQuarantine Treatment (HTFA) facility is required, quarantine rules and regulations that\nminimize risk but facilitate trade and aflow farmers access to improved seeds need to be\nformulated and implemented, and public awareness of the need for quarantine developed. To\nsuccessfully meet these demands, the MAFF's Quarantine Division needs to be strengthened\nand reorganized into a modern quarantine service. New Zealand is by far Fiji's most important\nmarket and there is a long close association between the two quarantine services, which has\nprovided a good understanding of Fiji's problems.\n12. Access to effective applied research and technology is critical for the successful\nimplementation of the strategy. Key research and technology areas identified are: disease\ncontrol and management, quarantine research, food technology, agricultural engineering,\norganic production systems, and a capacity to undertake environmental impact studies for the\nTA No. 2034, Management Information Systems (MIS) for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and\nForestry. approved on 27 December 1993 for $570,000.", "4\nsector. To get the maximum benefit from the significant public resources devoted to research,\na more efficient and accountable system that is conducive to meeting industry needs is\nrequired. The present system provides little incentive to produce timely information and\ndisseminate results to the client agricultural community.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n13. The main objective of the TA is to assist MAFF management develop the capacity to\nfacilitate the efficient implementation of the private sector-led strategy for agricultural growth\nand diversification, and to liaise and cooperate effectively with the other agencies concerned.\nB.\t Scope\n14. The scope of the work under the TA will include: (i) assisting senior MAFF management\nfacilitate the efficient implementation of the private sector-led agricultural development\nstrategy; (ii) advising MAFF on how best to organize and manage the various divisions of\nMAFF in order to implement the strategy; (iii) facilitating the coordination of other agencies in\nthe implementation of the strategy; (iv) strengthening the agricultural policy analysis capability\nof MAFF's Economic Planning and Statistics Division; (v) assisting industry organizations and\nleaders on the opportunities and their responsibilities for agricultural led development in a\nderegulated private sector-led environment; and (vi) assisting developing and strengthening of\nindustry associations.\n15. The TA involves the provision of a long-term (18 months) consultant with expertise in\nagricultural economics and marketing, and two short-term (2 person months each) consultants\nwith expertise in quarantine and research management. (See Appendix 1 for terms of\nreference.)\n16. The main function of the long-term consultant is to assist the Permanent Secretary of\nMAFF facilitate the implementation of the private sector-led agricultural growth and\ndiversification strategy encompassing all four core functions of MAFF (see para. 9). The\nconsultant will have experience in policy analysis, public sector reform, and private sector\ndevelopment, and in the agriculture sector of a small island economy.\n17. A short-term consultant will prepare an action plan for the Quarantine Division\nidentifying organizational, management, and resource requirements. This consultant will need\nto be very familiar with New Zealand's quarantine requirements.\n18. A short-term consultant will prepare an action plan for agricultural research to better\nserve the needs of the private sector and to make more efficient use of the public funds\nallocated to it. The consultant will have experience with a corporatized public agricultural\nresearch organization.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19.\t The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, of which $595,400 is the\nforeign exchange cost and $54,600 equivalent is the local currency cost (see Appendix 2).", "5\nThe Bank will finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $4,600 equivalent of the local\ncurrency cost to cover local airfares, for a total of $600,000. The balance of local costs will be\nmet by the Government, which will provide, in kind, counterpart staff, office facilities, operating\ncost for the vehicle, ground transport away from Viti Levu, and local communications and\nprinting. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n20. The executing agency for the TA will be MAFF. The TA will provide 18 person-months\nof long-term consultant inputs and 4 person months of short-term consultant inputs. The TA is\nexpected to commence at the end of January 1997 and be completed in December 1998. The\ntwo short-term consultants will commence work in the second or third quarter of 1997 (timing\nwill be determined by the steering committee in consultation with the Bank).\n21. The TA will be carried out by individual consultants engaged by the Bank in accordance\nwith the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n22. The first task of the long-term consultant, in collaboration with MAFF and the steering\ncommittee, will be to prepare the phased work program and determine the appropriate timing\nfor the inputs of the two short-term consultants.\n23. The consultants will work in close collaboration with the Chief Economist in MAFF's\nEconomic Planning and Statistics (EP&S) Division. The long-term consultant will be directly\nresponsible to the Permanent Secretary of MAFF. An officer from EP&S will be assigned as\nfull-time counterpart to the TA.\n24. A steering committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MAFF and including of\nother MAFF senior management, the CPO Director, the Director of FTIB, and representatives\nof the private sector, will oversee the implementation of the TA. The committee will initially\nreview and endorse the work program prepared by the consultant in collaboration with MAFF.\nIt will subsequently meet on a quarterly basis to review implementation progress and to provide\nguidance to the consultants. Reports will be presented to the steering committee at the end of\nthe inputs of the two short-term consultants. Tripartite reviews will be held after 12 months and\nat the end of the TA. A final report will be submitted on completion of the TA.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n25. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of Fiji in\nan amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of the Management of\nthe Strategy for Agricultural Growth, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "Appendix 1, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE\nA.\t Agricultural Economist\n1.
