The  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  school \neducation have steadily, but slowly, improved learning outcomes of pupils. The national learning \nattainment test results in 2017 indicated that the proportion of nonperformers in grade 8 in math \ndecreased  to  64.9%  from  84.3%  in  2007.  Reading  comprehension  improved,  with  51.5% \nnonperformers in 2017 against 73.5% in 2007. Results in science improved slightly: 76.6% \nnonperformers against 81.8% in 2007.1 The assessment showed that girls tend to perform better \nthan boys. Girls significantly outperformed boys in reading (by 53 score points), mathematics (6 \nscore points) and science (22 score points).2  For further and sustainable improvement of learning \noutcomes in schools, the Kyrgyz government needs to deepen reforms addressing systemic \nproblems. \n \n2.  Building on the reform progress set in motion in 2010\u20132017, it will be important to continue \nto help the Ministry of Education and Science (MOES) accelerate the reform process and ensure \nsustainable deepening and expansion of reforms in key areas, i.e. teacher development, school \ncurriculum, teaching materials and e-resources, school leadership, and sector management. \nWhile the policy component of the School Education Reform Sector Development Program will \nsupport policy formulation in school education, the investment project component will help \nimprove teaching and learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in \nsecondary  and  upper-secondary  grades.  The  support  to  STEM  is  critically  important  for \nstrengthening and expand human capital to make it more gender-inclusive for labor market needs \nand  building  a  knowledge  society  in  the  country.  STEM  will  be  the  core  for  initiating \ninterdisciplinary  links  and  teaching  approaches,  project-based  learning,  and  innovations  at \nschools and universities.  \n \n3.  Improving access to public and social services is one of three pillars of the of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership strategy for 2018\u20132022.3 The proposed program \nis included in the country operations business plan, 2019\u201320214 as firm for 2020, and the \nproposed transaction technical assistance (TA) for preparing the program is indicated as firm for \n2019. The program will support three of the seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: \n(i)  addressing  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  gender  equality,  and  (iii) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity. \n \n4.  The program cost is estimated at $43.5 million, of which ADB will finance $40 million, \ncomprising a $20 million grant from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and a $20 million \nconcessional loan from ordinary capital resources. ADB will release an ADF policy-based grant \nof $15 million in two tranches of $5 million and $10 million. The $20 million concessional loan and \n$5 million ADF grant together will finance the investment project component of program. The \ngovernment is expected to provide $3.5 million counterpart financing for staff remuneration and \nper  diem,  office  accommodation  and  supplies,  secretariat  assistance,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \n5.  Outcome and impact. The program outputs elaborated in paras. 6\u20138 will lead to the \nfollowing outcome: Learning outcomes of public school students improved.

Output  1:  Quality  and  relevance  of  curriculum  improved.  The  program  policy \ncomponent will support the government in establishing (i) proper oversight, an updated and \ncomprehensive  regulatory  framework,  and  clear  procedures  for  the  process  of  curriculum \ndevelopment, periodic review, approval, and implementation, and (ii) good coordination between \nthis  process  and  textbook  procurement,  teacher  training  reform,  and  financing.  The  policy \ncomponent will also support the approval of the national standards for STEM subjects. The \ninvestment project component will finance consulting services and workshops for curricula reform \nand strengthening MOES\u2019s and education institutions\u2019 capacity to design, approve, implement, \nand review the national school education curricula. A more gender-inclusive approach to teaching \nSTEM will be undertaken, considering the different ways that boys and girls learn and subvert \ngender stereotypes that prevent girls from exceling in STEM. The project will also support revising \nSTEM subject curricula and relevant guidelines and programs to ensure proper alignment with \nthe national standards and between levels, grades, subjects, and topics. This will be important to \nenable the practice of multidisciplinary teaching approaches in STEM subjects in schools.  \n \n7.  Output  2: Quality  of  teaching  and  teacher  training  improved.  The  policy-based \ncomponent will support the government to make important and timely changes to the legislation \nand charter of the Republican Teacher Training Institute for approval of the new pedagogy \nprograms and curricula, and new licenses for the partnering pedagogy university programs that \nwill be necessary for the next major phase of the teacher education reform. Teacher categories \nwith  differentiated  salaries  will  be  introduced  to  promote  better  performance  and  self-\ndevelopment.6 The investment project component will help MOES implement the \u201cNew Teacher\u201d \nNational Teacher Development Program, which would include getting more female teachers \ntrained to handle STEM subjects and serve as models for gender-inclusive STEM-oriented \neducation. Multiple service providers will plan and implement in-service teacher training programs \nbased on careful training needs analysis. MOES will reform pre-service teacher training to align \nwith the reformed school curricula.  \n \n8.  Output 3: The network of Future Schools strengthened. Future Schools will be a \nnational  program  open  for  any  public  school  demonstrating  genuine  excellence  in  school \nmanagement, teaching STEM, extracurricular activities, and community work. The program policy \ncomponent  will  support  legislative  changes  to  provide  Future  Schools  with  the  necessary \nacademic, financial, and administrative freedoms to effectively pursue innovation and excellence \nin teaching practice. The investment project component will help MOES develop a comprehensive \noperational concept for the Future Schools program, implement the program, develop clear merit-\nbased teacher selection procedures, and upgrade the infrastructure of schools in the program. \nThe  first  50  Future  Schools  will  receive  project  support  comprising  rehabilitation,  training \nequipment and learning aids, professional development for teachers and school management in \ninnovative and experimental approaches, e-learning, and project-based multidisciplinary STEM \nteaching.  \nII.
