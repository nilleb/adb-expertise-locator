The main objective of the proposed project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is to \nprepare the Power Transmission Rehabilitation Project (the Project) and assist the executing agency \nundertaking advance procurement.  \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  PPTA is necessary on the following grounds.  \na.  The project needs to be prepared in a short period of time to meet the investment \nneeds in Armenia.  \nb.  While the Government has a plan to invest in the project, there is a need to prepare a \nfeasibility study to undertake due diligence required to process a loan for the project, \nand to prepare tender documents for the procurement.  \nc.  There is a need for expertise from a competent international consulting firm to \nprepare  the  project  and  to  assist  the  tender  process,  considering  the  technical \ncomplexity of the project.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n3.  The PPTA will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the consultants will conduct \na detailed feasibility study to assess the power sector investment requirements and identify the most \nsuitable investment subprojects. Subject to the discussions with the Government, the identified \ninvestment project will be further developed and optimized in the second phase with due diligence \nassessment in accordance with ADB and the Government's requirements. The major outputs and \nactivities are summarized in Table A4.1.  \n \nTable A4.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected \nExpected  Completion \nMajor Activities  Commencement Date  Major Outputs  Date \nPhase I \n 1.
