INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The governments of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam requested policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to support policy coordination and planning of border economic zones (BEZs). After \nconsultation in the PRC in November 2015 and in Viet Nam in April and September 2016, and \nfollow-up  consultations,  ADB  and  the  governments  reached  an  understanding  on  the  TA \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Promoting balanced regional development is a strategic priority of both governments, \nand underpins efforts to accelerate improvements to living standards in the border areas of the \nPRC and Viet Nam.2 As emphasized in the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 and \nViet  Nam\u2019s  Sustainable  Development  Strategy  for  2011\u20132020,  regional  connectivity  and \nintegration can serve as an engine of growth for underdeveloped border regions.3 \n \n3.  BEZs are instruments of investment and trade to enhance the connectivity and economic \nintegration  of  border  areas.  They  generate  opportunities  to  develop  better  supply  chains \nbetween industries in border regions and open up these areas to much larger markets, helping \nthem capitalize on local comparative advantages. \n \n4.  The establishment of BEZs was adopted as a tool to harness border development as \npart of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) cooperation framework, of which Viet Nam and \nthe PRC\u2019s border areas of Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are \nconstituents; this is reflected in the implementation strategy of the GMS North\u2013South Economic \nCorridor (linking the two countries) endorsed at the 15th GMS Ministerial Conference on 19 \nJune  2009.4 Both  governments  had  taken  this  approach  forward  in  the  early  1990s  by \nestablishing  BEZs  at  international  border-crossing  points,  notably  at  Hekou\u2013Lao  Cai  and \nPingxiang\u2013Dong Dang.5 However, the business community on both sides of the border was \nlargely absent in planning these zones, and the initiatives did not attract the level of investment \nrequired to maximize their impact.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The TA is listed in ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n5  The PRC established a border cooperation economic zone in Hekou in 1992, and expanded preferential policies \nfor the zone in 2000. In addition, the PRC established the Pingxiang Integrated Free Trade Zone in 2008. Several \nspecial economic zones had been established in Pingxiang before that. Viet Nam established a BEZ in Lang Son in \n1997 and the Dong Dang\u2013Lang Son Border Gate Economic Development Zone in 2008. The Lao Cai Border Gate \nEconomic Zone was established in 2008.  \n6  ADB. 2011. Cross-Border Economic Zone Roadmap. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 7356-REG). \n ", "2 \n5.  The  governments  of  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  requested  ADB  TA,  which  began \nimplementation in 2009, to support upgrading existing BEZs and to reinvigorate border areas.7 A \nBEZ road map, prepared under this TA, provided advice on the immediate steps to be taken \ntoward coordinated development.8 Joint commitment was marked by the 2013 signing of a \nmemorandum of understanding on BEZ development by the PRC\u2019s minister of commerce and \nViet Nam\u2019s minister of industry and trade.9 \n \n6.  The importance of enhancing cooperation at the borders was reinforced during the 9th \nMeeting of the PRC\u2013Viet Nam Economic and Trade Cooperation Committee held in Beijing in \nOctober 2015 and by the state visit of PRC President Xi Jinping to Viet Nam in November 2015. \nNegotiations  for  renewing  the  1998  Cross-Border  Trade  Agreement  were  completed  in \nSeptember 2016, and the two governments are preparing a comprehensive bilateral agreement \non establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones.10 \n \n7.  Despite recent progress, the two governments can do more to coordinate and integrate \nthe development of the BEZ-designated border areas. \n \n8.  First, economic cooperation in border areas between the two countries has been limited \nto a simple model of border trade, driven by preferential policies to facilitate duty-free trade by \nborder residents. Implementing a more comprehensive model, currently under negotiation, will \nrequire new policies, laws, and regulations, as well as a better understanding of the business \nenvironment. For instance, the development and support needs of local industries, which are \ndisadvantaged by weak supply chains and incomplete linkages to regional value chains, are not \nwell understood and must be addressed to generate additional economic activity and trade. \n \n9.  Second, realizing cross-border synergies involves continually harmonizing trade-related \npolicies, laws, and regulations; and BEZ development plans. No effective BEZ development and \nmanagement coordination platform exists to operationalize the high-level agreements that have \nso far been the core focus of bilateral efforts. This has led to limited collaboration at the local \nlevel  and  between  central  government  agencies.  Furthermore,  limited  participation  of \nbusinesses in the planning of the initial BEZs contributed to private investment falling short of \nexpectations; the absence of a forum for dialogue with the private sector remains. \n \n10.  Last, lingering inefficiencies in the BEZ operating environments constrain growth in trade. \nThe World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2015 and 2016 reports  show that administrative delays and \ncosts associated with cross-border trade remain high in the PRC and Viet Nam.11 Reducing \ninefficiencies in border clearance processes is a priority, as they add to transaction costs and \nimpede trade flows. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Developing Cross-Border Economic Zones between the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and Viet Nam. Manila. \n8  These steps included formulating and sharing master plans and a high-level agreement to proceed. Although the \nmaster plans for BEZ development, prepared on each side of the border, were shared, a joint master plan has not \nyet been agreed. A joint expert group, also recommended under the road map, has not yet been established. \nInvestments initiated in border areas identified for BEZ development have been largely uncoordinated.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA impact will be improved integration along the GMS North\u2013South Economic \nCorridor, in line with the Strategy and Action Plan for the Greater Mekong Subregion North\u2013\nSouth Economic Corridor (footnote 4). The outcome will be enhanced capacity to develop, \nmanage, negotiate, and promote BEZs in the border areas of the PRC and Viet Nam.12 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will deliver three outputs. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Policy  recommendations  for  coordinated  border  economic  zone \ndevelopment formulated. The TA will support BEZ implementation by formulating a medium-\nterm BEZ development strategy and action plans for each country and area identified for BEZ \ndevelopment. The strategy and plans will provide guidance for policy, legal, and regulatory \nimprovements; and help target investment sources and export market opportunities to inform \nBEZ promotional activities. They will also incorporate monitoring tools to measure the BEZs\u2019 \neconomic and social impact, and will be designed to reflect national development priorities. \n \n14.  Several studies will inform the BEZ development strategy and action plans, and are \nexpected to include \n(i)  an  assessment  of  existing  policies,  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  and \ninstitutional mechanisms for BEZ development and management; \n(ii)  a  market  feasibility  study  to  determine  the  competitive  advantages  of  BEZ-\ndesignated areas and industries, and assess market potential, as well as market \nsurveys to forecast potential investment demand and identify investors; \n(iii)  an assessment of border clearance processes for key goods and services to \nidentify  physical  and  nonphysical  bottlenecks  to  trade,  and  gaps  in  border \ninfrastructure and bilateral coordination; and \n(iv)  an assessment of cross-border labor and employment policies\u2014including legal \nsafeguards and mechanisms to implement labor rights and working standards\u2014\nas well as other factors of cross-border mobility, to formulate recommendations \nto strengthen and coordinate cross-border labor protection mechanisms. \n15.  The scope of research may be adjusted, as needed, to respond to issues that emerge \nduring bilateral negotiations and regional agreement implementation.13 \n \n16.  Output 2: Coordination mechanisms for the development and management of the \nborder economic zones and public\u2013private coordination strengthened. The TA will provide \nlocalized support for joint planning and coordination of provincial governments in the PRC and \nViet Nam with linkages to national processes and, where required, will support ongoing bilateral \nnegotiations to establish cross-border economic cooperation zones. The project team will work \nwith government authorities to identify the preferred support modality, and will coordinate with \n                                                \n12 Footnote 9. The designated border areas are subject to change based on the outcome of ongoing bilateral \nnegotiations and priorities identified during the inception workshop. \n13 These  include  negotiations  pertaining  to  a  forthcoming  agreement  on  establishing  cross-border  economic \ncooperation zones, and the implementation of the 2016 Cross-Border Trade Agreement. \n ", "4 \nan ADB initiative working across six countries to facilitate urban planning and infrastructure \ndevelopment in GMS border areas.14 \n \n17.  In addition, the TA will finance public\u2013private forums to strengthen coordination and help \nassess the feasibility of the BEZ development plans based on investors\u2019 needs. Private sector \nparticipants  may  include  the  GMS  Business  Forum,  GMS  Freight  Transport  Association, \nresearch institutions, and other stakeholders.15 Consultations with the private sector will serve to \nprescribe policy options to attract domestic and foreign direct investment in priority industries, \nincluding fiscal incentives, hard and soft infrastructure facilities, access to finance and capital, \nbusiness facilitation, governance, and BEZ management structure. The frequency of the public\u2013\nprivate forums will be determined based on the needs identified during implementation. \n \n18.  Output 3: Capacity building of government stakeholders conducted. The TA will \ninclude a capacity-building and training component on topics agreed at inception and that \nemerge during implementation and consultations, with the participation of resource persons (as \nrequired).  Capacity  building  may  include  on-the-job  training  for  staff  members  of  relevant \ngovernment agencies on BEZ development, management, and promotion; and on effective \nnegotiation  with  potential  investors.  The  TA  will  seek  opportunities  to  promote  knowledge \nexchange and international good practice learning. The GMS Economic Corridors Forum and \nGMS Governors Forum may also be used as venues for knowledge-sharing activities. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  help  formulate  BEZ  operational  guidelines  to  complement  training  and \nknowledge-sharing activities. The guidelines will address capacity-building needs identified by \nthe  assessment  and  during  consultations  with  both  governments  for  BEZ  development, \nmanagement, negotiation, and promotion. \n \n20.  Stakeholders  will  be  consulted  through  an  inception  workshop,  two  preliminary \nconsultations to present and discuss findings, and a final strategy dissemination and discussion \nworkshop. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund and \nadministered by ADB. The central and provincial governments of the PRC and Viet Nam will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff; office space; support for consultant \nmissions,  training,  workshops,  and  conferences,  including  document  translation  and \ninterpretation; and other administrative and logistic services. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB  will  serve  as  the  executing  agency.  The  East  Asia  Department\u2019s  Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Regional Cooperation Division will serve as the focal point \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2015.

The GMS Freight Transport Association was established in 2012 as a subsidiary body of the GMS \nBusiness Forum to highlight trade and transport facilitation issues and help identify solutions. \n \n ", "5 \nand will administer the TA in coordination with the Southeast Asia Department and concerned \nresident missions. The PRC\u2019s Development and Reform Commission of the Government of the \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (in collaboration with the Department of Finance and \nDepartment  of  Commerce)  and  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  will  share \nresponsibility for implementation, as implementing agencies, with coordination support from a \nproject consultant. The implementing agencies will coordinate with other authorities, including \nparticipating provincial authorities that manage the BEZs in the PRC\u2019s Yunnan Province and \nViet Nam, to ensure their involvement in all TA activities. Provincial authorities in Viet Nam may \nlead the implementation of selected TA outputs, where relevant. TA progress and outputs will be \npresented by relevant authorities of the PRC and Viet Nam at the GMS Governors Forum and \nGMS Economic Corridors Forum. \n \n23.  The TA will require 7.5 person-months of international consultant inputs and 12 person-\nmonths of national inputs. Given the varied and specialized nature of TA activities, consultants \nwill be recruited on an individual basis, as described in the terms of reference (Appendix 3), \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).16 \n \n24.  The  TA  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  based  on  the  activities  implemented  and \noutputs delivered, following the agreed timeline and budget. The team leader will submit an \ninception report, quarterly progress notes, and draft final and final reports. Review missions will \nbe the main mechanism to monitor and assess the TA. The outputs, particularly the findings and \nrecommendations  from  the  studies,  will  be  disseminated  through  workshops,  stakeholder \nconsultations, and publications, where relevant. Key project deliverables will be translated into \nChinese and Vietnamese. \n \n25.  The TA will begin on 1 March 2017 and end on 29 March 2019. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for the Policy Coordination and Planning of Border Economic Zones of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and Viet Nam, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n16 Consultants will be engaged on a lump-sum basis where feasible.
