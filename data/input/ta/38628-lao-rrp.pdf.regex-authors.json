An initial environmental examination was prepared. \nAssessment \n   \nProject Description  The  project  will  (i)  construct  398 kilometers (km)  of  115-kilovolt  (kV) \ntransmission  lines  with  associated  115/22 kV  substations,  and  erect \nabout 1,100 km of new 22 kV medium- and low-voltage distribution lines \nto expand access to grid electricity to consumers in western Vientiane, \nXaignabouli, and Phongsali provinces of the Lao PDR; (ii) provide no-\ninterest  credit  to  poor  households  in  the  project  areas  to  help  them \nconnect  to  the  distribution  grid;  and  (iii)  provide  consulting  services, \nincluding a project implementation consultant to Electricite du Laos (EDL) \nand advisory services to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM).  \n \nThe construction of the transmission and distribution facilities comprises \nthree  modules.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance \nmodule 1, and Korea Eximbank will finance modules 2 and 3. Module 1 \nconsists of (i) a 98 km single-circuit 115 kV transmission line from Paklay \nto Nonhai, and (ii) a 74.6 km single-circuit 115 kV transmission line from \nPaklay to the Lao PDR\u2013Thailand border near Kenthao for interconnection \nwith the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)\u2013Provincial \nElectricity Authority via the Thali substation in Loei province in Thailand. \nModule 1 will also construct a new 115kV/22kV substation at Paklay and \nexpand two existing 115kV/22kV substations at Nonhai and Xaignabouli. \nThe cross-border interconnection between Paklay (Lao PDR) and Thali \n(Thailand)  will  facilitate  power  trading  between  the  EDL  and  EGAT\u2013\nProvincial Electricity Authority systems. \n \nThe  project  under  module  2  will  extend  a  new  115 kV  transmission \nnetwork from the proposed Paklay substation to be built under module 1 \nnorthward to the existing Xayabury substation, where it will connect with \nEDL's  transmission  network.  Module  3  will  consist  of  a  115  kV \ntransmission  line  linking  the  existing  Namo  substation  in  Oudomxai \nprovince with a new substation at Boun Nua in Phongsali province. Under \nmodules 2 and 3, the project will erect distribution lines emanating from \nNonhai, Paklay, Xayabury, Namo, and Boun Nua substations. ", "ii   \nRationale  For the Lao PDR, poverty reduction and improvement of living standards \nare  important  development goals  that  are  not achievable  without  the \nprovision of basic essential services such as access to education, health \ncare, clean water, and electricity. Of the total 960,000 households in the \ncountry, about 560,000 (58%) have access to electricity. In Xaignabouli \nprovince, only 50% of households are electrified, which is lower than the \nnational  average.  Phongsali  province  has  the  lowest  percentage  of \nelectrified households in the country\u2014only 13%. Poverty is widespread \nwhere electricity is not made available to households. For example, in \nPhongsali province, 60% of households are considered poor, while in \nsome  districts  of  Xaignabouli  province,  the  percentage  of  poor \nhouseholds is as high as 50%. Recognizing the importance of provision \nof electricity for poverty reduction and for raising living conditions, the \ngovernment has set a target of electrifying 70% of total households by \n2010, 80% by 2015, and 90% by 2020.  \n \n  A  strong  transmission  and  distribution  (T&D)  network  nationwide  is \nnecessary to ensure reliable electrical supply to the population and to \nachieve the electrification targets. Presently, the T&D network of EDL \ndoes not cover the entire country. For example, Phongsali province and \nparts of Xaignabouli are not covered by EDL's T&D system.  \n \n  The  ADB-financed  Northern  Area  Rural  Power  Distribution  Project  is \ncurrently  building  the  T&D  system  covering  the  area  from \nLouangphrabang Phrabang to Oudomxai and onward to Louang-Namtha. \nAt  Louangphrabang  it  interconnects  with  the  existing  Nam  Ngum  1 \ntransmission system that covers Vientiane capital and central region of \nthe Lao PDR. This project will construct the much needed T&D system in \nXaignabouli and Phongsali provinces and in western Vientiane province. \nTogether with previous ADB-financed projects, it will help gradually build \nup a nationwide T&D system to allow the government reach the rural \nelectrification and poverty reduction goal. \n \n  Consumers  in  Phongsali  province  currently  rely  on  limited  electricity \nimports from the People's Republic of China or from individual privately \nowned  diesel  generation  sets.  Similarly,  consumers  in  Xaignabouli \nprovince rely on electricity imports from Thailand. Electricity imports in \nthese  two  provinces  are  supplied  at  22 kV  and  are  more  expensive \n($0.08 per kilowatt-hour [kWh]) than EDL's supply (about $0.05 per kWh). \nBut  more  importantly,  many  households  still  do  not  have  access  to \nelectricity.  Currently,  a  22 kV  transmission  line  provides  imported \nelectricity  from  Thailand  to  southern  Xaignabouli  province.  Once  the \nproject's 115 kV cross-border interconnection line is built, it will replace \nthe current 22 kV transmission line used for power import. This 115 kV \ncross-border  interconnection  will  have  a  much  higher  load-carrying \ncapacity and lower voltage drop; hence, it will deliver a higher quality \nelectricity supply. The 115 kV interconnection can be utilized for both \nimport  and  export  of  electricity.  Such  a  two-way  power  trade  will  be \npossible and beneficial to the Lao PDR and Thailand by making use of \nthe seasonal variations of hydro energy. \n ", "  iii \n  During  the  wet  season  (August\u2013October),  hydropower  is  normally \nabundantly available in the Lao PDR, and EDL has excess capacity. With \nthe  project,  excess  power  can  be  exported  to  Thailand,  offsetting \nelectricity generated from fossil fuel there. On the other hand, during the \ndry season (April\u2013May) when EDL experiences power shortages, it can \nimport electricity from Thailand through the 115 kV transmission line from \nthe Thali substation to supply Xaignabouli province, thereby ensuring a \nreliable supply of electricity to consumers. In addition, the interconnection \nallows the two systems to back each other up during line maintenance \nand power outages. \n \n  The cross-border interconnection under the project has received strong \nsupport from both governments and from EDL and EGAT. On 13 May \n2009, the governor of EGAT and the managing director general of EDL \nsigned a memorandum of understanding in Bangkok officially announcing \nthe agreement for the proposed interconnection. The interconnection line, \nto be built under the project and the ongoing Northern Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Transport Network Improvement Project to improve the \nroads from the Lao PDR\u2013Thailand border along Xaignabouli province \nand northward to Louangphrabang, will accelerate economic cooperation \nactivities  and  cross-border  trade  between  northeast  Thailand  and \nXaignabouli province. According to the National Economic Development \nBoard of Thailand, this corridor is one of the priority areas for Thailand\u2019s \nofficial development assistance to the Lao PDR because of the strong \ninterest  of  Thailand\u2019s  private  sector  in  commercial  agriculture \ndevelopment. Availability of a reliable supply of electricity is essential for \nbusiness in the project area. \n  Thus, the project supports the government's rural electrification program \nby  building  a  nationwide  unified  T&D  system  for  EDL,  particularly  in \nPhongsali and Xaignabouli provinces, with cross-border interconnection \nbetween the EDL and EGAT systems. Of the 18,800 new households in \nthe two provinces to be provided access to electricity, more than 6,000 \nare poor households and will receive financial support for connections to \nthe  grid.  Reliable  supply  of  electricity  will  not  only  improve  living \nconditions of the population but also boost economic activities in the \nproject area. In the long term, as more hydropower capacity is added to \nEDL's system, and power demands on both side of the border grow, this \ninterconnection will bring further benefits to consumers in the Lao PDR \nand Thailand. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact will be the realization of the government's goal of electrifying \n90% of the country\u2019s households by 2020. The household electrification \nrate in the project area (Phongsali and Xaignabouli provinces combined) \nwill increase from 39% in 2009 to 79% in 2020.  \n \nThe outcome will be increased access to reliable electricity supply for \nhouseholds, villages, and towns within the project area. About 18,800 \nnew  households  (among  them  about  6,000  poor  households)  in  the \nproject area will be supplied with reliable grid electricity. \n   \n ", "iv   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $65.32  million, \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $3.18 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Amount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  total (%) \nAsian Development Bank   20.00  30.6 \nGovernment of the Republic of Koreaa   37.88  58.0 \nElectricite du Laos  7.44  11.4 \nTotal  65.32  100.0 \na Through Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n   \nAllocation and  The government will make the proceeds of the ADB grant and the Korea \nRelending Terms  Eximbank loan available to EDL subject to the subsidiary loan agreement \nand project agreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The project will have a 4-year utilization period from the time of approval.   \n   \nEstimated Project  June 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  EDL will implement the project. \nArrangements \n   \nExecuting Agency  EDL \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed by ADB will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime)  and  the  procurement  plan  prepared  and  agreed  to  by  the \ngovernment  and  ADB.  The  threshold  limits  to  be  followed  under  the \nprocurement plan are (i) international competitive bidding for (a) supply \ncontracts estimated to cost above $500,000, and (b) civil works contracts \nabove $1 million; (ii) national competitive bidding for (a) works contracts \nbetween  $100,000  and  $1 million,  and  (b)  supply  of  goods  between \n$100,000  and  $500,000;  and  (iii) shopping  procedures  for  supply  of \ngoods  contracts  less  than  $100,000.  All  procurement  contracts  will \ncontain anticorruption provisions as specified by ADB. Procurement for \nworks and equipment and materials financed under the Korea Eximbank \ncofinancing will be carried out in accordance with the Korea Eximbank's \nprocurement procedures. These procedures were discussed and agreed \nwith the government and EDL. ADB shall be satisfied that the procedures \nused for the Korea Eximbank-financed procurement will be used to fulfill \nthe borrower's obligations to cause the project to be carried out diligently \nand efficiently, and that the goods and works to be procured (i) are of \nsatisfactory quality and compatible with the balance of the project; (ii) will \nbe delivered or completed in a timely fashion; and (iii) are priced so as \nnot  to  affect  adversely  the  economical  and  financial  viability  of  the \nproject. \n   \nConsulting Services  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  assist  EDL  in \nimplementing the project. The firm will be responsible for assisting the ", "  v \nproject management unit implement the whole project (both ADB and \nKorea  Eximbank  financing),  particularly  in  (i)  procuring  goods  and \nservices for the ADB-financed component; (ii) supervising construction \nand installation; (iii) completing system final testing and commissioning; \n(iv) conducting social and environmental assessment, management, and \nmonitoring; (v) strengthening EDL capacity in social and environmental \nassessment,  management,  and  monitoring;  (vi) undertaking  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation; and (vii) reporting on the project. \nThe  firm  will  provide  175  person-months  of  consulting  services  (80 \nperson-months  by  international  and  95  person-months  by  national \nexperts) following ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection (ratio 80:20) \nand using full technical proposal procedures. Advance recruitment will be \nused for the project implementation consultant. However, ADB support of \nadvance recruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to approve the \nproject nor to finance the recruitment costs. A procurement specialist will \nbe  recruited  under  Korea  Eximbank  financing  to  help  EDL  in  the \nprocurement process of Korea Eximbank-financed packages. In addition, \na senior advisor will be recruited to provide EDL and MEM with strategic \nissues related to energy sector development. All consultants under ADB \nfinancing will be selected and engaged under the project in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  significant  benefits  of  the  project  are  expansion  of  EDL's  T&D \nBeneficiaries  network and increased access of grid electricity to rural poor households \nand new businesses in the remote provinces of the Lao PDR. About \n18,800 new households, including more than 6,000 poor households in \nPhongsali and Xaignabouli provinces, will be connected to the grid. This \nis  a  very  important  condition  for  improving  living  standards  for  rural \npopulations  in  these  provinces.  Availability  of  reliable  electricity  will \nincrease income-earning opportunities for the poor and boost economic \ngrowth and social development in Xaignabouli and Phongsali provinces.  \n \nThe economic internal rate of return is evaluated at 42%. The financial \ninternal rate of return, estimated at 11.5% after tax, exceeds the weighted \naverage cost of capital (2.7%). The project will also generate moderate \nemployment during its implementation.  \n \nWith the cross-border interconnection between the Paklay substation and \nthe Thali substation, consumers in Xaignabouli province will be provided \nwith a more reliable and better quality electricity supply, and at the same \ntime, consumers in Loei Province in northern Thailand will benefit from \nhydroelectricity imported through the Thali substation. Reliability of both \nEDL and Provincial Electricity Authority systems will be improved.  \n \n  MEM is another beneficiary of the project; it will be assisted by a resident \nadvisor in making informed policy decisions on the development of the \nenergy  sector  as  a  whole,  including  power  system  development, \ntendering of IPPs, negotiation of power purchase agreements, renewable \nenergy strategy, and energy efficiency and conservation policy.  \n   \n ", "vi   \nRisks and  The project is not expected to face any significant technical risks. State of \nAssumptions  the art technology is widely available. EDL has good experience and has \nperformed well in implementing similar T&D projects. In particular, EDL \nmanagerial skill and capacity for such projects have improved through \nimplementation of the ongoing ADB-financed Northern Area Rural Power \nDistribution Project.  \n \nSmooth coordination between packages financed by the ADB grant and \nthe Korea Eximbank loan is critical to the success of the project. To \nensure  coordinated  implementation,  the  project  design  envisages \nengaging  one  project  implementation  consultant  to  help  EDL  take \nmeasures to ensure procurement is undertaken diligently and efficiently, \nand in overseeing implementation of all three project modules.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nNorthern Power Transmission Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Macroeconomic Performance \n2.  During 2001\u20132008, the Lao economy grew at an average 6.5% per annum, with highest \ngrowth of 7.9% in 2007.1 Agriculture is the largest contributor to the economy accounting for \nalmost 45% of the gross domestic product followed by industry (30%) and services (25%). \nHowever, industry is the fastest growing sector with average annual growth of more than 12%, \nwhereas services have been expanding at about 7.5% and agriculture at 3.5% per annum since \n2004.  \n \n3.  The country's 6th National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 emphasizes \neradication of poverty and accelerating the pace of socioeconomic development as the nation\u2019s \nmost important long-term strategic goals.2 It mainstreams priority sectors, including agriculture, \nhealth, education, and infrastructure. Development of these sectors will directly contribute to \nrealization of the agenda for poverty reduction: (i) expansion of economic opportunities, with an \nemphasis  on  commercial  agriculture,  rural  development,  infrastructure  development,  and \nsupport for small and medium-sized enterprises; (ii) improved provision of basic social services \nwith a focus on health, education, and clean drinking water; (iii) stronger human security, \nincluding  measures  aimed  at  fostering  food  security,  reducing  threats  from  unexploded \nordnance, and ensuring protection against natural disasters; (iv) enhanced participation by and \nempowerment of the poor; and (v) concentrated efforts to develop the poorest areas through a \nrange of targeted interventions. The 6th plan envisages an acceleration of average annual real \ngross domestic product growth to 7.5%.  \n \n4.  In the medium term, development of energy and power will be central to infrastructure \ndevelopment in the country. Power infrastructure development will (i) ensure the supply of \naffordable  electricity\u2014a  basic  need\u2014for  the  entire  population;  and  (ii)  create  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  (a)  significantly  improving  living  conditions,  (b)  generating  incomes,  and  \n(c) continuing economic growth. \n \n2.  Power System Performance \n \n5.  The power system serves two vital purposes: (i) providing electricity to meet increasing \ndomestic  demand;  and  (ii)  earning  hard  currency  revenues  by  exporting  electricity  to \nneighboring  countries.  Electricite  du  Laos  (EDL)\u2014a  state-owned  utility\u2014is  responsible  for \nsupplying electricity for consumers in the country. Currently, EDL-installed generating capacity \ntotals 330 megawatts (MW) (98% hydro-based capacity and 2% small diesel-based capacity). \n                                                \n1  The government recognizes that gross domestic product this year will slow to 5% due to the global economic crisis. \n2  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Committee for Planning and Investment. 2006. National \nSocio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010). Vientiane. ", "2   \nSeveral of EDL's large hydropower plants (HPPs) are Nam Ngum 1 HPP (150 MW), Nam Leuk \nHPP (60 MW), Xeset 1 HPP (45 MW), and Nam Mang 3 HPP (40 MW). Three HPPs are \npresently under construction for domestic supply: Nam Lik 1/2 HPP (120 MW), Nam Ngum 5 \nHPP (120 MW), and Xeset 2 HPP (76 MW). \n \n6.  In addition to facilities owned by EDL for domestic supply, several independent power \nproducers (IPPs) export electricity to Thailand, such as Theun Hinboun (210 MW, EDL share \n60%) commissioned in 1998 and Houay Ho (150 MW, EDL share 20%) commissioned in 1999. \nBy the end of 2008, total IPP installed generating capacity was 360 MW. Thus, the whole \ncountry has a total of 690 MW.  \n \n7.  The country's generating capacity is mostly hydro based. This is to make use of the \nhuge  hydropower  potential,  which  is  estimated  at  18,000  MW.  To  date,  only  about  3.3% \n(690 MW) of this potential has been developed serving the Lao grid and for export to Thailand. \nA further 2,250 MW of capacity is in various stages of development. The Lao PDR has signed \nmemorandums of understanding for exporting 3,000 MW of power to Viet Nam and 5,000 MW \nto Thailand. \n \n8.  EDL's transmission and distribution (T&D) system is fragmented; it has three separate \n115 kilovolt (kV) transmission subsystems. The Nam Ngum 1\u2013Nam Leuk\u2013Nam Mang 3 115 kV \nsystem serves Vientiane capital, Louangphrabang, Xiangkhouang, Xaignabouli, and provinces \nin the central region. The Khammoune 115 kV system imports power from Nakhon Phanom in \nThailand via Thakhek's 115/22 kV substation to supply Thakhek and its surrounding areas. \nSavannakhet's 115 kV system imports power from Thailand to supply Savannakhet province. \n \n9.  From 2000 to 2008, domestic demand for electricity increased at an average 14% per \nyear with higher year-on-year growth at the end of the period. This demand increase is being \nmet by a corresponding increase in electricity production (6%) and increase in electricity imports \n(11%).3 The  central  region  around  Vientiane  accounted  for  almost  90%  of  total  electricity \nconsumption. The southern and northern regions account for the remaining 10% as these \nregions are poor.  \n \n10.  Because of EDL system expansion and increased capacity, household electrification \nserved by the EDL grid has grown steadily from 19% in 1996 to 58% in 2008. Similar to \nconsumption patterns, electrification is higher in the central region, whereas the northern region \nhas the lowest rate (13% in Phongsali province compared with the 58% national average).  \n \n11.  The Power Development Plan for 2007\u20132016 envisages a fourfold increase in electricity \ndemand  from  350  MW  in  2006  to  1,216  MW  in  2015.  Correspondingly,  annual  electricity \nconsumption will grow from 1,700 gigawatt-hours (GWh) to 7,000 GWh. To meet this demand, \ntimely development of the Lao power system must be ensured, both in generation and the \ntransmission and distribution (T&D) network. \n \n12.  In  the  past,  EDL's  retail  tariff  has  been  low  and  included  cross-subsidies  by \nnonresidential customers to residential customers and agriculture. Since 2005, the government \nand EDL have implemented a tariff adjustment program to remove these subsidies. This tariff \nadjustment program coupled with the program that settles government arrears resulted in an \n                                                \n3  In 2008, the Lao PDR imported a total of 510 GWh to supply 11 provinces. The largest import was from Thailand \n(470 GWh) to supply seven provinces including Xaignabouli, followed by imports from Viet Nam (22.6 GWh) for \nthree provinces in northeast and 17.8 GWh from the People's Republic of China for Phongsali province. ", "      3 \nimproved financial situation for EDL in 2008. In 2008, the EDL average sale price (KN542 per \nkilowatt-hour [kWh]) covered its production cost (KN468/kWh). \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints  \n13.  The  power  system  is  at  a  nascent  stage  of  development,  characterized  by  small \ngenerating capacity and fragmented T&D systems. Presently, EDL's T&D systems do not cover \nthe entire country. For example, Phongsali province and a large part of Xaignabouli province are \nnot covered by EDL's T&D system. The absence of a strong and reliable T&D system in the \ncountry necessitates the import of expensive electricity at 22 kV. At this low voltage, imported \nelectricity is more expensive ($0.08/kWh) than EDL's supply ($0.05/kWh\u2013$0.06/kWh). To deal \nwith  this  problem,  the  Lao  government  plans  to  phase  out  the  import  of  medium  voltage \nelectricity by 2015 by building up its national high voltage grid system and exchanging high \nvoltage  power  (e.g.,  115  kV  and  above)  with  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  The  115  kV \ninterconnection proposed in this project is to meet this government objective. \n \n14.  Because of the lack of a unified T&D network, electrification in the Lao PDR is among \nthe lowest of the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In the project \narea, rural electrification is particularly low in Phongsali province (13%). Xaignabouli province, \ndue  to  its  relative  vicinity  to  Vientiane  and  increasing  trade  with  Thailand,  has  a  higher \nelectrification rate (50%) but it is still below the national average (58%). Poverty is widespread \nwhere electricity is not made available to households. For example, in Phongsali province, 60% \nof households are considered poor4 according to the government's statistics, while in some \ndistricts of Xaignabouli province, the percentage of poor households is as high as 50%. \n \n15.  Lack  of  institutional  capacity  represents  a  key  constraint  in  managing  sustainable \ndevelopment of the country's huge hydro resource for domestic and export use. The balancing \nof  these  two  objectives  requires  proper  long-term  planning.  In  addition,  potential  negative \nimpacts on the environment and communities living in the river basins require a systemic \napproach  in  planning  and  implementing  mitigation  measures,  livelihood  development,  and \nenvironmental conservation programs for which the need for capacity building is urgent. \n \n16.  EDL's financial robustness depends on its ability to generate sufficient capital to cover \noperating expenses and future investment. EDL's investment requirement for 2007\u20132016 is \nestimated at $1.3 billion. This requires an electricity tariff that meets the system\u2019s marginal \nproduction costs. In the future, to meet the estimated investment requirements and to maintain \nEDL's financial sustainability, the government and EDL will need to continue the tariff reform \nprogram that will apply time-of-use rates distinguished by voltage for customers. Such a tariff \nwill align with the supply costs, and ensure financial and economic efficiencies. An independent \nregulatory agency is necessary to manage the tariff regulation. The absence of such an agency \nputs a burden on the government and makes the tariff adjustment time consuming. An authority \nto manage the tendering of hydro IPPs is also needed. \n \n                                                \n4  According to the government's definition, households considered poor are those with an income of less than \nKN85,000 equivalent in cash per person/month (based on 2001 prices). This sum allows purchasing 16 kilograms \nof milled rice per person/month, but the balance is insufficient to cover other necessary expenses, such as clothing, \nshelter, children\u2019s schooling costs, and medical treatment. According to the latest survey carried out by the National \nCommittee on Rural Development and Poverty Reduction, 1.5 million of the population are poor, representing 27% \nof the country\u2019s population.  \n ", "4   \n2.  Opportunities \n17.  Improving access to electricity and rural electrification targets. Recognizing the \nimportance of the provision of electricity for reducing poverty and improving living conditions, the \ngovernment  has  specific  plans  to  provide  electricity  from  the  national  grid  to  70%  of  all \nhouseholds in the country by 2010, 80% by 2015, and 90% by 2020. For the provinces under \nthe project, these national targets mean an increase of the household electrification rate from \n13% to 28% in Phongsali province and from 50% to 98% in Xaignabouli province. The other \nnorthern provinces will also have to increase their electrification rates accordingly from 33% to \n79% in Louang-Namtha province, and from 41% to 90% in Bokeo province.  \n \n18.  Meeting  increasing  demand  with  grid  extension. To achieve the ambitious rural \nelectrification targets requires an expansion of EDL's T&D network.5 The government and EDL \nplace great emphasis on building a unified national T&D grid with assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  Japan,  the  World  Bank,  other  development  partners,  and \ninternational private investors. \n \n19.  Sustainable hydropower development. Development of large hydropower projects will \ncontinue to play an important role in meeting domestic demand as well as for export. The \nrevenues generated from increased export earnings will be vital to improving basic government \nservices, including education, health, and infrastructure services in poor areas of the country. \nThe  government  can  obtain  benefits  from  hydropower  projects  through  concession  fees, \nroyalties, taxation, and returns on its equity stake in particular projects. The government\u2019s \nHydropower  Sustainable  Development  Policy  provides  guidance  for  exploration  of  national \nresources  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Currently,  the  Water  Resource  and  Environment \nAdministration is responsible for implementation of environmental protection policies and social \nresettlement policies. It has asked ADB to help build capacity to meet this challenge. \n \n20.  Private sector participation. Private sector participation in power development will be \nneeded especially because the government expects half of the investment requirements to be \nsecured from the private sector, particularly for power generation. The government is working to \ncreate a favorable investment environment for the private sector by defining appropriate roles \nfor  the  public  and  private  sectors,  establishing  institutions  to  facilitate  IPP  participation, \nintroducing a transparent bidding mechanism, and adopting best practices for formulating power \npurchase agreements. The government is also taking steps to put in place an appropriate \nregulatory framework to  encourage  private  sector  participation. The  Department  of  Energy \nDevelopment  and  Promotion  has  requested  ADB  assistance  to  enhance  its  capacity  for \nmanaging IPP projects. \n \n21.  Long tradition of power exchange with Thailand. The Lao PDR has a long tradition \nand good experience in exchanging power with Thailand. The Lao PDR exports to Thailand \npower generated from its large HPPs at 220 kV such as Theun Hinboun and Houay Ho, and \nfrom Nam Ngum 1 at 115 kV, and it imports power from Thailand at 115 kV and 22 kV. The \ncountries have five operating interconnections at 115 kV and five at 22 kV.  \n \n22.  Currently, a 22 kV transmission line connects the Thali substation (in Loei province of \nThailand) with Paklay district in Xaignabouli province. This 22 kV transmission line now provides \n                                                \n5  The electrification of households in Vientiane which has a 115 kV network linking generation sources with demand \ncenter, was 96% (2007) compared to 13% in Phongsali province which does not have access to the transmission \nnetwork. The project will construct almost 398 km of 115 kV line, this is a significant addition to the network given \nthat the total length of the central backbone 115 kV system was 1,498 km in 2007. ", "      5 \nimported  electricity  to  Xaignabouli  province.  Once  the  project's  115  kV  cross-border \ninterconnection is built, it will replace the current 22 kV transmission line used for power import. \nThe 115 kV cross-border interconnection will have a much higher load-carrying capacity and \nlower voltage drop; hence, it will deliver more reliable and improved quality of electricity supply. \nUnlike the existing 22 kV transmission line, which is used only for importing power, the 115 kV \ninterconnection can be utilized for both import and export of electricity. Such two-way power \ntrade will be possible and beneficial to the Lao PDR and Thailand by making use of the \nseasonal variation of hydro energy.6 In addition, the interconnection allows the two systems to \nback each other up during line maintenance and power outages. \n \n23.  Both  governments,  EDL,  and  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT) \nstrongly support the cross-border connection under the project. On 13 May 2009, the EGAT \ngovernor and the EDL managing director general signed a memorandum of understanding in \nBangkok officially announcing the agreement for the proposed interconnection. Two countries \nhave joint operation committees supervising power exchange between EGAT and EDL. The \ncommittees meet regularly, involving technical and senior staff, to discuss cooperation. The \ninterconnection under this project will be part of the current Nam Ngum 1 system. Thus, the \narrangement for power buying and selling will be looked at by the joint committees as an \nintegral part of the Nam Ngum 1 system interconnection with EGAT.  \n \n24.  The interconnection line to be built under the project and the ongoing Northern GMS \nTransport Network Improvement Project to improve the roads from the Lao PDR\u2013Thailand \nborder along Xaignabouli province and northward to Louangphrabang will accelerate economic \ncooperation  activities  and  cross-border  trade  between  northeast  Thailand  and  Xaignabouli \nprovince. According to the National Economic Development Board of Thailand, this corridor is a \npriority area for Thailand official development assistance to the Lao PDR because of the strong \ninterest of Thailand\u2019s private sector in commercial agriculture development. Availability of a \nreliable supply of electricity is essential for business in the project area. \n \n25.  The project area has large hydropower potential. Two HPPs totaling 240 MW mainly for \ndomestic supply are under construction (Nam Lik1/2 and Nam Ngum 5 HPPs), and several \nother HPPs have been identified for development in the coming years to supply electricity \ndirectly into EDL's transmission network. The Nam Tha 1 HPP (168 MW) is to be built in \nLouang-Namtha  province,  and the  electricity generated  can  be  transmitted to  the  Louang-\nNamtha substation (built under an ADB loan).7 The Nam Ham HPP (5 MW) is near Paklay town \nand its power will be transmitted to the Paklay substation under this project. Similarly, the Nam \nOu HPP (50 MW) in Phongsali province will be connected to the Namo substation. With the \ndevelopment of generation in synchronization with the T&D network expansion, EDL's system \nwill be significantly strengthened and the Lao PDR will greatly benefit from using its own hydro \nresources for socioeconomic development and poverty reduction.  \n \n26.  The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) is mandated to provide the policy framework \nand strategic vision for long-term development of the energy sector in the Lao PDR. The sector \nis facing tremendous challenges, for example, optimal utilization of the country\u2019s abundant \nhydro resources, and balancing between domestic use of electricity and demand for export. The \nproject will provide a senior policy advisor to advise EDL and MEM on strategic policy issues \n                                                \n6  Similarly,  with  the  interconnection  between  Huyaxay  and  Xiangkhouang  to  be  constructed  and  with  the \ntransmission line between Namo and Boun Nua to be constructed under this project, two-way power trade at 115 \nkV will be possible. \n7  ADB. 2003.

Manila (Loan 2005-LAO). \n ", "6   \nrelated  to  energy  sector  development.  These  include  (i)  power  system  development,  \n(ii) development of large IPP HPPs, (iii) development of a transmission company in charge of \nthe high voltage transmission system, (iv) tendering of IPPs, (v) negotiation of power purchase \nagreements, and (vi) synchronization between hydropower development and environmental \nprotection.   \n  \n3.  Government Strategy   \n27.  The Lao Power Sector Strategy (2002) identifies the main pillars for power system \ndevelopment, including (i) maintaining and expanding an affordable, reliable, and sustainable \nelectricity supply in the Lao PDR to promote economic and social development; (ii) promoting \npower generation for export; (iii) developing and enhancing the legal and regulatory framework \nto effectively direct and facilitate power system development; and (iv) reforming institutions and \ninstitutional  structures  to  clarify  responsibilities,  strengthen  commercial  functions,  and \nstreamline administration.  \n \n28.  Between 1995 and 2008, the government increased household connections from 16% to \n58%. The government's goal is to achieve supply of 90% of households with electricity by 2020 \n(70% of households by 2010, 80% by 2015). As this target is being achieved, electrification \nmoves increasingly to remote areas and the remaining villages and households in rural areas. \nEDL's  development  plan  calls  for  expansion  and  strengthening  of  the  T&D  system  with \nemphasis on (i) increasing the length of new transmission systems, (ii) building new substations \nand  expanding  existing  substations,  (iii)  developing  high-voltage  interconnections  with \nneighboring  countries,  (iv)  overhauling  and  reinforcing  the  distribution  network,  and  \n(v) developing national and regional dispatch centers. According to the Power Development \nPlan  (para.  11),  the  project  components  constitute  a  noticeable  part  of  the  planned  T&D \nexpansion during 2011\u20132016.8  \n \n4.  ADB Sector Strategy \n29.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for the Lao PDR aims to promote sustainable \neconomic development through infrastructure investments. For power, the country strategy and \nprogram  emphasizes  the  importance  of  helping  the  country  build  and  expand  its  power \ninfrastructure  in  a  sustainable  manner  and  build  human  resource  capacity  for  efficient \nmanagement of energy and power development.9  \n \n30.  The Lao energy sector strategy study (Appendix 2) identifies several key areas that \nwould benefit from ADB assistance: (i) improving access to electricity; (ii) strengthening T&D \nsystems through network integration; (iii) maximizing the benefits of hydropower; (iv) promoting \nrenewable energy, and energy efficiency and conservation; and (v) building capacity for energy \npolicy planning and formulation including energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies.  \n \n31.  Improving  access  to  electricity.  More rural electrification projects will need to be \nimplemented to achieve the government\u2019s rural electrification targets. ADB will continue to \nprovide loan and grant assistance to future rural electrification projects, both on-grid and off-\ngrid.  ADB\u2019s  focus  will  continue  to  be  on  the  northern  region,  because  of  its  very  low \nelectrification rates. EDL estimates that about 46,000 new connections will be required during \n                                                \n8  All project components are included in the Power Development Plan 2007\u20132016, including the interconnection with \nThailand at the border near Kenethao in Xaignabouli province. \n9  ADB. 2009.

No  other  development  agencies  are  making  major  investments  for  rural \nelectrification in the northern region. \n \n32.  Strengthening the T&D system. Intra- and interregional transmission development is \nkey  to  meeting  the  country\u2019s  demand  for  hydropower  resources.  ADB  will  assist  EDL  in \ndeveloping its network to (i) provide hydropower from EDL or domestic IPPs to the EDL grid,  \n(ii) enable EDL to fully use its entitlement from export projects (existing and new), and (iii) serve \ncustomers in urban and remote areas. \n \n33.  Maximizing the benefits of hydropower exports. ADB support will focus on creating \nan enabling environment for investors to continue with the development of hydropower and \nother resources for exports, while ensuring that the benefits to the Lao PDR and its institutions \nare maximized. In this respect, ADB will support (i) developing transmission interconnections to \nserve the 10% entitlement of export projects to EDL customers, and (ii) enabling EDL customers \nand the network to be interlinked to the transmission line serving export customers to ensure \nmaximum benefits of such infrastructure to the country. \n \n34.  Promoting investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. ADB support \nwill build MEM capacity to promote renewable energy development and implementation of \nenergy  efficiency.  Specific  areas  of  assistance  to  promote  use  of  renewable  energy  are  \n(i) development of a renewable energy strategy and action plan, and (ii) investment support for \non-  and  off-grid  small  and  mini-hydropower.  Specific  areas  of  support  to  promote  energy \nefficiency and conservation are development of (i) an energy efficiency strategy and action plan, \n(ii) energy efficiency in government buildings (to complement World Bank capacity building work \nand sample audits), (iii) capacity to conduct energy audits and formulate projects for energy \n \nefficiency standards and labeling, and (iv) legislation to promote energy efficiency.\n \n5.  External Assistance  \n35.  ADB, with its support for various transmission and hydropower projects, is the largest \nsource of development assistance to the power system: about $323 million in loans and grants \nand $17 million in technical assistance (TA) since the early 1970s. TA projects focused on the \ndevelopment of HPPs, power system strategy, power planning, and rural electrification. Loans \nand grants were provided to develop hydropower and T&D systems. Given that hydropower is a \nvital resource that can serve domestic need as well as generate revenues of hard currency, \nADB assistance has enabled the Lao PDR to harness this important renewable energy resource \nboth for domestic use and for exports. ADB assistance also facilitated strengthening the T&D \nnetwork and interconnection with neighboring countries.  \n \n36.  The World Bank has also provided TA and loans and grants targeting the development \nof hydropower, rural electrification, and institution building. The two latest World Bank power \nprojects (i) the Rural Electrification Project, phase 1, approved in March 2006 and (ii) the GMS \nPower Trade Project approved in May 2008. Apart from T&D system development, these World \nBank projects help EDL build national dispatching center in Vientiane and regional dispatching \ncenters in provinces. A tariff study will be implemented under the GMS Power Trade Project. \nOther multinational and bilateral agencies involved in the power system are Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  Nordic  Development  Fund,  and  Danish  International  Development \nAgency. Development partner coordination is described in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "8   \n37.  Donor coordination in the GMS power sector is enhanced through the Regional Power \nTrade Coordinating Committee that meets once a year and through the Planning Working \nGroup that meets three to four times a year to discuss regional power master plans and to \nprioritize cross border power interconnections. The World Bank, Japan, Agence Francaise de \nDeveloppement (AFD), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and \nMekong River Commission participate in these meetings that are coordinated by ADB. \n \n6.  Lessons  \n38.  Project performance audit reports rate the Nam Leuk HPP project, Theun Hinboun HPP \nproject,  and  Nam  Ngum\u2013Louangphrabang  Prabang  transmission  project  successful.  The \nperformance evaluation of past ADB transmission projects identifies several important lessons, \nsuch as (i) transmission projects that traverse populated rural areas should provide for the \ndistribution  of  electricity  to  such  areas  and  thereby  minimize  objections  and  enhance  the \nsocioeconomic impact; (ii) feasibility estimates that are dependent on detailed engineering after \nloan  approval  should  include  a  wider  contingency  margin  to  avoid  the  possible  need  for \nsupplementary financing and delays; (iii) nonuniform design considerations, including provision \nfor variable tower heights, tower spans, and tower support structures, should be applied to \ntransmission  projects  for  provinces  with  mountainous  topography;  (iv)  EDL  staff  and \nimplementation consultants should become more familiar with ADB procurement procedures; \n(v) financial loan covenants for EDL should be set realistically; and (vi) the average cost of \nconnection to the electric system for rural households should be kept at a reasonable amount.  \n \n39.  These lessons were incorporated in the project design. In fact, this project builds not \nonly transmission lines but more importantly substations and associated distribution networks \nthat bring electricity to villages and households. To help poor households overcome connection \nfee  barriers,  the  project  includes  a  provision  to  provide  no-interest  credit  for  connections. \nPhysical contingencies are at 11%, and topography of the project area is taken into account in \nthe technical design. Regarding the financial covenant, the ADB mission reached an agreement \nwith the World Bank that both institutions will apply similar financial covenant ratios for all \nprojects to be approved by ADB and the World Bank starting in 2009. Other lessons identified \nthrough consultation with EDL and MEM were also incorporated in the project. For example, \none lesson is that substations and transmission lines must be bundled into a single contract \npackage to achieve synchronous completion for energizing. The approval process developed for \nthe resettlement plan by the Department of Electricity and Water Resources and Environment \nAdministration will reduce the time required for approvals.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n40.  The project10 will extend EDL\u2019s T&D system to Phongsali and Xaignabouli provinces, \nand  the  western  part  of  Vientiane  province.  It  will  link  with  the  EGAT  system  to  provide \nelectricity  in  an  efficient  and  reliable  manner  to  rural  villages,  towns,  and  industrial  and \ncommercial consumers that do not have access to electricity supply or rely on limited high-cost, \noff-grid power supplies. The project will directly contribute to achievement of the government's \ngoal of electrifying 90% of the country\u2019s households by 2020. The household electrification rate \n                                                \n10 The project preparatory TA was completed in December 2008. ADB. 2006.

", "      9 \nin the main project area (Phongsali and Xaignabouli provinces) will increase from 39% (2009) to \n79% by 2020.  \n \n41.  The  project  outcome  will  be  increased  access  to  electricity  by  households,  small \nbusinesses, and commercial and industrial customers. Increased access is being enabled by  \n(i) new 115 kV transmission lines with associated substations and interconnection with the \nEGAT\u2013Provincial  Electricity  Authority  system;  and  (ii)  extended  medium-  and  low-voltage \ndistribution systems. About 18,800 new households (6,000 poor households) in the project area \nwill  be  connected  to the  national  grid. Given  the  current  absence  of a  nationwide  unified \ntransmission system, this project, in addition to the ongoing ADB-supported project (footnote 7), \nhelps to construct a national transmission network covering the whole country. \n \nB.  Outputs \n42.  The project will construct several 115 kV transmission lines, substations, and medium-\nand low-voltage distribution networks. The project will also increase the two-way transfer of \npower between EDL and EGAT's grids.

Exact lengths will be confirmed during project implementation. \n ", "10   \n(2)  Namo 115 kV switching station \n(c)  Associated medium- and low-voltage distribution\u2014361 km 22 kV feeders \nfrom Boun Nua substation \n(d)  2,645 households supplied from Boun Nua substation  \n \n43.  The  project's  low-voltage  distribution  networks  include  low-voltage  lines,  step-down \ntransformers, and connection to electric poles adjacent to households. For poor households, the \nproject provides a free meter of 3/9 ampere. To help poor households finance the connection, \nthe project design includes a credit scheme that will provide no-interest credit of KN700,000 to \neach eligible poor household so that they can pay for the wiring from the poles to their houses \nand wiring inside the houses. The credit to the poor scheme works as follows: the district \nauthorities will be responsible for identifying households eligible for receiving no-interest credit \nof up to KN700,000. Once certified by the district authorities, the households will sign an \nagreement with EDL provincial offices for accepting the credit and committing to repay EDL \nKN20,000  together  with  the  monthly  electricity  bill.  Payment  will  continue  for  35  months. \nHouseholds  will  also  sign  an  agreement  with  their  chosen  local  contractors  based  on  a \npredetermined form for wiring their houses. Upon certification of these contracts, EDL will use \nthe credit fund to pay contractors. This credit scheme was successfully implemented by the \nWorld Bank's Rural Electrification Project, phase 1, power to the poor component implemented \nin seven southern provinces of the Lao PDR. To date, 3,500 households have received credit \nand have their houses connected. This credit scheme has been well received and appreciated \nby the population. Based on provincial statistics, more than 6,000 poor households in Phongsali \nand Xaignabouli provinces will benefit from this assistance under this project. \n \n44.  Based on the government\u2019s request, the project will provide a senior policy advisor to \nadvise on strategic policy issues related to long-term energy sector development, such as the \npower development plan, tendering of large hydro IPPs, and negotiation of power purchase \nagreements. The senior policy advisor will also assist in drafting of a strategy framework on \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy. \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Link with Greater Mekong Subregion Power Trading \n45.  Currently under the coordination of the Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee, \nan institutional framework for power trade among the GMS countries is being developed. To \ndevelop the grid connection infrastructure, the GMS power master plan is being updated to \nidentify the most viable cross-border interconnections. With significant hydro resources and \nsituated in the center of GMS, the Lao PDR can play an important role in GMS power trade \ndevelopment. One of the project outputs is the 115 kV line connecting Paklay substation in the \nLao PDR with Thali substation in Thailand. The project will promote power trade between EDL \nand EGAT, especially in the long term when more hydro capacity will be constructed in the Lao \nPDR and also as demand grows on both sides of the border. The project is part of a wider \nexpansion  of  a  Lao  PDR\u2013Thailand  interconnection  plan  developed  in  EDL's  Power \nDevelopment Plan 2007\u20132016. By 2015, two 115 kV interconnections will be developed in the \nnorthern region: Paklay\u2013Thali (proposed in this project) and Huyaxay\u2013Xiangkhouang.  \n \n2.  Partnership in Project Financing  \n46.  ADB and the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) of Korea Eximbank will \nfinance the project. By mobilizing funds from Korea Eximbank, in addition to ADB's Asian ", "      11 \nDevelopment Fund, the construction of about 400 km of transmission lines and associated \nsubstations, and a vast medium- and low-voltage distribution system can be implemented in a \nshort time frame.  \n \n3.  Connections for Poor Households   \n47.  To support the poor, the project design includes distribution equipment up to the poles \nand inclusive of the meter of 3/9 ampere for poor households. The project will also allocate \n$750,000 for the Credit to the Poor Fund, which was successfully implemented in the southern \nprovinces. The project is replicating this scheme with more than 6,000 poor households. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n48.  The  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $65.32  million,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation \n(Table 1).  \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem     Amount \nA.

Financing Plan \n49.  The  government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $20  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to help finance the project (module 1, credit for poor households, and advisory \nservices). The government has also asked Korea Eximbank to provide $37,880,000 from the \nEDCF to help finance the project (modules 2 and 3). EDL will finance $7,440,000 to cover land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  during  construction \n($1,850,000). Table 2 shows the financing plan. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 4. The government will relend the ADB grant and the Korea Eximbank loan to EDL \nthrough subsidiary loan agreements. The terms and conditions for subsidiary loans will be \ndetermined jointly by EDL, MEM, and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) subject to government \napproval. Based on past projects, the relending interest for a subsidiary loan is usually 4%\u20137%, \nand maturity is 10\u201320 years with a grace period of 3\u20135 years. \n \n50.  The Government of the Republic of Korea, through Korea Eximbank, will provide loan \ncofinancing equivalent to $37,880,000. Korea Eximbank cofinancing will be parallel and tied, \nand denominated in won. The loan has interest of 0.01% per annum, with 40-year maturity and \na 15-year grace period. The Korea Eximbank loan will be effective upon ADB approval of the \nproject.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank   20.00  30.6 \nGovernment of the Republic of Koreaa  37.88  58.0 \nElectricite du Laos  7.44  11.4 \n  Total    65.32  100.0 \na Through Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n51.  EDL will be the executing agency for all three modules of the project financed by ADB \nand Korea Eximbank. The project management unit (PMU) currently implementing the ADB loan \n(footnote 7) will serve as the implementing agency. The PMU will implement the project with \nassistance from EDL\u2019s provincial branch offices in the project areas. An international consulting \nfirm serving as the project implementation consultant (PIC) will be engaged to help the PMU \nwith project implementation for all three modules. Figure 1 shows the organization structure. \n ", "      13 \nFigure 1: Project Management Organization \n \n \nDistrict Compensation and \n                EDL \nGrievance Committees  \n \n \nPMU \nEDL Branches  PIC \n \nContractors \n \n   \nEDL = Electricite du Laos, PIC = project implementation consultant, PMU = project management unit. \nSources: EDL and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n52.  The PMU will be responsible for (i) overall project implementation planning, budgeting, \nfinance planning, and accounting; (ii) consultant recruitment; (iii) supervision and coordination of \ndetailed project design; (iv) procurement of goods and services; (v) implementation, supervision, \nand commissioning of all project components including administration of the no-interest credit \nscheme to poor households; (vi) implementation of environmental impact mitigation measures \nand resettlement plans; (vii) organization of the project performance monitoring system; and \n(viii) preparation of periodic project progress reports and project completion report. \n \n53.  The EDL provincial branch in each province will appoint staff to assist the PMU in \nimplementing  the  project.  They  will  be  responsible  for  local  liaison  and  coordination  with \ncontractors,  processing  household  connections,  local  site  supervision,  and  supervision  of \nproject construction and commissioning. They will update all data relating to project progress \nmonitoring, contractor performance, and financial reports.  \n \n54.  District  and  provincial  authorities  will  provide  assistance  to  the  project  in  various \nresettlement  planning  and  implementation  activities.  This  support  will  be  utilized  to  form \ncompensation  and  grievance  committees,  which  will  comprise  representatives  from  EDL, \nprovincial MEM departments, provincial cabinets, provincial water resources and environment \nadministrations, and provincial land offices. The committees will be responsible for planning and \nimplementing compensation and resettlement in accordance with the resettlement plan.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n55.  The project will be implemented over 42 months13 from the effectiveness of the grant. \nAdvance  recruitment  of  the  PIC  was  requested  to  ensure  timely  project  implementation. \nHowever, ADB approval of the advance recruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to \napprove the project or to finance the recruitment costs. The detailed implementation schedule is \nin Appendix 5.  \n                                                \n13  The 42-month implementation schedule was a result of concrete discussion with the PMU. In the past a major \nreason for longer implementation was approval of resettlement plans and particularly compensation rates. ADB \nand the PMU agreed that the PMU will prepare an updated resettlement plan to avoid delays. In addition, turnkey \ncontracts will be used for the construction, which will save time. \n ", "14   \n \n3.  Procurement \n56.  All  grant-financed  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan \nprepared and agreed to by the government and ADB. The ADB-financed turnkey contract will \nfollow  international  competitive  bidding  with  prequalification  and  follow  the  one-stage  two-\nenvelope procurement method. All procurement contracts will contain anticorruption provisions \nas specified by ADB.  \n \n57.  Procurement for modules 2 and 3 to be financed under the Korea Eximbank cofinancing \nwill be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under the EDCF Loan. \nSupply of goods and services under the Korea Eximbank financing will be procured from among \nRepublic of Korea firms using the one-stage two-envelope procedure. These procedures were \ndiscussed and agreed to by Korea Eximbank and the government. Packages under the Korea \nEximbank financing include (i) a contract for a procurement specialist and (ii) a turnkey contract \nfor modules 2 and 3. ADB shall be satisfied that the procedures used for the Korea Eximbank-\nfinanced procurement will fulfill the borrower's obligations to cause the project to be carried out \ndiligently and efficiently, and that the goods and works to be procured (i) are of satisfactory \nquality and compatible with the balance of the project; (ii) will be delivered or completed in a \ntimely fashion; and (iii) are priced so as not to affect adversely the economic and financial \nviability of the project. Appendix 6 shows the procurement plan for modules 1, 2, and 3.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n58.  ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) will \nbe applicable throughout the consulting services. An international consulting firm to serve as the \nPIC will be engaged to help EDL implement the entire project, in particular in (i) procuring goods \nand services; (ii) supervising construction and installation; (iii) conducting system final testing \nand commissioning; (iv) conducting social and environmental assessment, management, and \nmonitoring;  (v)  strengthening  EDL  capacity  for  social  and  environmental  assessment, \nmanagement, and monitoring; (vi) undertaking project performance monitoring and evaluation; \nand (vii) project reporting. The firm will be hired to deliver 175 person-months of consulting \nservices  (80  person-months  by  international  and  95  person-months  by  national  experts) \nfollowing ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection (80:20) procedures using the full technical \nproposal. The outline terms of reference for the PIC are in Supplementary Appendix A. In \naddition to the PIC, the project will recruit a Republic of Korea procurement expert to assist EDL \nprepare part of the bidding documents, in particular the invitation for bids (as part of the ADB \nstandard bidding document) and contract documents following Korea Eximbank procurement \nguidelines, evaluation of bidding proposals, and other technical supports related to the bidding \nprocess for procurement for modules 2 and 3. The cost of this consultant is included in Korea \nEximbank financing.  \n \n59.  A  senior  international  energy  policy  advisor  will  be  engaged  using  single-source \nselection to provide advice on strategic policy issues related to energy sector development in \nthe  Lao  PDR,  e.g.,  power  system  strategy,  development  of  large  IPP  hydropower  plants, \ntendering of IPPs, and negotiations of power purchase agreements. The indicative terms of \nreference for the senior advisor are in Supplementary Appendix B. All consultants under the \nADB financing will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n  ", "      15 \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n60.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  EDL.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. EDL will publish on its \nwebsite for each contract the following information: participating bidders, name of wining bidder. \nThe EDL legal department will closely supervise the bidding and bid evaluation processes. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n61.  Disbursement  will  be  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed to by the government and ADB. \nDisbursement will be for consulting services (inclusive of the senior advisor), and for supply and \ninstallation  of  power  transmission  and  distribution  equipment  and  accessories  (inclusive  of \nwiring  for  poor  households).  Disbursement  of  the  EDCF  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  in \naccordance with the disbursement procedures to be constituted as an integral part of the loan \nagreement between the government and Korea Eximbank. \n \n62.  Two imprest accounts will be established to provide credit to poor households for their \nconnections. According to the government requirement, a first generation imprest account will \nbe created at Bank of the Lao PDR owned by MOF, to receive the ADB funds. A second \ngeneration imprest account will be opened at Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Laos owned \nby EDL for receiving funds from MOF. EDL, with MOF authorization, will request advance and \nreplenishment of the imprest accounts. The advance and replenishment will be no more than a \n6-month  projected  disbursement  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  account  or  $250,000, \nwhichever is lower. EDL's provincial branches in Xaignabouli and Phongsali provinces have \nworked with the district authorities to identify eligible poor households to receive the credit. The \npoor households will enter into an agreement with EDL for the credit, and an agreement with a \nlocal contractor for wiring the houses. EDL will use the funds in the second generation imprest \naccount to pay the contractors the expenditures incurred for wiring the poor households. ADB's \nstatement-of-expenditure procedure will be followed when liquidating all individual payments not \nexceeding $25,000. MOF assures that it will facilitate fast-track channeling of the funds from the \nfirst to the second generation imprest accounts during project implementation. The fund flow is \nshown in Appendix 7.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n63.  EDL will maintain a separate account exclusively for project-related disbursements. The \nPMU  will  consolidate  the  account  and  have  it audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound \nauditing practices by the government\u2019s sovereign audit agency or other auditors acceptable to \nADB. The audit report will include audited financial statements and detail fund sources and \nexpenditures. Copies of the audited accounts and auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB and \nKorea Eximbank within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. A separate audit opinion will \nbe issued on the use of the imprest account and statement-of-expenditure procedures. The \ngovernment will maintain separate records and account for each of the ADB grant fund imprest \n ", "16   \naccounts, have such records and accounts appropriately audited, and regularly submit the \naudits to ADB.  \n \n64.  The PMU will prepare and submit quarterly project reports to ADB and Korea Eximbank. \nThe  reports  will  describe  the  physical  progress  for  the  reporting  period,  procurement  and \ncontractual status, highlights of implementation issues including changes to the implementation \nschedule, total number of consumers connected, and a summary of project components, with \ndetails of the latest project disbursements of incremental expenditures and contract amounts. \nThe reports will also describe the works to be carried out in the next quarterly reporting period. \nEDL will submit to ADB and Korea Eximbank a project completion report within 6 months after \nproject  completion.  Aside  from  assessing  project  execution  and  operation,  the  quarterly \nprogress reports and the completion report will indicate compliance with the grant covenants. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n65.  EDL will ensure that a comprehensive program for project performance monitoring and \nevaluation (PPME) acceptable to ADB will be carried out during implementation and subsequent \noperation to assess the achievement of the project\u2019s objectives. With help from the consultants \nand in consultation with local communities, the PMU will develop a set of PPME indicators at the \nstart of the project. The PMU will be responsible for implementing the PPME. EDL will submit a \ndetailed PPME implementation plan for ADB review and concurrence within 6 months of grant \neffectiveness, as well as annual PPME reports. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n66.  The project performance will be reviewed twice a year jointly by ADB, Korea Eximbank, \nand the government. These reviews will assess implementation performance, review financial \nprogress, identify issues and constraints affecting the project, work out a time-bound action plan \nfor their resolution, and verify compliance with covenants. The government, ADB, and Korea \nEximbank  will  jointly  undertake  a  detailed  midterm  review  of  the  project  after  2  years  of \nimplementation, or earlier if major difficulties threaten the project objectives. The midterm review \nwill  appraise  the  project  scope,  cost  estimates,  implementation  arrangements,  number  of \nconnections, and compliance with covenants; and identify issues to be resolved to improve \nproject impact and sustainability. The government, ADB, and Korea Eximbank will jointly decide \non  any  changes  needed  in  project  design  and  implementation  as  appropriate,  given \nimplementation experience, to achieve the project objectives. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n \n67.  The government has set a goal to electrify 80% of all villages and 90% of all households \nby 2020. The area targeted by the project, comprising the provinces of Phongsali, Xaignabouli, \nand the far west of Vientiane, is currently among the poorest and least electrified in the country. \nMore than 30% of the poorest districts in the Lao PDR are in the target provinces. The project \nwill provide grid connection for 195 villages and electrify about 18,800 households. Table 3 \nprovides details on provinces, substations, and households to be electrified. \n ", "      17 \nTable 3: Households to be Electrified in the Project Area \n \nTotal \nSubstation  Province  Households  \nBoun Nua  Phongsali  2,645 \nNonhai  Vientiane   1,541 \nPaklay  Xaignabouli   7,553 \nXayabury  Xaignabouli   7,020 \nTotal    18,759 \nSources: Electricite du Laos and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n68.  The electricity provided by the project will benefit newly connected households and \nexisting consumers, who can increase their consumption because of the more reliable and \nhigher quality supply of electricity. For some, the project will replace electricity now imported \nfrom  Thailand  through  long  medium-voltage  distribution  system.  Nonresidential  consumers, \nsuch as small-scale enterprises, schools, clinics, public services entities, and commercial users, \nalso have the opportunity to increase their electricity consumption. The Paklay and Boun Nua \nsubstations are designed with 20 MVA transforming capacity anticipating demand from future \nindustrial mining projects registered in the area.   \n \n69.  Interconnection makes use of the seasonal availability of hydropower, which is 98% of \nthe EDL generating capacity. During the dry season (March\u2013May), due to lower hydro energy, \nEDL can import power. During the wet season (August\u2013October), EDL can export power. With \nthe interconnection provided by the project, expected power flows between Paklay and Thali \nsubstations can reach 28 MW.  \n \n1.  Economic Analysis \n \n70.  The economic analysis assesses the economic viability of the project from the societal \nresource utilization point of view. Such analysis compares the project\u2019s social benefits with its \nsocial costs. Project benefits resulting from delivery of electricity to consumers are valued \nseparately for nonincremental and incremental consumption. Electricity output of the project is \ndefined as nonincremental if it replaces the existing supply of alternative sources of energy in \nthe absence of the project. It is defined as incremental if it meets additional or induced demand. \nCosts  include  the  project\u2019s  capital  investment  valued  at  economic  prices;  operation  and \nmaintenance costs equivalent to 1% of capital cost for the first 10 years, and 2% thereafter; and \nthe  economic  costs  associated  with  power  generation  and  future  distribution  investment \nrequirements.  \n \n71.  At a 12% discount rate, the economic net present value of the project is $203.7 million. \nThe project's economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 42.2% well above the real \neconomic opportunity cost of 12%. Sensitivity and risk analyses carried out demonstrate that the \neconomics of the project are robust with respect to possible variations of the key inputs, such as \n20% increase of capital costs and 40% reduction of incremental benefits due to lower demand. \nThe distribution analysis shows that electricity consumers (including nonresidential) benefit most \nfrom the project followed by local laborers. Details of the analysis are in Appendix 8. \n \n2.  Financial Analysis \n72.  The financial viability of the project is assessed by comparing the financial internal rate \nof return (FIRR) with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The FIRR is estimated at \n ", "18   \n11.5% after tax, exceeding the WACC of 2.7%. Sensitivity tests show that the FIRR exceeds the \nWACC even under a range of adverse scenarios. Thus, the project is considered financially \nviable. Detailed calculations are in Appendix 9. \n \n73.  EDL\u2019s financial viability was assessed using EDL's past financial statements. Historically, \nEDL\u2019s retail tariffs have been low relative to its cost of supply due to a cross-subsidy from \nnonresidential customers to residential customers and agriculture customer groups. In 2005, the \ngovernment approved an annual tariff adjustment program to be implemented each year for \n2005\u20132011; it progressively removes existing subsidies. With implementation of the program, \nEDL's tariff reached cost recovery in 2008 (average tariff of KN542/kWh compared with the cost \nof supply of KN468/kWh).  \n \n74.  In the past, government arrears impacted negatively on EDL's shorter-term liquidity \nposition. To address this situation, MOF and EDL began implementing an arrears settlement \nprogram in 2005. MOF increased its annual fund allocation to settle arrears from KN52 billion in \n2006 to KN118 billion in 2009. As a result, the KN140 billion accumulated arrears in 2006 were \nreduced to KN96 billion by 2009. Further, the government approved a new action plan in \nDecember  2008  to  allocate  adequate  funding  to  each  central,  provincial,  and  municipal \ngovernmental institution based on agreed annual electricity budgets to allow these institutions to \nsettle their electricity bills in a timely manner. MOF and EDL are working together to determine \nthe precise amount of outstanding arrears to settle all the arrears in the near future.  \n \n75.  To meet future investment requirements (estimated at $1.3 billion for 2007\u20132016) and to \nmaintain EDL's financial sustainability, EDL is planning to implement a new tariff adjustment \nprogram to be designed based on the results of the tariff update study (completed in June 2009 \nunder World Bank TA). The new tariff will be designed to incorporate a new tariff classification \nfor  high-voltage  customers,  capital  requirements  of  the  Power  Development  Plan,  and  an \nannual adjustment based on inflation and exchange rates. The new tariff is envisaged to be \napproved in the first quarter of 2010.  \n \n76.  EDL's financial projections for 2009\u20132016 indicate overall financial performance to be \nwithin an acceptable range: profit margin of at least 15%, debt\u2013equity ratio of 0.5\u20131.0 times, and \ndebt service coverage ratio of more than 1.5 times. Detailed analysis of EDL's past financial \nperformance and projections are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n \n1.  Environmental Impacts \n77.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) (Supplementary Appendix D) concludes that \nthe project will generate only minor environmental impacts for the following reasons: \n(i)  The 115 kV transmission line routes and substation sites were selected to avoid \nenvironmentally sensitive areas; villages; settlements; and religious, cultural, and \nor  heritage  sites.  The  transmission  line  routes  broadly  follow  existing  road \ncorridors to minimize the impacts. \n(ii)  Natural  habitats  along  selected  transmission  line  alignments  are  generally \ndegraded due to forest removal through logging, swidden agriculture, conversion \nto plantations, paddy farming, and human settlement. The zone of degradation \ngenerally extends for at least a few kilometers on either side of the road and ", "      19 \nencompasses the location of the transmission line alignments. The transmission \nlines do not encroach upon any national protected area. \n(iii)  The 22 kV distribution systems will mainly follow existing road rights-of-way, and \nwill be constructed so that local residents in villages through which the lines will \npass can connect for electricity. The installation of the system within existing road \nrights-of-way ensures that environmentally sensitive areas outside of the road \nrights-of-way will not be adversely affected. \n \n78.  Even though the environmental impacts will be minor, the IEE has an environmental \nmitigation  and  monitoring  plan  with  specific  mitigation  measures  to  reduce  the  impacts.  It \nincludes institutional arrangements for implementing the plan to ensure its effectiveness. Based \non the IEE, the PIC will prepare a project environmental management plan (PEMP) covering \npreconstruction, construction, and operation stages for modules 1, 2, and 3. The PIC will also \nprepare site or construction environmental management plans (CEMPs) for implementation by \nthe contractors for modules 1, 2, and 3. Provisions of the CEMPs will be specific to the activities \nor  work  packages  to  be  undertaken  by  the  contractors.  The  PEMP  and  CEMPs  will  be \nconsistent with the mitigation and monitoring measures, reporting, institutional arrangements, \nand training programs indicated in the IEE. The content of the PEMP and CEMPs will conform \nto the environmental management plan requirements specified in the ADB Environment Policy \n(2002). \n \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n79.  The project does not involve any relocation, and has very limited land acquisition since \nthe transmission line route is designed to minimize land acquisition and eliminate the need for \nphysical resettlement and relocation of dwellings and other assets. This includes attention to the \ntransmission route to avoid impacts, use of government land for the new substation and most of \nthe towers, and support for structure designs with the least land acquisition requirement. \n   \n80.  Based  on  the  current  transmission  line  route,  physical  construction  will  involve \npermanent acquisition of approximately 1,000 square meters (m2) for tower footprints from  \n28 households (36 m2 per tower). No affected households will lose more than 10% of their \nagricultural land. The project will also require temporary access roads to straining towers during \nline stringing. Such temporary land acquisition may affect crops; therefore, land rental and \ncompensation will be provided and the land will be returned to its original condition.  \n  \n81.  A resettlement plan was prepared to establish the involuntary resettlement screening \nand planning procedures for the project. The resettlement plan and its policies and entitlements \nwere discussed during a stakeholder workshop held in March 2007. The resettlement plan \nincludes measures for stakeholder participation and full disclosure of all information relating to \nthe  project.  In  addition,  a  project  information  booklet  prepared  by  EDL  was  distributed  to \naffected  people  in  July  2009  as  part  of  the  resettlement  plan  disclosure.  A  resettlement \nframework  was  prepared  and  provides  policies  and  entitlements  for  the  substations  and \nmedium-  (22  kV)  and  low-voltage  (400  V)  power  distribution  facilities.  The  resettlement \nframework will be used as a basis for the preparation of detailed resettlement plans after \ndetailed design and measurement surveys. The resettlement plan and resettlement framework \nwere uploaded onto the ADB website on 22 September 2009. A summary of the resettlement \nplan and resettlement framework is in Appendix 10. \n \n ", "20   \n82.  Among the 28 families affected by permanent land acquisition for towers, 10 belong to \nethnic  minorities,  including  two  Hmong  families  affected  by  module  1  and  eight  families \n(Phounoi and Yang) affected by module 3. To ensure that ethnic minority households and those \nheaded by women are not marginalized during the process of compensation, ethnic minority \nand gender-specific actions are included in the resettlement plan.  \n \n3.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n83.  In the Lao PDR, many rural poor households do not have access to electricity. The cost \nof connecting a house to the power pole in rural areas (including wires, fuses, nuts, and bolts), \nis approximately KN700,000. However, poor households may have difficulty paying for the \nconnection. To specifically help the poor, each poor household, identified by the district authority, \nwill be given a credit up to KN700,000 to cover the cost of wiring from the pole to the house and \ninside  house  wiring.  The  project  will  include  community  consultations  for  information \ndissemination to poor households about this credit scheme. About 80% of poor households in \nthe project area are expected to benefit. The social analysis of the project shows that 47% of \nthe respondents rank electricity as their first priority. Electricity is perceived as a contributing \nfactor for improving living conditions and enhancing learning opportunities for children. The \naccess to electricity will increase access to information technology, and utilization of electric \nequipment and computers in schools and health facilities. This would result in quality education \nand health services. Street lighting will contribute to safer environments at night in villages.  \n \na.  Gender  \n \n84.  The increased access to electricity will reduce the drudgery of women\u2019s domestic work \nthrough use of appliances, such as electric water pumps, rice cookers, grinders, and food \nprocessing equipment. Community meetings will be conducted in collaboration with the Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union to disseminate information on the credit scheme available to poor households \nfrom all ethnic groups and households headed by women; these will be given special attention \nto ensure their access to electricity. The safer environment at night will have a positive impact \non women's mobility. A project-specific gender strategy is included in the summary of poverty \nreduction and social strategy (Appendix 11).  \n \nb.  Risk \n \n85.  To ensure that rural communities who will get access to electricity under this project will \nhave sufficient knowledge on the safe use of electricity and safety around the power line, EDL \nwill provide an electricity safety booklet to the communities. During construction, the number of \nworkers will increase considerably; this presents a potential risk of HIV and trafficking of women. \nTo minimize this risk, an awareness campaign on HIV and human trafficking will be conducted \nunder the project.  \n \nC.  Risks and Assumptions  \n86.  The project is not likely to face any significant technical difficulties as the technology is \nstandard and widely available. EDL has good experience and performed well in similar projects; \nin particular, managerial skills of staff have improved through implementation of the Northern \nArea Rural Power Distribution Project (footnote 7). With the opportunity to apply their skills and \nlessons from the previous project, EDL staff are expected to have improved by the end of this \nproject. \n ", "      21 \n87.  The project may face a risk of cost overrun. To counter this risk, the cost estimate was \nupdated and appropriate price and physical contingencies are allowed. International competitive \nbidding will be used for ADB-financed packages. The Korea Eximbank fund includes sufficient \ncontingencies for packages to be financed by Korea Eximbank (14%). Another issue of possible \nconcern is the coordination between packages and project components. Having a single PIC, \nthat will be in charge of detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, and implementation \nof environmental management plan and resettlement plan, ensures that coordination will be \nsatisfactory.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n88.

Resettlement Matters \n(i)  The government will ensure that all land and right-of-way required for the project \nare made available in a timely manner. The government through EDL will ensure \nthat  appropriate  resettlement  plans  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nappropriate national laws and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), in \nconsultation with the affected people. In case of discrepancy ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy will apply. The resettlement activities will be carried out \naccording to the resettlement plans agreed between the government and ADB. \nThe executing agency will endorse and disclose all plans to the public and submit \nthem to ADB for approval. The resettlement plans will be updated as soon as \npracticable  after  completion  of  detailed  designs  and  detailed  measurement \nsurvey. .  ", "      23 \n(ii)  Any civil works will be commenced only after the resettlement plan has been \napproved by ADB and required land has been acquired and affected households \nhave been compensated at full replacement cost. \n(iii)  Adequate budgetary support will be committed by the government and made \navailable to cover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement. \n(iv)  Prior to the commencement of any civil works in a given construction site under \nthe project, the government and EDL shall cause and ensure that a company, \nwhich is licensed under the government's law to undertake the clearance of \nunexploded ordnance in the Lao PDR, has been engaged under the project to \nclear all unexploded ordnance in such construction site and, after the relevant \nclearance work is completed, has issued a certificate to that effect. \n \nB.  Grant Effectiveness Conditions \n89.

The energy sector plays a pivotal role in economic growth and social development of the \nLao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The country has significant energy resources \nespecially  hydropower\u2014about  18,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  hydropower  can  be  developed. \nHowever, to date only 3.3% of the hydropower resources are being utilized. High-quality lignite \n(estimated at 220 million tons) was found in Hongsa district of Xaignabouli province near the \nborder with Thailand. Private investors plan to develop the lignite mines for power generation at \nHongsa (1,800 MW) and to export power to Thailand. Renewable energy sources in the Lao \nPDR are still in the development stages. Biomass resources essentially consist of wood fuels, \nused for cooking and heating, normally by the rural population. The potential for wind energy is \nlimited. Small hydropower and photovoltaic modules are already used in remote areas. Small \nhydropower will play an increasing role as a means of rural electrification. \n \n2.  The  power  system  serves  two  vital  national  priorities: (i)  it  provides  a  reliable  and \naffordable supply of power to facilitate business and provide social benefits to urban and rural \ncommunities,  and  (ii)  it  earns  foreign  exchange  revenues  from  electricity  exports.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  power  policy  facilitates  these  objectives  by  encouraging  optimal  use  of  the \ncountry\u2019s natural resources, and creating a conducive environment for responsible infrastructure \ninvestment, both public and private. \n \n3.  The  power  system  currently  has  small  generating  capacity  and  a  fragmented \ntransmission and distribution (T&D) system. The total installed generating capacity is 692 MW, \ncomprising 310 MW owned by Electricite du Laos (EDL), 362 MW owned by independent power \nproducers (IPPs),1 and 20 MW belonging to provincial authorities. About 98% of this capacity is \nhydro based, the remaining 2% is diesel based. The existing power system covers four isolated \nT&D regions\u2014northern, central 1, central 2, and southern\u2014serving about 250,000 customers in \ntotal. The existing domestic power grids include 115 kilovolt (kV) and 22 kV transmission and \ndistribution systems. Transmission lines interconnect between the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet \nNam for power export and import. The largest EDL hydropower plants providing power mainly \nfor domestic supply are Nam Ngum 1 (155 MW), followed by Nam Leuk (60 MW), Nam Mang 3 \n(45 MW), and Xeset (40 MW). Several new large IPP hydropower plants are under construction, \nmostly for export, including Nam Theun 2 hydropower project (1,070 MW, with 70 MW for \ndomestic supply); Nam Ngum 2 (615 MW for export); Theun Hinboun extension (220 MW for \nexport to Thailand plus 60 MW for domestic supply) to be commissioned in 2012; and Xe \nKaman 3 (250 MW for export to Viet Nam).   \n \n4.  EDL was incorporated as a public company under a charter approved by the Ministry of \nIndustry and Handicrafts in 1997 (renamed the Ministry of Energy and Mines [MEM] in 2007). \nEDL  is  responsible  for  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  its \ngenerating plants, T&D and substation facilities, and power exports.  \n \nA.  Sector Issues and Development Challenges \n \n5.  Access  to  electricity  and  rural  electrification  target.  Rural  electrification  is  an \nimportant  aspect  of  poverty  reduction\u2014a  highest  priority  of  the  government\u2019s  6th  National \nSocio-Economic Development Plan, which aims to graduate the country from least developing \ncountry status by 2020. Currently, 58% of households in the country have access to grid \n                                                \n1  These are Theun Hinboun hydropower plant (210 MW) with 60% shareholding by EDL, and Houay Ho hydropower \nplant (150 MW) with 20% shareholding by EDL. ", "Appendix 2  27 \nelectricity.  The  government  has  set  a  plan  to  electrify  the  country  by  2020,  with  specific \ntargets\u201480% of the total number of villages and 90% of the total households will be supplied \nwith electricity from the national grid.2 Northern provinces are currently the least electrified \nbecause the national grid does not reach many provinces. To achieve the national targets, an \nincrease  in  the  electrification  rate  for  the  northern  and  southern  provinces  should  be \naccelerated. This would require an increase in the household electrification rate from 13% to \n28% in Phongsali, and from 14% to 32% in Oudomxai by expanding the current EDL electricity \nT&D network. \n \n6.  Grid extension to meet increasing demand. A significant challenge is the integration \nof the four regional grids presently operating in isolation. EDL\u2019s Power Development Plan has \ndeveloped a demand forecast to include the electrification plan for each area, to be satisfied \nwith a combination of additional generation, imports and/or exports from other areas, and cross-\nborder imports and exports. The plan up to 2020 includes a general policy of building more \nhydropower plants in each region, striking a balance between the regions, and selling increasing \nsurplus energy to neighboring countries. By 2020, the country is expected to have a fully \nintegrated national grid, largely at 230 kV and 115 kV. The unified national grid will help to \nachieve rural electrification targets as well as boost the socioeconomic development of the \ncountry. \n \n7.  Sustainable hydropower development. Development of large hydropower projects will \ncontinue to be justified if social and environmental impacts, resettlement, and compensation \nmatters are carefully assessed and mitigated, and if the net benefits are shared equitably \nbetween investors and the population, who are ultimately the owners of the natural resources. \nThe  revenues  generated  from  increased  export  earnings  will  be  vital  to  improving  basic \ngovernment services, including education, health, and infrastructure services in poor areas of \nthe country. The government can obtain benefits from hydropower projects through concession \nfees,  royalties,  taxation,  and  returns  on  its  equity  stake  in  particular  projects.  While  past \nhydropower projects have generated substantial revenues, these have primarily been used to \nfinance the operations of EDL. Revenues from future hydropower projects will need to be \nmanaged to ensure they increase public spending for poverty reduction. The government\u2019s \nHydropower  Sustainable  Development  Policy  provides  guidance  for  exploration  of  national \nresources in a sustainable manner. The challenge is developing the capacity to implement the \npolicy while developing hydropower projects. Currently, the Water Resource and Environment \nAdministration is responsible for implementing the environmental protection policies and social \nresettlement policies. The Water Resources and Environment Administration has asked the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to help build its capacity to meet this challenge.  \n \n8.  Mobilization of financial resource for investment. The investment requirements in the \npower system to 2016 total $1,260 million (Table A2.1). \n \n9.  Private sector participation. Private sector participation in power system development \nwill  be  needed  to  achieve  the  government\u2019s  power  development  targets.  The  government \nexpects half of the investment requirements to be secured from the private sector, particularly \nfor generation. Although many private investors are interested in participating in export-oriented \nIPP projects, greater efforts are required to create a favorable investment environment. The \ngovernment needs to define appropriate roles for the public and private sectors, as the country \nis still in transition to a market-based economy. Sector restructuring will be required, including \n                                                \n2  In 2007, 5,289 villages (about 50% of the national total) with a population of about 2.6 million did not have access \nto electricity. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nestablishing  institutions  to  facilitate  IPP  participation,  introducing  a  transparent  bidding \nmechanism,  and  adopting  best  practices for formulating  power  purchase  agreements. The \ngovernment  is  also  taking  steps  to  put  in  place  an  appropriate  regulatory  framework  to \nencourage private sector participation. The Department of Energy Development and Promotion \nhas asked ADB to help enhance its capacity for managing IPP projects. \n \nTable A2.1: Investment Requirements for System Development \n($ million) \nProjects  Foreign Cost   Local Cost  Total Cost  \nGenerating plantsa  484.3  121.1  605.4 \nTransmission lines  253.4  105.2  358.6 \nSubstations  70.5  10.4  80.9 \nDispatch control center  13.4  5.8  19.2 \nRural electrification  131.3  32.8  164.1 \nOverhaul and distribution reinforcement  25.8  6.4  32.2 \n  Total  978.7  281.7  1,260.4 \na Excluding all investments on IPPs. \nSource: Power Development Plan, 2007\u20132016. \n \n10.  Maintenance of financial viability. EDL\u2019s gross income in 2007 was KN678 billion \n($71 million), and the net profit was KN104 billion ($11 million). This amount of internal cash \ngeneration is clearly inadequate to finance an investment requirement of about $1.3 billion over \n2007\u20132016 to meet the fast-growing demand. To be able to raise funds for development, a plan \nto increase the average customer tariff from the present $0.06/kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2007 to \n$0.10/kWh in 2016 was suggested. The tariff adjustments proposed are based on the following \ncriteria: (i) self-financing ratio at least 30%, (ii) debt service coverage ratio to be more than 1.5, \nand (iii) the debt\u2013equity ratio less than 1.5. A progressive tariff increase of an average 1% per \nyear3 has  been  implemented  since  2006  and  will  continue  until  2011.  This  tariff  revision \nremoves cross-subsidies that existed between low-income households and agriculture, and \ncommerce and industry. In addition, the unsatisfactory settlement of electricity bills affects the \nfinancial  viability  of  EDL.  With  continued  assistance  and  support  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners,  the  government  has  taken  concrete  steps  to  introduce  a  more \nappropriate  tariff  adjustment  mechanism,  and  to  settle  overdue  payment  arrears  from \ngovernment agencies. Adherence to progressive tariff adjustment and strict payment policies \nare critical to improve EDL\u2019s financial performance, especially in view of the large investment \nrequirement for the upcoming decade. Key financial ratios, such as debt service ratio, self-\nfinancing ratio, and debt\u2013equity ratio are expected to be under pressure. \n \n11.  Institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building.  In  parallel  with  infrastructure  \ndevelopment, the power system needs institutional development to cope with the increasing \nrequirement to manage the system rationally and sustainably. This institutional strengthening \nincludes (i) reform of the electricity tariff to full cost recovery, (ii) setting up a legal framework for \nmore efficient utilization of energy resources and energy products, (iii) capacity building for \nimplementation  of  environmental  protection  and  social  and  resettlement  policies,  and  \n(iv) establishment of best practices. Institutional and national capacity becomes ever more \nimportant given integration of the Lao PDR with neighboring countries in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS). \n                                                \n3  Decision No. 845/PMO dated 6 June 2005.  ", "Appendix 2  29 \n \nB.  Government\u2019s Development Strategy  \n \n12.  Although the Lao PDR has a vast quantity of economically viable hydropower resources \nand is developing a major regional export market for its hydropower resources, its per capita \nconsumption rate (223 kWh) and electrification rate (54%) in 2007 are among the lowest in Asia. \nRecognizing both the economic and social advantages of electrification and the low rate of \ndomestic  consumption,  the  government\u2019s  power  development  strategy  states  that  energy \nresources represent a major opportunity for economic development and assist in reducing \npoverty  and  increasing  development  of  the  country.  It  has  four  medium-term  priorities: \n(i) maintain  and  expand  affordable,  reliable,  and  sustainable  electricity  supply  to  promote \neconomic and social development; (ii) promote power generation for export to provide revenues \nto meet development objectives; (iii) develop and enhance the legal and regulatory framework \nto direct and facilitate power system development; and (iv) reform institutions and institutional \nstructures  to  clarify  responsibilities,  strengthen  commercial  functions,  and  streamline \nadministration. The government\u2019s  plan  to  2020 for  power  involves  rapid  and  simultaneous \ndevelopment on several fronts by (i) expanding generation, transmission, distribution, and off-\ngrid development to increase the electrification rate for the country from about 58% in 2008 to \n90% by 2020; (ii) increasing government revenues from IPP investments and honoring power \nexport commitments with Thailand (7,000 MW) and Viet Nam (5,000 MW) by promoting IPP \ngeneration development; (iii) building a national unified T&D system to cover all regions of the \ncountry; and (iv) promoting the development of a 500 kV transmission grid with neighboring \nGMS countries to integrate the Lao PDR power system with their power systems.  \n \nC.  Priority Areas for ADB Support  \n \n1.  Improving Access to Electricity  \n13.  Targets of electrification. The government's target of electrifying 90% of households in \n2020 requires an average addition of 41,000 new electrified households every year from now \nuntil 2019. EDL estimates that six rural electrification projects would have to be initiated to \nimplement  the  work  during  2009\u20132020.4 Owing  to  its  clear  benefits  and  alignment  with \ngovernment  policy,  ADB's  continued  assistance  to  future  rural  electrification  projects  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy. ADB\u2019s focus will continue to be on the northern region, \nowing to its very low electrification rates seen in its provinces, some as low as 7%. Apart from \nrural electrification, which requires specific attention by way of concessionary loans, regular \ndistribution upgrades and maintenance should be the responsibility of EDL, with investment \ncoming from internal cash generation. No other development agencies have major investments \nin the northern region for rural electrification.   \n \n14.  Transmission  system  to  strengthen  regional  grid  integration.  Intra-  and \ninterregional transmission development is key to harnessing hydropower resources for the Lao \nPDR's own requirements. Good transmission connectivity would decrease the need for higher-\npriced imports, and enable exports through existing links. These are in addition to the export \nhydropower projects, which have their own dedicated transmission system. A further objective \nof developing the local transmission network would be to ensure that the entitlement of EDL \nfrom existing and new export IPPs can be fully utilized and distributed among customers. \nAccordingly,  from  EDL\u2019s  perspective,  transmission  investments  can  fulfill  one  of  the  three \nprincipal objectives: (i) to provide hydropower from EDL or domestic IPPs to the EDL grid, (ii) to \n                                                \n4  EDL. 2007. Power Development Plan. Vientiane (Appendix 3). \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nenable EDL to fully use it entitlement from export projects (existing and new), and (iii) to serve \ncustomers in urban and remote areas. Transmission connections to provide hydropower to the \ngrid are usually included in such power project development.  \n \n2.  Maximizing Benefits of Hydropower Exports \n15.  ADB\u2019s support will focus on creating an enabling environment for investors to continue \nwith the development of hydropower and other resources for export, while ensuring that the \nbenefits to the Lao PDR and its institutions are maximized. In this respect, ADB will support  \n(i) developing transmission interconnections to serve the 10% entitlement of export projects to \nEDL customers, and (ii) enabling EDL customers and the network to be interlinked to the \ntransmission line serving export customers to ensure maximum benefits of such infrastructure to \nthe Lao PDR. \n \n3.  Promoting Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \n16.  A demand-side management (DSM) unit at EDL is presently functioning, conducting \nnetwork loss improvement programs (in association with distribution areas), and implementing \ntasks under the World Bank-assisted DSM program focusing on capacity building and energy \nauditing. The DSM unit needs to developed, but more important is the development a national \npolicy framework for energy efficiency and conservation. ADB has started assisting the Lao \nPDR on this front. Much of the support will be for capacity building for MEM to promote \nrenewable energy development and implementation of energy efficiency. On-grid and off-grid \ndevelopment of nonconventional renewable energy is being promoted by various government \nand  international  agencies.  Future  ADB  assistance  will  focus  on  developing  two  small \nhydropower projects. \n \n4.  Developing Energy Policy and Planning \n17.  The Lao PDR lacks a comprehensive energy sector database, a planning and policy \nanalysis framework, and associated key human resources. Electricity statistics are available to a \nlarge extent, but a national energy balance including other sources (biomass, petroleum, coal \nand lignite) is not prepared regularly. ADB assistance will aim to assist MEM in developing an \nenergy  policy  analysis  and  development  framework,  energy  planning,  and  database \ndevelopment functions.  \n \n18.  Together with other development partners, ADB, through grants, technical support, and \npolicy dialogue, will continue to support the (i) commercialization of EDL; (ii) development of \nappropriate regulatory arrangements; (iii) expansion of an affordable, reliable, and sustainable \nelectricity supply system; (iv) adoption of off-grid power generation and alternative technologies \nwhere grid-fed electrification is not feasible, especially small and mini hydro; and (v) private \nsector participation in developing and operating the power system. Given the export orientation, \nforging suitable public\u2013private partnerships to develop the country\u2019s tremendous hydropower \nresources in an environmentally, socially, and fiscally responsible manner is central to the long-\nterm development of the Lao PDR. ADB support for public\u2013private partnerships in the energy \nsector will be provided primarily through the GMS Program and the Private Sector Operations \nDepartment. Priority will be accorded to development of the transmission system in the northern \nregion of the country, along the north\u2013south economic corridor. With the development of high-\nvoltage  transmission  and  distribution  facilities,  the  national  electrification  rate  will  steadily \nimprove and regional power trade will be facilitated. ", "Appendix 3  31 \nDEVELOPMENT PARTNER COORDINATION \n \n1.  Various development partners provide assistance and support to the energy sector, \nespecially for power in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The key partners are \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), and recently the Government of Finland.  \n \n2.  ADB. ADB\u2019s cumulative lending to the country\u2019s energy sector stood at $323 million by \nthe end of 2008. ADB has focused on hydropower development, transmission and distribution \ndevelopment, and rural electrification. Technical assistance (TA) has largely served the various \nneeds of the loans, but additional support was provided for (i) institutional development and \ncapacity building, (ii) strategy and planning studies, and (iii) development of mini-hydro power \nplants.  Through  its  significant  lending  to  power  generation  projects,  ADB  has,  in  general, \nprovided more assistance to the energy sector than other development agencies. \n   \n3.  World Bank. The World Bank is engaged in TA and financing projects in the sector. Its \nfocus areas for TA are tariff reforms and energy efficiency, and the areas of investment support \nare  energy  efficiency  and  loss  reduction,  and  rural  electrification.  Currently,  the  following \nprograms are active: (i) strengthening capacity building for hydropower and mining, (ii) electricity \ntariff study, (iii) rural electrification, and (iv) demand-side management. \n \n4.  JICA. The TA focus areas are planning and feasibility studies on hydropower plants; \ninvestment support focuses on power transmission, with limited support for distribution, and \npossible future assistance for capacity expansion of hydropower plants. JICA\u2019s policy is that \nsupport will be provided only to improve services to customers in the Lao PDR. Its assistance is \nlimited to projects and programs executed by Electricite du Laos (EDL), not those for export.  \n \n5.  Government of Finland. The focus area for Finland\u2019s support is renewable energy \ndevelopment.  Currently,  it  is financing the  Preparation  of  Renewable  Energy  Strategy  and \nCapacity Building project. The work may include some capacity building on energy efficiency \nimprovement. \n \n6.  In the past, assistance by ADB and other agencies has been in line with government \npolicies and plans to increase electrification, improve transmission within the regional grids, \ninterconnect the presently separated regional grids, increase hydropower generating capacity, \nand provide associated technical support and capacity building. Support to the following areas \nappears to be low: (i) small hydropower development and engagement of the private sector in \nsuch efforts; (ii) capacity building in national energy planning, policy analysis, and information; \nand (iii) energy efficiency including demand-side management. In the future, ADB will assist the \ngovernment  in  energy  planning,  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy  development,  and \nassociated capacity building. These will be coordinated with key development partners, such as \nthe World Bank and JICA.

The economic analysis assesses the economic viability of the project from the societal \nresource  utilization  perspective.  Such  analysis  compares  social  benefits  generated  by  the \nproject with its economic costs for with- and without-project scenarios. The analysis begins with \nthe demand analysis, followed by system least-cost planning, and identification of the project's \nbenefits  to  consumers.  The  benefits  are  quantified  and  differentiated  as  incremental  or \nnonincremental. The costs are adjusted using shadow conversion factors to reflect their true \neconomic values.  \n \nA.  Demand Projection \n \n2.  The demand forecast is based on the demand forecast made by Electricite du Lao (EDL) \nup to 2020 and extended to 2035 (Table A8.1). The forecast projects demand for residential and \nnonresidential consumers and committed mining loads for each module under the project. For \nthe calculation in the analysis, the project demand is the difference between the with-project \ndemand and without-project demand. \n \nTable A8.1: Summary Demand Forecast by Module \n \nDemand, GWh  2008  2012  2016  2020  2025  2030  2035 \nModule 1  13.98  269.63  279.53  292.30  308.53  330.35  359.71 \nModule 2  12.35  21.50  30.25  41.52  55.85  75.12  101.04 \nModule 3  2.11  3.85  251.72  254.68  258.41  263.63  270.92 \nTotal   28.44  294.98  561.50  588.50  622.79  669.10  731.67 \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Least Cost Analysis \n \n3.  EDL  has  prepared  several  power  system  expansion  plans  in  recent  years,  both \nindependently and with the support of international consultants. The latest plan is the Power \nDevelopment Plan 2007\u20132016 (PDP) signed into effect by EDL management in 2008. The PDP \nspecifies the demand forecast up to 2020, which is used in the demand analysis; generation \nexpansion plan; and transmission and distribution expansion plan. \n \n4.  Transmission  planning for the  project  area  aims  to  deliver  power from the  existing \nnational grid and its least-cost generation expansion mix to the load centers in the area. This \nanalysis was conducted with the powerful PSS/E (power systems simulator for engineering) \nsoftware package. The PSS/E model designs the least-cost system, taking into account the \ndemand,  system  losses,  and  capital  costs,  subject  to  power  system  security  and  stability \nconstraints. The load-carrying requirements of the transmission lines and their operating voltage \nare selected using least-cost planning criteria, and the locations and capacity of substations are \nselected to deliver the power to load centers at least cost. The PSS/E analysis concludes that \n115  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines  can  be  expected  to  meet  the  long-term  electricity \nrequirements of the project provinces. Preliminary designs and costs were developed for single-\ntower  single-circuit  and  double-tower  single-circuit  configurations.  The  latter  option  is \nrecommended as the least cost means to meet the requirements of the forecast over the \n ", "  Appendix 8  43 \nanticipated life of the transmission investments, and is adopted for purposes of this economic \nanalysis. The PDP and the transmission planning establish that the project is part of the least-\ncost plan. \n \nC.  Project Costs \n \n5.  The  costs  of  the  project  include  (i)  cost  of  supply,  construction,  installation,  and \ncommissioning of the 115 kV transmission lines, 115/22 kV substations, and medium- and low-\nvoltage  distribution  network  (including  connections  to  poor  households),  and  (ii)  consulting \nservices. The project's costs are estimated based on the detailed breakdown of components, \nequipment, and works associated with them. For economic analysis, the project's cost includes \nphysical contingencies but excludes taxes and duties. Total project cost amounts to $56.44 \nmillion. \n \nTable A8.2: Estimated Project Costs \n \nConversion \n      Factors   \n Item  Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total \nLand acquisition and resettlement  0  365  365  0  1.00  365 \nCivil works  9,801  5,659  15,460  1.08  0.92  15,791 \nEquipment and materials  22,315  6,182  28,497  1.08  1.00  30,282 \nUnexploded ordnance clearance  111  472  583  1.08  0.92  554 \nConsulting services  2,619  655  3,274  1.08  0.92  3,431 \nPoor households wiring credit  0  750  750  1.08  1.00  750 \nSenior advisory service  600  0  600  1.08  0.00  648 \nExecuting and implementing agency \nmanagement and administration  102  827  929  1.08  1.00  937 \nPhysical contingencies  4,597  1,382  5,979  1.08  1.00  6,347 \nTotal  40,145  16,292  56,437      59,106 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  To reflect true economic values of costs, shadow price conversion factors are used. The \nproject preparatory technical assistance study carefully examined the shadow prices for the Lao \nPDR and suggests the following conversion factors: (i) 1.08 for tradable goods of foreign origin, \n(ii) 1.00 for nontradable, (iii) 1.08 for foreign labor, and (iv) 0.90 for local unskilled labor. \nApplying these conversion factors to the cost components, the economic cost of the project \namounts to $59.11 million. In addition to this investment cost, the economic evaluation takes \ninto account the operation and maintenance cost, which is estimated at 1% of the investment \ncost for the first 10 years, and 2% thereafter. Since benefits are estimated at end use, the \ngeneration  cost  must  be  subtracted.  This  is  to  avoid  double  counting  even  though  the \ngeneration cost is not part of the project costs. Generation cost is estimated to be 53% of EDL's \nlong-run marginal cost of supply according to the latest tariff study. \n ", "44   Appendix 8 \n \n \nD.  Project Benefits \n \n7.  The benefits of the project manifest in the increase of electricity sales to consumers in \nthe with-project scenario. By projecting demand forecasts and comparing the demand without \nthe project with the demand forecast with the project, the increase in electricity consumption \nwas established. \n \n1.  Project Benefits from Domestic Power Sales \n \n8.  The benefits are classified as incremental and nonincremental, and are additive to the \ntotal benefits. They are quantified based on the gross benefits model (Figure A8). Electricity \noutput of the project is defined as nonincremental if it replaces the existing supply of energy\u2014\nthe without-project source, and it is defined as incremental if it meets additional or induced \ndemand. \n \nFigure A8: The Gross Benefits Model \n  Supply Curve Without Project\nDemand Curve (D)\nP\nwo        \n  Supply Curve With Project\na  b\nP\nw \nc  d\nQ Q\nwo w\nNon-Incremental Incremental  \nNotes: \n1.  D is a straight-line demand curve for electricity defined by two points, (P , Q ) and (P , Q ); \nwo wo w w\n2.  P  and P  are prices, of electricity equivalents without the project, and of electricity with the \nwo w\nproject \n3.  Q  and Q  are estimates of the quantity consumed without and with the project \nwo w\n4.  Area (a + c) = nonincremental project benefits \n5.  Area (b + d) = incremental project benefits. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n9.  Nonincremental benefits of electricity are valued based on the cost of supply without the \nproject (appropriately converted to economic costs with shadow conversion factors)\u2014P  in \nwo\n ", "  Appendix 8  45 \nFigure A8.1, whereas incremental benefits are valued at an average of the cost of electricity \nwithout and with the project\u2014average of P  and P . The cost of electricity substitutes are \nwo w\nestimated for residential and nonresidential consumers (including industry, commercial, and \nagricultural users): \n(i)  Based on data from the socioeconomic survey, in the absence of electricity, \nhouseholds usually have to rely on diesel or kerosene and batteries (e.g., dry cell \nbatteries for radios and cassette players and 12-volt batteries for televisions). \n(ii)  Nonresidential consumers are all assumed to derive energy from small diesel \ngeneration sets.  \n \n10.  Incremental consumption is valued as the weighted average of the cost of the alternative \nenergy source and the anticipated electricity tariff. For currently importing consumers, the value \nof electricity is the weighted average of the postproject tariff and the cost of supply in the \nabsence of the project (i.e., the import tariff). Similarly, in the case of other induced demand of \nresidential and nonresidential consumers, it is valued at the weighted average of the postproject \ntariff and the cost of substitutes in the absence of electricity. The project preparatory technical \nassistance study has developed detailed estimates of economic benefits of project electricity by \nconsumer category, and incremental and nonincremental consumption (Table A8.3). The values \nare applied for economic evaluation. \n \nTable A8.3: Estimates of Economic Values of Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity by Category \n \nItem  KN/kWh \nNonincremental Benefits   \nResidential  3,128 \nNonresidential  2,756 \nIncremental Benefits   \nResidential  1,742 \nNonresidential  1,806 \nNonresidential (major loads)  1,317 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour.     \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  Project Benefits from Exports to Thailand \n11.  In addition to the benefits associated with domestic power sales, the project will make \npossible incremental power exchange with Thailand on an as-available basis. The load flow \nstudies indicate that the Paklay\u2013Thali border crossing will support the export maximum of  \n28 megawatts (MW) in 2014. In the dry season, imports reach 17 MW in 2014. The net export is \nconsidered  variable  and  nonfirm.  The  net  export  is  estimated  to  be  32.4  gigawatt-hours \n(GWh)/year, equivalent to $275,000 in net economic benefit. This resulting net benefit is added \nto project domestic sales revenues to estimate project economic benefits. \n \nE.  Results of the Analysis \n \n12.  The evaluation of project costs and benefits are summarized in Table A8.4, which is an \neconomic resource statement for the life of the project. The economic net present value of the \nproject is $203.7 million. The project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be \n42.2%, well above the real economic opportunity cost of 12%. \n \n ", "46   Appendix 8 \n \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n13.  A sensitivity analysis was undertaken with respect to key risk factors and assumptions \nexpected to influence the viability of the investment. The most important factor is the impact of \nindustrial loads on the benefits. To test this influence, the mining load is reduced to 40% below \nthe base case. The second factor is the project cost. The analysis allows for cost overruns up to \na 20% increase (very high according to EDL). The impact of net export is also analyzed by \nlooking at the case that excludes the revenue from exports. The sensitivity analysis shows that \nthe project's economics are robust (Table A8.5). Even in the extreme case when the negative \nevents  are  considered  in  combination,  the  project  is  still  viable  with  net  present  value  of  \n$23.7 million and EIRR of 16%.  \n \nTable A8.4: Project Economic Resource Statement  \n($'000) \nYear Benefits Costs Net benefit\nNon-Incremental Incremental Total benefits Capital Generation Distribution O&M Total costs\n2009 0 0 0 18029 0 0 0 18029.1 -18029.1\n2010 0 0 0 23405 0 0 0 23405.1 -23405.1\n2011 0 0 0 17672 0 0 0 17672.2 -17672.2\n2012 2721.2 35493.1 38214.2 0 14899.4 1258.6 578.6 16736.6 21477.6\n2013 2939.8 68681.1 71620.9 0 28055.5 1258.6 591.2 29905.3 41715.6\n2014 3175.3 69001.0 72176.3 0 28272.7 1258.6 603.8 30135.1 42041.2\n2015 3429.2 70073.2 73502.4 0 28501.1 1258.6 616.4 30376.0 43126.4\n2016 3698.4 71365.0 75063.4 0 28735.4 1258.6 629.0 30622.9 44440.5\n2017 3989.0 71855.7 75844.6 0 28984.7 1258.6 641.5 30884.9 44959.7\n2018 4302.7 72357.5 76660.2 0 29246.7 1258.6 654.1 31159.4 45500.8\n2019 4641.8 72908.9 77550.7 0 29533.1 1258.6 666.7 31458.5 46092.3\n2020 5008.6 73472.0 78480.6 0 29834.2 1258.6 679.3 31772.1 46708.5\n2021 5311.0 73926.3 79237.2 0 30079.3 1258.6 691.9 32029.8 47207.5\n2022 5647.5 74400.2 80047.7 0 30339.5 1258.6 1409.0 33007.1 47040.6\n2023 5997.0 74908.1 80905.1 0 30616.0 1258.6 1434.1 33308.7 47596.4\n2024 6368.1 75447.7 81815.9 0 30909.7 1258.6 1459.3 33627.6 48188.3\n2025 6762.3 76021.0 82783.3 0 31221.7 1258.6 1484.5 33964.7 48818.5\n2026 7180.8 76630.0 83810.8 0 31553.0 1258.6 1509.6 34321.3 49489.5\n2027 7625.3 77277.0 84902.3 0 31905.1 1258.6 1534.8 34698.5 50203.9\n2028 8097.4 77964.4 86061.8 0 32279.0 1258.6 1560.0 35097.6 50964.2\n2029 8598.7 78694.6 87293.4 0 32676.2 1258.6 1585.2 35520.0 51773.4\n2030 9131.2 79470.5 88601.6 0 33098.2 1258.6 1610.3 35967.1 52634.5\n2031 9696.6 80294.7 89991.3 0 33546.4 1258.6 1635.5 36440.5 53550.8\n2032 10297.1 81170.4 91467.5 0 34022.6 1258.6 1660.7 36941.9 54525.7\n2033 10934.9 82100.8 93035.7 0 34528.4 1258.6 1685.8 37472.9 55562.8\n2034 11612.2 83089.3 94701.4 0 35065.8 1258.6 1711.0 38035.4 56666.0\n2035 12331.5 84139.4 96471.0 0 35636.6 1258.6 1736.2 38631.4 57839.6\n2036 12701.5 84676.5 97378.0 0 35929.1 1258.6 1736.2 38923.9 58454.1\n2037 13082.5 85229.7 98312.2 0 36230.3 1258.6 1736.2 39225.1 59087.1\n2038 13475.0 85799.4 99274.4 0 36540.5 1258.6 1736.2 39535.3 59739.1\n2039 13879.3 86386.3 100265.5 0 36860.1 1258.6 1736.2 39854.9 60410.7\n2040 14295.6 86990.7 101286.4 0 37189.2 1258.6 1736.2 40184.0 61102.4\n2041 14724.5 87613.3 102337.8 0 37528.2 1258.6 1736.2 40523.0 61814.8\nEIRR = 42.2%\n \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M= operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 8  47 \nTable A8.5: Project Sensitivity Analysis \n Item  NPV ($ million)  EIRR (%) \nBase  203.7  42.2 \nExcluding export  202.0  42.0 \n+20% cost  194.2  37.3 \n\u201340% benefits  33.2  18.6 \nCombined  23.7  16.1 \nNPV = net present value; EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation. \n \nG.  Risk Analysis \n \n14.  The risk analysis examines the range of project outcomes by allowing multiple risk \nfactors to vary randomly (within a defined range). Three key risk factors identified include  \n(i) capital and operating costs, (ii) sales ratio (i.e., the ratio of actual to planned GWh sales), and \n(iii)  the  value  of  nonincremental  benefits.  Probability  distributions  were  assigned  to  each \nvariable as follows: \n \n(i)  Capital costs during construction and operating costs over the project life were \nallowed to vary randomly from 85% (low) to 115% (high), with a most likely value \n(mode) of 100% (i.e., their point-value in the model). \n(ii)  Project GWh sales were allowed to vary randomly within a specified range to \nreflect uncertainty regarding achievement of new household connection targets \nnecessary to realize project benefits. The assumed range was 25% (low), 100% \n(mode), and 110% (high). \n(iii)  The value of nonincremental benefits were allowed to vary from 85% to 115% \n(around an average of 100%), reflecting uncertainty surrounding the point values \nassigned in estimating these benefits. \n \n15.  The risk  analysis  was  conducted  based  on  10,000  Monte-Carlo  iterations,  with  the \noutput variable being the expected EIRR (Table A8.6).  \n \nTable A8.6: Risk Analysis\u2014Distribution of EIRR \n \n Item   Value \nExpected EIRR (mean), %  42.2 \nStandard deviation  2.35 \nStandard error  0.00024 \nMaximum EIRR, %  48.5 \nMinimum EIRR, %  37.1 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "48   Appendix 9 \n \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT \n \n1.  The  project's  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The analysis \nassesses the financial viability of the project from the perspective of Electricite du Laos (EDL), \nthe project operating entity. The financial costs and benefits employed in the analysis are \nexpressed in 2009 prices on an after-tax basis. Costs include only capital costs and operating \nand maintenance costs directly associated with the project. Likewise, benefits are restricted to \nanticipated end-user sales from the project based on the average retail tariff yield. Financial \nviability is assessed on the basis of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) over the project\u2019s \neconomic useful life (2009\u20132041) relative to the cost of capital used to fund the project, which is \nmeasured by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The net present value is calculated \nas the net financial benefit of the project discounted at the WACC over its economic useful life. \n \nA.  Capital Costs \n \n2.  Capital costs include a 115 kilovolt (kV) transmission line (398 kilometers [km]) and \nassociated substations, as well as a 22 kV distribution line (1,116 km) and medium- and low-\nvoltage substations. Capital costs include the base project costs plus physical contingencies but \nexclude price contingencies and interest during construction. Costs for unexploded ordnance \nclearance  are  included  in  the  capital  costs.  Annual  operating  and  maintenance  costs  are \nestimated at 1% of capital investment costs for the first 10 years, and 2% thereafter. All the \nworks are assumed to be completed over 3 years, commencing in 2010. \n \nB.  Tariff \n \n3.  The weighted average residential tariff for the project areas will be KN502/kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) ($0.0588/kWh) in 2009, and will be increased as in Table A9.1. The project area tariff \nyield for the base case is assumed to be set at 85% of the national revenue requirement for \nresidential consumption. Nonresidential customers are assumed to receive electricity at medium \nvoltage at a tariff that is 76% of the national retail tariff as recommended in EDL\u2019s tariff study. \nSales revenue is based on demand forecast per customer category and reflects a planned \nincrease in retail tariffs from 2009 to 2016. \n \nTable A9.1: Tariff Table (Project Area) \n(constant prices) \nItem  Unit   2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016 \nResidential tariff  (KN/kWh)  502  555  597  628  647  641  667  700 \n  (US cents/kWh)  5.88  6.50  6.99  7.35  7.58  7.51  7.81  8.20 \nNon-residential  (KN/kWh)  452  499  538  565  582  577  600  631 \n   (US cents/kWh)  5.29  5.84  6.30  6.62  6.81  6.76  7.03  7.39 \nKN = Lao kip; kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n \n4.  The project\u2019s WACC is estimated to be 2.7% expressed on an after-tax basis (Table \nA9.2). The FIRR for the project is compared to the after-tax WACC to assess financial viability. \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 9  49 \nThe project is considered to be financially viable if the FIRR is equal to or greater than the \nWACC. \n \nTable A9.2: Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n(%) \n% of  Cost of Funds \nProject  Current  Tax  After Constant  Inflation \nSource of Funds  Cost  Prices  Rate  Tax  Prices  Rate  WACC \nGovernment/EDL Contributions  11.4  17.9 0.0 17.9  10.7  6.5  1.2 \nADB and the Republic of Korea  88.6  4.5 35.0 2.9  1.7  1.2  1.5 \nTotal  100.0  2.7 \n \nEDL = Electricite du Laos, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  The WACC is calculated as the weighted average of the estimated cost of equity and \ndebt used to finance the project. The cost of equity incorporated into the WACC is estimated on \nthe basis of the capital asset pricing model, which provides a methodology for estimating the \nrequired equity return as a function of the relative risk of the investment. The cost of equity is \nthe rate of return on a risk-free investment, such as government bonds, plus a risk premium \nappropriate for the project.2 The cost of debt is estimated on the basis of the assumption that \nthe proceeds of the ADB grant and the Export and Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) loan \nare relent by the government to EDL at the 4.5% annual fixed rate. EDL is assumed to bear the \nforeign exchange risk on this loan. The WACC is then calculated on the basis of the costs of \nequity and debt weighted by the inputs of each. Based on the current financing plan, the total \nADB and Korea Eximbank financing represents 88.6% of the total project cost. This includes the \nrelent proceeds of the ADB grant, presently proposed to be $20 million, and a loan from Korea \nEximbank, presently proposed to be $37.8 million equivalent. Based on this weighting of debt \nand equity, the WACC is calculated at 2.7%. \n \nD.  Results \n \n6.  The FIRR is estimated at 11.5%, which exceeds the WACC of 2.7%. Financial net \npresent value of the project is positive ($108.2 million). Therefore, the project is considered to \nbe  financially  viable.  Overall,  these  results  are  encouraging  given  the  high  proportion  of \nrelatively  low-consumption  household  consumers  and  the  relatively  high  cost  of  providing \nservices to these consumers. This is supported by substantial load growth forecast from new \nmining and industrial projects. \n \n                                                \n2  Estimating the risk-free rate and risk premium for the project is complicated by the lack of functioning debt and \nequity markets in the Lao PDR. An estimate of the risk-free rate was calculated on the basis of US dollar \ndenominated bonds issued by the Government of Viet Nam and then adjusted for the Lao PDR. Based on this \nmethodology, the risk-free rate is estimated at 11.5%. The risk premium is estimated on the basis of an analysis of \nstandard risk indicators for 81 power utilities; 64 in the United States, three publicly listed independent power \nproducers in Thailand, and 11 power utilities in other countries. Adjustments were then made to reflect the \nadditional market, tax, and country risks of the Lao PDR. Based on this methodology, the estimated cost of equity \nis 17.9% in nominal terms, which after adjusting for inflation is equivalent to a real cost of equity of 12.3%. \n ", "50   Appendix 10 \n \nRESETTLEMENT PLAN AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Project Area \n \n1.  The  project  will  construct  three  115-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines  and  two  new \nsubstations;  upgrade  other  substations;  and  develop  medium-  and  low-voltage  distribution \nnetworks in Vientiane, Phongsali, and Xaignabouli provinces. The project will also install a \nmedium-voltage distribution network for approximately 18,800 new households. This entails \nsmall conductors (wires) from the nearest substation or transformer, supported by wooden or \nconcrete poles of small (about 30 centimeters) diameter, along roads and to houses requiring \nelectrification. \n \n2.  Based  on  the  current  transmission  line  route,  physical  construction  will  involve \npermanent acquisition of a total of approximately 1,000 square meters (m2) for tower footprints \nfrom 28 households based on tower footprints of 36 m2 per tower. The project will require \ntemporary access roads to straining towers during line stringing.  \n \nB.  Resettlement Plan and Resettlement Framework \n3.  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the  115  kV  transmission  lines  and  new \nsubstations, and a resettlement framework for the distribution network. The resettlement plan \nwill need to be updated after detailed design to ensure impacts are properly addressed and that \ncompensation methods and rates are appropriate at that time. Resettlement plans will need to \nbe  prepared for the medium-voltage  distribution facilities  in  accordance  with  the  approved \nresettlement framework. \n \n4.  The overriding principle of the resettlement plan and resettlement framework is that \nwhere a person or group is affected by land acquisition, damage to income-generating assets \nand activities or resettlement as a result of the project, compensation will be allocated so that \nlivelihoods  are  the  same  or  better  than  before  the  project.  The  entitlement  matrix,  and \nresettlement policies and procedures set out in this resettlement plan reflect this principle. \n \nC.  Legal Framework \n \n5.  The resettlement plan was prepared for the project in accordance with the requirements \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Operations \nManual  section  on  involuntary  resettlement.1 The  plan  also  complies  with  the  laws  of  the \nGovernment of the Lao PDR comprising (i) Constitution of the Lao PDR, 1991; (ii) Decree \n192/PM  on  Compensation  and  Resettlement  of  People  Affected  by  Development  Projects, \n2005;  and  (iii)  associated  government  policies,  practices,  and  technical  guidelines  in  the \nRegulation on Resettlement and Compensation, 2005. Also relevant are the Lao PDR Land \nLaw, 1997; the Forestry Law, 1996; the Electricity Act 2049, 1992; and the Electricity Law, 1997. \nADB policy provisions apply wherever gaps exist. \n \nD.  Entitlements \n \n6.  Project entitlements are designed to provide for compensation and rehabilitation for lost \nland, assets, infrastructure, resources, income sources, and services, using the principle of \nreplacement  cost  so that  affected  people  will  be  at  least  as  well-off after  the  project.  No \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006. Involuntary Resettlement. Operations Manual. OM F2. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \ndifferentiation will be made between people with and without legal title to land. All affected \npeople who are identified in the project-impacted areas on the cut-off date will be entitled to \ncompensation for their affected assets. The detailed entitlement matrix illustrates the type of \nlosses, entitled persons, entitlements, and possible implementation issues (Table A10.1).  \n \nE.  Incorporation of Women, Ethnic Minorities, and Other Vulnerable Groups  \n \n7.  In updating the resettlement plan, women from affected households, including ethnic \nminority women and households headed by women, will be consulted during socioeconomic \nsurveying and the detailed measurement survey. The socioeconomic profile of the affected \npeople  and  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnicity. \nWomen's participation, especially ethnic minorities, poor women, and households headed by \nwomen will be ensured during participation and disclosure activities. Information will be provided \nin the local language and in information booklets. Where the project involves granting new land \nor replacement land for acquired land, the title of land will be in the name of both spouses.   \n \nF.  Consultation, Participation, and Disclosure \n \n8.  The resettlement plan includes measures for stakeholder participation and full disclosure \nof all information relating to the project. In addition a project information booklet prepared by \nElectricite du Laos (EDL) was distributed to affected people as part of the resettlement plan \ndisclosure. All resettlement plan updates will be fully disclosed in accordance with ADB policy. \nSuch disclosure will be undertaken orally at village meetings in each project area and project \naffected  families  will  be  provided  with  an  information  booklet  outlining  the  methods  for \nmeasurement  of  losses,  detailed  asset  valuations,  entitlements  and  special  provisions, \ngrievance procedures, timing of payments, and displacement. \n \nG.  Grievance Redress Mechanism \n \n9.  The project implementation unit and EDL field offices will establish and maintain ongoing \ninteraction with the affected people and communities to identify problems and undertake timely \nremedial actions. Formal district and provincial grievance redress committees will be created \nand include representatives of local institutions, organizations, nongovernment organizations, \nwomen\u2019s unions, and community-based organizations.  \n \n10.  If a complainant is not satisfied with a grievance redress committee's determination, they \nmay take the matter to EDL and Water Resources and Environment Administration head offices \nand, if necessary, to court to resolve the matter. A detailed grievance procedure is in place and \nthe project will cover all administrative and legal costs incurred relating to the grievance redress \nprocedures. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Executing Agency \n \n11.  EDL has an environmental office in its technical department. This department has two \nsections covering environment and social, and a total of 11 staff, one of whom is primarily \nresponsible  for  resettlement  planning.  This  office  is  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of \norganizations  involved  in  resettlement  including  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans,  and \nsupervision and management of resettlement plan implementation. The environmental office will \nwork in close conjunction with the project implementation unit. \n ", "52   Appendix 10 \n \n \n  2.  Local and Provincial Authorities  \n \n12.  Resettlement  committees  will  be  established  in  provinces  and  districts.  District \ncommittees assume the key role in assisting the project in various resettlement planning and \nimplementation activities, while provincial committees focus on ensuring consistent application \nof the approved resettlement plan in the province. This is the same process being used for the \nADB-funded Northern Area Rural Power Distribution Project2 and other projects in the Lao PDR. \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n \n13.  EDL proposes to use a turnkey contract to deliver the project. All resettlement activities \nwill be coordinated with the civil works schedule, so that adequate time will be planned for \nresettlement  activities  to  be  satisfactorily  implemented  before  the  commencement  of \nconstruction. ADB will not approve physical works affecting affected peoples until resettlement \nactivities  are  satisfactorily  completed  and  agreed  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in  place. \nResettlement implementation will not commence until ADB has reviewed and approved the \nresettlement plan. A detailed schedule is included in the full resettlement plan included as a \nsupplementary appendix to this report. \n \n  4.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n14.  The resettlement plan will be monitored by the Vientiane-based and district-based EDL \nproject teams and the project implementation consultant, who will be required to have extensive \nsocioeconomic  monitoring  experience.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  using \ndisaggregated  indicators  so  that  impacts  on women,  and  ethnic minorities,  can  be  clearly \nunderstood and acted upon. The Vientiane-based EDL project team will be responsible for \ndetermining if any follow-up actions are necessary and ensuring these actions are undertaken. \nThe Water Resources and Environment Administration will conduct its own monitoring of the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impact, as required under Lao legislation. Monitoring will be \ncarried out for the duration of resettlement plan implementation and for an appropriate period \nafter commissioning of the project until the objectives of the resettlement plan are achieved. \nADB will receive quarterly monitoring reports and key aspects will be followed up during review \nmissions. \n \n5.  Budget Estimates \n \n15.  The current budget estimate to cover the resettlement plan implementation costs is \n$363,720, comprising permanent acquisition ($3,849), easement fee ($220,866), temporary use \nof  land  ($4,645),  consultation  and  dissemination  ($29,160),  monitoring  ($14,500),  HIV  and \nhuman trafficking mitigation ($30,000), contingency ($60,620). \n \n16.  EDL will finance the costs for land acquisition and resettlement. EDL is committed to \nproviding  funds  for  necessary  updates  to  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  preparation  of \nresettlement plans as required, and to implement the resettlement plan(s) in an efficient and \ntimely manner during the course of the project. \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2003.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy under its 6th National Socio-Economic Development Plan reaffirms that \nreducing poverty and accelerating the pace of social development are the most important long-term strategic goals. Its 5-year \nplan agenda for poverty reduction includes a concentrated effort to develop the poorest areas through a range of targeted \ninterventions. The project is located in the poor northern region, which is a focus of poverty reduction efforts under the 6th \nplan. The main pillars of the Lao national strategy for power development include (i) maintaining and expanding an \naffordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply to promote economic and social development; and (ii) promoting power \ngeneration for export to provide revenues to meet the government\u2019s development objectives.   \n \nAccess to electricity is vital for poverty reduction, improvement of human life, and socioeconomic development. The \ngovernment emphasizes development of infrastructure enabling business opportunities and pro-poor development as a key \npillar of the strategy. Accordingly, the government has set the target of achieving 90% electrification of all households by \n2020 mainly through grid extension. About 50% of households are electrified in Xaignabouli province, one of the project \nareas, still lower than the national average (58%). The northern provinces are among the poorest in the Lao PDR, as over \n58% of  households are poor, compared with 4.4% in Vientiane municipality. To eradicate poverty and promote sustainable \neconomic growth, one priority measure is to increase electrification by extending transmission lines in the north. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country strategy and program for the Lao PDR promotes sustainable economic development \nthrough infrastructure investments and gives assistance to the power system with emphasis on rural electrification. Under the \nproject, grid expansion and distribution lines provide opportunities for rural electrification, and employment generation in the \nproject areas. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: TI - Geographic \n1.  Key Issues  \nExpansion of the power transmission grid and rural electrification are crucial for development in the Lao PDR. Presently only \n58% of households have access to electricity, which is one of the lowest electrification rates in Southeast Asia. The 115 \nkilovolt (kV) system of Electricite du Lao (EDL) is fragmented and does not cover the whole country. Outside the grid, rural \nhouseholds must rely on expensive import, off-grid power supply, or do without. Expensive energy hinders rural development \nand exacerbates the rural\u2013urban income gap. Poverty is high with 29% living below the national line of $1.50 a day and nearly \n77% on less than $2 a day. The Poverty Reduction Fund (January 2007) defines households as being poor if they have an \nincome of less than KN85,000 per person per month. The project is designed with special focus to geographically target the \nnorthern provinces with high incidence of poverty. The project will include remote communities of these provinces for grid \nconnection. Twenty-nine percent of all households in project areas are poor.  \n \nThe northern provinces have experienced an annual rate of poverty reduction of 2.1%, compared to Vientiane municipality at \n13.9%. In addition to isolation, lack of education is a contributing factor to poverty. Under the project, 18,800 households \n(among them 6,000 poor households) will be supplied with grid electricity. The project will support the government\u2019s effort to \nprovide all households in the country with electricity by 2020 as part of rural infrastructure provision in the government\u2019s 6th \nNational Socio-Economic Development Plan. The household electrification rate in the main project area (Phongsali and \nXaignabouli provinces) will increase from 39% today to 79% by 2020. New small businesses, district commerce, and \nindustries in Phongsali and Xaignabouli provinces will also be provided with reliable electricity supply. The project outcome \nwill be increased access to electricity not only by households but also by small commercial, district, and industrial customers. \nThe project is expected to contribute to poverty reduction in the northern provinces through investment in economic \ndevelopment,  industrialization,  and  employment  generation.  The  provision  of  electricity  to  households  would  improve \nsocioeconomic and living standards in high-poverty geographic areas. Electricity distribution will benefit all ethnic groups \nequally in terms of access.  \n \n2. Design Features \nThe cost of connecting the distribution drop-down to a house is approximately KN700,000. Most poor households in rural \nareas have difficulty meeting this cost. The project will provide poor households with a free meter (3/9 A) and a credit of \nKN700,000 to connect their houses. The project is expected to reach 80% of poor households in the project area. It will \n ", "56   Appendix 11 \n \ninclude community information dissemination consultations to provide households with information on the project\u2019s pro-poor \nactivity.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe project area is divided into three modules. Module 1 is the Nohai\u2013Paklay\u2013Kentho component located in eastern Vientiane \nand Xaignabouli provinces. Module 2 is the Paklay\u2013Xayabury component located in Xaignabouli province. Module 3 is the \nNamo\u2013Boun Nua component situated in Oudomxai and Phongsali provinces. The project area includes 27 ethnic groups and \nsubgroups. The social analysis indicates that for a majority of the households in the project area farming and livestock are \nimportant sources of livelihood. \n \nThe module 1 project area has a population of 23,317 and is notable for a large percentage (41%) of ethnic minority Hmong \n(Hmong-Mien) and Khmou (Austro-Asiatic). The average percentage of household expenditure on energy for those with \naccess to grid electricity was 5%; nonconnected households with lower mean incomes spend 12%. The nonconnected \nhouseholds use batteries and generators to meet household energy needs, which is costly. Similarly the socioeconomic data \ndemonstrates that the project would provide considerable potential to benefit households whose total energy expenditure \ncould easily be replaced in terms of affordability by grid electricity, which in real terms would result in more energy for the \nsame expenditure. Social and poverty assessment of households in the project area indicates that households without grid \nconnection use electricity (using rechargeable battery and generator) for household purposes such as lighting, television, and \nwater pump.  \n \nThe project\u2019s social analysis shows that 47% of respondents rank electricity as their first priority. Electricity is perceived as a \ncontributing factor for improving living conditions and enhancing learning opportunities for children. At present kerosene \nprovides a significant source of lighting; health problems related to its use are a concern. Access to electricity will increase \naccess to information technology, and utilization of electric equipment and computers in schools and health facilities. This \nwould result in improved education and health services. Street lighting will contribute to a safer night environment in villages.  \nThe construction of a substation for a transmission line will engage workers; this can pose potential risk of HIV and human \ntrafficking in the campsites and surrounding villages. The construction contractors will undertake an awareness-raising \ncampaign to minimize risk of HIV and human trafficking in and around campsites. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Participants at a workshop conducted in March 2007 discussed the social and environmental impacts of the project, and \nthe resettlement plan. They included representatives of the Lao National Commission for Advancement of Women, the Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union, the Centre for HIV/AIDS and STDs (Ministry of Health), the Ministry of Energy and Mines, Department of \nElectricity, Environment Department, the EDL Environment and Resettlement Department, the Ethnic Minorities Department, \nLao National Front for Construction, the Water Resource of Environmental Agency, and the Project and Cooperation Division \nof the Department of Forestry.  \n \nThe project resettlement plan includes a gender strategy and ethnic minority specific actions, which will facilitate participation \nof the affected households in a detailed measurement survey, and discussion on land acquisition and compensation. The \nproject will disseminate information about provision of free electricity meters to poor households during the consultation with \npoor households. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nNo  C&P  plan  was  prepared.  However  consultation  will be  carried  out  by  the  resettlement  committee  during  project \nimplementation. Expenses are already included in the resettlement plan. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nGender analysis of the project shows that most of women in the project area are engaged in farming, and 20% are operating \nsmall businesses from home. Eight percent of households are headed by women. Social assessment indicates that lack of \nelectricity in the project area is a constraint for women's household work, improved living conditions, and children's education. \nThe increase in access to electricity will reduce domestic drudgery of women through use of appliances such as electric water \npumps, rice cookers, grinders, and food processing equipment, and would have a positive impact on poor women's daily \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \nhousehold work. The safer environment at night will have a positive impact on women's mobility.  \nThe negative impact of the project relates to land acquisition and potential risk of HIV and human trafficking. The number of \nworkers during construction can pose potential risk of HIV and trafficking of women. Land acquisition for the project may have \nsome minor impacts on women's work that contributes to family subsistence. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nThe following specific measures are incorporated in the project to maximize benefit of the project to women: \n  \n-  consult women from affected households, including ethnic minority households and households headed by women \nduring the detailed measurement survey to update the resettlement plan; \n-  disaggregate the socioeconomic profile of the affected people and detailed measurement survey by gender and \nethnicity; \n-  ensure women's participation, especially ethnic minority, poor women, and households headed by women in \ndisclosure meetings;  \n-  provide information in local language as well as with information booklets; \n-  ensure participation of Lao village women's union representatives in the disclosure meeting and planning of \nresettlement activities; \n-  where the project involves granting new land or replacement land for acquired land, provide the land title in the name \nof both spouses;   \n-  provide EDL staff with an orientation for a gender and resettlement checklist of ADB to ensure that gender strategy is \nimplemented in resettlement activities; \n-  under the project activity on free electricity connection to poor households, provide village consultations to ensure \nthat all poor women, ethnic minority women, and the Lao Women's Union participate in the consultation;  \n-  ensure that households headed by women and ethnic minority households and poor households receive free \nelectricity connection to their houses;  \n-  ensure that an adequate number of women are employed in the new project implementation unit; \n-  ensure that the HIV and human trafficking program is targeted to women from villages surrounding the construction \ncamps and women sex workers; \n-  develop gender-disaggregated monitoring indicators to monitor resettlement activities in terms of women's \nparticipation in the consultation for the detailed management survey, disclosure meeting, land titling, and \ncompensation, and to measure the impact of resettlement on poor women, and ethnic minority women; and \n-  develop disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender, income, and ethnicity to monitor free grid connection to \nhouseholds headed by women, poor households, and ethnic minority households. \n \nIII.
