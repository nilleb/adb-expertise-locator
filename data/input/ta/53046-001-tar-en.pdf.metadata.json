The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the governments of the \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  promote \nevidence-based policy design on small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development by (i) \ndemonstrating a country and regional index using a multivariate analytical approach, which will \nbe accessed by the DMCs; and (ii) providing a comparative country data platform, which will cover \nfinancial and nonfinancial aspects of SME development in the DMCs and will be updated \nperiodically. The TA will also help ADB operations formulate new ideas for SME projects by using \ninnovative approaches through pilot project proposals that will be discussed in the Asia SME \nMonitor, an ADB annual publication. \n  \n2.  The TA supports the elaboration and expansion of the prior Asia SME Monitor projects \n(phases 1 and 2)1 and the resultant publications. This will enhance the Asia SME Monitor\u2019s \nusefulness and create the basis for its annual issuance with an open data portal as a key resource \non SME development policies in Asia and the Pacific. The Asia SME Monitors issued in 2014 and \n2015 were knowledge products supporting SME development in the region, especially focusing \non access to finance. The issues reviewed various country aspects of SME finance, including \nbanking, nonbank sectors, and national policy actions, covering 20 DMCs from the five ADB \nregions. The TA will upgrade the prior Asia SME Monitor initiatives by extending analytical \ncoverage to nonfinancial issues on SME development and introducing the Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprise Development Index (SME-DI) that comprehensively measures various issues \naffecting SME development at the national and regional levels.  \n \n3.  Through the TA, the TA team will help implement ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 objectives: \ncontributing  to  creating  quality  jobs,  promoting  rural  development,  and  fostering  regional \ncooperation and integration.2 Support for SMEs is critical towards achieving these objectives. The \nTA will strengthen ADB\u2019s value addition by providing operationally relevant practical knowledge, \nand partnerships with centers of excellence. The TA is consistent with the 2019 annual work plan \nfor the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD), which anticipates \nproviding  knowledge  solutions  under  the  One  ADB  approach.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the \nOperational  Plan  for  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration,  2016-2020,  especially  with \noperational  direction  2  (raising  competitiveness  in  connected  markets).3 Support  for  SME \ndevelopment is also critical for regional financial cooperation.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Continuous economic growth in Asia and the Pacific has helped alleviate poverty and \nallowed a number of countries to transform into middle-income economies. Although developing \nAsia shows robust gross domestic product growth (6.0% in 2018 and expected to reach 5.8% in \n20195), global economic uncertainty, exaggerated by trade tensions and protectionist measures, \nhas increased the downside risks to the region\u2019s growth. Potential slower growth requires \n                                                \n1  ADB 2015.

Manila.   \n \n ", "2 \nimplementation of a new model that minimizes the adverse impact but maximizes opportunities \nand benefits from changing external circumstances to create a resilient base at the national level. \nIt is at this level where SMEs play a more central role in promoting sustainable economic growth \nin Asia. \n \n5.  SMEs are a driving force of Asia\u2019s economies, accounting on average for 96% of all \nenterprises and 62% of the national labor force in developing Asia. Their contribution to the growth \nmomentum, however, is limited at 42% of each country\u2019s gross domestic product on average in \nthe region.6 Economic expansion in Asia has the potential to create a foundation of growth-\noriented SMEs that contribute to boosting national productivity. Such a foundation has not yet \nmaterialized in most of the DMCs because of a number of factors, such as a lack of SME access \nto appropriate markets and finance. While growth in Asia has created a group of high net worth \nindividuals with ample capital available and interest in investment opportunities that support new \nand innovative businesses, several factors including policy matters and the lack of venues for \ninvestment make it difficult for them to find suitable SMEs to invest in.  \n \n6.  SME development is a key policy agenda toward inclusive growth in most DMCs. The \ndesign of SME policies has become more challenging because of the complexity of the SME \nbusiness environment and the rapidly changing external environment. For instance, the Fourth \nIndustrial  Revolution,7 represented  by  emerging  technologies  such  as  artificial  intelligence, \nrobotics, and the \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IOT)8, has been dramatically changing Asia\u2019s business \nenvironment and influencing how SMEs operate. While this may have the negative impact of \nreducing the workforce, mainly from large and established firms, it can create more viable SME \nbases, especially technology-based SMEs that support the creation of more quality jobs and \nattract more investments. Technology, as an enabler of innovation, is a key survival tool for \ngrowth-oriented SMEs including start-up companies. DMC governments will need to monitor \nchanging  business  climates  so  that  they  can  design  enforceable  policy  support  for  SME \ndevelopment.  \n \n7.  Foreign direct investment inflows to Asia, which have been sharply increasing since the \n2007\u20132008 global financial crisis, also bring business opportunities for SMEs.9 Increased entry of \nlarge multinational firms into developing Asia creates new demands for domestic products and \nservices from SMEs\u2014typically in supporting industries or for parts and components suppliers\u2014\nand accordingly will improve labor productivity if SMEs actively participate in global value chains. \nGlobal value chains bring several benefits to SMEs: increased competitiveness, enhanced \nproduct quality by technology transfer, business expansion, and job creation. To promote SMEs\u2019 \nparticipation in global value chains, DMC governments will need to better understand the regional \nand  global  SME  business  landscape  and  neighboring  countries\u2019  policy  practices  through \nstrengthened regional cooperation and integration. \n \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2015. Asia SME Finance Monitor 2014. Manila.  \n7   According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s definition (2018), a Fourth Industrial Revolution is an age in which \nscientific  and  technological  breakthroughs  are  disrupting  industries,  blurring  geographical  boundaries,  and \nchallenging existing regulatory frameworks. \n8    An IOT refers to sensors and actuators connected by networks to software. IOT systems can monitor and manage \nconnected objectives, machines, and even living things. Mckinsey&Company. 2017.  How can we recognize the \nreal power of the Internet of Things?. Paris. \n9   Foreign direct investment net inflows to east Asia and the Pacific (excluding high-income economies) was $239.6 \nbillion in 2017, a 9% increase from 2016 (World Development Indicators, World Bank). Although the pace for \nincreasing capital inflows has been slowing recently, capital flows from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and \nthe Republic of Korea have resulted in accelerated intraregional foreign direct investment. \n ", "3 \n8.  The  liberalized  trade  and  investment  brought  about  by  economic  integration  and \nexpansion and the advent of advanced technologies will promote the structural changes needed \nfor the SME business model, allowing it to move from being domestically focused to being globally \ncompetitive. This shift requires new policy solutions for emerging growth-oriented SMEs. A rapidly \nchanging external environment, as accelerated by the Fourth Industrial Revolution and foreign \ndirect investment inflows, will create more opportunities for SME business in developing Asia, but \nappropriate design of policy support is needed for such opportunities to materialize. DMC \ngovernments  are  seeking  timely  access  to  high-quality  multicountry  analytical  data  and \nneighboring countries\u2019 good practices on SME development so that they can effectively assess \nand implement enforceable SME policies. ADB is in the best position to provide such data and \npolicy  advice,  given  its  expertise  in  this  area  and  the  extent  of  projects  supporting  SME \ndevelopment across the region. \n \n9.  The DMC governments and ADB operations have a strong demand for the continuous \ndelivery of multicountry SME data from ADB with periodic updates, as indicated in the client \nsatisfaction surveys after previous Asia SME Monitor projects.10 Participating DMCs were highly \nsatisfied with the Asia SME Monitor, stating that it facilitates their effective policy design on SME \ndevelopment, encourages data harmonization across countries, and promotes common policy \ndiscussions on SMEs at the regional and global levels. ADB staff who participated in the surveys \nalso indicated the usefulness of the Asia SME Monitor in the design of SME-related projects.   \n \n10.  Besides the Asia SME Monitor, there are several global SME data initiatives, but there are \nlimitations with data coverage and methodology. For instance, the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development has issued an SME scoreboard annually since 2011, focusing on \nbank credit and nonbank finance in 43 countries. However, it covers only five ADB DMCs (the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Thailand), and each country \npaper is only a two-page data summary. The International Finance Corporation has issued an ad \nhoc report on the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises finance gap, covering 128 countries \nincluding 29 ADB DMCs. However, the data for calculating financing gaps are based on survey \nfindings, and available data items are limited. The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and \nEast Asia has issued the ASEAN SME Policy Index in collaboration with the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development, providing six scale ratings to eight policy dimensions \nbased on descriptive analysis. This report, however, does not deliver country SME data. The DMC \ngovernments often utilize the World Bank Doing Business Report to measure the effectiveness of \nthe  enabling  business  environment  for  SMEs  in  developing  Asia,  but  the  report  uses  a \nstandardized SME definition not linked to country definitions. This suggests that it may not always \nreflect the actual condition of SMEs in the countries. The Asia SME Monitor will avoid duplication \nwith existing SME data initiatives but add value to such initiatives through close collaboration and \npartnerships with DMCs.  \n \n11.  Through the TA, the TA team will upgrade the Asia SME Monitor by strengthening its \nglobal reach and comparability to make it a benchmark on SME policy discussions in Asia and \nthe Pacific. Following the direction of Strategy 2030, the TA team will focus on producing \noperationally relevant knowledge products, including pilot project proposals and a comparative \nindex on SME development. The TA team will also develop knowledge cooperation with centers \nof excellence such as the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to strengthen the quality of \nanalysis. The long interval since the last Asia SME Monitor was launched in 2015 will not \n                                                \n10   ADB. 2016.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: private-sector-led economic growth promoted \nthrough the expansion of viable SME bases in DMCs. The TA will have the following outcome: \nSME business environment improved through enhanced evidence-based policy making on SME \ndevelopment in DMCs. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  The proposed TA has three outputs: (i) SME-DI designed, (ii) pilot projects supporting \nSME development operations identified, and (iii) upgraded edition of Asia SME Monitor delivered. \nThe TA will contribute to strengthening the connection among knowledge, finance, and technology \nin close collaboration with DMC governments, ADB operations departments, and knowledge \npartners. \n \n14.  Output 1: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Index designed. The TA \nteam will design and test the SME-DI to measure two dimensions affecting SME development in \nthe DMCs: (i) finance areas including banking, nonbank sectors, capital markets, public financing, \nfinancial infrastructure, technology adoption (financial technology or digital financial services \nsolutions), and finance policies and regulations; and (ii) nonfinance areas including firm size, \nemployment (skilled labor and gender), business productivity, market access, technology (e-\ncommerce and innovation), management and capacity of SMEs, external support (incubators and \nbusiness development services), networking, and SME development policies and regulations. \nThe SME-DI will introduce a multivariate analytical approach based on available country data, \nsupplementary surveys, and social and academic databases to comprehensively measure the \nlevel of SME development in participating DMCs and the five ADB regions. The TA strategically \ntargets countries from ASEAN for the Asia SME Monitor to be launched in 2020 and will expand \nthe country coverage in 2021 and after.12 The TA team will decide the selection of countries \nthrough close consultation with ADB operations departments and DMCs, and demonstrate the \npilot SME-DI in the planned Asia SME Monitor in 2020, which ADB will develop in partnership \nwith ADBI and ESCAP. \n \n15.  Output  2:  Pilot  projects  supporting  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise \ndevelopment operations identified. The TA team will identify at least two innovative knowledge \nsolutions supporting SME development, in close consultation with ADB operations departments \nand DMCs. ADBI and ESCAP, as knowledge partners, will also contribute to identifying such \nsolutions. The Asia SME Monitor will demonstrate these solutions in its thematic chapter. ADB \noperations departments will accept at least two pilot projects using identified knowledge solutions \nfor future work plans and project proposal discussions under various ADB country partnership \n                                                \n11   ADB has discussed with the ASEAN Working Committee on Financial Inclusion the data collection process of the \nAsia SME Monitor since February 2019.  \n12  The Asia SME Monitor 2014 covered 20 DMCs: (i) Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan (Central Asia); \n(ii) the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, and Mongolia (East Asia); (iii) Bangladesh, India, and Sri \nLanka (South Asia); (iv) Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the \nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam (Southeast Asia); and (v) Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands \n(Pacific). \n ", "5 \nstrategies. The TA team will establish a consultative group on the Asia SME Monitor to discuss \nthemes for pilot project case studies, select candidate DMCs, and evaluate the findings from the \nAsia SME Monitor on a regular basis. The ERCD\u2013Financial Cooperation and Integration team \nand the Regional Cooperation and Integration Thematic Group of the Sustainable Development \nand Climate Change Department will organize the consultative group, members of which will be \nwidely sought from ADB operations departments and sector and/or thematic groups.     \n \n16.  Output 3: Upgraded edition of Asia Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Monitor \ndelivered. The TA team will publish three volumes of the Asia SME Monitor as an annual \nperiodical. The upgraded Asia SME Monitor has three components: (i) a regional review chapter \ndemonstrating the result of the SME-DI, (ii) a thematic case discussion chapter addressing \ninnovative knowledge solutions on SME development useful for ADB operations, and (iii) a \ncountry review chapter analyzing financial and nonfinancial issues in SME development in \nparticipating DMCs. To collect reliable and accurate data with periodic updates, the TA will build \nstrategic partnerships on data sharing with key DMC institutions that hold SME data such as SME \nagencies, relevant line ministries, statistics offices, central banks, financial authorities, and SME \nbanks. The TA team will organize at least three dissemination seminars (Asia SME Monitor book \nlaunch) in selected DMCs and/or ADB headquarters. The TA team will also conduct at least six \ntraining programs on SME development and access to finance for DMC governments and relevant \nstakeholders, based on the findings from the Asia SME Monitor and pilot project case studies. \nThe TA team will share internally and disclose to the public collected data and analyses authorized \nby partner DMC institutions through the Asia SME Monitor Online, an open data portal. The Asia \nSME Monitor in 2020 will initially target ASEAN countries and will be expanded in 2021 and after, \nwith  consideration  for  the  demand  from  DMCs  and  after  consulting  with  ADB  operations \ndepartments. The Asia SME Monitor defines SMEs according to the national classification by law \nor by policy guidelines adopted in participating DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,600,000, of which (i) $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6), and (ii) $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. Staff in the Office of the \nChief Economist and Director General of ERCD will play leading roles in the Asia SME Monitor. \nThey will also serve as resource persons in field discussions with DMCs whose mission costs will \nbe financed by the TA. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  June 2019\u2013May 2022 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nImplementing agency  Office of the Chief Economist and Director General, Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB \nConsultantsa  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual selection  International expertise  $527,000 \n(31 person-months) \nIndividual selection  National expertise   $186,000 \n ", "6 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(62 person-months) \n  Quality-based selection  Consulting firm   $450,000 \n(15 person-months) \nProcurementb  To be procured by consultants or executing agency \nShopping  3 contracts  $9,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \na Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3).  \nb Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.

ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project \nadministration instructions and/or staff instructions.13  \n \n20.  Knowledge cooperation. The deliverables from knowledge partners, i.e., ADBI and \nESCAP, will focus on the methodological development and implementation of the planned SME-\nDI (output 1) and application of identified knowledge solutions for operations (output 2). ADBI\u2019s \nactivities are aligned with ADB\u2019s strategic focus, which includes poverty reduction and inclusive \neconomic growth, regional cooperation and integration, and private sector development and \noperations. ESCAP is the regional development arm of the United Nations for the Asia\u2013Pacific \nregion, whose support focuses on areas including macroeconomic policy, poverty reduction, and \nfinancing for development. The knowledge cooperation with partner institutions does not include \nthe transfer of funds for full ADB administration.  \n \n21.  Pilot testing of project approach. The scope of pilot testing covers challenges and \nopportunities affecting SME development and access to finance in DMCs, and helping ADB \noperations formulate new ideas for SME projects. ADB as the executing agency will coordinate \nthe selection of the pilot project case studies and the participating DMCs in consultation with ADB \noperations departments. The activities will not result in any potential adverse environmental \nand/or social impacts. The TA team will prepare the details of the pilot project during TA \nimplementation. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s procurement. ADB will subscribe to databases and purchase software necessary \nto implement the SME-DI, field surveys, and the pilot project case studies. The procurement \nmethod will be shopping, with three contracts. Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  Social media and websites. Timely updates of the Asia SME Monitor Online are an \nintegral part of its function. The TA team will explore arrangements for website maintenance \nbefore the closing of the project, if the demand on such open data portals persists. \n                                                \n13 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "7 \n \nE.
