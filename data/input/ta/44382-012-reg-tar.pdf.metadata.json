Justification \n1.  The  proposed  Pacific  Regional  Information  and  Communication  Technology  (ICT) \nConnectivity Project is to support Solomon Islands and possibly other Pacific developing member \ncountries in developing a submarine fibre optic cable to provide cheap, high capacity international \nbandwidth  solution.  Improved  services  and  lower  cost  of  international  connectivity  through \nsubmarine cable will stimulate competition and increase demand for broadband Internet. In turn, \nthis will lower the cost of retail telecommunications services, especially broadband internet.  \n \n2.  Rapid technological changes, volatile business environment, regulatory environment, and \nthe nature of cross-border infrastructure can create commercial and sovereign risks for the cable \ndevelopment. In addition, any environmental and social issues that may arise from the cable \ndevelopment and operation should be thoroughly assessed and management plans should be \nprepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statements and other co-financiers\u2019 requirements. The \nproposed project preparation technical assistance (PPTA) will prepare analyses and inputs required \nto inform stakeholders\u2019 decision, facilitate stakeholder dialogue, and assist stakeholders in key \nnegotiations.  \n \n3.  The World Bank has already mobilized consultants (i) to conduct a feasibility study and (ii) to \nexamine the regulatory environment and any necessary regulatory actions for the proposed cable \nconstruction and operation. These consultants will review and provide independent advice to a \nbusiness plan as well as technical and legal documents once those documents are ready. The \nproposed  PPTA  will  fill  the  gap  in  stakeholder  capacity  by  providing  more  on-site  technical \nassistance while the World Bank consultants provide independent reviews of the outputs from the \nstakeholders.  More  specifically,  the  PPTA  will  assist  the  steering  committee  in  (i)  facilitating \nstakeholder dialogue and building their commitments; (ii) developing a detailed business plan; (iii) \nexploring private sector interest in equity and debt financing; (iv) advising the establishment of cable \ndevelopment and operating company; (v) completing required due diligence activities; and (vi) \npreparing implementation plans and key documents.  \n \n4.  The proposed PPTA will also make some resources available for other potential project \npreparation activities by the Pacific developing member countries upon receipt of request of the \ngovernments. In Vanuatu, a private sector sponsor has proposed a submarine cable link to Fiji, and \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been discussing a possible debt financing. The \nPalau National Communications Corporation is developing a business case for a submarine cable \nto Guam possibly linking Yap, Federated States of Micronesia. They will be seeking debt financing \nand are interested in ADB's participation either technically, financially or both. The proposed PPTA \ncan support the governments in selected areas (e.g., environmental and social assessments) by \nextending the consulting services hired under the PPTA. This approach can reduce time and costs \nof hiring specialized consulting services for the other countries, thus allowing ADB to provide timely \nassistance.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n5.  The  key  objective  of  the  PPTA  is  to  assist  the  Governments  and  ADB  in  preparing \nnecessary inputs for the project preparation. Major outputs include (i) sector analysis; (ii) a detailed \nbusiness plan; (iii) a report on potential investors; (iv) draft bidding documents; (v) social and \nenvironmental assessment reports and management plans; (vi) governance risk assessment and ", "2 \n \nmanagement plan; and (vii) a gender, social, and poverty analysis.
