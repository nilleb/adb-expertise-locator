INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the capacity of North \nPacific developing member countries (DMCs)1 to assess and improve the responses to future \nexternal shocks. The TA will examine the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic\u2019s \neffects on the flow of external resources (remittances and foreign direct investment [FDI]); \ndemographics, including outmigration; and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and \npropose actions to mitigate future shocks. Outcomes are linked to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Strategy 2030, Operational Priority 6.1 and Sustainable Development Goals 1.5 and 8.1.2 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2020 pipeline of the Pacific Regional Cooperation Operations \nBusiness Plan 2021\u20132023 and is part of ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 \nPandemic in the Pacific.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  COVID-19  poses  a  continued  risk.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  presented \nunprecedented health, social, and economic challenges requiring country, regional, and global \nintervention and collaboration to mitigate its negative effects. To date, the pandemic has resulted \nin more than 62.4 million confirmed cases and over 1.4 million fatalities worldwide.4 As fragile and \nconflict-affected situations (FCAS), the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands (RMI) struggle to deliver basic services under normal circumstances. \nPalau, while not classified as an FCAS, shares many of the same limitations. These governments \nhave worked diligently to respond effectively to COVID-19 and address the health and economic \nimpact of the pandemic, but the effort has stretched these countries\u2019 capacity even further. While \nconfirmed cases in the North Pacific DMCs have been limited to those identified in border \nquarantine, governments have had to take a significant steps to mitigate the risk of transmission \nand make a number of policy decisions to try to protect their economies, and their citizens, from \nthe economic impact of the pandemic. The North Pacific DMCs have imposed lockdowns and \ntravel restrictions to prevent community transmission of COVID-19, and these decisions continue \nto have a widespread economic impact.  \n \n4.  Complex economic implications. As long as travel restrictions persist, the economies \nof the Pacific DMCs, particularly the smallest and least developed, will continue to be negatively \nimpacted.  Each  of  the  North  Pacific  DMCs  are  projected  to  record  successive  economic \ncontractions during FY2021 and FY2022.5  \n \na.  Federated States of Micronesia. Extended border closures amid the pandemic \nresulted in an economic contraction of 5.4% in FY2020 and is forecast to translate \nto a further 1.8% decline in FY2021. Travel and quarantine restrictions have \nprevented purse seine fishing vessels, which are required to transship their catch \noutside the reef, from docking. Transshipment output is expected to fall by more \n \n1   The North Pacific DMCs are the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \n2   Operational Priority 6.1: Improved public and corporate sector management functions and financial stability; SDG \n1.5: By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and \nvulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters; \nand SDG 8.1: Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at \nleast 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries. \n3   ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n4  World Health Organization. 2020. WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. https://covid19.who.int/ \naccessed on 1 December 2020.  \n5   ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila. \n ", "2 \nthan a third from FY2020 to FY2021. Container vessel visits have also fallen, \nespecially to the two smaller states of Yap and Kosrae. Fishing license fee \nrevenues are expected to decline from 20.6% of GDP in FY2019 to 18.0% in \nFY2020 and 16.2% in FY2021. Trade and travel restrictions are also affecting \nsmall-scale exporters of fish and other agricultural products, which are transported \nby air cargo. Further, current travel restrictions and the border closures impact the \nsupply  of  construction  materials  and  constrain  the  travel  of  skilled  workers, \nresulting in project delays (e.g., construction of PetroCorp\u2019s coconut processing \nproject in Chuuk). \n \nb.  Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands economy is estimated to have contracted \nby 5.5% in FY2020, with a further 1.4% decline projected for FY2021. Prior to the \npandemic, Majuro was the world\u2019s busiest tuna transshipment port, boosting the \ntransport services sector, while also providing ancillary services such as fish \ncontainerization, food and supplies provisioning, and net repair among others, to \n400\u2013500 purse seiners. A tuna loining plant in Majuro also contributed most of the \ntotal manufacturing output. During the early stages of global travel restrictions, \nships that have transited through COVID-19 affected countries were prohibited \nfrom entering the RMI\u2019s ports, disrupting the fisheries supply chain. A subsequent \nrequirement for fishing and carrier vessels to spend at least 14 days at sea \n(including travel) prior to entry continues to limit transshipment activity in Majuro \nport. For example, transshipment services associated with the export of sashimi-\ngrade tuna are trending lower by 50%. Estimates show that both domestic purse \nseine fishing and tuna loining operations were reduced by about 30% in FY2020 \nand are seen to remain below pre-COVID-19 levels in FY2021. Although fishing \nlicense revenues are estimated to have achieved the pre-pandemic projection of \n$30 million (14% of GDP) in FY2020, the potential adverse impact of prolonged \ntravel restrictions on demand for vessel days is projected to reduce fishing license \nfee collections by 13% in FY2021. \n \nc.  Palau. With annual tourism receipts reaching the equivalent of 40%\u201350% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP), Palau is among the most tourism-driven economies not \nonly in the Pacific but globally. However, the tourism industry has struggled in \nrecent years, though had started to show signs of recovery. From a peak of nearly \n170,000 tourists (for a tourist\u2013resident ratio of 9.5:1) in fiscal year FY2015, arrivals \ndeclined to less than 90,000 by FY2019. From October 2019 to January 2020 (the \nfirst 4 months of Palau\u2019s fiscal year), visitor arrivals were already equivalent to \n46.4% of FY2019 full-year arrivals. However, the COVID-19 pandemic saw total \narrivals fall by 53% to below 42,000 in FY2020, the fifth consecutive year of decline. \nThis drove an overall economic contraction of 13.8%. If travel remains restricted \nuntil the end of FY2021\u2014a plausible scenario if Palau opts to remain closed to \ntourism until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available\u2014annual arrivals could \nfall further, even below 10,000 during this fiscal year. This would push the economy \ninto another sharp contraction of about 13.2% in FY2021. \n \n5.   The impact of economic shocks on labor. About 1.6% of the population of the North \nPacific DMCs migrates to the United States each year under the terms of free movement in their \nrespective Compact Agreements with the United States, and it is uncertain how the COVID-19 \npandemic with the challenges in health care and weak health systems in these countries will \nimpact this outmigration going forward. While remittances can increase during crises periods such \nas the ongoing pandemic, the pandemic\u2019s severe impacts on global labor markets, if prolonged, \n ", "3 \ncan result in an overall decline in remittances through job losses for migrant workers. As of June \n2020, nearly one-third of the world\u2019s labor force (32%) were living in countries where workplace \nclosures were required (except for essential industries) and about 42% reside in countries where \nsome workplace closures are required.6 In 2019, the Republic of the Marshall Islands received \nthe highest remittances in the North Pacific in terms of GDP and per capita share.7 Inward flows \nof skilled labor also play a critical role in the north Pacific, being essential to support infrastructure \ninvestments which are an important driver of growth in both FSM and RMI. Such projects are \nexpected to be delayed because of ongoing travel restrictions on workers. \n \n6.  Multisectoral coordination critical.  An effective response to any significant economic \nshock,  including  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  requires  a  well-informed  multisector  approach. \nMinistries responsible for agriculture, finance, health, small business, social protection, and trade, \nneed to work together, along with the private sector and civil society organizations, to collectively \ndevelop  and  deliver  on  policy  responses.  Mechanisms  for  effective  whole  of  government \ncoordination  are  weak  in  the  North  Pacific,  while  the  communication  channels  between \ngovernment and the private sector and civil society are not well developed.  \n \n7.  Data for decision making lacking. In responding to COVID-19, governments across the \nPacific have struggled in understanding the full extent of adverse impacts due to data and \ninformation gaps. Filling in these gaps\u2014particularly in the areas of possible demographic shifts, \noutmigration and remittances trends, and patterns of business activity as reflected in inflows of \nforeign direct investment and registrations of small and medium enterprises, among others\u2014can \nhelp  governments  better  target  social  assistance  measures  toward  the  most  vulnerable \nhouseholds and businesses that most need support during economic downturns or crisis periods. \nOver the longer-term, improved data gathering and analysis will help strengthen evidence-based \npolicymaking toward more responsive governance and efficient public service delivery.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: readiness of the North Pacific DMCs to \nrespond to COVID-19 and future shocks improved.8 The TA will have the following outcome: \nenhanced knowledge and awareness to improve policy responses to future economic shocks in \nin the North Pacific DMCs.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Assessments  of  the  policy  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic \nconducted. The response of each of these three DMCs to the economic shock of COVID-19 will \nbe reviewed with a view to drawing lessons for future such events and identifying areas of \nweaknesses and proposing actions for strengthening the response and planning for recovery. \n \n6   International Labour Organization. 2020.

Output 2: Data collected on key economic indicators for future shocks. The TA will \nwork with relevant ministries and/or agencies, to collect statistical and administrative data critical \nto decision making and which has been identified as lacking.10 This may include data in areas \nsuch as demographics (including outmigration), remittances, foreign direct investment, and small \nand medium size enterprises, which are currently weak in the North Pacific DMCs. The TA will \nalso propose mechanisms to sustain regular collection of the data. The TA will present its findings \nto each of the governments of the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. The TA will be implemented from March 2021 to February \n2023.
