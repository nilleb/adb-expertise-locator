In early 2006, the Royal Thai Government requested technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for capacity building of the newly established Neighbouring \nCountries Economic Development Cooperation Agency (NEDA) through discussions with NEDA \nand the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  \n2.  This  request  is considered  to  be  in  line  with the  draft  country  partnership  strategy \nbetween  Thailand  and  ADB  that  will  support  Thailand\u2019s  role  and  capacity  in  promoting \nsubregional  development  and  increase  its  contributions  to  the  global  partnership  for \ndevelopment  under  Millennium  Development  Goal  8.  ADB,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  have  closely \ncoordinated  with  NEDA  in  identifying  and  assessing  areas  for  capacity  strengthening  and \npossible assistance from ADB, AFD, and JBIC. In a brainstorming retreat on 20\u201321 April 2006 \nat Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, NEDA, ADB, and JBIC agreed to use the record of discussion \nas the primary guideline for developing capacity-building support for NEDA. \n3.  On 1 August 2006, ADB Management approved the TA concept. ADB fielded the (i) Pre-\nFact-Finding  Mission1 from  3\u20136  June  and  from  28  July\u20131  August  2006  to  consolidate \ninformation and requests from NEDA, and coordinate support with AFD and JBIC; and (ii) Fact-\nFinding Mission2 from 2\u20134 August 2006 to finalize a memorandum of understanding between \nNEDA and ADB. The memorandum of understanding, signed on 8 September 2006, reflects the \nlatest  mission  findings  and  the  understandings  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  TA \nobjectives, scope, cost, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Thailand has successfully achieved sustainable economic growth since the financial \ncrisis in 1997. Economic expansion is forecast to grow at an average annual rate of about 5% \nfrom 2006/07. During the past 3 years, economic stability has been strong and unemployment \nrates lower than 3%, while foreign reserves have risen to about $58 billion, or three times \ngreater than Thailand\u2019s short-term external debts. With robust and stable economic growth, the \nGovernment has shown a commitment to promote development in neighboring countries, based \non the strong economic, social, and cultural linkages. Poverty reduction and economic growth in \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion, for example, are closely correlated with robust growth of the \nThai economy. Strong income growth in Thailand not only expands markets and business \nopportunities  for  its  neighboring  countries,  but  allows  Thailand  to  enhance  its  subregional \nassistance to these countries.  \n5.  As the Government aims to play a more important role in subregional development, it \nestablished NEDA in May 2005 to serve as a leading government agency to channel financing \nto  neighboring  countries  in  the  form  of  concessional  loans  and  grants  for  cross-border \ndevelopment projects. The projects financed through NEDA enhance the role of Thailand as a \nregional  development  partner  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  cooperation  program, \nestablished in 1993 with ADB assistance. \n                                                 \n1  Comprising R.

Verbiest, Country \nDirector, Thailand Resident Mission. \n2  Comprising R. Nitithanprapas, External Relations Officer, TRM (Mission Leader); J.P. Verbiest, Country Director, \nTRM, and J. Lynch, Principal Programs Economist, TRM. \n ", "2   \n6.  The  need  to  build  up  NEDA\u2019s  capacity  as  an  emerging  funding  agency  has  been \ndiscussed with several development partners based in Bangkok, notably Australian Agency for \nInternational Development, European Union, France (AFD), JBIC, and World Bank. The issue \nhas also been raised in a number of senior official and ministerial meetings on the Ayayawady-\nChao  Phraya-Mekong  Economic  Cooperation  Strategy,  most  notably  at  the  latest  Senior \nOfficials Meeting and ministerial retreat in Pakse, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic on 4 July \n2006. Inside the Thai Government, the need to support NEDA has been discussed with the \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, MOF, and National Economic and Social Development Board. This \nproposed  capacity-building  activity  is  also  mentioned  in  ADB\u2019s  draft  country  partnership \nstrategy, which was extensively discussed with all major government agencies, and at a public \nconsultation meeting on 17 July 2006. \n7.  Because NEDA is a new organization, support is needed to build its technical and \nfinancial capabilities to identify, appraise, and finance complex investment projects. Additionally, \nNEDA will need to develop a management information system and other support systems for \nprocurement  and  project  management;  and  to  implement,  monitor,  and  evaluate  its \ndevelopment assistance.  \n8.  A prime example of translating Thailand's forward engagement policy into action is \ncooperation  with  neighboring  countries  through  the  Ayayawady-Chao  Phraya-Mekong \nEconomic  Cooperation  Strategy. 3 Thailand  has  also  taken  the  lead  to  expand  country \npartnerships and linkages across Asia through trade, investment, and sharing of knowledge and \nexperience.  Recently,  the  Government  clearly  positioned  itself  as  an  important  emerging \nsubregional  development  partner  by  establishing  NEDA,  a  public  organization  under  the \noversight of MOF, to provide financial and TA for neighboring countries. \n9.  As a newly established agency with no expertise in financing international projects and \nTA, NEDA is looking for capacity building from international financial institutions, including ADB. \nAFD, and JBIC. Almost all 30 NEDA staff, including a president, two vice presidents, and eight \noperational project managers, have been transferred from MOF. Although the agency benefits \nfrom  the  staff\u2019s  experience  working  at  MOF,  it  still  lacks  (i)  criteria  and  guidelines  for \ninternational  project  identification,  selection,  preparation,  and  appraisal;  and  (ii)  operations \nprocedures  for  loan  management,  including  disbursement  and  project  implementation,  and \noverall project management, monitoring, and evaluation. NEDA also needs to finalize its internal \ncontrol mechanism for the approval of project concepts, appraisal, and reporting. Since its \ncreation in May 2005, NEDA has eight ongoing projects in the Greater Mekong Subregion and \nis faced with growing demand for assistance from neighboring countries and cofinancing with \ninternational financial institutions. NEDA has a policy of tied financing using country systems for \nprocurement and safeguards; the agency can work with other international financial institutions \nin parallel cofinancing. \n10.  To strengthen NEDA capacity, ADB, AFD, and JBIC are coordinating a comprehensive \ninstitutional  and  capacity-building  program.  The  program  aims  to  provide  NEDA  with  the \nnecessary  technical,  financial,  and  institutional  skills  in  strategic  planning,  institutional \ndevelopment,  and  all  the  steps  of  the  project  cycle:  identification,  selection,  preparation, \nappraisal, approval, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. NEDA also needs specific \nprocedures  to  monitor  disbursement  and  to  manage  procurement  activities,  as  well  as  a \ncomprehensive information and communication technology (ICT) plan to support its activities.  \n                                                 \n3  The strategy was established under Thailand\u2019s leadership in 2003 and joins Thailand with Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The objective of the TA is to strengthen NEDA\u2019s capacity to effectively and efficiently \nmobilize financial resources for projects that contribute to neighboring countries' development. \nAs a newly established agency, NEDA lacks criteria and guidelines for project selection and \nappraisal, operational procedures for loan management and project implementation, as well as \nsoftware and information and technology support for project management. NEDA will need \nassistance in strengthening institutional and human resources development in these areas. \n12.  To respond to these requirements, ADB will provide individual consultants to review \nNEDA\u2019s current business model and project cycle, develop and implement a training program in \nproject operation, and optimize NEDA's organization structure to match appropriate staffing and \nlending  levels  and  the  number  of  staff.  ADB  will  validate  safeguard,  procurement,  and \ndisbursement procedures, as well as the elements and steps in the project cycle. The TA also \nincludes  an  ICT  plan;  and  the  provision  of  software  for  operational  support  for  project \nmanagement and administration. NEDA staff will participate in training programs conducted by \nADB, JBIC, and AFD on various aspects of development assistance, and in project missions \nwith the project teams of the respective banks. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  TA  is expected  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  NEDA  in  project operations and \nmanagement. The TA will have three major deliverables: (i) diagnostic report, (ii) training, and \n(iii) software.  \n14.  The  diagnostic  report  will  review  NEDA\u2019s  current  business  model  and  operations \ncovering its (i) strategic plan; (ii) organization structure, staff capacity assessment, and human \ndevelopment  plan;  (iii)  project  cycle,  including  project  identification,  preparation,  appraisal, \napproval,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  (iv)  disbursement  and  procurement \nsystem,  as  well  as  safeguard  policies;  (v)  software;  and  (vi)  ICT  plans.  The  report  will \nsummarize the needs and areas for capacity building, and propose improvement and changes \nto NEDA\u2019s organization structure, project cycle, monitoring of legal covenants, procurement \nactivities, and disbursement system. The report will provide the basis for NEDA to develop its \nown operations manual and procedures, and will validate the ICT plan as well as the project \nmanagement system, including procurement, disbursement, and internal controls.  \n15.  The training program will be defined based on the staff capacity assessment, proposed \nproject cycle, and capacity development programs proposed by AFD and JBIC. The training will \ncomprise (i) training of NEDA operations staff at ADB headquarters for an equivalent of 12 staff \nweeks; (ii) international training of NEDA key staff for an equivalent of three staff for 10 days; \n(iii) training of NEDA staff at NEDA for an equivalent of 3 to 4 weeks; and (iv) hands-on training \nof NEDA operations staff through participation in project missions with ADB, AFD, and JBIC in \nthe region. \n16.  The TA will provide some software to support operations and project management; \nNEDA  will  provide  hardware  as  counterpart  funding.  The  consultant  will  review  NEDA \nrequirements in line with operations procedures to be developed, as well as the ICT plan. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $290,000 equivalent of which $200,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. NEDA will finance $90,000 equivalent \nin-kind through the provision of computer hardware, adequate office space, and counterpart \nstaff during TA implementation. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  NEDA will be the Executing Agency and will appoint a project director from senior \nmanagement and a project coordinator from NEDA staff. NEDA and the consultant staff are to \nbe located in the same office. The consultant will provide reports in English and NEDA will \ntranslate the TA reports at its discretion into Thai language.  \n19.  The TA will be implemented for a period of eight months by individual consultants \nsupported by the project team comprising ADB staff from the (i) Learning and Development Unit \nto assist in designing training programs and the human resources development plan; (ii) Central \nOperations Service Office to review the public procurement system and procedures used in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and to confirm or propose other arrangements; and (iii) Office of \nInformation  Systems  and  Technology  to  assure  quality  control  of  hardware  and  software \nrequirements for NEDA operations.  \n20.  The TA will require about 7 person-months of international and national consultants with \ninput over 6 months starting in January 2007 and finishing in June 2007.  \n21.  The team leader is expected to be an international consultant, and provide about 4 \nperson-months of input to outline the operations systems and procedures for lending and project \nmanagement, including internal control, procurement methods, and disbursement systems. The \nhuman resources and training specialist will be an international or national consultant with \ninternational experience and will provide about 2 person-months of input: (i) about 1 month to \noutline  the  human  resources  development  plan,  including  training  requirements  and \norganizational structure; and (ii) about 1 month to provide local training. The ICT specialist will \nbe an international or national consultant with international experience, who will provide about 1 \nperson-month of input to review and optimize (i) requirements for hardware and software, \nincluding training requirement; and, (ii) specification of the software to be procured under the \nTA.  The  consultant  will  finalize  a  software  selection  matrix  for  NEDA  consideration  and \nselection.  \n22.  ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with the  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2006), as amended from time to time. The selection method will be for \nindividual  consultants  under  a  lump  sum  contract.  Software  will  be  procured  under  direct \ncontracting, since the selected software is likely to be proprietary with fixed price and available \nfrom an exclusive distributor. The software provided under the TA will be handed over at no cost \nto NEDA at the end of the TA. \n23.  Each consultant will be required to submit a report, at the end of the assignment, \ncomprising (i) outline of operations systems and procedures, including project cycle, project \nmanagement, procurement systems, disbursement monitoring, internal control, and safeguard \npolicies;  (ii)  outline  of  human  resources  development  plan,  including  training  program  and \norganization  structure;  and  (iii)  outline  of  the  ICT  plan,  including  software  and  hardware \nrequirements. The diagnostic report will be submitted and approved at the end of month 6, from \nthe beginning of the TA. An outline of the terms of reference is provided in Appendix 3. A \nproposed outline of the final report is included in Appendix 4. \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.
