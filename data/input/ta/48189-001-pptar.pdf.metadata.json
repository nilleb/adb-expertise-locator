The  government  has  identified  the  priority  areas  to  be  covered  under  the  ensuing \nproject. A PPTA is necessary to provide sound evidence to justify proceeding with the Loan \nProject.  In  accordance  with  the  relevant  Government  regulations  and  guidelines,  and  the \nagreements among the six International Development Banks it would define the scope, cost, \nprocedures  for  identifying  subprojects,  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements, \nprocurement  strategy,  technology  issues,  capacity  development  needs  and  post-project \noperation and maintenance arrangements. It is necessary to establish measures for adherence \nto the safeguard policies of both the Government and ADB. The PPTA would provide guidance \nin actions to maximize the socio-economic benefits such as impacts on poverty, gender and fair \nemployment practices. It would also provide project start up support. \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will detail a project design that is economically, financially and technically \nfeasible. It will provide advance drafts of the complete set of documentation necessary for the \nADB to proceed with internal processing. It will prepare feasibility studies and comprehensive \ncriteria for road sections, logistics and institutional arrangements to be improved under the \nproject.
