The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) for preparing the Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing Railway Development Project for Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing. ADB considered this request, and the Fact-Finding Mission \n(i) visited the project area in July 2006; (ii) carried out an initial poverty and social assessment \nand a rapid environmental assessment; and (iii) discussed technical and socioeconomic issues \nwith representatives of the Government, provincial and local governments, and the Ministry of \nRailways (MOR). This paper is based on the understanding reached by the Government and the \nMission on the impact, outcome, output, activities, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB's  country \nassistance program for 2006.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.   Growth in the Railway Transportation Sector \n \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2005, \nthe  PRC  has  experienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth,  which  has  resulted  in  an \naccordingly  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation.  The  annual  growth  of  passenger \ntransport was 9% and freight transport grew at 7.6% during the 1978\u20132004 period. In 2005, \nroad traffic accounted for 53.2% of total passenger-kilometers (km), followed by railways with \n34.7%, civil aviation with 11.7%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. The modal split \nfor freight ton-km was 61.3% for coastal and inland waterways, 26.5% for railways, 11.0% for \nroads, 1.1% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation. \n \n3.  From 1978 and 2005, railway freight grew from 535 billion ton-km to 2.07 trillion ton-km, \nequivalent  to  an  annual  growth  rate  of  5.1%.  Meanwhile  passenger  traffic  grew  at  6.6% \nannually, increasing from 109 billion passenger-km to 606 billion passenger-km. The average \nlead for railway journeys increased from 134 km in 1978 to 527 km in 2005, which compares \nwith growth in the average journey per passenger on roads from 35 km to 54 km over the same \nperiod.  Despite  such  growth  rates,  railway  capacity  has  lagged  behind  demand  due  to \nconstraints  in  the  railway  system.  Given  rail\u2019s  important  role  in  providing  economical \ntransportation,  these  constraints,  if  not  removed,  will  continue  to  adversely  effect  efficient \neconomic growth. Because of these concerns, the Government has adopted an aggressive plan \nto improve the railways and has planned network extensions and construction in underserved \nareas. \n \nB.   Railway Strategy, Reforms, and Development Plan \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s policy on railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand  expanding  the  system,  (ii)  encouraging  construction  of  joint-venture  local  railways  to \npromote development of local economies, (iii) improving efficiency by using new technology and \nmodern management tools in planning and operation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies through \nappropriate pricing and commercialization of services, (v) initiating institutional and structural \nreforms to increase MOR\u2019s autonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment \ninvestment in infrastructure and related services.  \n \n5.  The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identified  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. It envisaged (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide access \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 June 2006.  \n ", " 2 \nto unserved areas, bringing the network length to a total of 75,000 route-km; (ii) providing 3,000 \nkm of double lines and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity, and (iii) increasing \noperating speeds on 5,000 km, bringing the total length of high speed lines to 15,000 km. Total \ninvestment of CNY350 billion was planned for the railway sector, including CNY270 billion on \ncapital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling stock. By the end of 2005, total investment of \nCNY308 billion for capital construction had been made for constructing 6,458 km of new lines, \nproviding 3,275 km of double lines, and electrifying 6,259 km of track. During 2003\u20132007, \ninvestments for capital construction are expected to reach CNY450 billion. The 11th Five-Year \nPlan (2006\u20132010) continues to emphasize railway development.  \n \n6.  In 2004, the state council approved the new railway development plan covering the \nperiod up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network from 72,000 km to 85,000 km \nby 2010 and to 100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is identified as a major goal. Train \nspeeds will be raised to more than 200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will \nbe given to developing railways in unserved areas and regions lacking transport that have \nremained less developed. The route network length will increase by 16,000 km in the PRC\u2019s \nwestern region to reach 40,000 km there by 2020. To improve operational efficiency, MOR has \ntaken steps to separate passenger and freight trains on key rail corridors. \n \nC.   ADB Strategy and External Assistance  \n \n7.  ADB's operational strategy for the railway sector in the PRC focuses on (i) expanding the \nrailway system in unserved, less developed, and poor areas; (ii) modernizing and increasing the \ncapacity  of  key  routes  of  the  national  railway  system  to  improve  transport  efficiency;  (iii) \ncommercializing  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations;  and  (iv)  increasing  rail\u2019s \ncompetitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and policy reform. The strategy will \ncontinue to focus on railway development in underserved areas in poor interior provinces in \norder to link lower-income regions with growth centers. That will facilitate pro-poor growth, a \nprerequisite for reducing poverty. The policy issues addressed in the railway sector include \ncorporatization, marketing and business development, and tariff setting with improved cost \nrecovery.  ADB  has  enhanced  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  and  is  providing  MOR  technical \nassistance support for policy reforms.2 This consultation will continue to further the reforms in \nthe sector.  \n \n8.  Japan is the major source of external financing in the PRC railway sector, followed by \nADB and the World Bank. Since 1979, Japan has provided about Y558 billion for 15 railway \nprojects to expand rail transportation capacity. ADB has focused on developing railways in \nless-developed inland provinces to promote growth and reduce poverty. ADB provided 13 loans, \ntotaling about $2.6 billion, to finance construction of about 1,921 km of provincial railways and \n4,597 km of national railway projects. The World Bank has provided 10 loans since 1984, \ntotaling  over  $2.4 billion,  for  nine  national  railway  projects  to  expand  railway  capacity  on \nhigh-priority  corridors,  modernize  system\u2013wide  technology,  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapabilities, as well as for one local railway project.  \n \nD.   Project \n  \n9.  The project involves constructing 817 km of class I double-track electrified railway line \nand 21 new railway stations in the hilly and mountainous area in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for World Trade Organization-Policy Reform \nSupport to the Ministry of Railways. Manila. \n ", "    3 \nprovinces, as well as Chongqing municipality. The railway will link the main city of Lanzhou in \nthe northwest to Chongqing in southwest PRC (see map). The project impact area includes 13 \ncounties and cities with a total population of about 15 million in Dingxi, Guangyuan, Hechuan, \nLanzhou, Longnan, and Nanchong cities. The total rural population is about 10.5 million, of \nwhich about 1.2 million people (11.6%) live below the poverty line, including those in 2,240 \npoverty villages that do not have access to highways, electricity, telephone service, or potable \nwater.  \n \n10.  Most  people  living  in  the  area  work  in  agriculture  characterized  by  a  low  level  of \nproductivity. Despite the area\u2019s rich natural resources and good tourist potential, the people \nhave  remained  largely  poor  and  cut  off  from  mainstream  development  due  to  a  lack  of \ntransportation. No expressway or railway connects this region. The existing class II road passes \nthrough difficult terrain, has limited passing capacity, and is in poor condition. The railway link \nwill provide the shortest north\u2013south rail route from Xinjiang, Baoji and Lanzhou to Chongqing \nand  Kunming.  The  line  will  also  connect  central  Asia  (Alashankou\u2013Xinjiang\u2013Lanzhou)  with \nsoutheast Asia (Chongqing\u2013Guiyang-Kunming\u2013Hekou). \n \n11.  The project will help develop the railroad network in an unserved area and enhance \npro-poor economic growth. It is included as a priority project in MOR\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan, as \nwell as the railway development plan, and the project will support the Government\u2019s western \nregion development strategy. The railway will facilitate economic development and integration of \nthe  poor  western  region  and  is  expected  to  stimulate  industrial  and  natural  resources \ndevelopment as well as tourism and related industries. The railway will, in the construction and \noperation phases, increase local people\u2019s access to markets and social services and give them \nopportunity to improve their living standards. Completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway \nprojects show that such projects create jobs in construction and in loading and unloading \noperations, as well as such other income-generating activities as the supply of materials, food \nand  small  services  around  construction  sites.3  The  lower  transportation  costs  after  project \ncompletion will make goods and services available at more economical prices to the people \nliving in the area, including the poor, and provide them with opportunities to sell their produce to \nbroader markets. Most people living in the project area have not traveled beyond the nearest \ntown due to high transport fares. The railway will offer them more affordable, reliable, and \npunctual transport than is currently available. The project will improve the living standards of \nlocal people and influence all aspects of their daily lives, directly or indirectly, in a positive \nmanner. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy and will support the \nGovernment\u2019s strategic policy objective of greater developmental emphasis on poor, interior, \nand underserved areas of the PRC by improving transportation linkage with growth centers. \n \n12.  The project envisages the construction of an electrified double-track railway line with \nsubgrades,  bridges,  and  tunnels.  Because  of  the  hilly  topography  along  the  Lanzhou\u2013\nChongqing railway route, tunnels and bridges will comprise 75% of the route\u2019s length. \n \n13.  The project will be undertaken as a joint venture between MOR and the Chongqing, \nGansu, and Sichuan provincial or municipal governments and will be implemented by MOR. A \nfeasibility  study  is  being  prepared  with  cost  estimates  that  reflect  current  materials  and \nconstruction  prices  and  traffic  forecasts.  MOR  advised  ADB  that  the  project  proposal  is \n                                                 \n3  In the ADB-financed Daxian\u2013Waxian Railway Project, the average net income along the proposed alignment of the \nrailway increased by 25% in real terms during the construction period. The average real increase in Chongqing for \nthe same period was approximately 10%. Education is often the first spending priority for families. Because of an \nimproved cash position, some poor people are reportedly no longer indebted for school tuition for the next \ngeneration. (ADB. 1996.

The feasibility study, environmental impact assessment (EIA), and draft resettlement plan \nwill  be  submitted  to  ADB  by  September  2006.  The  provincial  and  local  governments  of \nChongqing,  Gansu,  and  Sichuan  provinces  confirmed  that  all  the  affected  counties  have \nexperience  in  implementing  resettlement  projects.  Resettlement  under  the  project  will  be \nimplemented as per the national laws, provincial regulations and ADB policy on involuntary \nresettlement.4 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The TA aims to help develop an efficient, reliable, and affordable railway transport \nsystem in Chongqing municipality and in Gansu and Sichuan provinces. The TA will (i) help the \nGovernment  in  reviewing  and  strengthening  the  project  feasibility  study,  EIA,  plan  for \nresettlement, and related studies to meet ADB's requirements for possible financing; (ii) identify \npolicy  measures  and  institutional  development  needs  that  will  improve  railway  operational \nefficiency and management and ensure financial sustainability of operations; and (iii) identify the \nsocial dimensions to be incorporated into the project design, including measures to enhance \nsocial development and reduce poverty in the project area. The outcome will be the design of a \nproject suitable for ADB financing. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The work under the TA will: (i) review and strengthen the feasibility study to meet ADB \nrequirements for: (a) technical aspects related to construction and operation; (b) economic and \nfinancial analyses, including to review the traffic forecast and financial performance of project \nfacilities operations; and (c) financial management assessment, including to review budgetary \nand planning control, financial and management accounting, and internal control and audit \nsystems; (ii) develop a set of measurable performance indicators, including for socioeconomic \nand poverty dimensions, and a sustainable mechanism for monitoring during and beyond the \nconstruction  stage;  (iii)  recommend  policy  measures  that  will  improve  railway  operating \nefficiency and management and assess specific institutional development needs in order to \ncommercially operate the project facilities and ensure financial sustainability; (iv) review the \npotential  for  private  sector  participation  in  construction,  provision  of  services,  and  tourism \ndevelopment; (v) review and update the EIA report and prepare a summary EIA with appropriate \nenvironmental monitoring and management plans; (vi) review and refine the resettlement plan \nso that involuntary resettlement will be consistent with ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines; (vii) review \nthe initial poverty and social assessment; carry out a detailed poverty and social analysis, \nincluding a baseline socioeconomic profile of the population living in the project area; and \nprepare relevant mitigation and enhancement measures (Appendix 2); and (viii) undertake a \ndistribution analysis of the project and associated developments on poverty reduction.  \n \n16.  The  TA\u2019s  key  activities  are  field  surveys;  document  review;  data  analysis;  and \nconsultations with stakeholders that include government officials, project beneficiaries, and such \naffected people as minority groups, women, and the poor.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1995.

The cost of the TA is estimated at $670,000 equivalent, of which the Government \nrequested that ADB finance $500,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  MOR  will  provide  the  remaining  $170,000  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency cost for counterpart staff, office facilities, support services, and local communications. \nThe Government and MOR have been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will require about 39 person-months of consulting services (15 international and \nabout 24 national) spread over 5 months, including fieldwork. ADB will engage consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2005). A consulting firm will be \nselected and engaged following the quality and cost-based selection method, and simplified \ntechnical  proposals  will  be  required.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \ntransport economics, traffic forecasting, railway engineering and operation, institution building, \nresettlement, and social and poverty analysis. These consultants will also have expertise in \nfinancial analysis, financial management, and environmental sciences. Expertise required from \nnational consultants will be in transport economics, railway engineering and operation, and \nresettlement and socioeconomics. Environmental engineering expertise will also be needed. \nAppendix 4 provides outline terms of reference for the consulting services. The consultants will \nprocure equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006), and this will be \nhanded over to the Executing Agency upon completing the TA. \n \n19.  The TA is expected to begin in November 2006 and be completed by May 2007. MOR, \nas the Executing Agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring TA activities. The \nGovernment and MOR have agreed to provide the assistance required for implementing the TA. \nMOR will make available (i) all relevant reports, studies, and information; (ii) suitable office \naccommodation and appropriate and qualified counterpart staff; (iii) local transport facilities \nneeded to visit the site; and (iv) any other assistance that the consultants may reasonably \nrequest, including liaison with the Government and local authorities. \n \nIV.
