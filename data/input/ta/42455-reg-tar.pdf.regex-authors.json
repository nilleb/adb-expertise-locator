The  UN-HABITAT  2006  Annual  Report  projected  that  Asia\u2019s  urban  population  will \nincrease from the current 40% of the total to 55% by 2030 and will be the driving force of the \nglobal economy in the 21st century.1 More than half of the world\u2019s megacities will be in Asia, \nwith small and medium-sized cities growing at a faster rate than large ones. Population growth \nin  Asia\u2019s  urban  areas  during  this  period  will  be  unprecedented.  Achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goal  of  halving  the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe \ndrinking water or basic sanitation by 2015 is getting more challenging in Asia\u2019s urban areas. \nUrban water supply and sanitation (WSS) improvement has consistently been at the center of \nthe international development agenda. Typically, WSS capacity development programs are \nbased largely on training individual staff members as the target unit for a selected WSS subtopic. \nHowever, water system improvements can hardly be achieved unless various interlinked factors \nare coordinated. Individual staff members often have no way to influence the entire WSS \noperation upon their return to duty, despite their enhanced skills and knowledge from various \ntrainings. This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) attempts to improve the \neffectiveness and sustainability of capacity development programs by targeting water operators \nas a training unit.  \n \n2.  The concept of the TA was approved by the director general of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) South Asia Department on 26 September 2008. Financing of $500,000 will be from \nthe Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund.2 The TA Fact-Finding Mission \nwas carried out during 7\u201313 November 2008. Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water) \n3\nhas been consulted and has agreed to be the implementing agency of the TA.  The TA design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Although  many  urban  areas  in  Asia  are  implementing  reforms  in  their  water  and \nsanitation sectors, many problems persist. Service coverage in urban areas is still far from \nuniversal, the average nonrevenue water (NRW) level is 40% or higher for many utilities, source \ndevelopment  is  not  keeping  pace  with  population  growth  or  demand  projections,  financial \nperformance is weak, and customer relations are poor. Substantial portions of South Asia suffer \npoor water quality or groundwater depletion or salinization. Shortfalls of electricity production \nconstrain continuous water pumping and aggravate prevailing problems caused by intermittent \nwater supply. In addition, climate change has increased the frequency and severity of flooding \nand drought. Water-related disasters have added to urban water management the dimensions \nof climate change adaptation and protection.  \n \n4.  These issues are systemically interlinked. Without fixing pipe leaks, one can hardly \nincrease  water  pressure.  Communities  and  politicians  will  not  accept  higher  tariffs  on \ninadequate water services, causing NRW to run up high revenue losses. This puts the financial \nsustainability of utilities\u2019 operation and management at risk, leaving inadequate funds to replace \nthe leaking pipes at the top of this vicious cycle. However, capacity development and training \nprograms are usually formulated by subtopic or technical area, rather than programmed for a \nholistic management perspective.  \n \n                                                 \n1  UN-HABITAT. 2007. 2006 Annual Report. Nairobi. \n2  Approved by the Government of the Republic of Korea on 1 December 2008. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 October 2008. \n ", "2   \n5.  ADB\u2019s  water  supply  projects  have  repeatedly  incorporated  various  types  of  TA  to \nstrengthen water utilities\u2019 governance and develop technical capacity to, for example, improve \nthe  corporate  structures  of  the  utilities,  promote  tariff  reform  and  NRW  reduction,  enable \nregulatory bodies, strengthen technical staffers\u2019 daily operation and management skills, raise \npublic awareness, and improve customer services. Despite these efforts, achieving universal \nimprovement has not been possible with limited resources. Training components are inadequate, \nand investments in capacity development have often become sunk costs, whose benefits are \nrarely shared with or replicated in other localities, despite the gains potentially achievable by \nproviding the same training to those with similar problems. \n \n6.  Urban  WSS  improvement  has  consistently  been  at  the  center  of  the  international \ndevelopment agenda and will continue be there in the context of rapidly urbanizing Asia. Needs \nare particularly urgent in South Asia, where achievements toward the Millennium Development \nGoals on WSS have been lower than elsewhere in Asia. In this regard, capacity development \nprograms dealing with common problems in South Asian countries can be more efficiently \nprovided if structured systematically and replicated widely, rather than repeatedly reinventing \nthe wheel. In addition, ADB\u2019s recent initiatives, such as the (i) NRW training workshop in June \n2008,  (ii)  twinning  program  between  expert  and  recipient  water  utilities  through  technical \n4\nassistance,  and (iii) best practices on urban water management demonstration through a study \ntour  to  Manila  for  12  delegations  from  Nepal  and  Bangladesh  in  September  2008,  have \ndemonstrated that strong demand exists in South Asia for knowledge of good practices to \nimprove urban water management and governance. Successful development aids require not \nonly closing the resource gap but also bridging the knowledge gaps between the developed and \ndeveloping countries in Asia.  \n \n7.  In the context of a rapidly changing Asia, ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u2013\n2020  (Strategy  2020)  refocuses  ADB  operations  on  three  development  agendas:  inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.5 Key drivers of \nchange  in  operations  are  developing  the  private  sector,  encouraging  good  governance, \nsupporting gender equity, and helping developing member countries gain knowledge. Strategy \n2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s commitment to collaborate with other development institutions and the \nprivate sector for a more innovative and effective development role. It points out that ADB must \nsupport improved governance and arrange partnerships with a broad range of institutions to \ncontinue to be effective in meeting the emerging challenges of Asia and the Pacific. Further, \nAsian Water Development Outlook 2007 provides insights on managing water resources in Asia \nand suggests that there is enough knowledge, technology, and expertise in Asia to manage \nfuture water crises.6 In this connection, using knowledge to improve development effectiveness \nbecomes  an  increasingly  important  avenue  of  sustainable  development.  As  the  leading \nmultilateral development institution in Asia and the Pacific, ADB should play a catalytic role to \nfacilitate the sharing of knowledge, expertise, and lessons on good urban water governance and \nbest development practices across regions in Asia. Developing a replicable and sustainable \nprogram of capacity development partnerships for urban WSS management is the right course \nin line with Strategy 2020. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007.

The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, established in June \n2006, aims to facilitate the creation and sharing of experience, information, and knowledge in \nAsia and the Pacific. The rationale, outcomes, and outputs of the proposed TA are in line with \nthe  knowledge  partnership  program  under  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership Fund. \n \n9.  The potential for cooperation with K-water has been tested through a small twinning \nagreement in March 2008 (footnote 4). The twinning experience provides a good background for \nK-water\u2019s designing a training program that would be sustainable, as training is a core business \narea of K-water.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is improved capacity to manage and provide urban WSS services \nin South Asia. The expected outcome of the TA is to establish a sustainable capacity building \nand training program on WSS management and governance in partnership with K-water. \n \n11.  The TA aims to (i) build on K-water\u2019s existing WSS training programs, (ii) package a \nstructured series of training programs on WSS management and governance targeting WSS \noperators  and  organizations  as  training  units,  and  (iii)  establish  modular  training  courses \ninvolving water sector clients of ADB in South Asia. The innovative feature of the training \nprogram is its design identifying a WSS operator as the target training unit, rather than general \ncapacity development for technical subtopics or for individual participants from various WSS \noperators. As the TA aims to establish a structured and sustainable WSS training program, only \ntwo WSS operators will be trained as demonstration cases, as financing under the Republic of \nKorea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund is limited.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  framework  for  the  training  program  will  be  drafted  according  to  the  primary \nobjectives and intended outcomes of the TA. A detailed training program will be tailored for the \ntwo selected WSS operators and then executed. The framework of the training is a twinning \narrangement between the K-water Academy and each recipient, with K-water as the expert that \ncoaches the weaker WSS operator or organization on a continuing basis. Once a willing and \ncommitted  water  operator  is  screened  and  identified,  the  training  team  will  be  fielded  to \ndiagnose  current  operational  conditions  and  assess  the  training  needs  in  line  with  the \nframework.  The  contents  of  the  training  program  may  be  adjusted,  with  modules  flexibly \ncombined to address field conditions. The TA will be implemented over 1.5 years in three \ncomponents: \n \n13.  Component 1. The TA will explore K-water\u2019s existing training programs to assess their \nsuitability to train WSS operators and organizations as target units. Two South Asian cities will \nbe selected in connection with ADB\u2019s water projects. A team from K-water will conduct a full \ndiagnosis of the water operator in each pilot city, covering organizational, financial, technical, \nmanagement,  and  governance  aspects.  The  analysis  results  will  be  used  to  prepare  a \nstructured training program suitable for improving the performance of the WSS utility operator. \nK-water\u2019s existing training programs will be the bases for further tailoring and supplementing the \nneeds of the WSS utility operator concerned. The training program will be designed to target \nWSS utility service organizations as a single recipient, rather than individual participants from \n ", "4   \ndifferent operators and organizations.  \n \n14.  Component 2. The training framework, program, and modules will be implemented over \n1 year for both operators. Training will begin with the senior management team in the WSS \nutility operator and address business planning, with training modules covering (i) organizational \nmanagement aspects, (ii) institutional and legal reform requirements, (iii) financial management \nissues, (iv) technical skills improvement, (v) private sector participation in WSS business and \nservices, and (vi) innovation and adaptation for climate change, if needed. Participants from the \nWSS operators will include staff from the top management team to the mid-level technical \nmanagers for day-to-day operations. If feasible, senor policy makers who may influence the \ncountries\u2019 institutional legal framework for WSS\u2014such as politicians; ministries of planning, \npublic works, or finance; or budgeting offices\u2014will be invited to top-level policy dialogues for \nformulating the necessary reform agenda. Training modules will include lectures, field visits, \ndata preparation from the participating WSS operators, and hands-on practice and workshops. \nBased on what they have learned, training participants will prepare time-bound action plans by \ntopic  and  include  them  in  their  business  plans,  which  will  be  formulated  with  the  top \nmanagement team and assisted by K-water.  \n \n15.  Component  3. This will be largely devoted to follow-up actions to monitor whether \nparticipating water operators have achieved the target improvements in the 1-year period and to \nrefine the training program based on feedback from them. The entire cycle of the training \nmodule will be reviewed, modified, and adjusted accordingly. The last stage is expected to (i) \nfinalize the training program, (ii) recommend actions to replicate it, (iii) disseminate it widely, and \n(iv) establish the sustainability of the training program in consultation with relevant parties.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The cost of the TA is $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed as a grant from the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The \ngrant will cover the costs of program development, training, and travel by trainees and trainers. \nK-water will finance the balance of $100,000 with such in-kind contributions as the training \nvenue,  equipment,  and  accommodation.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  2  and  \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. ADB\u2019s South Asia Urban Development \nDivision will be responsible for administering the assistance. K-water is selected to be the \nImplementing Agency for the TA in consideration of its unique expertise and capacity to manage \na training program of this magnitude. The rationale for single-source selection and the profile of \nK-water is included in Supplementary Appendix B. No other consultants will be recruited for the \nTA. The TA is expected to begin in February 2009 and will be completed by September 2010. \nMunicipal water operators or utilities should transmit a commitment letter to ADB for undergoing \nthe training under this TA. Cities and towns with ongoing or upcoming ADB WSS projects will \nhave priority. A no objection certificate will be obtained in writing from the government of \nparticipating countries before commencing or financing the proposed activities. The outline \nterms  of  reference  (Appendix  3)  and  the  draft  framework  of  the  training  program \n(Supplementary  Appendix  C)  were  prepared  in  coordination  with  the  K-water.  A  draft \npartnership agreement (Supplementary Appendix D) has been prepared for signing by the \nappropriate authorities of each party upon ADB\u2019s approval of the proposed TA. Under the \n ", "  5\npartnership arrangement, disbursement will be as a lump sum paid according to the schedule in \nthe partnership agreement. \n \n18.  Appropriate information on TA activities, including the design of the training framework, \nprogress in executing the training program, and effectiveness of this training approach, will be \ndisseminated widely on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, for Partnership \nfor Good Governance and Knowledge on Urban Water Management, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  Improved access to safe  Millennium Development  South Asian governments \ncapacity to  drinking water by 7% and to  Goal report and the  are committed to the \nmanage and  sanitation by 9% by 2015 in  progress report by the  sustainable improvement of \nprovide urban  South Asiaa  United Nations Children\u2019s  basic urban services. \nwater and  Fund  Risk \nsanitation    Lack of interest by the \nservices in South  Government of the Republic \nAsia   of Korea or recipient \ngovernments in establishing \nsustainable partnerships and \nfinancial agreements beyond \nthe TA \nOutcome      Assumption \nSustainable and  Partnership agreement with  Annual report of K-water  Developing member country \neffective capacity  K-water   governments will nominate, \nADB project performance \ndevelopment and  in a timely manner, officials \nSustainability of the training  information system \ntraining program  in relevant positions to \nprogram secured by an \nestablished on  attend the training sessions. \noptimal financing scheme \nurban water and  Risk \nagreed by partners and \nsanitation  Lack of political will to \nstakeholders  \nmanagement and  improve water sector \ngovernance  governance \nOutputs  Diagnosis report  TA reports  Assumption \n1.

The main objective of the technical assistance (TA) Partnership for Good Governance and \nKnowledge on Urban Water Management is to establish a sustainable and effective capacity \ndevelopment and training program dealing with the common problems of urban water supply and \nsanitation  (WSS)  management  and  governance  in  South  Asia.  In  light  of  this,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assumes a proactive role as a catalyst in sharing expert knowledge in \nAsia and the Pacific that is relevant for its developing member countries. To capture and translate \nurban WSS management experience into locally useful knowledge, ADB has initiated a partnership \nwith Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water) to carry out the assignment described in paras. \n3\u20135. \n \n2.  ADB will communicate with relevant government offices in South Asia to identify the most \nsuitable two cases for the assignment. Broadly, the selection criteria for the two cases will be the \nwillingness and commitment of their leadership to undergo training similar to twinning and the \npresence in their service areas of WSS problems prevailing in South Asian developing countries, \nwith priority given to urban areas with ongoing or planned ADB water projects. \n \n3.  Objective and Scope. The objectives of the assignment are to (i) develop an effective \ncapacity development framework on urban WSS management and governance and (ii) establish a \nreplicable training program for South Asian developing countries. The scope of work will be two \nselected pilot cities, one with a population of about 0.5 million and another with no more than 5 \nmillion. The draft framework (Supplementary Appendix C) will be further refined. In line with the \nframework, K-water will refine and conduct a training program fit for the selected case cities. The \nprocess will begin by fielding a diagnostic team. A follow-up monitoring stage should be included in \nthe last phase of the training to assess the performance of the pilot cases. K-water may involve \nexternal experts as required in the field of WSS management and governance. \n \n4.  Implementation Period and Indicative Schedule of the Activities. The assignment will \nbe implemented over 18 months. It is desirable to formulate a training program for each case \nsequentially, so that learning and experience from the first case can be reflected in the second \ncase. It is expected that some of the activities for the first case may cascade into the second case. \nThe indicative timeline of activities is in the Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n5.  Activities. The detailed terms of reference and activities of the assignment will include, but \nnot necessarily be limited to, the following: \n(i)  Developing the WSS capacity development framework. K-water will build the \nframework  based  on  its  existing  expertise  and  experience  to  be  suitable  for \ndeveloping countries in South Asia. \n(ii)  Fielding diagnostic teams to assess and record the baseline data. K-water will \nfield a team to each case area for initial diagnosis of WSS conditions and use this \nassessment to benchmark and refine the training program in line with the capacity \ndevelopment framework. \n(iii)  Developing  and  conducting  a  tailor-made  training  program  for  each  case. \nBased on the diagnosis of the case recipient, K-water will refine the optimal training \nprogram. The training will be conducted through workshops, lectures, hands-on \ntraining, field visits, discussions, and some report writing by the participants to \nprepare their action plans.  \n(iv)  Helping recipient WSS operators to prepare draft business plans with time-\nbound actions. At the end of the training, the recipient WSS operator should have \nits  own  business  plan  with  specific  actions  for  improving  WSS  operations  and \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \nmanagement. Developing it will be part of the training program. Participants will be \nencouraged to suggest their action agenda based on what they have learned, and \ntheir short-term action items should be included in the business plan. The short-term \naction items will be part of performance monitoring toward the end of the training \nperiod. The business plan will be discussed, and senior management participants \nwill be encouraged to carry it out. Any further assistance required for the plan to \nmaterialize should be identified for ADB\u2019s consideration.  \n \n(v)  Monitoring and following-up performance improvement. K-water will conduct a \nmonitoring  and  follow-up  visit  to  the  recipient  WSS  operator  and  evaluate  its \nperformance regarding management and governance in light of its immediate action \nplans as recorded in the draft business plan. Any necessary remedial measures, if \ndeficiencies are found, will be identified and recommended. This monitoring visit will \nbe scheduled for 4 months after training completion. \n \n(vi)  Finalizing the capacity development framework and a model training program. \nAfter conducting the two trainings, K-water will compile the following for the final \nreport: training procedures, program arrangement and logistics, learning experience \non refinement, issues critical for further improving the effectiveness of future training, \nsuggestions  for  training  programs,  and  recommendations  for  enhancing \nsustainability. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090123075542+08'00'", "Subject": "Regional Capacity Development Technical Assistance (R-CDTA)", "Author": "TRR", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "urban water management, korea e-Asia and knowledge partnership, regional capacity development technical assistance, adb R-CDTA, south asia WSS services, WSS training program, adb technical assistance 6523, adb project 42455", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090126135513+08'00'", "Title": "Partnership for Good Governance and Knowledge on Urban Water Management  (Financed by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund)"}, "author_page": " \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  K-water  \u2013  Korea Water Resources Corporation \n  NRW  \u2013  nonrevenue water \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  WSS  \u2013  water supply and sanitation \n \n \n \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nType  \u2013  Regional capacity development technical assistance (R-CDTA) \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Water supply, sanitation, and waste management \nSubsector  \u2013  Water supply and sanitation \nThemes  \u2013  Sustainable economic growth \nSubthemes  \u2013  Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \nVice-President  X.
