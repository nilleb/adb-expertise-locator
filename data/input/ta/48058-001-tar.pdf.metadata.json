INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2013  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for a country water assessment (CWA). During a fact-finding \nmission on 6 March 2014, ADB and the government agreed on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, \noutputs,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of \nreference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Although approximately 20% of the world's population lives in the PRC, the country is \nendowed with only 7% of global freshwater resources. Development and growth, while critical \nfor moving the country\u2019s economy forward, are putting further stress on its limited freshwater \nresources.  Demand  for  water,  food,  and  energy  is  increasing  rapidly  as  urbanization, \nindustrialization, and population rise. When combined with climate change and natural disasters, \nthe sustainable future of the country\u2019s water becomes even more uncertain. \n \n3.  Feeding a population of 1.4 billion by 2030 will require producing more food with less \nwater  through  improved  water  productivity  and  efficiency  in  agriculture.  Higher  rates  of \nurbanization and increasing demand for drinking water and domestic use will increase stress on \nexisting water sources. Energy demands could more than double in the next 20 years and will \ncome with simultaneous increases in water demand. Hydropower will be a key contributor for \nclean energy production and \u201cgreen development.\u201d Aside from these human activities, ensuring \nthat  environmental  water  flow  required  to  sustain  ecosystems  and  biodiversity  are  also \nmaintained is critical. \n \n4.  Climate change scenarios for the PRC show an increased likelihood of more severe \nstorms, flooding, and droughts in many provinces. For example, the drought in 2011 illustrated \nthat even the Yangtze Basin, one of the largest basins in the world and recognized for high \nannual  rainfall,  is  susceptible  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  unsustainable  water \nconsumption. The drought reinforced the need to implement appropriate adaptation measures \nand natural disaster risk management. \n \n5.  Undermining the country\u2019s resilience to droughts is a growing scarcity of water. The PRC \nhas a far smaller amount of available (usable) water than its total renewable water resources, a \nresult  of  not  only  the  natural  characteristics  of  the  country\u2019s  diverse  landscape  and \nmicroclimates, but also of the fragmented and uncoordinated management of its economic \ndevelopment and natural resources. When the effects of pollution are factored in, only about \n30% of the country\u2019s total renewable water resources are usable.2 \n \n6.  The PRC recently experienced several river pollution incidents, including (i) the high-\nprofile Songhua River toxic chemical spill in November 2005; (ii) drinking water source pollution \nin Tai Lake, Wuxi in May 2007 due to algae; and (iii) water pollution accidents in Lanzhou and \nWuhan during 2014. If not immediately and effectively controlled, these incidents can cause \npollution  releases  to  spread  across  boundaries  of  administrative  jurisdictions,  causing \nenvironmental and economic damages, as well as public concern and potential social unease. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 May 2014. \n2  ADB. 2012. Drying-Up: What to Do About the Droughts in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n7.  The mounting challenges posed by changing and often conflicting demands for natural \nresources in the PRC highlight the importance of water in any development and growth agenda. \nThe country\u2019s ability to make adequate water available for domestic, agricultural, industrial, and \nenvironmental uses will depend on better management of water resources and increased cross-\nsector planning and integration. \n \n8.  In January 2011, for the first time in the 62-year history of the modern PRC, the No. 1 \nCentral  Document  explicitly  targeted  and  called  for  water  conservancy  and  watershed \nmanagement in response to record-breaking water-related natural disasters.3 The document \nprioritizes the government\u2019s work on water resources, with spending estimated at CNY4 trillion \nthrough 2020, and urges local governments to set aside 10% of their revenue from land sales \nfor use in agricultural water conservancy and irrigation works. It also calls for comprehensive \nflood protection and drought management plans to be in place by 2020. \n \n9.  The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party \nCongress reiterated its commitment to economic restructuring, inclusive growth, and sustainable \nnatural  resources  management.  The  reform  agenda  includes  programs  in  major  areas  of \neconomic and social development and ecological civilization that will create new opportunities \nfor improving human health and natural resources management (including water resources) in \nan  integrated  manner, striving for green  development. In  addition,  the government  is  now \ndeveloping the 13th Five-Year Plan on Social and Economic Development, 2016\u20132020.4 The \n13th plan is expected to place significant emphasis on the PRC's water resources management \npolicy, and preventive and corrective actions in the coming years. \n \n10.  Following the decision of the Third Plenary Session, on 16 March 2014 the State Council \nissued the new National Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020, which highlights the environmental \ncarrying capacity of river basins and urges the urban master planning to draw \u201cred lines\u201d5 to \nprotect surface and underground waters during future urbanization. \n \n11.  Given rapidly changing growth dynamics and the pressing need to integrate sustainable \ndevelopment planning, ADB and the government have agreed to conduct a CWA. The TA for \nthe CWA will be used to improve policies and strategies in the water sector, particularly to \nimprove  national  water  security  and  to  deal  with  water  scarcity.  The  CWA  will  support \npreparation of the 13th plan on water resources management, and will ensure that ADB\u2019s \nstrategy and programs respond to water security challenges and are consistent with the PRC\u2019s \nwater policy directions. \n \n12.  Conducting a CWA for the PRC is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan and \nknowledge management plan.6 It is also in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS), \n2011\u20132015 for the PRC, which supports the government\u2019s goal of building a harmonious society \nby promoting environmentally sustainable development.7 \n \n                                                \n3   China Daily.

The impact will be increased water security through improved water governance in the \nPRC. The outcome will be strengthened water management by the government and enhanced \nADB water operations in the PRC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The  TA  will  produce  three  outputs:  CWA  completed,  potential  assistance  to  the \ngovernment  for  the  13th  plan  delineated  (as  inputs  to  the  upcoming  ADB  CPS),  and  a \nstakeholder engagement mechanism established. \n \n15.  Output 1: Country water assessment completed.8 The TA will produce a CWA report, \nwhich will include (i) a water resources profile, (ii) international best practices and implications \nfor water management in the PRC, (iii) assessment of water security risks and identification of \noptions, and (iv) a water management strategy for a green economy to 2030.  \n \n16.  Output 2: Potential assistance to the government for the 13th plan delineated (as \ninputs to the upcoming ADB CPS). Activities will include (i) identification of key issues and \noptions in water resources management as an input to the PRC\u2019s 13th plan; (ii) presentation of \nrecommendations to the Ministry of Finance and ADB management, and incorporation in the \nCWA  and  CPS;  (iii)  identification  of  specific  recommendations  and  formulation  of  concept \npapers for water resources lending and nonlending projects; and (iv) identification of specific \nrecommendations for water resources programs of the PRC and ADB to enhance strategic \nrelations for capacity building. \n \n17.  Output 3: Stakeholder engagement mechanism established. Activities will include  \n(i) establishment of a cross-agency expert panel, (ii) conduct of four stakeholder consultations, \nand (iii) conduct of three consultation workshops to reach consensus on the CWA. \n \n18.  The CWA will be complemented by a set of water security case studies based on the \nAsian Water Development Outlook approach led by ADB.9 These case studies will include  \n(i)  household  water  security:  nonrevenue  water  reduction,  and  rural\u2013urban  integration  and \nreform for access to water supply; (ii) economic water security: water\u2013food nexus, water\u2013energy \nnexus, and inland water transport; (iii) urban water security: storm-water management, urban \nflood management, and urban wastewater and water supply; (iv) environmental water security: \nsustainable  groundwater  management,  eco-compensation  schemes  in  interprovincial  river \nbasins, cleaning up water in the PRC (lessons from reviving Chao Lake), and agricultural \nnonpoint source pollution management; (v) resilience to water-related disasters: water-related \ndisaster  risk  management;  and  (vi)  cross-cutting  issues:  water  allocation  schemes  in  river \nbasins, and a water secure future in the Poyang lake watershed. \n \n19.  The TA assumes that (i) government is committed to implementing the 13th plan on \nwater resources, (ii) the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) and ministries concerned have \nstrong  commitment  and  ownership  and  will  participate  in  CWA  preparation,  and  (iii)  the \n                                                \n8  High quality knowledge product and policy brief geared for high-level decision-makers and international audiences \nwill be produced using staff time. \n9  ADB. 2013. Asian Water Development Outlook 2013. Manila. \n \n ", "4   \nrecommended measures will be adopted. Some risks are associated with TA implementation:          \n(i) the government has inadequate investment and capacity in water resources management, (ii) \ndeliverables are not delivered on time, and (iii) agencies not involved in natural resources are \nnot provided with incentives to participate actively. \n \n20.  The strong leadership, vision, and ownership demonstrated by the Ministry of Finance \nand MWR during ADB\u2019s involvement in the PRC will mitigate the risks and ensure efficient and \neffective  TA  implementation.  Extensive  consultations  and  planning  meetings  with  involved \nnational, provincial, and local stakeholders will be held to ensure that all sectors are fully aware \nof the new development approaches and opportunities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which $200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $300,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund10 under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support \nin  the  form  of  office  space,  administrative  staff,  workshop  facilities,  data  collection, \nestablishment of the cross-agency expert panel, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  provide  policy  and  institutional  support  for  TA \nimplementation. MWR, as the executing agency, will establish a steering committee chaired by \nits vice minister, and with members from the planning department, international department, and \nwater strategic research center. TA implementation will be  coordinated with other key line \nagencies,  including  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental Protection, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development. A cross-\nagency expert panel will be established to ensure good coordination and quality control of CWA \npreparation.  A  project  management  office  will  be  established  in  MWR.  Three  consultation \nworkshops  will  be  held  with  government  agencies  and  relevant  stakeholders.  MWR  has \nimplemented  ADB-financed  TA  projects  since  the  1990s  and  has  experience  with  TA \nadministration. \n \n23.  ADB will supervise the TA activities. Given the nature and importance of this policy and \nadvisory TA, a national entity or firm will be hired to manage the national consultants and ADB \nwill engage the international consultants on an individual basis in compliance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Among the required expertise \nare water resources management, water resources planning, water resources policy, water \nresources  economics,  urban  development,  watershed  ecosystem  management,  agricultural \nirrigation, urban water supply and demand management, water pollution control, ecosystem \nmanagement, water\u2013energy nexus, climate change adaptation, and groundwater management. \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n24.  The TA will be implemented from 1 October 2014 to 31 March 2016. The ADB team will \ncollaborate with MWR during TA implementation to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of \nresults and maintain progress on plans for the CWA exercise. TA progress will be measured \n                                                \n10 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n ", "  5 \nagainst the design and monitoring framework, the consultants\u2019 terms of reference, and TA \nprogress reports. TA results will be disseminated through the release of the project reports, the \nTA workshops, and media releases. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant \nbasis, to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Country Water Assessment, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased water  Goal and targets specified in  MWR\u2019s annual statistics  The government is \nsecurity through  the 13th Five-Year Plan on  report  committed to implement \nimproved water  water resources are  the 13th plan on water \ngovernance in the  achieved and tasks specified  resources. \nPRC  in the 13th plan are fulfilled   \nby 2020 \nRisk \nThe government\u2019s \ninvestment and \ncapacity in water \nresources management \nare not adequate. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened  Emerging issues and  ADB\u2019s CPS for the PRC  MWR and ministries \nwater management  instruments addressing water    concerned have strong \nby the government  security are identified and    commitment and \nand enhanced ADB  adopted by the PRC CPS by    ownership and will \nwater operations in  September 2015    participate in preparing \nthe PRC      the CWA. \n     \nRecommendations for the  MWR\u2019s annual work  The recommended \nwater management strategy  report   measures will be \nfor green economy toward \nadopted. \n2030 are considered by the \n \ngovernment by December \n2015  Risks \nDeliverables are not \ncompleted on time. \nSome agencies outside \nof the natural resources \nsector may not \nparticipate actively. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
