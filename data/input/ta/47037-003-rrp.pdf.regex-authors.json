Investment Program Summary\nIn recent years, Sri Lanka has improved its energy sector and achieved a national electrification ratio of 94% (2012) as \ncompared with 29% in 1990.  However, a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel \nenergy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and\n(b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal oil-fired energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in \nSource:AsianDevelopmentBank 21042014143413772275\nThisdocumentmustonlybegeneratedineOps.

Demand growth has been mostly met by expensive oil-fired thermal \nplants. This is not a viable and sustainable solution to the country's energy security and environment protection in the long term.\nDiversification of the generation mix primarily to renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical \nlosses and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network needs \nexpansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces.  The 33 \nkilovolt medium voltage network needs to expand power supply into rural areas where many households have poor reliability \nand inadequate quality of electricity supply. For sustainable functioning of the power sector, the government pursues financial, \nmanagerial, and institutional reforms in line with the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009.\nImpact and Outcome: The impact (of the facility) is increased access to clean and reliable power supply.\n The outcome (of the facility) is enhanced clean power generation, system efficiency and reliability.\nOutputs: (i)Hydropower generation developed and connected to the grid in the Central Province, (ii)Transmission infrastructure \nenhanced, (iii)Efficiency of medium voltage network improved, (iv)Demand-side management for energy efficiency improved,  \nand (v)Capacity development support provided to Ceylon Electricity Board.\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) will be the executing agency/ies. \n \nProject Readiness: Environmental and other government clearances have been obtained. Project Implementaton Units for \nProject 1 components were appointed. The detailed engineering design of the hydropower plant was completed under ADB's \nprevious Sustainable Power Sector Support Project. Procurement activities have been initiated under advance contracting \napproved at the Management Review Meeting on 7 April 2014.  Draft prequalification and bidding documents for construction of \nthe hydropower plant have been prepared.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a multitranche \nfinancing facility (MFF) to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Green Power \nDevelopment and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The investment program includes (i) construction of a 30-megawatt (MW), run-of-river \nhydropower plant; (ii) transmission infrastructure enhancement for absorption of intermittent \nrenewable energy; (iii) network efficiency improvements; (iv) demand-side management (DSM) \ninterventions; and (v) project management and institutional capacity development in Central, \nEastern, Northern, North Central, North Western, and Western provinces.2  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM  \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  the  energy  sector  are  reflected  in  the \nimproved national electrification ratio: from 29% in 1990 to  94% by 2012.3 However, high \ndependence  on  expensive  fossil fuel  energy  continues.  Sector  challenges  include  meeting \ngrowing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability, and attaining long-term \nsustainability. The increase of the share of thermal oil-fired energy in power generation, from \n6% in 1995 to 59% in 2012, creates a high cost base. The use of expensive oil-fired thermal \nplants to meet the growing demand is not a viable and sustainable solution for energy security \nand environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix primarily to \nrenewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical losses, and supply- \nand demand-side management are needed. The transmission network needs to be expanded \nand  modernized,  particularly  in  former  conflict-affected  areas  in  Northern  and  Eastern \nprovinces.4 Expansion of the 33-kilovolt (kV) medium-voltage network is required to provide \npower to rural areas where many households have poor reliability and inadequate supply.  \n \n4.  Policy framework and road map. Sri Lanka\u2019s national investment program is based on \nthe 2006 10-year development framework5 (updated in 2010).6 The framework includes a long-\nterm energy sector investment program, sector road map, and policy and reform measures \nlinked to the National Energy Policy and Strategies.7 By 2020, the objectives are to (i) increase \npower supply capacity to about 6,400 MW, and reduce generation cost by adding aggregate \nbaseload capacity of about 2,000 MW from three coal-fired plants; (ii) increase the share of grid \nenergy supply from nonconventional renewable energy sources to 20%;8 and (iii) reduce total \nnetwork losses to 10%. To reduce the current high cost of thermal power generation and attain \ncost recovery by 2017, the government plans to develop 2,000 MW of coal-fired capacity. It is \ncomplimentary to the development of renewable energy to achieve the energy security. As part \nof  its  cost  recovery  strategy,  the  government  increased  retail  electricity  tariffs  by  35%  on \naverage in April 2013. While the government aims to increase supply capacity and replace \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2013.

Colombo. \n8  Nonconventional renewable energy sources include mini hydropower (less than 10 MW capacity), wind, solar, and \nbiomass. ", "2 \nexpensive and inefficient oil-fired power plants by constructing coal-fired plants, the remaining \nsupply capacity will come from renewable sources (and future conversion of the oil-fired plants \nto gas-fired plants). The 20% increase in power generation from nonconventional renewable \nsources will be in addition to 28% (2012) of conventional hydropower and will ensure that in the \nfuture a substantial portion of electricity is generated by domestic clean energy sources. This \nwill address the critical issue of energy security. \n \n5.  Multitranche financing facility. The MFF will finance part of the government\u2019s energy \nsector investment program estimated at $4.8 billion for 2014\u20132020. It will focus on the green \npower development portion and help to encourage and facilitate private sector investment in \nrenewable power generation by improving transmission infrastructure. The MFF will support the \ndevelopment of hydropower generation and the proposed 200 MW wind power park in the \nNorthern Province by financing relevant power evacuation transmission infrastructure.9 It will \nalso help to continue an ongoing and essential dialogue with the government on pursuing power \nreforms in coordination with other interested parties and development partners. The MFF is \nconsistent with the country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Sri \nLanka.10 It builds on previous ADB interventions focused on renewable energy development \nincluding from hydropower, wind, and solar resources.11 \n \n6.  The government requested ADB support for developing renewable energy, particularly \nhydropower and wind power generation, energy and network efficiency subprojects through the \nMFF to expand transmission and medium-voltage infrastructure to improve efficiency, enable \npower evacuation from and manage integration of renewable energy in the power system. The \nrequired preconditions for the use of the MFF\u2014a road map and strategy, a policy framework, \ninvestment and financing plans, and reliable safeguard arrangements\u2014are in place. The MFF is \nthe most appropriate financing modality12 for a long-term partnership in these activities, given \nthe phased nature of investments in electricity generation and the need for flexibility in project \ndesign and implementation. It also ensures continuity in combining investments in physical and \nnonphysical aspects of renewable energy and energy efficiency development.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the investment program will be increased access to clean and reliable \npower supply. The outcome will be enhanced clean power generation, system efficiency, and \nreliability. \nC.  Outputs \n8.  The outputs will include the following:  \n                                                \n9  The first two wind parks of 100 MW each are expected to be established in 2017 and 2020 in the Mannar area of \nNorthern Province, followed by additional wind power developments. \n10  ADB. 2011.

In Central Province, a 30-MW, run-of-river \nhydropower  plant  will  be  built  at  Moragolla,13 including  0.5  km  of  132  kV \nassociated transmission infrastructure to connect the plant to the grid, which will \nincrease clean, low cost, baseload power generation. \n(ii)  Transmission infrastructure enhanced. In Eastern, Northern, North Central, \nNorth  Western,  and  Western  provinces,  220/132  kV,  220/132/33  kV,  and \n132/33 kV grid substations and associated lines will be constructed to absorb the \nincreased power demand and ensure stable system operation with intermittent \nwind and solar generation. \n(iii)  Efficiency  of  medium-voltage  network  improved.  In  Eastern  and  North \nWestern  provinces,  33-kV  lines  and  reactive  power  management  will  be \ndeveloped by installing switched capacitor banks in the medium-voltage network \nto address overloading of conductors, voltage drop in medium-voltage lines, and \npoor power factor.  \n(iv)  Demand-side  management  for  energy  efficiency  improved.  Pilot  DSM \nsubprojects  in  Colombo  will  (a)  use  smart  grid  and  metering  technologies,  \n(b) retrofit buildings with smart energy-saving technology, and (c) install cold \nthermal storage in selected buildings to achieve energy savings. \n(v)  Capacity development support provided to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). \nCapacity development will reinforce the physical investments and include (a) \ninstitutional capacity building for power system development, system operation \nand  dispatching,  and  energy  efficiency  improvement;  and  (b)  project \nmanagement,  including  implementation  supervision  and  preparation  of  new \nprojects for the second tranche.  \n \n9.  In 2014, project 1 will include the construction of (i) the 30-MW, run-of-river hydropower \nplant at Moragolla and associated transmission infrastructure; (ii) four new grid substations and \nassociated  lines  at  Kerewalapitiya  (220/33  kV),  Kappalturai  (220/132/33  kV),  Kalutara  and \nKesbewa (both 132/33 kV), and augmentation of Katunayake and old Anuradhapura 132/33 kV \ngrid substations in Western, Eastern, and North Central provinces; (iii) 33 kV lines and gantries \naround Vavunativu and Madampe in Eastern and North Western provinces; and (iv) DSM pilot \nsubprojects in Colombo. Nonphysical outputs include capacity building and project management \nfor preparing future MFF investments and supervising implementation of capital investments of \nproject 1.14 In 2016, project 2 will include enhancement of transmission infrastructure, including \npower evacuation from the wind park; medium-voltage network efficiency improvement; and \nDSM subprojects. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n10.  The investment program is estimated to cost $440 million (Table 1).  \n \n11.  The government requested an MFF in an amount up to $360 million to finance the \ninvestment program. The financing includes a $216 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR), an $84 million loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF), 15 and a \n                                                \n13 The detailed engineering design was completed under ADB. 2011.

For the first MFF tranche of $180 million, the government has requested a loan of \n$121 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR 18.768 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources;18 and a loan of $30 million from AFD \n                                                \n16 The government will provide proceeds of the ADB loans to CEB on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n17 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 The requested loan is equivalent to $29 million (as of 19 May 2014, the date of the loan negotiations). \n ", "5 \nto be administered by ADB.  19 The OCR loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, a straight-line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft OCR loan and \nproject agreements.20 The Special Funds resources loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft ADF loan and project \nagreements.  \n \n13.  Since  the  MFF  involves  both  ADB-administered  cofinancing  resources  and  ADF \nresources,  universal  procurement  will  apply. 21  The  AFD  loan  will  finance  a  separate \nprocurement package for grid substations. The OCR loan will finance the construction of the \nMoragolla  hydropower  plant  and  a  portion  of  transmission  infrastructure,  while  the  ADF \nresources  loan  will  finance  medium-voltage  network  efficiency  improvement,  DSM  pilots, \nconsulting services, and a portion of transmission infrastructure. Accordingly, since the OCR will \nbe  blended  with  ADF  resources  at  the  project  level,  a  waiver  of  the  member  country \nprocurement eligibility restrictions applicable to ordinary capital resources is sought from the \nADB  Board  of  Directors.  The  government  and  CEB  will  finance  the  interest  during \nimplementation, taxes and duties, contingencies, and incremental costs (e.g., land acquisition, \nand environmental and social mitigation). Financing charges during implementation of about \n$13.67 million include interest during construction to be paid by the government to ADB and \nAFD for the provided loans. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) will be the executing agency; CEB will be the \nimplementing agency. A steering committee, chaired by the MOPE secretary, will guide CEB \nand review progress and results. CEB will set up project implementation units. The units will \noversee procurement, disbursement, financial management and accounting, quality assurance, \nsocial,  and  environmental  issues;  and  will  coordinate  with  the  procurement  committee, \nappointed by the cabinet or MOPE, depending on the contract size. Full-time managers will \nsupervise each project component under the MFF. \n \n15.  The government has asked ADB to approve advance contracting for procurement of \ngoods and civil works, including preparing bidding documents, and inviting and receiving bids \nfor project contracts, and retroactive financing under the MFF. Retroactive financing will be \nallowed for up to 20% of the individual loan amount for expenditures incurred 12 months prior to \nloan signing. The government was advised that ADB's approval of advance contracting and \nretroactive financing in principle does not commit ADB to finance any part of the MFF.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n16.  CEB prepared technical studies on power system stability, renewable energy master \nplans, and transmission enhancement requirements with ADB technical assistance (footnote \n11). The detailed engineering design of the hydropower plant was prepared under the ADB\u2019s \nprevious  loan  (footnote  13).  The  due  diligence  focused  on  technology,  nature  and \ncharacteristics  of  investment  plans,  seasonality  of  hydropower  capacity,  and  the  most \nappropriate electricity evacuation arrangements and renewable energy integration proposals. \nADB assessed the technical studies as acceptable. Sequencing of the generation developments \nand transmission system enhancement under the investment program is technically feasible \nand execution arrangements are satisfactory. A road map for renewable energy integration will \nbe refined under project 1 and implemented under the investment program.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n17.  An economic internal rate of return of 15.17% was calculated for project 1 by comparing \nwith- and without-project scenarios.23 Detailed cost\u2013benefit calculations confirm the economic \nviability and sustainability of the investments. A sensitivity and risk analysis demonstrates a \nrobust economic performance. \n \n18.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 4.34% for project 1.24 Financial viability was \nexamined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits on a with- and without-investment \nbasis. The financial analysis was carried out in real terms. The weighted average cost of capital \nwas calculated for each subproject and resulted in 1.06% for the overall project. Financial \nviability was assessed by comparing the weighted average cost of capital to the FIRR for each \n                                                \n23  Economic Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Financial Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nsubproject and for the aggregated project. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the project \nwill remain financially viable even under adverse scenarios. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n19.  CEB is a vertically integrated utility comprising six functional business units (FBUs). The \nSri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009 encourages efficiency improvements of CEB by regulating each \nFBU. The act empowers the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), an independent \nregulator  for  energy  and  water  established  under  the  PUCSL  Act,  2002,  to  regulate  the \nelectricity supply industry. PUCSL began regulating each FBU separately and issued individual \nlicenses. Financial accounts are segregated to allow each FBU to operate as a profit center, \nand  a  transfer-pricing  scheme  between  FBUs  was  developed.  However,  the  process  of \ndelegating day-to-day management and financial decision making to FBU heads is not complete \nand the transfer-pricing scheme between FBUs is not functioning properly. PUCSL established \na tariff methodology and a road map for tariff reforms and rebalancing. Three tariff filings were \nconducted and tariff determinations announced in 2011\u20132013.  \n \n20.  CEB  has  the  necessary  capacity  to  undertake  the  investment  program.  It  was  the \nimplementing agency for past ADB-financed projects and has managed investments funded by \nother development partners. The financial management assessment of CEB concludes that it \ncan fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the investment program. CEB regularly faces cash \nshortfalls because of low tariffs, expensive power generation, and expensive short-term loans. \nThese shortcomings need to be corrected. Under the 2009 act, all tariffs must reflect costs; and \nTreasury  will  bear  the  cost  of  any  government-approved  subsidy.  In  March  2008,  the \ngovernment introduced a new tariff structure that increased average retail tariffs by 30%. The \ngovernment has also restructured a portion of CEB\u2019s long-term debt. The tariff order issued by \nPUCSL in January 2011 increased the average electricity tariff by about 8%. In February 2012, \nPUCSL implemented a fuel adjustment formula for certain customer categories. In April 2013, \nretail electricity tariffs were increased by 35% on average. With the introduction of low-cost \ngeneration, cost recovery is anticipated from 2017. Details of CEB\u2019s financial management \nassessment are available in the facility administration manual and in the assessment of CEB\u2019s \nfinancial performance and projections.25 \n \n21.  All procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An \noversight role by ADB will ensure integrity in procurement and implementation activities. CEB \nmaintains a project website that will be updated regularly and include (i) bidding procedures, \nbidders, and contract awards; (ii) use of funds disbursed under the project; and (iii) physical \nprogress.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and CEB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the facility administration manual (footnote 22). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  The MFF and project 1 will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty \nreduction, and social well-being by increasing access to electricity, reducing system losses, and \nimproving the quality of electricity.26 Greater access to a stable supply of electricity will promote \nbusiness expansion and increase jobs, which will help reduce poverty. The MFF\u2019s projects are \n                                                \n25  Summary of CEB\u2019s historical financial performance and projections available in the financial analysis (footnote 24). \n26   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nexpected to generate jobs for skilled and unskilled laborers during construction. Expansion of \nthe 33 kV network will improve access to electricity and quality of supply for about 300,000 \ncustomers  in rural  areas  and  small  towns.  This  will  enhance  the  living  standards  of  rural \nhouseholds  and  benefit  rural  poor  women  as  they  are  especially  affected  by  the  lack  or \nunreliable supply of electricity. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n23.  The  environment  assessment  and  review  framework,  resettlement  framework,  and \nindigenous peoples planning framework outline the environment and social safeguard principles \nand requirements.27 CEB will undertake environmental and social safeguard due diligence for \nindividual investments based on the three frameworks; and submit quarterly reports on the \nimplementation of environmental management plans (EMPs), resettlement plans for projects, \nand, if required, indigenous peoples plans. \n \n24.  Environment. Project 1 investments are classified category A for environment as they \ninclude construction of the  Moragolla hydropower plant.28 Other major components include \nconstruction  of  transmission  grid  substations  and  associated  transmission  lines  where \nconstruction work is limited to building foundations for transmission towers and substations. \nBased on CEB\u2019s environmental assessments and surveys, the hydropower plant may have \nconsiderable adverse environmental impacts; but the transmission and medium-voltage network \nwill  have  minimal  impact. The  environmental  impact  assessment for the  hydropower  plant \nassesses environmental impacts related to the construction, inundation of properties and forest \nhabitat,  and  others,  including  potential  effects  on  the  habitat  of  the  Green  Labeo  fish  in \nMahaweli River. CEB conducted several studies to comply with critical habitat tests and \u201cno net \nloss\u201d of biodiversity requirement as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Continuing \nconsultations are ongoing with wildlife stakeholder organizations, assessing reservoir safety, \nand developing an appropriate mechanism to guarantee downstream flows between CEB and \nthe Mahaweli Authority to maintain the endangered Green Labeo fish in the tailrace of the \nMoragolla  dam.  For  the  hydropower  plant  and  transmission  infrastructure,  anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  by  implementing  the  relevant  EMPs.  Budgetary \nprovisions  are  in  place  to  cover  the  environmental mitigation  and monitoring requirements \nincluding mitigation measures and institutional capacity development to manage environmental \nrisks  during  design,  construction,  and  operation.  CEB  has  adequate  institutional  capacity, \ncommitment, and experience to manage environmental risks during construction and operation \nof the  hydropower  plant.  EMP  mitigation measures  and  additional  requirements for  critical \nhabitat management will be incorporated into civil works contracts giving contractors the primary \nresponsibility for implementation during construction. CEB will supervise construction and EMP \nimplementation. The contractors and CEB will adhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  and  national  environmental  regulations.  In  compliance  with  ADB  public  disclosure \nrequirements, the environmental impact assessment and relevant EMPs for project 1 were \ndisclosed  on  24  February  2014.  Project  2  is  expected  to  be  classified  category  A  for \nenvironment due to the inclusion of transmission infrastructure for power evacuation from the \nproposed wind parks.29 \n \n25.  Involuntary  resettlement.  Project  1  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement. The Moragolla hydropower plant component will have considerable impact on land \n                                                \n27  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Environmental Impact Assessment: Project 1 and Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Proposed Wind Parks in Mannar Area (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement, including physical and economic displacement.30 Plant \nconstruction will require 38.24 hectares of private land and will impact 86 households (308 \npeople). The acquisition of 2.92 hectares of private land for construction of transmission grid \nsubstations and medium-voltage gantries will not result in any physical displacement. Where \nnew grid substations are built on commercial and private land, compensation will be paid to the \nowners at replacement cost. The transmission and distribution lines primarily cross public and \nunused lands. Construction will be carried out during non-cropping seasons. Where cropland is \naffected, compensation at replacement cost will be paid. Budgetary provisions are in place to \ncompensate affected people for these losses if and when they occur. Special attention will be \npaid to addressing gender equity issues in the resettlement framework. Additional assistance \nwill be given to vulnerable households including those headed by women. Social surveys and \nconsultations were undertaken in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe loan agreements will include a standard assurance related to core labor standards for \ncontractors,  including  equal  pay  for  equal  types  of  work,  and  an  awareness  program  on \nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. Project 1 is classified category C for indigenous \npeoples, as no indigenous peoples will be affected. \n \n26.  Climate  change  impact.  Project  1\u2019s  renewable  energy  intervention  will  bring  an \nadditional 97.7 gigawatt-hours of hydropower generation to the grid per year, equivalent to \navoiding about 72,272 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year for the useful life of the plant. \nAn  average  annual  reduction  of  about  98,400  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  may  be \nachieved  through  technical  loss  reduction  from  the  improved  energy  efficiency  of  the \ntransmission and distribution infrastructure. The climate change risk screening confirms that \nMFF components have low climate change risks.31 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  Governance risk stems from CEB having insufficient cash to fund its operations (para. \n20). Risks to project implementation include potential technical problems integrating renewable \n(primarily wind) energy with the grid and cost escalation. Environmental risk includes reduced \nwater flow in Mahaweli River during the dry season. These risks appear to be moderate and \nmay be mitigated by (i) ensuring progress on power reforms, and government efforts to increase \nsupply capacity and reduce generation costs; (ii) addressing wind integration  requirements \nunder the renewable energy master plan and system stability studies; (iii) closely supervising \nimplementation  and  advance  contracting;  and  (iv)  developing  appropriate  mechanisms  to \nguarantee downstream flows during the dry season between CEB and the Mahaweli Authority to \nmaintain the endangered Green Labeo fish in the tailrace. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare described in the risk assessment and risk management plan (Table 4).32 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInsufficient cash  Progress on energy sector reforms, including an independent energy sector \ngeneration by CEB to  regulatory framework, rationalizing tariff structures, and internal structural \nfund its operations  reforms in CEB; and commissioning low-cost generation, including from \nhydropower and other renewable energy sources \nPotential difficulties  Addressing wind integration requirements under the renewable energy \nmanaging the grid due  master plan and system stability studies prepared under ADB technical \nto instability as a result  assistance, investment for renewable energy integration proposed under the \n                                                \n30 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Climate Change Risk Assessment: Moragalla Hydropower Plant (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nof integrating renewable  MFF tranches, and changes proposed in regulatory codes and commercial \nwind generation  arrangements \nCost escalation  Close supervision by the steering committee and ADB, open and transparent \ncompetitive bidding, proactive project implementation, advance contracting, \ninclusion of physical and price contingencies in the cost estimates \nReduced water flow  Development of an appropriate mechanism to guarantee downstream flows \nduring the dry season in  between CEB and the Mahaweli Authority to maintain the endangered Green \nMahaweli River   Labeo fish in the tailrace  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEB = Ceylon Electricity Board, MFF = multitranche financing facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n28.  The government and CEB have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. The government \nand  CEB  have  given  ADB  certain  undertakings  for  the  MFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the \nframework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government and CEB with \nrespect to MFF individual tranches are set forth in the loan and project agreements for the \nrespective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n29.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove  \n \n(a)  the multitranche financing facility to the  Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \nLanka for the Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement \nInvestment  Program  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $360,000,000 which comprises: \n \n(i)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest \nand other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB's applicable \npolicies relating to Special Funds resources;  \n(ii)  the provision of loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest \nand  other  terms to  be determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and \n(iii)  the administration of cofinancing to be provided by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement and any other development partner  \n \nand  is  subject  to  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented \nto the Board; and \n \n(b)  the proposal in paragraph 13 of this report to permit procurement in non-member \ncountries  of  ADB  of  goods,  works,  and  services  produced  in  non-member \ncountries of ADB. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n24 June 2014 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact    (For all indicators)  Assumptions \nIncreased access  System supply capacity  CEB annual report  The government remains \nto clean and  increased to 6,367 MW by  (power statistics)  committed to power reforms \nreliable power  2020 (baseline 2012:   and development of renewable \nProgress reports on \nsupply  3,312 MW)   energy sources. \n10-year \nElectrification rate increased  A conducive regulatory \ndevelopment \nto 100% access to all by 2016  environment is adopted for \nframework \n(baseline 2012: 94%)  private sector involvement in \n \nIn-grid energy supply from  developing renewable energy. \nnonconventional renewable  Risks \nenergy sources increased to  Increase in fuel oil costs, \n10.0% by 2016 and 20.0% by  reliance on expensive thermal \n2020 (baseline 2012: 6.4%)  electricity generation, and \n  tariffs set below supply cost \nwill impact CEB operation and \nfinancial capacity. \nUnfavorable changes in global \nfinancial and economic \nenvironment may adversely \naffect the domestic economy. \nOutcome    (For all indicators)  Assumptions \nEnhanced clean  Total losses of the CEB  CEB annual report  Least-cost generation \npower generation,  network reduced to 10.00% of  (power statistics)  expansion plan, including \nsystem efficiency,  net generation by 2020  generation from renewable \nProgress reports on \nand reliability   (baseline 2012: 10.67%)  sources, implemented as \n10-year \nscheduled. \nTransmission infrastructure for  development \nconnecting 200 MW of wind  framework  The government continues to \npower to the grid completed  fund extension and \nCEB monthly \nby December 2018  strengthening of the grid. \nsystem reports \n97.7 GWh clean hydropower  Risk \n \ngeneration per year, resulting  Integration of intermittent wind \n \nin annual avoided emissions  generation may create \nof 72,272 tons of carbon  potential difficulties in \ndioxide, added to the system  managing the grid.  \nby June 2019  \nDistribution line-end voltage \nfluctuation maintained within \n5% in project areas by \nDecember 2018 (baseline \n2013: 10%) \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
