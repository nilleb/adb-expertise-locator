INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  2011\u20132020  Strategic  Framework  for  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  Program  (CAREC  2020)1 has  two  objectives:  trade  expansion  and \nimproving  industrial  competitiveness.  Trade  facilitation  is  one  of  the  CAREC\u2019s  four  priority \nsectors. Work in this area is guided by the Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy (TTFS), \napproved in 2007 by the 6th CAREC Ministerial Conference, and the TTFS Implementation \nAction Plan, endorsed at the 7th CAREC Ministerial Conference on 21 November 2008 in Baku, \nAzerbaijan.2 The TTFS adopts an integrated approach, focusing on the development of six \nCAREC corridors through infrastructure investments and trade facilitation initiatives to improve \nthe movement of goods through these corridors and across borders. The TTFS stipulates that a \nmidterm review is to be conducted during 2013\u20132014 to optimize and align implementation with \nCAREC  2020.  Initially,  the  trade  facilitation  agenda  for  CAREC  was  focused  on  customs \ncooperation.  However,  the  adoption  of  an  integrated  trade  facilitation  agenda  requires \naddressing a wider spectrum of issues, including cooperative efforts from all agencies working \nat borders, such as those responsible for applying sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures. \nIn this regard, streamlining and simplifying SPS procedures in accordance with international \nstandards will facilitate the movement of food and agricultural products along CAREC corridors. \nTransparency and clarity of SPS regulations will help companies to make efficient business \ndecisions and comply with requirements, thereby enhancing their competitiveness.  \n \n2.  In early 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted initial analyses of SPS \nmeasures of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and \nUzbekistan. Consultations were held with representatives of each country\u2019s customs authority; \nSPS enquiry points (for World Trade Organization [WTO] member countries); ministries of \neconomy and trade, agriculture, and health; and national chambers of commerce and industry. \nThe findings and recommendations of the analysis were discussed during a workshop held in \nBangkok, Thailand on 25\u201326 July 2012. All CAREC countries participated, and countries that \nwere  not  visited  for  the  analysis  made  presentations  on  the  SPS  policies  and  practices \nprevailing in their countries. The workshop was also attended by representatives of the United \nNations Food and Agricultural Organization, United Nations Economic and Social Commission \nfor Asia and the Pacific, and the WTO\u2019s Standards and Trade Development Facility. Detailed \nminutes  and  next  steps  were  discussed  and  endorsed  by  CAREC  governments.  An  SPS \ndevelopment  plan  for  CAREC  suggests  a  series  of  regional  actions  to  modernize  SPS \nmeasures and their application.3 This technical assistance (TA) project has been designed at \nthe request of the CAREC countries to support SPS cooperation in the CAREC region.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  All countries maintain sanitary (animal health) and phytosanitary (plant health) measures \nto ensure that food is safe for consumers, and to prevent the spread of pests or diseases \namong animals and plants. These SPS measures can take many forms, such as requiring that \nproducts come from a disease-free area, inspecting products, specific treatment or processing \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2012.

Modernizing SPS Measures to Facilitate Trade in Agricultural and Food Products: Report on the \nDevelopment of a Sanitary and Phytosanitary Plan for the CAREC Countries. Manila. \n4 The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 June \n2013. \n ", "2  \nof products, setting allowable maximum levels of pesticide residues, or limiting the permitted \nuse of additives in food. SPS measures apply to domestically produced food or local animal and \nplant diseases, as well as to products coming from other countries. SPS measures help ensure \nthat agricultural commodities are safe for consumers, and help prevent the spread of pests and \ndiseases across borders.  \n \n4.  SPS measures by their nature may restrict trade. Governments accept that some trade \nrestrictions may be necessary to ensure food safety and animal and plant health protection. \nHowever, governments are sometimes pressured to go beyond what is needed for health \nprotection and use SPS restrictions to shield domestic producers from economic competition. In \nthe CAREC region, some SPS measures are imposed for legitimate purposes, while others \nhave become an obstacle for importing and exporting firms, and thus act to constrain rather \nthan facilitate trade. SPS measures that are poorly designed and adopted\u2014with little private \nsector consultation\u2014serve to harm competitiveness by constraining the ability of companies to \noutsource key  inputs  and  placing them  at  a competitive  disadvantage  in international  and \nregional markets.  \n \n5.  The regulatory framework for SPS administration and application in post-Soviet Union \nCAREC  countries  has  been  essentially  unchanged  since  the  Soviet  era,  and  is  not  fully \nconsistent with international best practice. These countries continue to use the state standards \n(GOST) established by the former Soviet Union, which provide insufficient protection for human, \nplant and animal health; they are not recognized by most of the world\u2019s trading countries, \nforming  an  obstacle  to  market  access  beyond  Soviet  successor  states.  The  WTO  SPS \nAgreement, which applies to both WTO members and non-members, is widely considered \ninternational  best  practice  and  covers  product  criteria;  quarantine  measures;  processing \nrequirements; and certification, inspection, and testing. The GOST-based standards differ from \nthose used in the WTO-based global trading system and are not WTO-compliant. The recent \naccession of Russia to the WTO will prompt Russia to modernize its SPS measures in line with \ninternational standards, requiring its CAREC (and other) trading partners to adopt international \nstandards as well, or face the prospect of losing access to the Russian market.5 \n \n6.  To  increase  access  to  other  markets,  CAREC  countries  must  improve  their \ncompetitiveness. One key challenge is to strengthen their SPS management capacities and to \nadopt standards and practices compatible with international norms. A strong policy base and \nregulatory infrastructure for risk-based controls able to complete the transition from the former \nSoviet system must be established. In this regard, it is essential to identify legislative, regulatory, \nand procedural gaps between regulations set out in the WTO SPS Agreement and the existing \nsituation in each CAREC country. \n \n7.  At most CAREC borders, in addition to customs formalities, it is necessary to comply \nwith a range of procedures\u2014including animal quarantine and inspection of plants and other \nagricultural products\u2014according to the SPS system in place. Simplification and harmonization \nof these procedures are at the core of trade facilitation in the CAREC region. SPS agencies \nshould be actively engaged in initiatives designed to rationalize and improve the coordination of \nborder management modernization efforts. It is important to identify key needs, opportunities, \nand good practices to enhance the effective engagement of SPS agencies in collaborative and \ncoordinated  border  management.  In  a  coordinated  border  management  approach,  it  is \nnecessary to address the relations among SPS agencies, other border agencies, and private \n                                                 \n5 The Russian Federation joined the WTO on 22 August 2012. \n ", "  3\nstakeholders. In CAREC countries, customs and SPS agencies cooperate very little as duties \nare performed separately and guided by agency mandates. \n \n8.  Countries in the same region\u2014with similar agro-ecosystems, products and agricultural \npractices\u2014often experience similar animal and plant health and food safety problems. In fact, \nsome countries may combat many of the same crop and livestock pests and diseases. In this \nregard,  regional  cooperation  and  coordination  is  important  for  effective  food  safety  and \nagricultural health management. CAREC countries have an additional incentive to seek regional \ncoordination: they share the legacy of the GOST system and currently face common reform-\nrelated challenges. They will benefit from a timely exchange of information and experiences. In \naddition, a regional focus is more efficient and brings economies of scale, through sharing of \nexpertise and facilities.  \n \n9.  The skills available in CAREC countries may be insufficient to manage and protect \nhuman and agricultural health in a way that meets requirements under the SPS Agreement.  A \nlack  of  technical  expertise  may  also  compromise  industry  competitiveness.  The  long-term \ndevelopment and retention of skilled personnel in the areas of food safety and animal and plant \nhealth are essential for the improvement and maintenance of a higher-level SPS capacity. \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is to foster a 20% increase in inter- and intra-regional trade in \nagriculture and food products by 2017 (compared with 2012) through the streamlining of SPS \nmeasures. The TA outcome is that by 2015, CAREC governments will design and implement a \ncoordinated SPS reform agenda consistent with international standards and identify critical \ninvestments  in  SPS  for  trade  facilitation.  Specifically,  this  TA  will  support  collective  and \ncoordinated efforts to improve implementation of SPS measures throughout the CAREC region. \nThe TA will (i) promote concerted reforms and modernization in the SPS area consistent with \ninternational standards; and (ii) identify and prioritize investment needs to modernize SPS \nmeasures and their application. To increase the knowledge and capabilities of CAREC countries \nto design, comply with, and implement SPS measures, CAREC Institute resources will be \nleveraged to support delivery of priority training. Collaboration with development partners active \nin modernizing SPS measures to facilitate trade (the WTO\u2019s Standards and Trade Development \nFacility and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) will be pursued to initiate a \nseries of capacity-development programs. \n \n11.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through delivery of the following \noutputs: \n(i)  review of laws and regulations governing the oversight and application of SPS \nmeasures, \n(ii)  establishment of an inventory of laboratory infrastructure in the region, and \n(iii)  research  to  help  expand  ADB\u2019s  support  for  regional  improvement  of  border \nservices to develop specialized border crossing points for priority handling of \nperishables and other goods and commodities subject to SPS measures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The following activities will be undertaken under the TA: \n \n ", "4  \n(i)  The  laws  and  regulations  governing  the  oversight  and  application  of  SPS \nmeasures in CAREC countries will be reviewed to identify priority reforms of SPS \nregulations  and  procedures  that  will  make  the  largest  contribution  to  the \nfacilitation of trade and serve to regionally harmonize selected SPS regulations. \nSPS regulations and procedures that contribute most to trade facilitation will be \nidentified. In this regard, private sector stakeholders (e.g., the CAREC Federation \nof Carrier and Forwarder Associations, growers and producers of goods and \ncommodities  subject  to  SPS  measures,  and  privately  owned  and  operated \nlaboratories  conducting  SPS-related  tests)  will  be  consulted  to  identify \nopportunities for the private sector to help modernize and apply SPS measures.  \nAn analysis will be conducted to identify legislative, regulatory, and procedural \ngaps between regulations set out in the SPS Agreement (international standards) \nand  the  existing  situation  in  each  CAREC  country.  Based  on  the regulatory \nreview,  recommendations  on  harmonization  of  selected  regulations  will  be \nprovided for discussion and validation by various stakeholders. \n(ii)  An inventory of laboratory infrastructure in the region will be conducted; based on \nthe  inventory  findings,  an  investment  program  to  upgrade  and  modernize \nlaboratory infrastructure to serve regional demand along the CAREC corridors \nwill be developed. The cargo movements of goods subject to SPS measures \nalong CAREC corridors will be analyzed to assess SPS laboratory infrastructure \nserving these corridors better and rationalize and/or upgrade facilities serving \nregional demand. \n(iii)  Studies  will  be  conducted  to  identify  how  SPS  agencies  can  enhance  their \nengagement  in  coordinated  border  management,  including  by  evaluating \nrelations  between  SPS  agencies  and  other  border  agencies.  The  use  of \ntechnology for SPS control to link SPS agency systems with customs will be \nassessed, and ways to reduce duplication of SPS control tasks and exchange of \ninformation between SPS agencies in exporting and importing countries will be \nidentified. Key border points for priority handling of goods subject to SPS controls \nwill also be identified to help expand ADB\u2019s support for regional improvement of \nborder services. A concluding conference reporting on the consultants\u2019 findings \nwill be conducted together with SPS agencies and customs administrations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $560,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund and \nadministered by ADB. The CAREC governments will provide counterpart support in the form of \nnecessary office space, counterpart staff and other services to the consultants, assistance in \narranging meetings with counterpart agencies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Public  Management,  Financial  Sector  and \nRegional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will administer and implement \nthe TA in close coordination with the CAREC Unit of the Central and West Asia Department,  \nthe concerned resident missions in CAREC countries, and the CAREC Institute (to coordinate \nits delivery of priority training). The implementation period is expected to cover 18 months, from \n1 July 2013 to 31 December 2014. During the implementation period, specialized agencies such \nas the Food and Agricultural Organization and WTO\u2019s  Standards and Trade  Development \nFacility will be consulted and technical inputs from them will be collected. \n ", "  5\n \n15.  A team of four international consultants (11 person-months) and two national consultants \n(10 person-months) will be required to provide advisory and technical services under the TA. \nOutline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  The international consultants will be specialists in the areas of plant health, animal \nhealth, and food safety. They will be supervised by ADB\u2019s task managers. A lead expert will \nserve  as  team  leader  responsible  for  coordinating  a  small  team  of  experts  that  will  work \nprimarily in the field. The reporting requirements will generally include inception, interim, and \nfinal reports. In addition to their professional contributions, all consultants and resource persons \nare to assist ADB in disseminating best practices and supporting high-level policy dialogues \nthrough knowledge products such as strategic publications, policy, and strategy papers.  \n \n17.  National  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  international  consultants  by \nresearching  and  compiling  relevant  documents  and  information,  translating  documents, \norganizing the concluding conference, and providing administrative and logistical support. The \nnational  consultants  will  have  extensive,  in-depth  regional  and  local  knowledge  and  good \ncontacts in the areas of SPS and trade facilitation. The national consultants will be supervised \nby the international consultants and the ADB task managers. \n \n18.  ADB will endeavor to recruit a firm to assemble the consulting team. However, due to the \nspecialized nature of the assignment, it may be necessary to recruit qualified individuals. For \nrecruitment of a firm, the preferred selection method is quality- and cost-based selection, with a \nquality-cost ratio of 80:20. If no suitable firms can provide the required expertise, consultants \nmay be hired individually. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n19.  The TA outputs, and particularly the findings and recommendations from assessments \nand studies, will be disseminated and discussed at the concluding conference, CAREC senior \nofficials\u2019 meeting, and ministerial conference, and via the CAREC program website. \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the CAREC \nprogram\u2019s Trade Facilitation priority area, to be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund,  for  Promoting \nCooperation  in  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  Measures  for  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Risks\nImpact      Assumption \nCAREC governments  By 2017, streamlined SPS  National and regional  Regional cooperation in \nwill increase inter-  measures foster a 20%  trade statistics  SPS will remain a \nand intra-regional  increase in inter- and     priority in the \ntrade in agriculture  intra-regional trade in  UNCTAD trade data  development agenda of \nand food products    agriculture and food    the CAREC \nproducts compared to the  CAREC corridors  governments in the \n2012 baseline  performance  framework of trade \nmeasurement and  facilitation \nmonitoring   \nRisk \nGovernments do not \nreach an agreement on \npriority reform areas  \nOutcome      Assumption \nCAREC governments  By 2015, CAREC  Progress reports to the  Appropriate enabling \ndesign and  governments have  CAREC senior officials\u2019  environment for policy \nimplement a  coordinated SPS reform  meeting and ministerial  and reform formulation \ncoordinated SPS  agendas in place and are  conferences  in place within CAREC \nreform agenda  implementing them  countries  \nconsistent with   \ninternational  Risk \nstandards and  Insufficient coordination \nidentify critical  among key ministries \ninvestments in SPS  and government \nfor trade facilitation  agencies involved in \ntrade facilitation to carry \nthrough with needed \nreforms  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
