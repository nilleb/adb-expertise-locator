An initial environmental examination was undertaken and a \nAssessment  summary  is  in  supplementary  appendix,  along  with  environmental \nassessment and review procedures. \n   \nProject Description  The Commercial Agriculture Development Project will reduce poverty in \n11  districts  in  the  Eastern  Development  Region  (EDR)  of  Nepal, \nincluding  5  hill  districts  (Dhankuta,  Ilam,  Panchtar,  Terhathum,  and \nUdayapur), 5 terai (lowland) districts (Jhapa, Morang, Saptari, Siraha, \nand Sunsari), and 1 mountain district (Taplejung). Poverty reduction will \nbe  realized  by  targeting  poor  areas  and  expanding  the  economic \nopportunities of the rural poor, closely involving the poor and other \nstakeholders in project activities, catalyzing private sector investment in \nagriculture, and strengthening the capacity of local institutions. \n \nThe  Project  is  market  oriented  and  demand  driven.  The  project \nimplementation plans respond to local needs and priorities identified \nthrough the active participation of market-chain stakeholders. Project \nsupport  will  be  provided  by  partnering  with  local  nongovernment \norganizations  and  through  district  farmer  production  and  marketing \ngroups.  The  pace  of  implementation  will  be  linked  to  the  rate  of \ndevelopment of local capacity. A primary focus will be helping farmers \nbecome  more  knowledgeable,  capable,  and  competitive  within  the \nmarket  chain  to  secure  improved  incomes.  Investment  in  local \ninfrastructure in the form of collection and storage centers, cool stores, \naccess  to  market  information  and  agribusiness  and/or  product \nimprovement technology will be provided. Attention will also be given to \ntraders and processors to improve the quality and regularity of supply of \nproducts purchased by them and to encourage their investment in the \nmarket chain through linkages to farmers, such as contract farming \narrangements.  The  Project  contains  a  strong  social  inclusion \ncomponent  to  help  subsistence  and  semicommercial  farmers  adopt \nhigh-value  crops  (HVCs)  for  improved  returns,  and  to  become \ncommercial. The landless will be assisted through training to become \nemployed in market-chain activities. \n   \nRationale  Despite the lackluster performance overall of the agriculture sector, \nHVCs have a high growth rate and offer higher levels of income per \nhectare. This is of importance to small landholders who are producing \ncereals  with  relatively  low  returns.  Marketing  of  all  crops  including \nHVCs  is  constrained  by  weak  market-chain  linkages  and  the  weak \ninterface  farmers  have  with  their  markets.  Lack  of  knowledge  and \n ", "iv \ncapability makes farmers vulnerable to exploitation, limits their returns, \nand depresses productivity. The Project aims to accelerate the process \nof  agricultural  commercialization  in  the  EDR  by  building  on  earlier \nproject  initiatives,  and  responding  to  the  needs  of  stakeholders  by \nstrengthening  their  linkages  and  ensuring  fairer  benefits  to  poor \ndisadvantaged  communities  and  women.  The  project  design  is \nconsistent  with  Government  policies  and  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) strategies for development as expressed in the ADB country \nstrategy and program for Nepal. \n   \nImpact and  The Project will result in reduced poverty in rural communities of the 11 \nOutcome  EDR districts through equitable and sustainable commercialization of \nagriculture. The outcomes of the Project will be improved efficiency of \nmarketing and processing of HVCs, such as vegetables, fruits, tea, and \nspices in the EDR. The Project will increase (i) employment in rural \nareas, (ii) value added of agriculture products, and (iii) rural incomes. \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $24.1  million, \nPlan  including taxes and duties of $0.3 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A grant not exceeding the equivalent of $18.0 million will be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \n  Total \nSource  ($ million)  % \nAsian Development Bank  18.0  74.7\nGovernment of Nepal  0.8  3.2\nCommercial Agriculture Alliance General Members  4.0  16.6\nDistrict Development Committees  0.8  3.3\nFarmer Communities  0.5  2.2\n  Total    24.1  100.0\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives \n   \nImplementation  Commercial Agriculture Alliance, a not-for-profit company, has been \nArrangements  established  to  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  component  1  on \ncommercial agriculture investment and management. The alliance, with \nan  elected  board  and  a  management  team  headed  by  a  general \nmanager, will have a branch in each of the 11 project districts headed \nby  a  branch  manager.  The  Department  of  Agriculture  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency for the other components. A project management \nunit  will  be  established  in  Biratnagar  to  be  headed  by  a  project \nmanager.  At  the  central  level,  a  project  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished, chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and \nCooperatives. \n ", "v \nProcurement  The project management unit will be responsible for procurement of all \ngoods and services under the Project, following ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2006).  Supply  contracts  for  equipment  or  materials \nestimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  through \ninternational competitive bidding, and those costing less than $500,000 \n(other than minor items) will be awarded through limited international \nbidding. Shopping procedures will be applied for small or off-the-shelf \nitems valued at less than $100,000. Procurement by recipients of the \ncommercial  agricultural  fund  (to  be  established  by  the  Project), \nincluding civil works, will follow the financial intermediaries method. \n   \nConsulting Services  The consulting services will mainly cover market-chain development, \nsocial  inclusion  and  participation,  agribusiness  development, \ncommercial  agriculture  fund  analysis  and  advisory,  community \nsubproject  investment,  market  information  and  promotion,  training \ndesign, monitoring and evaluation, and environmental impact analysis \nand  monitoring.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \ninternational project adviser (team leader) and the domestic deputy \nteam  leader  will  be  recruited  individually.  The  least  cost  selection \nmethod will be used to select consultants or service providers for (i) \ntraining and workshops; and (ii) surveys, monitoring and evaluation. \nOther consultants will be recruited through a firm using quality- and \ncost-based selection. \n   \nProject Benefits  The Project will reduce rural poverty in the EDR through equitable and \nand Beneficiaries  sustainable commercialization of agriculture. Impacts include increased \neconomic  activities  and  jobs  in  the  project  area.  Social  inclusion \nactivities will promote the participation of all stakeholders including the \npoor, disadvantaged, and women in commercial agriculture; help them \nreceive fair benefits from such participation; and in turn contribute to \nrestoring  peace  and  stability  in  the  EDR.  The  Project  will  directly \ngenerate  employment  opportunities  for  subsistence  stakeholders  by \npromoting HVC production and marketing, transporting products from \nthe field to storage and processing centers, and assisting small-scale \ncommunity-based  market  infrastructure  development.  The  landless \npoor will, through skill-based training, be made more employable and \ncapable  of  income  generation.  Commercial  stakeholders  will  be \nassisted to add value to agriculture products and encouraged to adopt \nsocially inclusive behavior to help the less advantaged. \n   \nRisks and  The  current  ceasefire  and  ongoing  talks  between  the  Government, \nAssumptions  political parties, and insurgents are encouraging for Nepal\u2019s future. The \nProject-specific conflict impact assessment finds that projects focusing \non quick impact activities, implemented by local agencies, and with \nflexible design and full transparency can operate in conflict-affected \nareas. These recommendations are incorporated in the project design. \n \nThe capacity of institutions and individuals to adapt to the Project\u2019s \ndemand-driven and socially inclusive approach is identified as a risk as \nit requires a change in the way service providers operate and behave. \nThis  is  true  for  both  public  service  providers  and  nongovernment \norganizations. Attitudinal change takes time and to facilitate this change \nthe Project supports capacity development at all levels and among all \nstakeholders through immersion training and ongoing dialogue. \n ", "81o  00'E 85 o 00'E 86 o 30'E  88 o 00'E \nMIDWESTERN\nDEVELOPMENT\nMAHAKALI REGION PEOPOLEF' S C  HRIENPAUBLIC NEPAL\n29 o 00'N SETI KARNALI WESTERN 29 o 00'N\nDFEAVRREWELGEOSIPOTMNEERNNT BHERI RAPTI DHAWALANGIGRIEANPDDAAEKVLRIEELGOBIPAOMGNEMNATTI DEVEREAELSGOTIEPORMNNENT COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nLUMBINI Kathmandu A PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\n27 o 00'N I N D I A DEVCEENLNAOTRPRAMAYALENNIT JANAKPUR SAGARMATH KOSHMIEC2H7I o 00'N 28 o 00'N  OF  CHINA 28 o 00'N \nREGION\nProject Area\n81o  00'E 85 o 00'E\nSOLUKHUMBU\nLukla\nCENTRAL\nSANKHUWASABHA\nN DEVELOPMENT TAPLEJUNG\nREGION Salleri EASTERN  DEVELOPMENT  REGION\n0 10 20 30 40\nKandbari Taplejung\nKilometers Okhaldhunga Sapalakhu\nOKHALDHUNGA\nKOSHI\nProject District (Terai) Bhaduare Diktel\nProject District (Hills) Bhojpur TERHATHUM PANCHTAR I N D I A\nKHOTANG Terhathum\nProject District (Mountain) BHOJPUR\nPhidim\nNon-Project District SAGARMATHA Basantpur\nNational Capital DHANKUTA\nDistrict Capital UDAYAPUR\nMECHI\nCity/Town Dhankuta Ilam\nEast-West Highway ILAM\nNational Road SIRAHA Gaighat Dharan\nOther Road\nSUNSARI\nDistrict Boundary\nItahari\nZone Boundary Siraha Rupani\nRegional Boundary Inaruwa Maikhola Kakarbita\nSAPTARI MORANG\nInternational Boundary Chandragadhi\nJHAPA\n26 o 30'N Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Commercial Agriculture Development Project.1 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Agriculture is the main sector of the Nepalese economy, contributing about 38% of the \ngross domestic product (GDP).2 However, the sector\u2019s performance has been below the 4.15% \nannual growth anticipated in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007), achieving only 2.6% during \nFY2002\u20132005 and 3.1% in FY2005. Agriculture GDP per hectare (ha) is $649, but 40% of \nagricultural households have less than 0.5 ha, and access to land correlates closely with the \nincidence of poverty. Rural poverty at 44% is almost twice as high as urban poverty at 23%. \n \n3.  A large part of Nepal\u2019s rural population (approximately 88%) remains either directly \nengaged in or dependent on agriculture for sustenance, despite the shift in economic structure \nfrom agriculture to services and industry. The share of the labor force directly employed in \nagriculture decreased during 1996\u20132004 from 83% to 71%, exacerbated by the recent conflict, \nwhich has driven people to the security of towns. \n \n4.  Despite the overall slow progress of the agriculture sector, high-value crops (HVCs) \nincluding off-season vegetables, spices, medicinal plants, tea, coffee, honey, and mushrooms, \nprovide grounds for optimism. With a favorable climate and large variations of microclimates, \nNepal has the potential to produce a range of HVCs. Internally, the market for fresh, convenient \nHVC  products  is  growing.  Nepal  is  a  rapidly  urbanizing  country;  50%  of  the  population \n(projected to be 30 million) will live in urban areas by 2035 (as compared to 20% currently) and \nwill consume a large amount of HVCs. \n \n5.  Potential  large  markets  exist  in  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  and  India  where  off-season \nvegetables fetch high prices. The Department of Agriculture (DOA) projects that exports of \nHVCs to neighboring urban markets in India will increase from a base of 12,700 tons in 2001 by \n105% by 2010, and a further 188% to 65,000 tons by 2020. Clearly, India offers Nepal huge \nmarket opportunities (at least 100 million Indian people cannot be supplied by hill areas in their \nown country). When supply is low and prices are high in India, Nepalese farmers can sell with \nan  advantage.  As  a  result,  HVCs  are  growing  faster  than  cereals  and  now  comprise \napproximately 13% of the cultivated land area. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Constraints to the Commercialization of Agriculture \n6.  While HVCs offer farmers significantly higher returns, the products are perishable, prices \nare volatile, and the marketing process is time critical. A dysfunctional marketing chain results in \nlosses, and farmers may perceive high risks in changing to HVCs. Technology constraints from \nproduction to consumption, along with insufficient and poorly shared market information, a lack \n                                                 \n1  A project preparatory technical assistance was provided.

Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Nepal. Manila. \n ", "2   \nof  product  standardization,  and  inadequate  quality  assurance  systems  hinder  commercial \nagriculture development. Insufficient knowledge and infrastructure (rural roads and access to \nhighways, collection centers, cool and cold stores, and rural transport), and inefficient water \nresource management and crop variety selection affect farmers. \n \n7.  In addition, most farmers are smallholders and are often isolated or organized in small \ngroups. They sell small quantities in the peak season and have difficulty accessing inputs, \ncredit,  and  technology.  Their  limited  knowledge  of  technology  and  market  requirements  is \nreflected  in  low  production  and  low  quality.  Processors  complain  of  small,  disaggregated \namounts  of  product,  irregularity  of  supply,  and  poor  product  quality.  Both  farmers  and \nprocessors will be able to benefit from value-added agriculture products if the market chain is \ndeveloped, and technology and infrastructure assistance are provided. \n \n2.  Existing Initiatives and Emerging Needs \n8.  HVCs  can  provide  much  higher  income  than  cereal  crops.  HVCs  are  particularly \nappropriate for smallholder farmers (0.5 ha or less), because they are labor intensive and offer \nhigher  returns  per  ha.  Studies  show  that  households  growing  at  least  some  HVCs  have \nsignificantly higher net incomes than those only producing food grains.3  \n \n9.  Although the public sector has played a role in HVC adoption and commercialization, the \ncontributions of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the private sector have, on balance, \nbeen more significant. Vegetables, tea, and potatoes are examples of where largely private \ninvestment in storage and processing has resulted in strengthened value chains. Farmer groups \ninvesting in localized storage have obtained improved returns by aggregating and holding their \nproducts, and selling in the off-season. The Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal indicates \nstrong demand for credit for community-based storage facilities. Farm-to-highway linkages in \nthe form of roads or bridges built and maintained by the community are also in demand and \nhave substantial economic impact on communities. \n \n10.  Emerging stakeholder initiatives and opportunities for agriculture commercialization are \nparticularly  apparent  in  the  Eastern  Development  Region  (EDR)  (Appendix  2).  The  EDR \ncomprises three zones: Koshi, Mechi, and Sagarmatha. In each zone, a north\u2013south road \nconnects the hill districts with the terai (lowlands).4 Various HVCs are grown along the road \ncorridor. Some farm-to-market roads are either already  constructed or planned to connect \nimportant production pockets with zonal roads, although many more are needed. Over 250 \nfarmer-managed irrigation systems have been improved or newly constructed, and about 4,000 \nshallow tubewells have been installed during the last 15 years. This has significantly increased \nirrigated areas along the road corridors and in potential production pockets. Improvement of an \nadditional 100 farmer-managed irrigation systems is under way. As most processing, marketing, \nand trading enterprises are located in the terai along the East-West Highway, irrigation and road \nconnectivity play an important role in increasing production and marketing of HVCs from the hill \ndistricts. \n \n11.  All EDR terai districts are connected to India and situated close to Bangladesh and \nBhutan. The EDR has been exporting vegetables, fruits, tea, and spices to these countries \n                                                 \n3  Department for International Development, Review of Agricultural Research Impact, 2005\u2014a survey of 13,987 \nhouseholds in 14 districts. \n4  Mechi Road connects all four districts: Ilam, Jhapa, Panchtar, and Taplejung; Koshi Road connects Dhankuta, \nMorang, Sunsari, and Terhathum; and Sagarmatha Road connects Siraha and Udayapur (Saptari is connected \nwith Siraha by the East\u2013West Highway). \n ", "    3 \nwhere  demand  is  high;  recent  data  indicate  that  production  and  marketing  of HVCs  have \nsignificantly increased.  \n \n12.  While leading the commercialization process in the EDR, the private sector, NGOs, \nfarmer production and marketing groups, cooperatives, and trade associations express the need \nto develop more mutually beneficial market-chain linkages. The private sector wants to explore \ncontract farming and other supply-based initiatives that have been successful in other countries. \nCurrently in Nepal and in the EDR, farmers are faced with market uncertainty for their products, \nand processors and traders are constrained by unreliable quantity and quality. This has slowed \nthe rate of commercialization of agriculture. Although some initiatives have already started to \nstrengthen linkages, the chains are loose and have largely bypassed the interest of smallholder \nfarmers and processors, poor and disadvantaged people, and women. \n \n3.  Government Policies and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n13.  During the 1990s the Government initiated (i) reforms to move toward a more market-\noriented economy, and (ii) devolution of responsibility to local bodies under the Local Self \nGovernance Act 1999. The 1995 Agriculture Perspective Plan and subsequent plans provide \nthe development framework. Agricultural growth is considered key to poverty reduction and the \nAgriculture Perspective Plan stresses diversification on the basis of geographic location and \ncommercialization of agroproducts. The ninth and tenth five-year plans (1996\u20132001 and 2002\u2013\n2007) draw on these strategies. To diversify and commercialize agriculture, the current strategic \napproach  includes  (i)  mobilizing  government  and  nongovernment  service  providers  in \npartnership and on a contractual basis, (ii) promoting cooperative and contractual farming, (iii) \ndevolving local agricultural programs to local bodies, (iv) strengthening agricultural research \nstations as resource centers, and (v) providing technical backstopping. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s 2005\u20132009 country strategy and program (CSP)5 for Nepal links future ADB \nassistance to results sought by the Government to deal with the underlying causes and possible \nlong-term  effects  of  the  recent  conflict.  Broad-based  and  inclusive  social  and  economic \ndevelopment to achieve a steady decline in poverty is the adopted strategy. The results are in \nline with the objectives of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy (Tenth Five-Year Plan), \nwhich  is  built  on  four  pillars:  (i)  broad-based  and  higher  economic  growth,  (ii)  social \ndevelopment, (iii) targeted programs for socially excluded groups, and (iv) good governance. \nThe main thrusts of the CSP are (i) promoting greater development balance in different regions; \n(ii) improving access of the poor to basic services, opportunities for social advancement, and \nparticipation in the development process; and (iii) addressing the needs of disadvantaged ethnic \ngroups, castes, and women. In project design, the CSP requires (i) simple design, (ii) service \ndelivery through local stakeholders, (iii) demand-driven assistance, (iv) results-focused support, \n(v) flexible implementation modalities, (vi) community participation with social inclusion in overall \nproject implementation, and (vii) greater transparency and accountability. These requirements \nguided design of the Project and are incorporated in its framework. \n \n4.  External Assistance \n15.  Agricultural projects implemented in Nepal (Appendix 3) have focused more on the \ntransfer of production technology than on developing commercial skills and linking farmers to \nmarkets. DOA capacity is still in that mode, although senior DOA personnel realize the need to \nbroaden DOA\u2019s skill base. A more balanced approach to development is now required, which \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Nepal. Manila. \n ", "4   \nincludes  social  mobilization,  selective  and  applied  research  (improved  seeds,  appropriate \nvarieties  and  agronomic  practices,  integrated  pest  management,  storage,  processing,  and \npackaging), agribusiness development (policy advocacy, providing entrepreneurs with business \ndevelopment advice), support for community-based storage and processing, and facilitating \nstrategic stakeholder partnerships including access to financial services. \n \n16.  During  implementation,  the  Project  will  establish  linkages  with  other  projects  with \nconnecting  functions  being  implemented  within  the  project  area.  The  Community-Managed \nIrrigated Agriculture Sector Project is developing an irrigated agriculture development strategy \nfor each district with community-based irrigation and associated infrastructure.6 The Community \nLivestock Development Project supports the development of local livestock product markets, \nand entrepreneurial processing and marketing activities.7 The World Bank-supported agricultural \ncommercialization and trade preparation studies include a review and recommendations for \nsanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards,  quality  control,  and  commercialization  strategies.  All \nthese interventions are relevant to the proposed Project. \n \n5.  Lessons  \n17.  The design of the Project takes into consideration lessons identified from earlier and \nongoing projects in Nepal and other countries, including the following: \n \n(i)  Involving  local  stakeholders  in  planning  and  implementation  is  critical  to \nachieving project objectives; the participation of key stakeholders is crucial to the \nownership of proposed changes. Commercial stakeholders in particular will not \naccept designs imposed upon them. \n(ii)  Partnership  arrangements  with  NGOs  and  the  private  sector  have  proved \nsuccessful; models can be adapted and institutionalized. \n(iii)  When farmers, marketers, processors, and consumers act together, beneficiary \nresponse and benefits increase. \n(iv)  Considering agriculture only from the perspective of production does not allow \ncommercialization objectives to be achieved. \n(v)  Traditionally, line agencies had responsibility for project implementation, but most \ndo not have the background or capacity to deal with sector linkages and the \nunderstanding to work effectively with the private sector. \n \n18.  The ongoing Crop Diversification Project (CDP),8 being implemented in 12 hill and terai \ndistricts in the mid- and far-western development regions, which were highly affected by the \ninsurgency, provides various useful lessons. The main thrust of the CDP is promoting public and \nprivate extension services for production and marketing of agricultural crops with a particular \nfocus  on  secondary  crops.  CDP  activities  are  based  on  a  farmer  group  approach  with \nparticipation  of  NGOs  and  private  service  providers,  and  involving  poor,  disadvantaged \ncommunities, and women in planning, implementation, and monitoring of field programs. This \nCDP modality, which is incorporated into the proposed Project\u2019s activities and implementation \narrangements, worked effectively by (i) involving local stakeholders in helping to identify and \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004.

The Project builds on existing initiatives; responds to the needs of stakeholders; and \nensures fairer benefits to poor disadvantaged communities and women. The Project is timely \nand based on sound experience; its design is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic focus under the \nCSP  to  increase:  (i)  agricultural  productivity,  (ii)  agricultural  income  and  employment \nopportunities for rural people, and (iii) commercialization of agriculture. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The Project will reduce poverty in the rural communities of 11 EDR districts through \nequitable  and  sustainable  commercialization  of  agriculture.  The  project  outcome  will  be \nimproved efficiency of production, marketing, and processing of HVCs such as vegetables, \nfruits,  tea,  and  spices,  within  the  project  area.  The  project  area  includes  five  hill  districts \n(Dhankuta, Ilam, Panchtar, Terahathum, and Udayapur), five terai districts (Jhapa, Morang, \nSaptari, Siraha, and Sunsari), and one mountain district (Taplejung). The districts were selected \nbased on favorable agroclimatic patterns, the existing entrepreneurial base, and successful \ncases of commercial agriculture, road connectivity, proximity to Bangladesh and Indian markets \nfor agricultural products, potential for growth of the rural economy and for advancement of \nwomen\u2019s status, and the potential for replication of models to other regions of Nepal. The \nProject will help the EDR to build on these opportunities by strengthening the capacity of \nfarmers to become more involved in commercial agriculture, and the processors and traders to \nimprove their efficiency with linkages to farmers and small entrepreneurs. \n \nB.  Outputs \n21.  The project outputs include (i) increased public and private investment in commercial \nagriculture, (ii) inclusion of poor and semicommercial stakeholders in commercial agriculture, \n(iii) timely availability of market information to farmers, and (iv) enhanced capacity of project \npartners in supporting farmers. The outputs will be delivered through five components. \n \n1.  Commercial Agriculture Investment and Management \n \n22.  The Project will facilitate key agricultural stakeholders (farmers, traders, and processors) \nto work together to increase commercialization in agriculture. This will be done by establishing a \ncommercial agriculture fund (CAF), a cost-sharing grant facility, to (i) develop community-based \nmarket infrastructure investments, and (ii) develop noninfrastructure investments to add value to \nagriculture products. Commercial Agriculture Alliance (CAA), a not-for-profit company, has been \nestablished to manage the CAF, and more importantly to facilitate subproject linkages and the \nnetworking of agricultural stakeholders within the project area. \n \n23.  The CAA will have two categories of membership: (i) general members comprising \nfarmer groups and cooperatives, traders, and processors engaged in commercial agricultural \nactivities  within  the  project  area;  and  (ii)  nominated  members  comprising  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), Ministry of Local Development, district development \n ", "6   \ncommittees (DDCs) of the 11 project districts, and the Agro Enterprise Center9 of the Federation \nof Nepal Chambers of Commerce and Industry. \n \n24.  To encourage more balanced membership composition in the CAA and to encourage \nmore  balanced  CAF  investments  by  CAA  general  members,  CAA  will  utilize  mass  media \n(newspaper,  radio,10  and  television),  trade  fairs,  and  brochures  for  targeted  information \ndissemination by (i) district (to ensure CAA general member representation from all districts); (ii) \nlocations in a district (to ensure CAA general member representation from different locations \nwithin a district); (iii) commodity type (to encourage investment in all potential commodities for \nagribusiness,  not  only  one  or  two);  and  (iv)  stakeholders  (to  ensure  farmer  groups  and \ncooperatives, traders, and processors are all represented in the CAA). \n \n25.  The CAA will have an elected board of directors and a management team headed by a \ngeneral manager assisted primarily by a company secretary, chief accountant, compliance \nofficer, and other necessary support staff. The CAA will have a branch in each of the 11 project \ndistricts, headed by the branch manager assisted by a finance and administration officer, a \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) officer, and other support staff. The target is that women make \nup 20% of CAA management. Appendix 4 provides additional information on the CAA, its \nmanagement structure, and membership criteria. The Project will finance CAA staff salaries, \noperating  expenses,  annual  general  meetings  and  district  meetings,  and  external  auditing \nduring project implementation. \n \n26.  The CAF will finance (i) community-based market infrastructure investments, and (ii) \nnoninfrastructure investments. Only the general members of the CAA and DDCs within the \nproject area will be eligible to receive financing. To receive CAF financing as a grant on a cost-\nsharing basis, the proposed investment must (i) incorporate public good content, (ii) add value \nto agricultural products, (iii) benefit other agricultural stakeholders and the community as a \nwhole, (iv) improve market-chain efficiency, and (v) provide a strong demonstration impact for \nthe community. The CAF will be utilized during project implementation and will lapse on its \ncompletion. The methodology for the processing of CAF applications is provided in Appendix 4. \n \n27.  Community-Based Market Infrastructure Investments. Only the DDCs are eligible to \napply for community-based market infrastructure investments. Farmer communities, through \ntheir village development committee (VDC), will identify needs in a participatory manner, and \nthe DDCs will screen VDC requests before submitting the proposal to the CAA to ensure (i) no \nduplication with other development programs in the district, and (ii) adequate appraisal of the \ntechnical and financial feasibility of the proposal. In this type of investment, the CAF will finance \na maximum of 75% of the investment cost, with the community providing a minimum of 10% of \nthe investment cost in the form of labor and in-kind contributions. The DDC will finance the \nremaining 15% of the investment cost in the form of technical services, field appraisal, and \nassessment. The range of community-based investments will include small collection centers, \nsmall markets, ropeways, small suspension bridges, farm-to-market road improvement including \nculverts and swing bridges, small-scale cool or cold storage, and small-scale marketing-related \nwater supply. The VDCs and farmer communities assisted by the DDC district technical office \nwill be responsible for construction, management, and maintenance of the infrastructure. \n \n                                                 \n9  The Agro Enterprise Center is the technical wing of the federation, which deals with agribusiness development and \npromotion in Nepal. \n10  The radio station in Biratnagar has wide coverage in EDR. \n ", "    7 \n28.  Noninfrastructure  Investments.  The  CAF  will  provide  financial  assistance  for \nnoninfrastructure  investments  of  farmer  groups  and  cooperatives,  traders,  and  processors, \nwhich are the general members of the CAA. For this type of investment, the CAF will finance a \nmaximum  of  50%  of  the  investment,  with  the  remainder  to  be  contributed  by  the  direct \nbeneficiaries. Among others, the investments could include (i) group promotion of improved \ncultivation practices for HVC11 and emerging crops;12 (ii) pest management including integrated \npest management techniques; (iii) farm machinery and equipment; (iv) greenhouse equipment; \n(v) agroprocessing equipment and machinery; (vi) laboratory equipment for product testing and \nquality control; and (vii) market-related research and technology development such as pickle \nmaking, fruit or vegetable drying or preservation, tomato pulp making, crop diversification into \nemergent HVCs, and farm-to-market packaging systems. The selected investments must have \nmaximum demonstration impact on the community and other agriculture stakeholders. All farm-\nlevel investment supports will be provided to farmer groups or cooperatives, not to individuals. \nTraders  and  processors  must  explicitly  demonstrate  how  their  proposed  investments  will \nenhance the agriculture value chain by strengthening linkages between farmer groups and \nmarkets. \n \n29.  Other  noninfrastructure  investments  by  CAA  general  members  include  launching \npromotional  and  representational activities  such  as  (i)  trade  fairs  and  trade  promotion;  (ii) \nindustry  networking  on  issues  requiring  joint  action  for  resolving  cross-border  issues  and \nreducing  local  red  tape;  (iii)  product  labeling  and  certification  arrangements;  (iv)  product \nidentification,  branding,  and  feasibility  studies;  (v)  quality  mark  initiatives;  (vi)  brand  and \nintellectual property right protection; and (vii) specialized skill development and employment \nstrategy formulation. \n \n2.  Inclusive Development of Stakeholders \n \n30.  This component will (i) assist small, marginal farmers within the project area to develop \nor  participate  in  income-generating  agricultural  activities  and  undertake  more  commercial \nactivities; (ii) strengthen stakeholders (farmers, traders, processors) already partly engaged in \ncommercial agriculture to become fully commercial and eligible for CAA membership; and (iii) \npromote  social  inclusiveness  and  environmental  responsibility  among  commercial  CAA \nmembers. This component will also develop marketable skills of the poor and landless, who \nmay then be employed by CAA members. This component is closely linked with component 1 \n(commercial agriculture investment and management) as the CAF investments will address and \nreinforce social inclusion and assist subsistence stakeholders to raise their commercial status. \nThis  will  be  accomplished  by  developing  community-based  market  infrastructure,  providing \ncatalytic investments that will benefit subsistence stakeholders, and implementing the whole \nrange of CAA activities that promote backward and forward linkages. \n \na.  Development of Subsistence Agricultural Stakeholders  \n \n31.  The  Project  will  support  subsistence  stakeholders13  to  take  a  more  active  role  in \ncommercial  agriculture  activities  They  will  be  supported  through  interventions  on  (i)  group \n                                                 \n11  Including cabbage, cardamom, carrots, cauliflower, ginger, herbs, honey, mushrooms, tea, and tomato; and fruits \nsuch as citrus, mango, lychee, papaya, and pineapple. \n12  Examples include onion, garlic, gherkin, herbs, and essential oils. \n13  The stakeholders consist of (i) farmers with small areas of land who produce only for their own family needs and \nhave no meaningful surplus for sale, and (ii) the landless who participate in agriculture-related activities. \n ", "8   \nformation;14 (ii) identification of existing and potential HVC production areas and marketing \npoints; (iii) vocational and technical training on producing identified off-season vegetable and \nHVCs;  (iv)  capacity  building  in  market  awareness  (quality  and  supply  requirements,  price \nbargaining); and (v) networking of farmer groups with other agricultural stakeholders including \ninput (seed, fertilizer, machinery) suppliers, traders, processors, and public and private service \nproviders including DOA, research institutions, and rural financial institutions. In forming farmer \ngroups, the Project will promote mixed or women-only groups to enhance the participation of \nwomen. An associated Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant will provide the needed seed \ncapital, materials, and equipment to the subsistence stakeholders.15 \n \n32.  The  landless  will  be  provided  with  skill-based  training  in  areas  such  as  transport \n(construction, repairs or ownership of rickshaws, bicycles, or oxcarts), packaging (weaving of \nbaskets for transport), production (on-farm labor), primary processing (product washing and \ndrying), tool making, and servicing (repair of small equipment). They will also benefit from \nemployment opportunities generated from investments made under component 1. \n \n33.  These activities will be delivered by NGOs that are well established in the project area, \naccepted by the communities, and have a track record of assisting socially excluded people. \nThe Project will enter into partnership arrangements with the selected NGOs. Depending upon \nthe existing skill mix of partner NGOs and types of support needed, the Project may engage \nmore than one partner NGO in the same district but in separate locations or on different tasks. \nThe  use  of  local  NGOs  will  contribute  to  sustainability,  decentralization,  and  local \nacceptance/ownership  of  activities  supported  by  the  Project.  Appendix  5  discusses  the \nprinciples, procedures, and criteria for NGO partnership. \n \nb.  Enhancement of Semi-Commercial Agricultural Stakeholders \n \n34.  For stakeholders involved in more than subsistence agriculture but not commercialized \nenough to be CAA members, the Project will help them move to higher commercial status and \ndevelop their eligibility for CAA membership. The specific activities will be to help (i) form farmer \ngroups  into  community  umbrella  groups,  associations,  or  cooperatives  with  a  market \ndevelopment focus; (ii) strengthen existing semicommercial agricultural stakeholder groups in \naccounting,  bookkeeping,  and  group  management;  (iii)  build  market-chain  awareness  and \nlinkages; (iv) improve quality assurance systems (hygiene, handling, packaging, transport); (v) \nupgrade  primary  processing  technology,  e.g.,  grading,  processing,  packaging,  and  quality \nassurance for specific products; and (vi) train on entrepreneurship development and business \nplanning, and price and contract negotiations. Strengthened farmers groups and cooperatives \nwill be assisted to apply for CAA membership. NGOs will be engaged to deliver these activities \nusing the same arrangement as under subcomponent 2.a. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14  Activities include awareness campaigns on social equity issues, proposed project interventions, group formation \nand group management skills training, and identification of development opportunities. \n15  The  proposed  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  grant,  Improving  the  Livelihoods  of  Poor  Farmers  and \nDisadvantaged Groups in the Eastern Development Region of Nepal, is targeted toward equal participation of \nsocially and economically excluded groups and vulnerable people such as marginal farmers, the landless, dalits \n(untouchable castes) and ethnic minorities. The grant will provide seed funding and seed packages to subsistence \nstakeholders in all 11 project districts to enable them to participate in meetings; group activity processes; capacity \nbuilding; and purchase of small items, equipment, or materials to help them enter into commercial activities. \n ", "    9 \nc.  Promotion of Social Inclusiveness among Commercial Agricultural \nStakeholders \n \n35.  The Project will provide commercial agricultural stakeholders with awareness training on \n(i) social issues, such as economic opportunities for inclusion of the poor and disadvantaged; (ii) \ngender  issues;  and  (iii)  environmental  issues  and  responsibility.  This  training  will  support \nincentives provided to CAA members to engage in socially inclusive behavior, since to obtain \nfinancial assistance under the CAF, their applications must contain a clear description of how \ntheir investment will (i) add value to the product, (ii) add value to market linkages to the farmer, \n(iii) provide opportunities of employment for landless and others, and (iv) benefit the process of \ncommercialization as a whole. The training will be provided by selected service providers such \nas the Agro Enterprise Center and chambers of commerce. Appendix 6 discusses the selection \nprocess and eligibility criteria for service providers. \n \n3.  Market Information Dissemination \n \n36.  The availability of critical timely information to farmers minimizes their risks, maximizes \nopportunities, and enables them to move on a more equal footing. This component will establish \nan integrated market information system with multiple users to address the current imbalance in \nmarket information sharing and enhance transparency within the agriculture value chain. \n \n37.  The Project will assist farmer groups through partner NGOs and district agriculture \ndevelopment  offices  to  systemize  and  replicate  group  or  cooperative-based  information \nsystems, throughout the project area. Activities include (i) development, installation, and training \nin market information sharing system for farmer marketing groups; (ii) networking these systems \nto other market information systems; and (iii) collecting and disseminating information on the \ndemand, price, and expected delivery time disaggregated by product type and grade at various \naccessible markets in Nepal and neighboring countries, particularly in Bangladesh and India. \nData to be collected on local, regional, and international markets will include information on \ncontract  production  systems,  specialization,  value-adding  activities,  crop  varieties  and \nproduction systems, and processing technologies. The Project will support the dissemination of \nmarket information, and notification of market trends and events through mass media. \n \n4.  Project Partners Capacity Enhancement \n \n38.  This component will build the capacity of project partners including DDCs, NGOs, DOA \ndistrict staff, and CAA district branch staff to address the specific needs of each project partner \nin order to be able to contribute significantly to the Project\u2019s impact.16 The specific activities \nunder  this  component  that  will  be  applicable  to  all  the  project  partners  are  (i)  project \nstandardization training to provide a complete understanding of the Project, its components and \nactivities,  and  importantly  its  cross-cutting  values  regarding  equity,  gender,  partnership, \nparticipation, and environmental sustainability; and (ii) basic marketing development training on \npostharvest, marketing, market-chain improvement, product handling, and agribusiness. \n \n39.  Partner  NGOs  will  be  strengthened  in  social  mobilization,  group  formation  and \norganizational growth, beneficiary monitoring and public auditing, office administration, and \naccounting.  DOA  staff  will  receive  more  advanced  training  on  products  and  product \ndevelopment,  market-chain  development  and  innovation,  primary  processing  methods, \n                                                 \n16  Experience in Nepal indicates that unless the capacity of all stakeholders within the project framework is developed \nconcurrently, development activities will be unbalanced and placed at risk by the least capable partners. \n ", "10   \norganizational  development  (companies,  cooperatives,  networking  associations,  and \nfederations), entrepreneurship and NGO orientation, market information systems, and price \nanalysis. The goal is for DOA staff to be market oriented with stronger capacity to support \nfarmers and NGOs, and to be able to liaise more effectively with processors and traders. CAA \ndistrict branch staff will specifically be strengthened in investment analysis, project appraisal, \nand management of meetings to help them meet their responsibilities for CAA activities and \nreview of proposals for CAF funding. \n \n5.  Project Implementation Support \n \n40.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  and  activities  will  be  managed  by  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) and the CAA. The PMU will have planning, procurement, accounting, \nand M&E capacity, with M&E staff assigned special duties relating to governance and social \ninclusion. Consulting services, physical facilities, and transport will be provided to the PMU and \nCAA to support project supervision, management, and capacity building. The Project will install \nnotice  boards  to provide  information  on  services  available  and  the procedure, timing,  and \ncontact person for obtaining the services. The Project will also establish a website to (i) provide \nproject implementation information including information related to component 1; and (ii) track \nprocurement  contract  awards,  including  amount,  and  basic  information  on  the  processes \nadopted, and list of goods or services purchased and their utilization. \n \n41.  Assisted by the consultants, the PMU will carry out (i) a baseline survey on beneficiary \nsituations, (ii) product and market-chain analysis at the start of the Project, and (iii) annual \nsocioeconomic studies that focus on evaluating the project benefits and impacts on poverty \nreduction.  All  project  staff  and  consultants  will  be  required  to  undertake  the  project \nstandardization  training  provided  to  project  partners,  and  to  include  an  assessment  of \nachievement of the values on equity, partnership, participation, and gender in their regular \nproject reporting. \n \nC.  Special Features \n42.  Marketing and Processing. A significant feature of this Project is that it focuses on \nagriculture  marketing  and  processing,  and  on  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  value  chain \nbetween farmers and consumers. This makes the Project significantly different from previous \nagriculture projects, which focused on production and extension services. \n \n43.  Market-Chain  Linkages.  The  Project  has  a  two  dimensional  thrust:  (i)  to  develop \nfarmers\u2019 capability so that they are more effective and influential in reaching up the market \nchain, and (ii) to work with private sector processors and traders to improve their efficiency and \nto develop linkages to farmers. Development of these linkages and increased transparency of \nactivities within the market chain are key features of the Project. \n \n44.  Demand-  and  Stakeholder-Driven.  As  compared  to  most  past  approaches  to \nagriculture  development  in  Nepal,  the  project  activities,  including  CAF  investments,  social \ninclusiveness initiatives, market information dissemination, and capacity enhancement of project \npartners, will be largely shaped in response to demands, capacities, and constraints of the \nproject beneficiaries, and market opportunities for commercial agriculture development. \n \n45.  Socially Inclusive Participation. The Project contains a package of activities aimed at \nthe poor and disadvantaged to move them out of poverty and allow them to participate in \ncommercial agriculture. Strengthening effective and equitable linkages between stakeholders in \nthe market chain to increase farmer returns and improve the efficiency of marketing is largely a \nnew area of activity. The Project provides assistance for those wanting to become more equal \n ", "    11 \nand effective partners in marketing their products. The focus is on HVCs, which potentially offer \nhigh returns to farmers and significant employment generation relevant for the landless poor \nwho  engage  in  agricultural  wage  labor.  Cross-cutting  values  on  equity  (equal  sharing  in \nparticipation and benefits), gender equality, participatory practices and processes, fairness in \ndealings between stakeholders, and public-private partnerships are built into the project design, \nand will affect consultant selection, staff selection, and all aspects of project implementation. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n46.  The project investment cost is estimated at $24.1 million, including taxes and duties of \n$0.3 million. Summary estimates by component are in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n \n47.  The Government has requested a grant of $18.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Project. The grant will finance 74.7% of the project cost.17 \nThe Government is to provide $0.8 million equivalent in the form of project staff salary, project \noffice overhead and operational cost, and taxes and duties, or 3.2% of the total project cost. \nCAA general members will finance 16.6% of the project cost equivalent to $4.0 million in the \nform of counterpart funding to the interventions financed under the CAF. The DDCs will finance \n3.3%  of  the  project  cost  or  $0.8  million  equivalent  in the  form  of  technical  services,  field \nappraisal, and assessment. Farmer communities will finance 2.2% of the project cost equivalent \nto $0.5 million in the form of labor and in-kind contributions. \n \n48.  Table 2 summarizes the financing plan. Nepal is eligible for Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) grants up to 50% of the total ADF allocation. The Project falls within the guiding principles \nof the ADF IX Grants Program: (i) Nepal is among the poorest countries in the region; (ii) \nvulnerabilities due to debt stress and the past conflict constrain development possibilities and \npoverty  reduction  efforts;  (iii)  the  Project  will  support  close  collaboration  between  the \nGovernment and civil society; (iv) the Project will contribute to poverty reduction and restoring \n                                                 \n17  ADB\u2019s cost share at 74.7% is in accordance with the country cost-sharing ceiling applicable to Nepal (i.e., 80%). \n ", "12   \npeace and stability; and (v) ADF grant financing will be complementary to activities of other \nagencies. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank           18.0    74.7 \nGovernment of Nepal  0.8    3.2 \nCommercial Agriculture Alliance General Members  4.0    16.6 \nDistrict Development Committees  0.8    3.3 \nFarmers Communities  0.5    2.2 \n  Total  24.1    100.0 \n             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n49.  The MOAC will be the Executing Agency. The CAA will be the Implementing Agency for \nthe component on commercial agriculture investment and management (component 1), and \nDOA will be the Implementing Agency for the other components. Both MOAC and DOA have \nimplemented a number of multilateral development bank projects and have the organizational \nstructure, managerial skills, and financial management system to implement the Project. \n \n50.  To  ensure  efficient  implementation  and  management  of  the  project  activities,  the \nGovernment will establish a PMU in Biratnagar to be headed by a project manager. The PMU \nwill (i) prepare annual work plans and project progress reports; (ii) recruit consultants and award \nprocurement contracts; (iii) supervise project activities other than for component 1 and the \nperformance of partner NGOs and service providers; and (iv) carry out M&E of the activities, \noutputs, and expected impacts other than for component 1. The project manager will be jointly \nselected by MOAC and ADB from competent and experienced Government officers. The project \nmanager should have core competences in leadership, management, and coordination, with \nexpertise and experience in commercial agriculture. \n \n51.  The PMU staff will include a social equity officer with a cross-cutting role to ensure social \nconflict identification and resolution processes. The officer will ensure that fairness is applied to \nall  dealings  with  partners  (NGOs  and  service  providers)  and  beneficiaries  (financial  and \nmanagement related). The PMU will also appoint a results-based monitoring officer, who will be \nresponsible for ensuring a balance between monitoring the quantifiable (inputs and outputs) and \nnonquantifiable  project  impacts.  Other  PMU  officers  include  planning  and  implementation \nofficers, accounts and financial officers, procurement and contract officer, and technical officers. \nOne of these officers will be responsible for managing a complaint cell to be created as part of \nthe  complaint  redressal  mechanism  under  the  Project.  The  full  listing  of  PMU  staff  is  in \nAppendix 8. \n \n52.  The management structure of the CAA is described in para. 25 and Appendix 4. \n \n53.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  (i)  oversee  project \nimplementation, (ii) review project progress, and (iii) resolve policy issues related to the Project. \nThe  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  MOAC  secretary,  with  the  project  manager  as  member \nsecretary, and include the director general of DOA; joint secretaries of MOAC and the ministries \nof finance (foreign aid); industries, commerce and supplies; local development (devolution); \nwomen, children and social welfare (planning); and National Planning Commission (agriculture \n ", "    13 \nand forestry); executive director of the Agro Enterprise Center; and general manager of the \nCAA. The PSC will convene its meeting at least twice a year. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n54.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Initial \nactivities will include (i) establishing the PSC, (ii) fully staffing the PMU and CAA headquarters \nand district branches, (iii) establishing the project result monitoring framework, (iv) establishing \ncomplaint redressal mechanisms, (v) recruiting consultants, (vi) engaging partner NGOs, (vii) \norienting  partner  NGOs  and  other  stakeholders,  (viii)  procuring  essential  equipment  and \nvehicles,  and  (ix)  conducting  the  baseline  survey  and  product  and  market-chain  analysis. \nScreening, evaluation, and approval of CAF investment proposals will start from the fourth \nquarter of 2007, and the full implementation of CAF subprojects will begin by the first quarter of \n2008 after ensuring that the investments are demand driven, technically feasible, and comply \nwith investment criteria. The market information system will be established from the last quarter \nof 2007. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n55.  The PMU  will be responsible for procurement of all goods and services under the \nProject, following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). Supply contracts for equipment or \nmaterials estimated to cost $500,000 or more will be awarded through international competitive \nbidding, and those costing less than $500,000 (other than minor items) will be awarded through \nlimited international bidding. Shopping procedures will be applied for small or off-the-shelf items \nvalued at less than $100,000. Procurement by CAF recipients, including civil works, will follow \nthe financial intermediaries\u2019 method. An indicative procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n56.  The Project will require 818 person-months of consulting services, including 36 person-\nmonths of international and 782 person-months of national expertise.18 The consulting services \nwill mainly cover market-chain development, social inclusion and participation, agribusiness \ndevelopment,  commercial  agriculture  fund  analysis  and  advisory,  community  subproject \ninvestment, market information and promotion, training design, M&E, and environmental impact \nanalysis and monitoring. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The quality- and cost-based selection process will \nbe applied. The Government will undertake advance action for recruiting consultants to facilitate \nthe Project\u2019s start-up. The Government has been advised that approval of advance action does \nnot commit ADB to finance the Project. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 11. \n \n57.  Because of the innovative project design and the demand-driven and socially sensitive \nproject approach, selection of the international project adviser (team leader) and the national \ndeputy team leader is considered critical to project success. These two consultants will be \nrecruited  as  individual  consultants.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  recruit  the  individual \nconsultants under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual \nconsultants. The recruitment will be carried out immediately after project effectiveness so they \ncan assist with project start-up activities. The least cost selection method will be used to recruit \nconsultants or service providers for (i) training and workshops; and (ii) surveys, monitoring and \n                                                 \n18  The bulk of domestic consulting services will be utilized to employ three full-time social inclusion specialists and \nthree full-time agribusiness development specialists who will be fielded in the districts. \n ", "14   \nevaluation. Other consultants will be recruited through a firm by the Government, with the \nagreement of ADB. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n58.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy19 was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nMOAC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the grant regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of MOAC and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. Other special features of the Project to ensure accountability and \ngood governance are described in paras. 66\u201368. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n59.  To ensure effective project implementation and timely disbursement, immediately after \ngrant effectiveness the Government will establish two project imprest accounts for the PMU and \nCAA respectively. The accounts will be established in the Nepal Rastra Bank. The accounts will \nbe managed and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and \ndetailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The initial cumulative deposit into \nthe imprest accounts will not exceed the estimated ADB-financed expenditures for the next 6 \nmonths,  or  10%  of  the  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure will be used for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating the imprest account \nfor any individual payment transaction up to $50,000 equivalent. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n60.  All  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  will  prepare  and  maintain  separate \naccounts for project-related disbursements. The PMU will consolidate the accounts and submit \nthem to the Ministry of Finance and ADB. The audit of imprest accounts and statements of \nexpenditure can be carried out as part of the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion on the \npart of the examination relating to imprest accounts and statement of expenditure should be \nseparately  set  out  in  the  auditor\u2019s  report.  Project  accounts,  together  with  disbursement \ndocuments, will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, and will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The \nGovernment will ensure submission of audited project accounts within this stipulated time frame. \n \n61.  An annual performance audit of CAA will be conducted by an independent and external \nauditor, having at least 5 years of working experience as a qualified accountant, to (i) review all \nCAA disbursements to the intended recipients of the CAF, (ii) evaluate the extent to which \nproper and timely disbursements were made, and (iii) recommend measures to improve the \ntimely and effective disbursement of the CAF. The CAA will be required to fully implement the \nrecommended measures within 1 month of its receipt of the report. \n \n62.  The  PMU  will  provide  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  project \nimplementation, and such other reports and information reporting to the Project as ADB may \nreasonably request. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMU will submit \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n ", "    15 \na project completion report to the PSC and ADB. The project manager will be responsible for \npreparing these reports, accounts, and statements; and ensuring that they are submitted in \naccordance with the agreed time frame. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n63.  The Project will be monitored and evaluated to determine its efficiency (delivery of inputs \nagainst specified implementation targets and time frame) and effectiveness (outputs, outcomes, \nand short-term impacts) as measured against baseline and product-chain data. The baseline \nand  product-chain  studies  will  be  undertaken  in  each  district  and  involve  quantitative  and \nqualitative assessments to provide a clear understanding of the beneficiaries\u2019 socioeconomic \ncharacteristics, including ethnicity, gender, and economic status; and an assessment of the \nvalue chain that will serve as a benchmark against which project progress can be measured. \n \n64.  The Project will solicit monitoring and evaluation feedback on project activities from (i) \nfarmer groups; (ii) marketing groups, associations, and cooperatives; (iii) partnering NGOs and \ntraining service providers; (iv) the CAA and its branch offices; (v) project studies and reports; (vi) \nproject-supported market information system; and (vii) any other relevant sources such as the \nFederation of Nepal Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The collected information will be \nanalyzed,  evaluated,  and  aggregated  to  be  utilized  for  (i)  guiding  project  planning  and \nimplementation decision making, (ii) inclusion in the Project\u2019s reporting framework, and (iii) \nutilization by institutional partners such as DOA and the Federation of Nepal Chambers of \nCommerce and Industry. \n \n9.  Project Review \n65.  ADB and the Government will review the Project at least twice a year; this includes the \nperformance of the PMU, CAA, and partner NGOs and service providers; physical progress of \nproject  implementation;  inclusion  of  the  poor,  excluded  groups,  and  women  in  project \nimplementation; and compliance with grant covenants. ADB and the Government will also \nundertake a comprehensive midterm review of the Project at the beginning of the fourth year to \nidentify problems and constraints encountered and suggest measures to address identified \nconstraints. Technical, budgetary, and design modifications could be considered based on the \nresults of the review.  \n \n10.  Measures to Enhance Governance and Prevent Corruption \n66.  The  Project  will  incorporate  certain  measures  to  enhance  governance  and  prevent \ncorruption. The measures for project-wide activities include the following: \n \n(i)  A compliance officer in the CAA will undertake all necessary measures to prevent \nand  address  any  financial  irregularities  and/or  abuse  of  authority  in  CAA \noperations, including in CAF management. The compliance officer will liaise with \nthe  relevant  government  agencies  or  commissions  responsible  for  efforts  to \ncombat corruption and abuse of authority. \n(ii)  A  complaint  redressal  mechanism  will  ensure  that  complaints  made  by  the \nintended project beneficiaries are addressed accordingly. The mechanism must \nbe established, to the satisfaction of ADB, within 4 months of grant effectiveness. \n(iii)  Consultants  will  support  PMU  staff,  particularly  on  consultant  recruitment, \nprocurement, training and financial management, and preparation of a project \nadministration memorandum to guide implementation. \n(iv)  Information technology will be required to increase transparency, accountability, \nand efficiency in the procurement process. \n \n ", "16   \n \n67.  Measures specific to CAA management of the CAF are as follows: \n \n(i)  The CAA board will establish an appraisal panel to ensure that the selection of \nthe interventions to be financed under the CAF is done in accordance with the \nagreed standard operating procedures and selection criteria. \n(ii)  The CAA general manager, CAA appraisal panel members, and CAA compliance \nofficer will be required to disclose their wealth prior to and upon completion of \ntheir assignments. The disclosure must be made in a manner that will allow the \npublic to access this information. \n(iii)  A performance audit of the CAF and CAA will be conducted annually to review all \ndisbursements made by the CAA within a particular year to the intended CAF \nrecipients, and evaluate the extent to which proper and timely disbursements \nwere made. This audit will be conducted by an independent and external auditor. \n(iv)  The CAA will establish standard operating procedures and a code of conduct, \nwhich will incorporate conflict of interest rules applicable to its board members, \nmanagement, and staff. The conflict of interest rules will be designed to ensure \nthat the CAA will operate in a transparent and equitable manner. \n(v)  Entities closely affiliated with appraisal panel members will be prohibited from \nsubmitting any proposals for financing under the CAF.20 \n(vi)  The maximum amount of financing that each general member can obtain from \nthe CAF on cumulative basis will be $40,000; the maximum amount for each \nDDC on cumulative basis will be $320,000.  \n \n68.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  implement  the  following  to  ensure  its  activities  are  as \ntransparent as possible: \n \n(i)  The Project will disseminate information regarding its objectives, programs, and \nfunding arrangements to the targeted beneficiaries to ensure optimal awareness \nand understanding of the Project.  \n(ii)  The complaint redressal mechanism to be established under the Project will \nensure that the community is able to submit complaints and track measures \nundertaken to address them.  \n(iii)  The  Project  will  involve  beneficiaries  in  monitoring  project  implementation. \nRepresentatives  of  farmer  groups  assisted  under  the  Project  will  meet  in \nworkshop situations on a regular basis to report to the PMU on the delivery of \nproject inputs, effectiveness of project interventions, and performance of partner \nNGOs.  \n(iv)  The process of application and the approved investments under the CAF will be \nmade transparent to provide the community with access to such information. \nApplicants whose applications are declined will be informed individually by the \nCAA with reasons for such decision.  \n(v)  Within 3 months of submission to ADB, annual project progress reports shall be \nmade  available  to  the  public,  in  particular  the  local  stakeholders,  in  Nepali \nlanguage. \n \n                                                 \n20  Close affiliation means an entity in which the appraisal panel member or any of his/her immediate family members \nhas 50% or more financial interest. \n ", "    17 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n69.  Details of the project justification and economic analysis are in Appendix 12. The Project \nwill reduce rural poverty in the EDR through equitable and sustainable commercialization of \nagriculture. Impacts include increased economic activities and jobs in the project area. Social \ninclusion  activities  will  promote  the  participation  of  all  stakeholders  including  the  poor, \ndisadvantaged, and women in commercial agriculture; and help them receive fair benefits from \nsuch participation; and in turn contribute to restoring peace and stability in the EDR. The Project \nwill directly generate employment opportunities to subsistence stakeholders by promoting HVC \nproduction  and  marketing,  transporting  products  from  the  field  to  storage  and  processing \ncenters, and assisting small-scale community-based market infrastructure development. The \nlandless poor will, through skill-based training, be made more employable and capable of \nincome generation. The Project will also assist fully commercial stakeholders to add value to \nagriculture  products,  while  at  the  same  time  encouraging  them  to  adopt  socially  inclusive \nbehavior that helps the less advantaged. The private sector as a key partner will, through its \ninvestment, directly generate job opportunities for the poor and enhance the value of agriculture \nproducts. A review of representative subprojects shows that typical investments to be made in \ncommercial agriculture activities will be economically viable and financially sustainable. \n \nB.  Social Measures and Impact on Poverty \n \n70.  Appendix 13 presents the summary poverty reduction and social strategy. The Project\u2019s \nobjectives and incentives to promote cross-cutting values of equity, partnership, participation, \ngender, and transparency in commercial agriculture development will be openly expressed and \nguide project implementation. These values will become the standard by which implementation \nactivities are assessed, and during implementation will begin to change behavior and attitudes \nof the stakeholders. This is expected to result in reduced vulnerability, poverty, inequity, and \nsocial conflict.  \n \n71.  Social  inclusion  initiatives  of  the  Project  directly  support  subsistence  farmers  and \nlandless poor with information, skills, technology, group organizing, and business opportunities \nthat  will  allow  them  to  pursue  microenterprises,  self-employment,  or  other  opportunities  in \ncommercial agriculture. Positive impacts on social and gender development will occur by (i) \nexpanding opportunities for the poor and women to engage in commercial activities, (ii) reducing \nany vulnerability of disadvantaged groups arising from commercializing agriculture, and (iii) \nenhancing capabilities to engage directly in or benefit indirectly from commercial agriculture. \n \n72.  Poverty reduction impacts of the Project are expected to arise through four channels: (i) \nemployment generation, (ii) organization of smallholder farmers into larger groups to better \naccess market and processing opportunities, (iii) additional income opportunities in a more \ndynamic rural economy, and (iv) development of the capacity of farmers to negotiate more \neffectively with other stakeholders in the marketing chain. Investments through the CAA will \nexpand production and marketing of a broad range of high-value agricultural products\u2014resulting \nin outlets for smallholder farmers\u2019 production, employment of labor both on-farm and off-farm, \nand increased marketing efficiency for commercial stakeholders. \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects \n \n73.  Environmental analysis of the Project indicates that some minor adverse impacts may be \ngenerated.  These  impacts  may  arise  from  intensified  use  of  land  and  water  resources, \nincreased use of agrochemicals (fertilizers and pesticides), and upgrading of small-scale rural \n ", "18   \ninfrastructure. An initial environmental examination suggests that possible negative impacts will \nbe small, localized, and readily mitigated. For example, rural road improvements will be limited \nto upgrading and rehabilitating existing roads. Minor irrigation will be limited to introducing \ninnovative technology such as sprinkler systems and drip irrigation. Proposals for CAF financing \nwill require environmental impact assessments. Environmental and social impact specialists will \nbe engaged to ensure that the environmental and social concerns of ADB and the Government \nare incorporated into work planning and monitoring of the Project. \n \nD.  Sustainability \n \n74.  Project  sustainability  depends  on  sustainability  of  project  investments.  All  the \nsubprojects will be demand led; financial sustainability is the most important selection criterion. \n \n75.  For project assistance with market infrastructure, farmers will, with the assistance of their \nVDC and DDC, prepare the own proposals for assistance, and be involved in implementation \nand  subsequent  management  of  the  activity.  Ownership  and  the  sustainability  of  the \ninvestments  will  be  high.  To  reinforce  this,  each  application  will  contain  subplans  for \nmanagement,  maintenance,  and  capacity  development;  and  a  description  of  how  forward \nlinkages with traders, processors, and marketers will be developed. \n \n76.  Assistance to processors and traders is aimed at adding value to agriculture products \nand developing linkages with farmers. A large element of public good is a requirement for the \napproval  of  any  such  assistance.  The  technologies  developed  and  linkages  established, \nwhether in the form of contract production, employment generation, or entrepreneurial activity, \nare expected to be durable and lasting. The CAA, if effective as a forum for market-chain \nstakeholders, will continue to service stakeholder needs on a self-financing basis beyond project \nimplementation.21 Successful operation of the CAA will provide an approach that can be utilized \nby MOAC and other development partners. \n \n77.  The Project will launch socially inclusive commercial agriculture activities in the EDR; the \neffects are expected to spill over to other regions as well. The Project\u2019s social inclusiveness and \nfarmer group approach is based on well-founded principles and methodologies. Incorporated \ninto the process of strengthening farmer groups is the concept of economic and organizational \ngrowth.  Strengthened  leadership,  subproject  investment,  and  training  in  marketing  and \nagribusiness to produce a focus on production and market linkages will facilitate farmer groups \nmoving from single production to a broader marketing focus, and from groups to cooperatives. \nDevelopment of linkages with other market-chain stakeholders and investment in storage and \nprimary  processing  ventures  by  the  groups  is  expected  to  continue  beyond  project \nimplementation. \n \n78.  The enhanced capacity of project partners will support sustainability of project outputs. \nThe development of DOA staff capacity will have future benefits arising from the inclusion of \nsocial development and marketing activities in DOA\u2019s annual program. Local NGOs, being \nresident within the project area, and having their management, social development, and market-\noriented capabilities strengthened under the Project, will become a significant ongoing district \ndevelopment  resource.  They  are  most  likely  to  continue  similar  social  development  and \nmarketing activities with farmers and other marketing stakeholders beyond the Project. \n \n                                                 \n21  A similar district participatory mechanism established under the ADB-assisted Third Livestock Development \nProject\u2014the livestock action team\u2014continues to function effectively beyond project completion. \n ", "    19 \nE.  Risks \n \n79.  The current ceasefire and ongoing talks between the Government, political parties, and \ninsurgents is very encouraging for Nepal\u2019s future. Any breakdown of these and resumption of \nhostility would present a risk for project implementation. The project-specific conflict impact \nassessment (Supplementary Appendix A) finds that projects focusing on quick impact activities, \nimplemented by local agencies, with flexible design and full transparency are able to operate in \nconflict-affected  areas.  The  recommendations  of  this  assessment  are  incorporated  in  the \nProject\u2019s design. \n \n80.  The capacity of institutions and individuals to adapt to the new approach of the Project is \nidentified as a risk. The proposed demand-driven and socially inclusive approach demands \nchange in the way service providers operate and behave. This is true for both public service \nproviders and NGOs. Attitudinal change takes time and to facilitate this change the Project \nsupports capacity development at all levels and among all stakeholders through immersion \ntraining and ongoing dialogue mechanisms. Awareness building and capacity development will \nbe interlinked and ongoing. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n81.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Within 2 months of grant effectiveness, the board of directors of CAA will have \nadopted (a) a business plan, (b) standard operating procedures that incorporate \nthe  principles  of  equitable  participation  of  women  and  include  provisions  to \nprohibit any discriminatory or prejudicial measures against the minority and/or \ndisadvantaged groups, and (c) code of conduct that incorporates the conflict of \ninterest rules, acceptable to ADB, to be applicable to staff and members of the \nboard of directors. Each of the business plan, standard operating procedures, \nand code of conduct will be formulated to the satisfaction of ADB. \n(ii)  Within 3 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will ensure that the PMU \nis fully staffed with adequate representation of women staff. \n(iii)  Within  4  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  a \ncomplaint  redressal  mechanism  for  the  beneficiaries  under  the  Project  is \nestablished, to the satisfaction of ADB. \n(iv)  Within 4 months of grant effectiveness, the CAA headquarters staff will be fully \nstaffed to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n(v)  Within 4 months of grant effectiveness, the CAA will have established a district \nbranch at each of the project districts and appointed a branch manager to head \neach of the district branches.

Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n82.  Prior to grant effectiveness, the following conditions need to be met: \n \n(i)  The Government will have established the PSC. \n(ii)  The Government will have appointed the project manager. \n(iii)  The CAA general manager and company secretary will have been appointed. \n \n \nVI.

Project Area \n1.  The Eastern Development Region (EDR) comprises 16 districts: 5 in the terai (lowlands) \n(Jhapa, Morang, Saptari, Siraha, and Sunsari), 8 in the hills (Bhojpur, Dhankuta, Ilam, Khotang, \nOkhaldhunga, Panchtar, Terahathum, and Udayapur), and 3 in the mountains (Sankhuwasabha, \nSolukhumbu,  and  Taplejung).  The  five  districts  of  Bhojpur,  Khotang,  Okhaldhunga, \nSankhuwasabha,  and  Solukhumbu  are  the  most  isolated  and  have  much  less  potential  for \nagricultural commercialization than the remaining 11. Therefore the project area includes the 5 \ndistricts in the terai, and 6 districts in the hill and mountain areas (Dhankuta, Ilam, Panchtar, \nTaplejung, Terhathum, and Udayapur). \n \nB.  Land Use \n2.  The total cultivated area in 2000-01 was 872,123 hectares (ha), of which 70% was in the \nterai. Cereal production occupies 83% of the cultivated area. Cash crops rank second occupying \n7.7% of the area and including potato and sugarcane. The remaining 9% is distributed among \npulses (4.4%), vegetables (3.9%), and fruit (1%). The distribution of crop categories is relatively \nsimilar in the terai, hill, and mountain districts. \n \nC.  Value of Crop Production  \n3.  Cereals, covering about 83% of the cultivated area, have a gross production value of only \n60% of the total. Vegetables, on the other hand, take about 4% of total cultivated land, but \ncontribute 13% to total value of production. Some of the highest value crops produced in the region \n(cardamom and tea) contribute about 8% to total gross value, but occupy less than 0.2% of the \ntotal cultivated area. The total value of production is estimated at NRs24,604 million in 2001-02; \nwith the terai districts having the largest share: Jhapa with 24%, Morang 18%, and Saptari 13%. \nThe largest share in the hill districts is Ilam with 6%. In most of the terai districts, paddy share is \nmore  than  60%  of  the  total  district  value  added;  the  only  exception  is  Jhapa,  where  more \ndiversified agriculture includes tea and other products. \n \nD.  Comparative and Competitive Advantage of EDR Agriculture \n4.  Calculations for nominal protection coefficients and domestic resource costs show that the \nEDR has a comparative advantage in the production of a wide range of agricultural commodities \nincluding fruits, vegetables, and cereals. However the comparative advantage in production is \neroded by an underdeveloped marketing system. This is reflected in high transaction costs related \nto marketing, transportation, storage, taxes, grading, and packing. These transaction costs imply \nthat domestic prices are much higher than costs of production and are also higher than border \nprices  with  India.  The  competitiveness  of  Nepalese  products  is  then  largely  lost  between \nproduction  and  consumption.  This  indicates  a  need  to  improve  the  organization  of  the \npostproduction system, and increase the efficiency of value chains. \n \nE.  Crop Production Trends \n5.  Four main conclusions are drawn from an analysis of crop production trends in the EDR: \n \n(i)  During the past 5 years, the project districts indicated a preference for high-value \ncrops (HVCs). In terms of production growth, potato, sugarcane, vegetables, citrus, \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nand tea were major performers, with average growth rates ranging from 4.5% for \nvegetables to 16.5% for sugarcane.  \n \n(ii)  Some farmers have diversified away from wheat and pulses. The area under HVC \ncultivation is growing faster than that for cereals. Since the HVC share in total \ncultivated area is small (13%), the process of diversification is still at its beginning.  \n \n(iii)  Yields are still low, but are increasing in the case of paddy, potato, and vegetables. \nProductivity increases in maize, sugarcane, fruits, and spices appear stagnant.  \n \n(iv)  Success lies in vegetables, tea, and potatoes. In the case of tea and potatoes, some \ninvestment in storage and processing has started, and the value chains for these \ntwo commodities have strengthened. The private sector is taking the lead, while the \npublic sector extension and research system lags. \n \nF.  Cost of Production, Income, and Crop Potential \n6.  Farmers consider many different factors other than yield when deciding which crops to \ncultivate, including what technology (i.e., inputs and crop management) to apply, where and when \nto sell the produce, and the expected income and cost of production. The decision to embark on \nHVC production is complicated by the presence of risk related to new technology (e.g., hybrid \nseeds and drip irrigation), pests and disease, price variability, and timely access to market. An \nanalysis  of  HVC  cost  of  production  and  income  indicates  (i)  commercial  agriculture  shows \nconsiderable gains in yields and income, (ii) the most productive farmers in the region are often \nsmallholder farmers cultivating small areas of land\u2014cultivated areas for HVCs are generally much \nsmaller than for cereals, and (iii) cost of production and income for HVCs are much higher than for \ncereals. \n \nG.  Constraints to HVC Production \n7.  The area devoted to HVCs is much smaller than that for cereals for a variety of reasons. \nFirst, crops can be cultivated only under certain favorable climatic, soil, and water conditions. In the \nEDR, these conditions vary considerably from district to district and within each district. Large land \nareas  suitable  for  commercial  cultivation  of  HVCs  are  sometimes  not  available.  Second, \nsmallholders may not be familiar with crop management; the use of inputs; and the integrated \nplant, pest, and water management required for effective HVC cultivation. Third, poor access to \nmarkets for HVCs is one of the main reasons for the reluctance of farmers to increase cultivated \nareas. In the case of perishables, such as vegetables and potatoes, the absence of easily available \nstorage and market outlets means that increased production could result in increased losses. \nFourth, the cash requirements of the higher cost of HVC production represent a considerable \nchallenge for smallholders. Without access to credit, many of these farmers cannot buy the inputs \nrequired to carry out HVC production or make the initial investment for cultivation of perennials \n(fruit trees, tea, cardamom, etc). Fifth, unless farmers perceive that HVC is a relatively safe \nstrategy  to  ensure  food  security  for  their  households,  they  are  unlikely  to  embark  on  HVC \nproduction on a large scale. Finally, because of lack of storability of many HVCs (e.g., vegetables, \nfruits), more difficult management of pests and plant diseases, smaller markets, and greater price \nvariability of HVCs, the risk involved in HVCs is higher than for cereals. The price variability of \npotatoes is 3.6 times the price variability of rice; and for cabbage the variability is 6.1. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nH.  HVC Preferences by Socioeconomic Groups \n8.  The majority of socioeconomic groups in the terai and hills prefer growing vegetables and \npotatoes  (Table  A2).  Spices  and  tea  are  typical  of  the  hills,  whereas  aromatic  rice,  mango, \nsugarcane, and fish (aquaculture) are typical in the terai. When asked to prioritize, vegetable \nproduction is identified as the top priority enterprise for which commercial principles should be \nstrengthened and developed.  \n \nTable A2: Preferences for Major High-Value Crops \nGroups  Hills and Mountains   Terai \nWell off  Cardamom, ginger, off-season  Mango, fish, off-season vegetables, \nvegetables, broom grass, and tea  potatoes, lentil, aromatic rice \nMedium  Cardamom, ginger, off-season  Off-season vegetables, potatoes, \nvegetables, broom grass  tomatoes, lentils, aromatic rice \nPoor/  Off-season vegetables, potatoes,  Green vegetables, leafy vegetables, \nVulnerable  ginger, cardamom, red chili leafy  chili, sugarcane \nvegetables \nWomen  Off-season vegetables, leafy  Vegetable, tomato, chilies, tobacco, \nvegetables, tomatoes, chilies  lentils \ncardamom, ginger, turmeric \nSource: ADB. 2003.  Commercial Agriculture Development Project Report (Social Survey). Manila. \n \nI.  Analysis of Commercialization of Agriculture in the EDR \n1.  Strengths \n9.  Diverse  Agroclimate  Environment.  The  terai  and  hill  districts  can  grow  a  variety  of \ntropical, subtropical, and temperate crops. Off-season vegetables reap high prices both in Nepal \nand in neighboring Bangladesh and India. Spices and tea have great potential that has been only \nmodestly exploited.  \n \n10.  Labor  Force.  Indicators  such  as  mean  years  of  schooling,  literacy  rate,  educational \nattainment index, and gender development index present a situation for the EDR better than the \naverage for Nepal. For example, the mean years of schooling are 2.7 years in the EDR and 2.3 in \nNepal; the gender development index is 0.30 in the EDR and 0.27 in Nepal. \n \n11.  Entrepreneurial  Base  for  Commercial  Agriculture.  Several  agroprocessing  and \nagribusiness  units  are  based  in  the  EDR,  particularly  in  the  Morang-Sunsari  area,  including \nsugarcane processing, fruit and vegetable processing, jute milling, cold storage, and vegetable \nghee processing; in addition to rice mills, dhal factories, beer and liquor factories, tanning and \nleather processing, and paper industries. The situation in the hills is less developed as a result of \npoor  infrastructure  and  limited  access  to  electricity.  However,  even  in  the  hills  several \nagroentrepreneurial skills have been developed in recent years, particularly in vegetable and fruit \nproduction and marketing, spices, and tea (orthodox). \n \n12.  Farm and Women Organizations. Farmer groups engaged in commercial agriculture were \nvisited in most of the 11 districts of the project area; the most dynamic are in 7 districts, namely the \n5 terai districts and the hill districts of Dhankuta and Ilam. Cooperatives like the Koshi Multipurpose \nCooperative in Dhankuta export to India; the Betel Nut Producer Association in Jhapa is active in \nexports and in promoting the interest of its members; and the Chamber of Industry in Morang \nincludes some of the main agro-industrialists in the region.  \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n13.  Road Corridors. A main road runs along the east\u2013west axis in the terai, and two main \nroads run along the two south\u2013north corridors leading to Dhankuta and Ilam. The relation between \nroad infrastructure and development of commercial agriculture is strikingly close with the most \ndynamic farmer groups and commercial agro-enterprises to be found along the road corridors.  \n \n2.  Weaknesses \n14.  Weak Research and Extension Services. The weakness of the research and extension \nsystem to provide effective services to commercial agriculture stakeholders is particularly acute for \nHVCs and the postproduction functions including marketing and processing. Commercial farmers \nand agroenterprises indicate little linkage with research and extension organizations; moreover, \ncommercial stakeholders do not seem to receive research or extension services that respond to \ntheir needs. Most of the research and extension efforts are supply pushed by public research \ninstitutes, district agriculture development offices, NGOs, and universities. Research and extension \nare not demand-driven. \n \n15.  Poor Connections to Main Roads. Although the region has some relatively acceptable \nmain road connections, the secondary connections to the main roads are few and often in dismal \ncondition. When roads are constructed, the input of communities is not adequately considered. As \na result, road construction is expensive and quality is low. Maintenance of roads that are not \nowned by communities is virtually absent. \n \n16.  No Clear Strategies to Promote Commercialization. Commercial stakeholders in the \nEDR  are  not  advised  about  strategies  currently  in  place  to  promote  commercialization.  The \nstrategy of the Agriculture Perspective Plan is basically supply-driven comprising a package of \npriority inputs (roads, irrigation, fertilizer, and technology). The underlying assumption is that the \nprovision of these inputs will result in higher agricultural growth. However, higher growth may be \nachieved with different strategies and different combinations of inputs than those rigidly specified in \nthe plan. For example, some of the most dynamic changes in commercial agriculture of the EDR, \nnamely those related to orthodox tea, sugarcane, potatoes, and hybrid vegetables have occurred \nlargely because of the initiative of commercial stakeholders and not because of the Agriculture \nPerspective Plan.  \n \n17.  Limited Access to Markets for Quality Inputs. Farmers experience difficulty in accessing \nhigh-quality seed and planting material, especially disease-free potato seed and disease-free fruit \nseedlings. In the case of fertilizer, a widely held perception is that quality has deteriorated. Farmers \nrightly demand higher quality. However, often farmers working at a low level of commercialization \nare not ready to pay the higher costs associated with higher quality. More commercialized farmers \nrecognize that higher quality inputs cost more.   \n \n18.  Limited Access to Credit and Finance. Too much emphasis is placed on interest rates to \nexplain limited credit availability. Even at high interest rates, smallholder farmers need credit. The \npresence  of  poorly  understood  and  sometimes  complex  procedures  to  access  credit,  lack  of \nknowledge  of  proper  procedures,  and  absence  of  adequate  collateral  prevents  commercial \nstakeholders from getting additional credit. Competition among banks and financial institutions \nensures that market forces determine interest rates. However, the risk associated with lack of \ncollateral presents a problem aggravated by the perception that commercial and HVC production \nand prices are highly variable. \n \n19.  Weak Coordination among Agricultural Institutions. In spite of a number of coordination \ncommittees  (such  as  the  Regional  Agriculture  Development  Coordination  Committee,  district \nagriculture  development  coordination  committees,  and  regional  technical  working  groups  on \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nagriculture), little effective coordination occurs for line agencies involved in agriculture and also \nwithin the same sector (e.g., between research, extension, farmers, traders, and processors or \ncrop commodities).  \n \n20.  Poorly Developed Postproduction System. Several examples of the rudimentary status \nof postproduction technology in the EDR include (i) lack of cool and other appropriate storage, and \npoor quality facilities at farms or collection centers for perishable fruits and vegetables result in low \nprices at harvest time; (ii) weaknesses in packaging and transport of perishable produce lead to \nhigh losses and in some cases to unattractive presentation of the produce in markets; (iii) technical \nknowledge of commercial refrigerated cold storage, apart from storing potatoes, is inadequate; and \n(iv) marketing and branding capabilities in export markets are limited, even in sectors such as \northodox  (highland)  tea  where  Nepalese  processed  products  are  of  international  competitive \nquality. \n \n3.  Opportunities \n21.  Comparative Advantage in Variety of Crops. The hills have a comparative advantage in \noff-season vegetables, seed production, citrus, and spices. However, the terai can also achieve \nconsiderable success in the commercialization of a variety of crops, including vegetables and \ntropical fruits, oilseed, tea (cut, tear, and curl), betel nuts, and cereals. To a large extent many of \nthe crops produced in the region can be developed to a commercial level if effective value chains \nare organized.  \n \n22.  Proximity to Large Markets for Agricultural Products. The EDR's eastern and southern \nborders  with  India  and  the  proximity  to  Bangladesh  provide  an  important  opportunity  for \ncommercial agriculture. Traditionally, many agricultural innovations have come from India to Nepal \nvia the EDR. Currently, major markets in India, including Calcutta, New Delhi, and Siliguri are \noutlets for Nepalese agricultural products.  \n \n23.  Agricultural and Rural Economic Growth with Poverty Reduction Effects. Growth of \ncommercial agriculture in the EDR will induce growth of rural employment and increased linkages \nbetween agriculture and other sectors in the rural economy. Commercial agriculture development \nis expected to benefit the poor directly through employment creation in the farm subsector and \nindirectly through the creation of opportunities in the nonfarm subsector. \n \n24.  Advancement of Women\u2019s Status. Women make up a major share of the labor force in \nagriculture  (45%  in  the  EDR)  and  represent  a  considerable  share  of  the  labor  force  in  the \npostproduction sector. Commercialization of agriculture is expected to increase women\u2019s income \nand stimulate women\u2019s entrepreneurship in activities traditionally controlled by men. \n \n25.  Replication  of  Success.  Even  though  the  EDR  is  relatively  more  favorable  for \ncommercialization than other regions, successful commercialization in the EDR might stimulate \nreplication in other regions. Strong similarities between regions include the topographic gradient \nfrom south to north; proximity to India; social stratification along the dimensions of caste, ethnicity, \nand gender; weak linkages between stakeholders; and limited access to technology, finance, and \nmarkets. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT \n(1995\u20132006) \n \n

Commercial Agriculture Alliance  \n1.  The Project will establish a commercial agriculture alliance (CAA) as a not-for-profit \ncompany under the Company Ordinance and a commercial agriculture fund (CAF). Both are \nmechanisms to improve the effectiveness of project delivery and to demonstrate approaches to \naccelerate  commercialization.  The  CAA  is  intended  to  provide  a  forum  for  stakeholder \ninteraction and a means to access grant funding for investments that will strengthen the process \nof commercialization of agriculture. The CAA will manage the CAF, which will only be accessible \nto CAA members.  \n \n2.  The head office of the CAA will be located at Biratnagar. The CAA will have an elected \nboard  and  a  management  team  headed  by  a  general  manager  assisted  by  a  company \nsecretary, compliance officer, chief accountant, and other support staff.1 CAA headquarters staff \nwill  have  adequate  representation  of  women,  who  will  make  up  at  least  25%  of  CAA \nmanagement. The CAA will have a branch in each of the 11 districts. \n \n1.  Membership \n3.  The  CAA  will  have  two  membership  categories:  general  members  and  nominated \nmembers.

The panel will comprise (i) two board members; (ii) the \ngeneral manager; and (iii) two technical experts, who will be selected by the board from a list \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \nprepared by the general manager. The chair of the panel will be selected from among its \nmembers. The tenure of board members and the technical experts will be for a period not to \nexceed 2 years. \n  \n11.  Good Governance. To enhance good governance in CAA operations, the CAA board of \ndirectors will adopt (i) standard operating procedures that incorporate principles of equitable \nparticipation  of  women  and  include  provisions  to  prohibit  any  discriminatory  or  prejudicial \nmeasures against minorities and/or disadvantaged groups; and (ii) a code of conduct that \nincorporates conflict of interest rules for staff and members of the board of directors acceptable \nto ADB. Other measures include the requirement for the CAA general manager, appraisal panel \nmembers, and compliance officer to disclose their wealth prior to and upon completion of their \nassignments. The disclosure must be made in a manner that allows public access to this \ninformation. An annual performance audit will review all CAA disbursements within a particular \nyear to the intended recipients of the CAF, and evaluate the extent to which proper and timely \ndisbursements were made. \n \n3.  District Operation of the CAA \n12.  Role of the CAA District Branch. The district branch will: \n \n(i)  receive and process membership registrations, and submit a recommendation \nletter to CAA headquarters for formal membership registration;  \n(ii)  undertake initial review and selection of CAF proposals; and \n(iii)  undertake other responsibilities assigned by the CAA general manager. \n \n13.  Branch Manager. The CAA general manager will select a CAA branch manager for \neach district branch, using a competitive and transparent process. The branch manager will be \nassisted by a finance and administration officer, monitoring and evaluation officer, and other \nsupport staff.2 The CAA district staff will have adequate representation of women. The branch \nmanager, who will report to the general manager, will have a 2-year tenure, renewable on \nsatisfactory performance.  \n \n14.  District Review Committee.

The tenure of the technical \nexpert and the CAA general member representatives will be for a period not to exceed 2 years. \nThe district review committee may seek technical advice from external parties to facilitate initial \nscreening of CAF applications. \n                                                 \n2  The other staff in the district branch include an office assistant, computer operator, and service person. \n ", "  Appendix 4  35 \nB.  Commercial Agriculture Fund \n16.  The CAF is a cost-sharing grant facility managed by the CAA. Funds are available to \nCAA  general  members  and  the  DDCs  to  strengthen  market-chain  activities  and  develop \nlinkages within the market chain.  \n \n17.  Investments. CAF financing will be allocated equally to (i) community-based market \ninfrastructure investments; and (ii) noninfrastructure investments. A maximum of $80,000 will be \nprovided  for  each  community-based  market  infrastructure  intervention  and  a  maximum  of \n$20,000 for each noninfrastructure investment. The allocation of the CAF to specific districts will \nvary according to need. Each general member can obtain a maximum of $40,000 on cumulative \nbasis, and each DDC a maximum of $320,000 on cumulative basis. \n \n18.  General Criteria. Proposals for interventions for CAF financing must meet the following \ncriteria: \n \n(i)  add value to agricultural products,  \n(ii)   benefit other agricultural stakeholders and the community as a whole,  \n(iii)   improve market-chain efficiency,  \n(iv)   incorporate public good content, and \n(v)  have strong demonstration effects on the rest of the community. \n \n19.  Applications  must  be  demand  driven  and  identified  by  stakeholders  themselves. \nContracted service providers, e.g., nongovernment organizations, will provide assistance with \nproposal preparation to the less advantaged. Additional assistance may include technology and \nskills  training,  capacity  building  (of  groups)  technical  assistance,  and  equipment.  Entities \naffiliated with members of the appraisal panel will not be allowed to submit proposals for CAF \nfinancing.  \n \n20.  Cost-Sharing. For community-based market infrastructure, the CAF will finance 75% of \nthe investment cost. The community will provide 10% of the investment cost in the form of labor \nand in-kind contributions, and the DDC will finance the remaining cost in the form of technical \nservices,  field  appraisal,  and  assessment.  For  noninfrastructure  investments,  the  CAF  will \nfinance  a  maximum  of  50%  of  the  investment  cost;  the  direct  beneficiaries  will  cover  the \nremaining cost. \n \n21.  Initial Review and Selection of CAF Proposals. CAA members will apply for CAF \nassistance through the CAA district branch.3 The branch manager will forward proposals to the \ndistrict review committee for their evaluation on whether the proposals meet the predetermined \ncriteria.  Proposals  meeting  the  criteria  will  be  submitted  to  the  appraisal  panel  at  CAA \nheadquarters for final review and approval. \n \n22.  Village development committees and community groups will prepare the proposals for \ncommunity-based market infrastructure. The proposals will be submitted to the DDC, which will \n                                                 \n3  An exception is when proposals apply to more than one district. This will occur when a whole marketing chain is \nbeing addressed as in the case of a quality assurance or transport improvement proposal. In this case, the CAA \nheadquarters can receive the proposal but refer it to the respective district branches for comment before final \nappraisal and approval. \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \nundertake initial screening to ensure (i) no duplication with other development programs in the \ndistrict, and (ii) adequate appraisal of the technical and basic financial feasibility of the proposal. \n \n23.  Indicative  List.  Community-based  market  infrastructure  investment  proposals  may \ninclude (i) small collection centers, (ii) small markets (haat bazaar), (iii) ropeways/suspension \nbridges, (iv) farm-to-market road improvement including culverts and swing bridges, (v) small-\nscale cold/cool storage, and (vi) storage facilities. Priority will be given to civil works that link \nfarmers more effectively to the market chain. \n \n24.  Noninfrastructure investment may take the form of (i) group promotion of improved \ncultivation practices for HVC4 and emerging crops;5  (ii) pest management including integrated \npest management techniques; (iii) farm machinery and equipment; (iv) greenhouse equipment; \n(v) agroprocessing equipment and machinery; (vi) laboratory equipment for product testing and \nquality control; and (vii) market-related research and technology development such as pickle \nmaking, fruit or vegetable drying or preservation, tomato pulp making, crop diversification into \nemergent HVCs, and farm-to-market packaging systems. The selected investments must have \nmaximum demonstration impact on the community and other agriculture stakeholders. All farm-\nlevel investment supports will be provided to farmer groups or cooperatives, not to individuals. \nTraders  and  processors  must  explicitly  demonstrate  how  their  proposed  investments  will \nenhance the agriculture value chain by strengthening linkages between farmer groups and \nmarkets. \n \n25.  Other  noninfrastructure  investments  by  CAA  general  members  include  launching \npromotional  and  representational activities  such  as  (i)  trade  fairs  and  trade  promotion;  (ii) \nindustry  networking  on  issues  requiring  joint  action  for  resolving  cross-border  issues  and \nreducing  local  red  tape;  (iii)  product  labeling  and  certification  arrangements;  (iv)  product \nidentification,  branding,  and  feasibility  studies;  (v)  quality  mark  initiatives;  (vi)  brand  and \nintellectual property right protection; and (vii) specialized skill development and employment \nstrategy formulation. \n \n26.  Fund Utilization. The fund will be utilized during project implementation and will lapse \non project completion. \n \n                                                 \n4  Including cabbage, cardamom, carrots, cauliflower, ginger, herbs, honey, mushrooms, tea, and tomato; and fruits \nsuch as citrus, mango, lychee, papaya, and pineapple. \n5  Examples include onion, garlic, gherkin, herbs, and essential oils. \n ", "  Appendix 5  37 \nPARTNERSHIPS WITH NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  The Project will enter into partnership arrangements with nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  to  assist  subsistence  and  semi-commercial  stakeholders\u2014farmers,  traders,  and \nprocessors\u2014who are not eligible for commercial agriculture alliance (CAA) membership but \nhave potential to develop such eligibility if they receive support to overcome their difficulties. \nThese  stakeholders  are  generally  engaged  in  subsistence  activities  or  some  small-scale \ncommercial undertakings. With support from the partner NGOs, stakeholders who are producing \nonly enough for subsistence are expected to be able to generate additional income and take up \ncommercial  activities,  while  those  already  engaged  in  commercial  activities  beyond  their \nsubsistence  needs  will  be  able  to  increase  their  turnover  and  become  eligible  for  CAA \nmembership.  \n \n2.  The  project  inputs  that  the  partner  NGOs  will  deliver  to  such  stakeholders  include \ncommunity mobilization, social inclusion activities, farmer group formation and strengthening, \nand monitoring and evaluation. The types of services to be provided by the NGOs will be \nspecified in the partnership agreement reflecting the needs of the target groups, capacity of the \npartner NGO, and commercial agricultural focus of the Project. \n \n3.  The partner NGOs are preferably based in the Eastern Development Region (EDR) and \nregistered in one of the districts in the project area. They should preferably have experience \nworking in more than one district. Any exception to this must be justified and documented. \n \n4.  The project management unit (PMU) will enter directly into partnership agreements with \nseveral NGOs. The actual number will depend on the capacity of the NGO and ability of PMU \nstaff to provide effective and meaningful time inputs to support the partner NGOs. Depending \nupon the existing skill mix of partner NGOs and type of support needed in the district, the PMU \nmay engage more than one partner NGO in the same district but in separate locations or on \ndifferent tasks. This will increase collaboration and mutual learning together with a feeling of \ncompetitiveness for quality between partner NGOs. \n \n5.  The partner NGOs will engage local NGOs that are working closely with the communities \nin the project area for particular services and functions. The partner NGOs will provide training \nand coaching to their  local counterparts as required to enhance performance quality. The \napplication  submitted  by  the  NGO  for  partnership  with  the  PMU  will  give  the  names  and \ndescription of the counterpart local NGOs they work with and the selection criteria they applied. \nThe capacity-building activities of local NGOs will contribute to sustainability, decentralization, \nand local acceptance/ownership of activities supported by the Project. \n \n6.  As agricultural marketing is a new area of activity, capacity building of partner NGOs and \nthrough them of local NGOs is required to enable them to effectively fulfill their roles. When local \nNGOs are strengthened they will be able to provide ongoing services to the disadvantaged, \npoor, and women; and produce lasting improvements in their living conditions. Efforts will be \nmade to develop decentralized NGO-based support services.  \n \n7.  To make services to these stakeholders relevant and effective, different services will be \nrequired at different stages during the development life-cycle of local organizations and groups. \nThe PMU will regularly assess and plan jointly with the partner NGOs and farmer organization \nleaders for more advanced capacity development. Proposed services will also take into account \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \nthe target beneficiary\u2019s opportunities and constraints (season, time, duration, frequency, and \ntime gaps). \n \n8.  The basic philosophy of the relationship between the Project and partner NGOs will be \none of partnership,1 where both parties have equal status and responsibilities.  \n \nB.  Procedure for Partnership Agreements \n \n9.  The rational for the Project to engage partner NGOs that are well established in the \nregion is to ensure that they are accepted by the communities and have substantial knowledge \nof local circumstances. These potential project partners may lack capacity in some areas and \nthe Project will address these through training, advisory, and support services. A transparent \nand self-screening approach that is sensitive to local issues in the current conflict context is \nproposed.  \n \n10.  The  Project  will  initiate  a  series  of  steps  for  selecting  NGOs  for  partnership \narrangements.  \n \n(i)  The PMU will provide an orientation for NGOs from the EDR to present and \ndiscuss the project concept and program, potential partnership opportunities, \ncriteria for NGO partnership selection, and project expectation of NGOs. \n(ii)  The PMU will place advertisements in local newspapers and informal networks of \ndistrict development committee, line agencies, and NGOs calling for applications \nfrom interested NGOs.

The  social \ninclusion  component  will  promote  the  participation  of  all  stakeholders  including  the  poor, \ndisadvantaged, and women in commercial agriculture; and help them receive fair benefits from \nsuch participation. In this way, the Project will greatly contribute to restoring peace and stability \nin Nepal. The Project will directly generate employment opportunities to poor and marginal \nfarmers and landless people by promoting high-value crop (HVC) production and marketing, \ntransporting agriculture products from the field to storage and processing centers, and assisting \nsmall-scale community-based market infrastructure development. The Project will also help fully \ncommercial stakeholders to become more efficient and successful, at the same time ensuring \nthey adopt socially inclusive behavior and activities that help the less advantaged. Investments \nby the private sector, a crucial partner for commercial agriculture development, will directly \ngenerate  job  opportunities  for  poor  farmers  and  enhance  the  value  addition  of  agriculture \nproducts. \n \nA.  Project Justification and Beneficiaries \n \n2.  The growth of the rural economy is essential to poverty reduction and national economic \ngrowth. Most of the poor in the country live in rural areas and derive their livelihoods from \nagriculture. Acceleration of agricultural growth will not be possible if strategies continue to focus \nmainly on production. For the agriculture sector to grow and generate large benefits for the rural \neconomy and the poor, agriculture must be reoriented to commercial production, processing, \nand marketing. The growth of commercial agricultural activities will increase employment and \nincome in rural areas; stimulate farm and nonfarm activities such as agroprocessing, marketing, \nand  business  services;  establish  value-chain  linkages  among  farmers,  traders,  and \nagroprocessors; and generate value addition of products. \n \n3.  The  main  project  beneficiaries  will  be  farmers  (including  subsistence  and  women \nfarmers) growing or interested in growing HVCs such as vegetables, fruits, and spices; and \nentrepreneurs located in the identified high potential areas of the Eastern Development Region \n(EDR). Since women constitute the majority of the agricultural labor force, the Project identifies \nmeans to facilitate their full participation and ensure commensurate benefits to them. The EDR \nwas identified because of its agroclimatic suitability for HVC production, and the availability of \nirrigation and road infrastructure created by previous government and external investments. The \nproject  design  incorporates  lessons  from  past  projects  and  builds  synergy  with  past  and \nupcoming investments in the sector indicated in the Tenth Five-Year Plan. \n \n4.  The Project\u2019s target groups are subsistence, semi-commercial, and commercial farmers, \nprocessors, and traders. Subsistence stakeholders include landless, smallholder farmers and \nsmall processors and traders, who produce only enough for their subsistence and have no \nmeaningful surplus for sale. Semi-commercial stakeholders are farmers, traders, processors, \nand  retailers  whose  marketable  output  is  periodic,  seasonal,  or  uncertain.  Commercial \nstakeholders  comprise  groups,  alliances,  cooperatives,  and  companies  who  as  their  main \noccupation produce, process, and engage in trade for the purpose of selling agriculture products \non  a  regular  basis.  The  subsistence  and  semi-commercial  stakeholders  will  benefit  from \nsubprojects relating to marketing infrastructure such as farm-to-market roads, river crossings, \ncollection and storage facilities, and market-related technology training for which up to 75% of \nthe cost will be financed by the commercial agriculture fund (CAF). Commercial stakeholders \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \nwill  benefit  from  subprojects  to  strengthen  and  shorten  supply-chain  linkages;  disseminate \nproduct storage, processing, and packaging technology; and provide support to address policy \nand regulatory constraints. The CAF will finance up to 50% of the cost of subprojects proposed \nby  commercial  stakeholders.  Subprojects  initiated  by  commercial  stakeholders  should  also \nbenefit subsistence and semi-commercial farmers, traders, processors, and retailers. Thus, \nsubsistence and semi-commercial stakeholders will be the major beneficiaries of the CAF. \n \nB.  Indicative Subproject Analysis \n \n1.  Approach and Methodology \n \n5.  The  Project  is  designed  to  stimulate  commercial  activities  in  the  agriculture  sector \nranging from preproduction support through commercial production to postproduction handling, \nprocessing, transport, storage, and marketing. All the investments will be demand driven and \nidentified during implementation. As a result, the likely mix of the scale and type of interventions \nand the overall project benefits cannot be accurately ascertained. Thus, undertaking a full-scale \nbenefit-cost  analysis  is  not  practical.  Instead,  representative  subprojects  that  could  be \nimplemented by the Project were analyzed. \n \n6.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects,1  the \nrepresentative subproject analysis is based on the investment budget model with a breakdown \nof revenue and cost by investment outputs and inputs, and projected cash inflows and outflows \nover 15 years, priced at constant 2006 prices. Sensitivity analyses of the risk of a shorter \neconomic life expectancy were conducted. All revenues, benefits, and costs are incremental, \nand expressed in 2006 prices in Nepalese rupees. An average mid-2006 official exchange rate \nof NRs73.74 per $1.00 is applied to convert foreign exchange costs to their local currency \nequivalent. The analytical framework includes the following: \n(i)  All prices, benefits, and costs are adjusted to 2006 constant values using (a) a \ngross domestic product deflator for all local currency benefits and costs, and (b) \nthe G-5 manufacturer\u2019s unit value index for all foreign exchange.  \n(ii)  A discount rate of 12 % is used to calculate the net present value and as a cut-off \npoint for the economic internal rate of return. \n(iii)  The project benefits and costs in financial prices are adjusted to economic prices \nby deducting taxes and duties, and by applying item-specific conversion factors \nto nontraded local currency costs. \n(iv)  Specific conversion factors for various project inputs and outputs are based on \nestimated shares of foreign exchange and labor. Some key conversion factors \ninclude 0.66 for vehicles, 0.70 for local manufactures and extracted materials, 0.7 \nfor  community-based  infrastructure  maintenance,  and  0.93  as  the  standard \nconversion factors. \n(v)  A shadow rural wage rate of 0.87 is estimated and applied to unskilled labor to \nreflect un- and underemployment in the project area. \n \n2.  Results of the Economic Analysis \n \n7.  The  incremental  benefit  analysis  approach  is  applied  to  demonstrate  potential \nimprovements in the performance of major participants within the agriculture value chain, by \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

Developing community-based market infrastructure will enable the Project to address \none of the major constraints in marketing\u2014linking farmers to markets. Following the awareness-\nbuilding activities of the Project, farmer communities will identify subprojects. Subprojects will be \napproved when the farmer communities can demonstrate (i) community need, (ii) that the \ninvestment can be managed and maintained by the community, (iii) that the investment will add \nvalue to marketing activities, (iv) that benefits will apply equitably to the community or group and \nnot to individuals, and (v) that the upstream and downstream value-chain linkages have positive \nbenefits for others, e.g., unemployed. \n \n9.  The establishment of small collection centers is expected to generate employment and \nrevenue in rural areas. Benefits will also accrue to farmers and traders, as they are expected to \nrealize (i) significant savings in time and cost in the transport and marketing of agricultural \nproducts; and (ii) reduction in losses in product quality due to establishment of these centers at \nstrategic locations that are easily accessible to producers and buyers. Upgrading farm-to-market \nroads  will  encourage  development  of  idle  lands  for  agricultural  production,  resulting  in \nincremental production/revenues for farmers and increased agricultural products traded locally \nby  intermediaries.  Investments  in  technology  enhancement  subprojects  (i.e.,  postharvest \npackaging,  storage  facilities,  feed  production,  and  extension)  are  expected  to  result  in  (i) \nreduction in costs due to postharvest losses among farmers and traders; (ii) lower production \ncosts for feed processors, subsequently lower feed price for farmers; and (iii) incremental farm \nproduction. Investments in marketing subprojects are envisaged to benefit both farmers and \ntraders. Better market information will allow them to sell products at competitive prices and in \nmarkets where they may be able to effectively compete. Capacity development of farmers and \nprocessors is expected to improve productivity.  \n \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \n10.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  test  the  significance  of  the  benefit  and  cost \nassumptions.  The  representative  market  infrastructure  subprojects  remain  robust  to  impact \nchanges caused by (i) capital cost increased by 20%, (ii) operation and maintenance cost \nincreased by 20%, (iii) benefits reduced by 20%, and (iv) combination of the three adverse \neffects. Most technology and marketing related subprojects are also found to be robust with \nimpact changes caused by (i) demonstration cost increased by 20%, (ii) training cost increased \nby 20%, and (iii) revenue decreased by 20%. The tests indicate that viability is more sensitive to \na reduction in benefits than to an increase in costs. \n \nC.  Capacity Strengthening for Appraising Subprojects \n \n11.  Careful  review  and  appraisal  of  subproject  proposals  are  important.  Appendix  4 \ndiscusses in detail the criteria for subproject review procedures and selection. A district review \ncommittee with representation of an outside technical expert will undertake the initial review and \nselection of the CAF proposals submitted by CAA members within the district. The district \nreview committee may also seek technical advice from external parties to facilitate the initial \nscreening of CAF applications. \n \n12.  Additional provisions under component 4 of the Project will enhance CAA staff capacity \nto appraise subprojects. CAA district branch staff and district review committee members will \nspecifically be strengthened on investment analysis, project appraisal, and management of \nmeetings to help them meet their responsibilities for CAA activities and review proposals for \nCAF funding. To ensure efficient implementation of the subprojects, a monitoring and evaluation \nofficer will be fielded at each CAA district branch. \n \nD.  Overall Project Impacts \n \n13.  The cumulative impact of the Project on the economy as a whole will be significant \nthrough direct increases in production, increases in value added, and employment generation. \nIncreased demand for agricultural produce for processing and urban sales will result in higher \nfarmer prices; greater quantities of produce marketed; and a multiplier effect generated through \ngreater demands for on-farm labor, transport, storage, and handling. Disadvantaged segments \nof the community will benefit from the increased demand for labor and farm produce. \n \n14.  Income.  A  multiplier  effect  on  the  incomes  of  beneficiaries  in  the  project  area  is \nexpected. Direct positive income effects will accrue to rural households undertaking commercial \nagriculture activities. Indirect benefits will affect suppliers of input goods and services. A large \nbenefit in income generation will flow to a wide range of farmers who may be suppliers of \nagroprocessing businesses or directly participate as commercial farmers. \n \n15.  Employment. The rural labor force will benefit directly through increased employment \nopportunities. Employment effects are expected to be significant, particularly for women. The \nProject will assist marginal farmers and the landless to organize into groups; strengthen their \ncapacity for improved production of HVCs, off-season vegetables, and fruits with high demand; \nand to graduate to commercial farming. The Project will follow up on the needs and demands for \nsemiskilled and skilled labor in the agricultural value chain and make market-oriented training \naccessible to agricultural wage laborers in search for better employment opportunities.  \n \n16.  Marketing Competitiveness. Increased production of higher value goods and services \nwill increase the volume and value of market transactions. The adoption of various postharvest \ntechnologies (including improved storage, packaging, and processing techniques) will reduce \n ", "  Appendix 12  53 \npostharvest losses, increase quality, provide price stability, and increase competitiveness of the \nproducers.  \n \n17.  Poverty Reduction. Reducing the incidence of poverty in the countryside, where it is \nmost prevalent, will occur as a result of increases in income brought about by growth in the \nvolume  and  value  of  goods  produced  and  marketed,  and  the  employment  opportunities \ngenerated. It will occur to an even greater extent as a result of employment creation in an \nexpanded rural farm and nonfarm sectors. Through its social inclusion activities, the Project \nconcentrates  its  support  on  socially  and  economically  excluded  groups,  such  as  marginal \nfarmers, the landless, dalit (untouchable castes), and ethnic minority population; and ensures \nthat the benefits and opportunities emerging from commercialization of agriculture will be shared \nequitably with them. Furthermore, poverty reduction impacts will extend beyond the simple \nprovision  of  a  daily  wage.  Full-time  employment  will  provide  the  possibility  of  sustained \neconomic and social betterment. With regular incomes the beneficiaries will be in a position to \nbetter provide skills and education for their children, helping their families move out of poverty.  \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nNepal is an agrarian society with agriculture contributing 40% of the gross domestic product. About 88% of the \npopulation live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture is the main source of food and \nincome. In the eastern terai, where the holding sizes are the highest at 0.915 hectares (ha) in average, development \nthrough agriculture is a promising option. Land use intensification, crop diversification, and increased yield are \nmechanisms to improve both land and labor productivity. Commercial agriculture is one of the development alternatives \nthat presents potential opportunities for economic growth and might reduce vulnerability and poverty. The Agriculture \nPerspective  Plan  considers  agricultural  production  and  the  growth  anticipated  in  employment  opportunities  in \nagriculture and related sectors, such as agrobased industries, as the key to poverty reduction. The plan stresses the \nneed to diversify and commercialize agricultural production.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  contribution  to  poverty  reduction  is  expected  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  social  mobilization  and \norganization of subsistence farmers; landless; and vulnerable such as dalit (untouchable castes), low caste, ethnic \ngroups, and women; (ii) income generation through high-value crop (HVC) production; off-season vegetables; and \nassociated income activities such as packaging, small processing, and marketing of produce; and (iii) additional \nemployment opportunities in a more dynamic rural economy. The Project will address the vulnerability factors of \ndisadvantaged people and enhance the capability of the poor to engage directly in (or benefit indirectly from) \ncommercial agriculture. The Project fosters group formation and will help groups to move to commercial farming, thus \nmaking them eligible to become members of the commercial agricultural alliance (CAA) and avail of the commercial \nagricultural fund (CAF). The CAA and CAF will enable all stakeholders to have better access to technology, markets, \ninfrastructure, information, and expansion of production and marketing of a broad range of agricultural products.  \n \nGroup mobilization will motivate subsistence farmers and disadvantaged groups to overcome barriers to organize into \nlarger units, and thus to better cope with risk; and improve access to technology, markets, credit, and information. \nGroup formation is a strategy to cope with small land size and land fragmentation, and to achieve critical mass for \ncommercialization. In terms of poverty reduction, the socially inclusive participation component will provide positive \nimpacts for the poor and vulnerable groups (55% according to surveys conducted during project preparation). \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nBased on the 2001 census, the total population in the 11 project districts is 4,486,482 (848,107 households), \ncomprising 76 recorded ethnic groups in the terai cluster and 31 groups in the hill/mountain cluster. Ethnic diversity \nneeds to be considered when targeting development interventions aimed at livelihood improvement. \n \nAn evaluation of the Ninth Plan (1997\u20132002) and the poverty situation clearly demonstrate that past development \nefforts have fallen behind the expectations of poverty reduction. The main reasons identified were low and unsustained \nbroad-based economic growth, inadequate human development, poor accountability, economic malpractices, and poor \nimplementation and monitoring of development programs. \n \nIn the proposed project area, the reported main root causes of poverty are lack of land (28.9%), high dependency \nrate/illness/disability (20.1%), lack of awareness (17.2%), unemployment (14.0%), caste/ethnic issues (5.9%), large \nfamily size (4.2%), and economic situation (4.2%). The poor and vulnerable groups also see the lack of inherited \nassets, caste/ethnic discrimination, and lack of livestock as the main causes of their poverty.  \n \nSurveys conducted during project preparation identify four broad socioeconomic groups, based on their level of assets \nand vulnerability. Among them, 55% are in poverty  with food unsecured. About 15% of households identified \nthemselves as well-off, mainly of Brahmin and Newar origin. The main livelihood characteristics were identified as \ninherited assets; more than 3 ha of land, property, good education, remittance from foreign employment, pension from \nBritain, income from other business and employment, cardamom cultivator farmers, and food surplus. About 63.6% of \ntheir income comes from the agriculture sector. About 30% of households considered themselves in a medium \nsocioeconomic condition, comprising the Brahmin, Chhetri, Lama, Limbu, Newar, Rai, Sherpa, and Tamang groups. \nThe main livelihood characteristics of those households are food sufficiency, job/pension holding, larger landholding \n(mostly rain fed), permanent national and foreign employment, have cattle and cash crops, small business, and \neducation. About 66.4% of their income comes from the agriculture sector. About 30% of households said they were \npoor and lacked food security, education, and permanent paid jobs. They have small landholdings, high dependency \nrate, weak financial capacity, few cattle, and rely on daily wage labor in Nepal and India. The highest share of \n ", "  Appendix 13  55 \nhouseholds in this category comprises Gurung, Magar, Dalit, and some ethnic groups. About 63.3% of their income \ncomes from the agriculture sector. About 25% of households said they were vulnerable or very poor; most of them \nbelong to the Dalit and Tharu communities. They are characterized by chronic food deficiency, underemployment, high \ndependency ratio because of illness and disability, low education and literacy rate, lack of inherited assets and land, \nindebtedness, and very low capital and financial assets. About 42.9% of their income comes from the agriculture \nsector. \n \nThese two groups, the poor and the vulnerable (comprising 55%), have very little capital, natural, social, and economic \nassets; and most continue to adopt a survival strategy to secure food, basic needs, and shelter either through \nsubsistence farming or daily wage labor on- and off-farm. Grant assistance from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR) is envisaged with a view to supplement the Project in four districts, improve the livelihood of subsistence \nfarmers and disadvantaged groups in the agricultural market chain, and provide access to opportunities created by the \nProject.  The  JFPR  assistance  will  (i)  provide  seed  money  and  seed  packages  to  subsistence  farmers  and \ndisadvantaged groups in all 11 districts to enable them to participate in the activities and benefit from the Project; (ii) \nsupport groups of disadvantaged people to get involved in commercial agriculture; (iii) follow up on the needs and \ndemands for semiskilled and skilled labor in the agricultural value chain, and make market-oriented training accessible \nto agricultural wage laborers in search of better employment opportunities. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes     No \n \nThe Project was designed based on two approaches, the value chain approach and the participatory learning system \napproach. The value-chain approach focuses on the interaction of participants in the commercial agriculture sector, \nand their contribution and interest in adding value in a series of networks. The participatory learning system approach \nis based on the concept of collaborative, experiential learning, and enabled stakeholders to participate in designing and \nvalidating the project approach. Information was collected from field visits, field work for social analysis, stakeholders\u2019 \nparticipatory workshops, other stakeholders\u2019 consultations, background reports, district profiles, and regional database. \n \nThe commercial concept and institutional arrangement proposed in the Project are new to Nepal. The level of \nownership, interest, adoption, and participation of the stakeholders will depend on their common understanding. Given \nthe traditional social behavior and stratification of the potential beneficiaries and the relatively low level of education \nand international references, the understanding of the project objectives and processes is a major challenge to active \nand sustained participation in building effective commercial value chains. Therefore, the project standardization \nworkshops and awareness campaign on project values, objectives, implementation procedures, results, and benefits \nwill be launched. For subsistence farmers, awareness, self-esteem building, increased labor productivity in wage labor, \nand less discriminatory attitudes and behavior will be part of the mobilization campaign. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn the project area, females represent 48.5% of the population; 59.1% are illiterate (33.5% of males are illiterate). \nWomen perform most of the routine domestic-related tasks. Though women and men share activities in agricultural \nproduction, postharvest, and processing, women are generally paid less than men for the same work and for the same \nnumber of hours. Women have lower access than men to credit, information, and technology. Trade leadership is \nlimited for women. \n \nThe problem of gender imbalance and inequity in accessing resources is to be addressed by simultaneously (i) \nunderstanding the nature of intrahousehold relationships; (ii) seeking economic opportunities along with commercial \nagriculture activities; (iii) reducing vulnerability and identifying mitigation measures arising from commercial agriculture; \n(iv) enhancing the capability of women to engage directly (or benefit indirectly) in commercial agriculture; (v) integrating \nwomen into effective value chains and increasing representation and decision making of women in commercial \nagriculture; and (vi) increasing representation of women in project structures, CAA, and local government. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes. A Gender Action Plan is in Appendix 14.     No  \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \nE.

Use concepts, approaches, and \nlogical framework that are simple, pragmatic, and \nemployment-based. \n\u2022  If field monitoring becomes difficult for government \nand NGO agents, consider using an independent \ncross-cutting field surveillance team, based on the \nWorld Food Programme model, as an effective, less \nrisky, and less costly project monitoring solution. \n\u2022  Based on the recommendations of the peace and \nconflict impact assessment (Supplementary Appendix \nA), undertaken in 2005, and the most recent \nencouraging political developments, foster \ntransparent project budget allocation and spending, \nand build local capacity.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \n1.  In  the  project  area,  women  represent  48.5%  of  the  population;  59.1%  are  illiterate \n(33.5% of males are illiterate). Women and men participate equally in agricultural production, \nbut the participation of women in commercial agriculture is limited. In addition to farm activities, \nwomen perform most of the routine domestic tasks. Women are generally paid less than men \nfor the same farm or processing work and for the same number of hours. Women have lower \naccess than men to credit, information, and technology. Commercial agriculture development \nneeds  to  increase  opportunities  for  women,  not  only  as  unskilled  laborers  but  also  as \nincreasingly skilled laborers and more confident decision makers. \n \n2.  Women\u2019s Livelihood Opportunities. Due to the male-oriented inheritance distribution \nsystem, traditional gender labor allocation in households, and traditional local norms on gender \naccess to social services, women are less prepared than men to utilize evolving economic \nopportunities. While men are engaged in permanent jobs, international and urban migration, \nbusiness, and trade, women tend to remain at home to maintain house and farm, and ensure \nchildren\u2019s  education.  Women  are  usually  not  well  paid  because  they  are  unskilled,  as  a \nconsequence of their low level of education. Without additional awareness, training programs, \ngroup organization, and access to credit, improving the livelihoods of rural women will be \ndifficult. \n \n3.  Conflict-Related Gender Issues. Several districts of the Eastern Development Region \nare affected by violence, insecurity, extortion, and looting of banks. Women\u2019s involvement in the \nMaoist army and political cadres has brought a major break in the social fabric of rural areas. \nWomen\u2019s household and farm-related work burden has increased dramatically because many \nmale family members have left the villages. Women must now deal with both security forces and \nMaoists. Brahmin and Chhetri women who were traditionally forbidden to plough fields or repair \nthe roofs of houses are taking on these tasks, both out of necessity and because of the evolving \negalitarian value system. The number of women employed in agriculture, as farm laborers, and \nas workers in agro-industry decreased during the conflict. However, positive impacts may be \nexpected as the ban on (i) uncontrolled production, sale, and public abuse of alcohol; and (ii) \ngambling is reportedly being implemented in Maoist-influenced areas. \n \n4.  Strategy  to  Redress  Gender  Imbalance.  The  problems  of  gender  imbalance  and \ninequity in accessing resources will be addressed by simultaneously (i) understanding the \ntraditional linear and customary systems that define the nature of intrahousehold relationships; \n(ii) seeking economic opportunities along with commercial agriculture activities; (iii) reducing \nvulnerability  and  identifying  mitigation  measures  arising  from  commercial  agriculture;  (iv) \nenhancing skills of women to engage directly in or benefit indirectly from commercial agriculture; \n(v) integrating women into effective value chains and increasing representation of women in \ndecision-making in commercial agriculture; and (vi) increasing awareness, information, and \nnetworking.
