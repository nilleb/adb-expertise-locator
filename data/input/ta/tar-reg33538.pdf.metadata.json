INTRODUCTION\n1. This regional technical assistance (TA), Regulatory Systems and Networking of Water\nUtilities  and  Regulatory  Bodies,  has  been  prepared  in  support  of  reforms  that  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other agencies are promoting in the water supply and sanitation\nsector,1 and are being endorsed by ADB's developing member countries (DMCs).2 Several\nDMCs have expressed an interest in identifying and establishing appropriate forms of regulatory\nsystems to oversee and guide autonomous water supply and sewerage agencies. The World\nBank and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC)3 strongly support\nthese initiatives. Although no formal fact-finding was undertaken, it is proposed that 10 DMCs\n(Bangladesh, the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri\nLanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam) actively participate in this TA. The TA framework is attached as\nAppendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The water supply and sanitation sector in ADB's DMCs has been characterized over the\nlast 20 years by a lack of autonomy extended to water utilities in terms of staffing (salaries and\nappointments) and financial management (tariffs and approvals for capital expenditure). The\ncontrol over tariffs by local or other governments, which variously cite elections, lack of utility\nefficiency, or unaffordability to the poor, as reasons for curtailing tariff revisions, has been\nextreme and has seriously affected autonomy. This is the main factor in water being treated as\na social rather than an economic good. While treated as a social good (i.e., with considerable\ngovernment  subsidy  of  costs),  the  funds  for  making  it  available  publicly  pass  through\ngovernment  agencies,  and  investment  and  maintenance  decisions  often  acquire  political\novertones. When treated as an economic good, the consumers pay for most of the costs and\ninvestments and control the services. Typically, there are three responses to tariff setting by\npolitical expediency. The first is a transparent policy on tariffs and cost recovery, which is made\navailable to all, including consumers. The second is a regulatory body that is independent of\ngovernment, but tasked with implementing the government policy. The third level of defense is a\nprivate sector contract that is legal and binding.\n3. In effect, a regulatory body is required when public or privately managed water and\nsewerage systems are functioning. A regulatory body functions as a buffer between potential\ngovernment domination of a public utility and consumer interests and assures that accepted\npolicy is properly implemented. In privately managed systems, a regulatory body assures that\nconsumers are provided an efficient service at fair cost. This TA is concerned with regulatory\nbodies because, although so legislated, the water utilities that are public enterprises have not\nbeen allowed to exercise their autonomy. Loan covenants on tariffs have invariably run into\nproblems of delayed compliance, which leave the utilities financially weak. When \u201cprivatization\u201d\nemerged as a panacea for ill-managed public water utilities in the 1990s, it was realized that\nsome form of regulation was needed. However, the \"regulation by contract\" that developed is\nnot working well. It is far better to have a regulatory body established before any privatization\ncontract is awarded, because such a body can assist in the negotiations, making administration\n                                               \n1  A complementary regional TA for public-private-community partnerships in urban services for the poor is under\npreparation. Close collaboration of staff concerned and sharing of relevant findings of the two TAs will be pursued.\nThis TA focuses on regulatory systems for tariff reform while the other TA focuses on how private sector\ninterventions can help the urban poor. The findings of this TA, especially in regard to how regulatory systems will\nensure the poor are not disadvantaged, will be fed into the other TA.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 20 January 2000.\n3   A global body based in Geneva.", "2\nof  the  contract  better  for  both  sides.    At  the  same  time,  regulation  and  some  form  of\nbenchmarking of utility performance is needed, regardless of privatization. Thus, one country\nmay have the private sector, a national water authority, and local authorities, each operating\nwater supply and sewerage systems, and each in need of some common form of regulation.\n4. The DMCs' regulatory bodies in the water supply and sanitation sector are in their\ninfancy. Existing ones were mostly created by contract. In Bangkok, Colombo, and Kathmandu,\nefforts are being made to set up regulatory bodies. Some of the key questions that have arisen\nduring the course of debate on regulation and that this TA will aim to address are: Should\nregulatory bodies be multipurpose or just sector specific? Should they be national, provincial, or\nstate bodies?  Will every regulatory body be unique or is there a blue print to follow? Who\nshould comprise regulatory bodies? What human and financial resources are needed? From\nwhere should they source their funds? What should be their roles and functions?\n5. A regional or international agency is needed to assist DMCs in knowledge management\nconcerned  with  regulatory  frameworks  and  to  encourage  long-term  sustainability  of  this\ninitiative. WSSCC has promoted the setting up of the water utilities partnership in South Asia\nunder the umbrella of the WSSCC, and is an appropriate agency for this purpose, as it is mostly\na facilitator of good practices. One objective is to provide an arrangement for the water utilities\nin South Asia to develop knowledge and so capacity, through exchange of information, and\ntalking to and learning from each other. The partnership will cover a number of topics but will\ninclude governance, public-private  partnerships,  regulatory  frameworks,  and  benchmarking.\nADB and the World Bank have agreed in principle to support this initiative. The executive\ndirector of the Melamchi Water Supply Development Board in Kathmandu, Nepal, will be the\nfocal person for the partnership. A stakeholder workshop is planned to be held in Kathmandu, in\nJuly 2000. Another objective is to provide a network for regulatory bodies in the region so they\ncan learn from one another and be mutually supportive. This TA is an appropriate vehicle to\nhelp  introduce  regulatory  frameworks  and  benchmarking  in  the  region.  By  a  partnership\nbetween ADB and WSSCC, and regulatory body networking, the benefits of this TA will be\nsupported and ADB will be able to promote better regional cooperation in the sector. WSSCC\nhas assured ADB that it will sustain in the long-term the networking initiated under the TA. The\nrationale for networking is attached as Appendix 2.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n6. The longer term objectives of this TA are to (i) facilitate the recognition of water as an\neconomic  rather  than  social  good,  and  (ii)  promote  autonomous  and  efficient  water  and\nsewerage utilities. Both objectives aim to improve water supply and  sewerage  services  in\nDMCs.  The  specific  objectives  of  this  TA  are  to  (i)  help  DMC  governments  establish\nindependent regulatory bodies for the water supply and sewerage sector, and (ii) support a\nSouth Asia water utility partnership to promote knowledge management and networking on\nwater supply and sanitation reforms.\nB. Scope\n7. The TA will have two parts. Part A will consist of three components. The first will be a\nbrief review of existing regulatory frameworks for water supply and sewerage in both developed\nand developing countries around the world. The review will be followed by presentation of 10\nrepresentative case studies. These studies will identify good practices and policies that have", "3\nresulted in sound regulatory systems. Lessons will be drawn and conclusions presented in the\ncontext of what DMCs might usefully adopt. The second component will entail consultants in the\n10 selected DMCs4 identifying key stakeholders, including government, water utilities, local\nauthorities,  private  sector,  nongovernment  organizations,  politicians,  and  consumers;  and\nascertaining their views on the nature and scope of regulation that is needed, and how it might\nbe implemented. A one-day workshop will be convened to allow stakeholders to interact and\nreach consensus on some of the topics. Each DMC will prepare its own regulatory systems\nreport.  The  third  component  will  be  a  three-day  forum  in  Manila  attended  by  two\nrepresentatives, one senior government official and a prominent civilian, from each of 20 DMCs.\nIn this forum, the report prepared under the first component will be presented and discussed,\ntogether with the reports from the 10 selected DMCs. Thereafter, practical guidelines will be\ndeveloped for DMC governments to implement  regulatory  reforms  in  their  countries.  Each\ncountry will need to have its own unique design for its regulatory arrangements and some may\neven reject the idea altogether. Staff from the World Bank and other international agencies\nassisting the water supply and sewerage sector, including WSSCC, will be invited to the forum\nto share their views. Representatives of the private sector, especially of agencies that have had\nexperience operating in a regulated environment, will also be invited.\n8. Part B of the TA will include networking for a South Asia water utility partnership and will\nbe conducted over two years. The TA's support for this activity will include the establishing a\nwebsite  and  hiring  webmaster,  and  establishing  computerized  nodes  in  six  countries  for\ngathering  information  (national  sector  coordinator  plus  equipment)  and for  annual  regional\nmeetings of the participants. Part B will include networking among regional regulatory bodies for\nthe water supply sector. Support will be in the form of computers and staff at each regulatory\nbody office.\n9. At  the  conclusion  of  the  forum,  a  comprehensive  report  will  be  prepared  that  will\nencapsulate Part A of the TA. The report will be disseminated widely to governments, civil\nsociety, and the private sector. It will be used as a foundation for policy dialogue in DMCs to\nestablish regulatory systems. The report will also feed into a forum proposed to be held under\nthe  auspices  of  a  complementary  TA  on  public-private-community  partnerships  in  urban\nservices for the poor (see footnote 1).\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The estimated cost of the TA is $500,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the cost on a\ngrant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Approximately\n40 percent of the cost is for consulting services; 30 percent for DMC participation; 10 percent for\nthe workshops, forum, reports, and communication; and 20 percent for networking. Details of\nthe cost estimate are in Appendix 3.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n11. A domestic consultant, experienced in water supply and sewerage activities in Asia, will\nbe  recruited  to  assist  in  the  day-to-day  logistical  and  organizational  aspects  of  the  TA\nimplementation  and  to  work  closely  with  ADB  staff.  An  international  individual  consultant,\nsourced from a firm with experience in regulatory arrangements for  the  water  supply and\nsewerage sector, will be recruited to undertake the study from his or her own office. This will\n                                               \n4 DMCs were selected on the basis of their experience with regulatory bodies in this sector or potential for\nintroduction of a regulatory body in the near future.", "4\nrequire  considerable  networking  with  contacts  in  a  number  of  countries.  One  domestic\nconsultant, in each of the 10 selected DMCs will be recruited on an individual basis to identify\nstakeholders and ascertain their views. The domestic consultants will have a strong background\nin  the  water  supply  and  sewerage  sector.  They  will  work  in  collaboration  with  the  lead\nGovernment agency in the water supply and sewerage sector in each country.\n12. The consulting inputs will be international (4 person-months), and domestic (26 person-\nmonths). Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 4. The consultants\nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.\n13. The TA will be implemented over two years. The study is to be completed in three\nmonths. The domestic consultations will be completed over two months in parallel with the\nstudy. The material from the study and domestic consultations will be reviewed in Manila by a\ndomestic consultant and ADB staff, and preparations made for the regional forum in months four\nand five. During the sixth month, the forum will be held and the report printed and disseminated.\nPart B of the TA, involving the networking of water utilities in South Asia and regulatory bodies,\nwill extend for 18 months beyond the regional forum. Thus, the TA is expected to commence on\n1 August 2000 and be completed by 31 July 2002. A measure of the effectiveness of this TA will\nbe the extent to which the 10 participating DMCs have established, or begin to establish,\nregulatory bodies in the water supply and sanitation sector by 31 July 2002.\nIV.

International Consultant\n2. Undertaking a study from his or her home office, the consultant will research literature\nover the last 10 years on regulatory arrangements for water supply and sewerage in developed\nand developing countries. An annotated bibliography will be prepared for all relevant materials.\nThe  consultant  will  interview,  by  e-mail  or  other  means,  contacts  in  different  countries,\nespecially including those working in regulatory bodies in the water supply and sewerage sector.\nA selection of 10 representative case studies will be made and, after Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) confirms that the proposed study topics are acceptable, the case studies (8-10 pages in\nlength each) will be prepared. The scope of the case studies will include but not necessarily be\nlimited to descriptions of (i) the  driving force or enabling environment for  establishing  the\nregulatory arrangements and when this was effected; (ii) the relevant legislation required to\nestablish  the  regulatory  body;  (iii)  the  role  and  functions  of  the  regulatory  body;  (iv)  the\ncomposition  and  selection  of  the  regulatory  body;  (v)  the  financial  and  human  resources\navailable to the regulatory body; and (vi) the perceptions of the success or otherwise of the\nregulatory body since inception, especially as regards its independence and its ability to carry\nout its mandate. The consultant will also prepare a general report on the findings, making\nreference to objectives, composition, role, functions, resources, and effectiveness of various\nregulatory arrangements. In Manila for the three-day forum, the consultant will review domestic\nconsultant reports and assist ADB staff and the consultant to prepare an agenda for the forum\nand then serve as the chief facilitator of that forum. Finally, the consultant will compile a record\nof the proceedings of the forum. The expected total input will be 4 person-months.\nC. Domestic TA Implementation Consultant (Manila)\n3.
