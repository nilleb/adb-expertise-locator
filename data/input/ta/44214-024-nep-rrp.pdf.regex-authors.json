I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategic \nClimate Fund1 and (ii) proposed partial administration of a grant to be provided by the Nordic \nDevelopment Fund (NDF), both to Nepal for Building Climate Resilience of Watersheds in \nMountain Eco-Regions.2 \n \n2.  The  project  aims  to  provide  access  to  more  reliable  water  resources  for  domestic \npurposes and irrigation for communities living in the watersheds of Nepal\u2019s river systems, which \nare significantly vulnerable to climate change.3 The watersheds selected lie in six districts in the \nFar-Western Development Region: Achham, Baitaidi, Bajhang, Bajura, Dadeldhura, and Doti. \nAccess to and reliability of water resources will be improved through a participatory program of \nintegrated watershed management with interventions in upland areas to increase surface water \nstorage  and  groundwater  recharge.  Communities  now  recognize  that  water  resources  are \nlimited. They have expressed their commitment toward protecting and enhancing their water \nresources. The project will demonstrate ways to protect water sources while at the same time \ndeveloping them for efficient use. The communities in the project area will have more reliable \nwater supplies in the dry season. Major beneficiaries will be women and disadvantaged groups.4 \nAs the first large-scale intervention by ADB in watershed management in Nepal, the project will \ndemonstrate participatory watershed management planning and build the capacity of all levels \nof government for integrated watershed development, specifically focusing on water resources. \nIt is intended that lessons from this project will influence the ways in which rural water supply \nand irrigation projects are designed. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  project  is  one  of  five  components  in  Nepal\u2019s  Strategic  Program  for  Climate \nResilience (SPCR), which was endorsed by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience Sub-\nCommittee in June 2011.5 The SPCR aims to build long-term climate resilience through an \nintegrated water resource and ecosystem-based approach, and to yield lessons on how best to \nbuild  resilience  in  vulnerable  mountain  regions.  It  responds  to  the  government\u2019s  National \nAdaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) for climate change, which was finalized in September \n2010. The NAPA promotes a watershed and landscape-level approach to deal with issues \nrelated to food security, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, energy use, settlements, public health, \nand governance. Climate variability and change in Nepal is projected to exacerbate existing \nthreats to food, water, and livelihood security through alterations in the quantity and timing of \nprecipitation and runoff, more atmospheric water vapor and evaporation, and progressive loss of \nglacier and snowpack storage in basin headwaters. \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.  \n4  Disadvantaged groups are defined in a supporting document, Gender and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  The other four SPCR components deal with building resilience to climate-induced hazards through improved flood \nforecasting  and  early  warning  systems,  managing  climate  change  risk  in  development  planning,  protecting \nendangered flora and fauna, and providing incentives for private sector assistance in climate change adaptation. \nThe sub-committee is the decision-making body that oversees the operations and activities of the program. It \ncomprises representatives of contributor and eligible recipient countries to the fund. ", "2 \n4.  The selected watersheds for project investment are in the West Seti subbasin of the \nKarnali River Basin. The subbasin originates from the snowfields and glaciers around the twin \npeaks of Api and Nampa in the south-facing slopes of the main Himalayas. The Lower West \nSeti  and  Budhi  Ganga  watersheds  have  been  selected  for  the  project  because  a  study \nconducted during project design assessed their vulnerability to climate change as high; their \npopulation  is  estimated  at  496,205. 6  Annual  precipitation  in  the  subbasin  varies  from \n743 millimeters to 3,351 millimeters under current climate conditions, about 75% of which falls \nduring a 3-4 month monsoon season. Water scarcity is a significant and widespread problem \namong these communities, occurring every year in the dry season.7 The mean per capita \nincome based on a household survey is NRs21,934 per year.8 More than 85% of households in \nthese watersheds live in scattered dwellings close to natural springs and patches of more gently \nsloping land. They have subsistence lifestyles based on mixed agriculture, grazing activity, and \ncollection of non-timber forest products.  \n5.  The watershed areas have average slopes of almost 30 degrees, encompassing narrow \nvalleys  with  perennial  streams.  There  is  limited  cultivatable  land  in  river  flats  and  on  the \nhillsides, where there is some land with a slope of less than 20 degrees. Transport and other \nservices are severely limited as most settlements have only foot-track access. Each of the six \ndistricts in the two watersheds has a small town with road access, but these roads may be \nblocked by landslides during monsoon periods. There are agricultural markets only in the district \ncenters. The towns have electricity supply but generation shortages limit it to 5\u201310 hours a day \ndepending on location and season. Villages have even more limited access to electricity.  \n6.  Global climate model projections downscaled for Nepal for 2030\u20132061 were analyzed for \nthe subbasin during project design.9 A temperature rise of at least 2\u00b0C by the mid-21st century \nis  projected  to  affect  the  hydrological  cycle,  which  in  turn  will  have  an  impact  on  water \navailability, runoff, and the discharge regime of rivers.10 In general, climate change projections \nshow that precipitation will slightly increase in the West Seti subbasin. Precipitation will increase \nin pre-monsoon months and decrease in the monsoon, whereas a mixed trend (both increasing \nand decreasing) is projected in the project sub-watersheds in the winter and after the monsoon. \nSome models project increasing trends and others project decreasing trends in annual water \nyield and actual evapotranspiration. In general, climate change projections show that annual \nriver flow volume will slightly decrease. However, it is difficult to make conclusions regarding \nprecipitation and flow trends. Uncertainty is the main risk that can be attributed to climate \nchange. Another change reported was increasing intensity of rainfall, particularly during rain \nshowers  in  the  pre-monsoon  period. This  increased  intensity  would  reduce  the  amount of \ninfiltration and groundwater recharge. Development of storage facilities is an effective way to \n                                                \n6   International Water Management Institute. 2012.

The  project  is  in  Nepal's  confirmed  project  pipeline  for  ADB  administration  and \ncontributes  to  three  of  the  country  sector  outputs  for  2012\u20132014:  (i)  sustainable  rural \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  accountable  service  delivery,  and  (iii)  increased  representation  of  target \ngroups in governance structures. The project conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan (2011\u2013\n2020) and supports its priority of integrated water resource management to strengthen the \nwater\u2013food nexus.12 The design of the proposed project is based on experience and techniques \ndeveloped by the Department of Soil Conservation and Watershed Management (DSCWM), \nlessons  from  international  nongovernment  organizations  and  research  organizations,  and \ninternational and national experience in watershed management.13 It aims to tie in with Nepal\u2019s \nlocal adaptation plans of action on climate change.14 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The expected impact will be that climate resilience in Nepal\u2019s mountain communities is \nimproved.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  that  selected  communities  that  are  significantly \nvulnerable to climate change have access to more reliable water resources. About 45,000 \nhouseholds are expected to benefit from improved water availability during the dry season to \nsupport domestic and agricultural uses. The spring or surface water sources are expected to \nbecome more reliable; the dry season water yield will either remain the same or increase.  \nC.  Outputs \n9.  To achieve its expected outcome, the project will have four outputs: (i) participating \ncommunities  have  improved  catchment  management  and  new  or  improved  water  storage \ninfrastructure; (ii) communities and government manage water and land in an integrated and \ninclusive manner within watersheds; (iii) government adopts knowledge-based approaches for \nintegrated water and land management and improved water reliability and accessibility in the \nwake of climate change; and (iv) project management support is provided. \n \n10.  Water source catchment management and storage infrastructure. The project will \nbe implemented through about 100 community-based subprojects. Communities will manage \ncatchment areas for development and protection of their water sources (springs and streams). \nThis will include: (i) protection of the area surrounding the water source, and preparation and \nimplementation of water source catchment management plans;15 (ii) treatment of gully erosion, \nand slope and landslide stabilization that threatens the water sources, water infrastructure, and \nbeneficiary  communities;  (iii)  construction  of  water  collection  chambers,  spring  boxes  or \ninfiltration galleries; (iv) construction of water conservation ponds and storage for irrigation and \n                                                \n11  International Water Management Institute.

Manila. \n13  Some lessons include the need for better understanding of the link between the hydrologic cycle and land \nmanagement,  planning  development  according  to  watershed  rather  than  administrative  boundaries,  and  a \nparticipatory planning approach. \n14  Under the Nepal Climate Change Support Programme of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. \n15  Communities will establish the catchment area for the water source and define measures to manage land use, \nincluding regulating grazing, and fodder and firewood collection in the catchment. The executing agency will make \nagreements with community development groups on the responsibility of managing and protecting the catchment \narea, and introduce productive conservation measures such as planting of fruit and fodder trees and grass, and \nsustainable agroforestry. \n ", "4 \nlivestock; and (v) construction of drinking water storage tanks and tap stands. Water storage will \nhelp sustain the use of limited water during the dry season, thereby reducing the time people \n(especially  women)  spend  collecting  water,  and  increasing  the  irrigated  agricultural  area. \nCatchment improvement measures will help stabilize or augment the yield of water sources. \n \n11.  Inclusive  and  integrated  management  of  water  and  land.  Implementation  of \nsubprojects will particularly promote water conservation in the catchment areas and tackle \nshortage issues that result in additional labor for women or pose difficulties for disadvantaged \ngroups, who often have access only to less reliable water sources and suffer disproportionally in \ncase of water shortage. The project will also provide participating communities with education \nand facilitate programs on water conservation practices (including micro-irrigation), methods for \nmaintaining  soil  moisture  in  agriculture,  grazing  and  fodder  management,  and  ways  to \nregenerate  vegetative  cover.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  DSCWM\u2019s  capacity  in  sub-\nwatershed management planning to improve water security and boost watershed resilience. \nSub-watershed management plans will be prepared that describe the watersheds\u2019 biophysical \nand  socioeconomic  conditions  and  challenges,  and  build  a  geographic  information  system \ndatabase  of  existing  water  infrastructure  and  water-related  development  interventions. \nCommunity-driven interventions for water source catchment management and enhancement will \nbe included. The watershed planning process will reinforce the DSCWM\u2019s capacity to determine \nand monitor priority interventions, and the department can use the  geographic information \nsystem database in planning its future programs. \n \n12.  Lessons for improving access to and reliability of water resources. As the project \nwill be implemented in six districts, this output will focus on documenting and sharing lessons \nfrom  project  implementation  to  all  DSCWM  staff  through  strategic  and  targeted  technical \nassistance. A knowledge management plan will be implemented, with activities to document and \nincorporate lessons into country programs, and to foster knowledge sharing among country \nstakeholders and in international climate change forums. The DSCWM\u2019s capacity to monitor the \nimpacts of project interventions will be strengthened through preparation of a management \ninformation system and expertise in benefit monitoring and evaluation. Other evaluations will be \nconducted on pertinent topics such as changes in hydrology due to catchment management \nmeasures,  how  communities  negotiate  water  allocations,  behavioral  change  in  collective \nmanagement  of  interventions,  and  demand  management.  Project  experiences,  impact \nassessments, and lessons will be shared globally as part of the SPCR\u2019s global learning support \nprogram. This output will be financed by the NDF. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The DSCWM will be the executing agency. It will appoint a project director to head a \nproject management unit (PMU) to handle project implementation. The district soil conservation \noffices  in  Baitadi,  Dadeldhura,  and  Doti  districts  will  be  responsible  for  subproject \nimplementation. Policy direction will be provided by an interagency steering committee. The \nPMU will be based in Dadeldhura, with a full-time project director appointed by the DSCWM at \nclass II level. The project director will reside in Dadeldhura but frequently visit Kathmandu on \nproject business. The DSCWM will recruit from the market or depute 36 mid-level technicians \nfor full-time field-based project work, and will designate three district soil conservation officers \nas environment officers for the project. The government will depute an account officer and \naccountant to work in the PMU. Senior consultant specialists will support the PMU and the \ndistrict  soil  conservation  offices.  To  ensure  an  efficient  project  start,  the  government  has \nrequested that ADB undertake the shortlisting, evaluation, and ranking of the lead firms and \ntheir proposals. Contract negotiations, and approval and signing of contracts will remain the \ngovernment's responsibility, with ADB assistance and oversight.  \n16.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n17.  The  yield  of  many  local  water  sources  in  the  hills  (springs  and  small  streams)  is \ndeclining, especially during the dry season, because of deforestation and land degradation in \nthe catchment areas of these sources. The effects of climate change might further aggravate \nthe situation, as the amount and timing of rainfall is expected to be altered, there may be less \nsnow melt, and actual evapotranspiration may increase. Therefore, the project emphasizes the \nrestoration and protection of such catchment areas, along with building capacity of communities \nfor catchment management. An agreement with beneficiary communities to create catchment \nmanagement areas in which grazing and fodder and forest products are regulated will be a \nprecondition  for  project  assistance.  Catchment  restoration  and  protection  will  stabilize  and ", "7 \nimprove the yield of local water sources in the medium term. To mitigate acute daily water \nshortage in the short term, the project will provide new or improved water intake and water \nstorage facilities where possible. To avoid failure and/or high operation and maintenance costs, \nthe  project  emphasizes  a  high  standard  of  design  and  construction  for  this  infrastructure. \nOperation and maintenance plans will be prepared and implemented for each management \narea within a subproject. Soil and water interventions will include landslide stabilization and \ndrainage works, hill slope and gully erosion control, bioengineering works for slope stabilization, \nland terracing, water intake structures such as spring boxes and infiltration galleries, water \ntransmission pipelines, drinking water storage tanks, conservation ponds, water storage for \nirrigation, and water troughs for livestock. Organizing and training of the local community for \ncatchment  management  and  maintenance  of  the  new  or  improved  infrastructure  will  be \nincorporated into the early stages of subproject development. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  The  economic  and  financial  analyses  focused  on  the  economic  feasibility  of  three \nsample subprojects.18 For all three, quantified benefits were assessed by comparing present \ncrop production with the production expected after the introduction of new or more reliable \nirrigation water supply through the development of water storage facilities. For the Dadeldhura \nand Doti subprojects, benefits also accrue from the time savings for households collecting water \nduring the dry season. The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) estimated for the three \nsubprojects are 14.2% for Bajura, 21.4% for Dadeldhura, and 14.9% for Doti. All are not highly \nsensitive to changes in key cost and benefit variables, but for Bajura and Doti some changes of \nkey variables tested in the sensitivity analysis lead to EIRRs below 12%. In particular, the EIRR \nof the Doti subproject would decrease to 11.2% if costs increased by 10% and benefits were \nreduced by 10% throughout the project life. Under the same scenario, the EIRR of the Bajura \nsubproject would decrease to 10.7%, and to 10.8% if only 80% of the command area were \ndeveloped, and to 11.9% if benefits were delayed 1 year. The subprojects remain viable since \nsignificant benefits have not been quantified. \n19.  The project is expected to benefit at least 45,000 households with more reliable water \nresources for irrigation, drinking, and other domestic uses, or for livestock, especially during the \ndry season. Other households will benefit from measures to improve the reliability of water \nsources, stabilize eroding and unstable areas, and other similar interventions. Together these \nmeasures will improve the resilience of watersheds and those living in them to changing climatic \nconditions.  Communities  will  contribute  commitment  money  before  the  interventions  are \nconstructed, and these funds will be set aside for major repairs, and operation and maintenance \nof  infrastructure.  Communities  will  be  responsible  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  any \ninfrastructure after project implementation.  \nC.  Governance \n20.  The project supports local governance, financial, and administrative decentralization, \nand oversight of public development expenditure by deepening transparency and accountability \nof public service delivery through local government units that select and manage their own \nsubprojects, and by building the capacity of the DSCWM and its district offices for financial \ndiscipline, responsibility, transparency, and accountability. A financial management assessment \nof the DSCWM was conducted, and a risk assessment and risk management plan is included in \n                                                \n18  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nthe linked documents.19 The assessment concluded that the DSCWM's capacity is sufficient to \ncarry out the project with training and oversight from ADB. The project aims to support the post-\nconflict  approach  outlined  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  by  identifying  and  managing \npotential conflict risks and opportunities.20 \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the DSCWM. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.21 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  The project will provide the infrastructure needed for increased agricultural production \nand small-scale market gardening, thereby improving food security and income. It will reduce \nthe  time  spent  (mainly  by  women)  collecting  drinking  water.  Other  disadvantaged  groups \n(mainly Dalit) will be particular beneficiaries as the project will give priority to the protection, \nenhancement, and development of the less reliable water sources currently used by these \ngroups.  Participatory  planning  processes  will  improve  social  harmony.  Improvements  in \ncommunity health are anticipated from better water supplies and greater food security. The \nproject is classified as having an effective gender mainstreaming theme. A gender and social \ninclusion plan has been made an integral part of the project design and is covered by one of the \ncovenants.22  \nE.  Safeguards \n23.  Environment. The project is classified as category B for environment as it is unlikely \nthat any proposed subprojects will lead to any irreversible damage. Any subproject that may be \nscreened as category A will not be financed. The project has been designed specifically to \nmanage the impacts of climate change on mountainous communities, and potential impacts \nfrom climate change and natural disasters on the project and its proposed interventions have \nbeen screened.23 Water balances under past and future climate conditions were assessed for \nthe subbasin that hosts the project area to determine the impact of proposed interventions on its \nhydrology.24 Most project interventions will result in positive impacts on the environment, as the \nproject  will  support  the  protection  of  catchment  areas  and  water  sources,  and  improve \ngroundwater recharge. Construction of ponds for irrigation may result in a few negative impacts \nthat  can  easily  be  mitigated.  Once  locations  for  these  ponds  have  been  determined  and \nenvironmental  screening  has  concluded  that  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  are \ndeemed necessary, IEEs will be conducted for the establishment of these ponds. The number of \nIEEs to be conducted will be based on the number and location of ponds. If several ponds are to \nbe constructed within a subcatchment, one IEE may assess the impacts of a cluster of these \nponds. The exact number of IEEs will be determined once the subprojects are finalized. The \napproved environmental assessment and review framework, as disclosed on ADB website, \n                                                \n19  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Nepal  Post-Conflict  Sensitive  Approach:  A  Peace-Building  Tool  (Peace  Filter)  for  Project  Design  and \nImplementation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  Gender Action Plan: Gender and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n23  Disaster and Climate Change Risk Screening Results (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n24  Five general circulation models were downscaled using three regional climate models for Nepal under ADB. 2008. \nTechnical Assistance to Nepal for Strengthening Capacity for Managing Climate Change and the Environment. \nManila (TA 7173-NEP). ", "9 \nprovides guidance on categorization and procedures to be followed during implementation.25 \nContracts for subprojects that require environmental assessments will be awarded only after the \napproval of the IEEs and environmental management plans by ADB and the government (if \nrequired), and will form part of the contract documents. \n24.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized as C. It is designed to be based \non voluntary donation of land, on demand from the rural communities. A voluntary land donation \nframework has been prepared to help assess the involuntary resettlement safeguard status of a \nproposed subproject and confirm that the selection criteria involving the voluntary donation of \nland has been met. Any subproject requiring involuntary land acquisition will be dropped. The \nselection criteria for a subproject is that irrigation improvement is desired by a community whose \nmembers would voluntarily donate small parcels of their land (up to 10% of their agricultural \nlandholding) for the irrigation improvement. By contributing land for the project they become \nprimary beneficiaries of an enhanced irrigation facility. For each subproject with requirements \nfor  new  land,  procedures  have  been  established  to  verify  that  the  land  is  being  provided \nvoluntarily by those who stand to gain directly, and to verify that the subproject will cause no \nimpoverishment or displacement of tenants or bonded labor, and the subproject activity will not \ninvolve land that is traditionally owned or customarily used by indigenous peoples. Resettlement \ndue diligence will also ensure that meaningful consultation has taken place in good faith with all \naffected persons. The land donation will be verified by witnesses and documented. There is a \nprovision for a grievance redress mechanism, mainly to solve issues of coercion for voluntary \ndonation of land, and for donation of land that exceeds 10% of a donor's agricultural land. \n25.  Indigenous  peoples. The project is categorized as C. The communities where the \npotential schemes are located are almost exclusively Chhetri and/or Brahman and Dalit, and \nhave insignificant Janajati (indigenous people) presence. The Janajati individuals have mostly \nmoved into the project area during the road development and are found scattered along the \nroad. They do not constitute a community and are generally not a part of the agrarian system in \nthe project area. An indigenous peoples impact-screening checklist has been prepared that will \nbe used for each proposed subproject to screen out any subproject that will have negative \nimpact  on  indigenous  peoples\u2019  communities.  A few members  of  an  endangered,  nomadic, \nindigenous peoples group\u2014the Raute\u2014occasionally visit the project area in Achham and Doti \ndistricts. To minimize their vulnerability and to conserve the natural resource niche that their \nmarginal livelihood depends on, the project has included, as part of the subproject selection \ncriteria, avoidance of project water storage interventions in land where the Raute are known to \ncamp, even though untapped water sources may exist.26 \n \nF.
