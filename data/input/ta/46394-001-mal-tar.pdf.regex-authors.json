INTRODUCTION \n1.  Malaysia  is  at  a  critical  juncture  in  its  development.  It  has  made  huge  strides  in \nsocioeconomic  development  since  the  1970s,  transforming  itself  from  an  underdeveloped \ncountry reliant on natural resources into a middle-income country with a vibrant manufacturing \nsector. While Malaysia has made strong gains, the current situation poses challenges that have \nled some to suggest that Malaysia is in a middle-income trap.  \n \n2.  The government has proactively taken on these challenges. Recognizing that a new \neconomic model is required, it has issued a comprehensive policy framework through the \nEconomic Transformation Programme (ETP)1 and the Tenth Malaysia Plan (TMP), 2011\u20132015.2  \nIn addition, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has formed an interim country partnership \nstrategy (CPS) with Malaysia to support the government\u2019s implementation of the ETP and the \nTMP.3 In this context, the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad (EXIM Bank) has requested \ntechnical assistance (TA). The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The pillars supporting Malaysia during this rapid economic transformation, as envisioned \nby the government\u2019s policies and backed up by International Monetary Fund and ADB reports, \nare (i) economic growth led by the private sector and increased private capital investments, \nincluding through public\u2013private partnership (PPP); (ii) market liberalization to encourage trade \nand investment, particularly direct private sector investment that supports inclusive growth and \npromotes an environment conducive to business by, for example, ensuring that Malaysia\u2019s \nexport financing is geared toward strengthening exports; and (iii) macroeconomic stability and \ncorresponding policy tools for inclusive growth.4 Direct private sector investments that support \ninclusive growth and promote an environment conducive to business will ensure that Malaysia\u2019s \nexport  financing  is  geared  toward  strengthening  exports.  Supporting  export  financing  from \ninstitutions like the EXIM Bank is particularly important as export expansion moderated to 14.5% \nin 2011 from 26.4% in 2010. These initiatives for export and regional market development will \nsupplement leveraging by the TMP and the ETP of regional initiatives involving the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines \nEast ASEAN Growth Area, and the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle.  \n \n4.  An interim CPS has been formulated to help Malaysia emerge from the middle-income \ntrap  through  private  sector  development,  including  PPP,  and  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration (RCI), particularly by reinforcing outward and commercial orientation. To this end, \nthe major development issues to be addressed by ADB include:  \n(i)  National anchoring of regional cooperation and integration. Anchoring RCI \nat  the  national  level  has  the  dual  benefit  of  contributing  to  Malaysia\u2019s \ndevelopment goals and supporting development in neighboring countries. The \noutward  orientation  inherent  in  this  approach  supports  Malaysia\u2019s  efforts  to \nemerge from the middle-income trap through more competitive and broader trade \nand investment opportunities.  \n                                                \n1  The ETP was issued in 2010 to support the implementation of the TMP with a set of sector-specific and thematic \nprojects and programs called entry point projects.  \n2  Government of Malaysia, Economic Planning Unit. 2010.

Manila.  \n ", "2   \n(ii)  Catalyzing  private  investment.  Malaysia\u2019s  key  economic  challenge  is  to \ndevelop its private sector. By promoting commercial orientation, development \nfinance institutions can boost the ability of Malaysian private enterprises to take \nadvantage  of  regional  market  opportunities.  ADB  can  support  projects  that \ncatalyze private sector participation, including PPPs, in financing infrastructure \ndevelopment, and  projects that support trade finance.  \n(iii)  Maximizing  knowledge  partnership.  The  government  promotes  inclusive \ngrowth. Expanding human capital development, and knowledge and capacity \ndevelopment,  will  be  important  in  this  regard.  In  addition,  as  the  economy \nundergoes the structural transformation envisaged by the TMP and the ETP, a \nmacroeconomic tool to monitor inclusive growth will be needed.  \n \n5.   Tackling these challenges requires knowledge and capacity development TA that can \nhelp (i) monitor various aspects of inclusive growth during the period of structural transformation, \n(ii)  promote  PPP-enabling  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  and  financing,  and  (iii) encourage \noutward-oriented  private  sector  development  based  on  vibrant  export growth  with  effective \nexport financing, which will encourage partnership in global and regional production networks.5 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact of the TA will be stronger development in Malaysia through the effective \nimplementation of the TMP and the ETP. The outcome will be the improved capacity of the \nEXIM  Bank  to  support  export  financing,  which  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  policy \nframework and key to economic transformation in Malaysia. As stated in the TMP and the ETP, \nthe economic transformation of Malaysia is to be based on private sector development, with \nstronger outward and commercial orientation in key institutions. While the TA cannot support all \ngovernment policies, it can have a catalytic impact with a tangible demonstration of ADB\u2019s \nengagement. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The  TA  will  support  export  financing  and  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  ensure \nmacroeconomic stability through inclusive growth and in enabling new engines of growth for an \neconomy during a period of structural transformation. Accordingly, the TA reflects the strategic \npillars of the interim CPS and is designed to provide enhanced capacity and knowledge support \ntoward TMP and ETP implementation. The key outputs of the TA are: (i) The EXIM Bank\u2019s \ninternal risk management procedures and project risk analysis meet international standards; \nand (ii) Cross-border and regional trade and clean energy finance improved. \n \n8.   In line with the interim CPS, ADB will initiate project financing development with the \nEXIM Bank to strengthen cross-border and regional trade and investment initiatives, and to \nsupport clean energy finance across the region. To ensure that ADB\u2019s financing support is \ncomplemented by capacity development support, this TA will focus on internal risk management \nand project risk analysis, as well as on upgrading trade and clean energy finance to develop \nvalue-added services that foster regional trade and investment. In addition to its own outputs, \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2011. Supporting the Tenth Malaysia Plan, 2011-2015. Manila. The original TA, was approved on 15 \nDecember 2011 for $1 million financed from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) on a \nreimbursable basis. This TA results from the EXIM Bank\u2019s request that the export financing component under the \noriginal TA be separated into a nonsovereign TA for it to implement. The original TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 November 2011. \n ", "  3 \nthe TA will arrange for a training program to be implemented with other export\u2013import banks in \nthe region.  \n \n9.   This TA output is based on the strategic framework of engagement between ADB and \nthe government as described above and reflects areas of ADB expertise and experience. In \nparticular, as the TA is financed on a reimbursable basis, ADB needs to deliver high-quality \noutputs on a timely basis, with inputs from relevant departments. Accordingly, the outputs have \nbeen tailored to ensure effective delivery within TA duration and resources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $300,000 to be financed from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-other  sources)  on  reimbursable  basis.  Detailed  procedures  for \nreimbursement will be prepared as part of the TA agreement. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented from 20 December 2012 to 19 December 2013. The EXIM \nBank  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  responsible  for  coordinating  Malaysian  institutions \ninvolved  in  the  TA.  The  ADB  Southeast  Asia  Department's  Regional  Cooperation  and \nOperations Coordination Division will be the ADB focal point.  \n \n12.   A  team  of  consultants  will  provide  advisory,  technical,  and  administrative  support, \nrequiring an estimated 7.5 person-months of international consulting services and 13.5 person-\nmonths of national. Consultants will be engaged individually, as the TA requires only a few \nindividuals with distinct skills. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Staff of the ADB Southeast \nAsia Department\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division will review the \noutputs in coordination with the relevant ADB departments.   \n \n13.   Computer  hardware  and  software  will  be  purchased  in  accordance  with  ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and in coordination with the \nADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and Office of Administrative Services, \nwhere  applicable.  Upon  TA  completion,  any  procured  equipment  will  be  disposed  of  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions.6 Disbursements under the project \nwill be done in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n14.   TA implementation will be monitored through communication with the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  and  with  other  stakeholders,  as  well  as  through  regular  missions, \nconsultations, and reviews. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a reimbursable \nbasis to the Export\u2013Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad for Supporting the Tenth Malaysia Plan, \n2011\u20132015: Advisory to the Export\u2013Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.   \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2009.
