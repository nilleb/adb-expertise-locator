INTRODUCTION \n1.  An economic report for the Fiji Islands under the Pacific Islands Economic Report (PIER) \nseries of Asian Development Bank (ADB) was published in 1999. Since then, there have been \nsignificant changes in the Fiji Islands economy due to the political developments in May 2000. \nAdditionally, the global economy has undergone major changes. In June 2002, the Government \nconfirmed  its  willingness  to  undertake  a  thorough  study  of  the  economy  with  technical \nassistance (TA) from ADB, which would lead to preparation of a new economic report for the \ncountry.1 Following the Government's confirmation, the Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from 7 \nto 12 September 2002. It reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, \nscope, implementation, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The main challenge facing the Fiji Islands is to move to a higher growth path, and \nimprove the income and quality of life of its people. Despite good potential, the Fiji Islands\u2019 \naverage annual economic growth rate has been below 1.5% since the mid-1970s. The factors \nthat  caused  lower  economic  growth  include  political  instability,  weak  governance,  and \nuncertainty over property rights. During this period, the structure of the economy also changed \ngradually with the emergence of garments as a major merchandise export, a decline in the \nshare of agriculture in total output, and further increases in the share of tourism in total foreign \nexchange earnings. The economy continues to change in response to internal and external \ndevelopments. \n \n3.  The country witnessed a general economic slowdown in 2000 following the crisis in May \n2000, which was associated with a decline in tourist arrivals, and a decline in sugar and \ngarments production. There has been a regular out migration of skilled workers since then.  The \nexternal  environment  also  remained  generally  uncertain  over  this  period.  Despite  these \ndifficulties, the management of the Fijian economy since the crisis in May 2000 has been \ncommendable as reflected in a broad-based economic recovery in 2002.  \n \n4.  The Government is currently pursuing a policy to move the economy to a higher growth \npath through increase in the level of investments. The government priorities include increases in \npublic investment, restructuring of the sugar industry, improvement of tourism infrastructure, \ncommercial  exploitation  of  the  maturing  mahogany,  catalyzing  of  private  investments  and \nreversal of its declining trend for more than two decades, and support to small and micro \nenterprise  development.  Increases  in  public  investment  have  raised  the  issue  of  fiscal \nsustainability and highlighted the need for urgent reduction in the operating expenditure. Apart \nfrom sugar, tourism and fisheries have been two major drivers of the economy. In view of the \nnumerous difficulties and long-term prospect of losing preferential access to European markets \nfor the sugar industry, the Government is also exploring new productive opportunities and \nconsidering the potential for crop diversification.2  \n \n5.  The Government has prepared a detailed agenda for the future development of the \ncountry, as reflected in the newly drafted document Rebuilding Confidence for Stability and \nGrowth for a Peaceful and Prosperous Fiji: 2003-2005. The document was discussed in the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 June 2002. \n2  ADB has recently approved two TAs to support sugar industry restructuring, and alternative livelihoods: (i) ADB. \n2002. Technical Assistance to the Fiji Islands for Intermediation of Sugar Sector Restructuring. Manila, and (ii) \nADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Fiji Islands for Preparing the Alternative Livelihoods Project. Manila.  ", "2 \nNational  Economic  Summit  held  in  Suva  in  September  2002.  Earlier,  the  Fiji  Islands  had \ninitiated a comprehensive public sector reform in 1990s. This led to adoption of acts related to \npublic enterprise, public service, and public financial management in 1999. The implementation \nof these acts has encountered many difficulties for reasons including legislative inconsistencies, \nlack of clarity, and capacity constraints. The current Government has decided to review the \nPublic Finance Management Act 1999.   \n \n6.  Through the proposed study of the Fijian economy, the TA will support economic growth, \npublic sector reform, private sector development, and poverty reduction, which is in line with the \nregional and country strategy.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.        Purpose and Output  \n \n7.  The purpose of the TA is to undertake a comprehensive study and prepare an economic \nreport (PIER). The study will review the Fiji Islands' past economic development trends, current \nissues covering relevant sectoral and thematic areas to identify development opportunities, and \nconstraints and policy options, and will provide a timely assessment of the economy and its \nmajor  sectors  for  future  development  prospects.  The  PIER,  therefore,  will  contribute  to \nmacroeconomic management, and development policy formulation. It will also provide inputs for \npreparing a country strategy and program (CSP). In addition, the TA will support preparation of \nrelevant sector road maps, including for tourism and fisheries. \n \n8.  The TA will provide published information on key constraints and opportunities of the \neconomy. Furthermore, the TA will follow a participatory approach in preparing the PIER. Thus it \nwill improve awareness of government officials, private sector, and civil society about current \neconomic issues and prospects of the economy.  \n \nB.        Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The  TA  team  will  work  closely  with  the  Government  to  enhance  feedback, \nunderstanding,  and  ownership.  The  team  will  also  seek  a  range  of  views  from  other  key \nstakeholders, including private business and civil-society groups. The approach to this study will \ninvolve consultations, workshops, and seminars, which will also help disseminate information \nwithin the country while the PIER is being prepared. Special briefing sessions/seminars will be \norganized for senior officials and ministers. The report will be widely distributed as part of ADB\u2019s \nPacific Studies Series.   \n \n10.  The TA will review and analyze the macroeconomic performance of the country in the \nrecent past with a view to capturing the underlying trends and future prospects. It will review and \nanalyze the major sectors of the economy to identify development opportunities, constraints, \nand policy options. This will include analysis and projection of future scenarios in key sectoral \nand thematic areas. Special attention will be paid to the long-term problems, new challenges, \nand sectors offering new opportunities. Thus, the TA will (i) systematize the past experience and \nstudies into a coherent and integrated framework; (ii) update the economic assessment; (iii) \nsuggest  further  policy  directions  and  reforms;  and  (iv)  result  in  publication  of  a  new \ncomprehensive economic report, which will serve as a major reference document for all the \nstakeholders. \n \n ", "    3 \nC.        Cost and Financing  \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $360,000 equivalent, of which $235,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $125,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance an \namount  equivalent  to  $250,000,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $15,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the remaining cost of $110,000 equivalent to \ncover the local currency costs related to counterpart staff, office space for the consultants, and \nother local support. The cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.         Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The Ministry of Finance and National Planning will be the Executing Agency for the TA. \nADB will provide about 7.25 person-months of international consulting services, including a \nmacroeconomist,  a  private  sector  development  economist,  an  infrastructure  economist,  an \nagriculture  and  resource  economist,  and  a  social  sector  and  environment  specialist.  The \nmacroeconomist will be the team leader and provide intellectual leadership and guidance to the \nteam. The team leader will be responsible for the overall quality of the economic report. The \nGovernment will provide counterpart staff and office space within the Ministry of Finance and \nNational Planning, and other support and facilities. The counterpart staff will be actively involved \nin the technical review and analysis to ensure continuity of the Government\u2019s knowledge and \nskills in implementing the TA recommendations. \n \n13.  The  team  leader  will  undertake  the  macroeconomic  parts  of  the  report  and  be \nresponsible  for  overall  coordination  and  compilation  of  the  output  of  all  consultants,  and \npreparation of the PIER. The team leader will be engaged for about 2.5 person-months. The \nother three members of the team of consultants will be engaged for about 4\u20136 person-weeks \neach. They will be responsible for analyzing and preparing reports on sector and thematic \nareas. All the team members will start field work concurrently. Except for the team leader, all \nother consultants will complete most of their work in the field in one stretch and provide their \ndraft reports to the team leader. The team leader will finalize the report and assist in its \npublication. Other members of the team of consultants will assist the team leader to accomplish \nthese tasks. ADB will also engage an editor to assist the publication of the report. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  The TA will commence in January 2003 and be implemented over a period of about 12 \nmonths, with completion expected by January 2004. An international consulting firm will be \nengaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Further, the simplified technical proposal procedure will \napply.  Materials  and  equipment  for  the  TA  will  be  purchased  by  ADB  or  a  consultant,  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and arrangements acceptable to ADB. TA \nimplementation will be monitored and reviewed by ADB missions and regular communications \nwith the Ministry of Finance and National Planning and other concerned agencies. \n \n15.  The PIER\u2019s main audience will be government officials and staff of funding and aid \nagencies.  The  business  community,  academics,  students,  and  others  interested  in  the \ndevelopment of the Fiji Islands will also use the report. Prominent among these (including \nlibraries) will be sent complimentary copies of the PIER by mail.3 In addition, the PIER will be \n                                                 \n3 ADB\u2019s Pacific Department maintains a mailing list for such reports, which is updated periodically.
