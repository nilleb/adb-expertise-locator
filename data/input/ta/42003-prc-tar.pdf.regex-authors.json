The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is undertaking reforms to \nstrengthen public finances.  These  reforms  encompass a  number  of  areas  to  enhance  the \nefficiency and equity of the fiscal system and improve access to, and the quality of, public \nservices. To strengthen this effort, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to Support Fiscal Policy Reforms in High Priority \nSectors. A TA Fact-Finding Mission held detailed discussions in April 2008 with the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Health, \nthe National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and international agencies on \nobjectives and scope, implementation arrangements, and cost of the proposed TA project. This \nreport reflects ADB\u2019s findings and understandings reached with the Government on the TA \nproject  design,  costs,  and  its  implementation  arrangements.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The MOF sought ADB technical assistance to support fiscal reforms in three strategic \nareas:  (i)  fiscal  policy  support  for  the  health  sector  reforms  that  are  being  finalized;  (ii) \nassessment and management of the risks from the growing explicit, implicit, and contingent \nliabilities  of  subnational  governments;  and  (iii)  assessment  of  the  causes  of  escalation  of \nadministrative costs, and recommendations for containment measures.   \n \nA.  Fiscal Policy Support for the Health Sector Reforms \n \n3.  Improving people\u2019s health is one of the strategic priorities of the PRC under the 11th \nFive-Year Plan. The Government strategy seeks to provide equitable, efficient, and quality \npublic  health  and  basic  medical  services  for  all  citizens.  Total  health  care  expenditures \nrepresented 4.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006.2 Rapid increases in health care \ncosts have outpaced public expenditure for health, which declined as a share of total health \ncare spending from 36% in 1980 to 18% in 2006.3 Low levels of health insurance have led to a \nsharp increase in out-of-pocket expenses for individuals, which reached 50% of total national \nhealth expenditures in 2006, compared with 21% in 1980.4 Spiraling health costs coexist with \ngaps in quality of care and issues of equity and efficiency in the use of public resources, \nparticularly  in  rural  and  underdeveloped  areas.  Increasingly  concerned  about  these \ndevelopments (particularly declining access to affordable health services), the Government in \n2006 established an interministerial working group of 16 agencies chaired by the NDRC to \nprepare a comprehensive health reform framework. While the basic reform framework is being \nreadied  for  official  release,  more  detailed  plans  are  currently  being  drafted  by  the  core \nresponsible agencies. \n  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 April 2008. \n2  Unprecedented urbanization, rural reform and industrialization, rapid aging of the PRC's population, and the \nincrease in the incidence of noncommunicable diseases will all add to the demand for health care. Assuming \ncontinued growth of the PRC's economy at an average annual rate of 7%\u20138% and continued growth of the PRC's \ntotal health expenditure at an average annual rate of 12%, total health spending will reach 7% of GDP in 2010 (UN \nHealth Partners Group in China. 2005. A Health Situation Assessment of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Beijing). \n3  China National Health Economics Institute. 2007. China National Health Accounts. Beijing. \n4  China National Health Economics Institute. 2007. China National Health Accounts. Beijing. The share of out-of-\npocket health expenditures is even higher in poorer rural areas, where local government health care budgets are \nmost strained and where financial protection through health insurance is not adequate. \n ", "2   \n4.  The interministerial group has reportedly reached a broad consensus on the strategic \ndirections for strengthening health insurance and the public health system. Models for funding \ngrassroots health facilities (urban community health centers, village health clinics, and township \nhealth centers) have been discussed within the interministerial group. Two options were put \nforward. Under the first, the Government will take responsibility for medical staff salaries, and \nwill manage health facilities\u2019 operational expenditure and income separately. The second option \nis for a system funded from several sources (fiscal budget, health insurance, and out-of-pocket \nfunds), and the Government will set subsidies/support for medical institutions under a service-\npurchasing model. A decision is yet to be taken on this matter by the State Council. Options are \nalso discussed on provider payment mechanisms. These options will have different incentive \nstructures and are likely to impact differently on equity, efficiency, and quality of health services. \n \n5.  Given the potentially far-reaching fiscal and social impact of the alternative funding \noptions and provider payment mechanisms, the Government has requested the assistance of \nADB in pilot-testing various models for funding grassroots health facilities. The results of the \npilot test are expected to provide an empirical basis for determining optimal financing models for \nhealth facilities at the grassroots level to improve access to good quality, cost-effective, basic \nhealth care. Thus, the outcome of the pilot will help the Government decide the level and pattern \nof spending on grassroots health care facilities. The TA project builds on previous ADB support \nin the health sector to the PRC for:5 (i) research to help catalyze the Government\u2019s pilot testing \nof the new Rural Cooperative Medical System, (ii) establishing mechanisms for community \nparticipation to enhance system management and implementation at the grassroots level, (iii) \npublic nutrition and noncommunicable diseases, and (iv) ADB cooperation with the NDRC in \nassessing rural health services.   \n \nB.  Management of Subnational Government Liabilities  \n \n6.  The subnational governments are prohibited by law to borrow directly from the market. \nThey may only borrow from the central Government and external aid agencies as onlending \nfrom the central Government. Yet, in practice, subnational governments have been borrowing \nindirectly using various vehicles, including state-owned enterprises and other state agencies \nsuch  as  hospitals  and  educational  institutions.  The  magnitude  of  these  borrowings  is  not \ncaptured on budget. There is no institutional arrangement to account for and manage the risks \nfrom these liabilities, and hence their magnitude is not known. Keeping in mind the potential \nrisks of such unregulated borrowings, the Government set up a taskforce in the MOF in 2005 to \nmake recommendations for managing subnational liabilities. The responsibilities of the taskforce \nhave been given to the newly created Local Governments' Indebtedness Management Division \nin the MOF. This division will be responsible for consolidating, monitoring, and managing the \nindirectly created implicit liabilities of subnational governments.  \n \n7.  Even though subnational government liabilities are a growing concern, their magnitude is \nunknown  partly  due  to  the  complexities  involved  in  their  measurement.  A  blueprint  for \nestablishing a risk-rating and early warning system for continuous and accurate monitoring of \nlocal government indebtedness is yet to be prepared. The Government sought ADB technical \nassistance to support the work of the Local Governments' Indebtedness Management Division \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2000.

Knowledge  of  the  sources  and  magnitude  of  implicit \nliabilities of subnational governments and the use of a risk-rating and early warning system will \nhelp the Government to set specific targets for managing the level of implicit and explicit debt of \nsubnational governments. \n \nC.  Study and Management of Administrative Costs \n \n8.  The current level of administrative costs in the PRC is considered high for the PRC\u2019s \nlevel of development. Even so, these costs have been increasing in recent years; this is a \nsource of concern as well as criticism from both within and outside the Government. Preliminary \ninvestigations of the MOF pointed to three main contributing factors: (i) the modernization of \nstate assets, (ii) the introduction of new branches of Government, and (iii) increases in civil \nservant wages. In addition to the high level and growth of administrative costs, the Government \nis also concerned by their vertical and regional imbalances. While the central and provincial \ngovernments  have  high  administrative  costs  backed  up  by  corresponding  budgets,  local \ngovernments below provincial level find it difficult to obtain resources for effectively discharging \ntheir essential administrative functions. Further, there are regional imbalances amongst local \ngovernments, resulting in substantially lower administrative budgets for the western and central \nregions compared to the governments in the eastern region. The Government is keen to (i) \nstudy the causes of high administrative costs and their rapid growth, and the existing vertical \nand horizontal imbalances; and (ii) recommend measures and specific targets to contain costs \nand mitigate vertical and horizontal imbalances. In this regard, the Government intends to learn \nfrom relevant international experience.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  of  the  TA  project  is  increased  fiscal  effectiveness  and  equity  through \nimproved public resource management in key areas: health sector financing, risk from local \ngovernment  debt,  and  administrative  cost  containment.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  project  is \ndeepened fiscal reforms in key areas by (i) improving the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of \ngrassroots health care facilities; (ii) efficiently managing subnational government implicit and \nexplicit debt; and (iii) effectively containing the increase in administrative costs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA project will have three major outputs: (i) fiscal policy support for the health sector \nreforms, (ii) management of subnational government liabilities, and (iii) study and management \nof administrative costs.   \n \n11.  Fiscal Policy Support for the Health Sector Reforms (Output A). The health sector \ncomponent of the TA project will have the following three subcomponents:  \n \n(i)  Subcomponent  1:  Assistance  with  designing  the  pilot  project  and  the \naccompanying monitoring and evaluation system. The TA project will help \ndesign a pilot project to test cost-effective and equitable financing models for \nbasic health care and develop a monitoring and evaluation tool to track and \nevaluate the performance of the pilot. The monitoring and evaluation tool will be \n ", "4   \ndeveloped as a \u201cpre-post experiment with an appropriate control group\u201d.6 The \nfinancing models to be tested will be finalized after the State Council\u2019s decision \non the piloting arrangements. This subcomponent will also develop a quality \nassessment tool to monitor the quality of the implementation of the pilot project.  \n(ii)  Subcomponent 2: Monitoring and evaluation of the pilot project. Based on \nthe  outputs  of  subcomponent  1,  the  TA  project  will  carry  out  independent \nmonitoring and evaluation of the pilot project, including the initial provision of \nbasic training to concerned local health and administrative staff for the proper \nimplementation of the pilot project and the monitoring and evaluation system. \nThe implementation of the pilot project will be the responsibility of the central and \nconcerned local governments. Monitoring will be carried out over two budget \ncycles with a midterm evaluation after the first year and final evaluation at the \nend of the project. \n(iii)  Subcomponent 3: Policy recommendations for reforming the financing of \ngrassroots health facilities. Based on the evaluation reports, the TA project will \ndevelop policy recommendations for central and local governments. The policy \nrecommendations  will  be  discussed  by  stakeholders  and  presented  to  the \nGovernment. \n \n12.  The total duration of this component will be 30 months. An outline of terms of reference \nfor the consultants and the estimated need for consulting inputs are in Appendix 3. \n \n13.  Management of Subnational Government Liabilities (Output B).This output will have \nfive objectives: (i) introduce the best international practices for measuring the explicit, implicit, \nand  contingent  liabilities  incurred  by  the  agencies  controlled  by  provincial  and  local \ngovernments; (ii) estimate the magnitude of subnational government liabilities; (iii) prepare a \nblueprint for establishing a risk-rating and early warning system of international standard for \ncontinuous and accurate monitoring of local government indebtedness; (iv) study the feasibility \nof issuance of securities in the market by subnational governments; and (v) organize workshops \nto discuss policy issues on local-debt management. The magnitude of subnational liabilities \nunder item (ii) will be estimated using representative samples from one province from each of \nthe six regions in the PRC. Due to the sensitivities in the disclosure of subnational government \nliabilities, the Government preferred single-source selection of the College of Finance and \nTaxation  of  the  People\u2019s  University,  also  known  as  the  China  Fiscal  and  Financial  Policy \nResearch Center.7 In addition, resource persons will be engaged for the international seminar. \nThis output is expected to be completed in 18 months. \n \n14.  Study and Management of Administrative Costs (Output C). This component will (i) \nassess the causes of the high administrative costs and their rapid growth in recent years; (ii) \nexamine the reasons for vertical and horizontal imbalances at the subnational level; and (iii) \nrecommend  mitigating  measures,  incentives,  and  institutional  arrangements  necessary  for \ncontaining administrative costs and reducing imbalances. The Government will take note of \ninternational  best  practices  in  this  field,  including  the  use  of  e-governance  solutions.  The \nGovernment also intends to estimate off-budget administrative expenditure on a pilot basis to \ngauge the true magnitude of the problem and learn about hidden sources of cost escalation. \nThe  outputs  will  include  (i)  a  research  framework,  incorporating  relevant  international \nexperience, for fieldwork to estimate administrative costs including from off-budget sources (on \n                                                 \n6   A standard quasi-experimental design used to test the impact of an intervention. \n7  The institution has (i) the capacity to carry out the task, (ii) a good reputation and track record in providing research \nservices in the field of public finance, and (iii) independent management. \n ", "  5\na sample basis); (ii) a multi-stakeholder workshop to validate the research framework; (iii) a \ndraft final research report, including structural and trend analysis of administrative costs at the \nmacro, provincial, and regional levels, and policy recommendations; (iv) an international study \ntour for selected government officials (possibly to the United Kingdom and Denmark); (v) an \ninternational seminar where the draft final research report will be discussed in light of relevant \nexperience from selected developing and developed nations; and (vi) a final research report, \nincluding policy recommendations that reflect international best practices. In addition, use will be \nmade of international resource persons, who will be asked to provide inputs at the international \nseminar. This output is expected to be completed in 18 months. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA project is estimated at $1,300,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA project will be financed on a grant \nbasis  from  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  funding  program.  The  Government  will  provide  the \nremaining $300,000 of local currency costs in kind, to cover office accommodation, counterpart \nstaff, and other related services. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The International Department of the MOF will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA \nproject.8 The Department of Social Security of the MOF will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for \noutput A. An interministerial pilot review group under MOF will oversee output A. The group will \nprovide  strategic  orientation  to  the  TA  project  and  feedback  on  its  outputs.  The  Budget \nDepartment  of  the  MOF  will  be  the  IA  for  output  B.  The  Department  of  Administrative, \nLegislative, and Judicial Agencies of the MOF will be the IA for output C. The International \nDepartment of the MOF, as the EA, in consultation with the IAs, will supervise the day-to-day \nworking of the consultants and take responsibility for administering national training programs, \nseminars,  workshops,  and  in-country  study  visits.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  these \ncomponents, ADB may establish an advance payment facility for the EA as needed, and/or \nutilize direct payment.9 ADB will assist the EA in facilitating the international study tours. The \nCollege of Finance and Taxation of the People\u2019s University will be engaged on single-source \nselection basis due to the confidential nature of the study for output B; remaining consultants \nwill be selected on competitive basis. All consultants for the TA project will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Supporting Fiscal Reforms in High Priority \nSectors, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  Work on the TA project is expected to commence in July 2008 and end in July 2011. \n9 The EA has adequate capacity to manage the advance and liquidation process. However, at the time of TA project \ninception, ADB will provide orientation to the EA on relevant procedures to be followed to use the facility. This \nfacility will be established in line with ADB's technical assistance disbursement handbook (ADB. 2008. Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.
