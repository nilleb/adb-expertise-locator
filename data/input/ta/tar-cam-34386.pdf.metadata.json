To provide the Prime Minister with a dedicated resource for \nsocioeconomic strategy and policy development and advice, the Supreme National Economic \nCouncil (SNEC) was created by Sub-decree in January 1999.1  According to its mandate, \u201cthe \nSNEC is the highest-level body mandated to provide the Prime Minister with technical analysis, \nadvice, and recommendations with regard to policy and strategy for the rapid yet sustainable \nsocioeconomic development of Cambodia\u201d. Following the successful implementation of ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA) for institutional support to SNEC,2 the Government requested ADB for \nfurther TA to strengthen the institutional capacity of SNEC for national policy analysis and \ndevelopment management.3  A fact-finding mission in October 2004 and a follow-up mission in \nMarch 2005 reached understanding with the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financial arrangements, and consulting services for the TA.  \nA design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Cambodia is at a crossroads in its development as it moves away from a post-conflict \nsituation towards a more normal development paradigm. More than two decades of international \nisolation and conflict that ended in 1991, with the signing of the Paris Peace Agreements, \ndevastated much of the Country\u2019s physical, social, and human capital, forcing Cambodia to start \nfrom scratch in rebuilding its infrastructure and institutions. Although important economic and \nsocial gains have been made over the past decade, the development agenda remains daunting. \nPoverty remains widespread and intense\u2015with 35%\u201340% of the population remaining below \nthe poverty line\u2015and inequality appears to be increasing. Recent relatively robust growth has \nnot led to a significant reduction in poverty, and achieving many of Cambodia\u2019s Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) will be difficult. \n \n3.  With peace and macroeconomic stability now more firmly entrenched, the country has \nthe opportunity to make far-reaching reforms to achieve sustained socioeconomic development.  \nHowever, this can only take place if key strategies, policies, and legislation are effectively \nformulated,  coordinated,  and  implemented.  Limited  Government  capacity  to  manage  this \nprocess constrains the speed and sustainability of the reform program. The limitations in policy \nanalysis, coordination, and implementation are particularly evident in economic management. \n \n4.  Although key economic ministers provide advice and inputs on socioeconomic strategy \nand policy to the Prime Minister, their capacity to provide this on a sustained basis is limited, as \nthey simultaneously attend to their respective ministries and departments and engage in a \nbroad  array  of  interministerial,  sectoral,  regional,  and  international  responsibilities.  The \nestablishment of SNEC is, therefore, an important initiative for strengthening domestic policy \nformulation and monitoring at the national level.  By being able to stand back from day-to-day \nwork and the political pressures of regular Government ministries, SNEC can take a more \nindependent  view  and  provide  the  Prime  Minister  with  more  rigorous,  objective  advice  on \nsocioeconomic development issues.   \n                                                 \n1  As currently constituted, the SNEC is composed of a chairperson, five senior economic advisors (members), a \nsecretary general, and technical staff. The chairperson has been given the rank of minister and the secretary \ngeneral, the rank of secretary of state.  The secretary general heads the SNEC Secretariat. \n2 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Cambodia for Institutional Support for National Economic Policy Management. \nManila (TA 3721-CAM).  The technical assistance completion report was completed on 19 November 2004. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 August 2004. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  TA 3721-CAM: Institutional Support for National Economic Policy Management was \ndesigned to strengthen the capacity of the Government, particularly SNEC, in policy analysis \nand development management. The objectives of the TA were to (i) enable SNEC to perform its \nrole in a responsive, professional, and timely manner; and (ii) provide training to the technical \nstaff of the SNEC Secretariat. The TA was highly successful in providing wide-ranging outputs \nto the Prime Minister on a needs basis. The training of staff by means of 24 policy analysis \nclinics  was  also  considered  relevant.  The  TA  also  prepared  SNEC  2010,  the  Institutional \nDevelopment Plan (IDP) of SNEC, to establish an institution able to serve on a continuous and \nsustainable basis and fulfill its mandate. However, the need to respond quickly and flexibly to \nevents meant that the work agenda was to some extent driven by short-term objectives and \nthere  was  insufficient  focus  on  the  need  for  longer-term  policy  analysis,  formulation,  and \nmonitoring of development impacts. Such capability is even more necessary now, given the \nurgent need to implement the development vision set out in the Government\u2019s Rectangular \nStrategy, by preparing a single planning document, the National Strategic Development Plan \n(NSDP) 2006\u20132010, which will follow the existing Second Socio-Economic Development Plan \n2001\u20132005 and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy 2003\u20132005.4 \n \n6.  The Government sees the strengthening of SNEC as a matter of high priority and is \ncommitted to its future role. Given the level of support it enjoys within Government, SNEC has \nan important catalytic role to play in refining, implementing, and monitoring the reform program.  \nFurther development of SNEC\u2019s institutional capacity will strengthen the Government\u2019s ability to \ncoordinate policy inputs, formulate appropriate policies, make rational choices among identified \npolicy options, and monitor their implementation more effectively. \n \n7.  TA 3721 was a cost-effective and strategic intervention that has made a start in building \ncapacity in SNEC for policy analysis and advice. The gains made will form the basis for further \ntechnical assistance to strengthen the capacity for policy analysis, formulation, and advice, and \nmonitoring of development impacts. Based on lessons learned from TA 3721, and the need to \nensure sustainable outcomes, future ADB assistance will focus on achieving a more clearly \ndefined set of outputs consistent with the programs and activities in IDP. Towards this end, the \ntraining to be provided will build on and complement that already provided under TA 3721 to \nbetter equip the technical staff of SNEC with the means to solve problems and undertake the \nsubstantive  analytical  work  required  to  achieve  the  outputs  identified  in  this  TA.  The \ninternational consultant will consequently play more of an advisory and supervisory and / or \nmentoring role during this TA. To facilitate access to information and data and to help staff work \non an ongoing and sustainable basis, the TA will also assist in developing a resource center for \nSNEC by providing computers and other IT-related equipment. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA aims to improve the quality, speed, and sustainability of the economic reform \nprocess in Cambodia by helping to improve Government capacity to coordinate, formulate, and \nmonitor the implementation of national economic policies.  Towards this end, the TA will further \nstrengthen the capacity of SNEC for national policy analysis and development management.  \n                                                 \n4  The Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency was prepared by the SNEC in 2004 and \nis intended to guide implementation of the Government\u2019s economic agenda during its current mandate.  Although it \nsets out a lucid and coherent vision for development, it lacks an action plan and needs prioritization, costing, and \nlinkage to the national budget and Medium-Term Expenditure Framework.   \n ", "  3\nThe major outputs expected of the TA are: (i) policy briefs, periodic economic assessments, and \nmore  detailed  analytical  reports  on  topics  of  relevance  to  the  Prime  Minister;  (ii)  periodic \nrevisions to the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to make it more comprehensive; \n(iii) inputs to the preparation of the Government\u2019s new five-year planning document, the National \nStrategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2006\u20132010, to ensure consistency with other government \npolicies and reforms, and to ensure that prioritized action plans in the NSDP are costed and \nlinked to the budget and MTEF; (iv) annual NSDP progress reports; (v) in-depth policy research \nreports, and a half-yearly economic report for public dissemination;5 and (vi) better-trained \ntechnical  staff  of  SNEC,  capable  of  problem  solving  and  undertaking  analysis  in \nmacroeconomics, and in the areas of responsibility of the members of SNEC (e.g., international \ndevelopment  finance,  agricultural  development,  infrastructure,  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration, international trade, fiscal management, and international relations). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  All the outputs are designed to directly or indirectly increase the capacity of SNEC for \nnational policy analysis and development management. Crucial to strengthening the institutional \ncapacity of SNEC for policy analysis and advice is the availability of a core staff with the \nrequisite  skills  and  competencies.  By  orienting  the  training  towards  problem  solving  and \nproducing high-quality outputs, SNEC will be in a better position to perform its role in a more \nresponsive, professional, and timely manner. By developing the capacity of the staff to produce \nregular  and  high-quality  policy  briefs,  periodic  economic  assessments,  and  more  detailed \nanalytical reports, SNEC will be better positioned to provide the Prime Minister with timely \nanalysis and advice on policy issues, policy alternatives, and developments in the Cambodian \nand global economy. Developing a more comprehensive MTEF driven by transparent policy-\nrelated fiscal parameters is integral to Cambodia\u2019s development efforts, and key to effective and \nefficient use of resources to attain the desired growth and poverty reduction targets of the \nNSDP.  The  annual  progress  reports  of  the  NSDP  are  essential  to  monitor  progress  in \nimplementing the reforms and achieving NSDP targets, and in providing feedback to planners \nand  policy makers  to make  necessary  mid  course  corrections.  Given  the  dearth  of  public \ninformation and discussion on socioeconomic issues relating to Cambodia\u2019s development, the \npublication of the research outputs of SNEC and the periodic assessments of the Cambodian \neconomy is aimed at promoting greater awareness and public participation in the development \nprocess.   \n \n10.  The key activities of the TA to achieve the outputs are:  \n \n(i)  upgrading the expertise of the technical staff of SNEC by providing on-the-job \ntraining with an emphasis on problem solving and providing refresher courses \n(on a need basis) in macroeconomics and the areas of responsibility of SNEC \nmembers; \n \n(ii)   helping develop a resource center for SNEC to enhance access to information \nand  data  by  providing  computers  and  other  IT-related  equipment  to  enable \nnetworking; \n \n(iii)  undertaking research and other analytical studies; \n                                                 \n5  The policy research agenda will be developed by the international economic policy advisor in close collaboration \nwith the secretary general of SNEC, and SNEC members.  It is envisaged that two to three such reports will be \nproduced each year. \n ", "4   \n \n(iv)  arranging  national  and  international  workshops  and  seminars  on  topics  of \nsocioeconomic  relevance  to  Cambodia  and  SNEC,  including  discussion  of \npreliminary findings of SNEC\u2019s research to encourage stakeholder participation in \nthe  development  process  and  facilitate  exposure  to  best  practices  and \nknowledge; and \n \n(v)  disseminating  the  research  findings  and  periodic  economic  assessments  of  \nSNEC through the publication of reports, where deemed appropriate. \n \n11.  The TA is based on the assumption that the Prime Minister will continue to involve \nSNEC in all relevant policy issues and ensure that it has access to necessary information. It \nalso assumes that the Government will use the policy and economic analysis from SNEC and \nthe progress reports on NSDP implementation to formulate policy and make needed revisions \nand/or mid course corrections to its reform program. There is also the implicit assumption that \nthe topics covered in SNEC publications are of general interest and relevance. Against this, \nthere is a risk that other organizations involved in policy formulation and implementation do not \nextend full cooperation to SNEC, thus hindering its effectiveness. There is also risk of a loss \nand/or redeployment of trained officers from SNEC, weakening its capacity to fulfill its mandate. \nFinally, the publications of SNEC may fail to attract much public interest due to lack of relevance \nof the topics covered and poor quality analysis. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $254,000 and a local currency cost of $371,000 equivalent.  ADB will finance \n$500,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $246,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  \nThe Government will finance $125,000 equivalent for office accommodation and transport, \nremuneration,  and  per  diem  of  counterpart  staff,  and  other  items  such  as  utilities,  local \ncommunications,  and  conference  and  workshop  venues.    A  schedule  of  the  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will support  (i) one economic policy adviser (international consultant) providing 6 \nperson-months of services, performed intermittently in six visits over 24 months, and up to 80 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services,  including  those  of  an  IT  specialist,  on  an \nintermittent  basis.  It  is  envisaged  that  two  long-term  consultants,  both  macroeconomics \nspecialists, will be recruited for 20 person-months each. The short-term consultants, who are \nexpected to be sector specialists, will be recruited on a need basis. \n \n14.  The terms of reference (TOR) for the consulting services required are presented in \nAppendix 3. The international consultant and domestic consultants will be recruited on an \nindividual basis, the latter from among Cambodian nationals. All consultants will be recruited in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.   \n \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be SNEC, with its chairperson serving as the \nprincipal  coordinator.  SNEC  will  provide  office  space  for  the  international  and  domestic \n ", "  5\nconsultants, including basic furnishings and support staff. The SNEC secretary general will act \nas the full-time counterpart staff of the international consultant.  \n \n16.  The economic policy adviser (international consultant) will submit to ADB an inception \nreport 1 month after the start of field services; half-yearly progress reports, a midterm report \nafter 12 months of implementation; a draft final, and final report at the conclusion of the TA.  The \ninception report will include (i) a detailed work plan for the international consultant and expected \noutputs; (ii) detailed TORs for the two long-term domestic consultants, and the short-term \nconsultants needed during the first year; and (iii) agreed upon indicators to monitor progress in \nachieving  the  expected  TA  outputs.  The  domestic  IT  specialist  will  be  responsible  for  the \nprocurement of computers, a server, network components and related accessories, internet \nfacilities,  and  customized  software  to  enable  SNEC  staff  to  fulfill  their  work  program  (all \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement). \n \n17.  The TA is expected to be implemented over 2 years, beginning June 2005 and closing \nMay 2007.   \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.
