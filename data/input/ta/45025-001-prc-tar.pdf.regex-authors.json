INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission in December 2010, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  improving  energy  efficiency  and  reducing  emissions  through \nintelligent railway station buildings (IRSBs). A fact-finding mission visited the PRC in August \n2011 and reached agreement with the government on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC has sustained high levels of economic growth since the open door policy and \neconomic reforms were initiated. Gross domestic product increased from $268.3 billion in 1978 \nto $5,878.6 billion in 2010, with an annual growth rate of 10.1%. With rapid industrialization and \nurbanization, however, energy consumption and carbon emissions have increased at a great \npace. The PRC has replaced the United States as the largest carbon emitter since 2007 and \nbecome the world\u2019s largest energy consumer since 2010. Growing energy consumption and \nemissions raise serious concerns. The International Energy Agency predicts that world primary \nenergy demand will increase by 36% between 2008 and 2035. The PRC\u2019s demand will rise by \n75%, accounting for 36% of the projected growth in global energy use.2 In order to manage the \ngrowth in energy demand, the government has planned to reduce energy consumption and \ncarbon dioxide emissions by 16% and 17% respectively for each unit of gross domestic product \nduring the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011\u20132015). \n \n3.  Railways play an important role in transportation in the PRC due to the country\u2019s large \nland area and population. The government has been increasing the railway transport capacity to \nmeet the needs of economic and social development. During 1980\u20132010, the railway network \nincreased from 53,321 kilometers (km) to 91,000 km, an average annual increase of 1.8%. Over \nthe same period, however, railway passenger traffic increased from 138.3 billion passenger-km \nto 876.2 billion passenger-km, an annual growth rate of 6.35%. Meanwhile, railway freight traffic \ngrew  from  571.8 billion  ton-km  to  2,764.4  billion  ton-km,  an  annual  rate  of  5.39%.  The \ngovernment recognizes that railways offer an environmentally friendly mode of transport while \nproviding an important way to spur economic growth, generate employment opportunities, and \nreduce  poverty.  It  plans  to  sustain  railway  development  through  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan, \nparticularly by developing railways in poorer and undeveloped provinces that will contribute to \neconomic growth and reduce poverty and improve livelihoods for people served by new railways \nby  ensuring  cost-effective  and  fast  access  to  markets,  educational,  and  health  facilities; \ngenerating employment opportunities during construction and operation; and improving social \nservices. The plan envisages (i) removing transport bottlenecks and enhancing railway transport \ncapacity; (ii) increasing railway operating mileage to 120,000 km, including 50,000 km in the \nless-developed western region; (iii) optimizing the structure of the railway network while making \n50% of the network\u2019s length double-track and 60% of it electrified; (iv) increasing passenger and \nfreight volumes to 3 billion persons and 4.8 billion tons, which will be 78.6% and 32.2% greater \nthan  in  2010,  respectively;  and  (v)  constructing  and  reconstructing  about  1,000  railway \npassenger stations. \n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s railway is a growing energy end-user. Between 2000 and 2010, its electricity \nconsumption grew by 181.4% from 12.64 billion to 35.57 billion kilowatt-hours (annual growth of \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 November 2011. \n2  International Energy Agency. 2010. World Energy Outlook 2010. Paris. \n ", "2  \n10.9%).3 With rapid increases in traffic volume and a rising share of electrified railways, railway \nelectricity  consumption  will  continue  to  grow  in  future.  PRC  railways  will  consume  around \n59.7 billion  kilowatt-hours  in  2015,  an  increase  of  68%  compared  with  2010.  In  order  to \nmoderate the increasing energy use, the Ministry of Railways (MOR) has committed to improve \nenergy efficiency. It achieved its mandatory target to reduce the average energy use per unit of \ntraffic volume (railway energy intensity) by 20% during the 11th Five-Year Plan period and has \nset a new target to further reduce it by 10% during the 12th Five-Year Plan. \n \n5.  Railway stations are a core component of the railway network and critical to its effective \noperation. MOR has around 5,300 railway stations, including 1,624 railway passenger stations. \nThey are often busy and crowded, with billions of passengers gathering and dispatching on \ntrains annually. Most stations were designed and constructed long ago following conventional \ntechnical  standards  and  methods  without  much  consideration  for  energy  efficiency  and \nenvironmental protection. Even newly built railway stations that generally were designed for \nimproved aesthetics, functionality, and connection with other transport modes were designed \nwithout  adequate  attention  to  energy  efficiency  and  integration  of  both  railway  operating \nsubsystems and station building subsystems. \n \n6.  Around 40% of the world\u2019s energy is consumed by buildings. Since the 1980s, intelligent \nbuildings technology has been developed to integrate energy efficiency and environmental \nfriendliness into building design. Without sacrificing comfort, such technology can result in \nenergy savings of 25%\u221230% and corresponding carbon emission reductions.4 It has made \nsignificant  inroads  into  improving  energy  consumption  in  public  and  residential  buildings, \nparticularly in developed countries. IRSBs using intelligent building technology can therefore \ncontribute to MOR meeting its energy intensity reduction target. \n \n7.  MOR has made efforts to improve energy efficiency in railway stations by updating \nelectrical equipment and lighting and air-conditioning systems. However, these improvements \nwould be insufficient to achieve the plan\u2019s targets. MOR believes it is necessary to introduce an \nIRSB  concept  that  integrates  the  latest  thinking  and  technologies  in  building  design, \nenvironmental preservation, energy savings, and operating efficiency. This concept would lead \nto a new technical design standard for railway station construction and operations. By adopting \nIRSBs, MOR wishes to (i) reduce energy use without compromising traffic growth and comfort, \n(ii) reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (iii) improve service quality and safety, and (iv) decrease \noperating costs. \n \n8.  Through policy dialogue, ADB has been supporting the PRC\u2019s efforts to develop a \nsustainable, intelligent, and environment-friendly railway system with high quality services and \nefficiency. In Strategy 20205 and the Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan,6 ADB \nhas identified railways as a core operational subsector and achieving sustainability, energy \nefficiency, and emissions reduction as a strategic priority. In its support for PRC railways, ADB \n                                                 \n3  Over the period, electrified railway operating mileage increased from 14,864 km to 42,000 km. \n4  Continental Automated Buildings Association (CABA). 2009.

It will help MOR \nachieve its new targets of energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the \n12th Five-Year Plan through using IRSBs.8 The TA will also contribute to developing sustainable, \nintelligent, and environment-friendly railways in the PRC. Additionally, it will explore the potential \nfor developing an IRSB demonstration project that could be suitable for ADB financing in the \nPRC, with scope for replication within the PRC and in other developing member countries. \n \n9.  IRSB is a new concept for MOR, and developing IRSBs will be a challenge as MOR has \nlittle experience and relevant knowledge. Energy efficiency and emissions reduction are urgent \nrequirements for inclusive growth and sustainable railway development, and these have been \nincluded in the government\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan as mandated targets. Hence, through the TA, \nthe government seeks ADB\u2019s assistance to research and learn from international best practices \non IRSB and adapt them for use in PRC railways. The TA will complement ADB\u2019s ongoing \nefforts to assist the PRC in developing a sustainable, intelligent, and environmentally friendly \nrailway system with high quality services and efficiency. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be a more energy-efficient, environment-friendly, and intelligent \nrailway system developed in the PRC. The achievement of this impact will be demonstrated by \nimproved energy efficiency and reduced emissions through IRSBs. The outcome of the TA will \nbe that recommendations for IRSB development, railway station energy efficiency assessment \nmethodologies, and action plans for applying IRSBs are endorsed by MOR to enhance energy \nefficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the railway sector. As a result of the TA, it is \nexpected that MOR will adopt relevant policy recommendations on IRSBs and take actions to \ndevelop IRSBs in the PRC by applying intelligent building technologies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  TA  will  (i)  provide  recommendations  for  IRSB \ndevelopment in the PRC, (ii) develop an energy efficiency and emissions assessment method \nfor railway stations, and (iii) prepare an action plan and a policy brief. \n \n12.  The main activities of the TA will be to (i) review the current national building standards \nfor energy conservation and the current practices for energy efficiency and emissions in the \nPRC railway stations; (ii) build a database of best international practices applicable for IRSBs, \ncovering  (a)  technologies  and  systems,  (b)  design  concepts  and  criteria,  (c) operational \nmanagement methods, (d) strategic management, and (e) ranking practices including according \nto  efficiency,  cost,  and  difficulty  of  implementation;  (iii)  recommend  IRSB  technologies, \nmanagement,  and  practices  to  MOR  with  a  view  to  having  these  approved,  piloted,  and \n                                                 \n7  For example, ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Managing Railway Passenger \nOperations More Efficiently. Manila (TA 4864-PRC). This TA helped the PRC railways to conduct research on  \ninternational experiences of improving efficiency and safety in dedicated passenger operations and how these can \nbe adapted for use in the PRC railways. The TA has been completed and the completion report rated it successful. \n8  According to preliminary estimates, if 330 large stations among MOR\u2019s total of 1,015 railway passenger stations \nare constructed or reconstructed during the 12th Five-Year Plan using intelligent building technology, this will \nreduce energy consumption by more than 2 billion kilowatt-hours annually, equivalent to avoiding the need for a \nlarge coal-based power plant thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 1.5 million tons, sulfur \ndioxide emissions by 33,000\u201350,000 tons, and nitrogen oxide emissions by 17,000\u201325,000 tons. \n ", "4  \nmainstreamed; (iv) establish detailed energy efficiency and emissions indicators to monitor and \nassess  the  energy  efficiency  and  emissions  reduction  of  MOR\u2019s  railways;  (v)  propose  an \nassessment  method  leading  to  recommendations  for  applications  of  the  aforesaid \nrecommended issues through adopting best practices that can be used in the PRC; (vi) prepare \nan action plan with a brief strategy note for applying IRSBs in MOR covering technology, policy, \nmanagement, staff training needs, and recommendation of an IRSB demonstration project that \ncan be supported by ADB and potentially be replicated in the PRC and other developing \nmember countries; and (vii) prepare a policy brief highlighting the main findings of the TA and \nmaking the case for the recommended changes. The TA will also provide capacity building \nsupport through an international study tour for MOR officials to visit best practices of IRSBs and \nother intelligent buildings and through domestic training and knowledge sharing. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  involve  research,  fieldwork,  training,  stakeholder  consultations,  and \nknowledge transfer. The TA will include two workshops, at inception and interim report stages, \nto discuss and review the TA findings. A seminar will be arranged at the final report stage to \ndisseminate the international best practices and TA findings. The TA will be undertaken in close \nconsultation  with  relevant  departments  in  MOR,  the  government,  user  groups,  the  private \nsector,  international  development  partners,  and  other  relevant  agencies.  It  will  take  into \nconsideration  previous  studies  carried  out  by  the  government,  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  the \nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development, other multilateral agencies, and \nbilateral agencies. MOR will provide the consultants with all relevant materials, recent studies, \nand reports required for the TA, and will also assist in arranging the workshops and seminar and \nliaising with government agencies concerned and with other stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The government has requested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) to \ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency cost. The government \nwill provide counterpart staff, office space with furniture, utilities and telecommunication access, \nlocal transport, and other services to finance the total costs such as remuneration of counterpart \nstaff and services. (See Appendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and financing plan.) \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOR will be the executing agency for the TA and be responsible for supervising and \nmonitoring TA activities. A leading group comprising representatives of relevant departments of \nMOR will be established to oversee implementation and provide guidance to the consultants. A \nproject  coordinator  will  be  assigned  to  supervise  and  coordinate  day-to-day  TA  activities, \nincluding to monitor progress, resolve problems, arrange meetings, and liaise with the relevant \ndepartments  in  MOR  and  other  agencies  concerned.  MOR  will  also  provide  sufficient \ncounterpart staff with relevant work experience during TA implementation. \n \n16.  A team of international and national consultants will be engaged by ADB through a \nconsulting firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method with 90% weight given to \nquality and 10% to cost of services, and using simplified technical proposal procedures in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The international and national consultants will have expertise and experience in intelligent \nbuildings,  railway  buildings,  railway  electrical  systems,  railway  operation,  railway  energy \nefficiency, and IRSB development. The 90:10 weighting is appropriate because (i) the TA \ncomprises an advanced assignment requiring a high degree of expertise in using intelligent \nbuilding technology to reduce energy use, and (ii) the TA is likely to have a significant impact on \n ", "  5\nfuture development of energy efficient and environment-friendly railway systems in the PRC. \nTwo international consultants will provide a total of 8 person-months of services, and up to 5 \nnational consultants will render a total of 16 person-months of services. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). An advance payment facility \ncan be used to conduct training seminars and conferences. Any procurement under this TA will \nbe conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \n \n18.  TA implementation is expected to begin in April 2012 and be completed by September \n2012. The consultants will submit the following reports to MOR and ADB: (i) an inception report \n3 weeks after commencement of services, (ii) an interim report 12 weeks after commencement \nof services, (iii) a draft final report after 18 weeks, and (iv) a final report 2 weeks after receipt of \nreview comments from the executing agency and ADB. The final report will include but not be \nlimited to (i) a study report and recommendations for IRSB development in the PRC; (ii) the \naction plans for IRSB development in the PRC; (iii) an IRSB demonstration project that can be \nsupported by ADB; (iv) a policy note summarizing the best practices, findings, and outcome of \nthe TA; and (v) an executive summary of key activities, findings, and recommendations not \nexceeding five pages. All reports shall be submitted in English. \n \n19.  Major project activities will be regularly monitored by and reported to ADB administration \nmissions  and  MOR.  Consultants  will  present  their  findings  at  workshops  and  seminars \norganized to validate and disseminate their findings, and reports will be made available on \nADB\u2019s website in English and Chinese. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Improving  Energy  Efficiency  and \nReducing Emissions through Intelligent Railway Station Buildings, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets     \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact       \nA more energy efficient,  Energy consumption in  Government and Ministry  Assumptions \nenvironment-friendly,  PRC railways per unit  of Railways (MOR)  The recommendations will \nand intelligent railway  of traffic reduced by  statistics  include the related railway \nsystem developed in  10% from 2010 to 2015    development plan and \nthe People\u2019s Republic    technical documents. \nof China (PRC)  Unit discharge of major   \n  pollutants by PRC  The government is \nrailways reduced by  committed to constructing \n10% from 2010 to 2015  intelligent railway station \n  buildings (IRSBs). \nPassengers traffic   \nvolume increases by  The action plans for IRSBs \n78% in 2015 from  will be fully implemented by \n1.68 billion persons in  the government and MOR. \n2010   \n   \nFreight traffic volume \nincreases by 32% in \n2015 from 3.6 billion \ntons in 2010 \n \nOutcome       \nPolicy  MOR adopts the action  Technical assistance (TA)  Assumptions \nrecommendations for  plan, recommendations,  completion report from  The government accepts \nIRSB development, a  and assessment  Asian Development Bank  recommendations and action \nmethod for assessing  method by 2013.
