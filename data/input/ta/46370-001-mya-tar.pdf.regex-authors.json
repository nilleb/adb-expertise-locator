INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) to the Government of \nMyanmar will help the Ministry of Construction (MOC)1 develop an asset management and \ncapacity development program to meet an immediate need to maintain  the country\u2019s road \nassets,2 particularly on core primary and secondary networks. During a reconnaissance mission \nto Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar 23\u201325 October 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) discussed \nroad  asset  management  issues  with  government  officials.  Agreement was  reached  on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference of the TA. Details are in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).3 \n \n2.  The TA will support ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Myanmar for 2012\u2013\n2014, which made transport a priority sector for ADB assistance and highlighted the need for \nimproved access and connectivity.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Transport will be a key part in the fundamental political, economic, and social change \nthat Myanmar is poised to undergo. \n \n4.  Based on the country's size, population, and potential, Myanmar\u2019s transport sector is \nsignificantly less developed than those of its neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations.  Average  road  density  across  all  association  member  countries  totals  about  11 \nkilometers (km) per 1,000 people. Myanmar has only about 2 km for every 1,000 people, and \nmuch of this road is in poor condition. This makes the improvement of domestic connectivity by \nproviding more efficient transport links between rural areas, markets, and urban centers a \ndevelopment priority. \n \n5.  Myanmar currently lacks the institutional and technical capacity to plan and carry out the \nrequired reform and development of the transport system. The transport sector has no overall \nstrategy. Its institutional structure is fragmented, its management practices are centralized, and \nits investment and asset maintenance programs are poorly conceived. Plans at the subsector \nlevel  are  simple  lists  of  construction  and  maintenance  projects  with  limited  attention  to \nprioritization or evaluation. Subsector plans are not coordinated with either one another or the \ncountry\u2019s overall development plan, which includes only a broadly expressed intention to extend \ntransport links to all parts of the country to support national integration. \n \n6.  Investment in the transport sector since the 1990s has mainly come from government \nfunds and tended to focus on major highways and railways. Comparatively little spending has \ngone  into  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  existing  transport  network.  Chronic \nunderinvestment, notably in the secondary and tertiary road network, has left large parts of the \ncountry without adequate or reliable transport connections and with poor access to markets and \n                                                \n1  MOC is responsible for less than 20% of Myanmar\u2019s road network but these roads carry most of the country\u2019s long-\ndistance heavy traffic. By concentrating on MOC and its part of the network, the TA will provide maximum early \neconomic and social returns and be implemented in a relatively simple institutional environment where it can \nbenefit from a well-skilled management team. \n2  These assets comprise all MOC-owned assets within a road corridor, including the road\u2019s pavement, drainage \nstructures, and such road furniture as signage and lighting, traffic control, and warning devices. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 February 2013. \n4  ADB. 2012.

This has severely constrained economic growth and social development in \nthe more remote and border regions of Myanmar. \n \n7.  Expansion of the road system (particularly the secondary and tertiary networks) is clearly \nimportant for the country\u2019s economic development, but the more immediate critical need is to \nmaintain the existing core roads so that they accommodate the rapid increase in traffic that an \nexpected acceleration in economic activity that is expected to result from new broad economic \nreforms. The TA will help address the conditions created by longstanding underinvestment in \nthe management and maintenance of the part of the country\u2019s road assets that are managed by \nMOC.  It  will  upgrade  the  ministry\u2019s  operational  efficiency  through  capacity  development \nprograms. This will improve transport connectivity and service reliability on important stretches \nof Myanmar\u2019s road system, which in turn will stimulate inclusive economic growth. ADB will \nensure that implementation includes collaboration between the TA and parallel ADB activities, \nincluding two TA projects: (i) Capacity Development and Institutional Support, and (ii) Capacity \nBuilding Support for Project Identification, both of which focus on transport in Myanmar.5 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be improved national connectivity through road transport infrastructure \nimprovements.  The  outcome  will  be  the  development  of  a  road  maintenance  and  asset \nmanagement prioritization program for the part of the national road network that is the MOC\u2019s \nresponsibility. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The  TA  will  help  MOC  and  its  Public  Works  department  to  (i)  develop  a  road \nmaintenance, asset management, and investment prioritization program for the part of the \ncountry\u2019s road network that is under MOC; and (ii) develop and implement a related capacity \ndevelopment program for MOC and Public Works staff. Outputs will include (i) a comprehensive \ninventory of road assets in a management database and information system; (ii) a mechanism \nfor prioritization of road maintenance, together with an investment program for potential future \nfinancing of assets and development of performance management indicators; (iii) a program to \ndevelop capacity in asset management; and (iv) proposals for establishing mechanisms to \nfinance the management of road assets sustainably. ADB has helped other governments in \nSoutheast Asia to improve the management of their road assets, e.g., Cambodia.6 Lessons \nlearned from this experience will be incorporated in the TA. \n \n10.  Activities will include (i) preparing a detailed inventory of the road assets under MOC\u2019s \ncontrol, including their condition; (ii) determining through this analysis the parts of the network \nthat are suitable for periodic and routine maintenance programs, and those that will require \ncomplete  rehabilitation; (iii)  analyzing  MOC\u2019s  existing  asset  management  and  maintenance \noperations;  (iv)  establishing  an  asset  management  database  and  information  system; \n(v)  developing an assessment and evaluation mechanism for prioritizing road maintenance \nunder a range of defined road condition requirements and budget options; (vi) preparing and \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012.

These  proposed  approaches  could  include  private  sector \nconcessions  and  a  dedicated  road  fund  supported  by  a  fuel  or  other  transport-related \nsurcharges. The TA will review the experiences in raising such funding in other ADB developing \nmember countries, as well as in nations in Africa and South America. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,365,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, field survey teams for asset inventories and \nroad asset condition surveys, office accommodation and supplies, venues for workshops and \nseminars,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2. Disbursements under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The MOC will be the executing agency and Public Works will be the implementing \nagency. ADB will be responsible for recruiting consultants and managing their contracts. \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented during the 20 months from April 2013 to November 2014. It \nwill include consultancy services to be provided by an engineering firm or one with similar \nqualifications.  International  consultants  (31  person-months)  and  national  consultants  (28 \nperson-months) will be engaged on a full-time or intermittent basis to work with MOC and Public \nWorks staff assigned to the TA. An outline terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix \n3. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will use the quality- and cost-based \nmethod  of  selection.  It  will  employ  a  quality:cost  ratio  of  90:10  to  address  the  need  for \nexceptionally high-quality consultants that the complex project  will present. A full technical \nproposal  will  be  used  in  selecting  the  consulting  firm.  Consultants  will  manage  surveys, \nworkshops, training, seminars, and conferences under the TA budget. Equipment procurement \nwill comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nassets will be handed over to the  executing and/or implementing agency when the TA is \ncompleted. \n \n14.  Implementation will be monitored through monthly progress reports, as well as through \nthe standard reporting requirements for (i) an inception report (at the end of May 2013); (ii) an \ninterim report (at the end of March 2014); (iii) a draft final report (at the end of September 2014); \nand (iv) a final report (at the end of November 2014). The TA consultants will also provide \nreports on (i) the inventory and condition analysis of road assets in the form of a database, \nalong  with  associated  software  and  manuals;  (ii)  a  mechanism  for  road  maintenance \nprioritization in the form of a toolkit, together with associated indicative investment programs for \nfuture  financing;  (iii)  a  capacity  development  program  and  training  material  for  capacity \ndevelopment in road asset management; and (iv) future investment and financial requirements \nand  suitable  sources  of  sustainable  finance.  The  TA  will  include  workshops  and  training \nseminars for the capacity development in road asset management. \n \n ", "4   \n15.  Findings and reports from the TA will be disseminated through the ADB website. The \nwork will also be showcased at national and relevant events in Asia. \n \n16.
