INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam, through the Ministry of Health (MOH), requested that the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nstrengthen implementation of the government\u2019s flagship social health insurance (SHI) program. \nThe SHI program aims to expand access to quality and affordable basic health care services, \nespecially among the poor and marginalized groups. The TA is included in the ADB country \noperations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Viet Nam.1 During the fact-finding mission (14\u201321 April \n2016), the government and ADB agreed on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference (TOR) for consultants.2 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sustaining socioeconomic gains. Structural and market reforms since the 1986 Doi \nMoi (renovation) policy have enabled Viet Nam to achieve strong economic performance and \nsocial development outcomes. Formerly one of the poorest countries in Asia, Viet Nam has now \nattained lower-middle-income status. The poverty head count ratio fell from 60% in 1990 to 15% \nin 2010.3 The health of the Vietnamese people has improved significantly during the period \n2009\u20132013,4 which has contributed to the country\u2019s socioeconomic gains. Viet Nam\u2019s total \nhealth spending as a share of gross domestic product is now higher than that of other countries \nof similar or higher income in the region. The SHI program has become an important source of \nfinancing for health services, and is a key mechanism for improving equity in access to health \ncare, and mitigating the risk of people falling into poverty due to excessive health care spending. \nA responsive SHI program is key to sustaining growth and promoting better living conditions. \n \n3.  Making social health insurance more responsive to health care needs. Viet Nam \nhas adopted universal health coverage (UHC) as a national strategy, and has made significant \nprogress in developing SHI as a mechanism for achieving UHC. Viet Nam\u2019s SHI was initiated in \n1992 and the regulatory framework has been progressively strengthened to expand coverage, \nenforce compliance, and establish SHI funding mechanisms. The Law on Health Insurance \n(2008) created the national SHI program and established the goal of universal SHI coverage. \nThe Master Plan for Universal Coverage, launched in 2012, seeks to reach 80% SHI coverage \nby 2020.5 The attainment of universal SHI coverage is enshrined in the Constitution of Viet Nam \nof 2013. The Law on Health Insurance was amended in 2014 to introduce enhancements such \nas family-based enrollment and a basic health service package.6 \n \n4.  Several features of Viet Nam\u2019s SHI program are considered good practice based on \nworldwide experience.7 The program has a single-payer health insurance system and a unified \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

Washington, DC: World Bank. \n ", "2 \nbenefits package, and covered 76.5% of the population in 2015.8 There is a co-payment policy \nto manage service utilization, with exemptions and lower co-payment rates for the poor. Despite \nthese achievements, interrelated policy and institutional constraints\u2014pertaining to coverage, \nfragmentation, financing, risk pooling, the benefits package, provider payment mechanisms, and \nadministration\u2014have resulted in less-than-optimal performance of the SHI program. If SHI is to \nserve as a mechanism for achieving UHC, the policy and institutional framework needs to be \nevaluated, and policy actions identified to address these constraints. \n \n5.  Limited population coverage. SHI coverage increased significantly\u2014from 10 million \n(13.4% of Viet Nam\u2019s population) in 1999 to 69.9 million (76.5%) in 2015\u2014but this left 21.5 \nmillion people (23.5% of the population in 2015) uninsured, and unprotected from financial risk if \nthey become sick. Full premium subsidies ensure nearly 100% coverage among the poor and \nethnic minorities. In contrast, coverage of the near-poor remains low (55%) because these \ngroups are  required to make partial contributions to premium costs, which many of them cannot \nafford.9 Coverage among groups who receive no premium subsidies\u2014including informal sector \nworkers and dependents of workers\u2014is even lower (34%).10  \n6.  Lack  of  financial  protection.  High  enrollment  rates  among  the  poor  and  ethnic \nminorities do not translate into effective coverage. Out-of-pocket spending, which was 49.4% of \nhealth care spending in 2013, limits the financial protection of vulnerable groups and is a key \nbarrier that prevents them from accessing health services. High out-of-pocket costs are driven in \npart  by  fee-for-service  payment  mechanisms  and  hospital  autonomy  policies,  which  have \ncreated incentives for providers to increase the supply and cost of services in order to generate \nhigher revenues. \n \n7.  The effectiveness of SHI is also affected by the single benefit package, which is the \nsame for all beneficiaries, regardless of their specific health care requirements. Ensuring the \nSHI program is responsive to the needs of the elderly, who are expected to account for 26% of \nthe population by 2050, presents a critical policy challenge. About 40% of the elderly population \nis not covered by SHI;11 many are poor and live in rural areas. Designing an appropriate benefit \npackage for the elderly will increase their SHI coverage, and provide them with benefits in terms \nof both health and financial protection.  \n \n8.  Equity  and  efficient  resource  use  in  the  SHI  program  are  undermined  by  negative \nexternalities that stem from the mix of capitation and fee-for-service payment methods.12 The \ncapitation system provides district hospitals with little incentive to refer patients to secondary \nand tertiary hospitals, because referral costs are deducted from the district hospital capitation \npackage. This results in patients not receiving health care that is appropriate to their needs. \n                                                \n8  Government of Viet Nam, Viet Nam Social Security. 2016.

Health Financing Strategy of Viet Nam (2016\u20132025). Ha Noi. \n11  V. D. Dam. 2016. Speech delivered during the meeting with the Committee for the Elderly People. Ha Noi. 15 \nMarch. \n12 Under the health insurance law, three types of provider payment methods can be applied: (i) capitation, which is \nused for primary health care and covers referral costs at secondary (provincial) and tertiary (central) hospitals for \nmembers registered at the district hospitals; (ii) fee-for-service, which is used in all secondary and tertiary hospitals \nand for referral health services, including high-cost services that are not paid by capitation; and (iii) payment by \ndiagnosis-related group, which is being pilot tested in a few hospitals. \n ", "3 \nMeanwhile, secondary and tertiary hospitals have little incentive to control costs, because they \nare paid on a fee-for-service basis, while the risk is absorbed by the district hospital. \n \n9.  The capitation-based payment method exacerbates the fragmentation of risk sharing \nand revenue pooling. Capitation rates for each membership group are calculated based on \nexpenditure  patterns  in  a  given  province.  The  poor  and  near-poor  have  lower  hospital \nexpenditures because of lower service utilization rates, which result from geographical and \nfinancial barriers to access health services, and a lack of knowledge of the SHI benefits they are \nentitled to. The lower expenditure among the poor and near-poor results in their capitation rate \nbeing significantly below the premium subsidy, meaning that in effect, the poor subsidize better-\noff groups. At the provincial level, poorer provinces similarly subsidize richer provinces. District \nhospitals tend to limit their services within the capitation budget for each membership group, \nleading to underprovision of services to the poor because of their lower-value capitation rate. \n \n10.  Gaps in social health insurance financing. While the government\u2019s contribution to SHI \nhas increased since 2006, member contributions have declined.13 An increased public health \nbudget is needed to expand the number of insured vulnerable groups with state-subsidized \ninsurance premiums. However, public resource mobilization is constrained by low tax revenue \ncollection. Expanding coverage based solely on membership contributions is very unlikely to \nsucceed, because a significant proportion of those who are not enrolled are near-poor and/or \ninformal sector workers. Collecting membership contributions from the informal sector, as well \nas the private formal sector, remains a challenge. The limited options for financing SHI coupled \nwith inefficiencies in the allocation and use of SHI resources undermine the system\u2019s long-term \nfinancial  sustainability.  Interventions  to  enhance  efficiency  need  to  be  complemented  with \ninnovative financing mechanisms, such as the introduction of taxes on tobacco and alcohol. \n \n11.  Weak management and administrative capacity. Multiple ministries and organizations \nat  different  levels  are  assigned  with  SHI  management  and  administrative  responsibilities, \ncausing gaps in capacity related to enrollment enforcement, contribution collections, claims \nmanagement,  actuarial  analysis,  benefit  package  design,  and  establishment  of  payment \nmechanisms and remuneration rates.14 Differences in management structures and levels of \nauthority between MOH and Viet Nam Social Security make communication and collaboration \ndifficult. Internal fragmentation of SHI administration increases complexity and reduces the \nefficiency of SHI management. The institutional arrangements governing SHI must be reviewed \nand revised if UHC is to be achieved. Capacity building of SHI program stakeholders is needed \nto strengthen (i) program implementation through improved management and administration, \nand (ii) evidence-based policymaking through better policy analysis. \n \n12.  Link  to  ADB  strategy  and  operations.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB  strategic \npriorities in the country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Viet Nam.15 It is linked with the ADB \nOperational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, which supports developing member countries in their \nefforts to attain UHC.16 ADB\u2019s health strategy for Viet Nam aims to provide programmatic \n                                                \n13  T.V.

It \nbuilds on ADB\u2019s extensive health engagement in Viet Nam, including investments in pilot testing \ncase-based funding mechanisms that support MOH\u2019s work on provider payment reform.17 The \nTA will identify program opportunities for structural reforms in the health sector supporting UHC. \n13.  Development coordination. Development assistance to SHI has focused largely on \nanalytical work and pilot testing of approaches to increase enrollment rates, reform provider \npayment methods, and design basic health service packages. The TA will build on prior analysis \nand  pilot  testing  by  focusing  on  core  policy  issues  critical  to  system  reform,  undertaking \ncomplementary research, and developing evidence-based policy reforms required to institute \nsystemic change. Capacity building to strengthen SHI design and implementation will provide a \nfoundation for further development assistance from ADB and other development partners. \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be universal SHI coverage achieved, which aligns with the Amendments \nto the Law on Health Insurance (2014) and the Master Plan for Universal Coverage. The \noutcome will be capacity of MOH and stakeholders enhanced to support the development and \nimplementation of a responsive SHI program, especially for the poor and vulnerable people. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  Output 1: Priority legislative and regulatory measures identified and endorsed to \nappropriate authorities for decision. The TA will (i) support a review of the SHI program\u2019s \npolicy and institutional arrangements, including an assessment of the health insurance law, to \nanalyze  operational  and  systemic  constraints  impeding  SHI  program  implementation;18  (ii) \nidentify policy actions to address the constraints and support MOH in generating high-quality \npolicy notes, position papers, and research to inform policy formulation; and (iii) help MOH \ndevelop a plan to enhance SHI\u2019s regulatory and operational framework. The TA will engage \nexperienced sector specialists to provide advice and analytical inputs on priority issues. Gender \nanalysis will be a core part of the studies. Partnerships between MOH and educational or \nresearch institutions will be strengthened. A communications and advocacy plan will support the \ndissemination of policy briefs, research papers, and proposed regulatory reforms. \n \n16.  Output 2: Long-term health care model for the elderly designed and pilot tested. \nThe TA will support the development of innovative solutions to address the long-term health \ncare needs of the aging population. It will design and pilot a basic health services package for \nthe elderly, with the aim of informing MOH\u2019s broader efforts to develop a basic health services \npackage to be covered by SHI. The pilot model will be designed in accordance with international \ngood practices in long-term elderly health care and be informed by local surveys assessing the \nlevel and mix of health services provided to the elderly, and service and resource gaps. The \npilot model will be evaluated in three provinces under varying socioeconomic, demographic, and \nservice-use conditions; and its performance assessed against clinical, cost, and implementation \nefficacy indicators, and in terms of responsiveness to the needs of beneficiaries (female and \nmale). Results will be documented and disseminated to inform evidence-based policy making. \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2010.

The TA will conduct a staff learning needs assessment, with the results \nused to design and implement gender-sensitive competency-based training interventions for \nprovincial and national staff. The TA will establish a system to track learning outcomes and the \napplication of new skills by trainees. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,950,000 equivalent, of which $1,800,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, transportation costs, \nfacilities for pilot testing, office accommodation and equipment, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOH will be the executing agency and will implement the TA under the supervision and \nguidance  of  the  health  minister.  MOH\u2019s  Department  of  Health  Insurance  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. Other implementing agencies may be identified during TA implementation, \nand may include other government agencies, provincial governments, educational and research \ninstitutions, and nongovernment organizations. The TA will be implemented from 1 January \n2017 to 31 December 2018. Knowledge, lessons, outputs, and outcome evaluation will be \ndisseminated through workshops, publications, websites, and print and social media. \n \n20.  ADB will engage 9 person-months of international and 190 person-months of national \nconsultant services. The consultant TOR are in Appendix 3. To maximize flexibility, the TOR \nand  selection  criteria  for  4  person-months  of  the  international  consulting  services  will  be \ndetermined during implementation. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with \nADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).19 The project \nmanagement specialist will follow ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime)  in  procuring  equipment,  which  will  be  transferred  to  MOH  after  TA  completion.  The \nconsultants will administer the activity costs related to the studies, workshops, training, and \nconferences, and prepare the TOR for resource persons.
