The  Government  of  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Kunming-Haiphong \nTransport Corridor Project. The TA was identified as a priority regional transport project under \nthe ADB-supported Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program and is \nincluded in ADB's TA program for Viet Nam. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam from \n30 September to 12 October 2002 and held discussions with the Government on the goals, \npurpose, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference of the TA.1  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet  Nam  has  actively  supported  cooperation  within  the  GMS.  Cross-border  road \nprojects have been the most tangible signs of Viet Nam's contribution to GMS integration. The \nPhnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City Highway and East-West Transport Corridor projects have helped \nto strengthen infrastructure linkages with Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and \nThailand. The proposed project will connect Yunnan Province of the People's Republic of China \n(PRC) with Viet Nam. ADB's assistance will help to further develop the subregional transport \nsystem.  \n3.  In 1994, ADB supported a preliminary feasibility study to identify high priority GMS \ntransport projects, and the Kunming-Haiphong transport corridor was selected as an important \none. It includes three transportation modes: a road linking Kunming to Lao Cai to Haiphong; a \nrailway  from  Kunming  to  Lao  Cai  to  Hanoi  to  Haiphong;  and  the  Red  River  Navigation \nImprovement Project, which connects Yunnan Province with Viet Nam via inland waterways. \nThe road project was found to be economically viable, whereas more investigations were \nrequired to examine the economic viability of the other two options.  \n4.  The 865-kilometer (km) Kunming-Haiphong road passes through Yunnan Province of the \nPRC and nine provinces of Viet Nam.2 The road network in Yunnan Province is well developed, \npartly two-lane and partly four-lane expressway. On the Viet Nam side, the project road extends \nfrom Lao Cai to Hanoi and then to Haiphong. The civil works for improving the highway from \nHanoi to Haiphong were carried out under assistance from other aid agencies, and thus only the \n282-km section from Lao Cai to Hanoi needs to be upgraded to complete the entire Kunming-\nHaiphong link. This road covers sections of national highways 1, 3, and 4D, plus the full length \nof national highway 70 and a large part of national highway 2. Most of the sections of the project \nroad in Viet Nam are narrow with unusable shoulders and contain a number of bridges with \nlimited capacity. Daily traffic volume varies between 1,300 and 2,500 passenger car-converted \nunits.3 Within these levels, the share of motorcycles and bicycles is very high around population \ncenters. Considerable delays are experienced due to motorcycles and nonmotorized vehicle \ntraffic on the road. Because the existing road sections in Viet Nam are underdeveloped, cross-\ncountry traffic is currently negligible, but this is expected to change with the cross-border \narrangements that will be in place by 2005 between the PRC and Viet Nam.   \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 July 2002. \n2  Lao Cai, Yen Bi, Ph\u00f3 Th\u00e4, Vinh Ph\u00f3c, Hanoi, Bac Ninh, Hi Dong, Quang Ninh, and Haiphong provinces. \n3 Passenger car unit is defined as converting volumes of mixed traffic with trucks, buses, recreational vehicles, \npassenger cars, motorcycles and other vehicles to equivalent volumes of passenger cars. ", "2 \n5.  The Kunming-Lao Cai-Haiphong railway link, formerly known as the Indochina railroad, \nconsists of 468 km between Kunming and the Vietnamese border and 385 km within Viet Nam \nfrom Lao Cai to Haiphong via Hanoi. The line has an annual capacity of 5 million tons per year \non the PRC side but much lower on the Viet Nam side. Traffic estimates indicate that in 1999 \nabout 1.2 million tons of cargo and about 0.6 million passengers used this link in Viet Nam. A \nrailway improvement project would require renovation of railway structures and signal and \ncommunication facilities along the entire length of the railway line in Viet Nam, rehabilitation or \nreconstruction of most of the bridges, and investments in rolling stock and other facilities.  \n6.  While the inland water mode is principally serving domestic transport requirements at \npresent, the Red River Inland waterway improvement project has significant potential for serving \ngreater international traffic in GMS. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is preparing \na feasibility study for this project. The scope of the project includes dredging, provision of \nnavigation aids, port improvement, and realignment of shoals.  \n7.  Viet  Nam  has  an  extensive  program  for  road  network  upgradation  and  railway \nmodernization in the medium term. Regional projects such as the Kunming-Haiphong Transport \nCorridor Project present special challenges, as the benefits from such projects accrue to the \nregion as a whole, whereas the country needs to assume large debt and face social and \nenvironmental impacts. The Government has requested ADB to include in its scope financing \noptions for such projects so as to maximize benefits for the country while regional objectives are \nalso met. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to assist the Government to prepare a Project to upgrade the \nKunming-Haiphong transport corridor over the sections in Viet Nam. The Project will strengthen \nthe regional infrastructure network and will also improve the domestic transportation system \nconnecting Hanoi with the northern provinces. The improved transport network will not only \nenhance access to Lao Cai Province, which is among the poorest in Viet Nam and has a \nnumber of ethnic minorities, but will also open up opportunities for growing trade and investment \nin the region.  \n9.  The TA will be implemented in two phases: the first phase will examine the prefeasibility \nand viability of  improvements in roads, railways  or inland waterways  to select the optimum \ntransport mode for this corridor. JICA has funded a feasibility study to explore the overall \nfeasibility and viability of inland water system improvements and a report is expected to be \navailable in the early 2003. This phase will review all important aspects necessary to suggest \nthe appropriate transport mode, including comparative analysis of the technical feasibility of all \noptions,  economic  and  financial  viability,  resettlement,  and  other  social  impacts  for  the \nKunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor Project. Outline terms of reference for this phase of the \nstudy are in Appendix 1.  \n10.  Depending  on  the  outcome  of  the  first  phase,  a  detailed  feasibility  study  will  be \nundertaken for either the road improvement or railway improvement. Outline terms of reference \nfor the second phase are in Appendix 1. The key outputs of the TA are summarized below: \n ", "    3 \n(i)  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  economic  and  financial  viability  as  well  as \nresettlement and other social impacts of railway versus road improvement for the \nKunming-Haiphong transport corridor; \n(ii)  assessment of the resource requirements and development of financing options, \nincluding  assessment  of  the  availability  of  public  and  private  resources  for \ntransport  projects;  assessment  of  private  sector  capacity  to  undertake  such \nprojects; comparative analyses of financing options such as lease, concessions, \nmanagement contracts, build-operate-transfer, long-term domestic bonds, etc.; \nand  suggested  policy  and  other  measures  necessary  to  implement  large \ntransport projects as public-private partnership projects; \n(iii)  feasibility and viability studies as per the detailed terms of reference identified in \nAppendix 1, including all drawings, specifications and data required for tendering \nof the project;  \n(iv)  detailed environmental impact assessment and summary environmental impact \nassessment in accordance with the ADB's  Guidelines on the Environmental \nImpacts of Infrastructure Projects, Environmental Assessment Requirements of \nthe Asian Development Bank, and Environment Policy; \n(v)  a resettlement plan as per the ADB's  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement  and \nHandbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice; \n(vi)  an ethnic minorities development plan, in accordance with the ADB's Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples; \n(vii)  assessment of institutional arrangements, including proposed mechanisms to \ncollect  road  user  charges  for  domestic  and  international  traffic  to  generate \nadequate resources to cover debt service and road operation and maintenance \ncosts if the road is selected as the optimum mode; \n(viii)  a reform program for institutional strengthening of the railway if the feasibility \nstudy covers it; and  \n(ix)  prequalification and bid documents for the civil works, and terms of reference for \nconstruction supervision consulting services. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will cover the following major activities in the first phase: (i) review the present \ncondition of the Kunming-Haiphong transport network; (ii) evaluate the viability of the rail versus \nroad options from the point of view of technical, environmental, social, resettlement, economic, \nand financial analyses and submit to ADB and the Government a set of recommendations on \nthe  optimum  mode  and  phasing;  (iii)  assess  the  preliminary  social,  environmental,  and \nresettlement impacts of the road and railway options; and (iv) identify and explore all possible \nsources of finance (such as build-operate-transfer, lease, bonds, etc.) to fund this transport \ncorridor project. The recommendations of the studies will be prepared as a Phase I report and \ndiscussed at a tripartite meeting with ADB and the Government to decide on the optimum \ntransport mode.  ", "4 \n12.  Depending  on  the  recommendations  and  discussions  with  the  Government,  in  the \nsecond phase, a feasibility study will be prepared, either for road improvement from Lao Cai to \nHanoi or railway improvement from Lao Cai to Haiphong. The major activities will include \n(i) prepare a feasibility report for the railway or road network, (ii) prepare an environmental \n(category A) impact assessment, (iii) prepare social assessments as per ADB's applicable \nguidelines,  (iv)  carry  out  detailed  poverty  analyses,  (v)  prepare  a  plan  for  involuntary \nresettlement and ethnic minorities development, (vi) prepare a self-contained report on financing \noptions for transport projects as public-private partnerships, and (vi) perform other studies \nidentified in the outline terms of reference. \n13.  An initial social and poverty assessment has been carried out for a road project. The \nsummary assessment is presented in Appendix 2, and a detailed analysis is available as \nSupplementary Appendix A. The existing alignment for the road project may require significant \nresettlement, and hence steps will be needed to identify minor realignments and bypasses so as \nto reduce the scale of resettlement. Railway improvement is not expected to involve significant \nresettlement, but this will be further examined during TA implementation if the railway is chosen. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,250,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $723,000 and a local currency cost of $527,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$1,000,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $277,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government will finance $250,000 equivalent in terms of local \nlogistic support, counterpart staff, and other costs including vehicles. The detailed costs are \npresented in Appendix 3.  \n15.  The Government has been informed that provision of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing investment project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The first phase of the study will be implemented by individual experts for about 28 \nperson-months inclusive of 7 person-months of international and 21 person-months of domestic \nconsultants. The international consultants will include 3 person-months for a transport specialist/ \nteam leader, 2 person-months for a railway and highway engineer, and 2 person-months for a \nfinancial specialist. The domestic consultants will include 7 person-months for traffic surveyors, \n6 person-months for engineering support, 2 person-months for initial environmental impact \nassessment,  and  6  person-months  for  initial  social  impact  assessment.  The  Ministry  of \nTransport will submit to the Government the results of the Phase I. Phase II will commence after \nthe Government's decision on the selected option is available.  \n17.  The second phase of the TA will be implemented by a firm of consultants to prepare a \nfeasibility  study  for  either  a  road  improvement  project  or  a  railway  upgradation  project, \ndepending on the outcome of the first phase. This phase will require consulting services of \nabout 90 person-months, inclusive of 20 person-months of international and 70 person-months \nof domestic consultants including surveyors and data numerators. The expertise needed for the \nconsulting services will include transport planning, highway or railway engineering, structural \nand other engineering, unexploded ordnance clearance, economic analysis, financial analysis, \nenvironmental impact assessment, social assessment, drafting, and contract preparation. The \nteam leader of the consultants will require expertise in multimodal transport, cross-border traffic, \n ", "    5 \ntoll  arrangements,  institutional  reform,  and  project  management.  The  consultants  will  be \nrecruited by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.   \n18.  The TA will be implemented by the Ministry of Transport (Project Management Unit 5 \nand Vietnam Railways), which will provide four full-time counterpart staff and a similar number \nof part-time support staff located in Hanoi. The TA will be prepared in close consultation with the \nPRC  Government  and  especially  with  the  Yunnan  Provincial  Government.

While significant in terms of magnitude, \nprogress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d clustered just above the \npoverty line. To support the Government in pursuing balanced economic growth and reduction of poverty, the Country \nStrategy Program Update 2003\u20132005 for Viet Nam and the Poverty Partnership Agreement between Viet Nam and \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasize regional cooperation through cross-border trade and access to \nmarkets within the region. This project will help develop the subregional transport system and improve intersectoral \nlinkages through the development of an economic corridor. Remoteness and disconnection have been identified as \nfactors for poor people\u2019s inability to benefit from economic growth. Improved transport infrastructure will contribute to \nregionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating agricultural production, increasing access to \nemployment opportunities, and facilitating better access to social services. \n \nB.
