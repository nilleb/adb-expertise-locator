THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The  regional  transaction  technical  assistance (TA) facility  will  support  clean  energy \nprojects for (i) project feasibility and due diligence, (ii) capacity development and implementation \nsupport, and (iii) cross-departmental green energy project pipeline development. For (i), the \nfacility will conduct project preparation activities for the Grid Reinforcement Project with Additional \nFinancing  (Cambodia),  Climate  Change  Policy  Program  (Philippines),  and  Power  Grid \nStrengthening Project (Timor-Leste). For (ii), project implementation support will be provided for \nSustainable  and  Reliable  Energy  Access  Program  (Indonesia)  and  Sustainable  Energy \nTransition\u2013DAMRI E-bus Project (Indonesia).1 For (iii), the TA facility will develop a pipeline of \ngreen energy projects for investment under the One-ADB framework, involving collaboration \namong the Energy Division (SEEN) and the Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision of the Southeast Asia Department, Office of Public-Private Partnership (OPPP), and \nPrivate Sector Operations Department (PSOD).2 \n \n2.  These energy sector projects require common preparatory due diligence activities such \nas  preliminary  technical  design,  economic  analysis,  financial  assessment,  safeguards  due \ndiligence, procurement risk assessment, and strategic planning. Project preparation also requires \nclimate risk and vulnerability assessment, climate finance analysis, and gender analysis and \naction planning. By combining these activities into an integrated TA facility, consulting resources \ncan be shared in a more optimal manner among various countries and projects to reduce TA \nadministration costs and maximize the efficiency of using scarce TA resources.3 \n \n3.  Continued  urbanization,  the  increasing  size  of  middle  class  population,  and  rapidly \ngrowing commercial and industrial activities have contributed to  a significant upsurge in electricity \ndemand in Southeast Asia. Reliable and affordable electricity supply to meet this demand has \nbeen and remains a key enabler of inclusive and sustainable growth. This is even more important \nfor the recovery from the severe impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.   \n \n4.  The Southeast Asian countries also need to address the long-term socioeconomic impacts \ninduced  by  global  climate  change  to  achieve  sustainable  development.  Under  the  Paris \nAgreement, each country has committed to specific national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission \nreduction targets. As electricity production based on fossil fuels is one of the largest GHG emitters, \ncountries are adopting strategies to a just transition toward renewable energy-based electricity \nsupply and undertake demand-side management measures to conserve electricity. \n \n5.  Recent technological innovations have led to a rapid reduction of solar and wind electricity \nproduction costs by almost threefold compared to 10 years ago. This cost reduction, coupled with \nenabling policies (such as feed-in-tariff) and market innovations (such as solar auctions), has led \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2021\u20132023. Manila; ADB. 2020. Country Operations \nBusiness Plan: Indonesia, 2021\u20132023. Manila; and  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Timor-Leste, \n2021\u20132023. Manila. \n2  Future support by the TA facility is anticipated for the National Project on Energy Storage for Utility-Scale Solar Plants \n(Cambodia), Clean Electricity Supply Program (Indonesia), Geothermal Power Expansion Project (Indonesia), Power \nInterconnection Project (Indonesia), and Rural Electrification Project (Viet Nam).  \n3  In October 2018, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a regional transaction TA facility phase 1 (ADB. \n2018. Technical Assistance to the Southeast Asia Energy Sector Development, Investment Planning and Capacity \nBuilding Facility. Manila), which supports a series of energy projects and programs in the Southeast Asia countries. \nThis proposed TA facility is a second phase, which will continue to support countries in preparing energy investment \nprojects for approval by ADB and the governments during the period 2022\u20132024.  \n \n ", "2   \nto a substantial increase in solar and wind capacity worldwide. Electric battery and energy storage \ntechnologies  are  also  becoming  more  available  and  affordable  solutions  to  balance  the \nintermittent solar and wind power supply and to improve network reliability and stability. Electric \nvehicles are being increasingly promoted to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector. A \nfaster diffusion of such technological advancements creates increasingly favorable conditions in \nSoutheast Asia for transitioning to energy systems with lower carbon emissions. The private \nsector is already playing a key role in introducing innovation and scaling up investment, with public \nsector interventions that are largely focused on improving the policy and regulatory environment \nfor private sector participation and market-oriented sector development. The proposed TA facility \nwill help Southeast Asia countries to accelerate the adoption of these innovations such as the \nintegration of battery energy storage systems into transmission grids to handle higher shares of \nwind- and solar-based electricity supply and installation of more solar and wind power stations to \nachieve a just transition toward sustainable energy sector development.  \n \n6.  The series of investment projects to be supported under the TA facility represent a \nbalanced mix of investment proposals that will (i) continue to strengthen and expand power \nsystem capacities to serve the increasing demand and (ii) utilize renewable energy (solar, wind, \nand waste-to-energy), and develop technologies for their integration into a greener electricity \nsystem. The TA facility, therefore, helps the Southeast Asia countries to meet fast growing \nelectricity demand in a sustainable manner. \n \n7.  In supporting the transition to a greener, lower carbon, and inclusive energy sector \ndevelopment, the TA facility is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.4 The ensuing projects will \ncontribute to increasing access to reliable electricity supply to meet basic needs and improve \nquality of life (operational priority [OP] 1), skills development for women and productive use of \nwomen\u2019s time (OP2), tacking climate change at its core and building disaster resilience smart \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks  (OP3),  promoting  rural  development  (OP5),  and \nstrengthening institutional capacity for the governments (OP6). It is anticipated that the TA facility \nwill also support projects that enable livable cities and urban development, contributing to OP4. \nThe  TA  strongly  supports  renewable  energy  projects  in  the  Southeast  Asian  countries, \ncontributing  to  tackling  climate  change  and  enhancing  energy-environment  sustainability  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s announcement to provide $100 billion climate financing by 2030.5 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Project feasibility studies and due diligence prepared. For projects listed in \npara. 1 item (i), the TA facility will support their project preparation activities, including: (i) technical \nfeasibility studies, design, and cost estimates; (ii) economic analysis; (iii) financial management \nassessments  and  financial  analysis;  (iv) procurement  risk  assessments  and  preparation  of \nstrategic procurement plans, and preparation of bidding documents; (v) gender analysis and \npreparation of gender action plans;  (vi) risk assessment and management plan; (vii) preparation \nof safeguards documents on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples; (viii) \nintegrity due diligence; (ix) initial poverty and social analysis; (x) climate and disaster resilience \nmeasures, climate risk and adaptation assessment, and disaster risk assessment; (xi) climate \nfinancing  analysis;  (xii)  sector  assessment;  and  (xiii)  other  documents  required  for  project \napproval.  \n \n4 ADB. 2018.

Capacity development support for executing and implementing agencies is \nparticularly important at the beginning of project implementation before the project implementation \nconsultants commence services. Further support will also be provided as more specific needs for \ncapacity building emerge during project implementation. These activities may include, among \nothers: (i) overall project management with quality control; (ii) procurement-related tasks; (iii) \nimplementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards  measures  and  plans;  (iv)  project \nmonitoring, reporting, and public consultation; and (v) institutional gender mainstreaming. In \naddition, the TA facility will support implementation tasks requiring special expertise, such as \nclimate and disaster risk assessment and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. \nImmediate support will be provided for projects in para. 1, item (ii). \n \n10.  Output 3: Pipeline of cross-departmental green energy projects developed. The TA \nfacility will support the Southeast Asian countries to (i) develop relatively more challenging \nrenewable electricity generation projects such as offshore wind, floating solar, and waste-to-\nenergy for electricity generation; and (ii) integrate the renewable electricity generated into flexible \nand smart transmission and distribution grids, including the use of battery energy storage systems. \nActivities will include conducting prefeasibility studies to ascertain technical and economic viability, \nand proposing technological solutions for integration into the national electricity system. As a \nresult,  a  pipeline  of  renewable  energy  projects  will  be  prepared  for  investment,  involving \ncollaboration among SEEN, OPPP, and PSOD under the One-ADB approach. Projects in the \npipeline will be supported jointly by both sovereign and nonsovereign operations, such that \ninvestment for grid integration and common facilities will be supported by SEEN, while investment \nfor renewable generating capacities may be tendered out for the private sector with OPPP and \nPSOD support. Projects to be supported under this output currently include Waste-to-Energy \nProject (Cambodia), Off-shore Wind Power Project (Thailand), and Battery Energy Storage \nSystem Project (Viet Nam). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $2.76 million, of which (i) $2.50 million will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7: $1.50 million, TASF-other \nsources: $1.00 million); and (ii) $0.26 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate \nChange Fund.6 The key expenditure items and indicative TA budget allocation per outputs are \nlisted in Appendix 1.  \n \n12.  The TA facility scope is expected to be expanded to support additional projects identified \nduring future ADB country programming missions, consistent with the TA\u2019s outputs. The TA facility \nwill be replenished from time to time as funds are required and identified, including those from \ncofinancing sources and ADB-administered trust funds. \n  \n13.  The  governments  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff,  office  and \ncommunication facilities, and other in-kind contributions. The governments were informed that \napproval of the TA facility does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA facility and will administer and implement it \nthrough SEEN.
