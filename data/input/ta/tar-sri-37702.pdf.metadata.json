The Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal \nin 1999 and subsequently embraced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as priority \nobjectives. Both poverty reduction and fostering fulfillment of the MDGs are affirmed in ADB\u2019s \nLong-Term  Strategic  Framework  (2001\u20132015)1  and  Medium-Term  Strategy  (2001\u20132005).2 \nPoverty reduction is also the focus of the country strategy and program (CSP). Nevertheless, \nwith the CSP being revised this year, ADB\u2019s capacity to monitor the impact of its activities on \npoverty in Sri Lanka remains weak. In addition, ADB needs to strengthen its support of the \nGovernment  in  actualizing  the  existing  poverty  partnership  agreement  (PPA)  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to analyze and monitor poverty data. The Cooperation Fund in Support \nof  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategies  (NPRS) \nprovides an opportunity to do so. \n \n2.   The concept paper for this 3-year technical assistance (TA) was prepared in June 2003, \nbased  on  prior  discussions  with  Sri  Lankan  professionals  engaged  in  the  field  of  poverty \nresearch and analysis. An ADB peer review was conducted on 2 July 2003. The revised paper \nwas submitted to NPRS in mid-July 2003. On 30 July 2003, the NPRS review committee \nformally endorsed the proposal.3 The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Sri Lanka has suffered from a civil war that has lasted more than 20 years. While much \nof the obvious physical destruction has been concentrated in the north and east, the entire \ncountry has suffered in many ways. Large amounts of government revenues have been diverted \nfrom sectors such as education, health, and infrastructure improvement/maintenance to feed the \nwar effort. Tens of thousands of young men and women have been enlisted as combatants on \nboth sides, producing an entire generation with few marketable skills for peacetime. Due to the \ninsecure  and  unpredictable  environment,  business  people  have  withheld  investment  in \nproductive facilities, preferring to accumulate their resources in ways not always helpful to the \nnational  economy  or  to  place  them  outside  the  country  in  safer  locations.  The  massive \nresources required for the war have produced a deterioration in the overall macroeconomic \nclimate. The result has been a weakened economy with many former middle-income families, \nespecially in the north and east, gradually sliding into poverty. Meanwhile, because of the \ntightening of the country\u2019s fiscal position, the government is unable to offer either a safety net or \na way out for impoverished families. This difficulty is compounded by poor targeting in many \nexisting social programs. \n \n4.  Over the past few years, the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has made \nconsiderable efforts to address gaps in poverty-related data collected in all parts of the country, \nnotably via the census on population and housing in 2001, the census of agriculture in 2002, the \nhousehold income and expenditure survey in 2002, and the extension of the quarterly labour \nforce survey to the north and east in early 2003. To this can be added the consumer finances \nand socioeconomic survey planned by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in 2003/04. In \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001. The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank (2001-2015). Manila. \n2 ADB. 2001. Medium-Term Strategy. Manila. \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 15 September 2003. ", "2  \naddition, DCS has developed and made available methodology for calculating sectoral and \nprovincial poverty lines based on the 1995/96 survey. Nevertheless, there is general agreement \nthat  data  collected  by  various  government  and  aid  actors  working  in  the  poverty  sector \noccasionally lacks the consistency required to compare data from different actors. Because of \nconditions on the ground over the past 20 years, the gaps and inconsistencies are particularly \nnoticeable with regard to the north and east. Furthermore, the multiple dimensions of poverty \nare generally not adequately taken into account in current survey methods. Finally, the capacity \nof responsible government agencies and major aid organizations to effectively analyze the  \navailable  data  both  quantitatively  and  qualitatively  and  to  define  the  supplementary  data \nrequired for improved analysis is rather weak, it is therefore difficult to assess the real impact of \nthe government\u2019s and the aid community\u2019s poverty reduction programs. Because of the growing \nemphasis on poverty reduction in national development strategies laid out by the Government of \nSri Lanka, this is an opportune time to address these issues. The proposed TA will help the \nGovernment, ADB, and other key development actors to better understand the poverty context \nof their interventions and thus improve targeting to maximize the impact on poverty reduction. \nStrengthening the government\u2019s, ADB\u2019s, and the aid community\u2019s understanding of Sri Lanka\u2019s \npoverty profile has become even more urgent following the recent Tokyo Donors\u2019 Conference, \nwhich pledged approximately $4.5 billion to support the government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy \n\u2014Regaining Sri Lanka\u2014including rehabilitation of the conflict-affected northern and eastern \nareas of the country. \n \n5.  Although DCS has made notable efforts to define and measure poverty lines over the \npast few years, various government and aid agencies still employ somewhat different definitions \nof  poverty.  As  a  result,  no  single  satisfactory  definition  has  been  formally  adopted  by  all \nconcerned state authorities and major aid agencies. In cases where similar poverty definitions \nare employed, the conceptual underpinnings of the definitions are not always well understood \nby all parties. The problem is compounded by the use of different reference points by different \nauthors computing poverty lines over the past decades, making the analysis of poverty trends \nhighly problematic. The two official agencies vested with the primary task of data gathering, \nDCS and CBSL, produce data that is rich and reliable. However, more work needs to be done to \ndevelop the capacity to present this data\u2014especially poverty-related data\u2014in ways that meet \nthe poverty information needs of potential clients. In summary, the meeting point between the \ndata producers and data users is less than optimal. \n \n6.  With respect to the north and east, the Government\u2019s capacity to measure and monitor \npoverty has been constrained by the conflict going on for two decades. The population census \nwas held in 2001 after a delay of 10 years and provides some useful data for much of the \ncountry, while the household income and expenditure survey carried out by DCS was extended \nto the north and east in 2002. However, gaps in knowledge persist, particularly with respect to \nthe micro conditions of inhabitants in the eight conflict-affected districts of the north and east. \nThe  official  surveys  can  give  disaggregated  data  only  down  to  the  district  level,  an \nadministrative unit that can encompass a diversified population of several hundred thousand \npeople spread over a wide area. ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The goal of the TA over its 3-year duration is to strengthen the effectiveness of poverty \nreduction programs in Sri Lanka. The purpose is (i) to build on work already done so as to \nimprove  instruments  and  methodologies  used  to  define  and  monitor  the  extent  and  many \ndimensions of poverty in both its quantitative and qualitative aspects in Sri Lanka, and (ii) to \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  relevant  state  and  other  agencies  to  effectively  use  these \ninstruments. The scope of the project will be nationwide. It is important to emphasize that by \nbuilding  on  the  work  and  skills  already  existing  in  the  poverty  field  in  Sri  Lanka,  in  both \ngovernment agencies and civil society, the project will avoid duplication of work already being \ndone and reinforce the capacity of the existing actors to competently fulfill their respective \nmandates.  \n \n8.  The specific outputs of the TA are described in the TA framework (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The methodology of the project progresses from an information-gathering phase, to one \nof digesting and repackaging the information, to one of exploring how this information can \ncontribute practically to strengthening data collection and analysis on both the monitoring and \nimpact levels, to one of testing the new data collection instruments, to finally one of testing the \nimpact assessment instruments. Significant efforts have already been made in Sri Lanka and in \nother  countries  to  examine  the  phenomenon  of  poverty;  however,  the  efforts  have  lacked \ncoordination. Therefore, the first activity will be to carry out research into analytical work already \ndone on poverty in Sri Lanka and elsewhere, including a review of existing documentation, plus \ninterviews with key people working in the field of poverty reduction in the country. The interviews \nwill encompass consultations with state and nonstate actors who have already done work in  \npoverty assessment or poverty reduction, as well as in the national planning sector, to ensure \nthe inclusiveness of outputs emerging from the following activity. \n \n10.  The second activity will prepare for submission to DCS draft definitions of poverty and \npoverty assessment indicators to monitor the degree and nature of poverty in Sri Lanka, building \non  work  already  done,  and  a  methodology  for  evaluating  the  impact  of  poverty  reduction \nprojects  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  The  definitions  will  address  the  multidimensional \nconcept  of  poverty  and  will  consider  possible  gender  differences  in  the  way  poverty  is \nexperienced. This activity will involve carrying out iterative consultations with selected poverty \nreduction specialists in Sri Lanka and validating these tools with a sampling of those suffering \nfrom poverty to ensure relevance and practicality. \n \n11.  The third activity will, in close collaboration with DCS and other state actors, assess the \ncurrent state of their poverty information and analysis systems, notably their ability to track both \nthe quantitative and qualitative evolution of poverty using participatory methodologies, and their \ncapacity building needs in consequence. It will then devise and execute a training program to \naddress gaps and weaknesses, if and where they exist, as well as identify possible further \nsupport  requirements.  This  capacity  building  component  will  include  workshops  with  key \nmembers  of  the  aid  community  in  Sri  Lanka  to  present  and  explain  the  methodologies ", "4  \ndeveloped earlier to evaluate the impact of poverty reduction projects, with the aim of increasing \nthe future availability of comparable poverty reduction impact data. \n \n12.  The fourth activity will involve carrying out a poverty survey of the eight conflict-affected \ndistricts, using the agreed-upon definition of poverty and the poverty assessment tools (para. \n10), in collaboration with government officials, civil society, and other relevant nonstate actors. \nThe data thus collected, disaggregated to at least the division level (one level below a district), \nwill be juxtaposed with data collected previously in the southern parts of the country as well as \nwith data already collected by DCS. The collected data will also be disaggregated according to \ngender and main identity group. \n \n13.  The fifth and final activity will involve assessment of an ADB-supported project and two \nother aid projects (with the assent of the concerned aid agency and the executing agency) to \ntest the appropriateness of the poverty definitions and measuring instruments, as well as the \nutility of the evaluation methodologies developed earlier. This activity will accompanied by a \nreport outlining the lessons learned from the pilot study and the ensuing recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $439,000 equivalent, comprising $60,500 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $378,500  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $350,000 \nequivalent, comprising $60,500 in foreign exchange and $289,500 equivalent in local currency. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis from the National Poverty Reduction Strategies Fund. \nThe Government will finance the remaining $89,000 equivalent of the local currency costs \ncovering  in-kind  support  such  as  office  facilities,  local  transport,  and  staff  time.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The TA will finance consulting services, capacity building activities, a poverty survey, a \npilot poverty impact assessment, the acquisition of computer and transportation equipment and \nrelated project management and support costs.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency of the TA will be DCS. ADB will recruit a domestic consulting firm \nor research group (hereinafter referred to as the consultants) experienced in poverty research \nand analysis, to implement the 3-year contract. This will be a domestic contract to ensure the \nselection of organizations that are fully familiar with the nature of poverty in Sri Lanka, with \nexisting efforts to monitor and reduce poverty, and with the work of the key actors in this sector, \nnotably the government counterparts. The choice will ensure a more efficient start-up phase and \na  more  relevant,  high-quality  TA  output.  The  selected  agency  may  nevertheless  wish  to \nincorporate some international expertise to provide supplementary technical input. This has \nbeen provided for in the TA cost estimates. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with \nits Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  \nengaging domestic consultants, using the simplified technical proposal and the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method.  Outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  Equipment \npurchases will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n17.  The consultants will be responsible for all aspects of project implementation and will \nreport regularly to DCS. To ensure that the Project outputs are as inclusive as possible, DCS \nwill assemble and chair a review committee composed of representatives from (in addition to ", "    5 \nDCS) the Central Data Committee, the Ministry of Policy Development and Implementation, the \ncivil society and the academic sector, as well as an ADB liaison person designated by the Sri \nLanka  Resident  Mission  (SLRM)  Country  Director.  The  consultants  will  also  attend  review \ncommittee meetings as resource persons. The review committee will meet at least quarterly. \nState agencies whose focus is on poverty monitoring or reduction are considered prime clients \nof this TA; therefore the consultants will also consult closely with them at all stages of the \nproject. DCS, in addition to its general management role, will provide office space, as required, \nfor the consultants when they are carrying out the research and interview phase of the project, \nas well as for the staff participating in the training and surveys that are part of the project. DCS \nwill also provide transportation to the consultants, as required, to attend meetings and other \nactivities  in  Colombo.  In  addition  to  DCS,  other  government  agencies  participating  in  the \nactivities of this TA will each designate one of their officials as a focal point for the duration of \nthe project. \n \n18.  The consultants will prepare and submit to DCS, ADB, and the review committee (i) brief \nquarterly  status  reports  on  progress  achieved,  problems  encountered,  and  plans  for  the \nsubsequent quarter; (ii) detailed annual reports at the end of the first and second years on \noverall progress against the objectives; and (iii) a final report including achievements with \nregard  to  each  objective,  as  well  as  appendixes  detailing  poverty  definitions  agreed  on, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  tools  selected,  training  content,  a  summary  of  survey  findings, \nconclusions  from  the  trial  impact  assessments,  and  recommendations.  The  report  will  be \npresented in a workshop open to those working in the poverty reduction sector in Sri Lanka; \ndisseminated to all government organizations interested in poverty reduction programs, aid \nagencies  involved  in  poverty  reduction,  NGO  umbrella  organizations,  national  research \ninstitutes involved in poverty-related issues, ADB, and other organizations who request it; and \nbe made available to a wider audience through the Internet. In addition, the plan is to make the \nfinal report the subject of a seminar open to all interested parties at ADB\u2019s Manila headquarters. \n \n19.  All the key activities indicated in paras. 9-13 assume that qualified consultants can be \ncontracted, that access to the conflict-affected parts of the country will be readily feasible, and \nthat the project will receive collaboration from the relevant state and nonstate actors. Based on \ncurrent and expected conditions in Sri Lanka, these assumptions appear to be reasonable. \n \n20.  The expected starting date for the TA is March 2004 and the expected completion date \nis February 2007. \n \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to the Government \nof Sri Lanka to be financed on a grant basis by the National Poverty Reduction Strategies Fund \nfor Poverty Assessment and Information Management, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n       \nStrengthened poverty reduction  Strengthened capacity of  Written assessment  Continued \nprograms in Sri Lanka  the relevant bodies to track  by DCS and the  progress in the \n  and analyze poverty trends  multipartite  normalization of \ncommittee  the country as a \nreviewing the  result of the peace \nproject\u2019s progress  process \n \nPurpose       \n       \nImprove instruments and  Production and use of  Examination of the  Willingness of all \nmethodologies used to define and  agreed-upon definitions and  tools and  main actors in the \nmonitor the extent and nature of  instruments to improve the  methodologies  project to accept a \npoverty in Sri Lanka and strengthen  quantitative and qualitative  produced, as well  common set of \nthe capacity of the relevant state  monitoring of poverty in Sri  as the conclusions  tools and \nand other agencies to effectively  Lanka and assessment of  emerging from the  methodologies \nuse these instruments  the impact of poverty  pilot study \n  reduction programs \n  ", "        Appendix 1  7\nOutputs       \n       \n1.

Background \n \n1.  Sri Lanka has suffered from a civil war that has lasted more than 20 years. While much \nof the obvious physical destruction has been concentrated in the north and east, the entire \ncountry has suffered in many ways. The economy is weakened with many former middle-\nincome families, especially in the north and east, gradually sliding into poverty. Meanwhile, \nbecause of the Government\u2019s fragile fiscal position, the authorities are unable to offer either a \nsafety  net  or  a  way  out  for  impoverished  families.  This  difficulty  is  compounded  by  poor \ntargeting many existing social programs. \n \n2.  Over the past few years, the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has made \nconsiderable efforts to address gaps in poverty-related data collected in all parts of the country, \nnotably via several censuses and surveys from 2001. In addition, DCS has developed and \nmade available methodology for calculating sectoral and provincial poverty lines based on the \n1995/96  survey.  Nevertheless,  there  is  general  agreement  that  data  collected  by  various \ngovernment and aid actors working in the poverty sector occasionally lacks the consistency \nrequired to compare data between actors. Because of conditions over the past 20 years, the \ngaps and inconsistencies are particularly noticeable with regard to data from the north and east. \nFinally,  the  capacity  of  responsible  government  agencies  and  major  aid  organizations  to \neffectively  analyze  the  available  data  and  to  define  the  supplementary  data  required  for \nimproved  analysis  is  rather  weak.  It  is  therefore  difficult  to  assess  the  real  impact  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s and the aid community\u2019s poverty reduction programs. Because of the growing \nemphasis on poverty reduction in national development strategies laid out by the Government of \nSri Lanka, this is an opportune time to address these issues. The proposed project will help the \nADB and other key development actors, including the Government, to better understand the \npoverty context of their interventions and thereby improve targeting and designing programs for \npoverty reduction. \n \n3.  Although several definitions of poverty are used in Sri Lanka, no one definition is, \nuniversally adopted by state authorities, to use as a starting point. The problem is compounded \nby the use of different reference points by authors computing poverty lines over the past \ndecades, making the analysis of poverty trends highly problematic. The agencies vested with \nthe primary task of gathering data produce data that is rich and reliable. However, more work \nneeds to be done to develop the capacity to present this data\u2014especially poverty-related \ndata\u2014in ways that meet the poverty information needs of potential clients. In summary, the \nmeeting point between the data producers and data users is less than optimal. \n \n4.  With respect to the north and east, the Government\u2019s capacity to measure and monitor \npoverty has been constrained by the conflict going on for two decades. As a result, gaps in \nknowledge exist, particularly with respect to the micro conditions of inhabitants in the eight \nconflict-affected districts of the north and east. The consensus is that key government agencies \nand cooperating academic/research organizations need to strengthen their capacity to monitor \nand analyze poverty data, as a support to their own programs and as a guide to the aid \ncommunity. \n \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nB.
