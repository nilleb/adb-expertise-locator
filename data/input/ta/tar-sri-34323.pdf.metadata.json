During the 2003 Country Program Confirmation Mission to Sri Lanka, the Government of \nSri Lanka (Government) confirmed its request for Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare the rural electrification and network expansion project.1 The TA is \nincluded in the 2003\u20132005 country strategy program. A fact-finding mission visited Sri Lanka in \nMay 2003 and reached an understanding with the Government regarding the scope, approach, \nand implementation and financing arrangements for the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The power sector in Sri Lanka is undergoing reforms and restructuring in order to \nbecome financially and technically sustainable, and thereby ensure an uninterrupted supply of \nelectricity to meet the national demand at all times. ADB is assisting the Government in the \nrestructuring process2 and is encouraged by the Government\u2019s commitment to reforming the \npower sector. This restructuring is part of a larger undertaking by the Government as stated in \nits recent document,  Regaining Sri Lanka (RSL),3 which outlines the economic policies and \nsector activities of the Government. The RSL calls for substantial increase in economic growth, \nand, through increased activities in the major sectors, the increased economic growth should be \nobtainable. The prerequisite for increased economic activities is an equal development of the \ncountry\u2019s infrastructure to ensure that the economy has room and basic utilities in place to grow.  \n \n3.  Sri Lanka\u2019s power sector has two particular areas that need to be addressed to meet the \nchallenges outlined in RSL: (i) ensuring sufficient generation of electricity, and (ii) increasing the \nelectrification  of  the  nation.  Other  activities,  such  as  expansion  of  the  transmission  and \ndistribution network facilities, are considered to be routine matters as every economy grows. \nRegarding the need for additional power generation, an ADB study concludes that sufficient \npower generation capacity is available for 2003\u20132006.  For  2007\u20132009 the Government is \ncurrently in the bidding phase of the 300 megawatts (MW) Kerewalipitiya power station.  In \naddition, the government requested for expression of interest (EOI) for a 3x300 MW base load \ngeneration facility of which the first phase of 300 MW should become operational in 2009. The \nGovernment received 34 expressions of interest.  The next step for the Government is to issue \nthe request for proposals, which is likely to take place after concluding a related TA from the \nUnited States Trade Development Agency. However, sufficient power generation will be a \nprerequisite for the loan project.  \n \n4.  Over the last decade the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Government have \nplaced a high priority on expansion of the national electricity network to reach most of the \npopulation. The Government\u2019s current goal is to have 80% of the population connected to the \ngrid by 2010. When ADB started its lending for rural electrification, about 40% were connected, \nand  at  the  end  of  2002,  CEB  estimated  that  63%  were  connected.  Furthermore,  the \nGovernment and CEB have been able to secure funding for rural electrification projects from \nbilateral and multilateral sources to reach 72% of the population by the end of 2005. Although \nthe progress of electrification indicates strong commitment, Sri Lanka needs to focus on the \ndetails related to rural electrification. CEB has primarily been focusing on its ability to expand \nthe national grid to an increasing number of villages in the countryside. This has resulted in less \nattention to the actual percentage of households within each newly electrified village. Rough \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 June 2003. \n2  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Loan to the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Power Sector Development Program. Manila. \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2002. Regaining Sri Lanka  \u2013 Connecting to Growth: Poverty Reduction Strategy. \nColombo. ", "2 \nindications show that 45\u201365% of households within a village are connected to the grid. The TA \nwill collect information about the socioeconomic parameters in the villages that (i) have recently \nbeen connected, (ii) are about to be connected, and (iii) could be connected in the future. The \nobjective is to structure financial and technical facilities  so that the village electrification can \nreach 80\u201385% of the households. The population that is being connected at the later stages of \nvillage electrification is likely to be the poorer groups. The poorer households gain relatively \nmore from being connected, in terms of health benefits, lower purchases of substitute energy \nitems, the ability of additional income from work at home, and educational benefits for the \nchildren. Sri Lanka needs to address this issue; however, reliable data is required to develop an \nappropriate approach. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The  TA  will  establish  the  technical,  economic,  and  social  feasibility  of  the  rural \nelectrification and network expansion project and provide the new distribution companies with \ncapacity for preparing similar projects for external financing. \n \n6.  The TA will carry out socioeconomic household surveys, an engineering feasibility study, \na financial feasibility study, and a socioeconomic analysis to determine the most viable projects \nwith the largest poverty reduction impact. The studies will include detailed socioeconomic \nanalyses including the ability of customers to pay and an environmental assessment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will prepare rural  electrification schemes and network expansion through an \nintegrated approach covering the social, economic, financial, and technical components of \nexpanding electrification in Sri Lanka. This will be done by an in-depth assessment of these \nareas,  and  using  an  economic  selection  model  inclusive  of  a  poverty  indicator  per  rural \nelectrification scheme. Particular emphasis will be made to increase the electrification rate in \neach village that is being, or has been connected to the national grid. Sophisticated data is \nneeded concerning the socioeconomic characteristics of the rural areas. The data collected will \nbe used to assist development of, for example, financial arrangements that are attractive to the \nvillage population. Additional individual credit structures need to be developed to attract the \n\u201cmedium poor\u201d to prevail of the electrification of their household. \n \n8.  The  key  activities  will  be  the  socioeconomic  survey  of  the  rural  areas,  and  the \ndissemination  of  the  information  obtained  in  terms  of  infrastructure development, and in \nparticular areas and issues related to rural electrification. The investments in rural electrification \nneed  to  be  repaid  over  time.  The  TA  will  identify  areas  to  reduce  investment  costs  and \ninvestigate cost of supply and tariff structures required to cover the investment costs. Linked to \nthe investment cost, is the need to ensure technological efficiencies so that are minimal losses \nemerge from the rural electrification expansion projects and from existing rural electrification \nnetwork.  \n \n9.  In addition to the Government\u2019s economic growth objective, there is a need to ensure \nthat the north and the east, as the peace process progresses, receive proper infrastructure \nfacilities and reconstruction of power supply. To ensure increased efficiency and availability \nADB,  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  and  World  Bank  have  recently ", "    3 \nconcluded a Needs Analysis,4 which has highlighted the investment requirements also for rural \nelectrification. Although the Government and CEB have commenced rehabilitation work on the \ndistribution network, there is a need to fully understand the socioeconomic parameters for the \npopulation that is now returning to the conflict areas and their views and expectations in terms \nof energy. Electricity must be provided to the zone between the conflict and nonconflict areas, \nwhich did not receive attention during the conflict, as the terrain is difficult to work in even during \npeaceful  conditions.  This  is  needed  to  ensure  that  Sri  Lanka  has  an  even  geographic \ndistribution of electrification projects, and to emphasize rural economic growth as one of the \npillars of national economic growth \n \n10.  The tariff linked to rural electrification must and will be analyzed through the TA, in \ngreater detail than most tariff studies in the past as the TA proposes to segregate the rural \nelectrification tariff from the overall retail tariff usually referred to as the average consumer tariff. \nThe structure of the tariff must be defined so that it ensures protection and relief for poor \nconsumers on parity or less compared with substitute energy sources. Should the Government \nseek  to  support  the  rural  population  or,  more  specifically,  the  poorer  consumers  through \nsubsidies, such financial assistance should be made fully transparent and incorporated through \nthe annual national budget. \n \n11.  Not discounting the recent efforts of CEB and  Lanka Electricity Company (Pte) Ltd. \n(LECO) to reduce losses from the distribution network, the distribution loss reduction programs \nneed to be fully implemented. The technical areas of rural electrification cause concerns in \nterms of quality of the electricity delivered and line losses from the technical solutions adopted. \nIn the case of Sri Lanka there is a need to take stock of the current network consisting of both \nageing and more recent assets, analyze its weaknesses, and bring viable solutions for approval \nand implementation. The TA seeks to address the technical sides of rural electrification and \nproposes solutions for incorporation into future rural electrification investment projects.  \n \n12.  The Government's implementation of the power sector reforms will create five new \ndistribution companies that will be involved in rural electrification projects as they all have rural \ngeographic areas that are awaiting electrification. The TA, through preparing and implementing \nseminars and workshops for the new distribution companies, aims to ensure full dissemination \nof the data gathered as well as the technical methodology adopted for expanding the national \ngrid and related facilities. There will also be a need to evaluate the delivery mechanism for \nfuture financial assistance to the individual companies in the power sector. This assistance \ncould be through funding from development agencies, the private sector, and the national \nbudget. \n \n13.  In an earlier power program ADB assisted CEB to develop an economic model solely \nused for selection of rural electrification schemes based on economic criteria. This economic \nmodel ensured that a transparent and objective methodology was used in the selection of \nschemes. The model should now be reviewed from a historic point of view to ensure its future \napplicability. In addition, the Government has adopted its poverty reduction strategy, which calls \nfor additional focus on poverty alleviation. The economic model has elements of a poverty ratio \nwithin its context, but the poverty indicator needs to be evaluated and expanded to ensure \nbetter targeting of the rural electrification schemes. The TA needs to address the selection \nmethodology and technical (system) parameters for project selection. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.  Small Scale Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of  Sri Lanka for Needs \nAssessment. Manila. Two final reports were produced: Assessment of Needs in the Conflict Affected Areas, which \ncovers the North and East, and Assessment of Conflict-Related Needs in the Districts of Puttalam, Plonnaruwa, \nAnuradhapura, and Moneragala, which are the four border districts. ", "4 \n14.  As the sector is in the process of unbundling the CEB and LECO, the data gathered \nthrough the TA must be disseminated among the new companies and stakeholders. The TA \nproposes to conduct a number of workshops and seminars for the new distribution companies, \nthe Public Utilities Commission as part of its regulatory functions, at the provincial and village \nlevel, and for the policy makers. The improved data and its related analysis should improve the \nunderstanding of rural electrification in Sri Lanka, and be timely input for the policy makers to \nunderstand how further efforts could be structured and supported. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, consisting of $473,500 in \nforeign exchange cost and $276,500 equivalent in local currency cost. The entire foreign \nexchange cost of $473,500 and $126,500 equivalent of local currency cost, totaling $600,000 \nequivalent, will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government \nthrough  the  Ministry  of  Power  and  Energy  (MOPE)  will  finance  $150,000  equivalent,  for \ncounterpart and support staff, seminars and workshops, and office facilities. The detailed cost \nestimates are given in Appendix 1. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MOPE will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The distribution companies that will be \nestablished under the restructured power sector will be the implementing agencies. Each \ndistribution company will establish a rural electrification unit that will be directly responsible for \nthe project implementation. MOPE has nominated the director, power sector to be responsible \nfor  overall  coordination  among  distribution  companies,  the  consultants,  ADB,  and  other \nGovernment and nongovernment agencies. The TA will be carried out by a consulting firm in \ntwo  overlapping  phases.  The  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selection \nand engagement of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for the consulting \nservices are presented in Appendix 2. \n \n17.  Phase 1.  The TA\u2019s first phase will consist of socioeconomic household surveys and \neconometric assessment of the corresponding results. Phase 1 will be carried out by two \ninternational consultants supported by domestic consultants. The international consultants will \nwork closely with the economist who will be recruited under phase 2 of the TA, and will use the \nfindings of the surveys to design and select subprojects based on socioeconomic and poverty \nimpact through adjustments to the economic selection model currently in use. The analysis will \ninclude an assessment of the distribution of benefits, with special emphasis on the poor's ability \nto benefit. The survey findings will be used by the transmission company\u2019s dispatch center for \nload forecast, demand management, and design of subprojects. Household-level impacts will be \ndetermined through the survey and participatory approaches will be used to capture community-\nlevel impacts and mechanisms through which the impacts occur. A total of 4.4 person-months \nare  envisaged  for  the  international  consultants  and  17.5  person-months  for  the  domestic \nconsultants.  \n \n18.  One economist and one statistician, with suitable academic qualifications in statistics \nand economics will be recruited as international consultants. They will (i) be experienced in \ndesigning and conducting socioeconomic surveys and analyzing poverty; (ii) have strong skills \nin applying econometric techniques and other statistical methods; (iii) be familiar with using \nparticipatory methods to analyze the process of change to complement statistical analysis; and \n(iv) have proven ability to work in developing countries, preferably in Asia. ", "    5 \n \n19.  The  international  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  designing  and  analyzing  the \nsocioeconomic survey and will collaborate closely with local consultants, ensuring that analytical \nskills are transferred to the extent possible. The international consultants will collaborate with \nthe consultants conducting the economic feasibility under phase 2, and will spend approximately \n1.4 person-months in the field on an intermittent basis. At the end of the study, the consultants \nwill conduct a workshop to present the findings to all stakeholders. \n \n20.  Phase  2.    The  second  phase  of  the  TA  will  form  the  basis  for  an  ensuing  rural \nelectrification and network expansion project. The work will be carried out by well-qualified \ninternational and domestic consultants. Phase 2 is expected to commence in March 2004 and \nbe completed by the end of January 2005. Ten person-months of international and 8.75 \nperson-months of domestic consultancy are envisaged for phase 2, bringing the overall TA total \nfor international consultants to 14.40 person-months and  for domestic consultants to 26.25 \nperson-months. International consulting services will be required in rural electrification system \nplanning (including load forecast and power system analysis), power distribution planning, \ntransmission  and  distribution  design,  economic  and  financial  analysis,  project  evaluation, \nsocioeconomic studies, and environmental studies. This includes a specific review of tariffs of \nthe rural electrification subsector. Domestic consulting services will be for field surveys in \nconjunction with the socioeconomic studies and surveys to determine the engineering line \nroutes. The consultants will provide seminars and training courses under the TA. \n \n21.  The two phases of the TA will commence in March 2004 and be completed by the end of \nJanuary 2005. For phase 1, the individual consultants will (i) submit an inception report, within 3 \nweeks of commencement of services; (ii) a draft final report, within 3 months of commencement \nof services; and (iii) the final report, within 2 weeks of receipt of comments on the draft final \nreport by ADB and the Government. For phase 2, the consortium will submit an inception report \nfor  ADB's  and  the  Government\u2019s  approval  within  3  weeks  of  the  commencement  of  the \nassignment. The report will indicate the initial findings, proposed methodology, and timetable for \nthe remainder of the consulting services under phase 2. An interim report will be submitted for \nADB's and the Government's approval within 3 months of commencement of the assignment. A \nsecond interim report will be provided within 7 months of commencement. A draft final report will \nbe submitted within 10 months of commencement of the assignment. The final report will be \nsubmitted within 1 month after receipt of comments on the draft final report by  ADB and the \nGovernment. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for preparing the Rural Electrification and Network Expansion \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The statistician will, in collaboration with the economist, complete the following: \n \n(i)  Design a household and a community-level survey in collaboration with domestic \nconsultants,1 the Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE), and other relevant \nGovernment  of  Sri  Lanka  agencies.  The  surveys  will  be  subject  to  random \nsampling  and  cover  areas  under  previous  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-\nfinanced  rural  electrification  projects,  areas  to  be  electrified  under  the \nGovernment's rural electrification project and the proposed Rural Electrification \nand Network Expansion Project, and control areas. The surveys will be used to \nassess the benefits of rural electrification with and without the proposed Project. \nThe  household  survey  will  cover  approximately  3,000  observations  and  the \ncommunity-level survey will cover all villages under the household survey. \n(ii)  In collaboration with domestic consultants, design questionnaires that will be \nsubject to field-testing and approval by ADB before survey implementation. The \nsurvey will take into account activities to strengthening the National Statistical \nSystem, to ensure coordination and comparability between the electrification \nimpact survey and the forthcoming living standards measurement survey. \n(iii)  Include the relevant characteristics of commercial activities in the surveys. \n(iv)  Provide  guidance  to  and  assist  domestic  consultants  in  training  of  field \nnumerators. \n(v)  In collaboration with domestic consultants, check the raw data, adjust them for \ninaccuracies, and prepare data sets for analysis. \n(vi)  Estimate the number of poor households in accordance with the household \nincome  and  expenditure  survey  2002  and  provide  related  identification \ninformation. Based on this information, propose a set of targeting criteria to be \nused for identification of the poor. \n(vii)  In collaboration with the economist, provide a distributional analysis of energy-\nrelated variables, income, and expenditure. \n(viii)  Assist  the  economist  in  relevant  work  for  the  econometric  and  quantitative \nanalysis and in the reporting. \n \n2.  The economist will, in collaboration with the statistician, complete the following: \n \n(i)  Review work on poverty and energy and impacts of rural electrification. Provide a \ndetailed  analytical  and  empirical  framework  for  analyzing  the  distributional \nimpacts of rural electrification. The framework will include a derived demand \nmodel,  for  conducting  the  econometric  analysis.  The  empirical  analysis  will \ndistinguish between consumer categories, including one category for the poor. \n(ii)  Establish consumer categories and clear identification criteria. Conduct demand \nforecasts  and  impact  analyses  for  various  categories  of  consumers.  The \nanalyses will distinguish between long-term and short-term impacts and between \nincremental and nonincremental benefits of rural electrification. \n                                                 \n1  Domestic consultants with expertise in conducting surveys and participatory approaches will be recruited.  \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \n(iii)  Estimate the ability and willingness to pay of the consumer categories.

Analyze the impacts of load shedding and voltage \nfluctuations. \n(vi)  Analyze the distributional impacts of electrification and the share of benefits \naccruing  to  the  poor  from  rural  electrification  and  the  potential  benefits  of \nsustainable rural electrification and the proposed Project. \n(vii)  Prepare a proposal for the underlying variables for the economic analysis of \nsubprojects  and  otherwise  assist  consultants  with  data  requirements  under \nphase 2 of the technical assistance. \n(viii)  Provide guidance to and assist domestic consultants in conducting participatory \nassessments at the village and community levels to determine processes through \nwhich  the  impacts  occur.  The  participatory  assessments  will  be  used  to \ncomplement  quantitative  analysis  and  include,  to  the  extent  possible,  intra-\nhousehold impacts. \n(ix)  Conduct a workshop to present the analyses and findings. \n(x)  In collaboration with the consultants for economic and financial analyses in \nphase 2, design a follow-up survey, including cost estimates, to monitor the \nimpacts of rural electrification. \n \n2.  Reporting \n3.  The international consultants will produce the following reports for ADB and MOPE: \n \n(i)  The inception report will be submitted to ADB and MOPE within 3 weeks of \ncommencement of services and before the survey commences. The report will \nprovide  all  relevant  information  on  the  survey  designs,  questionnaires, and \nimplementation schedule. The inception report will review the work on poverty \nand energy and impacts of rural electrification, and propose an analytical and \nempirical  framework  for  testing  the  impact  hypothesis.  The  framework  and \nquestionnaires will be subject to approval by ADB. \n(ii)  The draft final report (due 3 months after commencement of services) will be \nsubmitted to ADB and MOPE after an initial assessment of the data has been \nconducted and will include an update of the progress of the study. The report will \nproduce relevant statistical information, preliminary econometric results and initial \ninformation on the participatory assessments. The consultants will, in advance of \nthe draft final report, submit the primary data sets to ADB and MOPE. \n(iii)  The final report, to be submitted to ADB and MOPE within 2 weeks of receipt of \ncomments, will include a full report on the impacts of electrification and the \nproposal for benefit assessment for the economic analysis of subprojects.

Phase 2 (international consultants, 10 person-months; and domestic consultants, 8.75 \nperson-months) \n1.  Engineering Aspects \n4.  The consultants will complete the following: \n \n(i)  Review the status of ongoing and prior rural electrification projects undertaken by \nCeylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the rural electrification program prepared by \nCEB for the next 5 years. \n(ii)  Review the results of CEB's prefeasibility studies in which villages in all the \nprovinces  have  been  identified  for  electrification.  Treat  the  scope  of  work \ninvolved  in  connecting  the  households  in  each  block  as  constituting  one \nsubproject.  The  consultants  may  combine  blocks  into  larger  subprojects  as \nrequired, and establish the expected load forecast per subproject. This will be \ndone in conjunction with the economic analysis.  \n(iii)  Carry out engineering line surveys, check line lengths, confirm existing loads, \nand check estimates of future line loadings prepared by CEB. Estimate the \noverall cost of connecting consumers and estimate the cost for each district, \nusing international unit prices. \n(iv)  Determine the least-cost power system expansion needed to electrify the villages \nand households under consideration, giving careful attention to the location and \nsize of transformers and associated facilities. Review the system optimization \nrecommendations  made  under  other  assistance  projects  and,  to  the  extent \npracticable, incorporate them into optimizing the design of the extensions to the \nnational power system so that a true least-cost solution is achieved. This will be \ndemonstrated by calculations. \n(v)  Prepare  drawings,  detailed  design,  technical  specifications,  and  draft  bid \ndocuments, taking into account CEB\u2019s and the transmission company\u2019s system \nplanning criteria, technical standards, and standard specification equipment. The \nbid documents will follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement Under ADB Loans. \n(vi)  Make the analyses (e.g., load flow, fault level studies, etc.) in association with \nselected counterpart staff so that effective and sustained technology transfer is \nachieved. Use computer software programs already in the possession of CEB \nand provide additional programs as required. \n \n2.  Environmental Issues \n5.  The consultants will undertake an environmental assessment of the proposed project \nand provide an initial environmental examination with their summaries, in accordance with \nADB's  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  Include  development  of  appropriate \nenvironmental frameworks, if required. \n \n3.  Social Analysis \n6.  The consortium will provide a poverty and social development specialist to undertake a \ndetailed social analysis of the Project in accordance with ADB's Handbook for Incorporation of \nSocial Dimensions in Projects. The consultants will complete the following: \n \n(i)  Present  a  report  incorporating  a  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  project  area, \ndescribing  the  participatory  processes  (including  beneficiary  participation  in \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nproject design) and addressing, in particular, the following issues associated with \nthe Project: poverty reduction, gender, indigenous peoples, land acquisition, and \ninvoluntary resettlement. \n(ii)  Recommend specific social measures to be incorporated into the project design, \nincluding but not limited to, alignments of poles, widths of ease ways, etc. Take \ninto consideration safety and employment opportunities for the very poor affected \nby the Project. \n(iii)  Specify the amount of land to be acquired for project construction and assess \nany likely impacts on housing and livelihoods. Review measures to minimize \nadverse  effects  and  prepare  mitigating  measures.  Include compensation at \nreplacement rates for loss and rehabilitation measures if livelihood or houses are \nat risk. Prepare a resettlement plan consistent with ADB's policy on resettlement, \nincluding the following: \n(a)  a database of project-affected people, prepared through a socioeconomic \nsurvey; \n(b)  a survey of losses of houses, agricultural lands, businesses, and income \nopportunities; \n(c)  an entitlement matrix for all project-affected people; \n(d)  relocation options for those who may lose houses and or enterprises \nstructures, as required; \n(e)  collection of data on the host population within the zone of influence, if \nrelocation will be required; \n(f)  gender planning issues; \n(g)  income restoration programs; \n(h)  project-specific resettlement policy; \n(i)  comprehensive resettlement budget and a resettlement plan, prepared in \naccordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Handbook \non Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice; \n \n7.  The requirements are indicative as the full scope of the ensuing project to be financed by \nADB is not yet known. However, involuntary resettlement is expected to be minimal as most line \nextensions are intended to follow existing roads and extensions to existing substations are \npresently envisaged. \n \n4.  Economic and Financial Analysis \n8.  The consultants will do the following: Review the current cost of supply and tariff \nstructure for rural electrification, taking into account the results of previous assistance in the \narea of tariff development and establishment. The objective is to establish the true financial \nperformance of the rural electrification segment of the overall power market.  Analyze the \neconomic  and  financial  implications  of  the  Project  on  the  overall  financial  viability  of  the \ndistribution  companies  under  different  cost/revenue  scenarios.  Determine  the  adequacy  of \ntariffs, propose adjustments necessary to maintain individual companies' financial viability, and \nestimate the magnitude of rural electrification subsidies required under various tariff scenarios.  \nAssess the lifeline tariff, as part of the analysis. \n \n9.  Determine the full cost of connections and for providing electrification kits. Estimate the \namount of subsidies needed and distinguish between subsidy allocations for the poor and non-\npoor under the current connection charge structure. \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n10.  In  collaboration  with  the  consultant  engineers,  the  Government,  and  the  power \ncompanies, define a set of criteria for identifying subprojects that potentially are economically \nand  technically  viable.  After  approval  by  ADB,  implement  the  criteria  to  define  individual \nsubprojects for the Project. \n \n11.  Set up and computerize an economic model to analyzing the poverty impact and the \neconomic and financial rates of return for individual subprojects. The demand and benefit \nassessment will distinguish between consumer groups, with a special category for consumers \nbelow the poverty line. \n \n12.  Conduct a seminar to inform power sector staff about subproject definition, the purpose \nof economic analysis of subprojects, and the basic functioning of the model. Following the \nseminar, conduct a series of in-depth training sessions with at least two distribution company \nstaff, using the model for analyzing individual subprojects and changing underlying assumptions \nas needed to ensure sustainability of economic analysis of subprojects. \n \n13.  Conduct a full economic and financial assessment of the Project in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Include a calculating the poverty \nimpact ratios. Conduct sensitivity and risk analyses of perceived risks and assess the economic, \npoverty, and financial implications of different tariff and subsidy scenarios. \n \n14.  In collaboration with the economist in phase 1, (i) design a follow-up survey, including \ncost estimates, to monitor the impacts of rural electrification, and (ii) design updates of the \neconomic model for reassessing subprojects. \n \n5.  Reporting \n15.  The consultants for phase 2 will assist the consultants for phase 1 to summarize the \nimpacts of electrification and the proposal for benefit assessment so that they can be published \nas a formal ADB report. \n \n16.  Similarly, in their final report, the consultants for phase 2 will prepare a summary of the \nfindings of phase 2 of the TA. The summary will be prepared for publication as a formal ADB \nreport. \n \n17.  The consultants will prepare a project framework for the proposed rural electrification \nand network expansion project as per ADB\u2019s specifications. \n \n18.  The consultants will prepare a draft project administration manual in accordance with \nADB\u2019s specifications, with due consideration to performance indicators for the proposed Project. \n \n19.  The final report for phase 2 will be prepared following the format of an ADB report and \nrecommendation  of  the  President.  The  final  report  will  contain  the  environmental  impact \nassessment and social analysis in the format prescribed in ADB handbooks. The final report \nshould include the project administration memorandum, with details on procurement, contract \npackaging, consultant selection, and implementation schedules. As a minimum, the logical \nframework, the summary initial environmental examination, the summary of the initial social \nassessment, the summary resettlement plan, and the financial and economic analyses of the \nProject will be prepared so that they may be readily attached as appendixes to the Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board that will be prepared by ADB, based on the \nfindings of the TA. \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R325-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20040218101254Z", "Title": "R325-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040226091013+08'00'"}}
