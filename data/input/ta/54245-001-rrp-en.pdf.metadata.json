THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Palau for the Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support (HEALS) Program \nunder the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO).1 \n \n2.  The HEALS Program will support the government\u2019s response to the potentially devastating \nhealth and economic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including though increased \nhealth  sector  spending  and  sustained  funding  for  social  protection  programs.  Further,  the \ngovernment is providing social assistance to the unemployed and financial relief for private firms \nthrough its Coronavirus Relief One-Stop Shop Program.2 Overall, COVID-19 response measures \nremain within the context of a sound and sustainable fiscal framework. Palau\u2019s compliance with \nthe access criteria for the CPRO is summarized in Table 1 (detailed in Appendix 4).  \n \nTable 1: Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support Program Compliance with  \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response Option Access Criteria \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Assessment \n1.  Adverse impact of  Palau\u2019s economy is projected to contract by 9.5% in FY2020 and 12.8% in FY2021 \nexogenous shock  because  of  global  travel  restrictions  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic. \nIf restricted travel extends to the end of FY2020, annual arrivals are expected to fall by \n49.9% to less than 46,000, with a loss of more than 3,100 jobs (comprising about 27% \nof the total workforce), of which 1,200 job losses are expected to affect female \nemployees. As a result, the basic needs poverty rate is forecast to increase to 29.0% \nof households by the end of FY2021, up from 19.4% in 2014. \n2.  Countercyclical  The first supplementary budget was passed in March 2020, allocating $6.9 million for \ndevelopment  emergency supplies, additional screening, and testing, and bridging revenue shortfalls \nexpenditure  to maintain critical public services. A second supplementary budget in April included a \n$20 million countercyclical development expenditure program (the Coronavirus Relief \nOne-Stop Shop Program) providing (i) loans to affected businesses, (ii) unemployment \nbenefits, (iii) wage funding for temporary employment schemes by the public sector \nand  nongovernment  organizations,  and  (iv)  expanded  lifeline  utility  subsidies. \nAdditional funding was also made available for the Palau Red Cross and education \nand  aid  to  private  schools.  The  second  supplementary  budget  also  estimates \nsubstantial revenue shortfalls\u2014$21 million in FY2020 and $24 million in FY2021\u2014and \nauthorizes up to $60 million in borrowing to finance continuation of essential public \nservices, particularly health and social protection.  \n3.  Preshock record of  Palau recorded fiscal surpluses (averaging 3.1% of GDP) during FY2011\u2013FY2019. \ngenerally sound  During the tourism boom, Palau saved the bulk of surpluses and built fiscal buffers \nmacroeconomic  equivalent to 11.2% of GDP. In FY2019, prior to COVID-19, total public debt was the \nmanagement  equivalent of about 32.5% of GDP and was rated sustainable by the IMF. \n4.  Structural reforms  Palau has instituted COVID-19 response measures including (i) activating the Ministry \nof Health\u2019s Emergency Operations Center, (ii) health screening all international arrivals \nsince  late-January  and  full  border  closure  from  26  March  2020,  (iii)  issuing  a \nCertification of Unavoidable Public Health Emergency, and (iv) COVID-19 testing \ntargeting frontline health workers and at-risk groups to effectively minimize the risk of \nan  outbreak  in  Palau.  Other  system-strengthening  measures  include  installing \nadditional ventilators at Belau National Hospital, preparing alternative care sites to \nprovide critical health services should any suspected cases be detected, paying \novertime and hazard pay rates to frontline health workers, and activating a 24-hour \nCOVID-19 hotline for public inquiries.  \n5. Debt sustainability  The size of the total financing envelope necessary to counter the heavy economic and \nfiscal impacts of COVID-19 are expected to push Palau\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio to \n46.4% in FY2020 and 66.9% in FY2021. However, ADB\u2019s DSA shows that with \nsustained recovery, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio can revert to the pre-COVID-19 level \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

Further, the program is not seen to add significantly to the \ngovernment\u2019s annual debt service obligations. The ADB DSA therefore concludes that \npublic debt remains sustainable and fiscal vulnerabilities are contained.   \n6.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Prompt response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of timely measures, there \nhave been no confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 in Palau. The Ministry of Health (MOH) \nactivated its Emergency Operations Center on 22 January 2020 to spearhead preparedness and \nresponse efforts, focused on minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission from international \ntravelers. On 23 January 2020, the government started implementing health screenings for all air \nand sea arrivals, before the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak as a \npublic health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. After the WHO declared \nCOVID-19 a global pandemic on 12 March 2020, the MOH issued a Certification of Unavoidable \nPublic Health Emergency on 17 March 2020, through which additional precautions were imposed, \nincluding  a  mandatory  14-day  self-quarantine  period  for  travelers  arriving  from  COVID-19-\naffected countries as well as temporary closure of schools and senior citizen centers and \nimplementation of broader social distancing guidelines. All commercial travel to Palau was \nsuspended by late March, while limited private or chartered flights were permitted. As of 15 July \n2020, 173 flights and 57 vessels had been screened, covering 17,016 passengers.3 Palau started \non-site testing for COVID-19 in mid-April, initially targeting frontline health workers, the elderly, \nand those with pre-existing health conditions.  \n \n4.  Inadequate health care system. The Belau National Hospital, the main health facility, \nhas a capacity of about 80 beds, with four intensive care unit beds and five isolation rooms with \nnegative air flow.4 Despite reducing nonessential services and clinics in preparation for receiving \nand caring for critically ill or suspected COVID-19 cases, the estimated potential requirement for \nhospital beds is about five times the current capacity.5 Approximately 5% of all hospitalizations, \nor possibly 94 cases for Palau, are expected to require ventilators, intensive care unit beds, and \nisolation wards\u2014the hospital currently only has 25 ventilators. Palau has a high-skilled health \nprofessionals  density  of  7.20  per  1,000  people,  above  the  Sustainable  Development  Goal \nminimum threshold of 4.45 per 1,000 people, but the majority of the workforce require additional \ntraining in response to a pandemic, additionally the higher risk of infection can also rapidly deplete \nhealth workforce capacity.    \n  \n5.  Tourism drives economy. Palau is among the most tourism-driven economies in the \nPacific, with annual tourism receipts reaching the equivalent of 40%\u201350% of annual gross \n \n3  A weekly flight from Guam remains in operation, carrying mostly airmail and cargo. \n4  Health services are also available through four community centers and another four satellite dispensaries. \n5  Projections are based on Palau\u2019s estimated 2020 population of 18,797 (81% in urban areas), with assumptions of a \n10% infection rate with preparedness measures, 20% of infected people requiring hospitalization, and 5% of \nhospitalizations being severe and requiring ventilators. \n ", "3 \ndomestic product (GDP). However, the tourism industry has struggled in recent years. From a \npeak of nearly 170,000 tourists (for a tourist\u2013resident ratio of 9.5:1, among the highest globally) \nin fiscal year (FY) 2015, arrivals declined to less than 90,000 by FY2019.6 The decline was \nprecipitated by a drought that affected water supply in hotels and resorts, while also decimating \nthe jellyfish population in Palau\u2019s famed Jellyfish Lake, thereby discouraging some tourists from \nvisiting. Arrivals were further dented by restrictions on tour groups from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina.7 Weak demand led to reductions in flight services, further decreasing tourist arrivals.  \n \n6.  COVID-19 impacts tourism. A tourist profile heavily tilted toward source markets in East \nAsia\u2014in contrast to the dominance of tourism from Australia and New Zealand for south Pacific \ndestinations\u2014meant that Palau experienced the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic \nbefore most of its regional peers. The People\u2019s Republic of China is the largest tourist market, \nwith a 32% share as of FY2019, followed by Japan (22%); Taipei,China (16%); and the Republic \nof Korea (13%). From October 2019 to January 2020 (the first 4 months of Palau\u2019s fiscal year), \nvisitor arrivals were already equivalent to 46.4% of FY2019 full-year arrivals.8 However, the \nCOVID-19 pandemic saw total arrivals fall by 43% year-on-year in February 2020 and by 70% in \nMarch 2020. Inbound tourism is now expected to decline for a fifth consecutive year, with annual \narrivals expected to fall by 49.9% to less than 46,000. Further, arrivals could be below 10,000 in \nFY2021 if travel remains restricted until the end of fiscal year and rebuilds only slowly thereafter. \nSuch an extended scenario can occur if, for example, international travel trends do not revert to \nnormal\u2014with or without formal restrictions\u2014until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available. \n \n7.  Economic contraction deepens. The ongoing tourism downturn has translated into \nsuccessive economic contractions during FY2016\u2013FY2019, with the exception of FY2018 when \nthe economy was boosted by the advent of high-speed internet services.9 An independent \nassessment commissioned by the Government of Palau projects that the economy may contract \nby 9.5% in FY2020 and another 12.8% in FY2021 if international travel remains restricted over \nthis 2-year period.10 The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) macroeconomic projections as of June \n2020  align  with  this  outlook.11 The  government\u2019s  COVID-19  response  plans  are  prudently \nanchored on this extended scenario, even allowing for the option of waiting until a COVID-19 \nvaccine is available in the market before reopening Palau to international tourism. \n \n8.  Unprecedented  economic losses.  While  the  extensive  precautions will  help  avoid \npotentially catastrophic direct health impacts from the pandemic, they can also exact severe \neconomic costs. The depth of projected economic contraction is nearly double that seen during \nthe global financial and economic crisis of 2008\u20132009 that also resulted in drastically reduced \ntourist arrivals in Palau. The cumulative FY2020\u2013FY2021 economic contractions projected under \nthe extended scenario will push per capita nominal incomes back to below the FY2012 level.  \n \n9.  Significant job losses. The pre-pandemic tourism downturn already took its toll on the \nlabor market, with employment falling by 1.7% in FY2019. This was the first decline since FY2011 \nand was mainly felt in tourism-linked areas including hotels and restaurants, transportation, and \n \n6  Palau National Government website: https://www.palaugov.pw/visitor-arrivals/ (accessed 09 July 2020). \n7  Tourists from the People\u2019s Republic of China visiting Palau mainly travel via Hong Kong, China as Palau is not a \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China-approved destination. \n8  ADB estimates based on data from footnote 6. \n9  Through ADB. 2015.

Asian Development Outlook 2020 Supplement: Lockdown, Loosening, and Asia\u2019s Growth Prospects. \nManila (June). \n ", "4 \nretail trade. An extended border closure is projected to lead to the loss more than 3,100 jobs\u2014or \nmore than one-quarter of formal employment\u2014by the end of FY2021. Over two-thirds of job \nlosses are expected to arise from the closure of businesses with ties to the now-stagnant tourism \nindustry. Beyond tourism-linked sectors (29% of formal employment), impacts can extend to \nconstruction (7%) through project delays, with a lower risk of job losses in the public sector (40%). \nWomen  comprise  38.3%  of  total  employees  in  Palau,  with  greater  representation  in  the \ngovernment and finance sectors where the proportion of female employees exceeds 50.0%. \nFurther, 98% of women working for wages and salaries are employed in the services sector, \nwhere most tourism-linked businesses operate, such that around 39.1% of total employment \nlosses because of the COVID-19 crisis, or about 1,200 jobs, will affect female workers.    \n \n10.  Countercyclical development expenditure program. The government\u2019s countercyclical \ndevelopment expenditure program encompasses support to the health sector, sustaining critical \npublic services and social assistance, and the CROSS Program for affected businesses and \nworkers. The government passed the first supplementary budget for FY2020 immediately after \nthe declaration of a public health emergency in mid-March (para. 3). This allocated an additional \n$6.0 million from general fund reserves to bridge revenue shortfalls and finance continuation of \ngovernment services and employment, and allocated a further $0.9 million to the Hospital Trust \nFund for emergency supplies and additional screening, testing, and monitoring of COVID-19 to \nkeep Palau free from the virus. As global travel restrictions took effect, it became clear that a \nlarger fiscal response package was necessary to provide further support not only for health \nservices but also for businesses and workers in the private sector experiencing sudden loss of \nincome. Thus, a second FY2020 supplementary budget was enacted in late April allocating an \nadditional $22.2 million in government spending. The bulk of the new spending\u2014$20 million or \nequivalent to 8% of GDP\u2014supports the CROSS Program for private businesses and employees \naffected by reduced economic activity because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outside the CROSS \nProgram, funding of $0.5 million was also made available for the Palau Red Cross, education aid \nto  private  schools,  and  consular  assistance  for  citizens  stranded  abroad.  The  second \nsupplementary budget further identified expected revenue shortfalls of $21 million in FY2020 and \n$24 million in FY2021, which are addressed through authorization of up to $60 million in additional \nborrowing to finance continuing government operations through to the end of FY2021.  \n \n11.  Health sector financing to boost COVID-19 preparedness. The MOH is budgeted to \nreceive  8.8%  of  the  total  budget  allocations  for  FY2020  to  further  strengthen  monitoring \ncapacities, including the continuation of health screenings for all international passenger arrivals \nand roll-out of COVID-19 testing (para. 3). The Belau National Hospital is also implementing \nscreenings at all points of entry to safeguard patients from possible infection. The MOH aims to \nprovide at least 96,000 on-island polymerase chain reaction test kits. The MOH also has Abbott \nID NOW machines for rapid testing and is awaiting further test kits. Overtime and hazard pay to \nfrontline health workers was authorized in mid-April. The MOH has also activated a 24-hour \nCOVID-19 hotline for public queries. Alternative care sites (e.g., the Palau National Gymnasium \nand outer islands hotels) are being prepared to provide makeshift capacity for screening and \nquarantine, as well as critical health services should any suspected cases be detected. \n \n12.  Social assistance for vulnerable groups. The supplementary budgets ringfence funding \nfor the Ministry of Community and Cultural Affairs (MCCA)\u2014budgeted at $1.6 million or 1.3% of \ntotal FY2020 allocations\u2014particularly for critical social assistance programs specifically targeting \nvulnerable groups, which support about 3,300 beneficiaries.12 These programs are (i) social \n \n12 Social protection programs with sustained funding are summarized in Summary of Existing Social Protection \nPrograms by the Government (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "5 \nassistance for the elderly, including a center for socialization with daily transport, meals, cultural \nworkshops, and income-generating activities; (ii) financial assistance of $75 or $100 per month to \npeople with physical or mental disabilities; (iii) a school feeding program for children; (iv) a special \neducation program for children (up to age 21 years) with disabilities; (v) a preschool program for \nchildren 3\u20135 years of age from lower-income households; (vi) a child day care program targeting \nlow-income working families, students who are parents, and single mothers; (vii) an apprentice \nprogram involving a 12-month training period on construction skills; and (viii) a national health \ninsurance voucher program for up to 50 uninsured individuals aged 18\u201359 years in need of \nmedical referrals. Most of these programs have been in place for decades and have well-\nfunctioning systems for beneficiary selection, support implementation, and monitoring. \n \n13.  Coronavirus Relief One-Stop Shop Program support to the private sector and \nunemployed. In response to the substantial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses \nand workers, the government through the Ministry of Finance (MOF) established the $20 million \nCROSS Program to provide temporary assistance to the private sector.13 Migrant workers as well \nas self-employed people and informal businesses (e.g., those engaged in small-scale retail selling \nof food items) may also qualify for support.14 Direct relief measures under the CROSS Program \ninclude the following: \n(i)  Loans to and/or deferred payments by businesses. The MOF is facilitating \nconcessional  or  interest-free  lending  to  businesses  through  the  National \nDevelopment Bank of Palau. The MOF expects up to 112 employers to apply for \nthese  loans,  which  can  cover  businesses\u2019  fixed  costs  and  possibly  finance \nimprovements in tourism facilities. Based on the latest Household Income and \nExpenditure Survey, it is expected that about 16% of business loan applications \nwill be from businesses or enterprises owned by women.15 Loans will be provided \nwith 10-year terms, with annual interest payments of 2% starting by the third year, \nand principal repayments only due from the fourth year until maturity. Priority \nfunding is for loans that cover businesses\u2019 fixed costs, capped at $30,000 every 3 \nmonths per employer. Loans of up to $250,000 for improving tourism facilities may \nthen be financed with any funds remaining from the CROSS Program\u2019s allocations \nfor concessional lending to businesses. Employers\u2019 taxes payable and social \nsecurity contributions can be deferred with MOF approval (footnote 2).      \n(ii)  Unemployment benefit. This benefit supports workers whose employment has \nbeen terminated, suspended, or reduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It \nis estimated that 38.3% of those newly unemployed (over 1,250 individuals) will be \nwomen (para. 9). Qualified individuals may receive $100 (i) per week, if they are \nunemployed and generating no income; (ii) per two-week period, if their monthly \nworking hours and earnings have been reduced by at least 50%; or (iii) per month, \nif monthly work hours and earnings are cut by more than 25% but less than 50%.16 \nReceipt of assistance for more than 1 month requires proof that the individual \nattempted to find a job but has been unsuccessful. Unemployment benefits are \naccessed by applying through the MCCA. \n \n13  With national elections scheduled for November 2020, the second FY2020 supplementary budget funds relief \nmeasures included in the CROSS Program through the end of the current administration\u2019s term in January 2021. \nThis provides the incoming administration the flexibility to refine the program as needed upon assumption of office. \n14  Social protection aspects of the CROSS Program are summarized in Summary of Social Protection Measures in \nGovernment\u2019s COVID-19 Response Package (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15  Palau Office of Planning and Statistics. 2015.

These schemes provide wage funding for \ntemporary  jobs  programs  administered  by  public  sector  and  nongovernment \norganizations.  Temporary  jobs  are  particularly  targeted  toward  nonresident \nworkers, who may apply for transfer of employment with an understanding that \ntheir original employers will either rehire them once businesses reopen or arrange \nfor  their  repatriation  to  their  home  country  when  travel  becomes  possible.17 \nTemporary employment programs will comply with Palau\u2019s minimum wage, with \npriority  funding  given  for  job  creation  in  key  sectors  including  care  for  the \nvulnerable  population,  environmental  protection,  and  tourism  enhancement. \nQualified workers may apply for temporary jobs through the Division of Labor of \nthe Ministry of Justice. A temporary workforce coordinating committee, cochaired \nby the minister of the MCCA and the chair of the Palau Visitors Authority, will \ncoordinate and prioritize projects eligible for wage funding.  \n(iv)  Lifeline utility services. The lifeline electricity, water, and sewer subsidy program \nof the Palau Public Utility Corporation (PPUC) for low- or fixed-income households \nhas been expanded to include those affected by COVID-19 economic impacts. \nThe lifeline subsidy covers 150 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 5,000 gallons \n(18,927 liters) each of water supply and wastewater services per household. The \naverage value of these subsidized services is about $40 per month for each \nparticipating household.18 Affected workers or families can apply for this benefit \ndirectly with the PPUC, which in turn will receive support from the MOF. The \nsubsidy is expected to cover an additional 1,500\u20132,000 households. As 34% of \nPalauan households are headed by women, about 510\u2013680 households headed \nby women stand to benefit from the expanded subsidy.    \n \n14.  Debt financing of fiscal deficits. The pause in economic activity because of COVID-19 \nrestrictions is resulting in large shortfalls in government revenue. Reduced business activity has \nconstrained tax collections, which are projected to decline by about 20% in FY2020 and another \n42% in FY2021. The government estimates that additional funding of about $21 million in FY2020 \nand $24 million in FY2021 will be required to bridge shortfalls and continue provision of critical \npublic services. With $20 million in financial support to businesses and workers authorized under \nthe CROSS Act, plus further funding of roughly the same amount needed to extend assistance \nmeasures until the end of FY2021 (footnote 13), fiscal accounts are projected to record deep \ndeficits equivalent to 12.2% of GDP in FY2020 and 23.8% in FY2021.19 It is anticipated that \ncorresponding levels of borrowing required to fill these financing gaps will result in a sharp rise in \npublic debt from the equivalent of 32.5% of GDP in FY2019 to 66.9% by FY2021 (Table 2). \n \n15.  Sound macroeconomic management. Palau has maintained annual fiscal surpluses \naveraging the equivalent of 3.0% of GDP since FY2011, even managing to continue solid fiscal \nmanagement amid the recent tourism downturn (para. 5). Further, the government saved the bulk \nof fiscal surpluses, resulting in growth in the general fund reserve to the equivalent of about 11.2% \nof GDP. On the revenue side, recent reforms to raise tobacco taxes and departure taxes has seen \nthe tax\u2013GDP ratio steadily rise to an average of 20.2% in FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.3% in the \n \n17  Palau is heavily reliant on long-term foreign workers, who comprise around 51.6% of paid employees.  \n18  A 2018 survey estimated average monthly electricity bills among urban households in Palau to be about $97.30. \nRefer to United Nations Development Programme Pacific. 2019. Palau 2018 Urban household electrical appliances, \nlights, and end-use survey (draft). \n19  These projected fiscal deficits are consistent with a scenario where Palau receives minimal numbers of tourists until \nthe end of FY2021, as discussed in para. 7. \n ", "7 \npreceding decade.20 Similarly, on the expenditure side, Palau has successfully controlled the \npublic sector wage bill, which has declined in proportion to GDP to an average of 14.7% during \nFY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.1% in the decade prior. ADB technical assistance (TA) supported the \ndevelopment of a human resource development plan for the civil service, as well as strengthening \nlinks between human resource and financial management information systems that contributed \nto this result.21 These achievements are even more notable considering the country\u2019s severe \nvulnerability to external shocks. Palau ranks first among 145 countries globally in the United \nNations\u2019  Economic  Vulnerability  Index,  a  measure  that  comprehensively  captures  various \nstructural constraints.22 Recent major external shocks include  typhoon Bopha in 2012 and \ntyphoon Haiyan in 2013. Palau\u2019s vulnerability highlights the crucial importance of maintaining \nadequate fiscal buffers, including in the general fund reserve, to enable immediate response to \ndisasters and other emergencies. In December 2018, ADB approved a contingent disaster \nfinancing instrument that supported government reform efforts to further strengthen resilience \nwhile also providing rapid access to critical fiscal post-disaster resources.23   \n \nTable 2: Selected Fiscal and Economic Indicators  \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise stated) \nItem  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018  FY2019e  FY2020p  FY2021p \nReal GDP growth (% change)  (0.4)  (2.0)  5.8   (1.8)  (9.5)  (12.8) \nInflation (% annual average)  (1.3)  0.9   2.0   0.6   0.4   0.8  \nCentral government budget             \n  Total revenue  42.0   40.0   44.4   43.5   39.7   42.2  \n    Tax revenue  19.9   19.8   21.2   20.0   17.7   11.6  \n    Nontax revenue  5.5   7.2   5.9   7.2   5.1   10.1  \n    Grants  16.6   13.0   17.3   16.3   16.9   20.4  \n  Total expenditure  38.4   35.2   38.2   43.1   51.9   66.0  \n    Recurrent  32.8   32.3   35.9   38.7   45.7   57.7  \n      % of which is wages and salaries  13.8   14.9   15.6   15.7   17.4   19.9  \n    Capital  5.7   2.9   2.3   4.4   6.2   8.3  \n  Fiscal balance  3.6   4.8   6.2   0.3   (12.2)  (23.8) \n    Excluding external grants  (13.0)  (8.2)  (11.1)  (15.9)  (29.1)  (44.3) \nPublic debt  31.0   32.4   33.5   32.5   46.4   66.9  \n   % of which is external debt  25.3   28.2   30.7   31.1   45.2   65.9  \nNominal GDP ($ million)  296.7   287.6   285.3   280.4   254.9   224.3  \n( ) = negative, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nSources: Asian Development Outlook database and Graduate School USA. 2020.

The program applies lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in providing \nsupport to Pacific countries during the 2008\u20132009 global financial and economic crisis through \neconomic  recovery  support  programs.24 These  demonstrated  the  critical  need  to  support \naggregate demand while also protecting the fiscal position through prioritized and well-targeted \npublic expenditure programs.

Rapid  economic  recovery,  in  turn,  will  drive  a  quick  return  to  fiscal \nsustainability.  The  economic  recovery  support  programs  showed  the  importance  of \ncomplementary  TA,  particularly  to  develop  social  protection  programs  targeting  the  most \nvulnerable. A rapid assessment of COVID-19 impacts on vulnerable groups, through regional TA \non strengthening social protection in the Pacific, helped inform the government\u2019s response that is \nsupported by the program.25 Previous TA in Palau also highlights a need to account for potential \npolitical economy shifts that can affect delivery of support.26 The CROSS Act allows for possible \nrefinements to assistance measures after a political transition (footnote 13).  \n \n17.  Development coordination. The program complements early and ongoing support from \ndevelopment partners for the COVID-19 response, including $3.9 million of off-budget assistance \nunder the US Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act for enhancing health care \ncapacities and purchasing personal protective equipment; in-kind assistance of disinfectants from \nprivate companies in Japan; and provision of medical supplies, including infrared thermometers \nand 1,000 testing kits, along with training for local health workers from Taipei,China. The WHO \nprovides support to Palau through a representative office in Fiji and a liaison office in the \nFederated States of Micronesia. The US is also providing unemployment compensation to \naffected Palauan citizens, who may apply for direct assistance through the Palau Workforce and \nInnovation Act office.27 The program is developed in close coordination with the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) to ensure that the program helps safeguard macroeconomic stability during \nthe  crisis.  In  developing  this  program,  ADB  has  also  consulted  with  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank as key development partners.  \n \nB.  Proposed Program, Impacts, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n18.  The program\u2019s impact will be that government services and employment, particularly in \nthe health sector, are maintained while the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 \npandemic on the private sector are mitigated. The program\u2019s outcome will be reduced adverse \nimpacts of COVID-19 restrictions on Palau\u2019s population and businesses. The program will support \nthe government\u2019s COVID-19 response through the following outputs: (i) strengthening the health \nsystem\u2019s COVID-19 response measures, (ii) social assistance compensating for economic losses \nborne by unemployed workers, and (iii) economic relief for affected businesses. The program is \naligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, the country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller Pacific \ndeveloping member countries.28 The program is also aligned with Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities of addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality, accelerating progress in \ngender equality, and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.29  \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s support for Palau\u2019s comprehensive COVID-19 response is \nchanneled through various complementary assistance modalities. In April, ADB disbursed $15 \nmillion under the Palau Disaster Resilience Program, shortly after the scope of contingent disaster \nfinancing instruments was expanded to cover health-related emergencies (footnote 1). ADB is \nalso funding the procurement of essential medical supplies, including COVID-19 test kits and \npersonal protective equipment, totaling $185,000 via UNICEF through regional TA administered \n \n25  ADB. 2020.

Further, ADB  TA  also  supported  the  government  in refining  its  macro-fiscal \nframework to estimate financing needs more comprehensively for FY2020 and FY2021.31 Results \nfrom these TA projects informed the design of the proposed program. Palau has requested access \nto $1 million in grants from ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to further support its \nimmediate COVID-19 response. To provide financial safeguard against any potential disasters \nduring  this  critical  crisis  period,  ADB  is  working  with  the  government  to replenish  Palau\u2019s \ncontingent disaster financing instrument (footnote 23). ADB support inclusive of the proposed \nprogram addresses the FY2020 financing gap of $31.2 million (Table 3) and helps support \nCROSS Act implementation until January 2021 (footnote 13). However, expected unmet financing \nneeds in FY2021 remain substantial ($39.6 million), not only to support continuing government \noperations and employment but also to extend CROSS Program assistance to the end of the \nfiscal year (para. 14). Palau has had initial discussions with the World Bank on possible budget \nsupport in FY2021, with ADB and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation as potential \ncofinancing partners (para. 17). ADB is also planning a proposed policy-based operation in \nFY2021 supporting reforms in the PPUC.32 \n \n20.  Regional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  proposed  program  supports  Palau\u2019s \nregional cooperation and integration by providing support to tourism businesses (para. 13.[i]), \nwhich should enable regional tourism to recover more quickly following the immediate crisis. \nIt also provides some support for the livelihoods of migrant workers (para. 13.[iii]). The support \nshould also be seen within the broader context of ongoing ADB operations which support the \ntransformation of Palau\u2019s tourism industry to move towards high-value sustainable tourism. These \ninclude (i) ongoing and planned investments in water supply and sanitation as well as renewable \nenergy to safeguard Palau\u2019s pristine environment, and (ii) TA to prepare a comprehensive urban \ndevelopment strategy for Babeldaob, Palau\u2019s largest yet sparsely populated island, as the next \nfrontier  of  sustainable  tourism  development,  as  well  as  to  develop  information  and \ncommunications technology applications that harness improved internet connectivity to enhance \nthe visitor experience. Palau may also consider fully integrating comprehensive \u201cbuild back better\u201d \napproaches to tourism-led recovery, including alignment with the Secretariat of the Pacific \nRegional Environment Programme\u2019s call to feature environmental sustainability considerations in \nmembers\u2019 COVID-19 recovery plans.33 In the near-term, a careful restart to international tourism \ncan be facilitated by the possible creation of \u201csafe travel bubbles\u201d with main tourist markets. Palau \nhas  had  preliminary  bilateral  discussions  on  the  requirements  for  establishing  such  an \narrangement with partner countries. The viability of any travel bubble will hinge on strong shared \nprotocols for testing, contact tracing, and medical care to prevent any COVID-19 outbreaks.  \n \nC.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support, and Debt Sustainability \n \n21.  The adverse economic and fiscal impacts of COVID-19 restrictions are projected to \nsignificantly raise the government\u2019s financing needs to $31.2 million (equivalent to 12.2% of GDP) \n \n30  ADB. 2020.

To bridge these large \ndevelopment financing needs and adequately resource its COVID-19 response program, the \ngovernment has requested a concessional loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources.34 The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest \nrate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nTable 3: Development Financing Needs, FY2020 and FY2021 \n  FY2020 Pre-COVID-19  FY2020 with COVID-19  FY2021 with COVID-19 \nItem  $ million  % of GDP  $ million  % of GDP  $ million  % of GDP \nRevenues  120.6   47.3   101.1   39.7   94.6   42.2 \nExpenditures  121.2   47.6   132.3   51.9   148.0   66.0 \nFiscal balance  (0.6)  (0.2)  (31.2)  (12.2)  (53.4)  (23.8) \nFinancing needs  0.6    31.2    53.4   \n Gov\u2019t. deposits  0.6    (3.8)    13.8   \n ADB CDF      15.0       \n ADB HEALS Program      20.0       \n To be determined          39.6   \n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, CDF = contingent disaster financing, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, \nFY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, Gov\u2019t = government, HEALS = Health Expenditure and Livelihoods \nSupport. \nNote: The ADB CDF and HEALS Program will continue to support the Coronavirus Relief One-Stop Shop Program \nassistance until January 2021.

The government has also indicatively allocated $10 million \nfrom savings to help finance the FY2021 deficit.  \nSources: ADB estimates. \n \n22.  Debt sustainability. Palau\u2019s public debt is mostly external, with domestic debt limited to \narrears and accounts payable equivalent to only 1.4% of GDP as of FY2019. External public debt \nfell gradually from the equivalent of 38.3% of GDP in FY2009 during the immediate aftermath of \nthe global financial and economic crisis to 23.1% in FY2015. A recent steady rise in external \npublic debt to the equivalent of 31.1% by FY2019 reflects infrastructure investments in the \ninformation and communications technology as well as in water supply and sanitation supported \nby ADB.35 Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, a February 2019 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) by the \nIMF concluded that Palau\u2019s public debt was sustainable. Although the heavy economic and fiscal \nimpacts of COVID-19 are expected to push Palau\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio to 46.4% in FY2020 \nand 66.9% in FY2021, ADB\u2019s own DSA shows that debt will maintain a steady downward trend in \nthe medium term as the economy recovers.36 With sustained recovery, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio \ncan revert to the pre-COVID-19 level by FY2028, even under conservative economic growth \nassumptions. Further, total projected borrowing during FY2020 and FY2021 is not seen to add \nsignificantly to annual debt service obligations facing the government. The ADB DSA concludes \nthat Palau\u2019s public debt remains sustainable and fiscal vulnerabilities are contained. These results \nbroadly align with the conclusions of the latest IMF DSA as noted in the assessment letter.37  \n \n34  The government\u2019s formal letter to ADB, received on 3 April 2020, requests total financing of $50 million to cover \nprojected needs in FY2020 and FY2021. This amount can include the proposed HEALS Program, replenishment of \nPalau\u2019s contingent disaster financing instrument, and possible follow-on policy-based operations to further support \nthe COVID-19 response. \n35  ADB. 2013.

Manila; and footnote 9. \n36  Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The IMF\u2019s slightly less \npessimistic view on debt dynamics stems from (i) an assumed earlier recovery that starts in 2020; (ii) lower resulting \nfiscal stimulus requirements, particularly in FY2021; and (iii) greater use of fiscal buffers (government deposits) to fill \nfinancing gaps.   \n ", "11 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The MOF will be the executing agency responsible for coordinating and monitoring \nprogram implementation. Implementing agencies include the MOH for support for health services, \nas well as the MCCA and the Division of Labor under the Ministry of Justice for CROSS Program \nassistance, along with the MOF. The CROSS Act requires the minister of finance to regularly \ninspect records for any inappropriate or duplicate assistance and produce monthly reports on \nexpenditure and the number of beneficiaries served. Regular collection of sex-disaggregated data \nof beneficiaries will be implemented for monitoring and reporting purposes to measure the \nachievement  of  gender monitoring  targets.38 Implementation  capacity will  be  supplemented \nthrough  ADB  regional  TA  supporting  social  protection  (footnote  25)  and  gender  equality \n(forthcoming).  The  program  implementation  period  is  from  April  2020  to  January  2021. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).39 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n24.  Governance. Palau has a strong recent record of sound fiscal management as exhibited \nby achievement of annual fiscal surpluses since FY2011 (para. 15), but the latest IMF assessment \npoints to broader public financial management aspects that need to be improved over the medium \nterm. These include strengthening the public investment management framework, improving \nfiscal management of state-owned enterprises, and upgrading financial management information \nsystems.40 ADB is supporting tariff, financial management, and corporate governance reforms in \nthe PPUC, one of Palau\u2019s largest state-owned enterprises (footnote 32). Although a public \nexpenditure and financial accountability self-assessment was conducted in 2013, results are not \npublicly  available  and  a  planned  follow-on  formal  assessment  has  been  delayed.  Timely \ncommencement of a formal assessment will be critical to identifying further actions for inclusion \nin a revised public financial management reform plan. Palau is among the better performing \nPacific countries in ADB\u2019s country performance assessment exercise, with above-average ratings \n(3.5 or better on a scale of 1.0 to 6.0 with 6.0 being the best) in key dimensions as of 2018.41 \nThese dimensions include debt policy and management, quality of budgetary and financial \nmanagement, and efficiency of revenue mobilization. Nonetheless, Palau still exhibits the same \nstructural constraints common to its regional peers that result in thin capacities for effective \ngovernance. This is reflected in a country performance assessment policy performance score of \n3.3,  just  above  the  threshold  for  fragility.  Thus,  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  regional  TA \nsupporting effective and sustainable delivery of development results in fragile situations in the \nPacific will also be used to help inform further interventions in Palau.42 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n25.  Poverty and inequality. Although Palau is classified as a high-income country according \nto the World Bank\u2019s latest classifications, elevated cost structures stemming from diseconomies \nof scale in production, limited competition, and remoteness tend to erode the purchasing power \nof households. In purchasing power parity terms, per capita gross national income in Palau as of \n2018 falls below that of some upper-middle income ADB developing member countries (e.g., \nKazakhstan and Malaysia). With per capita incomes at serious risk of falling back to pre-FY2012 \n \n38  Gender Monitoring Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39  List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40  IMF. 2019.

Manila.  \n ", "12 \nlevels in nominal terms (para. 8), and as far back as pre-FY2000 levels in real terms, purchasing \npower  of  Palauan  households  will  be  severely  restricted  during  the  projected  economic \ncontractions of FY2020 and FY2021. The 2014 Household Income and Expenditure Survey \nindicated that 19.4% of Palau\u2019s population falls below the basic needs poverty line, down from \n24.9% in 2006.43 However, the proportion of the population who had incomes just above the basic \nneeds poverty line increased from 5.1% to 10.1%, indicating that more Palauans are economically \nvulnerable and at risk of falling into hardship amid adverse shocks. Inequality, as measured by a \nGini coefficient of 0.36, remained relatively low and in line with the average for Asia and the Pacific \n(footnote 43). However, a projected cumulative reduction in real per capita incomes of 22.6% \nbecause of the COVID-19 crisis has the potential to increase the poverty rate to 27.9% by the end \nof FY2021.44 Social impacts of the projected economic contractions will be most severe for \nhouseholds deriving income from tourism-related activities and therefore directly affected by \nresulting business closures and job losses. Assistance and relief measures supported by the \nHEALS Program will help mitigate adverse impacts on both employers and employees.   \n \n26.  Gender. The program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Measures to \ncontain the health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis will exacerbate existing gender inequalities and \nrisk progress that has been made in supporting the economic empowerment of women. Women \nin Palau are underrepresented in formal employment, with only 41% of women in paid work \n(compared to 60% of men), and they are significantly less likely to own or run businesses because \nof a number of factors including household, community, and caring responsibilities and a severe \nlack of time. As such, the economic downturn will increase the gender wage gap and put additional \npressure on the already limited number of small and medium-sized enterprises owned by women. \nHouseholds headed by women are more likely to face poverty and have on average 18% less in \naverage monthly income than households headed by men, and they may be at increased risk of \npoverty and food insecurity during the COVID-19 crisis. In terms of health outcomes, all women \nin Palau have access to reproductive health services but noncommunicable diseases are a \nleading cause of death in Palau (including for women) and it will be important to ensure essential \nservices continue during other health emergencies such as COVID-19. In addition, one-quarter \nof women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner in their lifetime and the \nprevalence and severity of gender-based violence is likely to increase. Finally, 77% of the frontline \nhealth workers are women, and they are at increased risk of infection from COVID-19. \n \n27.  The program ensures that all female employers and employees in Palau will have access \nto support including (i) unemployment benefit for all women at risk of losing their jobs, (ii) \ntemporary  employment  schemes  (including  in  areas  such  as  tourism  enhancement, \nenvironmental protection, and care for vulnerable populations), (iii) ensuring all public servants \n(of which 53% are women) continue to be employed, and (iv) concessional or interest-free \nbusiness loans that target and prioritize businesses owned by women. Unemployment measures \nwill be open to informal workers (e.g., roadside vendors) and migrant workers, who are particularly \nvulnerable and may not have the savings, networks, or other safety nets to support them during \nthe downturn in business. In addition, the PPUC will expand the lifeline utility subsidy and ensure \nthat households headed by women are prioritized and among the first to benefit. Health measures \ninclude (i) continuation of free health care including maternal and reproductive health, (ii) priority \nCOVID-19 testing for frontline health workers, (iii) overtime and hazard pay for frontline health \nworkers, and (iv) a telephone hotline for gender-based violence information and referrals.

The projected 22.6% fall in real per capita incomes can therefore \ntranslate to a 49.6% increase in the basic needs poverty rate. \n ", "13 \naddition, the government has committed to ringfencing funds for gender-based violence services \nin the FY2021 budget (October 2020). Finally, women\u2019s unpaid care burden will be supported by \nprovision of free preschool and child day care facilities for lower-income families. \n \n28.  Safeguards. No adverse environmental, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples \nimpacts under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) have been identified. Thus, the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary settlement, and indigenous peoples. \n  \n29.  Risk and mitigating measures.

Adverse impact of  Palau\u2019s economy is projected to contract by 9.5% in FY2020 and \nexogenous shock  12.8% in FY2021 because of global travel restrictions amid the COVID-\n19 pandemic. The depth of projected economic contractions is nearly \ndouble that seen during the global financial and economic crisis of \n2008\u20132009 and can push per capita nominal incomes back to below \nthe FY2012 level in nominal terms, or as far back as pre-FY2000 levels \nin real terms. The economic downturn is expected to result in the loss \nof more than 3,100 jobs, or about 27% of the total workforce, resulting \nin the lowest level of employment in Palau\u2019s history. Around 39% of job \nlosses will involve women. Social impacts of the projected economic \ncontractions will be most severe for households deriving income from \ntourism-related activities and therefore directly affected by resulting \nbusiness closures and job losses. Given these heavy economic and \nsocial impacts, the basic needs poverty rate may increase to up to \n29.0% of households by the end of FY2021 from 19.4% in 2014.  \n2. Countercyclical  A first supplementary budget was passed in March 2020, allocating \ndevelopment  $0.9 million for emergency supplies, additional screening, and testing, \nexpenditure  plus  $6.0  million  from  general  fund  reserves  to  bridge  revenue \nshortfalls and maintain government operations. Palau then approved a \nsecond  supplementary  budget  in  April,  including  a  $20  million \ncountercyclical development expenditure program in the form of the \nCoronavirus Relief One-Stop Shop Program which will provide (i) loans \nto businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) unemployment \nbenefit  for  workers  whose  employment  has  been  terminated, \nsuspended,  or  reduced  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic;  (iii) \ntemporary funding for temporary employment schemes by the public \nsector  and  nongovernment  organizations;  and  (iv)  lifeline  utility \nsubsidies for low- or fixed-income households to include those affected \nby the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional funding is also made available \nfor the Palau Red Cross, education aid to nonpublic schools, and \nconsular  assistance  for  citizens  stranded  abroad.  The  second \nsupplementary  budget  further  authorizes  a  total  of  $60  million  in \nadditional borrowing to finance continuing government operations and \nemployment, particularly to ringfence funding for essential services \nincluding  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s  ongoing  capacity  strengthening \nmeasures and the Ministry of Community and Cultural Affairs\u2019 social \nassistance programs. \n3. Preshock record of  Palau  recorded  annual  fiscal  surpluses  (averaging  3.1%  of  GDP) \ngenerally sound  during FY2011\u2013FY2019, even amid a tourism downturn since FY2016. \nmacroeconomic  During the tourism boom years, the government saved the bulk of fiscal \nmanagement  surpluses, resulting in an increase in the general fund reserve to the \nequivalent of about 11.2% of GDP. This fiscal buffer has reduced the \nneed for external financing to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. External \npublic debt fell gradually from the equivalent of 38.3% of GDP in \nFY2009 during the immediate aftermath of the global financial and \neconomic crisis to 23.1% in FY2015. A recent steady rise in external \npublic debt to the equivalent of 30.9% by FY2019 mainly reflects \n ", "  Appendix 4  23 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \ninfrastructure  investments  in  information  and  communications \ntechnology as well as water supply and sanitation supported by ADB. \nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, public debt was the equivalent of \nabout 32.5% of GDP in FY2019 and was rated sustainable by the IMF. \n4. Structural reforms  Palau  has  instituted  COVID-19  response  measures  including  (i) \nactivating the Ministry of Health\u2019s Emergency Operations Center to \nspearhead  COVID-19  preparedness  and  response  measures;  (ii) \nhealth screening for all international arrivals since late January and full \nborder  closure  from  26  March  2020;  (iii)  issuing  a  certification  of \nunavoidable  public  health  emergency;  and  (iv)  COVID-19  testing \ntargeting  frontline  health  workers  and  at-risk  groups  to  effectively \nminimize  the  risk  of  an  outbreak  in  Palau.  Resources  are  being \nmobilized  to  strengthen  monitoring  capacities,  primarily  through \ncontinuing  health  screenings,  rolling-out  COVID-19  testing,  and \ninstalling  additional  ventilators  at  Belau  National  Hospital.  Other \nsystem  strengthening  measures  include  preparing  alternative  care \nsites to provide critical health services should any suspected cases be \ndetected, paying overtime and hazard rates to frontline health workers, \nand activating a 24-hour COVID-19 hotline for public inquiries. On \nbroader public sector management reforms, Palau\u2019s tax\u2013GDP ratio \nsteadily rose to 20.2% in FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.3% during the \npreceding decade, mainly because of increased tobacco and departure \ntaxes  to  safeguard  public  health  and  the  environment.  On  the \nexpenditure side, Palau has successfully controlled the public sector \nwage  bill,  which  declined  in  proportion  to  GDP  to  14.7%  during \nFY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.1% in the decade prior. \n5. Debt sustainability  CPRO borrowing through the HEALS Program will add the equivalent \nof about 7.8% of GDP to public debt. The size of the total financing \nenvelope necessary to counter the heavy economic and fiscal impacts \nof COVID-19 are expected to push Palau\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio to \n46.4% in FY2020 and 66.9% in FY2021. However, ADB\u2019s own DSA \nshows that, thereafter, debt will maintain a steady downward trend in \nthe medium term as the economy recovers. With sustained recovery, \nthe public debt\u2013GDP ratio can revert to the pre-COVID-19 level over \nthe  medium  term,  even  under  conservative  economic  growth \nassumptions. Further, the HEALS Program loan is not seen to add \nsignificantly to annual debt service obligations facing the government. \nThe ADB DSA therefore concludes that Palau\u2019s public debt remains \nsustainable and fiscal vulnerabilities are contained.   \n6. IMF coordination  ADB is closely coordinating with the IMF on the financing envelope for \nPalau.  The  IMF\u2019s  assessment  letter  confirms  ADB\u2019s  views  on  (i) \nPalau\u2019s  preshock  record  of  generally  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement, as reflected primarily by the achievement of annual fiscal \nsurpluses over a sustained period; and (ii) debt sustainability being \nmaintained over the medium to long term with projected economic \nrecovery driving a swift return of the debt\u2013GDP ratio to pre-COVID-19 \nlevels shortly after the crisis period. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 pandemic response option, \nDSA = debt sustainability analysis, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, HEALS = Health Expenditure and \nLivelihoods Support, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "ADB", "CreationDate": "D:20200730105320+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "54245-001, palau, health, public sector, covid-19, coronavirus, pandemic, social protection, adb projects, adb projects, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20200804073421+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "Subject": "The Health Expenditure and Livelihoods Support (HEALS) Program under the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO) will support the government\u2019s response to the potentially devastating health and economic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including though increased health sector spending and sustained funding for social protection programs.
