INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  for  preparing  the  Regional  Logistics \nDevelopment Project. ADB considered this request, and a fact-finding mission visited the project \narea in June 2008. The mission carried out an initial poverty and social assessment and a rapid \nenvironmental  assessment,  and  discussed  technical  and  socioeconomic  issues  with \nrepresentatives of the Government, the Ministry of Road, Transport, and Tourism (MRTT), and \nthe Railway Authority of Mongolia. This paper is based on the Government\u2019s concurrence with \nthe  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  activities,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the PPTA.1 The PPTA is included in ADB\u2019s country \nassistance program for 2008.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia is a historical land bridge between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to the \nsouth and the Russian Federation to the north. The transport sector, which consists mainly of \nroads and railways, is a key driver of economic development in Mongolia. The road network, \nincluding both state and local roads, totals approximately 49,250 kilometers (km), connecting 21 \nmajor cities and towns and 160 smaller villages. The Mongolian railway system is 1,810 km long \nand carries over 90% of the country's freight. The main line connects the PRC rail system in the \nsouth with the Russian Trans-Siberian line in the north. The north\u2013south railway transport link, \ndeveloped in 1949, is the lifeline of the economy and most of the economic development in the \ncountry during the last 60 years has taken place along this corridor. The strategic location of \nMongolia  as  a  transit  country  between  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  has  helped \nincrease the transport demand, as has high economic growth in the country in recent years. \nEven though the transport capacity has risen in recent years, the transport sector in Mongolia is \nunable to meet this increasing demand, and this is seriously impacting economic growth.  \n \n3.  Since 2002, Mongolia\u2019s economy has been growing at a healthy rate, reaching 9.9% in \n2007. A large part of this has been due to growth in the mining sector. The discovery of huge \nmineral and coal reserves in Mongolia, particularly in the South Gobi, are expected to stimulate \nthe mining industry in the coming years, and this will contribute to high gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth (some estimates suggest GDP will increase by 4.7 times between 2007 and 2030). \nThe mining industry and the development of the secondary and tertiary sector are dependent on \nefficient transportation and logistics. Most of the mining products are expected to be exported to \nthe PRC or to international markets through Tianjin port in the PRC. These shipments will have to \ngo through Zamyn Uud, the only gateway to the south.  \n \n4.  Mongolia is also a landlocked country and as such faces greater transportation challenges \nthan countries with their own seaports. Mongolia relies on its two large neighbors, the Russian \nFederation and the PRC, for access to seaports. In recent years, trade flows have been reoriented \nfrom the Russian Federation and most imports (over 80%) now come from the PRC, through the \nZamyn Uud border point in the southeast of Mongolia. The bulk of Mongolia\u2019s exports also travel \nthrough Zamyn Uud en route to Tianjin port, the only port in the PRC available to Mongolia for \ninternational trade. As a consequence, the traffic handled at Zamyn Uud has expanded rapidly in \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 July 2008. \n2  This PPTA is included in the 2008 TA program as a replacement for the South Gobi Infrastructure Development \nProject ($800,000) now split into two projects: ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Preparing the \nRegional Logistics Development Project. Manila; and ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Preparing \nthe South Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project. Manila. \n ", "2   \nrecent years, to the point where Zamyn Uud is now badly congested,3 which affects imports, \nexports, and transit traffic. Although delays have several causes (such as nonavailability of rolling \nstock, change of rail gauge, and delays at customs), the main one is the grossly inadequate \nlogistics capability in Mongolia in general and at Zamyn Uud in particular.  \n \n5.  Efficient  and  well-developed  logistics  are  identified  as  the  key  to  cost-effective  and \ncompetitive transportation. Trade logistics, or the capacity to connect to international markets to \nship goods, is critical for developing countries if they are to improve their competitiveness, reap \nthe benefits of globalization, and fight poverty more effectively in an increasingly integrated \nworld. A World Bank-funded study,4 based on a world survey of international freight forwarders \nand express carriers, indicates that facilitating the capacity to connect firms, suppliers, and \nconsumers are crucial in a world where predictability and reliability are becoming even more \nimportant than costs. A country's ability to connect to global markets is fast becoming a key \naspect of its capacity to compete, grow, attract investment, create jobs, and reduce poverty. For \nthose countries unable to connect, the costs of exclusion are large and growing. Unfortunately, \nMongolia\u2019s performance in all indicators of logistics management is at the bottom end. Based on \na  worldwide  survey  completed  by  more  than  800  logistics  professionals,  the  World  Bank \ndeveloped  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  logistics  performance  in  150  countries  and \ndeveloped a logistics performance index.5 Mongolia has an overall logistics performance index \nranking of 129\u2013150 (1 is the best and 150 is the worst);6 its ranking for customs procedures is \n131, for logistics costs (including freight rates) 144, infrastructure quality 129, ability to track and \ntrace shipments 136, and timeliness in reaching a destination 142. Mongolia\u2019s ranking clearly \nindicates  serious  issues  in  logistics  development;  this  situation  is  hurting  the  country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness and has serious repercussions for its economic performance. \n \n6.  Zamyn Uud, a town with a population of about 10,000 on the Mongolian\u2013PRC border, is \nthe historic intermodal interchange point for transport coming from the PRC to Mongolia, the \nRussian Federation, and Europe, and vice versa. It handles road to rail, rail to rail, and road to \nroad traffic. For import traffic into Mongolia and the transit traffic to the Russian Federation, the \nbulk of the traffic coming from the PRC or Tianjin by rail is transshipped to rail. In recent years, the \nvolume of traffic coming by road from the PRC is increasing and it is transshipped to rail at Zamyn \nUud. A very small proportion of the traffic coming by road is directly transported by road, as no \npaved road currently exists between Zamyn Uud and Ulaanbaatar or to the Russian Federation \nborder in the north.7 Most of the goods coming into Mongolia are destined for Ulaanbaatar, with \nconstruction material and foodstuffs accounting for the bulk of the cargo. Due to the limited \nlogistics facilities available at Zamyn Uud, it can sometimes take 50\u201360 days to get shipments into \nUlaanbaatar, which adversely affects the Mongolian people. In addition, the development of the \nmining sector is resulting in a huge demand for transporting coal and minerals.   \n \n7.  To handle the traffic at Zamyn Uud, two facilities were created, one of which was financed \nby the Japan Bank for International Cooperation in 1995. A temporary facility was also opened on \n                                                 \n3  Discussions with different stakeholders revealed that import cargoes could take anywhere between 10 and 60 days \nfor clearance at Zamyn Uud.  \n4  World Bank. 2007. Connecting to Compete: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy. Washington, DC. \n5  The logistics performance index aggregates performance in seven areas, from traditional ones\u2014such as customs \nprocedures, logistics costs (including freight rates), and infrastructure quality\u2014to new areas like the ability to track \nand trace shipments, timeliness in reaching a destination, and the competence of the domestic logistics industry. \nThe survey had the support and participation of the International Association of Freight Forwarders, the Global \nExpress Association, the Global Facilitation Partnership, and the Turku School of Economics. \n6  The only other countries in Asia with rankings lower than Mongolia are Tajikistan and Afghanistan. \n7  A two-lane road from Choyr to Zamyn Uud, partially financed by ADB, is under construction and is expected to be \ncompleted by the end of 2009. \n ", "  3\n11 June 2008. The three facilities are all basic\u2014they have no warehousing facilities, limited and \noutdated materials handling equipment, no planned layout, no transshipment facilities from road to \nrail, and no heavy-duty cranes, and they lack the operational concept of a logistics terminal. \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) is also supporting the concept of \nestablishing a logistics center at Zamyn Uud and is funding a study on possible public-private \npartnership project. ADB will liaise with USAID in finalizing the proposed feasibility study. \n \n8.  The Government supports the development of intermodal transport and seeks to build a \nstrong logistics network in the country in order to enhance its global competitiveness. Because \nof its location, Mongolia is the focal point for international north\u2013south transit trade, and the \nGovernment is signatory to a number of bilateral and multilateral agreements with neighboring \ncountries  and  international  organizations  for  facilitating  international  transport  through  the \ncountry. However, given the lack of logistics development in Mongolia and the situation at Zamyn \nUud, the Government requested ADB to provide PPTA support for (i) developing a strategy for \nmultimodal transport development in Mongolia, and (ii) developing logistics facilities at Zamyn \nUud.  \n \n9.  ADB  has  led  international  donor  efforts  in  the  Mongolian  transport  sector  with  a \ncombination of policy and project interventions. The country strategy and program for Mongolia \nand the regional cooperation strategy and program update for Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation8 identify transport as strategically important for ADB assistance. Since 1993, ADB \nhas approved three loans and one grant for road sector development and two loans for aviation \nsector development, with an overall value of $184.7 million. In addition, ADB provided 12 TA \nprojects totaling $6.37 million for the transport sector. The portfolio performance in Mongolia\u2019s \nroad sector has been satisfactory. The first three loans assisted rehabilitation and upgrading of \nMongolia\u2019s first north\u2013south corridor.9 The corridor is part of the United Nations Economics and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)-designated Asian Highway Network \n(Asian Highway 3). ADB is supporting the development of the first phase (431 km, from Yarant \nto Hovd) of a second north\u2013south corridor in Mongolia, which runs for about 750 km from the \nborder  with  the  PRC  at  Yarant,  through  Hovd  and  Olgiy,  to  the  border  with  the  Russian \nFederation  at  Tsagaannuur,  and  is  part  of  Asian  Highway  4.  ADB  has  not  provided  any \nassistance to the development of the railway sector in Mongolia. In trade facilitation, ADB has \nprovided six TA projects (including five regional TA projects), and one loan for a customs \nmodernization project. \n \n10.  The ADB strategy for Mongolia identifies the underdeveloped transport network and \ninefficient cross-border transport as major transport sector issues. The regional cooperation \nstrategy  and  program  update  for  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  identifies \nmultimodal transport as a strategically important priority, and developing multimodal facilities at \nZamyn Uud as a key intervention for possible ADB assistance. The ongoing sector assistance \nprogram evaluation also identifies the need for improving logistics as a key area for future \nsupport. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006.

The second project for developing the Nalayh\u2013Choyr section was successfully completed in 2005 and \nwas also rated \"highly successful\". Implementation of the third road project is ongoing. The ongoing sector \nevaluation identifies overall assessment of ADB involvement in the transport sector as successful. ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  of  the  PPTA  will  be  to  promote  an  efficient,  competitive,  reliable,  and \nenvironmentally friendly multimodal transport network in Mongolia, under the overall framework \nof promoting environmentally sustainable development and inclusive growth in Mongolia. The \noutcome  of  the  PPTA  will  be  a  strategy,  agreed  to  with  the  Government,  for  developing \nmultimodal  transport  and  a  project  design  for  developing  a  multimodal  transport  facility  at \nZamyn Uud suitable for ADB-financing. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The PPTA will have two components: component 1 produces a national strategy for \npromoting multimodal transport in Mongolia, and component 2 determines the scope of the \nproject  loan  for  developing  a  multimodal  facility  at  Zamyn  Uud,  including  the  specific \ncomponents to be financed by ADB and the Government.  \n \n13.  For component 1, the consultants will review the current status of the transport sector at \nthe national and regional level and develop short-term (2009\u20132015) and long-term (2016\u20132020) \nstrategies for multimodal transport sector development in Mongolia. The PPTA will look at the \ncomplementarities of the different modes of transport and recommend measures to enhance \nmultimodal  transport  development,  logistics  development  and  management,  and  freight \nforwarding activity in the country. Based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats \nanalysis for each mode, lessons learned, and the international experience in similar economies, \nthe PPTA will prepare an investment plan and recommend the policy, institutional, reform, legal, \nand  other  facilitating  measures  to  be  adopted  by  the  Government  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for developing multimodal transport in the country. A road map for promoting \nmultimodal transport will be prepared at the end of the PPTA. A participatory approach will be \ntaken while implementing the PPTA, and extensive consultation with stakeholders will also be \nundertaken. Two workshops and a seminar will be held to discuss and disseminate the findings \nof the PPTA. A final report will be published at the end of the PPTA. \n \n14.  For component 2, the PPTA will cover all relevant areas including technical, financial, \neconomic viability, and institutional and organizational aspects of the project design. The PPTA \nwill focus on (i) technical design of the multimodal facility at Zamyn Uud; (ii) financing and \ninstitutional arrangements for managing and operating the facility; (iii) economic and financial \nassessments; (iv) environment, resettlement, poverty, and social assessments; (v) stakeholder \nconsultation; (vi) assessment of regional benefits; and (vii) examining and identifying key trade \nfacilitation measures to enhance the competitiveness of external and internal trade. The key \nactivities are field surveys, document review, data analysis, and consultation with stakeholders, \nincluding government officials, project beneficiaries, affected persons (including women and the \npoor), and other development partners. \n \n15.  The PPTA will (i) examine possible opportunities for private sector participation including \nthe possibility of public\u2013private partnerships, (ii) provide support for enterprise reforms and \nrestructuring of transport enterprises, (iii) assess opportunities for promoting good governance \nin operation and procedures for enhancing efficiency and achieving financial self-sufficiency in a \nmarket  environment,  and  (iv)  examine  the  capacity-development  initiatives  that  can  be \nsupported for developing a vibrant and sustainable logistics industry in Mongolia.  \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated to be $500,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent. The PPTA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the cost, equivalent to \n$100,000, through the provision of office accommodation and the counterpart staff required to \nimplement the PPTA. The Government has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Executing Agency for the PPTA will be the MRTT. A steering committee comprising \nrepresentatives  of  the  concerned  departments  and  agencies  will  be  set  up  to  oversee \nimplementation, provide guidance and direction, and facilitate coordination and cooperation \namong the subsectors and stakeholders. The committee will include representatives of agencies \nresponsible for planning and development of roads, railways, civil aviation, and river and urban \ntransport.  Representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Industry  and  Trade,  customs,  legal \ndepartment, freight forwarders, and other agencies will also attend the steering committee to \nensure that all relevant information is readily available to the consultants. In addition, MRTT will \nappoint a project coordinator who will be responsible for coordinating and supervising the work \nof consultants on a day-to-day basis and serve as a liaison point between the consultants and \nother agencies.  \n \n18.  The  PPTA  will  require  about  22  person-months  of  consulting  services  (11  person-\nmonths  for  international  consultants,  and  11  person-months  for  national  consultants).  The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A consulting firm will be selected and \nengaged following the quality- and cost-based selection method (quality-cost ratio of 80:20), and \nbiodata technical proposals will be required. The international and national consultants will work \ntogether and have expertise in (i) multimodal transport planning (economic analysis, financial \nanalysis,  and  policy  and  institutional  development);  (ii)  civil  engineering  as  applied  to \ndevelopment  of  multimodal  facilities;  (iii)  handling  equipment  for  multimodal  facilities;  (iv) \npoverty, social analysis, and resettlement; and (v) environmental issues. The consultants will \nprocure equipment in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, and this equipment will \nbe handed over to MRTT on completion of the PPTA. The PPTA will take into consideration all \nprevious  studies  done  by  the  Government,  ADB,  other  multilateral  agencies,  and  bilateral \nagencies. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for consulting services.  \n \n19.  The PPTA is expected to begin in October 2008 and be completed by June 2009. MRTT \nagreed to provide the assistance required for implementing the PPTA. MRTT will also make \navailable (i) all relevant reports, studies, and information; (ii) suitable office accommodation and \nappropriate and qualified counterpart staff; and (iii) any other assistance that the consultants \nmay reasonably request, including liaison with the Government and local authorities. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for preparing the Regional Logistics Development Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.
