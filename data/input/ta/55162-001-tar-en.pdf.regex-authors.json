INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat and its Member States1 to implement the ASEAN \nAgreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) Work Programme \n2021\u201320252 by  supporting  increased  cooperation  and  enhancing  capacity  on  disaster  risk \nmanagement  (DRM). 3  The  TA  will  contribute  by  (i)  increasing  regional  cooperation  on \ntransboundary  risks,  (ii)  introducing  high-level  technology  for  regional  cooperation  on \ntransboundary risks, and (iii) advancing interregional cooperation through capacity building and \nknowledge exchange.  \n \n2.  The TA is not included in the 2021 ADB Management-approved results-based work plan \nof the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC).4 The TA is consistent \nwith the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities 1 (addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities); 3 (tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability);  and  7  (fostering  regional \ncooperation  and  integration).  It  will  also  strengthen  linkages  with  operational  priority  2  on \naccelerating progress in gender equality.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Southeast Asia has some of the world\u2019s most extensive transboundary disaster risks, \nincluding  droughts  and  floods  in  the  Mekong  Basin;  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  and  volcanic \neruptions across the Ring of Fire; and tropical cyclones and storms along coastlines and islands. \nWith the increasing levels of disaster risk\u2014in part driven by the concentration of people and \nassets in hazard-exposed areas, environmental degradation, and climate change\u2014the region \nneeds to strengthen its cooperation and capacity to enhance regional public goods and reduce \nthe social and economic impacts from transboundary disasters and emergencies. \n \n4.  Since 2009, ASEAN has led the region\u2019s DRM efforts through the AADMER, a legally \nbinding agreement on regional cooperation in disaster management and emergency response.6 \nSince coming into force, it has provided a framework for ASEAN in advancing efforts to realize its \nvision of building \u201ca region of disaster-resilient nations, mutually assisting and complementing one \nanother, sharing a common bond in minimizing adverse effects of disasters in pursuit of safer \ncommunities and sustainable development\u201d (footnote 2). The AADMER is operationalized through \n5-year work programs, developed by the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management. The work \nprogram provides a platform for coordination among development partners to ensure synergies \nand avoid overlap. \n \n5.  The first AADMER work program (2010\u20132015) put in place regional mechanisms for joint \nresponse and disaster risk reduction, including establishing wide-ranging partnerships. The \nsecond work program (2016\u20132020) focused on protecting development gains through priority \n \n1  Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia,  Myanmar,  the \nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  ASEAN.  2020.

Jakarta. \n3  The TA is in response to a request from the ASEAN Secretariat. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 August 2021. \n5  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila.   \n6  ASEAN. 2005. ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response. Jakarta. \n \n  ", "2 \nprograms covering risk assessment, disaster prevention and mitigation, disaster preparedness \nand emergency response, disaster recovery, and knowledge and innovation. The third and current \nwork program (2021\u20132025) seeks to enhance and support ASEAN\u2019s disaster risk reduction and \ndisaster  management  capabilities  through  five  priority  programs\u2014risk  assessment  and \nmonitoring, prevention and mitigation, preparedness and response, resilient recovery, and global \nleadership\u2014each overseen by one of the three ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management \nworking groups and co-chaired by the ASEAN Member States. \n \n6.  Recognizing the AADMER\u2019s increasing maturity over successive work programs, the \nscope and ambition of the current work program have expanded to cover slow-onset hazards \nsuch as drought, and play a more active role in transboundary issues at both the operational and \nnormative levels. Further, the work program seeks to engage with regional DRM organizations \noutside ASEAN to exchange knowledge and build mutually beneficial working relationships.7 \n \n7.  While the AADMER was developed before the adoption of the Sendai Framework for \nDisaster Risk Reduction8 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),9 the subsequent work \nprograms responded to the commitments made by ASEAN Member States on resilient and \nsustainable development, particularly SDGs 1, 5, 11, and 13.10 The current work program has \nclear synergies with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, as both seek to scale up support to address disaster \nrisks, climate change, and environmental degradation; take a comprehensive approach to building \nclimate and disaster resilience; and increase support for regional public goods and collective \nactions to mitigate cross-border risks. \n \n8.  In 2017, the Integrated Disaster Risk Management (IDRM) Fund\u2014an ADB-administered \ntrust fund established in 2013 with financing support from the Government of Canada, which \naimed to help develop innovative regional solutions to DRM in Southeast Asia developing member \ncountries (DMCs)\u2014provided assistance to the second work program (2016\u20132020).11 The IDRM \nFund supported five of the eight priority areas of the second work program, including initiatives \nsuch as the Build Safely program and the ASEAN Recovery Forum, as well as the development \nof ASEAN guidelines on risk and vulnerability assessment, social protection in disaster recovery, \nand urban resilience. The IDRM Fund also provided capacity building to the ASEAN Secretariat. \nDespite high aspirations, the ASEAN Secretariat and member DMCs still have organizational and \ncapacity constraints. The implementation of activities in DMCs and the capacity of the ASEAN \nSecretariat both require investment to deliver the work program in support of the regional public \ngood of advancing regional cooperation in DRM.12 The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has \nhighlighted further opportunities to leverage digital solutions for enhancing cooperation. Closing \nthe regional digital divide will require greater investment in digital readiness, including putting in \nplace  data  and  knowledge  sharing  protocols,  storing  mechanisms,  and  user-friendly  and \naccessible applications, among others.13 The sustainability of this TA is premised on supporting \nagreed approaches within ASEAN by fostering an enabling environment for further investment in \nDMCs.  \n \n \n7  Peer regional bodies include the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the Pacific Community, and the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme. \n8  United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. 2015.

The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  ASEAN  Member  States\u2019  resilience  to \ntransboundary risks improved.14 The TA will have the following outcome: ASEAN\u2019s transboundary \nDRM capabilities enhanced.15 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Regional cooperation on understanding transboundary risks increased. \nBased on a comprehensive analysis, and in recognition of the transboundary nature of disaster \nrisk and the benefits of regional cooperation in reducing and managing disaster risk, the TA will \nsupport gender and socially inclusive as well as context-sensitive disaster scenario planning, risk \nassessments, and risk profiling using an ASEAN-agreed approach. This output is expected to \nincrease actionable knowledge and greater understanding between DMCs on the transboundary \nimplications of disasters and enhance evidence-based decision-making. This will include regional \nor multicountry scenario planning and risk assessments on key transboundary hazards, such as \nflood,  drought,  tsunami,  tropical  cyclone,  and  heat  wave  events,  as  well  as  increasing \nunderstanding on different climate change scenarios on hazards using, preferably, an open-\nsource geographic information system. The results of the output are expected to feed into relevant \nASEAN processes and programs, and inform investment projects within DMCs.  \n \n11.  To support greater engagement of women as leaders in community-based DRM as well \nas  action  on  disaster-responsive  social  protection,16 the  TA  will  enhance  the  capacity  of \ngrassroots women-led organizations across ASEAN. Drawing on good practice from the IDRM \nFund (footnote 12, where grassroots women\u2019s organizations proved effective in spearheading \ncommunity-based DRM, the support will facilitate leadership development, strengthen knowledge, \nand  harness  peer-to-peer  learning  and  networking  across  the  region,  including  in  tackling \ntransboundary hazards.  \n \n12.  To advance the implementation of the ASEAN Declaration on the Strengthening of \nAdaptation to Drought,17 selected DMCs will be supported to implement gender and socially \ninclusive action to prepare for and reduce drought risk. \n \n13.  Output 2: High-level technology for regional cooperation on transboundary risks \nintroduced. The AADMER Work Programme 2021\u20132025 builds on the ASEAN Information and \nCommunication Technology (ICT) Roadmap on Disaster Management, which provides several \nentry points for the integration of high-level technology and innovative solutions to improve ICT \nefficiency, productivity, quality, functionality, and access.18 A key priority of the AADMER Work \nProgramme is the development of an online platform (or an innovation hub) that will serve as the \nASEAN-wide repository of knowledge products and tools on risk assessment, disaster risk \nreduction, preparedness, response, recovery, and training programs; support data visualizations \nand geographic information system applications; capture innovative DRM solutions and learning \namong ASEAN Member States; and provide a platform for a virtual network and community of \npeers. The TA will support a user-centered design process and understanding of the ecosystem, \n \n14  Adapted from ASEAN. 2005. ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response.

The TA will support the development of guidelines for the online platform, including \nstandards,  protocols,  regulations,  and  safeguards  on  the  use  of  digital  technology  for \ntransboundary  risks.  Priority  digital  solutions  that  will  be  explored  include  monitoring  and \npredictive analysis for slow-onset hazards, social media monitoring and analysis for early warning, \nartificial intelligence for cloud computing, and data mining on post-disaster recovery. The TA will \nsupport the development of a data governance strategy that addresses interoperability, privacy, \nand security. The TA will support the application of selected digital solutions for disaster risk \nreduction and post-disaster recovery in two ASEAN DMCs.  \n \n15.  Output  3:  Interregional  cooperation  through  capacity  building  and  knowledge \nexchange  advanced.  Leveraging  ASEAN\u2019s  leadership  in  DRM,  the  TA  will  support  the \nestablishment of a dialogue mechanism between ASEAN and selected peer regional bodies to \nenhance collaboration and knowledge exchange on DRM. Positioned at the technical level, a \ngovernance structure and work plan will be developed to guide efforts to increase collaboration \nand knowledge exchange and to identify opportunities for capacity building. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.3 million, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund,19 (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the High-Level Technology Fund,20 and (iii) $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Canada, all to be administered by ADB. \n \n17.  Ineligible items under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund include civil works, \nthe procurement of large-scale equipment (such as machinery and other capital equipment), and \nsalaries for permanent staff of the TA\u2019s executing and/or implementing agencies. Expenditures \nrelated to technologies that are undergoing early-stage research and development are ineligible \nunder the High-Level Technology Fund. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA. The Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Division \nof  ADB\u2019s  SDCC  will  implement  the  TA  in  close  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment and the ASEAN Secretariat. ADB will leverage the AADMER\u2019s coordination function \nto ensure synergies and avoid overlap with other development partners. ADB\u2019s SDCC will select, \nsupervise, and evaluate consultants; organize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource \npersons in workshops.  \n \n19.
