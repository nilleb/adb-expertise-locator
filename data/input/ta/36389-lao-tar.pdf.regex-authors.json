The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) aims to achieve \neconomic growth, reduce poverty, and graduate from its least-developed country status by 2020. \nThe 2004\u20132006 Country Strategy and Planning (CSP)1 update reaffirms the priority given to \nstrengthening  governance  through  policy  and  institutional  development  as  key  to  poverty \nreduction in the Lao PDR. A critical component in strengthening governance is development of a \nlegal system that gives all citizens fair access to justice. Lack of an efficient and effective legal \nsystem not only constrains improvement in the country\u2019s overall governance, but also limits the \npotential for greater foreign investment inflows and private sector development.  \n \n2.    The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supported  the  establishment  of  a  commercial \ndivision of the civil court to deal with defaulting borrowers.2 Necessary rules of the court have \nbeen adopted, and judges and enforcement officers assigned to commercial divisions have \nundergone initial training. All 18 provinces have established a commercial division of the civil \ncourt and have begun hearing cases. However, there is substantial scope for continued training \nof court officials3 and court judgment enforcement officers, given their inexperience and lack of \nknowledge of commercial/financial activities. The Government has requested ADB to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA)4 that will continue to support the resolution of commercial disputes, \nincluding strengthening mediation and arbitration processes and commercial law-related court \nproceedings and will ensure fair and transparent judgments and speedy enforcement of court \ndecisions on defaulting financial/commercial transactions. Fully operationalizing the nascent \nsecured transactions registry will augment the legal system in resolving financial/commercial \ndisputes. The Fact-Finding Mission fielded to Vientiane, Lao PDR during 26\u201330 September \n2005 discussed the TA scope and implementation arrangements. The Government concurred \non  the  TA  paper,  including  the  purpose,  scope,  implementation,  cost  and  financing \narrangements. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Government strives to improve its legal system and recently promulgated a number \nof new laws (on Government, National Assembly, Local Administration, Land, Enforcement of \nJudicial Decisions, People\u2019s Court, and People\u2019s Judiciary Authority), but weak governance and \ncapacity continue to pose serious constraints. Lack of a reliable legal system for resolving \ndisputes arising from financial/commercial activities is a major obstacle in attracting foreign \ndirect investment and promoting private sector development. In particular, implications have \nbeen significant for the financial sector, where risks for commercial lending have been assessed \nas being exceptionally high due to deficiencies in the legal system, prohibiting expansion of \nbank lending. The ongoing Loan 1946-LAO (SF): Banking Sector Reform Program (BSRP)5 has \na component to mobilize the judiciary to apply a strengthened legal system and for the Bank of \nthe Lao PDR (BOL) to use an effective prudential system to bring failed borrowers, strategic \ndefaulters, and unsound banks to account. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Strengthening Governance for \nBanking Sector Reform. Manila (TA 4002-LAO, attached to Banking Sector Reform Program with the objective of \nsupporting implementation of the Program, includes a component to support legal and judicial strengthening). The \nTA was approved on 28 November for $900,000. \n3  Court officials include judges and court registry staff. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 11 November 2005.   \n5  On 28 November 2002, the ADB Board approved Loan 1946-LAO (SF): Banking Sector Reform Program for $15 \nmillion. The Program's objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to foster efficient financial intermediation \nand ensure a sound banking system capable of supporting growth and rural outreach. \n ", "2   \n4.  With the support of the International Monetary Fund, BOL regulations have gradually \nbeen upgraded. BOL now conducts regular off-site monitoring and on-site examinations on \nbanks operating in the Lao PDR. Under the BSRP, ADB supported the establishment of a \ncommercial division of the civil court to deal with defaulting borrowers (footnote 1). Preliminary \nrules  of  court  have  been  adopted,  and  judges  and  enforcement  officers  assigned  to  the \ncommercial division of the court have undergone initial training. The first commercial division of \nthe civil court was established in the civil chamber of the Vientiane municipality court on 1 July \n2003. Since then, all 18 provinces have established a commercial division and have begun \nhearing  cases.  However,  there  is  substantial  scope  for  continued  training  of  judges  and \nenforcement  officers,  given  their  limited  experience  and  lack  of  knowledge  of \ncommercial/financial activities.   \n \n5.  Despite the enactment of the Law on Enforcement of Judicial Decisions in May 2004, \njudgment enforcement remains one of the most problematic areas of the country\u2019s legal system. \nThe Government established the Division of Court for Judgment Execution in the Ministry of \nJustice (MOJ), but the division still lacks the capacity to monitor progress in enforcing judgment, \nparticularly at the provincial level. Constant delays and frequent mismanagement in judgment \nenforcement for settling commercial/financial disputes have been disruptive and are the cause \nof confusion in the marketplace. To enable efficient and effective enforcement of court judgment, \nthere is a need for establishing clear and standardized procedures to be adopted at all levels of \njudgment enforcement, continued training for enforcement officers, and awareness building \namong the public.  \n \n6.  In liquidating assets held as loan collateral, inexperience and lack of an established \nprocedure have resulted in unfair pricing and ambiguous transactions, further eroding public \nconfidence in the newly established system. For auctioning assets held as collateral, there \nneeds to be a clear set of procedures that ensure transparency and fairness to all parties \nconcerned. The Notary Office created by MOJ in 2000 in accordance with the law on notaries is \ncurrently unable to complete the required tasks of certifying or witnessing the accuracy of sales, \nloans,  other  business-related  contracts,  testimonies,  copies  of  documents,  signatures,  and \ntranslations. Clearly there is a need to now review and assess the various components of the \nlegal system that impede commercial dispute resolution. A well-sequenced plan needs to be \nformulated  to  ensure  that  the  commercial  division  of  the  court  functions  as  expected  and \nprovides  the  legal  means  for  expeditious  resolution  of  defaulting  financial  and commercial \ntransactions. \n \n7.  Insufficient  capacity  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  legal  system  has  also  hindered  the \ncommercial division from functioning effectively. Requirements for standard loan and other \ncommercial transaction documentation and knowledge of the legal procedures are lacking, \nparticularly the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). Bank operations suffer from sizable \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) with little prospects for resolution. The SOCBs have no legal \ndepartments and lack staff with basic legal background or training. Supporting capacity building \nof the beneficiaries of the legal system, the SOCBs in particular, will improve governance in the \nfinancial/commercial  system,  consistent  with  the  thrust  of  Loan  1946-LAO  (footnote  4)  for \nfinancial sector development. \n \n8.  The  Government  has  also  established  the  Office  of  Economic  Dispute  Resolution \n(OEDR)6 under MOJ in Vientiane, with branches in Savannakhet and Luang Prabang, for \nmediation and arbitration in cases of economic disputes arising primarily from breaches of \n                                                 \n6  Operating under Decree106/PM on the resolution of economic disputes, dated 17 July 1994 and Arbitration Law \n2005. ", "  3\ncontracts.  Given  that  informal  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  are  the  preferred  means  for \ndispute  resolution  in  the  country,  the  potential  role  of  the  OEDR  is  significant.  With  the \npromulgation  of  the  Arbitration  Act  in  August  2005,  the  time  and  expenses  related  to \ncommercial/financial  dispute  resolution  may  be  reduced  considerably  by  enhancing  the \noperations of OEDR. The mediators and arbitrators also will benefit from additional training on \nnewly issued commercial/financial laws and regulations, and OEDR\u2019s function and use could be \nbetter promoted in the private sector, raising awareness of the OEDR as a quick and viable \nalternative to court proceedings.   \n \n9.  The Secured Transactions Law and its implementing decree are the major components \nof financial governance and are fundamental in mobilizing domestic credit and international \ninvestment in Lao PDR. The implementation of the secured transactions regime, including the \nSecured Transactions Law, its Decree, and the secured transactions registry, would create an \nenabling environment for private financing, especially at a time when Lao PDR is seeking to join \nthe World Trade Organization (WTO)7, and is in the process of initiating the Nam Theun 2 \nhydroelectric project. The revised and upgraded Secured Transactions Law was submitted to \nand approved by the National Assembly on 20 May 2005. The draft implementing decree will be \ndeveloped  in  February  2006.  To  ensure  the  widespread  utilization  of  the  Law,  and  the \ndevelopment  of  a  secured  transactions  regime,  supporting  capacity  building  and  training \nseminars would be required for the financial, commercial, and judicial sectors in Lao PDR. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA aims to strengthen the formal and informal mechanisms for commercial dispute \nresolution so as to ensure predictable, transparent, and speedy resolution supported, where \nneeded, by court judgments effectively enforced. A reliable system for commercial dispute \nresolution in accordance with the rule of law and a fully operationalized secured transactions \nregistry will reduce the risk of doing business in the Lao PDR and thereby facilitate foreign direct \ninvestment and private sector development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA comprises four components: \n \n(i)  The first component will review current operations of the commercial division of \nthe court to identify key impediments hindering its effective functioning. The study \nwill  recommend  specific  and  practical  measures  for  resolving  the  identified \nimpediments.  The  recommendations  will  be  sequenced  and  prioritized,  and \ncontain  cost  estimates.  The  first  phase  of  the  recommendations,  which  will \ninclude  capacity  building  for  the  Notary  Public  Office  and  enhancement  of \nenforcement procedures including clarifying procedures for auctioning of assets \nheld as collateral, will be completed under the TA. This component will also \nreview  and  develop  the  self-help  procedures  and  arbitration  and  mediation \nalternatives available to disputing parties in the first instance, prior to recourse to \nthe courts. A public awareness program will be developed to assist the private \nsector to better understand and use the dispute resolution mechanisms and \nlitigation rights available to them.  \n                                                 \n7   Four GMS countries\u2013\u2013Cambodia, PRC, Myanmar, and Thailand\u2013\u2013are now members of WTO, with Lao PDR and \nViet Nam in the process of negotiating WTO membership. \n ", "4   \n(ii)  The second component will undertake further capacity building for the judiciary \nand  trainers  by  conducting  the  next  training  series  for  court  officials  and \nenforcement  officers  assigned  to  the  commercial  division  of  the  court.  The \ntraining program will build on the three series of training completed under TA \n4002-LAO  (footnote  1).  Emphasis  will  be  on  court  proceedings  and  case \nmanagement using actual cases filed at the commercial division of the court, \nparticularly those related to defaulting financial and commercial transactions. The \ntraining  will  extend  to  related  commercial  dealings  and  will  give  priority  to \ndeveloping local training expertise. \n(iii)  The third component will operationalize a secured transactions regime in Lao \nPDR  and  thus  create  an  enabling  environment  to  increase  availability, \naffordability, and transparency of credit access, as well as facilitate domestic and \ncross-border  investment.  The  main  output  will  be  an  operational  secured \ntransactions  registry  and  capacity  building  modules  to  support  the \nimplementation of the secured transactions regime. The establishment of the \nsecured transactions registry and capacity building modules will also seek to \ninvolve  other  funding  agencies  and  thus  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the \ntraining modules outside the major urban areas of Luang Prabang, Pakse, and \nVientiane. \n(iv)  The final component will support the two SOCBs in (a) setting up or enhancing \nthe legal departments to implement standard loan and commercial transaction \ndocumentation, the dispute resolution mechanisms, and for filing NPL cases for \ncourt decisions; and (b) supporting the internal asset management units (work-\nout units) for resolution of NPLs.  \n \n12.  Capacity building efforts rely heavily on adequate understanding of the current state of \naffairs, operational constraints, and appropriately matching the level of training materials to the \nbeneficiaries. The review of the current operations of the commercial division of the court in the \nfirst component is expected to enable the consultants to become sufficiently aware of the \ncurrent training needs and reduce the risk of preparing training materials unsuitable for the Lao \nPDR. Furthermore, successful implementation of the TA assumes that judges and enforcement \nofficers assigned to the commercial divisions of the court are made available for training. Both \nPeople\u2019s Supreme Court and MOJ have given their assurances that all judges and enforcement \nofficers assigned to the commercial division will be made available for all training sessions to be \nconducted under the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $780,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $650,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost of \n$525,000 and $125,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis,  $500,000  by  ADB's  TA  funding  program  and  $150,000  by  the  Government  of \nLuxembourg, with the latter amount administered by ADB. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $130,000, through the provision of counterpart \nstaff salaries, office accommodation and transport, support services, and the facilitation of \nconsultations. Appendix 2 provides details of the cost estimates and financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOJ will be the Executing Agency. Implementing agencies (IAs) will be the Ministry of \nFinance, the People\u2019s Supreme Court, BOL, Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao (BCEL), \nand Lao Development Bank (LDB). They will provide office space, counterpart staff, and other ", "  5\nsupport services to the consultants. MOJ and People\u2019s Supreme Court will ensure that relevant \nenforcement officers and judges are freed from their daily tasks to attend the training sessions. \nMOJ and the IAs will be responsible for (i) selecting of the trainers for training; (ii) monitoring \nthat the quality of the training materials produced under the TA is appropriate for the operating \nenvironment of the Lao PDR, together with ADB; and (iii) continuing the training program \nfollowing TA completion. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 10 months, from May 2006 to March 2007, and will \nrequire the service of six international (19.5 person-months) and six domestic consultants (25 \nperson-months). The international consultants (person-months are in parentheses) comprise \ngovernance and judicial training expert-team leader (4), an enforcement expert (2), a mediation \nand  arbitration  expert  (2),  legal  expert  (3),  secured  transactions  expert  (5)  and  an  NPL \nresolution (legal) expert (3.5). The domestic consultants will have expertise in governance and \njudicial  training  (5),  enforcement  (2.5),  mediation  and  arbitration  (2.5),  legal  (4),  secured \ntransactions (6), and NPL resolution (5). All consultants will work intermittently over the TA \nimplementation period.  \n \n16.  As outlined in the terms of reference (Appendix 3), the consultant team will produce \nvarious reports each of which will be discussed at the tripartite meetings. Aside from the training \nmaterials  under  the  responsibility of  each  international consultant,  the  team  leader  will be \nresponsible for submitting the inception report to MOJ and IAs, and ADB, which will include a \ndiagnostic study and implementation plan for the capacity-building exercise, approximately 2 \nweeks after the international consultants are fielded. A midterm report will be prepared after \ncompleting the first round of training sessions. A final report, containing recommendations for \nfurther actions by the Government and specific areas requiring continued technical assistance, \nwill be prepared 2 weeks before completion of the TA.  \n \n17.  The consultants will be engaged through a firm following the quality- and cost-based \nselection  process  and  using  a  simplified  technical  proposal.  The  consultant  team  will  be \nselected according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  of  consultants.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Various training seminars and workshops \nwill  be  held  to  encourage  participatory  discussions  for  improving  court  proceedings  at  the \ncommercial division of the civil court and judgment enforcement, and for building the capacity of \nall staff levels within the relevant government agencies and SOCBs. There will also be close \ncoordination  during  TA  implementation  with  external  funding  agencies  involved  in  judicial \nreforms. The final report of the TA and all training materials produced will be disseminated to all \nstakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $150,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Luxembourg, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Promoting Governance in Financial Transactions, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nHigher confidence in  \u2022 15% increase in the  Government/aid agency  \u2022 Stable macroeconomic \nthe legal system of the  number of disputes  data and reports on  conditions in the Lao PDR \nLao PDR, improving  brought to the court  development of the legal  \u2022 Steady economic growth in \ngovernance and  and OEDR for  system, foreign direct  the region and in countries \npotential for economic  resolving defaulting  investment, and private  of  Lao PDR\u2019s trading \ngrowth  commercial/financial  sector activities  partners \ntransactions, \n\u2022 10% increase in the \nlevel of foreign direct \ninvestment, and  \n\u2022 20% increase in the \nlevel of private sector \ncontribution to GDP \ngrowth  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened formal  30% increase in the  Reports by the Ministry of  \u2022 Commitment of the \nand informal  number of satisfactorily  Justice and People\u2019s  Government \nmechanisms for dispute  resolved disputes on  Supreme Court  \u2022 Effective coordination \nresolution on defaulting   defaulting    among all stakeholders \ncommercial/financial  commercial/financial  Final TA report  concerned  \ntransactions  transactions     Risk \n      \u2022 Insufficient number of \nTo assist the Lao PDR  Use of secured   \ncases actually filed with \nin the implementation of  transactions registry by \nthe commercial division of \na secured transactions  the private sector \nthe court and OEDR \nregime \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
