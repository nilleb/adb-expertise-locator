INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  Timor-Leste  pursue \neconomic  integration  into  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  regional \ncommunity and the World Trade Organization (WTO) multilateral trading system. The support will \nbe  provided  through  (i)  enhanced  regulatory  compliance  with  ASEAN  and  the  WTO, \n(ii) strengthened institutional capacity, and (iii) promotion of private sector support. The TA is \nincluded in the country operations business plan for Timor-Leste, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Timor-Leste aims to diversify its economy. Diversifying from its current reliance on the \npetroleum sector is imperative for Timor-Leste and is a key goal of its Strategic Development Plan, \n2011\u20132030.2 In 2018, the top two merchandise exports of Timor-Leste were petroleum and coffee, \nwhich together accounted for about 74% of total exports.3 The oil sector dominates the country\u2019s \neconomy and yet oil revenues have limited lifespans. Private investment in the non-oil sector has \nfocused on serving demand created by public spending. Private investment in the productive \neconomy is needed to generate new sources of income and to create jobs for the country\u2019s \nexpanding population. Achieving export growth and diversification is also essential to support \nsustainable economic growth. Policies to expand exports will impact positively on domestic trade \nas well. \n \n3.  Integration as vehicle to diversify the economy. Timor-Leste has a liberal trade policy \nregime. As a least-developed and fragile and conflict-affected country, it will continue to receive \npreferential tariff treatment from major markets. Despite this, the country is still experiencing trade \ndeficit and limited investment in potential export sectors. Becoming a member of the WTO and \nthe ASEAN will bring trade and investment regulations up to regional and multilateral standards \nand increase the transparency of these regulations. Thus, it will improve the enabling environment \nfor business and investment, support domestic and international investment in productive sectors \nand create opportunities for greater engagement in regional value chains. It will also give the \nGovernment of Timor-Leste greater leverage in the development of multilateral and/or regional \ntrade policy directions. \n \n4.  Association of Southeast Asian Nations and World Trade Organization responses \nto the coronavirus disease pandemic. Participation in regional policy coordination has become \ncritical  to  mitigate  and  isolate  the  impact  of  the  ongoing  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic. Both ASEAN and the WTO have been active in undertaking coordination on this matter. \nTwo summits\u2014the Special ASEAN Summit on COVID-19 and the Special ASEAN Plus Three \nSummit on COVID-19 (including Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina)\u2014were quickly convened to agree on the collaboration required to address COVID-19. The \nWTO has also established a dedicated page on its website that provides up-to-the-minute trade-\nrelated information, including relevant notifications by WTO members, the impact the virus has \nhad on exports and imports, and how WTO activities have been affected by the pandemic. The \nadditional measures decided by ASEAN at the two summits will make their members better \nprepared for future pandemics and minimize disruptions to trade and global value chains. \n \n1  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Timor-Leste, 2020\u20132022. Manila. The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 July 2020. \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011. Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030. Dili. \n3  Annual  merchandise  trade  matrix  \u2013  detailed  products,  exports  in  thousands  of  United  States  dollars. \nhttps://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=24738 (accessed 12 April 2020). \n ", "2 \nEnhanced  participation  of  Timor-Leste  at  ASEAN  and  WTO-related  forums,  and  eventual \nmembership  in  ASEAN  and  the  WTO,  will  therefore  help  Timor-Leste  prepare  for  similar \npandemics. \n \n5.  The  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  and  World  Trade  Organization \naccession processes. The ASEAN commitments are aligned with those of the WTO, although \nthe ASEAN goes beyond in its approach to liberalization. Efforts to enhance the regulatory \nenvironment for ASEAN membership will also be supporting Timor-Leste\u2019s WTO accession. \nASEAN established the ASEAN Coordinating Council Working Group  Meeting on Timor-Leste\u2019s \nASEAN membership while WTO established the Working Party for Timor-Leste accession, and \nconsultations with both are ongoing.4 However, the accession process will require Timor-Leste to \ndemonstrate its capacity to implement new policies and institutional reforms. The cost of such \nadjustments requires investments in obtaining expert advice, upgrading skills, developing new \nsystems, and adopting new technology. \n \n6.  Preparation of the private sector for economic integration. Timor-Leste has been \neager to adopt reforms to strengthen the country\u2019s ability to promote private sector-led growth \nand participate in the global economy.5 Ratification and implementation of the commitments under \nASEAN and the WTO will signal that Timor-Leste is committed to maintaining liberal policies for \ntrade and investment, which can significantly reduce the risk for foreign businesses and lead to \nincreased foreign direct investment. However, it is important to ensure that the private sector is \nfamiliar with the new commitments of Timor-Leste under ASEAN and the WTO and is able to reap \nthe associated opportunities. Timor-Leste should also facilitate the private sector\u2019s expansion of \ntheir international and regional business networks. \n \n7.  Nascent institutional trade policy structure. The institutional structure for developing \nand coordinating trade policy in Timor-Leste is still at a nascent stage and exhibits capacity \nconstraints. Addressing trade-related issues and developing an international trade strategy will \nrequire solid institutional foundations. However, agencies that are nominally responsible for \ninternational trade policy may have little authority over the policies that are most important to trade. \nWith ADB\u2019s support, Timor-Leste conducted a capacity building assessment of ministries involved \nin the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which addressed funding and TA gaps.6 The Public \nAdministrative Reform Program, 2019\u20132023 provides a pathway for mainstreaming required \nreforms.7  \n \n8.  Continuation of ADB\u2019s support during a critical juncture. ADB has been supporting \nTimor-Leste\u2019s preparation for regional integration since 2012.8 This long-standing support has \nearned the government\u2019s trust, which is required for policy advisory work and created momentum \nfor  regional  integration  through,  among  others,  the  development  of  Timor-Leste\u2019s  ASEAN \n \n4  Timor-Leste applied for ASEAN membership in March 2011 and WTO membership in April 2015. \n5  The reforms include adoption of electronic data interchange of customs information, development of a national single \nwindow, preparation of negative lists for investment, and commencement of the first exchange of traffic rights \nmemorandum of understanding with Indonesia. \n6  ADB. 2016.

This, however, presents a challenge for the government in ensuring that gaps \nare addressed to become an ASEAN member state. ADB\u2019s continued support is therefore critical. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Timor-Leste becomes a member of ASEAN \n(footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: Timor-Leste\u2019s ability to meet regional \n(ASEAN) and multilateral (WTO) accession requirements improved.11 The TA is also aligned with \noperational priority 7 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (fostering regional cooperation and integration) by \npromoting  trade  and  investment  opportunities  through  the  implementation  of  regional  and \nmultilateral agreements. The TA will also seek to measure the potential impact and benefits of \nlonger-term reforms to inform subsequent sovereign or private sector investment.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Regulatory environment enhanced. Building on the CEA position paper and \nthe technical position paper developed under the ongoing TA (footnote 6), this output will \n(i) facilitate deliberations between Timor-Leste and ASEAN member states to identify mutually \nagreed priorities for ASEAN accession, (ii) develop a road map for the country\u2019s technical \nreadiness for the AEC with a clear timeline and milestones, and (iii) provide necessary policy and \ntechnical advice for the implementation of the road map. The road map for technical readiness to \nbe developed under this TA will cover a broad range of areas in line with ASEAN commitments. \nSince both ASEAN and the WTO are gender-conscious, this output would also introduce the \nmainstreaming of gender perspective and analysis in the regulatory reforms supported by the \nTA.13 The project will develop a strategy to evaluate the impact of trade reforms on women and \n \ngender  inequalities  prior  to  the  implementation  of  such  reforms.14 The  TA  will  convene \ndevelopment partner meetings to coordinate the implementation of the road map.15 The TA will \n \n9  Timor-Leste\u2019s ASEAN Mobilization Program maps the key binding ASEAN agreements across Timor-Leste\u2019s \ngovernment agencies to identify how each line agency corresponds to the ASEAN work program, including an \nindicative list of relevant ASEAN agreements and meetings. \n10 CEA\u2019s focus on issues in ASEAN agreements, which require legally binding commitments on concessional \narrangements to be extended to ASEAN member states. A technical position paper providing deeper analysis as \nwell as recommendations on possible negotiation parameters with ASEAN member states would be developed for \neach of the CEAs. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n13 In 2017, ASEAN adopted the ASEAN Declaration on the Gender-Responsive Implementation of the ASEAN \nCommunity Vision 2025 and Sustainable Development Goals. The WTO frames and structures its actions based on \nfour objectives: (i) raising awareness on the link between trade and gender, (ii) facilitating WTO members' action on \ntrade and gender, (iii) generating new data on the impact of trade on women, and (iv) providing training to government \nofficials and women entrepreneurs. \n14 For example, the United Nations Conference and Trade Development methodology toolbox may be used. \n15 Some key development partners of ASEAN have approached the Government of Timor-Leste and ADB about \npossible collaboration to support Timor-Leste\u2019s accession to ASEAN. A meeting of development partners will be \nconvened upon finalization of the road map to determine which activities will be funded and/or supported by each \ndevelopment partner, and regular meetings will be convened for coordination of the road map implementation. \n ", "4 \nalso coordinate with other relevant ADB programs, such as the TA to Indonesia for cross-border \ntrade and cooperation.16 \n \n11.  Output 2: Institutional capacity strengthened. The TA will implement the findings of the \ncapacity building assessment of ministries involved in the AEC (para. 7). The TA will also conduct \nadditional assessments to identify trainings required to support the WTO accession process. \nActivities under this output will help strengthen institutional capacity by equipping the government \nwith (i) adequately trained focal points across all line ministries on related legal and regulatory \nreforms, (ii) institutions adequately equipped with resources to actively participate in discussions \ncentral to the process of regional integration, (iii) professionally trained trade and investment \nexperts in the medium to long term, (iv) ASEAN- and WTO-sensitive programming in all line \nministries, and (v) in-house trainers to train its own government staff on the WTO and/or ASEAN \nengagement. \n \n12.  Output 3: Private sector awareness and readiness on the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations and the World Trade Organization supported. Activities under this output will \nfocus on WTO/ASEAN awareness and training for the private sector and/or representatives of \nprivate  sector  organizations.  The  training  will  help  the  private  sector  to  (i)  formulate  a \ncomprehensive understanding of the frameworks of ASEAN and the WTO; (ii) have an in-depth \nunderstanding of the implications for Timor-Leste following ASEAN accession and in preparation \nfor  WTO  accession;  (iii)  identify  support  required  for  the  private  sector  to  avail  itself  of \nopportunities arising from ASEAN and WTO accession; and (iv) facilitate business matchmaking \nbetween Timor-Leste\u2019s private sector and other countries\u2019 private sectors throughout ASEAN (if \nrequired).  The  activities  also  aim  to  strengthen  existing  public\u2013private  sector  dialogue  in \nTimor-Leste through the delivery of the planned activities, to the extent possible. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,575,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6) and (ii) $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.17 The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, supplies, secretarial \nassistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Regional Integration Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation will \nbe the executing agency.18 It will chair the TA steering committee, with implementing agencies \nand other relevant stakeholders as members. The committee will meet biannually to report on \nand discuss TA outputs. The implementing agencies will be the (i) Ministry of Tourism, Commerce \nand Industry; and (ii) Customs Department, Ministry of Finance. \n \n \n16 ADB. 2019.
