During  the  country  program  midterm  review  conducted  in  November  2005,  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) for establishment of the Clean Development Mechanism \nFund (the CDM Fund) in the PRC.1 At the request of the Government, ADB sent a mission to \nthe PRC to undertake reconnaissance about the CDM Fund from 18 to 20 January 2006. \nNational  experts  were  engaged  as  staff  consultants  to  provide  a  background  analysis \nconcerning the institutional structure and operational modalities of the proposed CDM Fund. A \njoint review meeting was held at ADB on 15\u201317 February 2006 between the Government, ADB \nand staff consultants to discuss the consultant report. Based on findings of the reconnaissance \nmission and staff consultants\u2019 study, the ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC from 4 to 7 \nApril 2006 and reached agreement with the Government regarding the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. \nThe TA project design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  PRC  signed  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change \n(UNFCCC) in 1991, and ratified the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC in 2002. As a developing \nparticipating country of the UNFCCC, the PRC is eligible to benefit from the Clean Development \nMechanism (CDM) established under Kyoto Protocol; the validity of the CDM currently extends \nuntil  2012.  The  CDM  is  designed  to  promote  a  win-win  solution  between  developed  and \ndeveloping countries in addressing global climate change. The CDM allows the developed \ncountries listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC to fulfill their greenhouse gas (GHG) emission \nreduction obligations through investment or participation in GHG emission reduction projects in \ndeveloping countries, where the costs for emission reduction are relatively low. By obtaining \ncertified  emission  reduction  (CERs)  from  projects  located  in  developing  countries,  the \ndeveloped  countries  can  meet  their  GHG  emission  reduction  targets  at  lower  cost,  while \npromoting sustainable development in developing countries.   \n \n3.  It  is  estimated  that  the  PRC  could  implement  GHG  reduction  projects  that  would \nannually generate CER credits equal to 151 to 225 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent2. \nBased on an estimated $10 per million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, this represents a \npotential annual CER revenue stream of $1.51 billion to $2.25 billion. According to a World \nBank-sponsored study,3 the PRC has the potential to generate about 50% of the total worldwide \nannual CERs. These potential benefits need to be achieved through the CDM, by means of \nCER transactions between the project owners in the PRC and their counterparts from the \ndeveloped countries. The Government regards the CDM as an important mechanism to (i) gain \nfinancial support and new technology from developed countries to complement its own efforts to \npromote sustainable development, and (ii) address climate change concerns on both a national \nand  global  basis.  The  Government  has  established  an  inter-ministerial  national  policy \ncoordination group, headed by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), to \nprovide  oversight  for  policy  development  and  decision  making  on  climate  change-related \nactivities.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 April 2006. \n2  ADB  Staff  Consultants.  February  2006.  Clean  Development  Fund  (CDF)  Consultants  Consolidated  Report, \nunpublished. \n3   World Bank. 2004. Clean Development Mechanism in China. Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \n4.  While recognizing the potential benefits the CDM can generate for the country, the \nGovernment has noted two general concerns related to CER transactions under the CDM: (i) \ncertain CDM projects (e.g., hydrofluorocarbon [HFC] projects that are designed to capture and \ndestroy  HFC  emissions  by  the  manufacturing  sector)  have  a  high  value  in  terms  of  CER \nrevenues, but contribute less to sustainable development; and (ii) high CER market values \ncould serve as a perverse incentive, stimulating operation of and further investment in polluting \nindustries. To address these concerns, on 12 October 2005 the Government issued a decree, \n\u201cMeasures on Operation and Management of Clean Development Mechanism Projects\u201d (Decree \n37). Decree 37 has introduced a levy on the CER revenues generated by various CDM projects \nin the PRC;4 the fees collected by the Government will be used to support domestic climate \nchange-related activities. It also states that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will develop, in \nconsultation with the NDRC, detailed regulations and operational guidelines for collecting and \nusing the resources mobilized through this levy.  \n \n5.  In accordance with Decree 37, the Government will establish a specialized facility\u2014the \nCDM Fund\u2014to manage the fees collected from CDM projects. Furthermore, the CDM Fund may \nalso  receive  technical  assistance  and  other  grant  support  from  external  funding  agencies, \nincluding ADB and the World Bank. These resources will be supplemented by donations and \noperational income. CDM Fund resources will be used to promote domestic CDM projects and \nother climate change-related mitigation and adaptation projects and activities, through provision \nof technical assistance, grant support, and loans. The CDM Fund will be operated under the \nguidance  of  a  governing  council  comprising  the  NDRC,  MOF,  Ministry  of  Science  and \nTechnology, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the Governing Council).  \n \n6.  The  levy  introduced  under  Decree  37  is  generally  welcomed  by  the  international \ncommunity  as  an  innovation  to  further  enhance  the  rationale  and  integrity  of  CDM  as  a \npartnership  to  promote  sustainable  development.  The  World  Bank  has  agreed  to  support \npreparation of the CDM Fund by (i) providing staff consultants to prepare the draft operational \nstrategy for the CDM Fund, and (ii) making available limited seed money through advance \npayment  for  CERs  purchased  under  its  Prototype  Carbon  Fund.  The  Government  has \nrequested  TA  from  ADB  to  assist  in  designing  the  governance  structure  and  operational \nmechanism of the CDM Fund, in line with international experiences and best practices.   \n \n7.  ADB has been providing ongoing support to the PRC for CDM capacity development \nand has implemented a number of early CDM projects. In 2002, ADB implemented TA 3840-\nPRC: Opportunities for the Clean Development Mechanism in the Energy Sector.5 Under TA \n5972-REG:  Promotion  of  Renewable  Energy,  Energy  Efficiency  and  Greenhouse  Gas \nAbatement (PREGA), ADB prepared CDM documentation for six projects in the PRC. In 2005, \nthe ADB CDM Facility successfully brokered the CER credits from Loan 2112-PRC Liaoning \nEnvironment Improvement Project. ADB also supported CDM development for Loan 2146-PRC \nCoalmine  Methane  Development  and  Loan  2032-PRC  Gansu  Clean  Energy  Development \nProjects. ADB is currently preparing the Carbon Market Initiative, which will provide innovative \nCDM financing for ADB-assisted projects. It is envisaged that the Carbon Market Initiative and \nthe CDM Fund would complement each other in promoting CDM projects in the PRC. \n  \n                                                 \n4  According to Decree 37, the Government will collect 65% of revenues from the sale of CERs produced by HFC and \nperfluorocarbon (PFC) emission reduction projects, 30% from nitrous oxide (N O) projects and 2% from projects of \n2\nnational priority, including projects that focus on energy efficiency, new and renewable energy, the capture of coal \nmine and coal bed methane, and that support small scale reforestration. \n5  ADB. 2005.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be sustainable development in the PRC and support for \ninternational efforts to address climate change. Its outcome will be an increase in the number of \nCDM projects and other climate change-related mitigation and adaptation projects and activities \nin the PRC. The TA will help the Government establish the CDM Fund, with an appropriately \ndesigned  governance  structure  and  initial  operational  capacity,  in  further  pursuit  of  this \ndevelopment goal. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will assist the Government address key governance and operational concerns of \nthe CDM Fund, through the following four major components: \n \n(i)  Component A: study and introduction of CDM fee collection mechanism. \nUnder  this  component,  the  TA  will  provide  consulting  services  to  help  (a) \nexamine the applicable accounting laws and principles and various government \nfee collection mechanisms; (b) propose operational alternatives for a CDM fee \ncollection  mechanism  for  the  CDM  Fund;  (c)  prepare  the  draft  decree  or \nregulations,  as  applicable,  for  the  CDM  fee  collection  mechanism;  and  (d) \nconduct  consultation  with  stakeholders  as  part  of  a  participatory  consensus-\nbuilding process. \n  \n(ii)  Component  B:  CDM  fund  governance  structure  and  capacity  building. \nUnder this component, the TA will (a) design and establish the internal control \nand  governance  structure  of  the  CDM  Fund  (including  auditing  and  anti-\ncorruption  systems);  (b)  conduct  targeted  external  consultations  with  the \nUNFCCC Secretariat concerning registration procedures for CER transactions, \nand undertake a study tour to selected countries to visit potential CER buyers, \nand to gain an understanding of international experiences and best practices in \nthe management of environment funds; (c) provide essential facilities, including a \nserver and basic work stations, for a computer-based management information \nsystem for the CDM Fund; and (d) provide a training program for the staff of the \nCDM Fund and relevant local government officials.  \n  \n(iii)  Component C: CDM fund operations manual. Under this component, the TA \nwill review the proposed operational strategy for the CDM Fund and prepare the \nmanual guiding its day-to-day operation. \n \n(iv)  Component D: information dissemination and awareness program. Under \nthis  component,  the  TA  will  organize  conferences  and  provide  support  for \npreparation  of  information  dissemination  and  public  awareness  materials, \nincluding a specialized website to promote awareness and support for climate \nchange  activities  in  general,  and  to  promote  operation  of  the  CDM  Fund  in \nparticular. \n \n10.  The major deliverables of the TA include (i) the draft decree and/or regulations on the \nCDM fee collection mechanism, (ii) a draft policy paper guiding the CDM Fund internal control \nand governance structure, (iii) a draft operations manual for the CDM Fund, (iv) a computer-\n ", "4   \nbased operational management information system, (v) training materials for capacity building, \nand (vi) materials (including a special website) for the information dissemination and public \nawareness program. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $800,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  TA  Funding  Program.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  TA  costs, \nequivalent to $200,000, through the provision of in-kind contributions in the form of office space \nand facilities and salaries of counterpart staff. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare provided in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and has designated a senior official at \nthe deputy director general level as the project director, who is responsible for daily decision \nmaking on behalf of the Government. The Governing Council (para. 5) will serve as the inter-\nministerial  steering  committee  to  provide  guidance  and  policy  coordination  support  for  TA \nimplementation. The CDM Fund Preparation Office (CDMFPO), established by the MOF, will \nserve as the project management office for the TA. The CDMFPO has designated a senior \nofficial, with extensive operational experience in handling international projects, as the chief \noperation coordinator. They will supervise and coordinate all activities, including consulting \nservices supported by the TA under different components.  \n \n13.  The TA will provide 6 person-months of international consulting services in the areas of \nfinancial institution management (2 person-months) and fund management (4 person-months). \nThe international consultants will be actively involved in developing the draft policy paper to \ndesign  the  governance  structure  and  internal  control  system  of  the  CDM  Fund  and  in \nformulating the draft operations manual. The TA will provide 24 person-months of national \nconsulting services in the areas of project management (4 person-months), project financial \nmanagement (4 person-months), PRC taxation law (3 person-months), taxation accounting (3 \nperson-months),  fund  management  (2  person-months),  corporate  management  (4  person-\nmonths),  CDM  transactions  (2  person-months),  and  legal  counsel  (2  person-months).  The \nnational consultants will be involved, to various extents and as appropriate, in implementing the \nfour  major  TA  components  (para.  9).  All  the  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  on  an \nindividual  basis,  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers. Interdisciplinary cooperation and coordination among the \nconsultants  will  be  managed  by  the  Executing  Agency  through  CDMFPO.  The  individual \nconsultant selection and recruitment method is recommended because few consulting firms, \ninternational  or  national,  are  known  to  have  the  ability  to  organize  a  team  of  in-house \nprofessionals with such diversified expertise. Given the strong capacity of the Executing Agency \nand the designated project management office, a CDMFPO-led team of individually engaged \nconsultants is considered the most efficient and effective arrangement for implementing the TA. \nOutline terms of reference for the consulting services are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  provide  the  necessary  hardware  (including  one  server  and  associated \nworkstations for the CDM Fund Preparation Office), and related technical support for software \ndevelopment, to help the Government establish a computer-based management information \nsystem for the CDM Fund operation and launch a website-based information dissemination and \n ", "  5\nawareness program. The equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines and transferred to the Government upon completion of the TA.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months beginning on 01 August 2006, \nwith a scheduled completion date of 30 July 2007. Information on implementation progress and \nTA outputs will be disseminated through the TA information dissemination and awareness \nprogram, including the special website that is to be developed. The outcome of the TA will be \nsubject to evaluation by both ADB and the Government, in accordance with their respective \nevaluation policies and requirements.  \n \nIV.
