INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in Basic Education Project is \nincluded in the Uzbekistan Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132006, with project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) programmed for 2005. In August 2004, the Government \nrequested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) advance the processing of the project in \nsupport of implementing the National Program for Basic Education Development 2004\u20132009, \nunveiled in May 2004. A fact-finding mission visited Uzbekistan in October 2004, and reached \nagreement  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  goal,  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, cost and financing plan, and outline terms of reference for consulting services.1 A \npreliminary project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Expanding  ICT  is  a  strategic  priority  of  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  to  develop  the \neconomy  and  increase  the  people\u2019s  well-being.2  An  information-  and  knowledge-based \neconomy will enable Uzbekistan to benefit fully from a global economy that is becoming ever \nmore  integrated.  Such  an  economy  will  enhance  Uzbekistan\u2019s  competitiveness  within  the \nCentral Asia region.3  The Government has made considerable efforts since the new millennium \nto realize this national aspiration. Achievements include development of a national ICT strategy \nin 2002, and issuance of a number of decrees and resolutions to guide strategy implementation \nand set up the necessary agencies and regulatory framework.4 While Uzbekistan scores high on \neducation-related Millennium Development Goals, with a net enrolment ratio at 99% and no \nmajor gender differentials,5 basic education is often of low quality and relevance. International \nexperience shows that appropriate use of ICT helps students score high on achievement tests, \nlearn more in less time, and develop positive attitudes toward their classes and learning.6 \nUzbekistan sees integrating ICT into learning and teaching as a key to achieving its sector \nreform objective of improving the quality and relevance of basic education.  \n \n3.  Education is designated as a key sector in implementing the national ICT strategy, which \naims to reach a computer-student ratio of 1:20 and provide Internet access to 63% of all schools \nby 2010. Currently, the computer-student ratio is about 1:110, and only 0.2% schools have \nInternet access.7 Over 80% of equipment is outdated. Computers are insufficient even for \ncomputer classes, let alone for broader integration of ICT into the curriculum. Only 50% of \nschools offer computer classes, and many have no access to computer equipment. A recent \nreport8 noted that Uzbekistan is at a very early stage of ICT development, with reference to key \nindicators measuring (i) share of subjects studied with the use of ICT in the total number of \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 September 2004. \n2  National Program for Development of Computerization, and Information and Communications Technologies, 2002\u2013\n2010, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 6 June 2002 and amended in December 2003. \n3  Uzbekistan lags considerably behind Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation in terms of the number and growth \nrate of personal computers per 100 people. (Revin, D. 2001. E-Readiness Assessment of Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan). \n4  Including the establishment of the National Steering Council for the Development of Computer and Information and \nCommunications Technologies, and the Uzbek Communication and Informatization Agency.  \n5  However, attendance is a problem, although reliable data are not available. Relevance of education may be among \nthe factors that have affected school attendance. \n6  Asian Development Bank. 2004.

The report uses a rating scheme from 1 to 4, with 4 being \nthe highest. Uzbekistan scores 1 on each of the three indicators cited above.  \n ", "2  \nsubjects, (ii) percentage of students and teachers using distance learning at schools, and (iii) \ntraining staff and teachers in ICT.  \n \n4.  Need for an ICT Development Strategy in Basic Education. There is wide agreement \namong Government agencies that ICT should be used not only to improve computer literacy but \nalso,  more important,  to  improve  the  quality and  relevance  of  basic  education in  general. \nHowever, how the national ICT strategy\u2019s goals can be achieved by 2010 is not articulated. \nImportant issues relating to the institutional and policy implications for education, infrastructure \ndevelopment and hardware provision, the substantial resource implications for sustainability, \nand the advantages and disadvantages of various options should be understood. A full-fledged \nICT development strategy should be developed for basic education.  \n \n5.  Curriculum,  Testing,  and  Content  Development.  Applying  ICT  in  teaching  and \nlearning will require revising the curriculum and developing new syllabi. The current curriculum \nand syllabi show little concern with the development of the kind of competencies and higher-\norder thinking skills that would support and be supported by an ICT-based curriculum. To \ndevelop syllabi within an ICT-based curriculum requires practical experience, of which little \nexists. The national testing and assessment system will need to be adjusted accordingly, and \ngreater flexibility in the system may be needed to allow for a gradual and variable approach to \nICT provision in schools.  \n \n6.  Implementation of an ICT-based curriculum requires development of appropriate content \nsoftware and other information resources. This market is poorly developed, with most of what is \navailable in English and Russian. In particular, targeted training and reorientation of authors \ntoward new approaches and requirements will be needed. Sustained capacity building in this \nregard will help ensure that new learning materials will provide the motivation, ideas, support, \nand guidance needed by students and teachers in applying ICT in schools.  \n \n7.  Capacity Building for Teachers, Management, and Technical Support. Success in \nintegrating ICT depends critically on sufficient teachers\u2019 capacity, management, and technical \nsupport, backed by an appropriate incentive system. The Government\u2019s training plan will be \ninsufficient to support the introduction of ICT into educational institutions in the 9,727 schools by \n2010  (footnote  2).  Experience  elsewhere  shows  that  school  principals  and  education \nmanagement in general must strongly support the introduction of ICT in schools, as it will bring \nabout fundamental changes to the education process, management, and administration. For this \npurpose, management training (at central, oblast, raion, and school levels) in ICT skills and \napplications, new pedagogical approaches, school planning, financial and budget management, \nand community relationships are needed. Adequate technical support will be necessary to \nensure  effective  use  of  ICT  facilities.  Mechanisms  for  effective  public  and  private  sector \npartnership should be explored for effective technical support for schools within raion and oblast \nnetworks.  \n \n8.  The proposed training is necessary but not sufficient. For successful integration of ICT, a \nsystem must be in place to provide appropriate incentives for all to adopt, adapt, and change to \nbring progress in learning and teaching through ICT. The Government has recently piloted a \nnationwide system linking teachers\u2019 salaries to performance. This process should be enhanced \nto  address  teachers\u2019  performance  and  career  development-related  issues  linked  with  the \ncomprehensive introduction of ICT.  \n \n9.  Infrastructure Bottlenecks and Hardware Provision. About 35\u201340% of the schools do \nnot have telephone lines; this and other infrastructure bottlenecks need to be addressed in \n ", "  3\ndeveloping Internet access and usage. In equipping schools with ICT, careful consideration will \nneed to be given to (i) appropriate technology\u2014top-of-line computer equipment may not be \nrequired  everywhere,  and  Internet  access  may  not  be  necessary  at  the  initial  stage;  (ii) \nalternative technology\u2014audio-video and DVD instead of, or complementary to, computers; and \n(iii) provision of adequate technical backup and support. \n \n10.  Achieving  Financial  Sustainability  and  Pro-Poor  Issues.  ICT  is  expensive,  and \nsustainability  will  be  a  key  challenge.  Although  the  Government  has  allocated  significant \nresources  for  purchasing  computers  for  schools  in  2005-2009  (mainly  through  the  School \nDevelopment  Fund,  established  in  June  2004),  how  the  significant  recurrent  and  capital \nreplacement costs will be financed is unclear. To ensure sustainability, the Government will \nneed to (i) set realistic and reachable objectives, and (ii) make hard budgetary choices among \ncompeting demands. Cost reduction and recovery strategies and mechanisms may also be \nneeded, including building public and private sector partnerships. The Government has put in \nplace a number of incentives and pro-poor policies since last year, including exemption from \nvalue-added tax and a 50% reduction of user charges for ICT firms operating in rural areas. \nHowever, a comprehensive approach is needed. It will be important to ensure that (i) effective \nmechanisms are in place to protect the poor, particularly if any cost recovery and reduction \nscheme is to be implemented; and (ii) any ICT implementation plan will not enlarge but narrow \nthe internal digital divide between high- and low-income groups. An initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n11.   Support by ADB and other Development Partners. ADB support for basic education \nin Uzbekistan has focused on improving the quality and relevance through investments and \npolicy and institutional reforms. The project will represent an important step in this partnership \nand is consistent with ADB\u2019s education sector strategy and ICT development strategy. The \nproject will benefit from ADB\u2019s experience and lessons learned in ICT development in its other \nmember countries. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) helped the Government \nprepare the national ICT development strategy. An ongoing project supported by the United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  also  has  ICT  development  as  a \ncomponent. The TA will coordinate closely with these development partners.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The overall goal of the project is to improve the quality and relevance of basic education \nthrough the integration of ICT. The purpose of the project is to support the introduction of an \nICT-based approach to teaching and learning in a defined number of grade levels and subjects \nin basic education.  \n \n13.  The TA will help the Government prepare an investment project for integrating ICT into \nbasic education based on a well-formulated ICT development strategy for basic education. \nOutputs of the TA will include (i) an ICT development strategy in basic education and (ii) a \nfeasibility study for a project to integrate ICT in basic education suitable for ADB financing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will follow a participatory approach to build consensus on key challenges facing \nICT development in basic education among key government agencies, and other stakeholders, \nincluding students, parents, teachers, school managers, development partners, and the private \n ", "4  \nsector. A main focus of the TA will be the development of targeted policies and mechanisms to \nhelp bridge the internal digital divide. The TA will explore alternatives and mechanisms to \npromote public and private sector partnership in ICT development.  \n \n15.  The TA will comprise two streams of activities: the first focusing on developing an ICT \nstrategy for basic education, and the second on preparing the feasibility study for the ICT in \nBasic Education Project. The ICT strategy developed will guide nationwide implementation of \nICT integration in basic education over the medium and long term, and will serve as the anchor \nfor the feasibility study. The first stream will begin in March 2005 and a detailed concept \nstrategy is expected by April 2005. A draft strategy is expected to be ready by June 2005 for \nformal discussion with the Government. Further refinement of and consultation on strategy \ndevelopment will take place at a national conference planned for the fourth quarter of 2005, to \nfinalize the strategy. Activities of the first stream will focus on (i) conducting a sector analysis; (ii) \nestablishing  medium-  and  long-term  objectives  of  integrating  ICT  in  basic  education  with \nappropriate indicators; (iii) assessing educational policy, institutional, and capacity needs; (iv) \ndetailing resource needs within a medium-term budgetary framework with costed alternative \nfinancing options for achieving affordability and financial sustainability; and (v) developing model \nhardware and facilities profiles in accordance with the medium- and long-term objectives.  \n \n16.  The second stream\u2014preparation of a project feasibility study\u2014will begin in April 2005, \nanchored in the concept strategy developed under the first stream. A midterm report of the \nfeasibility study will be developed by May 2005, and the draft final report prepared for a tripartite \nmeeting on the feasibility study in mid-June 2005. Activities in the second stream will focus on \n(i) detailed economic and financial analysis of ICT integration; (ii) ICT demand and alternative \nproject analysis, cost and benefit analysis, and budget impact analysis; (iii) poverty and social \nassessment;  (iv)  financial  management  assessment;  and  (v)  developing  detailed  project \ncomponent  plans,  including  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing  arrangements,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  and  schedules.  The  feasibility  study  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for a report and recommendation of the President.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total TA cost is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising $486,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $264,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will cover the entire \nforeign exchange costs and $114,000 equivalent of the local currency costs for a total of \n$600,000.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  contribution,  estimated  at  $150,000  equivalent,  will  be  in  kind  and  cover \nremuneration of counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support, and logistics. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will require 43 person-months of consulting services (17 international and 26 \ndomestic). The international consultants will have expertise in (i) developing ICT strategy in \nbasic education; (ii) integrating ICT in learning and teaching, including curriculum and content \ndevelopment, and capacity building (teaching and management); (iii) institutional development \nand financial sustainability; (iv) hardware and support; (v) social and poverty analysis; and (vi) \neconomic  and  financial  analysis.  ADB  will  engage  a  firm  of  international  consultants  in \nassociation with domestic consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Short-listed firms will be required to prepare simplified technical proposals and will \n ", "  5\nbe selected using quality- and cost-based selection procedures. Outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  The Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) will be the Executing Agency, with the first \ndeputy  minister  as  the  TA  director,  assuming  overall  supervision  responsibility.  MOPE  will \nprovide  adequate  office  space  and  office  furniture,  and  will  cover  the  cost  of  utilities  for \nconsultants and counterpart staff. The TA will make provision for office supplies, workshops, \nadditional support staff, and translation of reports prepared under the TA. The consultants will \ncoordinate  closely  with  other  ongoing  ADB  projects,  particularly  the  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Project and the Second Textbook Development Project.9  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from March 2005 to February 2006. The \nconsultants will submit inception, interim, draft final, and final reports, each containing two \ndistinctive parts (para. 13). In particular, by mid-June 2005, the draft ICT development strategy \nin basic education and the draft feasibility study should be prepared and ready for presentation \nand discussion at a workshop. TA findings will be presented in the interim, midterm, and draft \nfinal workshops, with participation of all stakeholders, tentatively scheduled for March, May, and \nJune 2005, respectively. A conference is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005 to finalize the \nICT development strategy in basic education. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for preparing the Information and Communications Technology \nin Basic Education Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n9  Asian Development Bank. 1997.
