INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia and Asian Development Bank (ADB) agree on the need to \nstrengthen capacity building for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects; as well as the \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, and financing plan of the technical assistance. \nADB will undertake the capacity building program with financial support from the Government of \nthe Republic of Korea. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Mongolian climate has changed significantly over the past 60 years with more than \n80%  of  the  country\u2019s  territory  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  extremes.2 The  mean  annual \ntemperature  increased  by  1.8\u00b0C  between  1940  and  2003.  As  a  result,  the  permafrost  is \ndegrading  intensively  and  high  mountain  glacier  melting  has  increased.3 Precipitation  has \ndecreased by 7.5% in summer and increased by 9.0% in winter. During the last 40 years, the \nduration of heat waves has increased by 8\u201318 days, while cold wave duration has shortened by \n13.3 days. The rate of future winter warming is expected to vary from 0.9\u00b0C to 8.7\u00b0C (depending \non the area of the country), while the summer temperature is expected to vary from 1.3\u00b0C to \n8.6\u00b0C. Winter precipitation is projected to increase between 12.6% and 19.4%, and summer \nrainfall is expected to change by between \u20132.5% to +11.3%. \n \n3.  A northward shift of agricultural zones is likely a result of climate change, such that the \ndry steppe zone in the eastern part of Mongolia would encroach upon the forest steppe to the \nnorth, leading to a shrinkage of the high mountainous and forest steppe zones, and expansion \nof the dry steppe and desert steppe zones. These combined with overgrazing, a 17% decline in \nspring precipitation, and a rise in surface temperature, will likely lead to an increase in frequency \nand extent of forest and steppe fires in Mongolia, resulting in a decline of forest cover.4 \n \n4.  Other climate change issues faced by Mongolia include acceleration of desertification \ndue to a significant decline in forest cover, increase in flash floods caused by erratic rainfall, \nadverse effects on agriculture due to drought and dzud (a layer of frozen rain over vegetation), \ndecreasing groundwater table in arid regions, intensification of degradation and desertification of \nland due to shortage of water and precipitation (footnote 3), and increase in incidence of yellow \nsand posing a serious transboundary threat.  \n \n5.  Combating climate change is a critical development challenge for Mongolia. Mongolia \nsigned the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 12 June 1992 and \nratified  the Kyoto  Protocol  on  15 December  1999.  A  National  Committee  on Climate  was \nestablished in 2000, which includes working groups on public\u2013private partnerships, CDM, and \nenergy efficiency.5 Since ratification, Mongolia has been working to implement CDM and is \nundertaking various initiatives to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions.  However,  the  development  of  CDM  projects  requires  institutional  and  human \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 September 2009. \n2  ADB.

At present, capacity in Mongolia to undertake CDM \nprojects is limited,6 mainly due to lack of national expertise. Financial barriers to adopting \ncleaner technologies in Mongolia lead to inefficiencies in industrial processes, especially for the \nprivate sector. The TA aims to enhance capacity through training for relevant government \nofficials and national experts on the CDM project cycle and development of project design \ndocuments (PDDs). \n \n6.  The long-term strategic framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020 (Strategy \n2020) focuses on addressing climate change as part of the broader agenda of environmentally \nsustainable growth in developing member countries.7 One of the envisaged interventions is \nassistance  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  by  implementing  energy  efficiency  improvement  and \nrenewable energy projects, and suggesting concrete policy recommendations leading to the \nadoption of a low carbon society. Furthermore, energy and environmental issues are identified \nas priority themes and sectors under the ADB\u2013Mongolia country partnership strategy (2010\u2013\n2013) currently being prepared.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The TA aims to enhance capacity and expertise in Mongolia to identify, develop, and \nundertake  CDM  projects.  This  will  be  achieved  by  developing  a  capacity  building  plan, \nenhancing the capacity of national CDM experts and government agencies, and undertaking \npromotional activities encouraging CDM projects. The initiatives being undertaken by Mongolia \nand those undertaken as a consequence of capacity building under the TA are expected to \ncontribute to reducing GHG emissions in the long term. The CDM projects initiated are expected \nto also lead to greater efficiency in energy use in the country.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA\u2019s impact is to reduce GHG emissions in Mongolia. The main outcome is to \nenhance the capacity of relevant stakeholders to undertake CDM projects, as currently the \ncountry has limited expertise in CDM.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  comprises  two  sets  of  outputs.  The  first  consists  of  CDM  project  capacity \nbuilding programs, the second is an assessment of potential for CDM projects and related \nimplementation strategies in Mongolia.   \n \n10.  CDM Capacity Building Program. The program will involve three steps: \n \n(i)  Develop courses. Develop a capacity building plan; identify and assess training \nneeds; define the target audience and participants, training schedule, and time \nline;  select  trainers  among  national  experts  with  inputs  from  the  local  CDM \nagency;  collect  and  analyze  cases  from  other  countries;  develop  a  training \nmanual for national CDM experts and government officials; and prepare brief \nintroductory materials on CDM.  \n                                                 \n6 Begzsuren, M. 2009.

Use  national  and  international  CDM \nexperts  to  improve  understanding  of  CDM  projects  and  benefits  for  project \npartners, outline the benefits of CDM projects and the reason for CDM project \npromotion,  introduce  CDM  project  cases,  and  explain  the  CDM  project \nimplementation process. Conduct two different trainings: a general CDM training \nfor government officials and national experts on the CDM project cycle, including \npresentation of CDM case studies specifically related to efficient energy use and \nafforestation, carbon market, evaluating the financial capacity of national CDM \nand  awareness-raising  efforts,  international  development  aid  activities  and \nenhancing  CDM  investment;  and  technical  training  for  national  experts  on \ndevelopment of PDDs. \n \n(iii)  Enhance CDM material and knowledge sharing. Propose technical guidelines \nfor effective CDM project implementation by developing regulation, legislation, \nand financial and technical guidelines; update CDM guidelines; translate course \nmaterial; include best practice examples of CDM implementation; and develop \nmaterials on CDM for wider dissemination and knowledge sharing. \n \n11.  Assessment of Potential for CDM Projects and Related Implementation Strategies. \nThe assessment of the scope for CDM implementation in Mongolia will be conducted in \ntwo steps: \n \n(i)  Assess the current operating capacity for CDM project development. This \nincludes data collection and analysis on climate change; formulation of a work \nplan to conduct the analysis; study of the capacity of the Designated National \nAuthority on Climate Change and its operating guidelines, human resources, and \nrole in Mongolia; consultations with Mongolian government stakeholders on CDM \nproject  implementation  by  assessing  CDM  projects  and  identifying  potential \nprojects; proposed timeline for CDM project implementation and establishment of \na  national  expert  pool  for  CDM  projects;  conduct  of  feasibility  studies  for \nimplementing CDM pilot projects by reviewing existing CDM feasibility studies \nand relevant literature, and conduct of cost-benefit analysis for potential CDM \nprojects; and finalization of potential CDM projects. \n \n(ii)  Develop an implementation strategy. Following the assessment of potential \nCDM  projects  and  their  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  discuss  the  implementation  of \nCDM projects. After identification and prioritization of possible CDM projects, \ndevelop PDDs for possible CDM projects as outputs of the capacity building \nprogram.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $500,000 equivalent. The Government of \nMongolia has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered \nby ADB. Appendix 2 provides details of the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for this TA. Within ADB, the TA is expected to be \nimplemented by the East Asia Department. A study team, comprising national CDM experts \n ", "4   \nfrom Mongolia and international consultants, will be formed to carry out the TA activities. The \nconsultants will submit inception, interim, and final reports to ADB as scheduled in the design \nand monitoring framework. \n \n14.  The TA will require 19 person-months of individual international and 16 person-months \nof individual national consulting services. ADB will engage all the consultants in accordance with \nthe  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \nline with Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  The TA is expected to be implemented over 7 months from October 2009 to April 2010. \nThe TA results will be disseminated by producing a CD-ROM and training manual on CDM for \nwider dissemination. The TA reports will be uploaded on the ADB website. The TA outcome will \nbe evaluated based on the number of national experts and government officials trained and the \nnumber of new CDM projects developed in the country. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to Mongolia to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for \nthe Capacity Building Program on Clean Development Mechanism, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nReduced greenhouse gas  Greenhouse gas  National policies on  Climate change will continue \nemissions in Mongolia   emission levels lowered  climate change and CDM  and impact environment and \nby 2020  communities \nOutcome      Risks \n       \nEnhanced capacity of  Two PDD prepared and  CDM Designated  CDM projects could be delayed \nstakeholders to undertake  CDM projects  National Authority (DNA)  due to existing complicated \nCDM projects  implemented by April  of Mongolia    project implementation \n  2011    procedures  \n     \n    Lack of capacity to implement \nCDM projects in the short term \n \nOutputs      Risks \n       \n1.
