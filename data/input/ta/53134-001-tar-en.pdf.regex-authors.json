INTRODUCTION\n1. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will carry out cross-sectoral and\nthematic regional studies on the widening \u201cprotection gap\u201d (the gap between the amount of\ninsurance and/or pension coverage that is economically beneficial and what is purchased), and\nhow the development of insurance and pension markets in developing member countries (DMCs)\nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) can help in closing this gap. The focus will be on creating\nan enabling environment for structuring innovative risk financing solutions to help meet emerging\nchallenges in the face of growing inequality, demographic change, and increasing climate change\nand disaster-risk exposures. Cross-country comparisons will help identify areas where insurance\ncan  help  catalyze  long-term  funding,  expand  financial  inclusion,  improve  the  reliability  of\nretirement income for the disabled and the elderly, and increase financial resilience.\n2. The TA is included in the ADB Management-approved 2019 results-based work plan of\nthe Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC).1 It aims to address the\nfollowing operational priority areas as outlined in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining\npoverty and reducing inequalities by strengthening social protection; (ii) accelerating progress in\ngender  equality  by  recommending  insurance  and  pensions  products  targeting  women  and\nbusinesses owned by women; (iii) promoting rural development and food security, including agro-\nbusinesses and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), and tackling the adverse\neffects  of  climate  change  and  natural  hazards  through  innovative  insurance  solutions;  (iv)\nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity to further develop the insurance markets by\nensuring  the  observance  of  international  financial  standards;  and  (v)  fostering  regional\ncooperation and integration by promoting regional risk financing initiatives.2\nII. ISSUES\n3. Insufficient access to risk transfer and risk-sharing solutions. Insurance is well-\nrecognized in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a financial tool\nthat  needs  to  be  actively  used to  attain  the  agreed  outcomes  outlined  in the  Sustainable\nDevelopment  Goals,3 the  Paris  Agreement,  and  the  Sendai  Framework  for  Disaster  Risk\nReduction. Comprehensive risk management includes the integration of insurance and pension\ninstruments for sustainable development, and the private insurance and pension markets can play\na critical role in supporting the real economy by delivering risk financing and protection solutions.\nThe insurance and pension industry will serve an increasingly critical role in protecting households\nand businesses against a widening range of risks, heightening the importance of observing the\nprinciples and standards of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.\n4. Insufficient risk resilience by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; farmers;\nand households. The assets, lives, and incomes of MSMEs, farmers, and households are\ndisproportionately exposed to natural hazards and man-made perils, which are increasing in\nfrequency and severity, and in addition further exacerbated by climate change. These disasters\nresult in financial losses and loss of livelihoods with devastating impact on development. In\nemerging Asia, the insurance protection gap exceeds 90% for three major perils\u2014storms, floods\nand earthquakes\u2014which can have a significant economic burden through loss and damage to\ninfrastructure and property, and loss of income and livelihoods. Insurance and mutual insurance\n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 October 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  United Nations. 2015. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. New York.  ", "2 \ncan offer financial, operational, and information benefits to the insured population, such as \nguaranteed access to funds up to agreed limits, planning certainty through the payment of \npremiums, no payback obligation as opposed to lending-based solutions, fast payout under \nparametric schemes, and improved economic efficiency of resource allocation as a result of \npricing of risks through insurance. \n5. Widening pension gap results in reduced retirement living standards. Pensions are\ngenerally viewed as a type of social insurance provided through a public mechanism, because\nprivate pensions are very limited in many countries. Changes in the old-age dependency ratio\n(which measures the number of elderly people as a share of those of working age) challenges\nmost public pension systems in Asia and the Pacific. With available pension fund assets becoming\ninsufficient to meet the obligations promised to current and future retirees, governments and\nemployers are increasingly shifting longevity and market or savings risks to individuals, e.g.,\nthrough  reduced  public  pension  schemes  and  transition  from  defined-benefit  to  defined-\ncontribution schemes  in  retirement  plans.  This  trend  is  further  increasing  gaps  in  pension\nprotection and can impose a severe additional financial burden on society and will most likely\nincrease the number of individuals who outlive their assets and are at risk of falling into poverty.\nPublicly mandated pension schemes need to be complemented with occupational and individual\nvoluntary pension schemes to ensure future retirement income is adequate, particularly for the\ninformal sector and people with disabilities. Some pension schemes are privately managed by\ninsurance companies, which assume the longevity risks from individuals who seek steady, reliable\nretirement income.\n6. Innovative solutions to reduce the protection gap. When considering innovative ways\nto increase insurance and pension coverage governments, communities, and financial institutions\n(including banking, securities, and insurance institutions) all have a role to play in creating\nsufficiently large risk communities. Governments can assist by providing an enabling policy and\nregulatory environment; introducing compulsory insurance schemes to increase take-up rates by\nforming the widest possible risk community, and eliminating adverse selection; or encouraging\nthe establishment of intra-community support mechanisms\u2014such as cooperatives, mutual and\ninsurance pools for MSMEs, farmers, and grassroots organizations\u2014to mitigate the economic\nimpact of shocks. Increased protection for the population at risk can be provided by combining\nelements of risk retention in the form of household savings, risk-sharing by way of developing\ncommunity reserves with contributions from households, and risk transfer via insurance. Digital\nand mobile distribution and the use of new technology can leapfrog access to insurance in\ncountries with few insurance intermediaries and poorly developed distribution frameworks.\n7. The TA will draw on lessons from previous TA projects on insurance, which include the\nimportance  of  (i) developing  cross-sectoral  and  thematic  synergies  (e.g.,  social  protection,\nagriculture,  and  rural  development)  to  support  the  expansion  of  ADB\u2019s  insurance  market\noperations; (ii) engaging in dialogue with DMCs to promote market-led innovative insurance\nproducts and schemes; and (iii) developing an enabling policy and regulatory landscape in which\ninsurance  can  scale.4 Insurance  supervisors  play  a  critical  role  in  creating  the  enabling\nenvironment that incentivizes insurers to design innovative products and schemes. The TA will\nleverage existing partnerships with international standard-setting bodies (SSBs) to ensure that\n4  ADB. 2012.

Manila. ", "3 \nthe development of the insurance markets align with international financial standards.5 The TA \nwill look into existing risk-financing arrangements under consideration, such as those under the \nAsia\u2013Pacific  Climate  Finance  Fund,6 and  support  the  development  and  implementation  of \npipeline projects for ADB\u2019s operations departments. \nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n8. The TA is aligned with the following impact: enabling environment for incentivizing the\nparticipation of insurers and reinsurers improved (footnote 2). The TA will have the following\noutcome: innovative insurance solutions expanded.7\nB. Outputs, Methods, and Activities\n9. Output 1: Analytical studies on insurance and pensions solutions delivered. The TA\nwill produce at least three regional analytical studies on (i) insurance solutions that can make\naccess to finance more efficient for businesses owned by women and MSMEs (e.g., linking credit\nwith insurance; and providing complete financial protection, such as crop insurance to mitigate\nfarmers\u2019 risks, portfolio insurance, and regional risk-sharing arrangements);8 (ii) risk financing\ninstruments that can make funding more effective by linking funding to results and by using\ntechnology (e.g., to enable forecast-based insurance, parametric insurance, and microinsurance\nto support high-impact government programs); and (iii) individually funded and privately managed\npension products and schemes for the disabled, elderly and women, that take into consideration\nthe impact of both the corporate and personal income tax regimes, to ensure adequate, steady\nand reliable retirement incomes (e.g., through occupational and individual voluntary pensions,\nand reverse mortgages). The country selection process for output 1 will (i) target DMCs interested\nin carrying out reforms by involving the private sector to bridge the protection gap; and (ii) consider\nDMCs\u2019 gross national income, insurance penetration, regulatory frameworks, general readiness,\npossible impacts, and the state of technological infrastructure to enable savings.9 The regional\nanalytical studies will also look at experience in countries outside Asia and the Pacific, with results\npublished online and disseminated in regional seminars.\n10. Output 2: Use of new technology for developing innovative insurance solutions\ndemonstrated. The TA will pilot one project in a DMC where there is an ongoing finance sector\nproject.10 It will involve the use of innovative technology for faster processing of loan applications\nand disbursement of loans, e.g., leveraging financial technology to help banks and insurers better\nassess risk and link insurance with credit to improve access to finance for MSMEs and agro-\nbusinesses. A feasibility study that includes a comprehensive analysis of the rural and agriculture\ncredit and insurance ecosystem will inform the design of the pilot. The study will assist ADB\u2019s\noperations departments to demonstrate that impact and policy recommendations from the pilot\n5  ADB is a member of the following SSBs: the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the International \nOrganisation of Securities Commission, and the Islamic Financial Serviced Board. \n6  The Asia\u2013Pacific Climate Finance Fund is a multi-donor trust fund established in April 2017 with the objective of \nsupporting the development and implementation of financial risk management products that can help unlock capital \nfor climate investments and improve resilience to the impacts of climate change. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n8  Risk pooling to provide capacity to licensed mutual insurers in Asian countries to enhance community-based \ninsurance and access to finance for MSMEs and agro-business. \n9  Countries proposed to be included are Bangladesh, Fiji, Pakistan, and Philippines subject to the approval by the \ngovernment.   \n10 The pilot project will potentially be undertaken in the Philippines. ", "4 \nwill help in identifying opportunities for expansion and replication in an enabling legal and \nregulatory environment. The pilot will provide opportunities to develop an operations project \npipeline through investments in insurance and reinsurance vehicles and new technology. Briefs, \ninterviews,  and  video  blogs  will  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  ADB\u2019s  Department  of \nCommunications to capture and showcase the impact of the pilot project, including any lessons. \n11. Output 3: Capacity of national and regional policymakers, insurance supervisors,\nand other insurance industry stakeholders improved. The results of the analytical studies and\npilot project will be used to (i) provide an overview of the depth and breadth of the insurance and\ncapital markets, including the presence of pension funds and mutual funds; and (ii) make\nrecommendations regarding financial instruments and schemes (including alternative risk transfer\nand risk sharing) for replication and expansion. Savings and the purchase of insurance will be\nencouraged through the development of an enabling environment by means of knowledge support\nand  capacity-building  events  for  policymakers,  financial  market  supervisors,  and  insurance\nindustry stakeholders in collaboration with international (re)insurers and international financial\nSSBs, which will serve to strengthen institutional capacity, including by promoting understanding\nof financial products for target markets.\nC. Cost and Financing\n12. The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant\nbasis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund (FSDPSF),11 and (ii)\n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge\nPartnership Fund (EAKPF) and administered by ADB.
