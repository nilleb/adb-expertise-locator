INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been assisting the Government of India to \ndevelop public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) to meet the country\u2019s large infrastructure needs. \nThe assistance is through a joint government\u2013ADB initiative1 in PPP mainstreaming and pilot \nproject development. In response to increasing demand to widen the initiative's coverage and \nscope, the Government has requested additional ADB support through this technical assistance \n(TA).  \n \n2.  Fact-finding  missions  were  conducted  in  October  2009.  The  Government  and  ADB \nagreed on the objective, scope, implementation arrangements, and financing plan for the TA.2 \nThe TA is in line with (i) India's Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012),3 (ii) ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) for deepening private sector development,4 and \n(iii) ADB's country operations business plan 2008\u20132010.5 The agreed design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  PPP  rationale.  Infrastructure  development  is  a  key  government  strategy  for \nsustaining the country's positive annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth, measured at \n8.6% from 2004 to 2008.6 However, there is a large infrastructure funding need. To address the \nsizeable infrastructure gaps across the country, the government is pursuing a strategy to enable \nPPPs  to  attract  private  investment  while  leveraging  their  operation  efficiencies  to  improve \nservice standards.  \n \n4.  The government\u2013ADB PPP initiative. In a joint initiative commenced in 2007, ADB has \nprovided comprehensive support to the government in building the PPP-enabling environment. \nThe initiative includes institutionalization of policies and processes, capacity building, sector-\nspecific strategies and toolkits, and pilot project development. The initiative has led to (i) the \nsuccessful establishment and operation of 25 PPP cells at state governments and central line \nministries; (ii) capacity building of relevant government staff to prepare, evaluate, appraise, and \nimplement PPP projects; (iii) the development of information systems and PPP databases; (iv) \nthe standardization of, and support to, project risk appraisal processes; (v) the development of \npilot  projects  in  challenging  sectors;  (vi)  support  for  the  viability  gap  fund  and  project \ndevelopment funds; and (vii) the development of sector-specific toolkits.  \n \n5.  Evolving  challenges.  The  positive  outcomes  from  earlier  TA  projects  are  well \nrecognized across the country. With the emergence of PPP project pipelines, the government \nwishes to expand the current coverage and scope of PPP mainstreaming efforts to cover \nadditional states,7 namely Bihar, Delhi, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Sikkim, \n                                                 \n1  The initiative comprises four TA projects: ADB. 2006.

Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2008-2010. Manila. \n6  The Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012) requires increased government spending on infrastructure from 4.6% to \n8.0% of GDP to accelerate average GDP growth from 7% to the targeted 9%. \n7  The actual selection of the states could vary during TA implementation. \n ", "2       \nMizoram, and West Bengal, and including relevant urban local bodies (ULBs) and line ministries \nand  sector  departments.  The  objective  is  to  eventually  develop  a  PPP  project  pipeline, \nparticularly in small municipalities that generally have limited economies of scale, or in the \nchallenging sectors of water supply and sanitation, health, education, power distribution, and \nrural development.  \n \n6.  A key lesson from the ongoing initiative is the difficulty in developing self-sustaining, \nbankable PPP projects. For example, because of the political sensitivity in tariff setting, certain \nwater PPP projects deter private operators from taking on greater revenue risk. These projects \nare often structured through a management contract or annuity-type structure, with limited \ncapital  investment  from  private  operators.  The  lack  of  adequate  capacity  and  enabling \nenvironment also causes the government to utilize grants and internally generated resources to \nfund  the  capital  and  operating  costs  without  leveraging  other  private  capital.  Therefore, \nimproving the PPP enabling environment through policy and regulatory reform is crucial to \nincrease private sector confidence in making sizable investments and help the government \nstructure PPP infrastructure projects on a sustainable basis.  \n \n7.  Addressing the challenges. The TA will strengthen the capacity of government staff in \nthe states not yet covered by ongoing ADB assistance (footnote 1).8 The capacity will be built \nupon designated state PPP nodal officers at state PPP cells and a team of PPP specialists at \nstate, ULB, and relevant line ministry and sector department levels. Over a 2\u20133 year period, \ncertain  staff  with  appropriate  PPP  skill  sets  is  intended  to  be  designated  with  specific \nresponsibility  of  PPP  development.  Clarifications  of  these  positions  and  related  human \nresources strategy to retain these talents will be included in the future ADB dialogue with the \ngovernment and is intended to be incorporated in the relevant future ADB assistance. \n \n8.  The enhanced capacity will help improve the provision of infrastructure and service \ndelivery in target states. Consultants will be recruited through a pooled PPP cell within the \ncentral government to support these additional states. Bankable projects will be developed with \na  focus  on  challenging  sectors.  They  will  serve  as  replicable  models  capable  of  blending \ncommercial  lending,  private  sector  investment,  and  government  funds.  This  TA  will  also \nexamine the policy and regulatory framework and address the lifecycle costs of operating and \nmaintaining  utilities,  whether  through  user  fees  and/or  tariffs  or  shadow-tariff  structures. \nAltogether, these efforts should create an enabling PPP environment in the additional states \nand a PPP project pipeline on a bankable and sustainable basis.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved provision of infrastructure and delivery of service \nin additional states (at state, ULB, line ministry, and sector department levels). The outcome of \nthe TA will be improved public sector capacity to develop, implement, and monitor infrastructure \nPPP projects. \n \n                                                 \n8  In terms of ADB's overall PPP assistance (initiative) road map in India, this TA is an extension of the three ADB TA \nprojects in PPP mainstreaming (footnote 1), by targeting additional state government entities. During the capacity \nbuilding process, this TA also complements ongoing ADB TA in PPP pilot project development and proposed ADB \nTA in national PPP policy formulation through more detailed scoping of relevant project potentials and policy and \nregulatory issues at state and sector and subsector levels. \n ", "      3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  activities  will  support  the  government  in  developing  an  enabling  PPP \nenvironment and building a bankable PPP project pipeline through the following three capacity \nbuilding components.  \n \n11.  Component 1: Deepening PPP capacity building in additional state government \nentities. A pool of PPP consultants will be recruited to form an enhanced PPP cell at the \nDepartment of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, to provide capacity building at \nadditional states, ULBs, line ministries/sector departments, and other government entities. The \ntarget group is selected government staff tasked with PPP development activities, led by the \nrespective state PPP nodal officers. Sustainability is built upon the capacity building process to \nclarify and institutionalize the PPP function in the government entities. The cell will perform \nselected  tasks  of  (i)  training  government  staff  on  PPP  processes  and  methodologies;  (ii) \nassisting in developing PPP-enabling policies and regulations; (iii) supporting development, \nappraisal, and implementation of PPP projects; (iv) conducting awareness building of domestic \nand international best practices; and (v) developing monitoring mechanisms and parameters for \nPPP projects.  \n \n12.  Component  2:  Development  of  bankable  PPP  project  structures.  PPP  projects \nsometimes are not bankable on commercial terms. Various government supports are required. \nThis  is  obvious  in  the  challenging  infrastructure  sectors  because  cost  recovery  is  difficult. \nThrough the development of bankable PPP project structures and concepts, government can \ncreate project sustainability, in which (i) financing options are optimized to blend private equity, \ncommercial debt, concessional funds, and government grant funds;9 (ii) sound financial models \nare developed; (iii) other technical and commercial aspects are considered; and (iv) financial \nclosure is achieved through negotiations and agreements with the identified investors. This \ncomponent will align with the existing ADB PPP pilot project TA (footnote 1). \n \n13.  Component  3:  Development  of  PPP  enabling  toolkits.  This component supports \ncapacity building of additional government entities through PPP-enabling toolkits, documents, \nand knowledge-sharing activities. It includes (i) development of sectorwide policy and regulatory \nassessments and proposed policy frameworks at state and sector and subsector levels,10 (ii) \ndevelopment of good governance institutional structures for sector vehicles such as a proposed \ncorporatized entity structure for utilities, and (iii) communications strategy and framework for \nPPP projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million equivalent, of which ADB will finance $800,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from the ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014other \nsources). The Government will provide $200,000 equivalent to finance local currency costs to \ncover counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, facilitation for meetings, and \nother expenses. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n9  Such as the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund. \n10 This supports the proposed TA for developing a national PPP policy.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  DEA  will  be  the  TA  executing  agency.  TA  implementation  will  be coordinated  in  a \ncoherent manner with the joint government\u2013ADB initiative, allowing for integration of all PPP \nactivities without duplication of efforts. DEA and ADB PPP focal points based in India will \noversee the implementation process. DEA will establish a steering committee, chaired by a joint \nsecretary at DEA, to provide overall guidance and monitor TA activities. Steering committee will \nmeet every 6 months and have representatives from the participating PPP cells. Private sector \nparticipation in the steering committee, such as from potential concessionaires, is encouraged. \n \n16.  Procurement methods for recruiting consultants will be determined according to the \nfollowing three components. A total of 151 person-months of consulting (20 person-months of \ninternational consulting and 131 person-months of national consulting) is envisaged to provide \nthe TA inputs. A consulting firm or consortium could be selected to provide 70 person-months of \nconsulting  under  component  2.  All  procurement  for  individuals  and  a  consulting  firm  or \nconsortium will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (January 2008).11 \n \n17.  Under  component  1.  A  pool  of  up  to  four  individual  PPP  consultants  (national \nconsultants) with experience in PPP financial structuring will be recruited for the enhanced PPP \ncell in DEA. The consultants will be recruited for 12\u201318 months each for a total of 45 person-\nmonths.  \n \n18.  Under component 2. Either a consulting firm or consortium or a pool of at least five \nindividual consultants will be recruited with backgrounds in (i) financial structuring and modeling, \n(ii) relevant technical engineering, (iii) legal and regulatory advisory, (iv) social safeguards, and \n(v) environmental safeguards (as appropriate). The requirement for flexibility in the recruitment \nmethod is due to the tight market conditions in India for experienced PPP specialists. The \nconsulting firm or consortium will be selected based on quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) \nmethod with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The firm or consortium will be selected under a full \ntechnical proposal.  \n \n19.  Under  component  3.  An  individual  PPP  policy  and  regulatory  consultant  will  be \nrecruited for a total of 12 person-months to develop (i) sectorwide regulatory assessments and \nproposed  policy  frameworks,  (ii)  good  governance  institutional  structures,  and  (iii)  a \ncommunications strategy and framework for PPP projects.  \n \n20.  In addition, a separate, individual TA project management consultant will be engaged for \n24 person-months to coordinate all activities. \n \n21.  DEA will provide office space, logistics, and administrative support for establishing the \npool of consultants. The TA will be implemented from February 2010 to February 2012. Project \nresults and evaluation reports will be disseminated by the steering committee and made publicly \navailable on the appropriate website. The advance payment facility, to be administered and \nmanaged by DEA, may continue to be used to facilitate TA disbursement.  \n \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008.
