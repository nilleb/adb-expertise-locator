INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of India regards the generation of productive and gainful employment \nto  absorb  India\u2019s  growing  labor  force  as  being  critical  for  facilitating  inclusive  growth  and \nenhancing the overall productivity of the economy. Therefore, during the country programming \nmission held in May 2011, the government indicated that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nshould  support  the  National  Skill  Development  Corporation  (NSDC)  in  operationalizing  the \nmandate  of  India\u2019s  National  Skills  Policy,  2009.  Accordingly,  this  $1.1  million  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) for \u2015Financing Skills Development\u2016 was included in the \n2011 nonlending program for India.1 Based on subsequent discussions with NSDC, the project \nname was changed to \u2015Skill Development for Inclusive Growth.\u2016 The design and monitoring \nframework (DMF) for the TA is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India\u2019s National Skills Policy, 2009, aims to provide skills to 500 million people by 2022 \nby creating skills systems that have a high degree of inclusiveness in terms of gender, rural \nversus urban, organized versus unorganized, and traditional versus contemporary jobs. The \npolicy emphasizes that skills development initiatives should be dynamic, demand-based, and \nclosely aligned with government policies on economic growth, employment generation, and \nsocial development. A three-tier institutional structure-consisting of (i) the National Council on \nSkill  Development  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister,  (ii)  the  National  Skill  Development \nCoordination Board chaired by the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, and (iii) the \nNSDC-has been set up to fulfill this challenging mandate.  \n \n3.  The capacity of the existing skills development programs has to be raised from 3.1 \nmillion per annum to around 15 million per annum to train the new entrants to the labor market. \nIndia\u2019s skill development initiatives need to address three types of imbalances that have arisen \ndue to the rapid structural changes in its economy over the past decade and a half: (i) a \ngeographic imbalance since the states with the highest population and labor force growth are \nalso the ones lagging in terms of growth and job creation; (ii) a demand\u2212supply imbalance since \nthe work force being created in terms of quality and profile is not aligned with the evolving \ndemand; and (iii) a sectoral mismatch since the current education system is not providing the \nskills  required  by  the  fast-growing  sectors.3 Both  the  quality  and  capacity  of  India\u2019s  skills \ndevelopment programs need significant strengthening. \n \n4.  NSDC has been set up as a public\u2212private partnership (PPP) under Section 25 of the \nCompanies  Act,  1956,  for  catalyzing  skills  development  through  private  entities,  and  to \nsupplement and revitalize government-led vocational training and skills development programs \nthat have been the norm until now. Its mandate is to provide skills to 150 million people by 2022. \nNSDC has a core equity base of $2.2 million of which the Government of India accounts for \n49%  and  the  private  sector  for  the  remaining  51%.  A  tiered  decision-making  structure \ncomprising a board, board sub-committees and an executive council helps NSDC to operate in \na transparent and effective manner. It draws on the National Skill Development Fund, a 100% \ngovernment-owned trust fund run by professional fund managers, to support the following broad \ntypes of activities. First, NSDC encourages private sector investment in profit and nonprofit \nenterprises  in  training  and  skill  development  in  20  high-growth  sectors  and  the  huge \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2012\u22122014. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 December 2011.   \n3  Between 1990 and 2009, the share of the services sector in India\u2019s GDP increased from 44.4% to 54.6%, that of \nindustry increased marginally from 26.7% to 28.2%, while that of agriculture fell from 28.9% to 17.1%. \n ", "2   \nunorganized sector to build capacity in the technical and vocational education and training \n(TVET)  segment.4 NSDC  provides  viability  gap funding through  loans, equity,  or grants.  It \nemploys  a  phased  and  detailed  due-diligence  process  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i) \nemployer view of demand for the specific skills to be provided; (ii) skills gap analysis of the 21 \nsectors covered by NSDC including the unorganized sector; (iii) alignment with NSDC's mission; \n(iv) robustness of the overall plan and operating model; and (iv) ability to leverage partnerships \nand  financial  resources.  Entities  eligible  for  funding  include  industry,  training  and  skill \ndevelopment organizations, nongovernment organizations, business associations, and social \nentrepreneurs. NSDC does not finance land acquisition or the construction of buildings because \nit want to encourage more efficient use of the existing infrastructure, and instead focus on \nimproving training and skills development programs. As of 18 August 2011, NSDC had signed \n39 memorandums of understanding amounting to $225 million for providing skills to 37.74 \nmillion people by 2022.  \n \n5.  Second,  NSDC  is  mandated  by  the  National  Skills  Policy  to  develop  an  enabling \nenvironment for skills development. It has to lay down sector-specific competencies, quality \nassurance and certification standards by facilitating the creation of sector skills councils (SSCs) \nas national partnership organizations involving all relevant stakeholders from industry, labor, \nand academia in the particular sector. The core functions of the SSCs can be grouped under the \nfollowing categories:  \n \n(i)  Research. The SSCs have to identify the current and projected skills gaps in their \nsectors and catalogue the types, range, and depth of skills required. They have to \ndevelop sector-specific skills and competency standards, and benchmark these with \ninternational occupation standards. SSCs would also prepare skills development plans, \nmaintain  a  skills  inventory  database,  and  establish  sector-specific  labor  market \ninformation systems to assist in the planning and delivery of training.  \n \n(ii)  Quality assurance. The SSCs are responsible for standardizing and streamlining the \naffiliation and accreditation process\u2014i.e., certification tests for employees and trainers to \nensure consistency and acceptability of standards. They also have to participate in the \naccreditation and certification of courses specific to or related to their sectors.  \n \n(iii) Delivery. The SSCs will develop and update course modules, and train good quality \ntrainers. They would have to partner with educational institutions to train trainers and \nupgrade skill sets of existing industry employees and those in the industry\u2019s value chain \nincluding dealer and service networks. SSCs are also mandated to promote academies \nof excellence. \n \n6.  NSDC  has  already  approved  eight  SSCs  for  the  following  sectors:  (i)  automobile \nmanufacturing; (ii) private security; (iii) energy; (iv) media, animation, gaming, and films; (v) \ninformation technology and information technology-enabled services; (vi) health care; (vii) retail; \nand (viii) banking and financial services. Proposals for setting up SSCs in other sectors such as \ntransport and logistics, food processing, electronics, handicrafts, and gems and jewelry are \nexpected to be approved by February 2012.  \n \n                                                \n4  Sectors include automobile and auto components, textiles and garments, leather and leather goods, gems and \njewelry, building and construction, food processing, tourism hospitality and travel trade, transport and logistics, \nwarehousing,  packaging,  organized  retail,  health  care,  banking,  insurance,  finance,  education,  and  skills \ndevelopment services.   \n ", "  3 \n7.  Effective operationalization of SSCs and the establishment of suitable linkages with the \nproposed national vocational qualifications framework (NVQF), currently being designed by the \nMinistry of Labor and Employment (MOLE), is critical to ensure that all the skills development \nprograms being supported by NSDC and the various ministries (including MOLE, Ministry of \nRural Development, Ministry of Power, and Ministry of Road Transport and Highways) can be \ncarried on in a harmonized and structured manner. Given the complexity of the tasks that have \nto be carried out by the SSCs, and the fact that they need to bring together and ensure \nsustained  coordination  across  all  relevant  stakeholders  at  the  national  and  state  levels, \nsignificant technical assistance will be required. Since SSCs will lay the foundation on which \nIndia\u2019s skills development initiatives will be built, the importance of rolling them out effectively \ncannot be overemphasized.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s current country partnership strategy (2009\u22122012) focuses on supporting India\u2019s \nefforts towards facilitating inclusive and sustainable growth.5  The country operations business \nplan  for  2012\u22122014  also  highlights  the  importance  of  human  development  including  skills \ndevelopment with a focus on the infrastructure sectors, productive employment generation, and \nenhanced health and social protection outcomes (footnote 1). The TA is therefore fully aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s India program and Strategy 2020, 6 and will prepare the groundwork for future ADB \noperations in the priority area of skill development in India.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will assist NSDC in establishing one SSC each in the service sector (such as \nhealth care) and infrastructure sector (such as transport and logistics or construction). These \nare  priority  areas  with  significant  employment  and  development  potential.  By  2022,  the \nincremental demand for trained and certified workers in the allied health care segment (e.g., \noperation theatre and laboratory technicians, community health workers) is estimated at 12.7 \nmillion, while that in the transport and logistics sector is projected at 17.7 million. By building the \ncapacity of two pilot SSCs, the TA will provide a template for other SSCs, thereby helping \nNSDC in fulfilling a key part of their mandate. The following activities will be carried out under \nthe TA to help make the SSCs operational: (i) identifying focus areas for skills development \nbased on market analysis and stakeholder consultations by the SSCs; (ii) scoping the functions \nof the SSC; (iii) firming up the constitution (membership) and governance system of the SSC; \n(iv) preparing a financial sustainability model and budget estimates for the functioning of the \nSSC;  and  (v)  preparing  support  documentation  and  toolkits  to  assist  in  the  subsequent \nfunctioning of the SSC. \n \n10.  The TA will also support two states (as pilots) in linking their skills development missions \nmore effectively with the new, PPP-driven skill development initiatives being promoted by NSDC \nand other government-run schemes at the national level.7  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be that NSDC\u2019s approach to skills development becomes \nsustainable.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  that  NSDC\u2019s  skills  development  institutional \nframework and operational guidelines are developed for replication across more sectors. By \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u22122012. Manila.  \n6  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u22122020. \nManila.  \n7  The states will be selected in consultation with DEA.  \n ", "4   \nassisting NSDC in making two SSCs operational, the TA will pave the way for the rollout of \nother SSCs in the services and infrastructure sectors. ADB will also help to effectively link the \nskills development missions of two (pilot) states with the skills development initiatives of NSDC \nand the central ministries. The scoping studies and road maps prepared will be useful in guiding \nNSDC in supporting skills development initiatives across states including under the proposed \nADB loan.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will work towards achieving this outcome by supporting the following broad \noutputs: (i) NSDC assisted in establishing two SSCs; (ii) improved linkage between the skills \ndevelopment missions of two (pilot) states with national skills development initiatives; (iii) policy \nmakers  informed  about  best  practices  in  skills  development;  and  (iv)  project  activities \nundertaken in a timely manner and within budget. The formulation of the SSCs will include \ngovernance frameworks laying down social and gender-sensitive occupation standards, quality \nassurance and accreditation procedures, and standards for both trainees and trainers. The TA \nwill delineate appropriate representation of all relevant stakeholders in the SSCs, draft template \nmemorandums of understanding to specify their roles and responsibilities, and finalize a road \nmap with milestones for the rollout. The TA will also focus on creating a sustainable financial \nstructure, staffing requirements, and initial budgets for the functioning of the SSCs. Manuals will \nbe prepared to guide sector functional analysis, train trainers, and prepare quality assurance \nstandards and competency frameworks, LMIS reports, and monitoring and evaluation reports.   \n \n13.  Most states have also set up skills development missions and are increasingly looking \ntowards NSDC for guidance to improve the design and delivery of their own skills programs. \nThe TA will therefore help to prepare scoping studies on the skills development missions of two \nstates (as pilots), elaborating how they can link up effectively with the new, private-sector-driven \nskills development initiatives being promoted by NSDC and various government schemes at the \nnational level. Career guidance and social marketing campaigns will also be undertaken to raise \nawareness about the importance of technical and vocational training, the need to enhance one\u2019s \nskills, and the various initiatives of the government and NSDC.  \n \n14.  Knowledge  products  focusing  on  international  best  practice  in  the  area  of  skills \ndevelopment and sector skills councils will be prepared to enrich the policy dialogue. The \nfindings of these knowledge products will be disseminated through workshops and focus-group \ndiscussions involving key stakeholders including NSDC, the Planning Commission, relevant \nministries, private sector representatives, chambers of commerce, NGOs, and donor partners. \nThis will help to ensure that all stakeholders coordinate well and respond appropriately to the \nnew skills development initiatives being supported by NSDC. Suitable financing options which \ncan sustain skills development for poorer students, especially those living in small cities and \nrural areas, will also be examined.  \n    \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The Government of India has requested ADB to finance $1.1 million equivalent, which \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other \nsources).  The  government  and  counterpart  contributions  will  be  in-kind  and  cover  office \naccommodation, transportation, and counterpart staff salaries, as required. Cost estimates and \nthe financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance will be the executing \nagency for this TA. NSDC will be the implementing agency. A TA steering committee comprising \nrepresentatives from the Department of Economic Affairs, NSDC, and other relevant entities will \nbe  constituted.  It  will  meet  periodically  and  provide  overall  policy  direction,  and  facilitate \ncoordination among concerned government and private agencies.  \n \n17.  A total of 61 person-months of consulting inputs will be provided under the TA: 18 \nperson-months of international and 43 person-months of national consultants. ADB will engage \nthe consultants through a firm (54 person-months), using a simplified proposal for the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method,  as  well  as  on  an  individual  basis  (7  person-months)  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). All TA-financed goods will be procured in line with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nEquipment such as laptops, printers, photocopiers, and other required items procured under the \nTA will be handed over to NSDC upon completion of the project. The advance payment facility \nmay be used for payment of eligible costs. The TA will be implemented over 24 months with \nexpected commencement in January 2012 and completion in January 2014.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,100,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Skills Development for Inclusive Growth, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By end 2016:  For all indicators:   Assumption \n       All public and private \nThe National Skill  (i) Number of candidates  Periodic reports of  stakeholders in the \nDevelopment  trained through private sector  NSDC.   sector skills councils \nCorporation\u2019s  driven skills development    (SSCs) will coordinate \n(NSDC) approach to  initiatives supported by NSDC  Reports of the Planning  and respond well to \nskills development  (with separate numbers for  Commission, Ministry of  the new skills \nbecomes sustainable  women).
