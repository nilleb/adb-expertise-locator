INTRODUCTION \n1.  The finance ministries and central banks of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) have made a commitment to strengthen their financial integration as an essential step \ntowards the realization of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 2015. In particular, they \nplan to liberalize financial services and the capital account, and develop the capital markets. \n \n2.  To  fulfill  the  objective,  the  ASEAN  Central  Bank  Forum  (ACBF)  Task  Force  on \nMilestones  towards  ASEAN  Monetary  and  Financial  Integration  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  their  Combined  Studies on  Assessing  the  Financial \nLandscape and Formulating Milestones for Monetary and Financial Integration in ASEAN. The \ncombined studies aim to assess the current regulations for financial services and set milestones \nto achieve monetary and financial integration in the region. \n \n3.  ADB provided a small-scale research and development technical assistance (TA) to \nsupport the combined studies. As a follow-up to that TA project, ACBF has requested ADB to \nprovide further support to prepare a more detailed implementation plan for the member states. \nThe proposed research and development TA1 will support the combined studies in formulating a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  the  financial  sector  landscape  and  detailed  implementation \nstrategies for ASEAN member countries so that the AEC\u2019s financial integration can be achieved \nby 2015. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  At the Bali Summit in October 2003, the ASEAN leaders declared that the AEC will be \nthe goal of regional economic integration by 2020. Then, at the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu in \nJanuary  2007,  the  ASEAN  leaders  affirmed  their  strong  commitment  to  accelerating  the \nestablishment of the ASEAN Community by 2015. In November 2007, at the 13th ASEAN \nSummit in Singapore, the ASEAN leaders adopted the AEC Blueprint from which each ASEAN \nmember country shall abide by and implement the AEC by 2015. \n \n5.  The AEC aims to establish ASEAN as a single market and production base, thereby \nmaking  ASEAN  more  dynamic  and  competitive.  This  will  entail  (i)  putting  in  place  new \nmechanisms and measures to strengthen the implementation of its existing economic initiatives \nand ensure the free flow of goods, services, and capital; (ii) accelerating regional integration in \npriority sectors; (iii) facilitating the movement of business persons, skilled labor, and talent; and \n(iv) strengthening the institutional mechanisms of ASEAN. \n \n6.  The AEC Blueprint, which provides a comprehensive vision of economic integration with \na strategic schedule, states that, to achieve a free flow of financial services, ASEAN member \ncountries must substantially remove restrictions in the insurance, banking, and capital market \nsubsectors by 2015. For example, direct life insurance needs to be liberalized in Indonesia and \nthe  Philippines;  direct  nonlife  insurance  needs  to  be  liberalized  in  Brunei  Darussalam, \nCambodia,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Singapore,  and  Viet  Nam;  acceptance  of \ndeposits and other repayable funds from the public needs to be liberalized in Cambodia, the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam; trading for one\u2019s own account or for the account \nof customers needs to be liberalized in Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand; and asset management needs to be liberalized in Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, and Thailand. \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 November  2010.  \n ", "2  \n \n7.  To foster the freer flow of capital, the AEC Blueprint states that member countries shall \nact to (i) remove or relax restrictions, where appropriate and possible, to facilitate the flows of \npayments and transfers for current account transactions; and (ii) remove or relax restrictions on \ncapital flows, where appropriate and possible, to support foreign direct investment and initiatives \nto promote capital market development. \n \n8.  To create a strong momentum toward a more liberalized and harmonized environment in \nthe financial service sector, the ASEAN finance ministries have recognized that the region \nneeds a comprehensive study that maps out the current ASEAN financial landscape; analyzes \nvarious gaps, issues, and constraints in the integration of financial markets in ASEAN; and \nprovides a detailed framework and strategy for each country. \n \n9.  The small-scale research and development TA, which was completed in November 2010, \nclarified the necessary steps to liberalize financial services and the capital account and to \nfurther develop the capital markets as a region. However, ASEAN central banks and the ASEAN \nSecretariat recognize that each member state requires its own detailed implementation plan. \nThus, further ADB support is needed to prepare these plans. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n10.  The  small-scale  research  and  development  TA,  which  was  completed,  provided  a \nthorough and critical assessment of the current state of financial services liberalization, capital \nmarket development, and capital account liberalization in 10 ASEAN countries. The follow-on \nTA will provide the member states with their own implementation strategies and plans. This is \nnecessary because the readiness of the member states to undertake financial and capital \naccount liberalization is very different. It is necessary to customize the plans to ensure that they \nare suitable and feasible for each member state. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  detailed  implementation  strategies  to  liberalize  financial  services  and  capital \naccounts and further develop capital markets will enable ASEAN finance ministers and central \nbank governors to better understand and initiate the liberalization process step by step based \non specific milestones. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will: \n \n(i)  design  comprehensive  and  step-by-step  implementation  programs  for  each \nASEAN  member  country  to  achieve  the  financial  integration  of  ASEAN,  by \nspecifying  appropriate  implementation  milestones,  strategic  objectives,  and \npolicy  actions  with  their  respective  timelines  as  well  as  appropriate  tools  to \nperiodically monitor achievement of the milestones; different milestones will be \ndeveloped for the advanced and emerging ASEAN economies;   \n \n(ii)  identify gaps, constraints and challenges that may inhibit the financial integration \nof ASEAN, including thorough analysis of policy and regulatory issues to achieve \nintegrated financial markets in ASEAN; \n ", "  3\n(iii)  specify the preconditions, safeguard measures, and new initiatives needed for \nASEAN  member  countries  to  pursue  sound  and  prudent  ASEAN  financial \nintegration; \n \n(iv)  assess  if  concrete  timelines  have  been  set  for  the  existing  initiatives  and  if \nintegration is moving toward the set time frames, and determine if there is a need \nto accelerate the time frames to achieve the 2015 target; \n \n(v)  prioritize the complete set of initiatives, including new initiatives needed, to speed \nup and achieve the end-goals of ASEAN financial integration; and \n \n(vi)  provide best-practice models, based on other regional and country references, \nthat can be adapted to the ASEAN setting. \n \n13.  The TA assumes that the ASEAN Secretariat, regulators, finance ministries, and central \nbanks in all ASEAN member countries will provide support and cooperation to the consultants \nand  ADB.  Their  support  is  crucial  to  ensure  that  the  recommendations  contained  in  their \nimplementation plans are effective and realistic. \n \n14.  Risks may arise from the reluctance of the governments and central banks to provide \ntheir  support  because  of  possible  national  opposition  to  either  liberalization  or  to  certain \nrecommendations  and  milestones.  In  addition,  the  governments  may  maintain  certain \nrestrictions as negotiated and agreed as \u201cpre-agreed flexibility\u201d, which is contemplated in the \nAEC Blueprint. Another risk may arise from an unexpected economic crisis, which would delay \nthe whole process of economic integration. Although the region as a whole has weathered the \nimpact of the financial crisis, it remains vulnerable to additional shocks. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $725,000. The TA will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2014other \nsources). The detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency, and the Office of Regional Economic Integration will \nadminister  and  implement  the  TA  in  close  consultation  with  ASEAN  member  countries, \nparticularly ASEAN finance ministries and central banks. Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010, \namended from time to time).  \n \n17.  Five  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  a  total  of  28  person-months  of \ninternational consultancy services. The international consultants\u2019 inputs may be divided into two \nareas: (i) integration of banking sector financial services and capital account liberalization; and \n(ii) integration of nonbank financial sectors. As the study involves highly political issues, the \nASEAN officials will need to have a high level of confidence in the international consultants. The \nconsultants will be hired and engaged by ADB as individual consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline \nof the terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to be completed by August 2011. The consultants will provide a draft \nof the implementation plans for member states by February 2011. After incorporating comments \n ", "4  \nfrom member countries, the implementation plans will be revised and a regional strategy for \ncoordination and implementation will be prepared. The consultants will submit the final draft to \nthe ASEAN Finance and Central Bank Deputies Meeting in April 2011. If necessary, the report \nwill be revised to incorporate further comments.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $725,000 on a grant basis \nfor Assessing the Financial Landscape and Formulating Milestones for Monetary and Financial \nIntegration in ASEAN, Phase 2, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
