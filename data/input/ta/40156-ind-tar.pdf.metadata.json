A $200 million Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management Project1 is listed in the \n2009 lending pipeline, and the corresponding project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) of \n$1 million is listed in the 2007 nonlending pipeline of India\u2019s country operational business plan \n(COBP) 2007\u20132009. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission visited India from \n18 April to 7 May 2007 to discuss the scope, financing, and implementation arrangements of \nthis PPTA.2 The technical assistance (TA) project will be used to prepare an investment project \nfor  sustainable  coastal  protection  and  management  in  the  states  of  Goa,  Karnataka,  and \nMaharashtra. Assistance to these states may be considered the first phase of a multiphased \nassistance program which broadly supports India\u2019s National Coastal Protection Project (NCPP). \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Issues and Approaches in Coastal Protection \n \n2.  Nature of Coastal Erosion in India. All Indian maritime states and union territories are \nsubject to varying degrees of coastal erosion. Approximately 1,450 kilometers (km) or about \n26% of the country\u2019s mainland coastline is prone to erosion, causing an estimated loss of about \n450 hectares (ha) of land each year. Around 20\u201325% of India\u2019s population lives within 50 km of \nthe coast and around 70% of those people are in rural areas. It is these rural poor coastal \ncommunities who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of erosion. In fact, destitution is the \nvery reason that draws such people to the coastline in the first place, where they often encroach \non state reservations and make a subsistence living from the surrounding natural resource \nbase.  Coastal  erosion  hits  such  communities  hardest  since  it  destroys  their  property  and \ndisrupts their livelihoods. Many of India\u2019s rapidly growing urban areas are also vulnerable to \ncoastal erosion;  Mumbai, for example, incurs a cost of approximately $2.5 million per km on \ncapital works alone to protect some of its prime waterfront property. The impact of climate \nchange  is  likely  to  aggravate  coastal  erosion  even  further.  Sea  level  rise  in  the  Indian \nsubcontinent is projected to be between 15 and 38 centimeters (cm) by the middle of the 21st \ncentury, rising to between 46 and 59 cm by the end of the century. A 1 meter (m) rise in sea \nlevel in India would inundate about 5,700 square kilometers (km2) of land, affecting around 7 \nmillion people. \n \n3.  Financial Issues Relating to Coastal Protection. In 1991\u20131992, investment in erosion \nmitigation suffered a setback due to the cessation of central loan assistance. Constrained by \nlimited funds, state government investment in coastal protection measures has declined, and \nfunds have often been inadequate to address even urgent coastal protection works. Protection \nmeasures are typically taken up on an emergency basis, or in a bid to prevent impending \ndisasters. When the problem is addressed at such an advanced stage, the range of possible \nmitigation options is limited to a few structural measures (such as sea walls and groins). Most \noften, such measures amount to fixing the immediate symptom rather than addressing the \ncause of the problem. Since they are treated as emergency measures, coastal protection works \nare not held up to strict standards of technical and economic viability or environmental and \nsocial impact. Furthermore, due to the shortage of funds, maintenance work is rarely carried \nout. Consequently, most of these structures collapse within 3\u201310 years of construction. \n \n4.  Institutional Issues Relating to Coastal Protection. The mandate for coastal erosion \nmitigation is typically entrusted to a coastal division, which is subsumed within a larger state \n                                                 \n1  The project was formerly listed as the Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Sustainable Coastal Protection \nProject.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 June 2007. ", "2   \ndepartment  with  a  much  broader  mandate.  Consequently,  the  budget  for  coastal  protection \nmeasures is also subsumed within broader budget areas (such as roads, port development, flood \ncontrol, and irrigation). Similarly, the technical and human-resource capacity of the coastal divisions \nis limited; while most staff members are competent civil engineers with experience in executing civil \nworks, they have minimal experience with modern and sustainable coastal protection measures. \n \n5.  There is a need to improve coordination of various coastal protection initiatives, both at the \ncentral level as well as between central and state agencies. At the central level, the Coastal Policy \nDevelopment and Advisory Committee (CPDAC)3 coordinates various initiatives and provides \nstates with policy direction and technical advice on coastal protection; however, it lacks the \nstatutory authority to enforce its directives. The Central Water Commission (CWC) is the technical \narm of the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) and is responsible for coordinating the approval \nof  coastal  protection  projects  proposed  by  states.  However,  state-initiated  coastal  protection \nprojects are frequently carried out without specific approval by CWC. CWC also has the mandate \nto initiate centrally sponsored schemes for coastal protection but few significant initiatives have \nbeen taken thus far. Coordination between technical institutes providing advice to maritime states \non coastal  protection  measures also needs  to be improved.  The Central Water and  Power \nResearch Station (CWPRS) is the lead agency in this regard; in addition there are several other \ninstitutes  that  provide  specialized  technical  services  related  to  designing  coastal  erosion \nmanagement measures.4 In general, technical institutes in India have had limited experience in \ndesigning and implementing modern and innovative coastal protection measures. \n \n6.  Coastal Protection and Coastal Zone Management. Coastal erosion mitigation is \nintegrally linked with coastal zone management. The notification that regulates activities in the \ncoastal zone5 is due to be replaced by a new notification,6 and this will also have two significant \nimplications  for  future  coastal  protection  measures.  Firstly,  the  proposed  mapping  of  the \nvulnerability zone will determine the type of land uses and the design features of structures \n(such as buildings) that will be permitted within the coastal zone. This in turn will influence \ndecisions on the nature and extent of protection that must be accorded to different areas of the \ncoastal zone. Secondly, the introduction of a requirement to prepare coastal zone management \nplans will mandate planning and coordination of development activities in the coastal zone. \nCoastal protection measures will also need to be incorporated into such integrated coastal zone \nmanagement plans. However, the preparation and effective implementation of coastal zone \nmanagement plans is a long-term measure. Priority coastal protection measures and other \ndevelopment activities along the coastal zone will need to be undertaken in parallel with the \nintroduction of the coastal zone planning process. A World Bank project to assist the Ministry of \nEnvironment  and  Forest  to  implement  the  new  notification  is  currently  under  preparation.7 \nTherefore the TA project and the ensuing investment project will be designed to complement the \n                                                 \n3 CPDAC is headed by a member of the Central Water Commission (CWC). Representatives of coastal states and \nrelated central departments serve as members.  \n4  Other institutes with technical design capabilities are Integrated Coastal and Marine Area Management Project \nDirectorate, Chennai; National Institute of Oceanography, Goa; Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai; National \nInstitute of Ocean Technology, Chennai; National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Suratkal; Centre for Earth \nScience Studies, Thiruvananthapuram; and Karnataka Engineering Research Station, Maharashtra Engineering \nResearch Institute, and Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology, Poondi.  \n5 The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 1991. \n6 The new notification has been designed on the basis of recommendations of a technical advisory group that \nreviewed the existing CRZ notification. The Ministry of Environment and Forest was due to release the notification \nin mid-2006 but has not yet done so. \n7 The project, titled Coastal Zone Integrated Management, is expected to commence in mid\u20132008. The project will \nassist with (i) vulnerability and ecological mapping, (ii) institution and capacity building for integrated coastal zone \nmanagement, and (iii) investment in state-level pilot projects. Gujarat, West Bengal, and Orissa will participate in \nthis project; however, the World Bank may consider including one or two more states.  \n ", "  3\nefforts of the Ministry of Environment and Forest by introducing concepts of sustainable coastal \nprotection based on long-term shoreline management.8\n \nB.  State-Specific Issues \n \n7.  Issues Specific to Goa. The coast of Goa is 105 km long and is typically characterized \nby wide pristine beaches, sand dunes, and cliffs. As a result the coastal region of Goa has been \nsubject  to  high  development  pressure,  especially  for  tourism.  Poor  land-use  planning  and \nineffective enforcement of regulations have resulted in encroachment into ecologically sensitive \nareas such as sand dunes and wetlands. Partly as a consequence of this, Goa is now facing \nbeach erosion in certain areas such as Utorda and Betalbatim. At present the extent of erosion \nis relatively small (around 40 km); however, one such section of beach is of prime importance \nfrom a tourism perspective. A significant percentage of the state\u2019s economy and labor force \ndepends on tourism. Construction of sea walls would clearly negate the tourism potential of \nthese beaches; however, unless sustainable measures are adopted in advance, the options for \nprotection against erosion may be limited to hard structures.9  \n \n8.  Issues Specific to Karnataka. The Karnataka coastline is 280 km long, and about 250 \nkm (89%) is affected by erosion. The most severely affected areas are Ullal, Honnavar, Bhatkal, \nKundapur,  Bengre,  Mulki,  Bhavikeri,  and  Tannirbavi.  Coastal  protection  received  some \nprominence  in  the  state  after  the  Asian  tsunami  of  December  2004.  The  government  of \nKarnataka has a master plan for coastal erosion management upon which it based its proposal \nfor inclusion in the NCPP. The Karnataka coastline includes several stretches of wide beaches \nwhich could be developed into tourism or residential areas. The state wishes to address coastal \nprotection in such areas in a more systematic manner and adopt long-term measures with an \nemphasis on soft structures10 or nonstructural interventions 11 wherever possible.  \n \n9.  Issues Specific to Maharashtra. Maharashtra has a coastline of 720 km, of which \nabout 320 km (about 44%) is subject to erosion. Coastal urban areas such as Mumbai have \nbeen  severely  affected  by  erosion,  partly  due  to  clearance  of  mangroves  and  associated \nvegetation  along  the  shoreline  and  also  due  to  construction  of  offshore  and  coastal \ninfrastructure. Rural coastal districts such as Riagat and Palgrave have also been adversely \naffected by erosion. This has increased the vulnerability of resident coastal communities to \nnatural disasters (such as cyclones) since their dwellings are along the fringes of the shoreline. \nThe government of Maharashtra recognizes the need to address coastal protection in a more \nsystematic manner. The state is interested in identifying alternative coastal protection methods \nthat are compatible with the coastal activities and the environments that are to be protected, \nparticularly innovative coastal protection interventions that can be structured into financially \nviable projects, especially through public\u2013private partnerships.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The overall impact of the TA project will be (i) to contribute towards the improved \nwellbeing of coastal communities, (ii) greater sustainability of coastal ecosystems, and (iii) a \nreduction in loss of coastal property in Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. The TA project would \n                                                 \n8  Shoreline management is defined as a process to assess long-term shoreline changes, analyze options, and \nimplement sustainable long-term measures to prevent coastal erosion. \n9  Examples are sea walls, submerged groins and reefs, and detached breakwaters.  \n10  Examples are geotextile tubes, beach nourishment, dune management, sand bypassing (around obstructions), and \nshelter belts. \n11  Examples are set backs and zonation (to regulate land use patterns). \n ", "4   \nachieve this impact by designing innovative interventions for sustainable coastal protection and \nshoreline management planning.  \n \n11.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  project  will  comprise  (i)  a  framework  and  action  plan  for \nsustainable shoreline management; (ii) a corresponding investment program for each state, \ncomprising three to six fully appraised priority subprojects12 and a long list of outline designs for \nstructural and nonstructural interventions that would be studied in detail and financed during the \nensuing  loan  (subject  to  technical  and  economic  viability  and  social  and  environmental \nacceptability); and (iii) an investment proposal combining outputs (i) and (ii), prepared to meet \nADB\u2019s technical and economic viability requirements, and other due-diligence requirements of a \nproject loan. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA project will operate simultaneously along two parallel paths: (i) it will seek to \ndevelop a sustainable (long-term) planning and management process for coastal protection \nleading to the first output described in para. 11; and (ii) it will address urgent (short-to-medium \nterm) coastal protection requirements of the respective states under the second output listed \nabove. The TA project will seek to integrate the two outputs, thereby guiding state authorities to \neventually  adopt  sustainable  long-term  coastal  protection  strategies.  The  two  components \nrequired to achieve the TA project outputs are described below.  \n \n13.  Component  1:  Shoreline  Planning,  Institutional  Development,  and  Investment \nPlanning. The TA project will review coastal protection measures adopted by the participating \nstates, including ongoing interventions, policy and institutional frameworks, current strategies, \nand investment and funding plans. Based on the review, a design framework for sustainable \nlong-term shoreline management will be prepared to cover each stage of the process from \nplanning,13  financing,  implementation,  and  enforcement,14  to  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nThereafter,  action  and  investment  plans  will  be  prepared  to  enhance  each  of  the  stages \nmentioned above. Action plans will cover institutional development and capacity building at the \ncentral and state level, and investment plans will cover specific interventions for each stage. \nFinally,  these  action  and  investment  plans  will  be  packaged  into  an  investment  proposal \ncovering the three states.15 Since these are likely to be sector-like projects, necessary due-\ndiligence will be carried out to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard and other policies and \nguidelines. \n \n14.  Component 2: Detailed Designs of Site-Specific Subprojects. One or two sites from \neach state will be selected for detailed design and feasibility analysis of appropriate coastal \nprotection interventions.16 Detailed assessments of coastal processes operating at each site will \nbe undertaken, first by using a combination of existing data and new data.17 This will be \n                                                 \n12 One or two subprojects will be selected for detailed feasibility study from each state during the PPTA.  \n13 This will include (i) long-term shoreline mapping and trend analysis; and (ii) selection criteria for structural and \nnonstructural interventions, incorporating vulnerability factors.  \n14  This will include appraisal criteria for specific subprojects and procedures for operation and maintenance. \n15  Provision will be made for a separate investment package for central institutions. \n16 The criteria for selecting sites will be determined under component 1. Site selection will also be based on \navailability of data and other considerations (such as the ability to demonstrate viable public\u2013private partnerships \nassociated with the intervention). \n17  The TA project will utilize the available technical reports and project proposals of the participating implementing \nagencies, and data and analyses of government institutions. Where such data is unavailable or inadequate for the \npurpose of undertaking detailed technical designs of coastal protection measures, the TA project will commission \nfield measurements and studies for primary data collection. \n ", "  5\nfollowed  by  numerical  modelling18  (carried  out  using  an  iterative  approach)  to  design \nappropriate  coastal  protection  for  each  site  together  with  the  corresponding  social  and \nenvironmental impacts, associated costs, and detailed feasibility studies. These details will be \nincorporated into the investment proposal prepared under component 1, and submitted for \nconsideration of ADB financing under the ensuing loan.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA project is estimated at $1,260,000 equivalent. The TA project will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe grant will be for $1,000,000 equivalent and the participating state governments will finance \nthe remaining $260,000 equivalent through provision of office space, counterpart staff, survey \nand investigation data, reports, and analyses. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are \nshown in Appendix 3. The Government of India has been informed that approval of the TA \nproject does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n16.  The TA project will be implemented simultaneously in the three participating states. \nMOWR  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Water  Resources  Department  will  be  the \nimplementing agency (IA) in Goa, the Public Works Department will implement the TA project in \nKarnataka, while the Maharashtra Maritime Board will be responsible for implementation in \nMaharashtra. The three IAs will appoint TA project directors in their respective states with rank \nno less than superintending engineer. MOWR will form a TA project steering committee chaired \nby the MOWR secretary, with the participation of the heads of the IAs and representatives of \nother related union government line agencies (including Planning, Finance, Environment, and \nEarth Sciences) to provide policy guidance. Each state will establish a TA project working group \nto provide technical advice and monitor progress at state level. These working groups will \ncomprise senior staff of the IA and other related departments with functional responsibilities for \nfinance, revenue, environment and forests, land-use planning, metropolitan or urban councils, \nfisheries, tourism, industries, and ports. \n  \n17.  The TA project will be implemented over a period of 9 months from November 2007 to \nJuly  2008.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  a  team  of  international  and  national \nconsultants based in Goa. The total consulting services input of 60 person-months will comprise \n19 person-months of international consultants and 41 person-months of national consultants. \nThe breakdown of consultant inputs and the outline terms of reference are shown in Appendix 4. \nThe TA project team will be engaged by ADB through an international firm in association with \nnational firm(s) following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The firm will be selected following ADB's quality- and cost-based selection method \n(using  a  quality-to-cost  ratio  of  80:20)  based  on  full  technical  proposals.  The  TA  project \nequipment  will  be  procured  by  the  consulting  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment will pass to the government \nupon completion of the TA.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for preparing the Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n18 Typical data requirements for numerical modelling are bathymetry, wave (height, period, and direction), current \n(speed and direction), tide (amplitude and phase), sediment (grain size, density, and fall velocity), river discharge, \nand wind (speed and direction) measurements. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nReduction in loss of land  Measurements against baseline  \u2022 Individual states accept the \nTo contribute towards the \nand crops due to sea  conditions established during the  terms and conditions of \nimproved wellbeing of \nerosion.

The CSP emphasizes facilitation of poverty reduction \nthrough infrastructure-led growth. Accordingly, ADB has expanded operations in several sectors, including water \nmanagement, to better achieve this goal.  \n \nCoastal erosion poses a high risk to human wellbeing, economic development, and ecological integrity. Around 20\u2013\n25% of India\u2019s population live within 50 km of the coast, and the average population density of coastal states (455 \npersons per km2) is significantly higher than the national average (324 persons per km2). Almost 70% of the coastal \npopulation of India lives in rural areas, and it is the poor rural coastal communities that are most vulnerable to the \nimpacts of erosion. In fact, destitution is the very reason that draws many such people to the coastline in the first \nplace, where they often encroach on government-owned land and subsist from the surrounding natural resource base. \nCoastal erosion hits such communities hardest since it destroys their property and disrupts their livelihoods. \n \nEffective coastal erosion can improve the wellbeing of coastal communities through the prevention of losses to \nproperty, crops, and livelihoods. The TA project will contribute towards improved human wellbeing and ecological \nintegrity of the coastal zone of Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. This will be achieved by improving shoreline \nmanagement planning and formulating sustainable coastal protection measures for the abovementioned states. The \nTA project will also propose a range of structural and nonstructural interventions to arrest the rapid rate of coastal \nerosion and associated coastal deterioration.  \n   \nThe resulting long-term state coastal protection and management plans and implementation investment programs will \nintroduce  enhanced  sustainable  planning,  financing,  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance \nprocedures.  Emphasis  will  be  placed  on  coastal  community  participation  and  public\u2013private  partnership,  cost \neffectiveness, efficiency, transparency, and sustainability. These activities will be supplemented by site-specific \nnonstructural  interventions,  livelihood  enhancement,  and  coastal-community  development  programs,  and \nstrengthening  of  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  to  ensure  efficient  project  implementation.  Extensive \nconsultation with the project stakeholders throughout the TA project implementation will ensure the ownership of the \nplanning processes and outputs by the participating agencies.  \n \n \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe consultants will (i) prepare brief socioeconomic profiles of the selected subprojects; (ii) assess community \nwillingness to participate in subproject works and recommend participatory mechanisms for planning, selection, \ndesign, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of these works; (iii) conduct public meetings and dialogue to \nassess stakeholder priorities and the potential impacts of the identified options on the most vulnerable segments of \nsociety including the poor and women; (iv) prepare a strategy for incorporation of social development and poverty \nreduction including gender action plans, following ADB\u2019s handbook on poverty and social analysis; (v) suggest \nsubproject-specific interventions to implement poverty reduction and social strategies; and (vi) recommend follow-up \nactions, including the required resources and funding, for beneficiary participation, social development, and livelihood \nenhancement. The consultants will also review ongoing programs designed to stimulate inclusive rural economic \ngrowth and enhance and diversify the income of coastal communities. Such activities may include community \ndevelopment and empowerment, and livelihood support for the identified vulnerable groups. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002.

It will review options to eliminate such negative effects through design changes, or mitigate them \nthrough specific measures to be included in the project design and costed as part of the total project cost. The poverty \nanalysis will also review options to extend or enhance the benefits of the poor and vulnerable groups through design \nchanges in the scope or pace of the policy conditions. \n \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nPreliminary stakeholder assessment and analysis will be undertaken during the TA project. Stakeholders to participate \nin the project include men and women of the coastal communities in the target area, all tiers of government (central \nand state governments), research and academic institutions, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), civil society \norganizations, and the private sector where relevant and appropriate. Initial consultations with the communities will be \nundertaken during the preparation of the socioeconomic and poverty analysis. Public meetings will also be organized \nat  the  community  level  to  assess  community  priorities  and  potential  impacts  and  options.  Multistakeholder \nconsultations at the local government and national level will be conducted to share results of the assessments and \naction plans developed. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nBased on the stakeholder analysis that will be undertaken during the TA project, a strategy and action plan will be \nformulated which will seek to define the manner in which stakeholders may most effectively participate during the \nproject cycle. A strong emphasis will be made on ensuring fair representation of the interests and needs of each \ngroup, especially the poor and the most vulnerable. \n \n \n \nD.  Gender and Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nCoastal erosion affects women and men alike, particularly through the loss of their dwellings. In terms of livelihoods, \nloss of access to the shoreline affects fishing which again affects both men (engaged in capturing fish) and women \n(engaged in related activities such as net mending and processing) alike. However the TA project will incorporate \nspecific  measures  to  ensure  that  women  effectively  and  actively  participate  in  (i)  the  project  design,  (ii)  the \nidentification of options for coastal protection, and (iii) project implementation. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
