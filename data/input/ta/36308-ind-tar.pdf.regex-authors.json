INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program update for India1 for \n2006\u20132008 includes support for governance and public resource management reforms in the state \nof  Assam,  and  the  Subprogram  II  phase  of  the  Assam  Governance  and  Public  Resource \nManagement (AGPRM) program cluster loan is programmed.2 The government of Assam (GOA) is \nsupportive of ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA) to assess achievements in the broad areas under the \nfirst phase of the AGPRM. Based on the understanding of the outcomes achieved, it will further \nexplore new areas to be incorporated into Subprogram II of AGPRM. The major components will \ninclude sustainable and time-bound fiscal consolidation together with complementary governance \nreform for budgeting, expenditure, debt and asset management, and public sector enterprise (PSE) \nrestructuring and closure.  \n \n2.  This TA is part of ADB\u2019s support to prepare and implement the AGPRM program loan.3 The \nFact-Finding Mission visited Assam in July 2006 and reached an understanding with GOA on the \npurpose, output, methodology, key activities, cost estimates and financing plan, implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Economic Situation \n \n3.  Although Assam is rich in natural resources (particularly petroleum and coal) and has good \npotential for developing agriculture, its economic performance has lagged behind that of rest of \nIndia  because  of  several  factors,  especially  poor  infrastructure,  remoteness,  and  inability  to \nminimize crop damage from frequent floods. Assam\u2019s economic growth decelerated even further \nafter economic reforms in the early 1990s. While per capita gross state domestic product (GSDP) \ngrew by 3.63% on average from fiscal year (FY) 1981 to FY1994, growth decelerated to 2.63% in \n1994\u20132001. In the same period, growth in all states\u2019 per capita GSDP accelerated from 5.27% to \n5.72%. During FY2002, GSDP growth in Assam was a healthy 6.09%, dropping to 4.68% in \nFY2003. However, recently there has been acceleration in various sectors of the state\u2019s economy, \nwhich is estimated to have attained a growth rate of 5.90% in FY2005.4 The net state domestic \nproduct (NSDP) of Assam registered growth in real terms of 5.20% in FY2004, up from 4.09% in \nFY2003. It is expected that a growth rate of 6.2% in the NSDP in real terms will be achieved in \nFY2006.5  \n \n4.   Notwithstanding the improvement in economic growth, large revenue and fiscal deficits \nhave continued. The fiscal deficit had increased from Rs1,395 core in FY2004 to Rs2,058 crore in \nFY2005. State revenue consists mainly of state tax and other revenue, central tax transfers, and \ngrants-in-aid from the Government of India. Overall revenue receipts increased 14.33% on average \nfrom FY2001 to FY2005. The total expenditure of the state increased at an average trend rate of \n13.46% from FY2001 to FY2005. However, the growth rate for expenditure in FY2005 was 45.48%, \nfar outpacing the 5-year average.6 The current deficit represents the gap between GOA\u2019s receipts \nand expenditure. Even though the ratio of revenue deficit to fiscal deficit has decreased, with inter-\nyear variations, from 49.8% in FY2004 to 14.9% in FY2005, the state continues to suffer from \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

In view of the limited tax base and tax policy instruments, revenue \nmeasures alone will not be sufficient to reduce revenue deficits and fiscal deficits over the short \nterm. Accordingly, GOA will also need to adopt fiscal compression measures targeting expenditures \nto rein in deficits.  \n \nB.  Building on Achievements under Subprogram I  \n \n5.  Subprogram II of the AGPRM will help GOA design and sequence further public resource \nmanagement and governance reforms and strengthen its implementation capacity. Although, under \nSubprogram I, there has been significant movement towards (i) fiscal consolidation in Assam \nthrough  revenue  reforms,  (ii)  controlling  expenditure  growth,  and  (iii)  closing  several  non-\noperational PSEs, reform measures need to be consolidated further through (i) the identification \nand  removal  of  inefficiencies  in  tax  administration;  (ii)  better  budget  preparation,  execution, \nmonitoring, and control; (iii) further restructuring of PSEs; (iv) a refined voluntary retirement scheme \n(VRS) and strengthened social safety net; (v) better management of the debt portfolio; and (vi) \nexpansion of the tax base through initiatives that seek to promote greater investment, such as \npromoting  public-private  partnerships  (PPPs)  and  foreign  private  investment  in  tourism  and \ninfrastructure.  \n \n6.  Subprogram I was launched against a backdrop of constraints to GOA\u2019s accomplishing \nrevenue augmentation and expenditure compression. Progress was achieved with the approval of \nthe Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management (FRBM) Act. Although FY2005 saw the fiscal deficit \nincrease to 5.9% of GSDP, this was largely due to GOA\u2019s efforts to pay the arrears of the Assam \nState Electricity Board and its payment of interest arrears. Projections for FY2005\u2013FY2009 are \nencouraging regarding meeting the objective of reducing the fiscal deficit to close to 3% of GSDP \nand eliminating the revenue deficit by FY2009, as stated in the FRBM Act. A medium-term fiscal \nframework  was  approved  that  builds  measures  to  successfully  implement  a  medium-term \nexpenditure framework. In addition, controls on budget and expenditure management have been \nimproved to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of budget processing. A major contribution to \nthe  reduction  in  current  expenditure  is  expected  through  declining  interest  payments  (through \nswapping high-interest loans with low-interest loans from ADB and others), a freeze on the number \nof GOA posts, and the current policy of restricting new recruitment to 70% of attrition.  \n \n7.  Some of the major revenue-augmentation achievements under Subprogram I have been the \nintroduction of the value-added tax (VAT) with positive results, a policy decision to adopt  ad \nvalorem imposition of excise duty on Indian-manufactured liquor under foreign branding  notification \nof two composite check posts7, and the implementation of the Tax Information Management System \n(TIMS). However, given the narrow revenue base and inefficiencies in revenue administration, the \nkey challenges faced by GOA are building capacity for VAT audits, developing electronic tax filing, \nentering paper tax return forms in the TIMS, adopting objective valuation methods, and reducing \nhuman discretion in the valuation of properties. Subprogram II will need to address these issues \ncomprehensively  to  bring  effective  revenue  augmentation.  On  the  budget  and  expenditure-\ncompression side, GOA would need to become more performance-oriented by introducing results-\nbased indicators for key expenditure departments and improving budget formulation, monitoring, \nand reporting. Subprogram II will need to address some of these issues.  \n \n8.  With respect to reforming PSEs, of the seven non-operational PSEs identified for closure \nwhen the loan was negotiated, five have been closed, and it has recently been decided to close the \nother two. However, excluding the Assam Electricity Board, there are still 47 PSEs in Assam, of \n                                                 \n7  The modern and well-equipped composite checkposts have been set up at Srirampur and Boxirhat. The checkposts are \nstrategic entry posts into the state, and designed to enable relevant departments to check vehicles entering the state at \none place. This will improve the transparency of the checking process, and facilates interdepartmental coordination. \n ", "  3\nwhich 10 are non-operational, 16 are in severe financial crisis, 16 incur losses, and 5 enjoy \nprofitability.8 The PSEs operate in most sectors. Those involved in development through lending9 \nare in a poor state, typically with few of their loans performing. Those in the welfare sector are also \nineffective, and mergers of PSEs are under consideration. Most of the non-operational PSEs are in \nthe production sector. PSEs are organized in a variety of forms including limited liability companies, \ncentral  and  state-level  corporations,  cooperatives  managed  as  PSEs,  societies,  and  un-\nincorporated  businesses.  A  recent  development  has  been  the  joint-sector  company,  with  tax \nadvantages granted to the public-private arrangement. Government intervention over the last 5 \nyears  has  been  limited  to  several  areas.10 The  main  decision  has  been  to  close  some  non-\noperational PSEs, and the process continues. In this regard, Subprogram II will help GOA to begin \nthe process of closing PSEs identified as non-operational and so containing GOA\u2019s further fiscal \nexposure and enhancing VRS and social safety net. These measures will provide more training \nopportunities for discharged people and identify emerging skills demand in the job market in Assam, \nbased on a comprehensive study on the labor market and rising industries in Assam.  \n \n9.  Therefore, although there has been significant movement towards fiscal consolidation in \nAssam through revenue reforms, controlling expenditure growth, and closing non-operational PSEs, \nreform measures need to be consolidated further through (i) the identification and removal of \ninefficiencies in tax administration; (ii) better budget preparation, execution, monitoring, and control; \n(iii) further restructuring of PSEs; (iv) better management of the debt portfolio; and (v) expansion of \nthe  tax  base  achieved  through  enhanced  economic  activity  brought  by  PPP  promotion  and \ninvestment facilitation. GOA is planning to host a senior Assam Development Forum in January \n2007 in Guwahati, Assam. GOA will need to expend all efforts toward developing a good business \nclimate, improving governance, and enhancing public infrastructure. AGPRM Subprogram II is \nexpected to establish an enabling environment in terms of good governance and so facilitate \ninvestment in Assam.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  of  TA  will  be  to  further  improve  development  management  in  Assam  by \nimplementing a policy matrix for Subprogram II against the background of the reforms undertaken \nunder Subprogram I, and the outcomes of TA will be an agreed design of a policy matrix for the \nprogram loan and capacity built to implement it. TA will (i) identify the broad areas to be supported \nunder the Subprogram II loan toward better development management, (ii) prioritize key reform \nmeasures into an agreed policy matrix, and (iii) strengthen GOA\u2019s implementation capacity in the \nfollowing  areas:  (a)  reforming  state  finances  through  revenue  augmentation  and  better  debt \nmanagement; (b) reforming fiscal governance through better fiscal discipline, improved resource \nallocation, and better operational management; and (c) reorienting the role of the state from being a \n                                                 \n8  Of the five profit-making firms, two have not produced accounts for over 5 years, and all (except for Assam Apex \nWeavers and Artisans Co-operative Federation Limited) are in protected markets. The causes of PSE failure include (i) \ncapital cost overruns, (ii) large trading losses, (iii) excess plant capacity, (iv) overstaffing, (v) price controls, (vi) private \nsector competition, and (vii) failure to collect debts. The 47 PSEs employ 31,500 people, of which 54%, or 16,900, are \nemployed by Assam Tea Corporation (ATC). The total annual investment is around Rs44 crore, and annual losses are \naround Rs100\u2013Rs200 crore, of which the loss in ATC was Rs19,924 lakh in FY2004. However, only four PSEs have \naudited accounts to date, and figures are only approximate, understating the losses. The PSEs have negative net worth \nbased on book value, but their land and buildings have appreciated. \n9  Assam  Industrial  Development  Corporation  Limited,  Assam  Financial  Corporation,  Assam  Small  Industries \nDevelopment Corporation Limited, Assam Hills Small Industries Development Corporation Limited, Assam Minorities \nDevelopment and Finance Corporation Limited, Assam State Film (Finance & Development) Corporation Limited, etc. \n10 GOA\u2019s intervention includes, among a few other minor investments, (i) acquiring new vehicles for ATC, (ii) some \ninvestments in Assam Gas Company Limited, and (iii) designing VRSs in some companies, but rarely at a level to \neliminate losses. \n ", "4   \n \nprovider of services to a facilitator of services. TA will become an important bridge to support GOA\u2019s \nprioritizing of its reform measures to achieve the outcomes of Subprogram II. \n \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Component 1: Reform of State Finances. TA will (i) review the revenue-augmentation and \nadministration-facilitation exercise under Subprogram I; (ii) support strengthening VAT revenue \nadministration by preparing guidelines for auditing returns under VAT and by building the capacity \nof officials to undertake effective and efficient audits; (iii) assist in developing a system for electronic \nfiling of tax returns and exploring the adoption of technology to upload data from paper tax return \nforms; (iv) devise dealer education strategies; (v) identify process reengineering possibilities in the \nadministration of VAT, excise and stamp duties, and registration fees; (vi) explore options for \nintegrating systems of excise, transport, and forest departments at check gates linked to the TIMS; \n(vii)  support  strengthening  excise  administration  through  a  comprehensive  study  of  Excise \nDepartment organization; and (viii) support strengthening debt management through a study of the \nneeds for establishing a dedicated debt management office.   \n \n12.  Component  2:  Fiscal  Governance  Reforms.  TA  will  include  (i)  reviewing  the  fiscal \ngovernance exercise under Subprogram I; (ii) developing procedures for introducing results-based \nbudgeting, including defining departmental outcomes and outputs on a pilot basis, for which data \nwill need to be captured over a period of time; (iii) developing mechanisms for capturing data and \nproviding expenditure estimates for the operation and maintenance of asset-creating projects in the \nbudget, including the initiation of a pilot exercise for key departments; (iv) undertaking a feasibility \nstudy and preparation of an action plan for creating physical asset registers for GOA\u2019s assets, in \npreparation for moving toward accrual-based accounting; and (v) supporting the development of an \ninternal audit policy and preparing an outline of an internal audit manual. \n \n13.  Component 3: Reorienting the Role of the State. TA will (i) review the PSEs restructuring \nexercise  under  Subprogram  I,  (ii)  develop  detailed  mechanisms  for  operationalizing  the  State \nRenewal Fund,11 (iii) develop mechanisms to improve PSEs\u2019 disclosure and transparency systems, \n(iv) undertake a feasibility study for transferring commercial undertakings under administrative \ndepartments  as  PPPs  or  PSEs,  (v) develop  an  action  plan  for  VRSs\u2019  management  and \ndisbursement mechanisms, (vi) identify emerging skills demand in the job market in Assam based \non a study on the labor market and rising industries in Assam, (vii) functionally review selected \ndepartments to identify opportunities for retraining and redeploying employees, (viii) develop a PPP \nframework  including  model  concession  agreements  for  sectors  where  PPPs  would  be  more \neffective in Assam, (ix) prepare a business plan for operationalizing the single window mechanism \nfor industrial facilitation and investment promotion, and (x) prepare a strategy for the tourism sector \nand facilitate PPPs to promote tourism.12 \n                                                 \n11  There is always a risk that proceeds from the sale of assets in a PSE during a restructuring exercise will be used to \nfinance the current expenditure of the government. Ideally, these proceeds should be used for capital expenditure to \nimprove infrastructure and support further economic growth. This makes imperative creating the separate State \nRenewal Fund to receive proceeds from PSE restructuring. \n12 Assam is the gateway to northeastern India, with rich flora and fauna. It is renowned for its tea and the world famous \none-horned rhino in the Kaziranga National Park. There is significant scope for river tourism, as the majestic \nBrahmaputra River flows through the state. Assam also has potential for religious tours to the Kamakhya temple \nsituated in Guwahati. With its natural beauty, Assam has been trying to make tourism one of the major sectors to \ngenerate employment and defuse its insurgency problems. This makes imperative preparing a comprehensive strategy \nfor the tourism sector and an action plan for facilitating PPPs. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  TA is estimated to cost $625,000 equivalent. Of this, $500,000 will be a grant from the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of India will provide \n$125,000  equivalent  to  finance  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  transport,  and  other \nexpenses such as workshops and facilitating in-country study. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government of India has been informed that approval of TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Finance Department of the state of Assam will be the executing agency for TA. The \nFinance  Department  will  be  supported  by  the  Fiscal  Management  Unit  (FMU)  set  up  under \nSubprogram I of AGPRMP. The project director of FMU will act as the nodal person for this TA. The \nstate Finance Department will provide office space, furniture, equipment, and counterpart staff for \nTA consultants, who will receive operational advice and guidance from the FMU project director. \nGOA will set up a steering committee, co-chaired by the commissioner and secretary of the Finance \nDepartment,  with  the  project  director  acting  as  the  secretary  to  the  steering  committee.13 All \nprocurement  of  equipment  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, and all equipment will be handed over to GOA at completion of TA.    \n \n16.  ADB will engage a team of consultants to execute TA. International consultants will work for \n7 person-months, and national consultants for 49 person-months. A firm of consultants will be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  For \nselecting consulting firms, simplified technical proposals and quality and cost-based selection will \nbe used. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4, and a summary initial \npoverty and social analysis report is provided in Appendix 2. The consultants will prepare an \ninception report, including a time-bound work plan for TA implementation, within 4 weeks of the \nstart of consulting services. An interim report will be submitted within 4 months of the start of \nconsulting services. A draft final report will be submitted 4 weeks before the end of consulting \nservices, to be discussed in a meeting of the consultants, GOA, and ADB before being finalized. \nThe final report will contain all the necessary information and analyses including recommended \npolicy changes (the policy matrix) and implementation arrangements. TA will be implemented over \n7 months, expected to start in February 2008 and be completed by September 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government of \nIndia  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund  for  preparing  the  Assam \nGovernance and Public Resource Management Subprogram II, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                 \n13 The  steering  committee  should  have  representation  from  the  Finance  Department,  Planning  and  Development \nDepartment, Administrative Reforms and Training Department, Department of Public Enterprises, and other key line \ndepartments.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in India: \n \nAccording to provisional results from the Census of India 2001, the population of Assam stood at 26.64 million. The \nliteracy rate in Assam is 64.28%, which is a bit lower than the national average of 65.38%. Thirty-five percent of \nAssam\u2019s population lives below the poverty line of Rs400 per capita per month, which is a rate higher than the \nnational average. \n \nThe growth of Assam\u2019s economy looked encouraging in FY2004/2005 and is likely to register an upward trend in the \ncoming years. Over the past few years, Assam has endured lots of constraints such as a stringent financial position, \nan insurgency problem, and recurrent natural calamities in the form of floods, erosion, and drought. Despite these \nconstraints, Assam has been able to achieve considerable progress in diverse fields, as reflected in the growth of \nstate domestic product over the last several years. \n \nSubprogram  II  of  the  Assam  Governance  and  Public  Resource  Management  Reform  Program  (AGPRM)  will \ncontribute to poverty reduction in Assam in several ways. From the macroeconomic perspective, efficient revenue \nadministration  and  continuing  PSE  reform  under  the  AGPRM  will  improve  the  fiscal  balance  and  reduce  the \nvulnerability of Assam\u2019s economy to external shocks. Reducing the downside risks to macroeconomic instability will \nmitigate the risk of disorderly adjustment and so limit adverse effects on people\u2019s living standards and on the \nvulnerable poor. Moreover, increased transparency and efficiency in resource allocation through the result-based \nbudget and expenditure initiative, will reduce fiscal leakage and free up resources that can be used for poverty \nreduction through investments in social infrastructure and expanding the social safety net. Furthermore, through \nidentifying opportunities for retraining and redeploying employees, vulnerable and poor people  will have more \nopportunities to be trained and financed under poverty relief program. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Planning Commission of India has been estimating the incidence of poverty nationally and statewide, both rural \nand urban, since the 6th Five Year Plan and making projections of minimum needs. If needed, a poverty impact \nassessment for the program loan may be done. \n \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes    No  \n \nConsultations will need to be identified during project design. The general public, government, representative \nassemblies, civil society organizations, and the private sector will be stakeholders. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes   No \n \nStakeholder participation will be needed to implement PSE reforms. A consultation and feedback process will be \nconsidered. Moreover, workshops and seminars will be held to facilitate resulted-based budgeting and to enhance \ngovernment officials\u2019 capacity toward undertaking efficient tax audits and electronic tax return filing.   \n \n \nD.
