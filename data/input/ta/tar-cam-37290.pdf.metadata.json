The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) 2003 country strategy and program update for \nCambodia1 includes the provision of advisory technical assistance (TA) for Community Self-\nReliance  and  Flood  Risk  Reduction,  proposed  for  financing  under  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation Fund (PRF) in 2004.2 The Government's National Poverty Reduction Strategy \n2003\u20132005  (NPRS)  and  Second  Five  Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  2001\u20132005 \n(SEDP-II) define development strategies and set targets for rural poverty alleviation, including \nthe  reduction  of  risks  posed  by  natural  disasters.  Assisting  rural  poor  affected  by  natural \ndisasters meets the priorities of the Government and ADB. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited  Cambodia  from  28  September  to  5  October  2004,  corresponding  to  the  general \ninundation of the floodplains in the lower Mekong River. The Mission reached an understanding \nwith  the  Government  on  the  goal,  purpose,  scope,  cost,  implementation  and  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Floods  as  a  Way  of  Life.  Rural  life  in  the  lowland  areas  of  Cambodia  is  linked \ninseparably with the annual cycle of flooding. While rainfall is partly responsible for this cycle, \nfloods in the Mekong River are the primary cause. About 3 million people earn subsistence-level \nincomes from fishing in the Tonle Sap Lake and other seasonally flooded areas of Cambodia, \nand fish account for 60% of the protein intake of the population. Up to 65% of cultivated land is \ncovered each year by floodwaters. Rather than viewing normal floods as disasters, persons \nliving in these areas consider them a source of livelihood and sustenance. Floods directly affect \nup to 3.4 million of Cambodia\u2019s 13.1 million people. Communities have developed ways of \ncoping with floods that last up to 6 months a year. Hence, annual floods become disasters only \nwhen they are deeper than average, unexpectedly fast in onset, or unusually prolonged. \n \n3.  Disastrous floods do occur in Cambodia, and with increasing frequency in recent years. \nThe International Center for Urban Safety Engineering at the University of Tokyo reported that \nthe frequency of floods in Asia doubled during 1978\u20131999, and that the rate of increase has \nbeen more pronounced in the past 10 years.3 The floods of 2000, 2001, and 2002 in Cambodia \nwere more severe than the average of recorded floods, and their sequential occurrence meant \nthat much of the damage had not been fully repaired before the next flood arrived. The 2000 \nflood, which affected 19 of Cambodia\u2019s 24 provinces and municipalities, left 347 people dead\u2014\n80% of whom were children.4 In addition to causing loss of life due to drowning and illness, \nthese floods destroyed crops, houses, and other possessions; killed livestock; and worsened \npoverty in rural areas. Their recurrence at short intervals was particularly devastating for poor \nfarmers and fisherfolk, who often must borrow to recover from the floods (replanting of crops, \npurchase of inputs and livestock, and repair of houses and fishing gear). The burden is much \nmore onerous when the areas that suffer from flooding during the wet season also experience \ndroughts, a frequently occurring phenomenon in Cambodia.5 Within Cambodia, the provinces of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003 Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006): Cambodia.

Phnom Penh: Mekong River Commission. \n5  A severe drought followed the 2001 flood and preceded the 2002 flood. The ability of flood-affected communities to \nwithstand droughts is increased if their vulnerability to floods (and hence their loss of livelihood assets) is lessened.  \n ", "2   \nKampong Cham, Kandal, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and Takeo in the lower Mekong River basin \nare among the most seriously affected areas. These provinces are among the poorest (25\u201375% \npoor), and are priority areas for assistance to reduce vulnerability to flooding, droughts, or both.6 \nAn initial poverty and social analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Flood and Drought Management. The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(MOWRAM)  has  primary  responsibility  for  managing  floods  and  droughts,  as  well  as  for \ndeveloping and managing large-, medium-, and small-scale irrigation and drainage projects. \nGovernment-funded flood management projects tend to concentrate on structural measures \nwhose scale is beyond the capacity of individual communities to design and implement. They \ninclude the embankments surrounding Phnom Penh, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and Kampong \nCham; and several schemes designed to eliminate floods from agricultural land on the fringes of \nthe Mekong River floodplain.7 Given the absence of major storage reservoirs and the difficulty of \ndiverting Mekong River water to remote areas, Cambodia has little capacity for drought relief. \n \n5.  The Mekong River Commission (MRC) assisted MOWRAM in expanding and improving \nits hydrological network in 1996. Water level data from major catchments within Cambodia and \nat key points along the Mekong River now are recorded and analyzed systematically. During the \nflood season (June\u2013November), MRC broadcasts daily flood heights and corresponding risks at \nkey  points  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  MOWRAM\u2019s  Department  of \nHydrology and River Works also broadcasts flood levels to affected districts within Cambodia.  \n \n6.  Recognizing the actual and potentially severe impact of recurrent disasters8 on the \nachievement  of  Cambodia\u2019s  development  and  poverty  reduction  goals,  the  Government \nestablished  the  National  Committee  for  Disaster  Management  (NCDM)  in  1995.  NCDM  is \ncharged  with  leading  pre-disaster  risk-reduction  measures  (prevention,  preparedness,  and \nmitigation), as well as coordinating emergency response during and after disasters. However, \nNCDM is underfunded and lacks full authority to undertake its coordinating role.9 Its provincial- \nand  district-level  agencies\u2014Provincial  Committee  for  Disaster  Management  (PCDM)  and \nDistrict Committee for Disaster Management (DCDM), respectively\u2014are constrained similarly. \n \n7.  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  at  the  Community  Level.  Several  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  have  programs  in  Cambodia  to  mitigate  flood  damage  and  improve \ncommunity disaster preparedness.10 Those of CARE Cambodia (CARE) in Prey Veng Province \nprovide good examples of the potential benefits, and inherent difficulties, of such work. \n \n8.  CARE\u2019s Disaster Preparedness Action Planning Project (DPAP), which the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID) funded, was implemented during 2001\u20132003 in \n                                                 \n6  World Food Program. 2003. Poverty and Vulnerability Analysis Mapping in Cambodia. Phnom Penh. \n7  The relatively minor flood control embankments constructed so far do not impinge significantly on the floodplain. As \nsuch, they do not hinder Mekong River flood flows. However, road embankments and other structures that interfere \nwith the normal passage of floods are increasing, diminishing the beneficial impacts of flooding and sometimes \nworsening depth and duration locally. \n8  Disasters include floods and droughts, as well as storms, landslides, forest fires, environmental degradation, spills \nof toxic materials, industrial accidents, and epidemics. \n9  The Council of Ministers has not approved a national policy for disaster management, which was drafted in 1997. \n10  The NGOs active in the provinces of Kandal, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and Takeo in the lower Mekong River basin \nare (i) Kandal: Action Against Hunger; Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation (CEDAC); \nConcern; Save the Children Australia; (ii) Prey Veng: Cambodian Red Cross; CARE Cambodia; Fisheries Action \nCoalition Team; Organization to Develop Our Villages; Oxfam GB; V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res (VSF); Women \nOrganization of Modern Economy and Nursing; (iii) Svay Rieng: CARE Cambodia; Church World Services; \nCEDAC; Oxfam GB; and (iv) Takeo Province: CEDAC; Oxfam GB; and VSF. \n ", "  3\nresponse to the 2000 floods.11 DPAP focused on (i) mitigation action planning (MAP), which \ninvolved local communities developing and implementing their own mitigation plans using small \ngrants; (ii) disaster preparedness action planning (PAP), based on a participatory analysis of \nvulnerability  and  capability,  also  implemented  using  small  grants;12  and  (iii)  disaster \nmanagement through savings (based on an earlier CARE pilot for mobilizing savings to help \nminimize the worst effects of disasters). \n \n9.  An evaluation of DPAP compared pre-implementation conditions in 2001 with conditions \nafter the 2002 flood. It showed that DPAP significantly decreased the impact of flooding in the \ntarget areas, saved lives and livestock, increased rice yields, improved access to services and \ngoods, and built affordable credit and savings to cushion future shocks.13 The major lessons \nwere \n  (i)  rural communities have the capacity to work together to reduce their vulnerability \nto  disasters,  and  their  traditional  coping  mechanisms  are  highly  appropriate \n(although inadequate in the face of increasingly severe disasters); \n  (ii)  immediately  after  disasters,  villagers  initiate  rescue  and  relief  activities  long \nbefore officials and other sources of aid arrive on site; \n  (iii)  DPAP suffered from delays, overly ambitious targeting, spreading available funds \ntoo thin, insufficient staff, staff recruitment problems, and short project life; \n  (iv)  although all components were planned and implemented in close partnership \nwith commune and village officials, the allocation of work among villagers was \nunequal,  an  effective  mechanism  to  selectively  target  the  most  vulnerable \nhouseholds was missing, and the setting of wage rates lacked transparency; \n  (v)  women are affected more directly and in more ways than men by disasters, due \nlargely to the need for women to continue to meet all of their work obligations\u2014\nand  often  additional  responsibilities\u2014under  extremely  difficult  circumstances, \nwhile men leave disaster areas in search of employment; and \n  (vi)  insufficient funds were provided to ensure adequate construction quality. \n \n10.  Based  on  lessons  learned  under  DPAP,  CARE  is  implementing  the  Disaster \nPreparedness  and  Mitigation\u2500Living  Above  the  Floods  (DPM\u2500LAF)  Project  in  Prey  Veng. \nFunded by AusAID and Norway for implementation in 2004\u20132006, DPM-LAF shifts the focus to \nhousehold-level interventions. It also incorporates the humanitarian accountability principles \nbeing  introduced  by  prominent  NGOs,  including  Cambodian  Red  Cross,  CARE,  Concern, \nLutheran World Federation, Oxfam GB, and World Vision.14\n \n11.  NGO interventions tend to be disparate, weakly coordinated with other similar initiatives, \npoorly funded, and without guarantee of long-term support. They do not reach a majority of the \naffected community in flood-affected areas. In addition, although CARE and other NGOs are \naware of the disproportionate impact of disasters on women, their capacity to develop and \nimplement gender-sensitive approaches needs to be strengthened. Agencies active in this field \nurgently need to adopt common standards and approaches, including a gender strategy. A \n                                                 \n11  DPAP covered 115 villages in four districts (Baphom, Kampong Trabek, Peam Chore, and Preah Sdach). \n12 MAP and PAP grant funds provided 71 boats, 123 radios, improvements to 12 irrigation schemes, 12 community \nand 350 family safety hills, rehabilitation of roads in 8 communes, and rehabilitation of 8 schools. \n13 Eng, S., Pann, S., Ramage, I. 2003. Final Evaluation Report\u2014Disaster Preparedness Action Planning in Prey \nVeng. Phnom Penh. \n14 The humanitarian accountability principles are (i) commitment to humanitarian standards and rights; (ii) informing \nright-bearers  about  the  program,  standards,  principles,  and  mechanisms  to  be  used;  (iii)  right-bearers'  full \nparticipation in the program; (iv) providing mechanisms for addressing complaints; and (v) partners' commitment to \nimplementing these principles. \n ", "4   \nprogrammatic  approach\u2014coordinating  current  and  future  interventions\u2014would  increase  the \nefficiency of externally funded projects, and distribute aid assistance more equitably. Under \nsuch circumstances, MOWRAM and its development partners could incorporate community-\nbased interventions into disaster risk-reduction projects more readily to magnify the impacts of \nNGO efforts and spread the benefits over a larger target area. \n \n12.  Community resilience to external shocks also could be increased greatly by improving \nnetworks and organizational capacity, disseminating site-specific flood forecasts to isolated \ncommunities, and raising communities\u2019 awareness of available emergency assistance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA is expected to be reduced vulnerability of rural communities to \nfloods and droughts. Its output will be improved participatory flood risk management for targeted \nvulnerable communities in the lower Mekong River basin provinces of Cambodia. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will be implemented in two phases: (i) strategy development (6 months) to \nformulate  a  methodology  for  mobilizing  communities  to  plan,  design,  and  implement \npreparedness, prevention, and mitigation measures; and (ii) capacity development (8 months) to \ntrain  government  staff,  NGOs,  and  leaders  to  implement  the  strategy.  The  strategy  and \nimproved capacity would be directly applicable to flood management initiatives in Cambodia, \nincluding ADB's 2007  flood management project to be identified under the ongoing TA in \nsupport of MRC\u2019s flood management and mitigation program.16 \n \n15.  The TA will (i) assess the effectiveness of ongoing and previous NGO interventions; (ii) \nselect target areas based on vulnerability to floods and droughts, incidence of poverty, and \nlocations of previous and ongoing interventions; (iii) design a community participation model \nbased on a strategy of proactive disaster risk reduction; (iv) undertake a baseline survey in the \ntarget  area;  (v)  formulate  the  risk-reduction  strategy,  including  a  gender  strategy  to  make \ndisaster  efforts  more  responsive  to  women\u2019s  and  children's  needs;  (vi)  select  NGOs  to \nimplement  the  strategy  through  local  communities;  (v)  train  government,  NGO  staff,  and \ncommunity leaders in strategy implementation; and (vii) supervise priority works17 as practical \ntraining in strategy implementation. Priority works will be selected based on need, community \ncapacity, efficacy, and replicability over a broad area. ADB's Operations Manual18 justifies such \nworks as \"pilot testing of projects with innovative approaches.\u201d The PRF Board paper19 also \nsupports  \"innovative  activities  such  as  micro  and  pilot  projects,  with  clear  demonstration \neffects.\" The TA will respond to the need for greater accountability in the provision of assistance \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2003.

The cost of the TA is estimated at $590,000, comprising foreign exchange cost of \n$194,400 and local currency cost of $395,600 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $500,000, including the entire foreign exchange cost and $305,600 equivalent of local \ncurrency cost. The Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund will finance the TA through a grant, \nwhich ADB will administer. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent to $90,000, by providing office accommodation, transport, remuneration and per \ndiem of counterparts, administrative support, performance monitoring surveys, and data and \nmaps. The cost estimate and financing plans are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOWRAM  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  and  will  coordinate  the \nimplementation  of  activities  with  the  Provincial  Departments  of  Water  Resources  and \nMeteorology (PDWRAM) and the PCDMs. A steering committee, chaired by the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance, will be established. It will include members from MOWRAM, Ministry of \nRural Development, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, Cambodian Red Cross, NCDM, and others. \nThe tasks of the steering committee would include (i) review and commenting on TA outputs, \nspecifically  the  assessment  of  ongoing  or  previous  programs  for  disaster  management \nimplemented  by  NGOs;  (ii)  prioritization  of  target  areas;  and  (iii)  detailed  implementation \narrangements,  including  selection  of  NGOs  to  be  contracted.  The  steering  committee  is \nexpected to meet three times during the TA. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months. It is expected to commence in July 2005 \nand end in August 2006, allowing physical works to be completed within the 2006 dry season. A \nfirm  of  international  consultants  associated  with  domestic  consultants  will  be  selected  to \nimplement the TA. Implementation will require an estimated 83 person-months of international \nand domestic consulting services, with core expertise in (i) flood management (team leader), (ii) \nsocial development, (iii) community development and participation, (iv) training, and (v) others, \nas  necessary.  Selected  NGOs  will  be  contracted  to  carry  out  a  baseline  survey,  conduct \ntraining,  and  implement  priority  works.  The  consultants  and  NGOs  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The quality and cost-based \nselection method and simplified technical proposals will be used. Outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are shown in Appendix 4. Procurement of equipment will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Reports  will  be  prepared  on  the \neffectiveness of specific NGO interventions, the findings of the study phase, and the results of \nthe implementation phase. Progress reports will be submitted quarterly. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia, to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nCommunity Self-Reliance and Flood Risk Reduction, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nand Targets  Mechanisms   and Risks \n \nImpact     \nReduced vulnerability of  Reduced loss of life,  Annual monitoring and \nrural communities to  property, and livelihood  damage assessment \nfloods and droughts.  assets from the baselines  reports of the Ministry \n  surveyed under this  of Water Resources \n  technical assistance (TA).  and Meteorology \n  (MOWRAM). \nOutcome       \nImproved participatory  MOWRAM and its  Monitoring and   \nflood risk management  Provincial Departments of  evaluation reports of \nfor targeted vulnerable  Water Resources and  MOWRAM and \ncommunities in the lower  Meteorology (PDWRAMs)  PDWRAMs \nMekong River basin.  adopt participatory risk- (undertaken as part of \nreduction strategy as  the strategy). \nstandard operating   \nprocedure.   \n   \nThe strategy implemented  Final report of TA \nin conformity with agreed  consultants. \nprinciples in at least 80% \nof targeted communities. \n     \nOutputs \n1.

An estimated 36% of Cambodians live in \npoverty. The population density is 69 persons per square kilometer (km2). Annual population growth is \nestimated at 2.3%. Due to the post-1979 baby boom, at least half of the population is under 18 years old. \nThe proportion of women in the adult population is high (56% of those 18 years or above). Infant mortality \nis also high. \n \nThe vast majority of the poor (85\u201390%) live in rural areas, where shortage of productive land and recurrent \nnatural disasters are compounding constraints. Natural disasters, such as floods and drought, destabilize \npeople\u2019s lives and undermine food and financial security, health, and education. The main problems \naffected families face tend to occur after natural disasters, particularly food shortages (specifically rice) \nand lack of inputs to restore livelihoods. This reflects the precarious dependence of many rural poor on a \nsingle crop as staple food and source of income.1 For the most vulnerable among Cambodia\u2019s poor, \nescaping  indebtedness  is  a  major  preoccupation.  Reducing  the  risk  of  disaster  through  improved \ncommunity organization and enhancement of simple coping strategies has been effective in improving \nresilience to natural disasters. \n \nLink with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s country strategy and program for Cambodia: The overall \nstrategic objective of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Cambodia is poverty reduction. ADB's country \nstrategy and program (CSP) defines three priority areas in support of Cambodia's Second Five Year \nSocioeconomic Development Plan 2001\u20132005 (SEDP-II): (i) rural economic development, (ii) human \nresources development, and (iii) private sector development. The technical assistance (TA) will reduce \npeople's vulnerability to floods and droughts, reducing poverty directly in poor rural communities. It also \nwill assist human resources development through improvement of community self-reliance. The TA is in \nline with ADB's Tonle Sap Initiative, and its support for the Mekong River Commission's flood management \nand mitigation program. \n \nAchieving the medium-term goals of the Poverty Partnership Agreement (PPA) between Cambodia and \nADB requires concerted action to overcome key problems affecting sustainable management of natural \nresources. The PPA promotes public-private partnerships and community participation in environmental \nmanagement. The TA will help meet this strategic objective by working with rural communities to identify \nand implement appropriate risk-reduction strategies. \n \nLink with National Poverty Reduction Strategy: The Government's National Poverty Reduction Strategy \n2003\u20132005 (NPRS) and SEDP-II define development strategies and set targets for reducing rural poverty. \nRelevant priority poverty reduction actions defined in the NPRS are (i) improving rural livelihoods, (ii) \nimproving capabilities, (iii) reducing vulnerability, (iv) strengthening social inclusion, and (v) promoting \ngender equity. To assist poor rural communities, NPRS aims to lower the risks posed by natural disasters \nas part of a broad program of improved natural resources management. The national water resources \nstrategy identifies flood mitigation and disaster prevention as priority initiatives. In support of these national \nagendas, the TA will enhance the effectiveness of rural communities' traditional coping mechanisms; \nimplement simple and replicable flood-proofing measures; and strengthen community capacity through \nparticipatory planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. The TA will incorporate strategies \nfor making disaster prevention and mitigation efforts more responsive to the needs of women and children \n(for whom the negative impacts of floods are particularly severe).  \n                                                 \n1  Families with several sources of income are less vulnerable in this situation, and less likely to exploit available \nnatural resources in an unsustainable way. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? The TA will focus on a maximum of two provinces, chosen \nfrom among Kandal, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and Takeo\u2014provinces where flood and drought impacts are \nparticularly severe. During the first phase of the TA, a poverty analysis will be conducted to help determine \nthe most appropriate target areas for TA activities. The poverty analysis will identify constraints and \nbarriers faced by the poor, and will guide the formulation of practicable eligibility criteria and means of \ntargeting beneficiaries. To help maximize the poverty reduction and social development outcomes of the \nTA, an assessment of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks will be conducted. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \nA  participatory  approach  was  adopted  during  TA  fact-finding.  An  initial  workshop  was  held  with \ngovernment  officials,  NGOs,  and  village  representatives  to  establish  the  objectives,  scope,  and \nimplementing arrangements of the TA. In the field, focus group discussions were held separately with \nwomen, men, and youth to assess needs, priorities, and capacities to contribute and benefit from the \nproject.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \nIn the past, disaster mitigation projects have been most successful when the communities are involved in \nplanning and implementation of risk-reduction measures. Through community participation, vulnerable \ngroups can be transformed into disaster-resilient communities, capable of withstanding and recovering \nfrom  shocks  to  their  physical  and  socioeconomic  environments.  The  TA  will  develop  a  community \nparticipation model to strengthen community involvement in the planning and implementation of project \nactivities. The aim of this model is to (i) reduce vulnerabilities and increase the capacity of vulnerable \ngroups and communities to cope with, prevent, or minimize loss of, or damage to, life, property, and the \nenvironment; (ii) minimize human suffering; and (iii) hasten recovery. Specific interventions that can \nreduce  vulnerabilities  and  strengthen  capacity  to  cope  with  hazards  will  be  based  on  a  thorough \nassessment of the communities\u2019 exposure to hazards, and an analysis of their specific vulnerabilities and \ncapacities. The model also will incorporate measures to strengthen social support structures, establish a \ncommunity  spirit  of  cooperation,  institutionalize  disaster  planning  and  preparedness,  form  voluntary \nresponse committees, and provide leadership training to enhance decision-making at the community level. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Women in Cambodia do not enjoy equal access to education, \npaid employment, land ownership, and other property rights. In family and society, they are generally in a \ndisadvantaged position. Women also suffer from poor reproductive health services.  \n \nThe increasing occurrence of severe flooding in the lower Mekong River basin is causing extensive \ndamage to property and the environment with an inordinate impact on women. Poor living conditions \nincrease  threats  to  women\u2019s  health  and  economic  insecurity,  and  limit  their  empowerment  in  the \ncommunity. Crop destruction and debts incurred as a result of flooding compel families to seek money \nfrom whatever sources are available. As most families have no or limited stocks of rice to sell, the strategy \nmost commonly adopted to repay debts is for men to seek employment elsewhere. This strategy increases \nthe workload of women, creating severe hardships for women and girls.  \n \nThe TA will reflect the urgent needs of women for whom floods and droughts have specific gender-\ndifferentiated impacts. These include (i) added burden of providing care (for children and sick, disabled, or \nold family members) as a single parent during the absence of husbands; (ii) added stress caused by \nworries about drowning of children and other family members; (iii) dependence on their husband\u2019s timely \nreturn to assure payment of incurred debts (in those cases where men have left the village to seek \nemployment elsewhere); and (iv) increased risk of sexually transmitted infections when husbands return \nfrom work outside the village. Assistance channeled through local authorities does not always reach the \nneediest. Instead, assistance tends to reflect the local authorities' lack of special provisions for vulnerable \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \ngroups, such as female-headed households. Another reason for women's limited access to benefits is the \nrelative inaccessibility of distribution centers. The cost of transportation alone prevents many women from \nreaching distribution centers. In some cases, women cannot leave their homes because they have no one \nto take care of children or sick family members. Recognizing this situation in the project area, the TA will \ndevelop a gender action plan to promote reduction of vulnerability of women to future risks, and promote \ngender equity more broadly.  \n \nThe gender action plan will include (i) strategy to ensure gender equity in access to project benefits; (ii) \ncollection of gender-disaggregated data through social analysis; (iii) systemic effort to address gender \ninequalities  in  project  service  delivery;  (iv)  participation  of  women  in  project  planning,  design, \nimplementation, and monitoring and evaluation of their specific needs; (v) representation of female staff at \nall  levels  of  project  management,  and  equal  opportunities  for  training;  and  (vi)  equal  wage  labor \nopportunities for women, if relevant. Components of the gender action plan, which will be elaborated \nduring the TA, include:  \n \n(cid:131)  Decision-making  structures:  to  increase  women\u2019s  involvement  in  disaster  management \ncommittees at provincial, district, and village levels;  \n(cid:131)  Participation: to ensure the equitable participation of women in disaster management, and post-\ndisaster reconstruction and rehabilitation;  \n(cid:131)  Access to information: to ensure women\u2019s equitable involvement in preparedness, prevention, \nand mitigation planning; and their access to information on land rights, land ownership, and legal \nservices; \n(cid:131)  Reconstruction: to ensure women\u2019s participation in the selection of TA-financed priority works, \nand equitable involvement in rehabilitation of infrastructure and basic services; and \n(cid:131)  Sexual and gender-based violence: to develop specific measures to enable women to protect \nthemselves  from  domestic  violence  (by  seeking  redress  and  protection),  and  from  sexually \ntransmitted diseases.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n1.  The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) will be the Executing \nAgency for the technical assistance (TA). MOWRAM will appoint a senior staff member from its \nDepartment of Hydrology and River Works to head the Project Management Office, which will \nadminister the TA and provide day-to-day guidance to the consultants. The project manager will \ndelegate representatives of the Provincial Department of Water Resources and Meteorology, \nProvincial Committee for Disaster Management (PCDM), and Provincial Development Council \nto oversee the consultants\u2019 operations on site. The TA consultants also will liaise closely with \nthe Cambodia National Mekong Committee to obtain relevant data from the Mekong River \nCommission (MRC), and to ensure that relevant findings of the TA are shared with MRC. In \nparticular, the TA consultants will exchange information with consultants engaged by MRC to \nimplement its flood management and mitigation program.  \n   \n2.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months. The project area will comprise the flood- \nand drought-affected districts of Kandal, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and Takeo provinces. During \nthe strategy development phase (initial 6 months), the TA consultants will operate from an office \nin Phnom Penh, with temporary offices in the project area when needed. The target area for the \nTA will be selected based of the findings of the strategy development phase, as described in the \nconsultants\u2019 phase 1 report. The target area will comprise a number of districts within one or two \nprovinces. During the capacity development phase (remaining 8 months), the TA consultants \nwill operate from a suitably located field office in the target area. \n \nB.  Overall Outcome \n3.  The main outcome of the TA will be the adoption by key stakeholders1 of improved \nparticipatory flood risk management for targeted vulnerable communities in the lower Mekong \nRiver basin provinces of Cambodia. To achieve this, the TA consultants will (i) help formulate a \ncommunity-based  risk-reduction  (CBRR)  strategy  comprising  common  standards  and \napproaches  (including  a  comprehensive  gender  strategy)  for  planning,  designing,  and \nimplementing preparedness, prevention, and mitigation measures; and (ii) develop skills of key \nagents  at  provincial,  district,  village,  and  community  levels,  including  staff  of  selected \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), by training in and applying the strategy in the target \narea. The CBRR strategy will reflect best practices, as well as lessons learned from ongoing \nand previous NGO interventions aimed at improving community disaster preparedness. As part \nof the training and demonstration processes, specific physical works, identified and designed by \nthe communities themselves under guidance of the TA consultants and contracted NGOs, will \nbe implemented by the communities.  \n \nC.  Strategy for Community-Based Risk Reduction \n4.  In many parts of Cambodia, natural disasters occur frequently, and cannot be dealt with \nas isolated events requiring ad hoc emergency responses. Therefore, the ability of local persons \nto prepare for natural disasters, prevent the most frequent events from causing serious harm, \nand  mitigate  extreme  impacts  to  within  acceptable  limits  are  the  most  effective  means  of \n                                                 \n1  Including (i) MOWRAM, PCDM, Provincial Department of Water Resources and Meteorology, and Provincial \nDevelopment  Councils;  (ii)  District  Committees  for  Disaster  Management  and  commune  councils;  (iii) \nnongovernment organizations; (iv) village development committees; and (v) vulnerable communities in the target \nareas. \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nmanaging risks and reducing people\u2019s vulnerability. CBRR measures can transform disaster-\naffected  persons  from  \u201cvictims\u201d  or  \u201cbeneficiaries  of  outside  aid\u201d  into  agents  for  building \ncommunity self-reliance and resilience.2 In this way, the reduction of vulnerability becomes part \nof the development process.  \n \n5.  The purposes of the CBRR strategy are to reduce vulnerability to disasters, minimize \nhuman suffering, hasten recovery, and introduce a new form of cooperation between support \nagencies and communities. The basic principles of the strategy are:  \n \n  (i)  Responsiveness. Interventions are to be based on the community\u2019s felt and \nurgent needs; \n  (ii)  Participation. Community members, particularly the most vulnerable groups, are \nto be involved in the whole process; \n  (iii)  Integration. Links are to be strengthened between the community, NGOs, and \ngovernment agencies at various levels;\n  (iv)  Comprehensiveness.  Interventions  are  to  include  structural  (physical)  and \nnonstructural measures (e.g., activities to improve public awareness, community \ncohesiveness,  environmental  protection,  health,  literacy,  and  livelihood \nopportunities); \n  (v)  Versatility.  Interventions  are  to  integrate  local  indigenous  knowledge  and \nresources  into  technological  solutions  and  other  support  from  outside  the \ncommunity; \n  (vi)  Empowerment.  Interventions  should  address  the  concerns  of  stakeholders, \nwhile upholding the interests of the most vulnerable groups, with the ultimate aim \nof giving communities more control over the natural and physical environments \naffecting their lives; and \n  (vii)  Development.  Interventions  are  to  be  conceived  as  part  of  a  long-term \ndevelopment process that seeks to reduce poverty, social inequity, exploitative \ngender relations, and environmental degradation. \n \n6.  Putting the strategy into action requires (i) capacity building and development of skills \nwithin relevant government agencies and NGOs to equip them with theoretical and practical \ntools to apply in community work; and (ii) engaging communities in CBRR through a step-by-\nstep process of team building, prioritization of needs, action planning, and implementation. \nTeam building depends on identifying natural leaders (progressive members), and using their \ninfluence to form village teams to serve as catalysts or prime movers in community mobilization. \nImportant adjuncts to this process are skills development and capacity building, situational \nanalysis  (recording  physical  characteristics,  demographic  features,  and  economic  and \nsociopolitical  aspects  of  the  community),  identification  of  groups  most  at  risk,  community \nanalysis of its priority needs and aspirations, community-generated solutions to problems, and \nagreement on roles and responsibilities of each member of the community for putting the \nsolution  into  place.  Village  teams  also  will  provide  the  necessary  interface  between  the \ncommunity  and  the  outside  agencies\u2014particularly  the  PCDM  and  District  Committees  for \nDisaster Management, other government officials, and NGOs. The teams also will be essential \nto sustaining the risk-reduction process.  \n \n                                                 \n2  CBRR can also complement government-implemented structural measures, which tend to pay little attention to the \nneeds  of  isolated  communities;  and,  in  some  cases,  might  increase  risk  by  altering  the  natural  (or  more \npredictable) way a disaster unfolds. \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \n7.  Under the TA, the level of participation and the quality of involvement in the CBRR \nprocess will be monitored and evaluated. This will be an essential means of measuring success, \nand adapting targets and plans if necessary. The TA consultants will propose quantitative and \nqualitative indicators for monitoring and evaluating participatory impact, with active involvement \nof one or more of the stakeholder groups. \n \nD.  Gender Strategy \n8.  The  TA  consultants  will  design  a  framework  for  conducting  gender  analyses  of \ncommunities in the target area, with the aim of determining (i) gender-based patterns of work \nallocation in productive and reproductive activities, including workload changes due to floods; (ii) \naccess to, and control over, productive resources; (iii) patterns of access to benefits from their \nlabor (wages, income and profits, savings), and control over the use of such benefits; (iv) \naccess to extension and training for improved productivity and incomes; (v) gender-based \nopportunities in decision-making, and representation at the household and community level; (vi) \ntraditional coping and self-reliance mechanisms of women and men during disasters; and (vii) \nneeds and priorities for women regarding access to emergency aid. The TA consultants will \nincorporate the gender strategy into the design of project activities, thereby improving the \nresponsiveness to the practical needs of women and men. Based on the gender analysis, \nspecific activities will be included to improve women\u2019s (i) access to productive resources made \navailable under the project, (ii) participation in decision-making, (iii) access to information, and \n(iv)  participation  in  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating \nachievement of the gender strategy will be developed.  \n \nE.  Reporting \n9.  The report on the effectiveness of NGO interventions will be submitted within 2 months \nof TA commencement. It will be based on an analysis of reports and other data from relevant \nprojects, as well as rapid appraisals of project sites in Kandal, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and \nTakeo  provinces.  The  phase  1  (strategy)  report  will  be  submitted  within  6  months  of \ncommencement. It will present a summary of studies, surveys, and investigations carried out \nduring the strategy development phase; simple geographic information system (GIS) showing \nimportant  physical  features;  and  relevant  vulnerability  characteristics  of  the  communities \n(demographic and socioeconomic data, flood and drought impacts, poverty, etc.). The phase 1 \nreport will describe (i) the goal and purpose of the strategy, with performance indicators; (ii) \ntargeting  procedures;  (iii)  menu  of  activities;  (iv)  community  participation  approach,  and \nproposed  tools;  (v)  gender  strategy;  (vi)  training  curriculum;  (vii)  monitoring  and  reporting \nframework; and (viii) proposed arrangements to ensure long-term support for disaster risk-\nreduction interventions for vulnerable communities in the project area. The report also will \ninclude recommended target areas, criteria for selecting NGO partners, proposed packaging of \nNGO contracts, draft invitation documents for selecting NGOs to implement activities during the \ncapacity development phase, draft contract for the baseline survey, and detailed implementation \narrangements for the NGO contracts. Two workshops will be conducted\u2014one during the study \nphase to develop a consensus for selecting target areas; and a second upon conclusion of the \nTA to confirm completion of activities, and to elicit stakeholder evaluation of their success. \n \nF.  Consulting Services Requirements \n10.  The  TA  will  require  four  international  consultants  for  20.5  person-months,  and  five \ndomestic consultants for 62.5 person-months.
