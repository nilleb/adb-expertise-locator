An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken.  The  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Board  along  with  the  environmental \nmanagement plan on 30 September 2005.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project is in Shandong Province, the northwestern part of \nwhich is in the Hai River Basin (HRB) that drains into Bohai Bay. \nThe  Project  is  one  of  the  planned  wastewater  management \nprojects under the national Hai River Basin Pollution Prevention \nand Control Plan. Shandong provincial government (SPG) issued \nits Shandong Hai River Basin (SHRB) Environmental Protection \nPlan in 2003. The proposed Project\u2019s areas have been prioritized \nfor implementation under the SHRB Plan. \n \nThe  Project  includes  nine  subprojects  grouped  into  four \ncomponents:  (i)  institutional  development,  (ii)  municipal \nwastewater management (MWM), (iii) solid waste management \n(SWM), and (iv) industrial wastewater management (IWM). The \nproposed  Project  will  be  implemented  in  secondary  cities  and \ncounties  in  four  municipalities:  Binzhou,  Dezhou,  Jinan,  and \nLiaocheng. \n   \nRationale  With  the  lack  of  environmental  infrastructure,  particularly  in \nsecondary cities and counties, and inadequate management of \nthe  wastewater  and  solid  waste  services,  SPG  would  have \ndifficulty achieving the pollution control targets in the SHRB Plan. \nThe proposed Project will (i) support institutional changes and \nphysical  investments  to  reduce  the  high  levels  of  untreated \nwastewater, (ii) adopt cleaner technologies, (iii) promote water \nreuse  to  augment  water  resources,  and  (iv)  control  non-point \nsource of pollution through effective SWM. The Project is a major \nurban  infrastructure  initiative  under  Shandong\u2019s  Tenth  5-Year \nPlan.  \n \n ", "iv \n  The  Project  aims  to  address  the  key  sectoral  issues  and \nconstraints by (i) employing an integrated multisector approach to \nenvironmental  pollution  control  in  SHRB;  (ii)  supporting \ninstitutional aspects  related  to  effective  environmental  pollution \ncontrol  management  at  local  levels;  (iii)  addressing  water \nconservation  issues;  (iv)  enhancing  capacity  in  environmental \npollution  control  through  improved  management  of  municipal, \nindustrial  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  services;  and \n(v) development of sustainable wastewater treatment and SWM \ncompanies. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is to improve the urban environment and \npublic health in Shandong province by reducing pollution of the \nHRB from different sources. Major outcomes of the Project are to \n(i)  provide  improved  and  sustainable  wastewater  and  SWM \nservices, on economically and environmentally sound principles \nand practices, through establishment of appropriate wastewater \nand solid waste utility companies in the project cities/counties; and \n(ii) implement an integrated approach for the management and \ncontrol of solid waste, and municipal and industrial wastewater. In \neach project city/county, the service area will encompass most of \nthe urbanized area, maximizing potential downstream benefits of \nimproved  water  quality  through  point  and  non-point  source \npollution control. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The Project is estimated to cost $160.36 million equivalent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan       \nSource  Total  Percent \nADB Loan       80.00      49.90 \nGovernment \n     80.36       50.10  \n     \n  Total     160.36 100.00  \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nADB will provide a loan of $80 million equivalent to finance 49.9% \nof the cost of the Project. County/city/municipal finance bureaus, \nand self-financing by the implementing agencies (IA), will cover \nthe remaining financing requirements. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB will provide a loan of $80 million from its ordinary capital \nresources under its London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  and  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per year, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n   \n ", "v \nAllocation and Relending  The Borrower will be the PRC, which will relend to SPG on the \nTerms  same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. SPG will \nonlend to municipal governments, which will onlend to city and \ncounty  governments.  The  city/county  governments  then  will \nonlend to the IAs. All relending and onlending arrangements for \nMWM  and  SWM  subprojects  will  be  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as the ADB loan. For IWM subprojects, a repayment \nperiod of 12 years including grace period of 4 years will apply. \nSPG will charge a service fee of 0.2% on the MWM and SWM \ncomponents, and 0.5% on the IWM component, as part of the \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement.  The  IAs  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  SPG  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  implementation  of  the \nArrangements  Project. A project leading group headed by Shandong Province\u2019 \nvice governor, and a Shandong provincial project management \noffice (SPMO) headed by the deputy director general of Shandong \nProvincial  Construction  Bureau,  have  been  established.  The \nSPMO includes members from the Shandong Provincial Finance \nBureau,  Shandong  Provincial  Development  and  Reform \nCommission, and Shandong Provincial Environmental Protection \nBureau.  The  SPMO  will  oversee  project  implementation  and \ncoordinate the work of the nine IAs and local governments.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Shandong Provincial Government  \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and in accordance with \nthe  PRC\u2019s  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  procurement \nregulations. Civil works valued at less than $10 million equivalent \nwill  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) \nprocedures,  in  accordance  with  government  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Foreign contractors may participate in the \nbidding for NCB contracts, in accordance with ADB requirements. \nEquipment and materials estimated at $1 million or more will be \nprocured using international competitive bidding procedures, and \nthose  valued  at  less  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  through \nlimited  international  bidding  and/or  NCB.  Goods  valued  up  to \n$100,000 will be procured through shopping. \n   \nConsulting Services  SPG will select and engage an international consulting firm in \nassociation with domestic consultants, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe  consulting  firm  will  assist  the  SPMO,  local  project \nmanagement  offices,  and  the  IAs  in project implementation and \n ", "vi \n  management,  and  capacity  building  under  the  Project.  The \ninternational consulting firm will be recruited using ADB\u2019s quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method.  The  Project  will  provide  51 \nperson-months  of  international  and  168  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services, covering (i) project management, \npredesign pilot studies, and implementation support; (ii) review of \ndetailed design, and assistance with tender documentation and \nbid  evaluation;  (iii)  construction  management  and  efficient \noperating procedures; (iv) organization and operations structuring; \n(v)  development  of  financial  management  and  accounting, \nmanagement information system, and human resource systems; \n(vi)  corporate  strategic  planning,  including  private  sector \nparticipation  (PSP);  and  (vii)  social  impact  and  environmental \nmonitoring. Least cost selection and/or consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection  will  be  used  for  clean  development  mechanism \nimplementation and marketing. \n   \nProject  Benefits  and  The Project will benefit more than 3.9 million people in the project \nBeneficiaries  areas,  including  2.2  million  in  the  direct  project  area  and  1.7 \nmillion in the indirect project area. The Project will contribute to \npollution control in the HRB, particularly in the Tuhai\u2013Majia River \nsystem.  The  multisector  and  multimedia  approach  to  pollution \nprevention in the HRB will provide the most sustainable prospects \nfor  (i) reducing  waterborne  pollution,  (ii)  achieving  the  surface \nwater quality targets, and (iii) improving the living conditions in the \nproject areas. \n \nImplementation of the institutional development component will \nfollow an agreed road map, which aims to establish SWM and \nMWM companies that are managerially autonomous, operationally \nefficient, and financially self-sustainable. This goal, especially in \nthe  financial  area,  is  a  pioneering  attempt  in  the  local  areas \nconcerned,  as  well  as  for  SWM  in  general  in  the  PRC.  The \ngradual changes proposed under the Project are in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term strategy to (i) reduce direct Government \ninvolvement in waste operations and management, (ii) expand \nservice coverage, and (iii) improve operational efficiencies. \n   \nBy improving environmental and sanitary conditions in the project \nareas, the Project is expected to reduce the incidence of water- \nand vector-related diseases, and improve living conditions of the \npopulation.  Health  benefit  estimates  for  2009\u20132024  show \nsignificant cost savings accruing to project beneficiaries. \n     \n ", "vii \n  Of the beneficiary population, 6.5% live below the local poverty \nline. The poverty and social analysis shows that the Project will \ncontribute to (i) improved wastewater and solid waste facilities and \nservices; (ii) reduced air, surface, and groundwater pollution; (iii) \nreduced  risks  of  exposure  to  disease  vectors;  (iv)  increased \nemployment  opportunities  and  income-generating  activities;  (v) \nreduced risks of people falling into poverty due to closure of paper \nmills; and (vi) improved urban living environment and quality of \nlife. An affordability analysis was undertaken of two representative \nhousehold groups: the average-income group and the low-income \ngroup. The proposed tariffs will be set at levels that are affordable \nfor  both  groups,  with  the  monthly  water  and  wastewater  bill \naccounting for 2.5% of the income of average family and 4.0% of \nthat of the low-income households. The solid waste disposal bill \nwill account for 0.4% of the income of the average family and 1% \nof that of the low-income family. For the poorest households, the \ncity/county  governments  provide  a  minimum  living  standard \nscheme, which includes a provision for lifeline utility services. The \ncounty  and  city  governments  also  provide  a  rebate  on \nwater/wastewater  bills  to  all  households  qualifying  for  social \nassistance  with  the  recent  increase  in  water  and  wastewater \ntariffs. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Potential  project  risks  involve  mainly  institutional  and  financial \nfactors: (i) inadequate political support for institutional reform in \nSWM  and  MWM  sectors,  corporatization,  PSP  and  integration \nprocess;  unfamiliarity  with  performance-driven  commercial \noperations; and lack of staffing; (ii) resistance to required tariff-\nsetting  and  collection  mechanisms;  and  (iii)  low  user  fee \ncollections  that  could  threaten  financial  sustainability. \nComprehensive institutional development and training programs \nwill be implemented in coordination with relevant departments to \nensure support for the proper restructuring of SWM sector, and \nimplementation of the agreed road map. The detailed tariff-setting \nand collection mechanisms and procedures will be developed in a \nparticipatory  way,  with  a  view  to  strengthening  the  regulatory \nfunctions  of  the  local  authorities.  Other  potential  risks  include \nweak  enforcement  of  separate  collection  of  hazardous  and \nmunicipal wastes, and pretreatment of industrial wastewater. The \nProject will address these risks by developing detailed guidelines \nfor collection and reporting procedures, including (i) handling of \nhazardous waste; (ii) training for waste collectors to avoid mixed \ncollection; (iii) spot checks and surveys around the landfill sites; \nand (iv) close collaboration with, and information-sharing among, \nlocal environmental protection bureaus. \n \n

" \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shandong Hai River Basin Pollution Control Project \n(the Project). \n \n2.  The proposed Project is in Shandong Province, the northwestern part of which is in the Hai \nRiver Basin (HRB), which drains into Bohai Bay through nine tributaries.1 The Project is one of the \nplanned wastewater management projects under the national Hai River Basin Pollution Prevention \nand  Control  Plan  (HRB  Plan),  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).2 Shandong \nprovincial government (SPG) issued its Shandong HRB (SHRB) Environmental Protection Plan in \n2003. The proposed Project\u2019s areas have been prioritized for implementation under the SHRB Plan. \nThe project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  The pace of environmental pollution in the PRC has been increasing rapidly in step with the \ncountry\u2019s swift economic growth over the past decade. Surface water and groundwater in particular \nhave been affected, with water quality worsening in the major river basins of the PRC. Of the \ncountry\u2019s seven major river basins, 52% of water bodies do not meet class III national quality \nstandards.3 \n \n4.  Increasing discharge of untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial wastewater is \na direct and major cause of river pollution. Due to rapid economic growth, industrial wastewater \ncomprises more than 70% of total wastewater generated in some cities. For example, the output \nfrom the paper industry, which is an important economic activity in Shandong and many other \nprovinces,4 has grown more than tenfold in the past 2 decades. The industry is associated with \nsignificant environmental pollution.  \n \n5.  In 2003, the PRC generated about 550 million tons of municipal solid waste. Approximately \n85% of it was disposed of in simple landfills or open dumps that do not meet acceptable sanitary \nrequirements. In addition to direct adverse impacts on public health, the growing and uncontrolled \ndisposal of solid waste contributes to increasing contamination of groundwater supplies through \ninadequate leachate collection systems.5 \n \n6.  In its Tenth 5-year Plan (T5YP) (2001\u20132005), the Government focused on pollution control \nplans for the key river basins, including the HRB. This basin, which is about 265,000 square \n                                                 \n1  Shandong Province also includes parts of Huai River Basin and Yellow River Basin. \n2  ADB. 1998.

Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for \nHenan Wastewater Management and Water Supply Sector Project. Manila (Loan 2207-PRC).  \n3  The PRC has five water quality standards, with class I designated for drinking water resources and nationally protected \nbodies of water, and class V only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum quality for municipal water supply. \n4  Shandong Province produces almost 15% of the national production of paper. \n5  Leachate is liquid percolated from solid waste landfills or dumps; it can contain undesirable or toxic chemicals. \n ", "2      \nkilometers (km2), includes Shandong Province in the south and southeast.6 More than 117 million \npeople live in the HRB, which includes a number of megacities. The basin is one of the PRC's most \nimportant industrial regions, accounting for 15% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).   \n \n7.  A severe water crisis in the densely populated HRB, especially in its southeastern areas, \nhas resulted from a combination of (i) fast economic growth; (ii) overexploitation of surface and \ngroundwater for domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses; and (iii) lack of adequate wastewater \nand solid waste treatment facilities. This situation has affected people\u2019s lives and health seriously, \nand constrained local socioeconomic development and productivity. Major urban areas, including \nseveral megacities, have only partial wastewater treatment. More than 80% of the surface water \nand 50% of the groundwater are classified as polluted sources of raw water.  \n \n8.  Shandong Province comprises 17 municipalities and 139 counties, districts, and cities, \nspread over 156,700 km2 with a population of 91.82 million. Shandong Province borders Hebei \nProvince to the north, and faces Bohai Bay and the Yellow Sea to the east. Since 1990, provincial \nGDP has grown at more than 10% per year on average. Shandong accounted for about 11% of the \nnational GDP in 2004.  \n \n9.  The northwestern part of Shandong Province\u2014the HRB portion\u2014covers approximately \n26,000 km2 and includes four municipalities (Binzhou, Dezhou, Jinan, and Liaocheng) with 26 \ncounties and a population of 15.5 million. As in other parts of the HRB, groundwater overdraft and \npollution are threatening the sustainable use of aquifers in Shandong. Monitoring records from 180 \nwater quality control sections in the SHRB show that most sections monitored are class V or worse, \nwith a few sections rated class IV. Only one third of urban wastewater is being treated, and the rate \nof wastewater treatment and reuse is significantly lower. Solid waste infrastructure and sanitation \nservices are deficient in most cities and counties in Shandong, putting public health at risk. \n \n10.  SHRB  consists  of  two  river  systems,  the  Zhang\u2013Wei-Nan  and  the  Tuhai\u2013Majia.  The \nproposed project areas are mainly in the Tuhai\u2013Majia system, and include the Dehuixin, Majia, and \nTuhai tributaries. Most sections in these rivers and tributaries are classified as worse than class V.  \n \n11.  SPG recognizes the need to address environmental pollution. Investments in environmental \ninfrastructure (water supply and sanitation, water conservation, and environmental management) in \nShandong Province reportedly totaled about $3.2 billion over the past 4 years, which is equivalent \nto 2.6% of provincial GDP. Wastewater charges are being increased gradually to cover the full cost \nplus a reasonable profit margin to provide commercial incentives to invest in wastewater treatment \nfacilities. However, to enhance the quality of urban life and ensure a sustainable foundation for \neconomic growth in the entire SHRB, more investment and institutional reforms are required to \naddress wastewater and solid waste pollution control.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n12.  Key problems and opportunities include (i) groundwater and surface water pollution in the \nSHRB, (ii) scarcity of good quality water resources, (iii) inadequate wastewater treatment capacity, \n(iv) lack of integrated management for industrial and municipal wastewaters, (v) inadequate solid \nwaste management (SWM) facilities and services, (vi) need to enhance efficiency of industries \nthrough adoption of clean production technologies, and (vii) need to build operational efficiencies \nand managerial capacities of the utilities. \n \n13.  The HRB Plan. The Government recognizes that adequate environmental protection and \npollution control are prerequisites for sustainable economic growth. The HRB has been identified \n                                                 \n6  The HRB also includes the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi, and the \nmunicipalities of Beijing and Tianjin.  \n ", "       3\nas one of three river basins and three lake basins in the PRC with the highest priority for improving \nwater quality. The HRB Plan, an action program under the PRC\u2019s Green Plan,7 sets pollution \ncontrol targets for 2000 and 2010. The key parameters used for water quality planning are annual \nchemical oxygen demand (COD)8 and ammonia nitrogen loads.  \n \n14.  The  Ministry  of  Construction,  through  the  provincial  and  municipal  construction \ncommissions,  is  responsible  for  overseeing  urban  plans  for  major  cities,  including  plans  and \ninvestments  for  urban  wastewater  treatment  and  water  resources  protection.  The  State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, through its policies and programs, plays an important role \nin the development of sound environmental practices in the PRC water sector.  \n \n15.  The T5YP and ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program9 for the PRC prioritize investments for \nimproving  environmental  management,  water  conservation,  and  reducing  water  pollution.  The \nGovernment plans to (i) increase centralized urban wastewater treatment during the T5YP by 26 \nmillion cubic meters (m3), (ii) raise the treatment rate of municipal wastewater from 34% to 45%, \nand (iii) increase the use of recycled water by industries from 50% in 2000 to 60% in 2005.  \nEnvironmental protection continues to be important focus of the Government in the 11th 5-Year \nPlan (2006\u20132010). \n \n16.  The  SHRB  Plan  sets  the  standards  for  pollutant  discharges  from  water  sub-basins, \nincluding those from solid waste. Under this plan, all municipalities and counties are required to \ntake the following actions on pollution control: (i) surface waters supplying raw water for urban use \nare required to meet class III; (ii) water quality in the main rivers and canals needs to improve \nbefore 2006, with target reductions in pollutant discharges of COD;10 (iii) 45% of urban wastewater \nmust  receive  secondary  treatment;  (iv)  paper  mills  are  required  to  meet  industrial  discharge \nstandards;11 and (v) solid waste pollution must be controlled, while construction of SWM facilities is \naccelerated. \n \n17.  Project Rationale. With the lack of environmental infrastructure, particularly in secondary \ncities and counties, and inadequate management of the wastewater and solid waste services, SPG \nwould have difficulty achieving the pollution control targets in the SHRB Plan. The Project will (i) \nsupport institutional changes and physical investments to reduce the high levels of untreated \nwastewater; (ii) adopt cleaner technologies, and promote water reuse to augment water resources; \nand (iii) control non-point source of pollution through effective SWM. The Project is a major urban \ninfrastructure initiative under Shandong\u2019s T5YP.  \n \n18.  Addressing urban environmental problems and water resources protection is a high priority \nin ADB\u2019s  Country Strategy and Program for the PRC. The Project builds on experience gained and \nlessons learned from ADB\u2019s past and current activities in the wastewater sector and environmental \nimprovement initiatives in the HRB (footnote 2 and paras. 25\u201327).  \n \n19.  The Project aims to address the key sectoral issues and constraints by (i) employing an \nintegrated  multisector  approach  to  environmental  pollution  control  in  SHRB;  (ii)  supporting \ninstitutional reforms related to effective environmental pollution control management at local levels; \n                                                 \n7  The Green Plan was a key element in the Government\u2019s Ninth 5-Year Plan (1996\u20132000). \n8  COD, a measure of water quality, indicates the quantity of oxygen required in biological and non-biological oxidation of \nmaterials in water. The T5YP has set quantitative reduction targets for the COD and ammonia nitrogen in 2005, which \nare 26% and 22% from the 2000 levels, respectively. \n9   ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n10  COD discharges into rivers are required to be reduced to 69,300 tons per year, and ammonia nitrogen pollutant \ndischarges to 12,700 tons per year. \n11  They must reach 300 milligrams per liter (mg/l) COD in 2007 and 120 mg/l in 2010. \n ", "4      \n(iii)  addressing  water  conservation  issues;  (iv)  enhancing  capacity  in  environmental  pollution \ncontrol  through  improved  management  of  municipal,  industrial  wastewater,  and  solid  waste \nservices;  (v)  developing  sustainable  wastewater  treatment  and  SWM  companies;  and  (vi) \nevaluating realistic  options for  potential  private  sector  participation  (PSP). The use of previous \ninvestments in wastewater collection and treatment facilities will be optimized.12 The Project, which \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy,13 will  help  the  Government  to  achieve  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals of environmental sustainability and increased access to improved sanitation. \n \n20.  Policy Dialogue. In line with broader ADB\u2013Government policy dialogue, extensive project \npolicy dialogue focused on (i) developing an integrated approach to all urban waste sources, \nincluding municipal and industrial wastewater and municipal solid waste; (ii) developing integrated \nmanagement  of  the  chain  from  collection  to  treatment  to  reuse  for  municipal  wastewater \nmanagement (MWM) and SWM; (iii) controlling industrial pollution through utilization of clean \nproduction  technologies  and  resource  recovery;  (iv)  corporatizing  MWM  and  SWM,  and \ncommercialization  reforms;14 (v)  developing  appropriate  PSP  strategies  for  MWM,  SWM,  and \nindustrial enterprises; (vi) achieving full cost recovery, and tariff and regulatory reforms; and (vii) \nusing the clean development mechanism (CDM) to provide environmental benefits and financial \nleverage to SWM for efficient extraction and utilization of landfill gas (LFG). SPG and ADB agreed \non these goals for MWM and SWM operational efficiency and sustainability. In addition, they \nrecognized the need for gradual changes in institutional and local government structures, and the \nneed to ensure full participation of all stakeholders.  \n \n21.  While national Government\u2019s policies propound market-oriented reform for utility services, \nthe absence of detailed guidelines has led to slow implementation of reforms at lower government \nlevels. Thus, policy discussions with SPG and local project management offices (LPMO) focused \non achieving (i) managerially independent and financially sustainable utility companies, (ii) reforms \nin tariff-setting and collection mechanisms, (iii) separate regulatory and monitoring functions, and \n(iv) PSP potential.   \n \n22.  PSP policy discussions focused on the appropriate objectives and pace of reforms for the \nProject\u2019s implementing agencies (IA). Talks also addressed the development of appropriate sector \nand institutional capacities for MWM and SWM subprojects to achieve equal opportunities for all \nPSP stakeholders. As such, the project design catalyzes a PSP enabling environment through its \ninstitutional development program; and incorporates measures for introducing PSP to the Project\u2019s \nIAs, including the paper mills (Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n23.  The potential use of CDM for the SWM component was discussed extensively (Section III C \nand Appendix 3). The use of CDM will encourage foreign private sector involvement. Further, it will \nprovide financial incentives to the IAs to enhance (i) waste collection, (ii) storm water drainage and \nleachate treatment, (iii) LFG extraction and treatment, and (iv) methane utilization (approximately \n50% of LFG is methane, a valuable energy source). \n \n24.   Other policy issues discussed included (i) enforcement of local regulations to meet effluent \ndischarge standards, (ii) proper closure of landfills and waste storage lagoons, and (iii) the need for \n                                                 \n12  Many of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the PRC are not operating at full capacity. A recent study by \nShandong Provincial Construction Bureau found that about 56% of the treatment plants in Shandong Province are \noperating below their respective design capacities. One stated reason is a slow pace of transition of WWTPs into self-\nsustaining enterprises. \n13  ADB 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank.

Lessons Learned. The People\u2019s Republic of China Resident Mission recently undertook a \nperformance portfolio review of the water supply, sanitation, and waste management sector. This \nprocess  identified  successes  and  deficiencies,  as  well  as  lessons  learned,  from  portfolio \nperformance.16 Major issues identified included (i) delays in the startup of projects and in the \nprocurement process, (ii) institutional arrangements for project implementation and sustainable \noperations, and (iii) loan savings accompanied by cancellation of surplus loan amounts. These \nissues were reviewed and the lessons learned were incorporated in the project design. \n \n26.  Lessons learned from previous ADB projects in relevant sectors, as well as from two \nongoing World Bank projects implemented by SPG, have been taken into consideration. These \nincluded: (i) timely completion of the projects was achieved because of the strong commitment of \nthe  municipal/provincial governments in making the project facilities operational as quickly as \npossible; (ii) support from local governments and consumers for tariff adjustments contributed to \nproject sustainability; (iii) disbursements under the ADB loan and domestic onlending procedures, \nneed to be synchronized better; (iv) all parties concerned must take ownership of the projects, and \nclose coordination between the provincial/local governments and the utility companies is needed; \n(v)  utility  companies  need  to  be  encouraged  to  commercialize  their  operations;  (vi)  local \ngovernment\u2019s regulatory role in the urban infrastructure sector needs to improve; and (vii) more \npractical  methodologies  for  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  need  to  be \nestablished during project design and implementation.   \n \n27.  The  build-operate-transfer  arrangements  for  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTP)  in \nShandong Province were reviewed. Notably, in the absence of strong regulatory capacity at the \nlocal levels, the arrangements are linked to external factors (such as the term cycles of the local \nofficials) and they do not result in fair financial and contractual arrangements. These lessons \nlearned, reflected in Supplementary Appendix B, have been considered in designing the Project.  \n \n28.  External Assistance. Since 1993, ADB has provided 14 loans totaling about $1.4 billion for \nurban  environmental  improvement  and  pollution  control,  urban  water  supply,  and  wastewater \nmanagement (Appendix 4).17 Specifically, two loans in the HRB\u2014in Hebei Province and Tianjin \nmunicipality\u2014support pollution control and water quality improvement in the basin. ADB also has \nprovided more than 42 technical assistance (TA) grants for about $30 million to prepare these \nprojects, as well as to study key issues in water resources and pollution control, water supply, \nMWM, and SWM. ADB\u2019s assistance has contributed to (i) rational pricing of water and wastewater; \n(ii)  implementation  of  commercialization  in  utility  operations;  (iii)  improved  environmental \nmanagement, including SWM; (iv) formulation of effluent standards and development of regulatory \naspects; and (iv) introduction of PSP.18 \n \n29.  The World Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and many bilateral \naid agencies also have provided financial and technical assistance to the PRC in the urban \n                                                 \n15  Local governments provide social assistance or minimum living guarantee levels for households with incomes below \nthe poverty line and for vulnerable groups of population to protect them from increases in waste-related tariffs and \nfees. \n16  ADB. 2005.

Subsequently, \nADB provided a $26.5 million loan and a complementary loan of $21.5 million to finance the project. ADB also has \nprovided TA to strengthen policy reform on the use of market-based instruments in enhancing PSP in public utilities.

World Bank has provided financial assistance \nfor 26 urban environmental improvement projects. JBIC is the largest bilateral source of aid to the \nPRC. Germany, through the German Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau is supporting SWM and MWM \nprojects. Other bilateral agencies from Australia, Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, United \nKingdom, and United States also support environmental management projects on a smaller scale \nthan multilateral development agencies. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n30.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  public  health  in \nShandong Province by reducing pollution of the HRB from different sources. The Project involves (i) \nimproving municipal wastewater collection, treatment, and reuse; (ii) providing municipal solid \nwaste  collection  and  disposal;  (iii)  adopting  clean  industrial  processes  and  improving  waste \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  supporting  the  institutional  development  of  utilities.  One  of  the  major \noutcomes  of  the  Project  is  improved  and  sustainable  wastewater  and  SWM  services  on \neconomically  and  environmentally  sound  principles  and  practices.  Another  outcome  is  the \nimplementation of an integrated approach for the management of municipal wastewater and solid \nwaste  point  and  non-point  pollution  sources.  The  proposed  Project  will  be  implemented  in \nsecondary cities and counties within four municipalities: Binzhou, Dezhou, Jinan, and Liaocheng.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n31.  The proposed Project has nine subprojects grouped into four components: (i) institutional \ndevelopment; (ii) MWM; (iii) SWM; and (iv) industrial wastewater management (IWM).  \n \n32.  Institutional  Development.  This  component  aims  to  develop  financially  sustainable, \noperationally  efficient,  and  managerially  autonomous  utility  companies  in  MWM  and  SWM \nsubprojects. These utilities would effectively manage project-created assets for efficient service \ndelivery. The institutions responsible for implementing the four MWM and three SWM subprojects \nare at an early stage of development and need assistance in streamlining their processes. \n \n33.  The Shandong Project Management Office (SPMO), LPMOs, and IAs have agreed on a \nroad map for institutional development under the Project, which includes a series of gradual steps \nfor achieving the component\u2019s objectives. Utility companies for each of the four MWM and three \nSWM  subprojects  will  be  established  and  registered  before  loan  negotiations.  Institutional \nconsultants will work with the LPMOs and IAs to develop and implement the road map during loan \nimplementation (Appendix 2).   \n \n34.  Municipal Wastewater Management. This component has four subprojects in:  \n \n(i)  Binzhou  City  (Economic  Development  Zone),  which  includes  40,000  ton  per  day  (t/d) \ncapacity WWTP, 30,000 t/d reuse water treatment plant, approximately 65 kilometers (km) \nof sewer and 17 km of reuse water piping, and 30,000 t/d lift station; \n(ii)  Gaotang County, which includes 40,000 t/d WWTP (phase II), 40,000 t/d reuse water \ntreatment plant, 23 km of sewer, trunk sewer, and reuse water piping;  \n(iii)  Linqing City, which includes 100,000 t/d WWTP, 50,000 t/d reuse water treatment plant, 12 \nkm of trunk sewer, reuse water piping, and treatment effluent discharge lines;19 and  \n(iv)  Shanghe County, which includes 40,000 t/d WWTP, 21 km of sewer, and two lift stations, \nwith a 10,000 t/d and 30,000 t/d capacity, respectively. \n \n                                                 \n19  This subproject also plays an important role in the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. \n ", "       7\n35.  The MWM component will reduce the pollutants discharged into HRB immediately upon \ncommissioning of the WWTPs (the average COD removal rate is 75%). With other HRB pollution \ncontrol measures long-term improvements are expected. This component will eliminate a source of \npollution to the local groundwater, and promote reuse treated wastewater to reduce the demand for \nwater resources. \n \n36.  Solid Waste Management. This component includes three subprojects, each with a new \nlined sanitary landfill with leachate collection and treatment systems, and associated equipment. \nThe subprojects are in (i) Linyi County, with a landfill with 200 t/d, 20-year capacity; (ii) Linqing City, \nwith 400 t/d, 15-year capacity; and (iii) Zouping County, with 400 t/d, 15-year capacity. \n \n37.  Currently, the typical solid waste landfill in the project areas is an unlined open dump, \nwhere industrial and municipal waste is dumped without control or daily cover. This generates \nleachate, as well as odors and pests, which pose significant threats to the local groundwater, \nnearby  residents,  and  the  environment.  Upon  completion,  this  component  will  improve  local \nresidents\u2019 quality of life and eliminate a major source of pollution in the future. Pollution reduction to \nHRB will be indirect, but with long-term effects. \n \n38.  Industrial Wastewater Management. This component includes two paper mill subprojects: \n \n(i)  Changyuan Paper Mill, including 1,800 m3/day black liquor20 recovery system with 200 t/d \nof solid capacity, 43 t/d sodium hydroxide recovery, 45,000 m3/day middle-wastewater \ntreatment, 15,000 m3/day white liquor recycling system, and associated structures; and \n(ii)  Quanlin Paper Mill, including 11,470 m3/day black liquor recovery system with 2,440 t/d of \nsolid capacity, 536 t/d sodium hydroxide and 485 t/d lime recovery systems.  \n \n39.  Paper and pulp production is a major industry in the local economy (Quanlin Paper Mill \nemploys 11,000 people). The current technological processes produce \u201cblack liquor\u201d, and the \ntreatment  processes  add  high  concentrations  of  unregulated  salts  to  the  effluent,  creating  a \ncontinuous source of surface and groundwater contamination. Under the PRC\u2019s pollution control \npolicy, the paper mills are required to comply with more stringent discharge standards by 2007. \nThe mills that do not comply would be shut down, with major socioeconomic implications for the \nlocal  economies  and  livelihood  of  the  population.21 An  effective  alkali22 recovery  and  middle-\nwastewater treatment system significantly reduces regulated pollutants (300,000 t/y of COD and \n(200,000  t/y  of  inorganic  salts)  discharged  into  HRB,  improves  resource  recovery  (alkali  and \nenergy  in  steams),  and  eliminates  a  source  of  groundwater  pollution.  Investments  under  the \nProject  will  not  enhance  productive  capacity  of  the  paper  companies.  In  recognition  of  the \ncommercial nature of the IAs for IWM, the onlending arrangement for IWM will have shorter grace \nand repayment periods of 4 years and 8 years, respectively.23 \n \n40.  The  proposed  investments  were  determined  based  on  (i)  feasibility  studies  for  each \nsubproject, prepared by qualified domestic design institutes, after analysis of technical options for \n                                                 \n20  Black liquor is a by-product of paper production, containing inorganic chemicals and large amounts of organic \nsubstances. White liquor is the wastewater from making paper, which contains bleached (white) fibers that could be \nrecovered for paper making. \n21 The livelihoods of many people associated with the paper mill\u2019s operations, including employees and their dependents, \nfarmers supplying wheat straw, wholesalers, and retailers, would be affected. \n22 Alkali is a general term for all basic chemicals that are not acid. \n23 ADB\u2019s Private Sector Policy recognizes that \u201cwhen properly regulated and operating under competitive market \nconditions, the private sector can generally use resources more efficiently than the public sector.\u201d However, ADB \ninvolvement  in  funding  the  subproject  is  justified  on  three  grounds:  (i)  in  compliance  with  regulations,  and  \nenvironmental pollution control measures in addressing the existing externality; (ii) local socioeconomic considerations; \nand (iii) as a catalyst in improving the potential of the enterprise to attract the private sector subsequent to its \nenvironmental upgrade. \n ", "8      \ntechnology, capacity, and location to determine least-cost solutions; (ii) review and analysis of \nfeasibility studies by international consultants; and (iii) review by ADB. The project design is \nconsidered technically sound and draws on best engineering practices (Appendix 5). \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n41.  The Project adopts a multisectoral approach to environmental pollution control, as well as \nintegrated management of the chain from collection and treatment to reuse for MWM, SWM, and \nIWM (paras. 19\u201320). Special features are described below (paras. 42\u201348). \n \n42.  Use of Reclaimed Wastewater. This is a new frontier in the PRC. In Shandong Province \nthe scarcity of water resources is inhibiting economic growth and undermining residents\u2019 quality of \nlife. The Project provides wastewater reclamation in three cities/counties and promotes industrial \nuse of the reclaimed water, conserving good quality water for drinking or other domestic uses. \n \n43.   Pioneering  Institutional  Arrangements  for  SWM. The PRC has made considerable \nprogress in MWM reforms, though SWM institutional reform is still at an early stage. Only a few \ncities, such as Hangzhou and Chongqing, have started SWM corporatization reform. The creation \nof  landfills  alone  will  not  address  sustainability  issues,  and  a  focus  on  management  and \noperational efficiencies is needed. Under the Project, transparent and efficient tariff-setting and \ncollection mechanisms will be implemented. Corporatization will establish three state-owned SWM \ncompanies with autonomous management, operations, and financial systems. These changes will \nfacilitate (i) the reflection of the true cost of all SWM services in tariffs; (ii) financial sustainability; (ii) \nPSP; and (iv) innovative processes, such as waste-to-energy (para. 44). \n \n44.  Carbon Emission Credits for SWM. During project preparation, the potential for using \nCDM for SWM subprojects was considered. CDM, created as one of three market mechanisms to \nmitigate  global  climate  change  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  of  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, is intended as a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution to reducing global greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions and promoting sustainable development (Appendix 3).  \n \n45.  Based on preliminary data and under a conservative scenario, the three SWM subprojects \nhave the potential to reduce 1.2 million\u20131.6 million tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO e) during \n2\nthe first 10 years of the Project.24 The financial value of these emission reductions (ER) would \nrange from $8 million to $16 million, assuming a price of $6.5\u2013$10 per tCO e.25 ERs will be \n2\nachieved by reducing the venting into the atmosphere of methane, a highly potent GHG that \ncomprises approximately 50% of LFG; and displacement of more carbon-intensive fuels, such as \ncoal used in boilers. The potential financial incentive from the application of the CDM to the SWM \ncomponent will (i) promote significant improvement in solid waste collection and management \nefficiency, (ii) address technological barriers to efficient extraction and utilization of LFG, and (iii) \nalleviate financial burdens for the use of LFG as fuel.  \n \n46.  To  maximize  the  future  financial  benefits  of  the  CDM,  sufficient  budget  to  enhance \nefficiency  of  LFG  collection,  utilization,  and  destruction  has  been  allocated  for  the  SWM \nsubprojects. At the request of the SPMO and SWM IAs, ADB conducted further technical, financial, \nand institutional due diligence on the subject. The CDM feature of the SWM component was \nconfirmed at appraisal. The SPMO will act as the representative for the SWM subprojects in \nnegotiating with potential buyers of carbon credits resulting from the application of CDM. To \nenhance the value of the Project to carbon credit buyers and achieve better contract terms for the \n                                                 \n24 Once emission reductions (ER) are verified by a third party and registered with the CDM executive board, they are \ncalled certified emission reductions. ERs and certified emission reductions often are referred to as \u201ccarbon credits\u201d. \n25 Financial value might be much higher, with European Union emission allowance prices ranging near \u20ac20 per tCO e \n2\nsince the Kyoto Protocol took effect in February 2005. \n ", "       9\nIAs,  ADB\u2019s  CDM  facility  will  provide  comprehensive  support  to  the  Project  to  develop  CDM \ndocumentation and conduct capacity-building seminars before loan effectiveness. This support will \nfocus on the design and operation of landfills with enhanced LFG recovery, and utilization and \nimprovement in SWM management efficiency. \n \n47.  Adoption of Clean Technology for Paper Mills. Under the IWM component, the Project \nwill modernize the processes of the two paper mills to incorporate cleaner technology. Aside from \nthe direct reduction of conventional pollutants, such as COD, biochemical oxygen demand, and \nammonia, in their WWTPs, the Project will (i) facilitate the reuse of steam energy and cooking \nchemicals, (ii) conserve chemicals that otherwise would be consumed for wastewater treatment, \nand (iii) prevent a large amount of unregulated salts from entering the HRB.  \n \n48.  Potential for PSP. The institutional development component incorporates realistic PSP \nstrategies for the smaller cities/counties, including measures to assess PSP options relevant for \neach IA. PSP options include operations and management (O&M) contracts, joint ventures, and \nothers as applicable. PSP action plans for most IAs will be completed within 2 years from loan \neffectiveness, with implementation to start following agreement with SPG and ADB (Appendix 2 \nand Supplementary Appendix A). For the IWM (paper mills) and Binzhou MWM subprojects, PSP \nplans will be developed within 18 months and implementation will begin by the third year. The \nformulation of specific PSP strategies for each MWM, SWM, and IWM IAs can be models for future \nutility reforms in the PRC. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n49.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility and a commitment charge of 0.75% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n51.  The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nassurance  that  the  Government  made  these  choices  independently  and  did  not  rely  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.   \n \n52.  The ADB loan will cover about 49.9% of project cost (or 76.1% of the foreign exchange cost \nand 0.3% of the local currency cost). The Borrower will be the PRC, which will relend to SPG on \nthe  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  SPG  will  onlend  to  municipal \ngovernments, which will onlend to city and county governments. The city and county governments \nthen  will  onlend  to  the  IAs.  SPG  will  retain  $1.5  million  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  capacity \nbuilding/training programs under the Project.26 All relending and onlending for the MWM and SWM \nsubprojects  will  be  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  onlending \narrangements for IWM subprojects will have a repayment period of 12 years including grace period \nof 4 years. SPG will charge a service fee of 0.2% to MWM and SWM components, and 0.5% to \npaper mills, as part of its onlending arrangements.27 The IAs will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. Appendix 6 illustrates the flow of funds. \n \n53.  Counterpart funds will come from county/municipal finance bureaus and self-financing by \nIAs. The IAs will fund the amounts required to be repaid to the city/county governments under the \nonlending arrangements through user charges and local government funds, where necessary. \nThese amounts, in turn, will be repaid to ADB through the municipal governments and SPG (Table \n2, Appendix 7, and Supplementary Appendix C). The nine subproject local governments confirmed \nin writing the availability of counterpart financing. \n \n54.  Except for civil works, disbursements will be made on the basis of up to 100% of eligible \nclaims received up to the allocated amount. Disbursements for civil works will be made on the \nbasis of the ratios specified in the Loan Agreement. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total          % \nAsian Development Bank Loan       80.00       49.90  \nMunicipal/County Governments       80.36       50.10  \nTotal  160.36  100.00 \n       Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n                                                 \n26  The cost of capacity building/training is $1.99 million, which is to be financed as follows: $1.50 million (ADB loan) and \n$0.49 (counterpart funds). \n27  The fee will cover an interest gap arising due to different timing of withdrawals by Shandong Provincial Finance Bureau \n(SPFB) from ADB, and by the IAs from SPFB.   \n ", "      11\nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n55.  SPG will be the Executing Agency responsible for overseeing implementation of the Project. \nIt has established a project leading group, headed by the vice governor of Shandong Province, and \nan SPMO headed by the deputy director general of Shandong Provincial Construction Bureau. The \nSPMO  includes  members  from  the  Shandong  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  (SPFB),  Shandong \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  and  Shandong  Provincial  Environmental \nProtection Bureau. The SPMO will oversee project implementation, and coordinate the work of the \nnine IAs and local governments. The SPMO is well-organized, with experience implementing \nseveral World Bank-funded projects. \n   \n56.  Each of the six local city/county governments involved in the Project also has established a \nleading group and an LPMO to oversee project preparation and implementation in its locality. The \nLPMO working groups comprise local governmental representatives, including from the relevant \nconstruction bureau, development and reform commission, finance bureau, price bureau, and \nenvironmental protection bureau. The LPMOs will be responsible for coordinating with SPMO \nthroughout the Project. Until the IAs are fully established and operational, the LPMOs will assist in \noverseeing/implementing activities required in the early stages of the Project.  \n \n57.  The IAs will be responsible for implementation of the subprojects during the Project, as well \nas the subsequent operation of the constructed facilities and provision of the services. A financial \nmanagement assessment of the IAs (Supplementary Appendix D) determined that the IWM IAs \nwere registered and had adequate operational  systems and procedures in place. For MWM and \nSWM IAs, state-owned companies have been established and registered with structures, systems, \nprocesses,  and  financial  management  to  be  developed  under  the  institutional  development \ncomponent. An implementation arrangements chart is in Appendix 8. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n58.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  from  2006  to  2011  (Appendix  9  and  Supplementary \nAppendix  E).  This  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable,  because  the  project \nimplementation structure is in place and preparatory work is under way.  \n   \n3.  Procurement \n \n59.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Civil  works  valued  at  $10  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  procured  using \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Government procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Civil works for less than $10 million will be procured using national competitive \nbidding (NCB). Local contractors possess the experience, expertise, and capacity to undertake the \nproposed civil works. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in \nthe bidding for NCB contracts. Equipment and materials estimated at $1 million or more will be \nprocured using international competitive bidding procedures and/or NCB, while those valued at \nless than $1 million will be procured through limited international bidding procedures. Goods \nvalued up to $100,000 will be procured through shopping. The internationally tendered equipment \npackages for the main process equipment will include the technical support for ensuring system \ncoordination, as well as installation, testing, commissioning, and training. The procurement plan is \nin Appendix 10 and in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "12     \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n60.   SPG will select and engage an international consulting firm in association with domestic \nconsultants,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of consultants. The local design institutes \nwill be hired by IAs to be funded by counterpart funds to undertake detailed engineering design \nand cost estimates. The international consulting firm will assist the SPMO, LPMOs, and the IAs in \nproject implementation and management, and related capacity building. The firm will be recruited \nusing ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. The Project will provide 51 person-months \nof  international  consulting  services  and  168  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services. \nConsulting services will cover (i) project management, predesign pilot studies, and implementation \nsupport;  (ii)  review  of  detailed  design  with  tender  documentation  and  bid  evaluation;  (iii) \nconstruction management and operating procedures; (iv) organization and operations structuring, \n(v) development of financial management, management information system (MIS), and human \nresource systems; (vi) corporate strategic planning, including tariff reforms, asset integration, and \nPSP; and (vii) social impact and environmental monitoring.  \n \n61.  Least  cost  selection  and/or  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  will  be  used  for  CDM \nimplementation  and  marketing.  The  scope  of  consulting  services  correspond  to  the  project \nobjectives and intended outcomes, the multisector nature of the Project, and the geographical \nspread of the nine IAs. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \n5.  Advance Action for Consultant Selection and Retroactive Financing \n \n62.  Advance procurement is required for consulting services for project implementation and \ntraining.  In  addition,  retroactive  financing  of  $1  million  equivalent  is  necessary  to  cover  the \nexpenditures for consulting services incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but not earlier than the \nfirst day of loan appraisal or a maximum of 12 months prior to loan signing, whichever is later. The \nadvance recruitment of consultants will be carried out in conformity with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. The Government has been advised that approval of early recruitment of \nconsultants does not commit ADB to approving or otherwise financing the Project. \n \n6.  Resettlement Monitoring \n \n63.  ADB requires internal and external monitoring of implementation of resettlement plans (RP). \nSPMO will provide ADB with semi-annual reports on the progress of implementing the RPs. One \ninternational social development specialist under consulting services will assist SPMO and IAs in \nfacilitating the internal monitoring and evaluation of resettlement, and preparing the semiannual \nprogress reports. The SPMO and IAs will recruit an independent agency for semiannual monitoring \nand annual evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement until 2 years after the completion of land \nacquisition and resettlement. The external monitor will (i) conduct site visits, (ii) review resettlement \nprogress, (iii) implement the agreed policy, (iv) restore the income of the affected people (AP), \n(v) support  the  training  programs,  and  (vi)  make  recommendations  to  resolve  any  issues. \nMonitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB, SPMO, and IAs, and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s Web site.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n64.  The ADB loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely \nrelease of loan proceeds, the SPFB (on behalf of SPG) will establish an imprest account promptly \nafter loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from the imprest \naccount will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. \n ", "      13\nThis  documentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  goods  and/or  services  were \nproduced in and procured from ADB member countries, and were eligible for ADB financing. The \nceiling and the initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account should not exceed 6 months \nof estimated expenditures, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  advances  not \nexceeding $200,000 equivalent per payment.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n65.  The  SPMO  will  submit  semi-annual  and  annual  progress  reports  to  ADB,  indicating \nprogress made and problems encountered during the review period, and a proposed program of \nactivities. The SPMO will ensure that reports are consolidated and submitted to ADB in a timely \nmanner. Within three (3) months of physical completion of the Project, the SPMO, with support \nfrom  the  LPMOs  and  IAs,  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  with  details  about \nimplementation, actual costs incurred relative to estimates, benefits, progress in the institutional \narea, and other information that ADB might request. \n   \n66.  The Executing Agency will maintain records and accounts that will identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. \nThe IAs will maintain separate project accounts and records. The project accounts and financial \nstatements will be established and maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles and \npractices as prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC, which requires enterprises to prepare \nfinancial statements and generally follow internationally accepted accounting standards. Project \naccounts and annual corporate financial statements for the IAs will be subject to an annual external \naudit (and subsequent translation) by auditors acceptable to ADB. External audits will be carried \nout in accordance with the State Council-approved regulations for auditing (1993), and will have to \nmeet ADB requirements. The annual audit reports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of \nthe loan proceeds and compliance with the financial covenants, and use of the imprest account \nand statement of expenditures procedures. The SPMO will provide ADB with the IAs' annual \naudited financial statements, audited project accounts, audit reports, and management letters in \nEnglish no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year during project implementation. \n \n67.  The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by due dates. If submission of a \nfinancial statement is delayed more than 6 months, a commitment letter will not be issued (if \napplicable), and ADB might not approve new contract awards. If the delay is more than 12 months, \nloan disbursements might be suspended or the loan canceled. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n68.  PPMS indicators were disclosed between ADB and the Borrower and it was agreed that \nindicators related to human dimensions are more relevant than physical infrastructure measures. \nThe agreed indicators include (i) service levels, (ii) treated wastewater quality, (iii) solid waste \nservices, (iv) other measures of operational performance, (v) percentage of wastewater collected \nand treated, (vi) user satisfaction with the urban environment, and (vii) relevant economic and \nhealth data to monitor project impacts. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the \nindicators were confirmed with the SPMO and IAs.  \n   \n69.  At the beginning of project implementation, the SPMO, LPMOs, and IAs, supported by \nconsultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to generate data for environmental, \nsocioeconomic, and health indicators to measure project impacts. ADB will provide grant support \nfor a pilot and demonstration activity (PDA), one objective of which will be to assist with the \n ", "14     \ndevelopment  of  public  health  impact  indicators  (Supplementary  Appendix  H). 28The  PPMS \nframework will be refined to confirm achievable targets and monitoring arrangements, and will be \nfinalized no later than 6 months after project inception. Under the PPMS framework, LPMOs will \nreport baseline and progress data at the requisite time intervals, including semiannual reporting on \nthe environmental management plan (EMP). With the assistance of the consultants, the SPMO will \nmonitor activities, analyze and consolidate the data through its MIS, and provide biannual PPMS \nmonitoring reports and annual reports to ADB until project completion. The PPMS reporting will \ncontinue for 5 years after project completion. The PPMS will be designed with adequate flexibility \nto adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n70.  The Government, SPG, IAs, and ADB will review the Project jointly on an annual basis  \nthroughout  implementation.  The  reviews  will  cover  institutional  development,  tariff  structures, \ndesign quality, construction standards, scope, overall implementation, resettlement, and status of \ncompliance with loan covenants. A midterm review will be carried out during the third year of \nimplementation, covering a comprehensive discussion of the Project\u2019s institutional development \ncomponent, and identifying potential loan savings and items for reallocation of loan proceeds. \nFeedback from the PPMS will be addressed during review missions. \n     \n11.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n71.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, the Government and \nSPG. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nExecuting Agency and the IAs, as well as all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n72.  Environmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  pollution  control  in  the  HRB, \nparticularly in the Tuhai\u2013Majia River system. The multisector and multimedia approach to pollution \nprevention  in  the  HRB  will  provide  the  most  sustainable  prospects  for  reducing  waterborne \npollution, achieving surface water quality targets, and improving living conditions in the project \nareas. \n \n73.  The improved wastewater collection and treatment systems will contribute to a significant \nreduction of COD (75%) and ammonia nitrogen (50%) in the receiving rivers, enabling each \nsubproject area to attain the limits set by the T5YP. The industrial reuse of treated effluent will \nmeet the need for water conservation facing the project areas.  \n \n74.  Under the SWM component, improvement of collection, transport, and disposal will address \nthe need to treat the growing volume of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner and \nreduce contamination of the urban environment. The new sanitary landfills with leachate collection \nwill minimize the waste constituents discharge into the relevant aquifers, reducing groundwater \ncontamination. The efficient collection of LFG with the use of CDM will reduce environmental \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Promoting Effective Water Management Policies and Practices\u2014Phase 3. Manila \n(TA 6123-REG, approved on 3 October). Under this RETA, $75,000 has been applied for to support this PDA. \n ", "      15\nhazards  to  the  surrounding  communities,  while  destruction/utilization  of  methane  will  mitigate \nemissions of GHGs that contributes to global climate change. \n  \n75.  The new alkali recovery processes for the paper mills will reduce significantly volumes of \nCOD.29 The use of chemicals in the pulp paper making and wastewater treatment, and save the \nenergy and water consumption. With the new alkali recovery processes, the unlined lagoons for \ntreated black liquor and lignin30 storage will not be used and will be closed, reducing the risks of \ngroundwater contamination.     \n \n76.  The environmental impact assessment (EIA) for each subproject covers all phases from \nproject design to construction and operation. All EIAs conclude that the Project will have positive \nimpacts on the environment, and that environmentally adverse impacts generated by the Project \ncould be reduced to acceptable levels through mitigation and monitoring measures specified in the \nEMP. The summary EIA, which describes the environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and \nmonitoring plans, is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n77.  Institutional  Reforms.  The  institutional  development  component  aims  to  establish \nmanagerially autonomous, operationally efficient, and financially self-sustaining SWM and MWM \ncompanies. This is a pioneering attempt in the SWM sector in the PRC, which is in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy to reduce its direct involvement in waste management. Key actions include \n(i)  legal  and  corporate  institutional  strengthening;  (ii)  strategic  planning  for  SWM  and  MWM \ncompanies, including phased integration of all value chain assets, corporate governance, and PSP \ndevelopment;  (iii)  development  of  operations  manual,  financial  systems,  and  MIS;  (iv) \nestablishment  of  effective  tariff-setting  and  collection  systems;  and  (v)  training  of  key  staff \n(Supplementary Appendix J).  \n \n78.  For IWM, the Project will catalyze the development of explicit PSP strategies for the two \npaper mills. Consultants will work with the two companies and stakeholders in assessing and \nrecommending PSP options, as a basis for subsequent implementation. The options include (i) \ncapital markets listing on Shanghai or a similar stock exchange, with the Government\u2019s stake \nsubstantially  reduced;  (ii)  sale  of  equity  in  the  company  to  a  private  sector  entity;  and  (iii) \nestablishing joint ventures (Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n79.  Health Benefits. The causal link between poor sanitation and the incidence of water- and \nvector-related diseases is well established.31 The World Health Organization reports that sufficient \nevidence exists that improved water supply and sanitation significantly affect human health.32 By \nimproving environmental and sanitary conditions in the project areas, the Project is expected to \nreduce the incidence of water- and vector-related diseases, and improve living conditions of the \npopulation. Based on project survey data of 1,200 respondents, health costs have been computed \nand health benefits have been estimated for 2009\u20132024 (Supplementary Appendix K). The PPMS, \nin conjunction with the proposed PDA (Supplementary Appendix H), will develop indicators for \nmonitoring the public health impact of the Project. \n \n80.  Poverty Reduction. A poverty and social analysis (PSA) report was prepared focusing on \ndisadvantaged stakeholders, and analyzing positive and negative social impacts. In addition, an \naffordability analysis was conducted on two representative household groups: the average-income \ngroup, and the low-income group.33 The proposed tariff is affordable for both groups, with the \n                                                 \n29 About 292,200 t/y for Quanlin Paper Mill and 1,550 t/y for Changyuan Paper Mill. \n30 Lignin is a leftover substance from plants after the pulp-making process. \n31  See Supplementary Appendix D on definitions and disease categorization. \n32  Such improvements, for example, lead to potential 80\u2013100% reductions in morbidity for cholera and typhoid, and 40\u2013\n50% reductions for diarrheal diseases, dysentery, and gastroenteritis (World Health Organization. 1992. Seminar on \nWater and Public Health. Geneva).  \n33  Defined as the households\u2019 earning for the average of the lowest 10th percentile of income distribution.  \n ", "16     \nmonthly water and wastewater bill accounting for 2.5% of the income of average family and 4.0% \nof that of the low-income households. The solid waste disposal bill accounts for 0.4% of the income \nof the average family and 1.0% of that of the low-income family. For the poorest households, the \ncity/county  governments  provide  minimum  living  standard  scheme  (MLSS),  which  includes  a \nprovision  for  lifeline  utility  services.34 The  county/city  governments  also  provide  rebates  on \nwater/wastewater  bills  to  all  households  qualifying  for  social  assistance  with  the  recent  tariff \nincrease.   \n \n81.  The Project will benefit more than 3.9 million people in the project areas, including 2.2 \nmillion in the direct project area and 1.7 million in the indirect project area. Of the beneficiary \npopulation, 6.5% live below the local poverty line. The PSA shows that the Project will contribute to \n(i) improved wastewater and solid waste facilities and services; (ii) reduced air, surface, and \ngroundwater pollution; (iii) reduced risks of exposure to disease vectors; (iv) increased employment \nand income-generating activities; (v) reduced risks of people falling into poverty due to closure of \npaper mills; and (vi) improved urban living environment and increased quality of life. \n \n82.  Construction works under the Project will create jobs for the local community, particularly \nfor the poor. The Project will require an estimated 14,000 person-months of work, including 40% of \ndirect employment and 60% of indirect employment opportunities for local people including women \nand the poor. Women in the project area will be engaged for the public education and awareness \nprogram to promote hygiene education and social acceptance of tariff increases (see draft PDA \nproposal). The PPMS, RPs, and EMP will include gender-disaggregated data where relevant. The \nsocioeconomic survey indicates that less than 1% of the population in the project areas belongs to \nethnic minorities, and they have no norms and settlements distinct from the major ethnic group. \nConsequently, ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy does not apply to the Project (Appendix 11). \n \n83.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project will affect people through (i) permanent \nacquisition of land for the WWTP, SWM, and pumping stations; (ii) temporary use of land for \ninstallation of trunk sewers and water pipelines; and (iii) demolition of buildings. Seven of the nine \nsubprojects will have land acquisition and resettlement impacts affecting seven villages and three \nenterprises. Resettlement requirements have been considered carefully and incorporated into the \nproject design.35 Land acquisition and resettlement is estimated to cost CNY71 million, including \ncontingencies and taxes. \n \n84.  RPs for the seven subprojects have been prepared in accordance with the PRC Land \nAdministration Law (1998), the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly Enforce Land \nAdministration (2004), and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The RPs provide a \nsocioeconomic profile of APs and the scope of impacts. They also address (i) APs\u2019 entitlements to \ncompensation,  (ii)  legal  framework,  (iii)  public  consultations,  (iv)  grievance  procedures,  (v) \nrehabilitation measures, (vi) budget, and (vii) implementation milestones. SPG has confirmed its \nsupport  for  the  resettlement  activities,  and  all  concerned  IAs  have  confirmed  funding.  The \nsummary RP is in Appendix 12. \n \n85.  SPG and the IAs have complied with the ADB full disclosure policy for the resettlement \nactivities: (i) the draft RPs, or Resettlement Information Booklet, have been distributed to affected \nhouseholds and village offices; (ii) the final RPs will be made available in village offices and \n                                                 \n34  The county and city governments also provide rebate on water/wastewater bills to households qualifying for social \nassistance with the recent increase in water/wastewater tariffs. \n35  The Project will acquire permanently about 101.5 hectares (ha) of land, of which 37% is farmland. Permanent land \nacquisition will affect approximately 610 people in 123 households and three enterprises. The Project also will require \ntemporary acquisition of 39 ha of land, most of which is urban roadways. No households will need to be relocated. \nAbout 30,450 m2 of structures will be demolished, all of which are old or abandoned buildings belonging to the \nenterprises. \n ", "      17\nresident committees; and (iii) the RPs have been uploaded to the ADB Web site. The respective \nIAs  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  for  supervising  implementation,  continuing  public \nconsultation, monitoring progress, and responding to grievances. Resettlement training workshops \nwere  held  for  local  government  officials,  local  land  departments,  and  the  IAs  during  project \npreparation. To ensure that APs have been compensated adequately and rehabilitated, SPG and \nthe IAs will keep ADB informed of RP implementation through semi-annual and annual progress \nreports  until  resettlement  is  complete.  In  addition,  they  will  prepare  and  submit  resettlement \ncompletion  reports.  SPG  and  the  IAs  will  engage  an  independent  agency  for  semiannual \nmonitoring and annual evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement until 2 years after  the \ncompletion of resettlement.  \n \n86.  Financial  Analysis.  To  assess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  Project, \nfinancial projections have been prepared for each of the IAs in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB. Based \non these financial projections, operating ratios, current ratios, and debt-equity ratios will be at \nacceptable levels for all IAs. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 13, and details are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix L. Currently, with multilayered and multi-agency involvement \nin the SWM, ascertaining the true cost of services is difficult. Under the Project, more transparent \nfee-setting and collection mechanisms will be implemented in conjunction with corporatization so \nthat user fees will be sufficient to cover the costs of waste collection, transport, and disposal. The \nincorporation of CDM into SWM through LFG recovery has created an incremental revenue stream \nof emission credits, and has provided incentive to SWM companies to be more efficient in landfill \noperations. \n \n87.  An affordability analysis of MWM and SWM subprojects showed that proposed wastewater \ntariffs and solid waste fees should be set at levels affordable to average and poorer households. \nBased on the detailed assessment (Appendix 13), the potential risk that the proposed fees might \nexceed household affordability is considered minimal. An analysis of municipal finances indicates \nthat requirements for project counterpart funds in the cities/counties concerned are affordable and \nfunds have been earmarked by cities/counties to assure timely availability of counterpart funds.  \n \n88.  The financial evaluation of MWM and SWM subprojects was undertaken in real terms using \nconstant 2005 prices. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), computed on an after-tax basis, \nranges from 5% to 8% for MWM subprojects. For SWM subprojects, the range is from 7.1% to \n9.1%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 3.4%, which \nalso was computed on an after-tax basis. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR is \nrobust under adverse conditions. Financial analysis of IWM subprojects indicates the financial \nsoundness of the IAs, which achieve minimum thresholds for debt service coverage.  \n \n89.  Economic Analysis. The economic analysis of the Project shows that the legal standards \nand environmental targets are consistent with economic principles for water quality management, \nand conform to international practices. The Project is an integral component of the SHRB Plan, as \nwell as of the municipal, provincial, and basin-wide environmental programs to meet the water \nquality targets for the HRB and to achieve least-cost pollution control in the project areas. \n \n90.  Major benefits of the Project resulting from improved MWM and SWM services are a \ncleaner and more sustainable urban environment. Disease prevention/mitigation and environment \ncleanup, as well as reduction in time lost to diseases, generated cost savings. Anticipated benefits \njustify undertaking the Project from the economic point of view. Economic internal rates of return \n(EIRR), calculated for all subprojects, are higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital \n(EOCC) of 12%. The following EIRRs were calculated: (i) for MWM subprojects, 17.5% for Binzhou, \n17.7% for Gaotang, 17.9% for Linqing, and 15.8% for Shanghe; (ii) for SWM subprojects, 21.7% \nfor Linqing, 19.4% for Linyi, and 22.4% for Zouping; and (iii) for IWM subprojects, 19.8% for \n ", "18     \nChangyuan paper mill and 23.9% for Quanlin paper mill. A detailed economic analysis is in \nAppendix 14 and in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n91.  Project Risks. Potential project risks relate mainly to institutional and financial factors: (i) \ninadequate political support for institutional reforms in SWM and MWM sectors, corporatization, \nand  integration  process;  resistance  to  change  to  commercial  operations;  and  lack  of  staffing \nresources;  (ii)  resistance  to  required  tariff  setting/collection  mechanisms;  (iii)  low  user  fee \ncollections that threaten financial sustainability; and (iv) decline in private sector interest triggered \nby external factors. To mitigate these risks, a comprehensive institutional development program will \nbe developed and implemented in coordination with all relevant departments to ensure support for \nthe  proper  restructuring  of  SWM  sector.  Training  programs  for  the  new  companies  will  be \ndeveloped under the Project. The detailed tariff-setting/collection mechanisms will be developed in \na participatory way, with a view to strengthening the regulatory functions of the local authorities.   \n \n92.  Another potential risk involves weak enforcement of separate collection of hazardous and \nmunicipal wastes, and pretreatment of industrial wastewater. Changes in design standards and \nenvironmental compliance requirements to be introduced in the 11th 5-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) \ncould  pose  another  risk.  However,  these  risks  will  be  minimized  by  (i)  developing  detailed \nguidelines for collection and reporting procedures, including handling of hazardous wastes; (ii) \ntraining waste collectors to avoid mixed collection; (iii) implementing spot checks and surveys \naround landfill sites; and (iv) collaboration closely with, and sharing information among, local \nEnvironmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs) and provincial/country EPBs.  \n \n93.  Sustainability. The pollution reduction, institutional, and financial benefits of the Project are \nexpected to be sustainable, mainly because of the commitment at all levels of the Government to \npollution control in river basins, particularly in the HRB. Several other factors also will contribute to \nproject sustainability: (i) the actions already taken to establish wastewater companies that will \noperate on commercial basis, (ii) enactment of Tariff Regulation 1192 to ensure financial viability, \n(iii) financial covenants under the Project to ensure adequacy of tariffs, and (iv) provision of actions \nfor institutional development and capacity building under the Project.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n94.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SPG have agreed to include \nthe following assurances in the legal documents:36 \n \n(i)  Each of the Linqing, Linyi, and Zouping SWM companies shall, in accordance with PRC \nenvironmental requirements, close their existing solid waste landfills (a) by 31 December \n2007, (b) within 12 months from the commencement of Project landfill operations, and (c) \nwithin 18 months of the commencement of Project landfill operations, respectively.

This  component  aims  to  increase  the  project  scope  from  merely  creating  assets  to \neffectively utilizing project-created assets in a sustainable manner. The implementing agencies (IA) \nfor municipal wastewater management (MWM) and solid waste management (SWM) are in the \nearly  stages  of  development.  As  such,  this  component  initially  establishes  and  strengthens \ninstitutional structures for the IAs. This component focuses on assisting the IAs to financial and \noperational independence,  efficiency,  and  sustainability;  as  well  as  on  strategic development, \nincluding private sector participation (PSP).  \n \nA.  Analysis of Existing Implementing Agencies  \n \n2.  The IAs\u2019 financial management and institutional capacity were assessed using financial \nmanagement  questionnaires,  which  cover  (i)  legal  structure;  (ii)  operational  structure;  (iii) \nprocesses; and (iv) financial, human resources, and MIS systems (Supplementary Appendix E). \nOne MWM IA is registered as a company (though it is non-operational), while the other three \nMWMs IAs and three SWM IAs are to be registered before loan negotiations. Thus, the seven \nMWM  and  SWM  companies  require  organizational,  operational,  human  resources,  and  MIS \nsystems; as well as corporate planning development.  \n \n3.  The  MWM  and  SWM  value  chain  assets  (e.g.,  existing  sewerage  network,  and  new \ntreatment  plants  and  landfills)  and  processes  are  industrial  wastewater  management  (IWM) \nsubprojects for existing paper mills. These have company structures, operational procedures, \nfinancial management, and human resources development systems. \n \n4.  Local  project  management  offices  (LPMO)  have  been  set  up  to  monitor  the  project \nconstruction phase. The LPMOs are in the early stages of development, with only senior level staff \nassigned,  and  require  additional  staffing  and  training  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprocedures. While the Shandong Project Management Office (SPMO) has experience with the \nWorld Bank, it does not have any experience with implementing ADB loans. Thus, the SPMO \nneeds strengthening during project implementation. \n \nB.  Proposed Institutional Strengthening Program \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s \u201cmarketization reform policy\u201d for the MWM and SWM sectors aims to \nincrease efficiencies, reduce overhead costs, achieve true cost accounting, and improve service \ndelivery.1 The policy advocates operational and managerial reforms to create sustainable MWM \nand SWM utilities through the promotion of market economy principles, PSP, and user fees that \nallow full cost recovery.2 Some large city utilities have been reformed into such market-oriented \ncompanies, promoting competition and commercialization of operations management. However, \nwith few detailed guidelines for implementing the national policy, the fourth-tier local governments \nneed assistance in implementing such reforms, especially in the SWM sector.  \n \n6.  For the MWM and SWM subprojects, the goal of institutional development is to establish \nfinancially sustainable, operationally efficient, and managerially autonomous enterprises that can \naddress long-term sector requirements. Discussions with the Government produced an agreement \non corporatization, tariff reform, PSP, and accountability for operations and debt repayment to the \nenterprises for MWM and SWM sectors, which require short-term Government support. For the \nIWM subprojects, the focus is on the evaluation and implementation of PSP.  \n                                                 \n1 Marketization implies a gradual move towards commercial operations and include accountability of management, cost \nrecovery, operational efficiency, and financial sustainability with gradual reduction in government subsidies. \n2 ADB. 2003.

Fewer projects have been undertaken in the SWM sector than in the MWM sector. The \nconceptualized structure for each SWM subproject includes integrating, eventually, the entire value \nchain (waste collection to landfill treatment) into one corporate body. This takes into consideration \n(i)  separating  monitoring  and  regulation  from  operations;  (ii)  identifying  a  single  body  to  be \naccountable for all SWM functions; (iii) generating alternative sources of funds in the long term; (iv) \ndeveloping PSP in the long term, including outsourcing and joint ventures (JVs) for future SWM \noperations; and (v) ensuring financial sustainability, managerial efficiency, and good governance \n(Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n8.  A road map has been developed that presents a gradual and phased approach for the \nsubprojects. From this road map, actions to be undertaken during loan implementation have been \nidentified (Figure A2.1). \n \n9.  For the MWM and SWM IAs, the short-term goal is the establishment of a well-structured \nand efficient company to manage project-created assets. The medium-term goal is to consolidate \nthe existing and new (i.e., the project facilities) MWM and SWM assets and processes in the \nproject  areas,  formalize  tariff-setting  processes,  and  structure  tariff-collection  mechanisms. \nInstitutional  development  consultants  will  take  specific  actions  during  loan  implementation, \nincluding  (i)  legal  and  organizational  structuring,  (ii)  operational  structuring,  (iii)  strategic \norganizational planning (developing a time-based action plan), and (iv) capacity building at the \nlocal government level. The detailed action steps matrix is in Supplementary Appendix H. An \nestimated  12  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  36  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services will be needed for the institutional development activities. \n \nC.  Proposed PSP Strategy for MWM and SWM   \n10.  ADB policy considers private sector development to be \u201ccrucial for the long-term, rapid \neconomic  growth  of  a  country,  a  necessary  condition  for  sustained  poverty  reduction.\u201d 3 \nRecognizing  this  strategy,  the  Project  evaluated  the  introduction  of PSP  into  the  subprojects \nthrough extensive dialogue with the provincial and local governments, IAs, and public and private \nsector entities in the relevant sectors. As discussed in Supplementary Appendix A, the Project also \nresearched past experiences and best practices.  \n \n11.  Involving the private sector in the subprojects before construction is considered unrealistic, \nin light of the (i) small-scale capacities of subprojects; (ii) subproject locations in counties with low \neconomic development; (iii) local government capacity constraints and limited experience with \ncommercial market principles and practices, performance benchmarks, and regulatory and tariff \nstructures; (iv) inefficient and fragmented nature of MWM and SWM operations without links to \nexisting MWM sewerage networks, SWM collection, and transfer processes; and (v) likelihood that \nPSP in new asset construction only would lead to potential underinvestment in assets remaining \noutside the scope of an early PSP. Stakeholders have identified distortions where PSP was \nintroduced without sufficient regard to sector reform. This has led to new assets operating under \ncapacity and paying for fixed usage capacities per contract, poor performance monitoring, etc. \n \n12.  The  institutional  development  component,  therefore,  addresses  overall  sector  structure \nissues to implicitly catalyze sustainable PSP in the subprojects. Under this component, consultants \nwill assist each MWM and SWM IA in evaluating potential options for PSP, leading to a viable PSP \noption  with  a  realistic  and  detailed  timetable  for  implementation.  PSP  options  that  can  be \nconsidered include (i) joint ventures between MWM IAs and private sector entities; (ii) development \nof private holding company structures for all MWM and/or SWM assets in the local areas, with PSP \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy. Manila. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \noptions at the holding company level; (iii) flotation of larger holding companies; and (iv) operations \nand maintenance (O&M) contracts for SWM landfills/treatment plants. The IAs expressed keen \ninterest in developing these PSP options.  \n \n13.  The PSP action plan for each MWM/SWM IA is to be completed within 2 years from loan \neffectiveness.  Once  approved  by  ADB  and  SPG,  the  recommended  PSP  option  will  be \nimplemented within 5 years from loan effectiveness. Since a successful listing process or JV \nagreement also depends on external factors, however, completion of the chosen PSP option might \ntake more time.  \n \n14.  Binzhou MWM. The Binzhou MWM subproject has a more conducive environment for PSP \nsince it has a captive customer base in the economic development zone, and the LPMO and IA \nhave expressed strong interest in PSP. Thus, in addition to corporatization, an accelerated PSP \nstrategy formation is to be pursued, probably leading to private sector equity involvement in the IA. \nLoan consultants, therefore, will evaluate and recommend time-bound options for PSP, including \nJV and other potential PSP arrangements, within 18 months of loan effectiveness. Following ADB \nand SPG approval, implementation of the agreed PSP option is to commence in the third year from \nloan effectiveness.  \n \nD.  Proposed PSP Strategy for IWM: Quanlin and Changyuan Paper Mills \n \n15.  Pulp  and  paper  mills  are  large  contributors  to  environmental  pollution  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\u2019s (PRC). Thus, an effective environmental pollution control project is needed to \naddress this issue. Noting that the non-wood pulping sector produces 44% of all industrial chemical \noxygen demand (COD) pollutants, the World Bank has provided financial support for the Chengwu \nPaper Mills in Anhui Province.4 Quanlin Paper Mill\u2019s discharges of 74,900 cubic meter per day \n(m3/day) of water to the river only meet current discharge standards of 300 milligram per liter (mg/l) \nCOD through existing water treatment processes. Changyuan paper mill\u2019s discharges of 20,000 \nm3/day are at 400 mg/l COD levels. As both will be unable to comply with the new discharge \nstandards of 120 mg/l COD levels by 2010, they require new and more effective water treatment \nsystems.  \n \n16.  Private  sector  funding  for  the  required  environmental  improvements  is  not  available, \nbecause commercial banks are unwilling to lend to projects that do not generate revenue, such as \nenvironmental  pollution  control  improvements.  Further,  in  the  absence  of  commercial  bank \nfinancing, the threat of closure will dampen potential interest from private sector entities at this \nstage. \n \n17.  If the required environmental measures are not implemented, the potential closure of the \npaper mills poses a major threat to the local economies. In addition to employees and their families, \nlocal farmers supplying straw are dependent on the paper mills for employment and income. \nQuanlin  employs  11,000  and  Changyuan  employs  1,500,  and  both  mills  support  large  pulp \nplantations  in  their  counties.  The  Project  will  fund  the  construction  of  effective  black  liquor \ntreatment and wastewater treatment facilities at the two paper mills to (i) serve as environmental \npollution control measures in addressing the existing externality, (ii) protect the local economy, and \n(iii)  catalyze  improvements  in  the  potential  of  the  enterprise  to  attract  PSP  following  its \nenvironmental upgrade.  \n \n18.  The institutional development component explicitly includes introducing PSP in the two \npaper mills. Both companies have agreed to develop a time-bound strategy for PSP, which will \n                                                 \n4 World Bank. 1997. Huai River Basin Pollution Control Project. Washington, DC. \n ", "  Appendix 2   27\ninclude (i) capital markets listing on the Shanghai or similar stock exchange, with the Government \nstake reduced substantially; (ii) sale of Government equity to a private sector entity; and (iii) \nstrategic alliance with a private sector entity, combined with a contracting out and outsourcing \nstrategy. The first option was considered more likely for Quanlin paper mill, while the third option \nseemed more likely for the smaller Changyuan paper mill.  \n \n19.  During project implementation, the consultants will work with Quanlin and Changyuan, local \ngovernments, and potential private sector entities to evaluate PSP options. The consultants will \nrecommend a viable PSP strategy and time-bound action plan for implementing the approved PSP \noption. The evaluation will include (i) stock market regulatory requirements, (ii) market demand \nassessment, (iii) employee equity participation, and (iv) discussions with private sector entities on \nvaluations. The recommended PSP strategy and action plan will be completed and submitted to \nSPMO, local governments, and ADB within 18 months from loan effectiveness. The concerned \nparties will review, discuss, and approve them within 6 months. The agreed PSP strategy then will \nbe implemented starting in third year from loan effectiveness.  \n \n20.  A capital market listing would involve (i) applying for regulatory clearance for a stock \nexchange (SE) listing, (ii) organizing structural changes as required, (iii) appointing investment \nbanks and legal advisors, and (iv) marketing and promotions. Any further ADB involvement to \nassist in supporting the implementation process will be considered at the midterm review.  \n \n21.  The PSP strategies included in this appendix are considered realistic, given the PRC\u2019s \nexperience in this sector in the PRC. As shown by Shandong Chenming Paper Mill, a former state-\nowned enterprise (SOE) now listed domestically, joint ventures and stock market flotations are \npossible. Therefore, the Project is catalyzing a move towards PSP for the two paper mills. In turn, \nthis is linked with funding the required environmental pollution control assets for IWMs to achieve \nthe pollution control targets in the Shandong Hai River Basin.  \n \n ", " \n                                                                                         Table A2: Institutional Development Road Map 2\n  8\nLoan Approval Period                      Loan Implementation Period  (2006\u20132010)                           Operational Period (from 2011)   \n \nComponent 1 - SPMOs/Local Government PMOs   \n \nStrengthening of SPMO and   \n \nLPMOs (local govt.

", "  Appendix 3  29 \nPOTENTIAL FOR CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM \n \n1.  The  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  was  created  as  one  of  the  three  market \nmechanisms to mitigate global climate change under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Kyoto Protocol sets targets for \nindustrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These targets became \nlegally binding on 16 February 2005. The CDM is intended as a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution to reducing \nglobal GHG emissions.  \n \n2.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) ratified the UNFCCC on 5 January 1993 and the \nKyoto Protocol on 30 August 2002. A designated national authority (DNA) has been established, \nwhich is co-chaired by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the \nMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST). Provisional CDM regulations have been issued, and \ntook effect in June 2004. With numerous projects under development, including three financed by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), the PRC is expected to become one of the largest host \ncountries of the CDM.1    \n \n3.  As part of ADB's efforts to promote clean energy initiatives and minimize adverse local, \nregional, and global impacts, the CDM facility was established in ADB in August 2003. This \nfacility focuses on bridging the gaps in the evolving carbon market in the Asia and Pacific region. \nIt also assists with CDM project activity identification, development, validation, and registration. \nThe facility does not purchase the emission reductions (ER), known as carbon credits. Rather, it \nplays the role of a facilitator in the carbon market by bringing in multiple buyers for negotiation. \n \n4.  The Project has a potential to reduce GHG emissions and benefit from the use of the \nCDM. The ADB CDM facility identified the CDM potential of the solid waste management (SWM) \nsubprojects, as shown in Table A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1: Basic Characteristics of Proposed SWM Subprojects \nItem  Capacity  Treatment  Design  Land  Service Area  Service  Leachate \n(t/day)  Process  Life  Area  (km2), 2010  population  Treatment \n(yrs)  (ha)  2015  (m3/day) \nLinqing  Sanitary \n400  15  24.5  15.0  417,000  150 \nCity   Landfill \nLinyi  Sanitary \n200  20  20.4  40.0  178,000  80 \nCounty  Landfill \nZouping  Sanitary  15 \n400  41.8  24.8  382,000  150 \nCounty  Landfill   \nha = hectare, km = kilometer, m3/day = cubic meter per day, SWM = solid waste management, t/day = ton per day. \nSource: Feasibility study reports by Design Institutes, June 2005. \n \n5.  The proposed SWM subprojects will install proper landfill gas (LFG) extraction and flare \nand utilization systems. These will reduce emissions of methane, a highly potent GHG contained \nin LFG (approximately 40\u201350%), as well as mitigate environmental and safety hazards to nearby \ncommunities. LFG emissions from landfills result from the biological decomposition of organic \nwaste. Gas production typically ramps up, peaking between years 8 and 10 of landfill operation.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

The project has attracted favorable bids from potential \nbuyers, and negotiations with the short-listed entities are continuing. \n ", "30        Appendix 3     \n6.  The proposed Project was assessed against the key eligibility criteria for CDM projects. A \nsummary of the results is in Table A3.2. \n \nTable A3.2:  Eligibility Criteria Compliance of the SWM Component \nEligibility Criteria  Result \nInvolve greenhouse gas covered under the Kyoto Protocol  Yes \nHost country is a party to the Kyoto Protocol  Yes \nAdditionalitya  Likely \nMeets \u201cnon-diversion of ODA\u201d criterion  Yes \nContribute to sustainable development objectives  Likely \nMeasurable emission reductions  Yes \nProject type  Yes \nEligible organization  Yes \nODA = official development assistance. \n a The Kyoto Protocol states that \u201cthe emission reductions of the project must be additional to any that would occur in \nthe absence of the project\u201d. An \u201cadditionality\u201d analysis must be conducted to determine if changes in GHG emissions \nare beyond what would occur under a business-as-usual scenario. \nSource: ADB CDM facility. \n \n7.  Financial Potential. Under a conservative scenario of LFG generation and collection and \nutilization, the Linqing SWM subprojects have the potential to reduce approximately 400,000, \n200,000, and 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO e) of GHGs, respectively, over the \n2\n10-year crediting period.2 The potential value of these ERs is estimated at $6.5 million\u2013$10 \nmillion.3 Through ADB\u2019s CDM facility, which facilitates the bidding process and allows negotiation \nof credit sales with multiple buyers, (i) required preparation time could be reduced, (ii) value of \ncredits could be maximized, and (iii) direct transaction costs could be minimized.4 The financial \nanalysis demonstrates that the value of these ERs will more than offset the additional costs \nassociated with developing the project in accordance with CDM requirements, including capital \ncosts for gas collection and flaring/utilization.  \n \n8.  Other  CDM Benefits. Application of CDM to the SWM component will provide other \nimportant benefits:  \n(i)  Improve waste collection efficiency. The amount of LFG generation depends heavily \non disposed waste volume and its organic content. Efficient collection of organic waste \nwill contribute to environmental benefits throughout the project areas. Large amounts of \nfood and agricultural waste that is currently uncollected and piled in the fields or along \nstreets are often sources of odor, rodents, and water contamination.  \n(ii)  Properly seal the sides and top of the landfill. Rather than escaping randomly, LFG \nwill be collected through the intended chambers for the gas to be utilized, which will \nreduce the amount of uncollected LFG causing odor and affecting nearby communities.  \n(iii)  Properly compact the waste. By preventing air from entering the cells, a higher ratio of \nmethane in LFG to be utilized will be maintained, which will extend the life of the landfills. \n(iv)  Utilize LFG as an alternative source of energy for heat, hot water, and electricity. \nThis will give additional carbon revenues, as SWM entities claim GHG reductions from \navoided coal use. \n                                                 \n2  The Kyoto Protocol defines three \u201ccommitments periods\u201d: 2008\u20132012 (first period), 2013\u20132017 (second), 2018\u20132022 \n(third). At this time, the signatories to the protocol have agreed to mandatory reduction commitments only during the \nfirst period.  \n3  Using a price of $6.5\u2013$10 per tCO e. Carbon prices have been rising steadily, and several reports predict prices to \n2\nbe well above $10 per tCO e by 2010. Since the Kyoto Protocol came into effect in February 2005, the European \n2\nUnion emission allowance prices range near \u20ac20 per tCO e. \n2\n4  The CDM facility recovers the direct costs incurred once an emission reduction purchase agreement is successfully \nnegotiated between a buyer and the project developer. \n ", "  Appendix 3  31 \n9.  The  estimated  financial  benefits  for  these  SWM  subprojects  are  $3.25  million\u2013$7.50 \nmillion, assuming an average price of $6.5\u2013$10.0 per tCO e and 500,000\u2013750,000 tCO e of \n2 2\nGHGs during the first 10 years. To maximize the future financial benefits of CDM, sufficient \nbudget has been allocated to SWM subprojects to enhance the efficiency of LFG collection, \nutilization, and destruction. Upon further due diligence and confirmation of financial, technical, \nand institutional feasibilities, ADB\u2019s CDM facility will provide comprehensive support to the Project \nto develop CDM documentation, as well as negotiate with potential buyers of carbon credits. This \nwill include (i) supporting CDM registration through preparation of the project design document \nand new baseline/monitoring methodologies (if necessary), assistance in obtaining host country \napproval, and facilitation of validation by a designated operational entity (DOE); (ii) assisting in \nmarketing and negotiating the carbon credits by identifying potential buyer(s), and preparing a \ndraft  emission  reduction  purchase  agreement  (ERPA)  between  the  project  developer  and \nbuyer(s); and (iii) providing capacity building for project staff (including conducting basic and \nadvanced training) of the project developer and any other stakeholders, as required, during the \nCDM project development process. \n \n10.  The CDM facility offers these services on a no-risk,5 conditional cost recovery basis.6 Only \nif the project is registered successfully with the CDM Environmental Bureau, and a transaction \nwith buyer(s) is made, the direct costs (with no margin or fees) will be recovered from the project \ndeveloper or the buyer(s). \n \n                                                 \n5  No-risk for the project developer. ADB only will recover direct costs if the CDM facility is successful in achieving the \nfollowing: registering the project with the CDM Environmental Bureau, and negotiating an ERPA on the project \ndeveloper\u2019s behalf. \n6  Costs would be recovered from the first payments to the project developer under an ERPA. \n ", "         \n3\n  Table A4.4: External Assistance Funded by Asian Development Bank 2\n \nNo.  Project  Date of    Loan/TA Amount   Status  Performance   A\n      Approval   ($-Million)      Ratea    p\nA.

The physical infrastructure components of the Project consist of (i) municipal wastewater \nmanagement (MWM) in four subprojects, (ii) industrial wastewater management (IWM) in two \nsubprojects, and (iii) solid waste management (SWM) in three subprojects. \n  \nA.  Municipal Wastewater Management \n \n2.  Binzhou City. The service area is the Binzhou Economic Development Zone (BEDZ), \nwhich covers 86,000 people. BEDZ does not have a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and \napproximately 24,000 tons/day (t/d) of untreated wastewater is discharged into the Xisha River. \nThis subproject consists of a 40,000 t/d secondary WWTP, a 30,000 t/d tertiary reuse water \ntreatment plant, 65 kilometers (km) of sewer and 17 km of reuse water piping, and a 30,000 t/d \ncapacity  lift  station.  This  WWTP  is  expected  to  have  sufficient  capacity  beyond  2015. \nApproximately 75% of the secondary treatment effluent will be purified further for industrial \nreuse. The remaining 10,000 t/d of secondary treatment effluent will be discharged to the Xisha \nRiver. Sludge generated from this WWTP will be dewatered and disposed of in a municipal \nlandfill.  \n \n3.  Gaotang County. The service area has about 150,000 people. Approximately 100,000 \nt/d of untreated wastewater is discharged into the Majia River, a tributary in the Hai River Basin \n(HRB). This subproject includes (i) a 40,000 t/d secondary WWTP; (ii) a 40,000 t/d tertiary reuse \nwater treatment plant; and (iii) 23 km of sewer, trunk sewer, and reuse water piping. The \nwastewater will undergo tertiary treatment for industrial reuse. The dewatered sludge will be \nused as fertilizer in Quanlin Paper Mill\u2019s reed (a material for straw pulp) planting field.  \n \n4.  Linqing City. The existing 30,000 t/d WWTP is sufficient for 25% of the wastewater \ngenerated in the service area, which has 280,000 people. The untreated and improperly treated \nwastewaters  are  discharged  directly  into  the  Weiyun  and  Xiaoyun  canals.  This  subproject \nincludes (i) a 100,000 t/d secondary WWTP; (ii) a 50,000 t/d tertiary water reuse treatment plant; \nand (iii) 12 km of trunk sewer, reuse water piping, and treatment effluent discharge lines. Half of \nthe effluent will be treated further for industrial reuse. Sludge generated from this WWTP will be \ndisposed of in a new municipal landfill to be built under this Project. This proposed subproject is \nexpected to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading in the HRB by more than 12,000 \ntons per year. It also plays an important role in the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. \n \n5.  Shanghe County. The service area has 53,000 people, though the anticipated rapid \ngrowth will result in a threefold increase by the design year of 2015. As this area does not have \na WWTP, the wastewater (15,000 t/d) is discharged into the Dehuixin and Shangzhong rivers. \nThis proposed subproject includes a 40,000 t/d WWTP, 21 km of sewer, and two lift stations. \nShanghe  County  does  not  have  a  sanitary  landfill.  In  the  short  term,  the  sludge  will  be \ncomposted, and then used as fertilizer in forestry.  \n \n6.  With  an  average  COD  removal  rate  of  75%,  the  proposed  MWM  subprojects  are \nexpected to reduce pollutants in the HRB. Water quality in HRB tributaries might not improve in \nthe short term. However, with other HRB pollution control measures, long-term effects can be \nanticipated. This component will improve local residents\u2019 quality of life and eliminate a source of \npollution to the local groundwater.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \nB.  Industrial Wastewater Management  \n \n7.  Dezhou Changyuan Paper Mill. Changyuan Paper Mill produces 65,000 tons per year \nof  straw  pulp.  With  the  mill\u2019s  outdated  ammonia  cooking  method,  the  valuable  cooking \nchemicals cannot be reused. The current treatment method for the spent chemicals, called \nblack liquor, is inefficient and ineffective. The WWTP for the midsection wastewater is unreliable, \nand would not meet the stringent standards after 2007. The black liquor and other wastewater \nthat cannot be treated are stored in a large unlined storage lagoon or discharged without proper \ntreatment. This lagoon is a major source of groundwater contamination. This subproject consists \nof (i) a 1,800 cubic meter per day (m3/day) black liquor recovery system with 200 t/d solid \ncapacity and 43 t/d sodium hydroxide recovery; (ii) a 45,000 m3/day WWTP; and (iii) a 15,000 \nm3/day process water recycling system. The proposed subproject is expected to eliminate a \nsignificant amount of pollutants (approximately 1,550 tons per year of COD) discharged into the \nHRB. Further, more efficient reuse of the black liquor saves energy and valuable materials. The \nwastewater  storage  lagoon  will  be  closed  within  6  months  after  the  start  of  project \nimplementation. Proper closure of the lagoon will be a loan assurance, eliminating this long-term \ngroundwater pollution source. \n \n8.  Gaotang Quanlin Paper Mill. Quanlin Paper Mill employs 11,000 people and produces \n350,000 tons per year of straw pulp. The black liquor generation rate (6,580 t/d) is projected to \ndouble when a new 300,000 ton-per-year wood pulp production line is added in 2007. The \ncurrent black liquor pretreatment involves an outdated technology, which adds sulfuric acid to \nextract lignin to use as pellet fertilizer. This process destroys alkali that otherwise could be \nrecovered, and consumes large quantities of sulfuric acid. The resulting wastewater contains \nextremely high concentrations of salts, which typical wastewater treatment processes cannot \nremove. Discharge of this treatment effluent into rivers would increase the salt contents in the \nreceiving water bodies greatly, gradually rendering the river water unuseable for irrigation. The \nblack liquor pretreatment (i.e., acidic lignin extraction) process requires high maintenance, and \nthe extracted lignin cannot be reused readily. As such, Quanlin Paper Mill also has a large \nunlined storage lagoon to hold the unused lignin slurry. This lagoon is a major continuous \nsource of groundwater contamination. This subproject consists of (i) an 11,470 m3/day black \nliquor recovery system with 2,440 t/d of solid capacity, (ii) a 536 t/d sodium hydroxide recovery, \nand  (iii)  a  485  t/d  lime  recovery  system  and  accessories.  This  subproject  is  expected  to \neliminated a significant amount of regulated pollutants (292,200 tons per year of COD) and \n200,000 tons per year of unregulated inorganic salts. Recovery of alkali will save valuable \nresources, while greatly reducing the quantity of wastewater. Reducing the unregulated salts \nfrom  the  wastewater  treatment  effluent  has  invaluable  environmental  benefits.  The \nImplementing Agency (IA) has developed a plan to close the lignin storage lagoon properly by \nJune 2006.  \n \nC.  Solid Waste Management \n \n9.  Linqing City. The existing solid waste landfill is an unlined open dump off a main road. \nIndustrial and municipal wastes are dumped without control or daily cover. Leachate, as well as \nodors  and  pests  generated  from  this  dumpsite,  present  significant  threats  to  the  local \ngroundwater, nearby residents, and the environment. The contamination of groundwater, a \nmajor drinking water source, has negative impacts on many more residents in the area. This \nsubproject includes (i) a new lined landfill, (ii) leachate collection and treatment systems, and (iii) \nassociated machinery and equipment. Design life of the landfill is 15 years with a 400 t/d \ncapacity. A low-cost early leak detection system will be considered in the design. If necessary\u2014 \n ", "  Appendix 5  35 \nif liner failure occurs, for example\u2014this system can be converted into a leachate extraction and \ngroundwater remediation system. The old landfill will be closed by the end of 2007.  \n \n10.  Linyi County.  Linyi County is using a temporary unlined open dump to dispose of its \nsolid waste. This open dump, which has been in use for approximately 2 years, is reaching its \ncapacity. Wastes are dumped without control or daily cover. This subproject includes (i) a new \nlined landfill, (ii) leachate collection and treatment systems, and (iii) associated machinery and \nequipment. Design life of the landfill is 20 years with a 200 t/d capacity. The proposed flood \nprotection measure will satisfy the 50-year frequency flood requirements, and will include a low-\ncost early leak detection system in the design. Groundwater elevations are relatively high, \napproximately 3 meters below ground surface. The old landfill will be closed within 1 year from \nthe date the proposed landfill begins operation.  \n \n11.  Zouping  County.  Zouping\u2019s  solid  waste  landfill  is  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the \nselected new site. It is a single-lined, simplified sanitary landfill with a leachate collection system. \nHowever, it does not have leachate treatment system. This subproject includes (i) a new 400 t/d \ncapacity  lined  landfill,  (ii)  a  100  t/d  transfer  station,  (iii)  leachate  collection  and  treatment \nsystems, and (iv) associated machinery and equipment. Design life of the landfill is 15 years. \nThe average elevation of the selected site is slightly lower than the 100-year flood warning \nelevation. With the proposed protective dikes outside the landfill perimeter, however, the flood \ncontrol requirement will be satisfied. As in the other two SWM subprojects, a low-cost early leak \ndetection system will be included in the design. Proper closure of the old landfill has been \nincluded in this Project. Because of the proximity of the new and the existing landfills, they can \nshare a leachate treatment system. \n \n12.  Pollution reduction to HRB will be indirect, but with long-term effects. Clean development \nmechanism and greenhouse gas initiatives will be pilot-tested in the three SWM subprojects. \n \n13.  Investments have been determined based on feasibility studies for each subproject, \nprepared  by  high-quality  domestic  design  institutes,  after  analysis  of  technical  options  for \ntechnology, capacity, location, etc., to determine least-cost solutions. International consultants \nalso reviewed and analyzed the feasibility studies. The project design is technically sound and \ndraws on best sanitary engineering practice.  \n \n \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \nFLOW OF FUNDS AND ONLENDING ARRANGEMENTS \n \nAsian Development \n \nBank \n \n \nADB Loan ($80 million) \nMinistry of Finance  \n(on behalf of the Government) \nDirect Payment \nto Suppliers, \nRelending notes \nConsultants, and \nContractors \nShandong Provincial Government\nMunicipal \nGovernments \nADB/counterpart funds \nADB repayment \nLocal bank funds/user charges  Subloan \nLocal bank repayments \nCounty/City Governments \nSubloan \nMWMs, SWMs, and  \nPaper Mills \nCompany  User Charges \nRevenues \nNote: ADB funds will be onlent on the same terms and conditions as those received by \nMinistry of Finance for MWM and SWM subprojects.

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national priority in    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \ncountry poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty   \n    No  partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People Republic of China (PRC): \n \nThe Project will improve municipal and industrial wastewater collection and treatment, and solid waste management, in \nseven counties and cities of Shandong Province. This, in turn, will reduce surface and groundwater pollution and improve \nthe urban environment and public health, and increase the quality of life of project beneficiaries. In addition, the Project \nwill (i) increase employment and income-generating opportunities, (ii) increase the yield and value of irrigated crops, and \n(iii) reduce risks of paper mills closure. The Project will benefit more than 3.9 million people in the project area, including \n2.2 million in the direct project area and 1.7 million in the indirect project area. Of the beneficiary population, 6.5% live \nbelow the local poverty line. The poverty and social analysis shows that the Project will help to (i) improve wastewater \nand solid waste facilities and services; (ii) reduce air, surface, and groundwater pollution; (iii) reduce risks of exposure to \ndisease vectors; (iv) increase employment opportunities and income-generating activities; (v) reduce risks of people \nfalling into poverty due to closure of paper mills; and (vi) improve urban living environment and increase quality of life. \n \nThe effluent reuse of the treated wastewater is expected to provide water for irrigation and industrial use in the project \nareas. As a result, environmental and socioeconomic benefits will be generated for the local population. The poor, due to \ntheir higher vulnerability to environmental conditions and lack of financial resources, will benefit disproportionately from \nimproved environmental quality and health benefits. A health impact analysis was conducted to determine an indicative \nestimate of the health benefits associated with the Project. Available information on the health status of the project \npopulation was derived from the socioeconomic survey conducted by Shandong Provincial Statistical Bureau in March \n2005, as well as the latest secondary information from provincial and city/county health bureaus. The analysis shows that \nthe population exposed to waterborne-related disease and medical costs will be reduced, and the number of school days \nand workdays lost due to sickness will also be reduced. (A detailed health impact assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix J.)  However, for the full benefit to be realized, other improvements will be required, including (i) parallel \nimprovements in public health education; (ii) higher standard of personal hygiene; and (iii) disease prevention control, \nparticularly for the poor who are likely to suffer from the incidence of pollution-related diseases. \n \nA survey of towns (1,200 respondents) was undertaken to assess the demand for improved wastewater and solid waste \nmanagement services. The overwhelming majority of cities/counties strongly supported the Project. The Project will \ncreate a number of employment opportunities for the local community for construction, particularly for the poor. The \nProject  will require an estimated 13,940 person-months of employment, including 5,360 person-months of direct \nemployment and 8,577 person-months of indirect and induced employment opportunities for local people. About 40% of \nthe unskilled jobs will be provided to the poor and women. The type of jobs for unskilled labor include leveling land, \nexcavation for foundation, soil and earth transportation, construction, etc. The operation of the Project will create 2,360 \nfull-time jobs, including 910 direct jobs and 1,450 indirect and induced jobs. Most of the unskilled jobs will go to the poor \nand women, such as drivers, garbage collectors, sweepers, etc.   \n \nThe reduced risks of Changyuan and Quanlin paper mills closure due to failure to meet wastewater discharge standards \nstipulated by the State Environmental Protection Agency after 1997 will benefit 12,320 employees of both companies and \naround 1.3 million farmers of raw materials. This, in turn, will prevent the income loss of CNY143 million of the paper \nmill\u2019s employees and CNY1, 242 million for the raw material suppliers. In addition, the industrial wastewater treatment of \npaper mill also will reduce the associated risk of business closures in the surrounding areas of the paper mills as a result \nof the paper mills shutting down. As a result, the Project will prevent the possibility of mill workers, raw material suppliers, \nand associated business employees falling into poverty. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) does not have an official urban poverty line. The National Bureau of Statistics  \ndiagnostic urban poverty line was CNY1,875 income per capita in 2000. In 2002, the urban poverty rate in the PRC \nreached 4.1% or 19.6 million, excluding the poor floating population of 40 million. The PRC also has other urban poverty \nlines  set as benchmarks,  below which a person is entitled to  poverty relief  benefits under  the minimum living standard  \n ", "  Appendix 11  45 \nscheme  (MLSS). The city government has primary responsibility for financial assistance to the urban poor under MLSS. \nEach city sets its own poverty or benefit line, which is adjusted periodically.  \n \nIn 2003, Shandong Province\u2019s population was 91.25 million, which included 1.12 million (or 1.2% of the population) living \nbelow the MLSS. The poverty ratio in the eight project areas (Binzhou, Changyuan, Gaotang, Linqing city, Linyi city, \nQuanlin, Shanghe, and Zouping) ranges from 2.9% in Changyuan and to 14.4% in Shanghe. The average poverty ratio is \n6.5%. Shandong Province has 10 national poverty counties and 20 provincial poverty counties, and Shanghe is a \ndesignated county. All the project counties have higher poverty ratios than the provincial poverty ratio (6.5% versus \n1.2%). The MLSS ranges from CNY1,440 per capita per year in Shanghe to CNY2,040 per capita per year in Quanlin \nand Gaotang. Since city government sets its own poverty or benefit line, poorer cities tend to use a severe definition of \npoverty and richer cities a more lenient definition.   \n \nThe socioeconomic survey showed that most of the urban poor are unemployed workers, part-time workers, disabled \npeople, and old and retirees without any family members. The primary cause of urban poverty has been the loss of \nemployment due to downsizing of state-owned enterprises and limited opportunities for alternative income-earning \nactivities. Urban poverty is often reinforced by environmental pollution at the household level. The poor could not afford \nthe service of basic infrastructure and facilities, such as clean water, wastewater, and solid waste services, and had less \nability to cope with pollution and a degraded environment. They often suffer from serious water supply shortages, poor \nwater quality, wastewater pollution, and poor urban environmental sanitation, which increase their exposure to water and \nair pollution. This puts them at high risk for diseases related to water and air pollution, such as diarrhea, hepatitis, and \nrespiratory diseases. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nStakeholder analysis was conducted during the poverty and social analysis (PSA). Various methods and approaches \nhave  been  employed,  including  PSA,  random  sampling  socioeconomic  survey  (1,200  respondents),  stakeholder \nconsultation meetings and workshops, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The main stakeholder \ngroups are (i) urban and rural residents; (ii) beneficiary communities; (iii) industrial/commercial users; (iv) business \nconsumers; (v) downstream irrigation farmers; (vi) paper mill employees and management; (vii) local decision makers, \nincluding relevant government agencies at provincial city/county levels; (viii) project management office; (ix) project \nimplementation agencies; and (x) private sector. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA public education and awareness program (PEAP) will be conducted to promote hygiene education, recycling program, \nand social acceptance of tariff increases.a  The following results are expected through the PEAP: (i) increased \nparticipation of the local population in project implementation and monitoring, (ii) increased awareness of project benefits \nand acceptance of the Project, (iii) increased hygiene knowledge and reduced incidence of water- and vector-borne \ndiseases, and (iv) increased participation of beneficiaries in the garbage recycling programs as part of solid waste \nmanagement program. Furthermore, stakeholder consultation and disclosure of information on the implementation of the \nresettlement plan (RP) and environmental management plan will be conducted during project implementation.   \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe health benefits would be greater for women, elderly, children, and the poor, as they are most vulnerable to such \ndiseases. With more chances of contact with water from domestic chores, women will benefit disproportionately from the \nimprovement in water quality and urban environment. Women also will benefit from the Project due to the employment \nopportunities during construction and operations. Furthermore, 15% of women employees in the two industrial paper \nmills and 20% of women raw material suppliers could maintain their employment opportunities, thus not fallling into \npoverty level due to paper mill closures. \n \nWomen in the community will be engaged actively for the PEAP to promote (i) hygiene education, (ii) garbage recycling, \nand (iii) social acceptance of tariff increases. For the PEAP, the Project will work closely with local women\u2019s \norganizations, such as All Chinese Women Association and women\u2019s street committee. The project performance \nmanagement system, RP, and environmental management plan will include gender disaggregated data, where relevant. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Background \n \n1.  The Project has nine components in Bizhou, Dezhou, Jinan, and Liaocheng, municipalities. \nSeven of the components have land acquisition and resettlement impacts. The others, which involve \nimproved  waste  management  for  two  paper  mills,  have  sufficient  land  for  construction.  The \nresettlement planning, and implementation is designed to ensure that the affected persons will be \nbetter off, or at least not worse off, as a result of the Project.  \n \nB.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  The impacts of the Project are summarized in Table A12. Land acquisition and resettlement \nwill affect seven villages. The Project will acquire about 101.5 hectares (ha) of land, 37% of which is \nclassified as cultivated farmland. Permanent land acquisition will affect approximately 610 people in \n123 households and three enterprises. The Project will require the temporary acquisition of 39 ha of \nland. No households will need to be relocated. About 30,450 square meters (m2) of structures will be \ndemolished, most of which are old abandoned buildings belonging to the Yinhe Paper Mill in Linqing \nCity. Two brick kilns will be closed due to environmental regulations effective 2004. The Zouping \nsolid waste management (SWM) component will affect a state-owned farm, and the 27 workers have \nbeen transferred to the SWM plant. Most of the affected people are rural, though many have \ndiversified income sources. Thus, the loss of land is not considered serious. Although temporary \nland occupation due to sewer pipeline construction will affect about 1,441 persons, compensation is \nnot needed because the disturbances will be short and contractors will restore conditions quickly. \n \n3.  To avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, local officials and village street \ncommittees were consulted. \n  \nTable A12: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \nProject  Permanent Land  Temporary  Building  Directly  Directly  Persons \nComponent  Acquisition  Occupation of  Demolition  Affected  Affected  Indirectly \nState-Owned  House-  Persons  Affected by \nTotal  Cultivated  Land  holds  Temporary Land \nLand  Acquisition \n   (ha)  (ha)   (ha)  (m2)  (HH)  (AP)  (AP) \nShanghe MWM  4.66  4.33  6.87  0  52  245  69 \nBinzhou MWM  4.53  3.84  20.63  0  47  185  184 \nGaotang MWM  6.17  2.96  5.48  0  19  76  471 \nLinqing MWM  5.27  0.00  6.00  28,000  0  0  717 \nSubtotal MWM  20.63  11.13  38.98  28,000  118  506  1,441 \nLinqing SWM  18.67  0.00  0.00  450  1 brickfield 26  0 \nLinyi SWM  20.40  0.00  0.00  2,000  1 brickfield 46  0 \n1 farm and \nZouping SWM  41.80  26.67  0.00  0  5 HH  32  0 \nSubtotal SWM  80.87  26.67  0.00  2,450  5  104  0 \nTotal  101.50  37.80  38.98  30,450  123  610  1,441 \nAP = affected person, ha = hectare, HH = household, m2 = square meter, MWM = municipal wastewater management, \nSWM = solid waste management. \nSource: Resettlement plans, by county government implementing agencies. June 2005.      \n \n \n \n   \n ", "48     Appendix 12 \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n4.  The compensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (1998) and the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and \nStrictly Enforce Land Administration Document 28 (November 2004). House demolition is based on \nthe  Provincial  and  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolition  Administration  Regulations.  Seven \nresettlement plans (RP) were prepared to comply with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement. Based on consultations with local governments and those affected, the \nrespective implementing agencies (IA) adopted compensation standards based on the replacement \ncost. The resettlement principles established for the Project are (i) land acquisition and involuntary \nresettlement should be avoided, where feasible, by developing and comparing design alternatives; \n(ii) compensation and entitlements provided are based on market/replacement value and must be \nadequate  to  allow  those  affected  to  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  standard  of  living,  with \nimprovement; (iii) land temporarily occupied and the period for disruption are to be minimized; (iv) all \naffected people, legal and illegal, are to be accounted for; (v) per capita landholding after land \nacquisition  will  be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood  standard;  (vi) other  income-\ngenerating activities will be provided where land allocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the \nprevious livelihood standards; (vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups in \ncompensation,  housing,  transfer,  and  employment;  (viii)  all  those  affected  will  be  adequately \ninformed  about  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and  standards,  livelihood  and  income-restoration \nplans, and project timing; and (ix) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to resolve \nany problems.  \n \n5.  For land acquisition, part of the compensation will be paid to the affected village and the \nresettlement subsidy will be paid to the affected households. For enterprises, compensation will be \npaid to owners. The payment will be made in cash, according to the appraised value of the property. \nCompensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets also will be paid directly to affected \nfarmers. Income losses resulting from reduced production/sales and wages caused by the Project \nwill be compensated in cash. \n \nD.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation  \n \n6.  The  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  the  restoration  of  livelihood  and  income.  The \nrespective project implementation units, IAs, and local government will assistance with the relocation \nof two brick kilns. No individual residential building will be demolished. \n \n7.  The  economic  rehabilitation  measures  include  (i)  providing  jobs  during  the  project \nconstruction  and  operational  phases;  (ii)  arranging  for  those  affected  to  be  employed  in  local \nenterprises and businesses; (iii) redistributing land, where possible; (iv) intensifying and diversifying \nfarm operations to raise the value of production and income per unit of land; (v) supporting animal \nbreeding  income-generating  activities;  (vi)  promoting  and  developing  new  enterprises  and  self-\nemployed tertiary businesses (i.e., transportation, entertainment, and catering services); and (vii) \ntraining  in  scientific  and  diversified  agricultural  business,  technology  on  animal  husbandry  and \neconomic crops planting, and technology on planting vegetables in greenhouses to help affected \npeople increase their incomes. The compensation paid to village committees will be used to improve \nvillage  production  and  infrastructure.  For  affected  small-scale  enterprises,  the  IA  will  reemploy \naffected employees, or they will be provided assistance to secure other jobs. \n \n8.  The survey identified two vulnerable households (three persons) for the Shanghe municipal \nwastewater management (MWM) project. For the vulnerable people, the project management office \n(PMO) will establish a special CNY50,000 fund for them to improve their living standards. The \ncounty civil affairs bureau will manage the fund. The IA will supervise implementation to ensure \n ", "  Appendix 12  49 \nthese vulnerable persons receive adequate compensation, special fund, and assistance to restore \ntheir living conditions and incomes. \n \nE.  Resettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n \n9.  The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is $8.75 million, equivalent to CNY71 \nmillion  in  2005  prices,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement cost is included as part of project cost. According to the compensation policies and \nstandards defined in the RP, the internal monitoring agencies will supervise the payment and usage \nof compensation funds, while the external monitoring agency will conduct regular reviews. Detailed \nmeasurement surveys will be conducted in each village and enterprise, and the compensation \ncontracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, households, and enterprises. \n \nF.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n \n10.  The people affected have been notified about the key elements of the RP, and results of \ncommunity  consultations  have  been  integrated  into  the  RPs.  The  draft  RPs,  or  Resettlement \nInformation Booklets (RIB), were disseminated to affected households and village offices in April \n2005. The revised RIBs were disclosed to affected households on 15 August 2005. The RPs were \nposted in village offices and resident committees on 15 August 2005, and on the ADB Web site on 8 \nDecember 2005.  The IAs will establish project resettlement units for (i) supervising implementation, \n(ii) continuing public consultation, (iii) monitoring progress, and (iv) responding to grievances. The \ngrievance address procedures are well established and included in the RPs. \n   \nG.  Institutional Responsibilities  \n \n11.  The provincial PMO will be responsible for overseeing project implementation. Each project \nimplementation unit and IA will have at least two full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement,  respectively.  The  staff  from  each  component  resettlement  unit  will  have  primary \nresponsibility  for  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  monitoring  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement. They will work closely with relevant village officials, land administration \nbureaus, and house demolishment offices. Further, they will be responsible for supervising and \nmonitoring  resettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  restoration  of  incomes,  provision  of \nreplacement  land,  and  other  economic  measures).  A  resettlement  training  workshop  for  local \ngovernment officials, local land departments, and IAs was conducted in Jinan on 28 July 2005. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n12.  RP implementation will be monitored internally and externally. Monitoring methodologies are \nspecified in the RPs. Each IA will conduct internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance \nwith the provisions of the RP. The PMO and IAs have agreed to a set of supervision milestones with \nADB to ensure timely implementation of resettlement activities. The provincial PMO and IAs will \nengage an independent agency for semiannual monitoring in the first year, and annual evaluation of \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  until  2  years  after  the  completion  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \nI.  Resettlement Milestones  \n \n13.  Resettlement  implementation  will  be  scheduled  to  precede  the  subproject  construction \nschedules. Most resettlement activities will begin in April 2006. Resettlement will be completed \nbefore component construction.  \n \n ", "50      Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  financial  analyses  of  municipal  wastewater  management  (MWM),  solid  waste \nmanagement  (SWM),  and  industrial  wastewater  management  (IWM)  subprojects  were \nundertaken in accordance with the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of \nInvestment Projects Financed by Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Framework for the \nEconomic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects of ADB.1 The financial \nanalysis of the Project was undertaken in conjunction with the institutional analysis (Appendix 2). \n \nB.  Financial Analysis Methodology \n \n2.  The  financial  analysis  established  the  requirements  for  financial  sustainability.  It \nmeasured the ability of each subproject to generate sufficient revenues from operations to meet \nall company costs, including operation and maintenance (O&M), debt servicing (ADB loan), \ndepreciation, and a reasonable rate of return on investment. The analysis incorporated the \nrequired  tariff  increases  into  the  financial  model,  and  compared  these  with  affordability  of \nhouseholds, in line with the Government policy of full cost recovery for the MWM and SWM \nsectors. The base case model compared each subproject financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nwith the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess \nthe impact of changes in O&M costs and revenues. \n \n3.  Financial projections (balance sheet, and income and cash flow statements) have been \ndeveloped  for  each  of  the  MWM  and  SWM  companies  based  on  projected  operational \nperformance of the subprojects and the impact of any existing assets. The financial analysis is \nbased on incremental cash flow effects from the Project (Supplementary Appendix L). For IWM \nsubprojects,  financial  projections  have  taken  into  account  the  existing  operations,  project \nfacilities\u2019 operations, and planned future investments.2 \n \nC.  Definitions and Assumptions \n \n4.  All analysis was conducted in real terms at 2005 prices. The FIRR was calculated for the \nMWM and SWM subprojects3 using incremental annual cash flows over 25 years (in line with \ndebt repayment). Project assets were assumed to be fully depreciated at the end of the 25-year \nperiod, leaving zero residual value. The new SWM companies are assumed to integrate all \nSWM  operations\u2014  from  collection,  transport,  disposal,  and  treatment\u2014upon  project \ncompletion.4 \n \n5.  Project  capital  expenditures  are  estimated  based  on  the  proposed  implementation \nschedule, and include physical contingencies of 8% for civil works and 5% for equipment and \n                                                 \n1 ADB 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \nManila. \n2 The IWM subproject is non-revenue generating. However, because it will result in financial cost savings to the \ncompanies, \u201cpseudo-FIRR\u201d was estimated to determine the impact of these savings on the Project. \n3  All companies are assumed to be fully operational upon project completion and commissioning. The Gaotang \nMWM component will be under the existing Gaotang WWTP company, while new companies have been formed for \nBinzhou MWM, Shanghe MWM, Linqing MWM, Linyi SWM, Linqing SWM, and Zouping SWM.  \n4  This was confirmed with the IAs based on the need to integrate the collection, transport, disposal, and treatment for \nmore cost-efficient operations. Currently, the Environmental Sanitation Department (ESD) in Linqing county is in \ncharge of SWM operations, but needs to integrate with village communities to ensure efficient collection. In \nZouping, the ESD is in charge of landfill operations and the City Administration Bureau is in charge of secondary \ncollection and transport to landfill, with village communities being in charge of primary collection. In Linyi county, \nESD does all SWM collection. \n ", "  Appendix 13  51 \nmaterial. O&M costs include only incremental costs incurred under the Project. Revenues for \nthe MWM and SWM subprojects are calculated as a function of MWM/SWM generated volumes, \ntariff rates, and tariff collection efficiencies. Tariffs have been calculated to cover all costs as \nwell as provide a reasonable rate of return (1\u20133%). The base case assumes an improvement in \ntariff collection rates from 75% in 2006 to 95% in 2011. This is reasonable since the Project will \nhelp  improve  (i)  service  delivery,  (ii)  efficiency  gains,  (iii)  tariff  structuring,  (iv)  billing \ntransparency, (v) consumer participation, and (vi) education and awareness of tariff increases. \n \n6.  During  construction,  wastewater  and  solid  waste  tariffs  will  cover  all  O&M  and \ndepreciation.5  By 2010, when loan repayment begins, tariffs need to cover debt service, and \nlocal governments will need adequate tariff increases or subsidies to sustain the service levels.  \n \n7.  The WACC varies based on the ADB loan and local government equity contributions for \neach subproject. With an overall ADB project loan share of 49.9% and IAs share of 50.1%, the \noverall project WACC is 3.4%. The cost of ADB funds is calculated at 4.66% London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR) plus 60 basis points spread, except for the first year, where a 20 basis \npoints discount is applied). Additionally, 0.2% (for the MWM and SWM subprojects) and 0.5% \n(IWM subprojects) have been added to the ADB cost of funds to account for the service fee that \nShandong Provincial Finance Bureau (SPFB) will charge to the subproject IAs.6 The cost of \nlocal government funds is assumed to be 6.03%.7  \n \n8.  International inflation is estimated at 1.9%, while domestic inflation is estimated at 2.5% \nin 2005, 2.6% in 2006, 2.8% in 2007, and 3% thereafter. Depreciation is assumed at 2.5% for \ncivil works and 5% for equipment. The ADB loan repayment period is 25 years (with a 5-year \ngrace period) for MWM and SWM subprojects, and 12 years (with a 4-year grace period) for \nIWM subprojects. \n  \nD.  Results \u2013 MWM Subprojects \n9.  FIRRs  exceed  the  WACC,  indicating  financial  viability  of  MWM  subprojects  (Table \nA13.1). Sensitivity tests show that the Shanghe subproject is most vulnerable to a decrease in \nrevenues. A combined 10% revenue decrease and 10% cost increase, or a revenue decrease \nby 20% alone, has an adverse affect on all the subprojects and would require further tariff \nincreases or short-term subsidies from the local governments.  \n \n10.  The  MWM  subprojects  are  sustainable,  and  key  ratios  for  2010  (Table  A13.2)  are \nconsidered adequate. With tariff collection rates rising to 80% after project completion, focus on \nservice delivery is considered critical to financial sustainability of the MWM companies.  \n \nE.  Results \u2013 SWM Subprojects \n11.  The Linyi, Linqing, and Zouping SWM subprojects have indicated their willingness to \nincorporate the clean development mechanism (CDM).

The  financial  analysis  of  the  pollution  control  investments  for  the  paper  mills  was \nundertaken  based  on  financial  soundness,  as  the  project  investments  will  not  generate \nadditional  revenues  directly.  Financial  soundness  was  measured  in  terms  of  the  minimum \nthresholds for debt service coverage, and current and quick ratio of its operations. Though the \nIWM subproject is non-revenue generating, it provides cost savings to the company. As such, a \n\u201cpseudo-FIRR\u201d was calculated to determine the financial viability of the investment. The base \ncase FIRR of 16.9% exceeds the WACC of 3.8% for Quanlin IWM, while the FIRR of 9.60% \nexceeds the WACC of 3.95% for Changyuan.

The SWM subprojects achieve partial recovery of O&M and depreciation during project \nimplementation due to asset revaluation by Environmental Sanitation Department (ESDs) and \ncity administration units, and full accounting of actual cost of SWM services. During this period, \na gradual shift to integrated collection, transport, disposal, and treatment will be developed, and \nsynchronized with transparent SWM fee collection schemes in the service areas. Costs will be \ncompared with SWM revenues received by the Finance Bureau to determine the appropriate \nlevels of subsidy required for SWM, if collected user fees are inadequate. Tariff reforms will be \nundertaken in conjunction with corporatization11 to ensure the synergy of managerial autonomy, \nsector reengineering, and integration of SWM functions.  \n \n16.  The calculated wastewater full cost recovery tariffs (starting from 2010) were tested \nagainst the affordability of low-income and average-income households.12 The proposed tariff is \naffordable for both groups, with the combined monthly water and wastewater bill accounting for \n2.5%  of  the  income  of  average-income  household  and  4.0%  of  that  of  the  low-income \nhouseholds. For the poorest households, the city/county governments provide minimum living \nstandard schemes, which include a provision for lifeline utility services. The counties and cities \nalso provide rebates on water/wastewater bills to all households qualifying for social assistance \nwith the recent increase in water and wastewater tariffs. \n \n17.  The current SWM fees of CNY3\u20135 per household per month do not cover all costs of \nSWM operations due to inefficiencies (multi-agency service provision/tariff collection) and lack \nof full cost accounting. Socioeconomic survey results show higher willingness to pay as long as \nservices are improved. Lower-income groups have an average willingness to pay (WTP) of \nCNY8  per  household. The  average  WTP  per  household  per  month  is  CNY8.0  in  Linqing, \nCNY7.5 in Linyi, and CNY7.5 in Zouping.  \n \n18.  Therefore, the analysis requires that SWM fees be gradually increased before project \ncommissioning to CNY8 per household per month by 2008, and a full cost recovery level of \nCNY10 per household per month in 2010, when project facilities are operational and debt \nrepayments begin. This is still within the affordability limits of CNY11 for the lowest-income \ngroup and average CNY16 for average-income groups. The proposed SWM fees account for \naround 0.5\u20130.7% of the income of an average-income family and around 1% of the low-income \nfamily (Table A13.5). As envisaged, rising income levels will benefit the affordability of the \nlower- and middle-income groups, impacting their willingness to pay and allowing for tariff \nincreases. Concurrently, SWM companies need to bring in efficiencies in fee collections, service \nstandards, and effective tariff mechanisms. \n                                                 \n11  Refer to footnote 14 in the maintext. \n12  Defined as the households earning for the average of the lowest 10th percentile of income distribution. \n ", "  Appendix 14   55 \nSUMMARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  e economic analysis covers the Shandong Hai River Basin (HRB) Pollution Control \nProject (the Project) and its subprojects. For the overall Project, the analysis covers (i) the \neconomic rationale for public intervention, (ii) the goals of the investment plan, and (iii) the \ndesign of the plan. The economic analysis also evaluates the subprojects relative to least-cost \nanalysis criteria and standard benefit-cost analysis. The technical description of the Project, with \nits outputs and impacts, are in Appendix 5. The detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix M. \n \nB.  Analysis of the Overall Project \n \n2.  2.  Rationale  for  Public  Intervention.  The  Project  is  the  fourth  in  a  series  of \nenvironmental pollution improvements financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to manage water quality in the HRB. The HRB is considered \none of the PRC\u2019s most polluted basins, with more than 80% of river bodies failing to meet their \ntargeted water quality. ADB-funded projects have (i) helped develop and refine the national \nHRB  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Plan  (HRB  Plan),  (ii)  financed  activities  in  Tianjin \nmunicipality and Hebei Province (ongoing), and (iii) assisted with the preparation of a sector \nproject in Henan Province.1  \n \n3.  3.  The HRB is one of three river basins and three lake basins in the PRC with the \nhighest priority for improving water quality. It includes about 120 million people, and intersects \nfour provinces (Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong) and two provincial-level cities (Beijing \nand Tianjin). The Shandong HRB (SHRB) includes 26 counties/municipalities/districts with 15.5 \nmillion people. The project area located in the northwestern part of Shandong Province is within \nthe HRB, and covers approximately 26,000 square kilometers (km2) and four municipalities \n(Binzhou, Dezhou, Jinan, and Liaocheng). The SHRB consists of two river systems\u2014the Zhang-\nWei-Nan and Tuhai-Majia systems. \n \n4.  4.  The  HRB  Plan  involves  government  intervention  at  central,  provincial,  and \nmunicipal levels. Government involvement is justified at each level in controlling the externalities \nfrom discharges of untreated wastewater, as well as managing surface water quality in a more \ncoordinated manner. Central Government involvement is justified since the HRB spans several \nprovinces and cities. Likewise, government involvement in individual projects is justified since \nmunicipal wastewater management (MWM) and solid waste management (SWM) are (i) natural \nmonopolies, (ii) owned by local governments, and (iii) to be managed as independent public \nenterprises. \n \n5.  5.  Similarly, industrial paper mills are state-owned, economically sound enterprises \nthat employ a significant number of people. They provide livelihood opportunities to those \nassociated with the paper mills\u2019 operations (farmers, wholesalers, and retailers), as well as \nconsiderable tax revenues to municipal governments to support local government services.

In Shandong, the World Bank has helped paper mills adopt clean production technology \nand wastewater treatment processes.  \n \n6.  Goals and Design of the HRB Plan. In the PRC, the central and provincial levels have \ngeneral plans for sustaining economic growth and development. These serve as the basis or \neconomic context for the goals specified and detailed in various investment plans. The Tenth 5-\nYear Plan (2001\u20132005) (T5YP) for Shandong Province aims to sustain high economic growth \nrates. The T5YP recognizes the need to address environmental protection, and improve and \nmaintain  environmental  quality  by  meeting  goals  for  surface  water  quality  and  pollutant \nreduction targets specified in the HRB Plan. \n7.  In July 2003, Shandong provincial government (SPG) developed a subsidiary plan\u2014the \nShandong HRB Environmental Protection Plan (SHRB Plan)\u2014for managing water quality in the \npart of the province that is within the HRB. The surface water quality targets identified in the \nSHRB Plan are similar to those in the HRB Plan.2 Municipal and county governments were \nrequired to make investments in wastewater and solid waste management, and to manage the \ncompleted  facilities.  The  SHRB  Plan  is  reasonably  sound  and  integrated  with  the  overall \nplanning process. Moreover, it is in line with the national approach of targeting major point-\nsource polluters as the most cost-effective measure in improving water quality. \n   \n8.  All subprojects in the proposed Project are an integral component in the SHRB Plan, and \nwill contribute to meeting the established water quality targets in the receiving water bodies, and \nin meeting the targets of the HRB Plan: (i) protection of important drinking water sources; (ii) \ncentralized wastewater treatment for protection of Bohai Bay; and (iii) clean production, waste \nminimization, and recycling. The SHRB Plan specifically states that rehabilitation of the Tuhai \nRiver and Majia River are priority projects, and requires that all municipalities and counties take \nappropriate action on pollution control. All proposed subprojects are in the Tuhai\u2013Majia River \nsystem. \n \n9.  9.  Each municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) will be designed at least \ncost,  in  terms  of  location,  scale  (planning  horizon),  and  treatment  technology.  Detailed \nevaluation of options has been undertaken to meet the least-cost criterion.3 The design has \nincorporated three crucial factors: (i) all significant point sources in the surrounding areas were \nto be controlled, (ii) all wastewater generators should face the same effluent charge, and (iii) the \ncharge will approximate the marginal cost of processing wastewater at the municipal WWTP. \nAccording to standard economic theory, these principles can be considered sufficient to provide \neconomic incentives for least-cost management of wastewater across all point sources.4    \n \n                                                 \n2  See Appendix 6 and the main text of this report for several important targets on chemical oxygen demand and \nammonia nitrogen for the project areas. \n3  The least-cost analysis of municipal WWTPs for Binzhou, Gaotang, and Shanghe has compared the technical \nalternatives of an anoxic/oxic (A/O) process, an oxidation ditch, and an intermittent cycle extension aeration system \n(ICEAS) process. The A/O process had the lowest average incremental economic cost (AIEC). For Linqing WWTP, \nthe alternatives examined were the submerged biological filter, the aerated biological filter, and an oxidation ditch. \nThe submerged biological filter had the lowest AIEC. \n4  Hanley, N.J. Shogren, and B. White. 1997. Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice. Oxford University \nPress. \n ", "  Appendix 14   57 \n10.  The  established  environmental  improvement  plans  are  a  reasonable  approach  to \n(i) managing environmental protection and ambient water quality in SHRB, and (ii) planning for \nsustainable  urban  development  at  the  country/cities  in Shandong. The  Project  is  a  critical \ncomponent of the established SHRB Plan, and represents a least-cost approach to achieving \nincremental improvements in environmental quality. Though limited in scope, it achieves public \nsupport through public participation in the planning process, stakeholder consultations, and \nsurveys  undertaken  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  Of  the  800 \nrespondents  in  project  areas,  52%  ranked  MWM  and  SWM  improvements  as  priority \ninvestments. A majority of survey respondents were willing to pay directly for environmental \nfacilities and services.  \n \nC.  Evaluation of Individual Subprojects \n \n11.  In addition to being part of the HRB Plan, each subproject is economically justified on its \nown. Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were estimated for MWM, industrial wastewater \nmanagement  (IWM),  and  SWM  subprojects.  The  EIRRs  were  compared  with  economic \nopportunity cost of capital (EOCC), which was assumed to be 12%. Major economic benefits \nthat were quantified for each component include the following:   \n \n(i)  Municipal wastewater management: (a) tariff revenues paid by nonindustrial and \nindustrial customers; (b) cost savings on environmental cleanup of canals and \nwaterways  by  municipal  governments;  and  (c)  recycled  effluent  (100%  for \nGaotang WWTP, 50% for Linqing WWTP, and 75% for Binzhou WWTP).   \n(ii)  Industrial wastewater management: Direct economic benefits of adopting cleaner \nproduction  technology  include  cost  savings  from  (a)  direct  reduction  of \nconventional pollutants, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical \noxygen demand, and ammonia in their WWTPs; (b) reuse of steam energy and \ncooking  chemicals;  (c)  industrial  reuse  of  the  reclaimed  water,  sparing  good \nquality water for drinking or other domestic uses; and (d) preventing substantial \namounts of unregulated salts from entering the HRB. \n(iii)  Solid waste management: (a) willingness to pay; and (b) cost savings on disease \nprevention/eradication, and environment cleanup. \n \n12.  Economic analysis was conducted over 25 years, including project construction in 2006 \nand  completion  in  2011.  Economic  benefits  and  costs  are  denominated  in  domestic  price \nnumeraire at constant 2005 prices. Foreign currency costs were converted to local currency \ncosts using an exchange rate of CNY8.11 per $1 and adjusted based on purchasing power \nparity  assumption.  Project  tradable  components  were  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using \nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.013 and nontradable components valued at domestic market \nprices. Project costs and benefits were estimated on a without- and with-project basis. Transfer \npayments  were  excluded  in  the  valuation  of  cost  estimates  in  economic  prices.  Standard \nsensitivity tests, and additional tests for 1-year implementation delay and 20% increase in costs, \nwere conducted. Sensitivity indicator (SI) and switching value (SV) were calculated.5 \n \n13.  Municipal  Wastewater  Management.  The  MWM  subprojects  (Binzhou,  Gaotang, \nLinqing, and Shanghe) will improve wastewater collection and treatment systems and effluent \nreuse. Water quality after treatment will meet discharge standards of pollutants for municipal \nwastewater. EIRRs are higher than EOCC of 12%, indicating that the MWM subprojects are \n                                                 \n5 The lower the SV, the more sensitive the NPV is to the change in the variable concerned, and the higher the risk \nwith the Project. \n ", "58     Appendix 14 \neconomically justified.

Industrial Wastewater Management. The Changyuan Paper Mill and Quanlin Paper \nMill subprojects intend to replace the outdated technology of black liquor pretreatment with an \nalkali recovery process, which is a cleaner production technology. The current pollution control \nfacilities  of  these  two  paper  mills  would  not  meet  the  new  standards  that  the  PRC  has \nestablished for paper mills in 2007. The cleaner production processes will reduce the pollutant \nin the final effluent discharge to the rivers, which will enable the paper mills to meet the COD \ntarget of 120 milligrams per liter (mg/l) by 2010 from 400 mg/l in 2005.6  With the new alkali \nrecovery  processes,  wastewater  quantity  will  be  reduced  greatly.  In  addition,  the  unlined \nlagoons  for  treated  black  liquor  and  lignin  storage  will  be  closed,  reducing  the  risks  of \ngroundwater  contamination.  The  paper  mills  are  vital  in  providing  livelihood  to  people \n(employees and their families, farmers, wholesalers/retailers), as well as tax revenues to local \ngovernments. Table A13.2 shows the results of the analysis. With EIRRs higher than the EOCC, \nthe subprojects are economically justified. \n \nTable 14.2: Results of Economic Analysis of IWM Subprojects \n  Changyuan Paper Mill  Quanlin Paper Mill  \nScenario  EIRR  NPV  SI  SV  EIRR  NPV  SI  SV \n(%)  (106  (%)  (106 \nCNY)  CNY) \nBase Case  19.8  66.9      23.9  304.1     \nCase 1: 10% increase in costs  15.9  36.3  4.6  21.8   19.2  191.5  3.7   27.0  \nCase 2: 10% decrease in benefits  15.5  29.6  5.6  17.9   18.7  161.1  4.7  21.3  \nCase 3: 10% increase in costs and                 \n10% decrease in benefits  14.5  21.7  0  0  13.9  48.6  0  0 \nCase  4:  1-year  implementation  19.6  64.0  0  0  23.8  295.2  0  0 \ndelay \nCase 5: 20% increase in costs  12.6  5.6   4.6  21.9  14.9  79.0  3.69  27.0  \n0 = magnitude zero, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = \nswitching value. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n6 The Quanlin subproject is expected to eliminate a significant amount of regulated pollutants (292,200 t/y of COD) \nand 200,000 t/y of unregulated inorganic salts. The Changyuan subproject is expected to eliminate 1,500 COD \ntons. \n ", "  Appendix 14   59 \n15.  Solid Waste Management. Considering the economic growth for the next 15\u201320 years, \nand  the  projected  increase  in  waste  generation,  the  proposed  improvement  in  collection, \ntransport, and disposal will reduce urban pollution in Linyi and Zouping counties and Linqing \ncity.7 Improving SWM services will safeguard and improve public health through the reduction in \nmany of the physical vectors that can transmit diseases (Supplementary Appendix K) .The new \nsanitary landfills with leachate and methane collection will minimize the waste discharge into the \naquifer, reduce groundwater contamination, reduce the greenhouse gases (GHG), and treat \nsolid waste in a more environmentally sound manner. The clean development mechanism \n(CDM)  facility  and  GHG  emission  credits  will  be  pilot  tested.  Appendix  3  describes  the \napplication of the CDM facility for three SWM subprojects, which will encourage foreign private \nsector involvement and provide financial incentives to implementing agencies to enhance (i) \nwaste  collection,  (ii)  landfill  gas  (LFG)  extraction,  and  (iii)  methane  destruction/utilization \n(methane comprises approximately 50% of LFG). Economic analyses were undertaken with the \nCDM facility. Economic benefits were estimated based on willingness to pay per household per \nmonth, households served, cost savings from disease prevention and mitigation costs of local \ngovernments8. The EIRRs calculated for the SWM subprojects were higher than the EOCC. The \nanalysis further indicated that SWM subprojects are feasible under various sensitivity tests. \nBased on SI and SV parameters, the subprojects are more sensitive to a reduction in benefits \nthan an increase in costs.9   \n \nTable A14.3: Results of Economic Analysis of SWM Subprojects \nScenario  Linqing SWM  Linyi SWM  Zouping SWM \n  EIRR  NPV  SI  SV  EIRR  NPV  SI  SV  EIRR  NPV  SI  SV \n  (%)  (106      (%)  (106      (%)  (106     \nCNY)  CNY)  CNY) \n                   22.4  50.4     \nBase Case  21.7  48.2       19.4  23.6      20.0  41.7  1.7  57.9 \nCase 1: 10% increase  19.5  39.7  1.7  56.7  16.8  16.0  3.22  30.98  19.7  36.7  2.7  36.7 \nin costs \nCase 2: 10% decrease in  19.2  34.9  2.7  36.2  16.5  13.6  4.2  23.66  17.5  28.0  0.0  0.0 \nbenefits \nCase 3: 10% increase in costs  17.1  26.4  0.0  0.0  13.9  6.0  0.0  0.0  22.3  48.6  0.0  0.0 \nand 10% decrease in benefits \nCase 4: one-year  21.6  46.4  0.0  0.0  19.3  22.6  0.0  0.0  17.9  33.0  1.7  58.0 \nimplementation delay \nCase 5: Costs increase by  17.5  31.2  1.7  56.7  14.4  8.4  3.2  31.1  12.2  1.0  0.0  0.0 \n20% \nCase 6: WWTP benefits only  12.6  2.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  (35.9)  0.0  0.0         \n \n \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value, \nSWM = solid waste management, WTP = willingness to pay. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7 The subprojects include a new lined landfill, leachate collection and treatment systems, and associated rolling stock \nand equipment. Design life of the landfill is 15 years with a 400 ton per day (t/d) capacity for Linqing city and \nZouping county. Linyi landfill has 20-year life and 200 t/d capacity. Upon completion, the subprojects will improve \nlocal residents\u2019 quality of life. Pollution reduction to HRB will be indirect, but with long-term effects. \n8 Health benefits were estimated but not considered in the EIRR calculations since they are an assumed part of \nwillingness to pay. Health impact relates to deficiencies in SWM, as well as other environmental factors. Mitigation \ncosts of local government are based on annual budget allocation and service area covered. \n9  Except for Linyi SWM, which has an EIRR lower than 12% under case 6 (WTP benefits only). The Linyi subproject \nhas a limited service area and a smaller number of households served compared with other SWM subprojects. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060626172225+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060530161650+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP _May 30 after Pres approval_.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "STI", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \nVice President  C.
