INTRODUCTION \n1.  In line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Second Governance and Anti-Corruption \nAction Plan, the country partnership strategy (CPS) focuses on (i) improving the efficiency and \ntransparency of ADB-related procurement, (ii) strengthening and streamlining public financial \nmanagement, and (iii) piloting an innovative approach to capacity development. To strengthen \nthe plan in Sri Lanka, the Capacity Development Fund (CDF) will be set up as an umbrella fund. \nFunds will be channeled from the CDF for innovative capacity development initiatives1.  \n \n2.  The Government of Sri Lanka identifies in its 10-year development strategy framework \nlimited capacity as a key constraint to more effective development and public sector service \ndelivery. The guiding principles of the technical assistance (TA) are based on the key findings \nand  recommendations  of  an  ADB  report  titled  Capacity  Development  in  South  Asia.2  In \npreparing the proposed technical assistance, officials and representatives of the Public Service \nCommission (an independent authority for public sector recruitment), National Administrative \nReforms Council, Department of External Resources, Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP), \nPostgraduate  Institute  for  Management  of  the  University  of  Sri  Jayewardenepura  were \nconsulted.  This  was  preceded  by  a  consultative  workshop  held  in  May  2008  with  the \nparticipation of the Ministries of Finance and Planning, Plan Implementation, Power and Energy, \nPublic Administration, Highways, and Water Resources, as well as the Road Development \nAuthority, Ceylon Electricity Board, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, and National \nAdministrative Reforms Council. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In the consultations leading to the CPS, capacity development was identified as needing \nurgent and focused assistance. ADB already provides capacity development linked to projects \nfinanced by it to improve the capacity of sector-specific institutions in ADB priority sectors in Sri \nLanka. However, minimal assistance is currently dedicated to standalone capacity development \ninitiatives for cross-cutting institutions and systems such as the Public Service Commission. \nSuch institutions have not benefited through ADB project funding.  \n \n4.  Capacity development initiatives for the public sector in Sri Lanka are limited and carried \nout by a few state institutions such as the Sri Lanka Institute for Development Administration. \nDedicated funding for institution-specific capacity development initiatives is limited, resulting in \nlow institution-based strategic human resource development. As public employees do not have \na culture of continuous capacity development, a strong incentive is necessary to introduce \ninnovative institution-based capacity development initiatives that are linked to the mandate and \noperational aspects of the institution. Limited allocations for public sector human resources \ndevelopment  is  thinly  spread  across  the  country\u2019s  large  public  sector.  In  instances  where \nexternal funding is available, the perception is that the intervention is driven by donor priorities \nand not necessarily based on local needs. As a result, the effectiveness and sustainability of \ninitiatives are poor for lack of beneficiary ownership. State agencies continue to make various \nformal and informal requests in an ad hoc manner for capacity development. Dedicated funding \nin the form of a CDF would enable those agencies to look at institutional human resources \ndevelopment in a more sustainable and strategic manner. \n                                                 \n1 The Technical Assistance will be listed on Asian Development Bank Business Opportunities in January 2010. \n2 ADB. 2007. Capacity Development in South Asia. ADB Occasional Paper Series No. 1. Manila \n \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The drain of human resources from the state institutions experienced in Sri Lanka, which \nhas added to the problem of low capacity, occurs (i) from the public sector to the private sector \nas people search for better prospects, and (ii) from Sri Lanka to other countries. Provincial \ncapacity  development  is  also  weak  and  needs  strengthening  to  undertake  devolved \nadministrative  functions  under  existing  constitutional  provisions.  Innovative  capacity \ndevelopment initiatives will provide training to existing public officials and be an incentive to \nretain motivated and talented officials. The CDF will be designed so that the target groups are \nobjectively selected based on their ability and continuity in the sector, as well as the direct \nrelevance of the intervention to their official powers and functions, thereby minimizing migration \nfrom public sector institutions benefiting from the CDF. \n \n6.  Capacity improvement is needed throughout the public sector. High-end tasks such as \nstrategic policy formulation and the implementation of highly technical and specialized programs \nis often carried out by people outside the core public service, whose services are retained \nmostly project by project. Their experience is therefore not retained in the institution. On several \noccasions,  the  idea  of  establishing  human  resources  cells  in  each  department  has  been \nconsidered, but it has yet to be implemented. \n \n7.  The CDF will focus attention on capacity issues in the public sector. Funding, though \nrelatively  small,  has  potential  for  high  impact  if  used  strategically  and  in  an  institutionally \nfocused manner. Proposals for intervention will be evaluated against predetermined criteria that \nbring in international best practices contextualized to suit local conditions and needs. In deciding \nbeneficiary institutions, priority will go to those that do not receive direct ADB funding through \neither existing or future projects. The proposed technical assistance will have a discernible \nimpact on national capacity development in three principle ways: (i) developing and publishing \ncriteria based on international best practices to be used to evaluate and select the most suitable \nproposals, (ii) strongly influencing organizations that compete for funding to generate proposals \nthat are innovative and of a high standard, and (iii) funding in phase 1 innovative capacity \ndevelopment interventions in respect of  3\u20135 selected institutions, which then can be studied by \nthe government and its development partners as pilots for formulating a broader strategy. \nInstitutions with mandates related to capacity development or human resource development \nsuch as the Public Service Commission can be prioritized for funding out of the CDF, so that \nimprovements in them have a catalytic effect on improvement in other institutions.     \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA will set up the CDF, which will provide financing for small and medium-scale \nstandalone projects that seek to build capacity in state institutions and, to limited extent, national \nand provincial institutions. The CDF initiative will have two phases, with $1.5 million available for \nphase 1. Depending on progress, ADB will decide in consultation with the government on \nmaking available a further $2 million in 2011. Subject to progress in implementation, additional \nfunding also will be provided by other development partners. In phase 1, the CDF is expected to \ndevelop  the  criteria  for  evaluating  proposals  and  then  fund  3\u20135  capacity  development \ninterventions. An assessment at the end of phase 1 and warranted amendments to operational \ndetails will be made prior to commencing phase 2. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA impact will be improvement in efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery by \nbeneficiary  organizations.  The  envisaged  principal  outcome  of  the  technical  assistance  is \n ", "  3\nincreased  institutional  capacity  for  better  service  delivery.    Enhanced  capacity  in  selected \ninstitutions will contribute to improved public administration and governance through better \nefficiency, service delivery, management of resources and finances, and budget utilization, as \nwell as process reengineering and the development of skills in areas such as strategic thinking \nand leadership. The TA is designed to encourage innovation in capacity development and \ngenerate new ideas by developing a country-specific set of criteria for evaluating innovative \nstrategies for capacity development. In addition, the TA will track the number of women direct \nbeneficiaries and encourage capacity development initiatives that address gender issues in \ninstitutions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outputs of the CDF will be \n(i)  the development of best practices and criteria for capacity development initiatives \nthat will be published and used to evaluate proposals; \n(ii)  the encouragement of competition for funding and, through it, innovation in public \nsector capacity development; and  \n(iii)  the identification, selection, refinement, and funding of capacity development \ninitiatives that contribute to better governance. \n  \n11.  The  CDF  will  develop  criteria  for  assessing  each  proposal.  It  will  specify  which \ncategories of institutions will be eligible for funding. The criteria will be published to set broad \nparameters and infuse international best practice into capacity development in the country. The \nCDF will make available funding for consultant support in assessing capacity needs, developing \ncriteria, guiding the development of proposals, and assisting in refining proposals. The criteria \nwill be contextual and reflect the following principles: \n(i)  The capacity development intervention addresses well-identified capacity gaps. \n(ii)  It demonstrates strong local ownership. \n(iii)  It  has  clearly  identified  and  well-illustrated  positive  incentives  to  ensure \nbeneficiary acceptance and sustainability. \n(iv)  It makes use of existing capacity, and external inputs are integrated with local \npriorities, processes, and systems. \n(v)  Blueprints are avoided, and imported models are suitably amended to suit local \nrequirements and conditions. \n(vi)  The intervention is proposed and promoted by individuals and institutions that \ncan be categorized as prime movers or drivers of change. \n(vii)  The  target  group  is  objectively  selected  based  on  individuals\u2019  ability  and \ncontinuity in the sector, as well as the direct relevance of the intervention to their \nofficial functions. \n(viii)  The intervention promotes transparency, stakeholder participation, inclusiveness, \nand accountability, particularly to the ultimate beneficiaries.3  \n(ix)  It deals with gender imbalances in institutions. \n(x)  It incorporates conflict sensitivity training, particularly in capacity development \ninterventions targeting institutions that work at the grassroots and in lagging \nregions.  \n \n                                                 \n3\n  Based on good capacity development practices contained in ADB. 2007. Capacity Development in South Asia. \nADB Occasional Paper Series No. 1. Manila \n \n ", "4   \n12.  The CDF will create competition among institutions for funding and encourage local \npublic institutions to propose their own strategies for capacity development within the broad \nframework and criteria developed by the CDF. It will provide an avenue for infusing new ideas \nand  best  practices  into  public  sector  capacity  development  through  competition  and  by \nencouraging not only proposals from state institutions but also proposals jointly developed with \nprivate institutions with proven capability in human resource development. The CDF will make \navailable funding for recruiting consultants identified by institutions as necessary to refine and \nimplement their proposal once it is selected. Central and provincial institutions are eligible to \nreceive funds.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The cost of the technical assistance (TA) is estimated at $1.65 million equivalent. ADB \nwill provide $1.5 million equivalent as a grant from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF \n\u2013IV). The government will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent by providing technical and \nlogistical support. ADB Sri Lanka Resident Mission will engage other developmental partners for \nparallel cofinancing.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The CDF will be jointly administered by the MOFP and the Sri Lanka Resident Mission. \nThe MOFP will be the designated executing agency. Proposals for funding will be approved by a \nsteering committee consisting of the secretary of the MOFP as chair, the secretary of the \nMinistry of Public Administration, and the country director of the mission. Proposals will be pre-\nevaluated by a technical committee with representatives of the Department of National Planning, \nthe mission, and the Administrative Reforms Division of the Ministry of Public Administration, as \nwell as a senior representative of the relevant line ministry in the case of department specific \nproposals. Administrative support for the functioning of these committees will be provided by the \nMOFP. The MOFP and ADB will each designate one officer as a principle contact point for this \nTA. The implementing agency of capacity development interventions will be the state entity \nspecific to the selected proposal. The MOFP, as the principal contact point for ADB in its \noperations in Sri Lanka, has long experience in project implementation and management, is \nconversant with ADB guidelines and procedures, and has implemented ADB-funded projects in \nthe past, including TA, with strong accountability and transparency. \n  \n15.  As beneficiary institutions are not expected to have the means to finance the projects \nfrom their own funds, advance payments will be necessary. ADB will provide an advance to the \nMOFP through an advance payment facility in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.4 The MOFP will provide advances in turn to beneficiary institutions \nand be responsible for liquidating the advance. Successive advances will be made by ADB only \nafter liquidation of the prior advances. ADB will assess the capacity of the MOFP for liquidation \nprior to disbursing advances.  \n \n16.  Each selected proposal will have a monitoring and evaluation framework with clear \noutputs and outcomes that is acceptable to ADB and in line with the published criteria of the \nCDF. The implementation of projects funded by the CDF will be monitored regularly to ensure \nthat progress is in line with the original design and that intended outputs and outcomes are \nbeing met.  \n \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008.

The CDF will require consultancy support at two stages: (i) to develop the guidelines for \nevaluating capacity development proposals and provide assistance to the steering committee in \napplying  the  guidelines  and  (ii)  to  support  beneficiary  institutions\u2019  refinement  and  further \ndevelopment  of  their  proposals.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  services  of  two  consultants,  one \ninternational  and  one  national,  will  be  required  to  develop  the  criteria.  The  international \nconsultant will be engaged for 1 person-month and the local consultant for 24 person-months. \nBoth consultants will be required to have expertise in human resource development in the public \nsector and experience in implementing capacity development programs. The national consultant \nwill need a sound knowledge of public sector administrative processes. Additional consultancy \nservices will be procured as necessary for selected proposals, one consultant for each. The \nexpertise  required  of  these  consultants  will  depend  on  the  type  of  proposal.  The  national \nconsultant will oversee the implementation of the TA for the entire period of its implementation. \nSLRM will be responsible for the recruitment of all consultants as required for the TA and \nsubprojects in line with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time), with 10%\u201315% of the consultancy cost for the international consultant. The TA will \ncommence in January 2010 and be implemented for 2 years. Disbursements under the TA will \nbe made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (footnote 3). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.
