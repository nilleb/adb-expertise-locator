Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) are generally dispersed and remote, with \nfragile environments, small and scattered populations, and face similar challenges. They are \nhighly vulnerable to climate-related natural hazards, which adversely affect livelihoods and \neconomies.  The  Pacific  countries  are  being  supported  in  their  efforts  toward  sustainable \ndevelopment, including addressing climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction \n(DRR),  through  a  regional  strategic framework,  including  (i)  the  Pacific  Plan,  2005,  which \nprovides a framework for strengthening regional cooperation and integration, to address climate \nchange;1 (ii) the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change, 2006\u20132015;2 and \n(iii) the Pacific Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Management Framework for Action, 2005\u2013\n2015  (Regional  Framework),  which  provides  overarching  policy  guidance  for  disaster  risk \nmanagement and support for building climate-resilient communities.3 \n \n2.  Based on the recommendations of an independent expert group, the Pacific has been \ninvited as one of two vulnerable regions (the Caribbean being the other) to participate in the \nPilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) under the Strategic Climate Fund, a multi-donor \ntrust fund within the Climate Investment Funds. The PPCR aims to help countries transform to a \nclimate-resilient development path, consistent with national poverty reduction and sustainable \ndevelopment goals.4 This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) is intended \nto support implementation.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Despite the many initiatives in CCA and DRR in the Pacific region, there has been slow \nprogress  towards  achieving  more  climate-resilient  development.  For  one,  to  reduce  the \nvulnerability of Pacific economies and communities to climate related natural hazards, national \nand local leaders must not only develop and implement CCA and DRR strategies that are \ntechnically,  financially,  and  politically  achievable  but  also  mainstream  them  into  the \ndevelopment  processes  from  the  national  to  the  local  community  level.  Climate  change \nresponses by Pacific DMCs are hampered by limited knowledge, technology, technical capacity, \naccess to climate financing, and effective coordination mechanisms at the regional, national, \nsector,  and  local  levels.  These  have  been  attributed  to  a  number  of  specific  issues  and \nchallenges namely the (i) need for improved regional coordination of CCA and DRR agendas \nand/or frameworks for more effective country-level coordination among concerned government \nministries; (ii) weak and limited capacity of countries to absorb the significant CCA and DRR \n                                                \n1 PIFS (Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat). 2007.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n4.  The proposed regional capacity development TA will support the implementation of the \nStrategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR): Pacific Region, which was approved by the \nPPCR Sub-Committee on 30 April 2012.7 The Pacific Regional SPCR has three complementary \ncomponents, which will be delivered through the Council of Regional Organisations in the \nPacific (CROP) agencies and mechanisms: (i) component 1, mainstreaming CCA and DRR; (ii) \ncomponent  2,  identifying  and  implementing  practical  CCA  and  DRR  knowledge  and \nexperiences; and (iii) component 3, building and supporting Pacific DMCs\u2018 capacity to respond \nto climate change risks. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will administer components 1 and \n3,8 while the World Bank will lead the administration of component 2. \n \n5.  The Pacific Regional SPCR will emphasize building capacity, and replicating and scaling \nup good practices and lessons learned from the country SPCRs in Papua New Guinea (PNG), \nSamoa, and Tonga to the other 11 Pacific DMCs with no country SPCRs. The Pacific Regional \nSPCR aims to help bring about transformational change in national programs across the region \nby  (i)  integrating  CCA  and  DRR  in  collaboration  with  existing  regional  organizations, \n(ii) increasing  knowledge  and  awareness,  (iii)  promoting  the  replication  of  climate-resilient \nmeasures, and (iv) strengthening knowledge management and national capacities in monitoring \nand evaluation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact of the Pacific Regional SPCR will be increased resilience of Pacific DMCs to \nclimate variability and climate change. Its outcome will be the improved capacity of Pacific \nDMCs to respond to climate change impacts and related natural disasters. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The TA will have two main outputs: (i) CCA and DRR mainstreamed in national and local \ndevelopment policies and plans, and (ii) Pacific DMCs\u2018 capacity to respond to climate change \nbuilt and supported. The TA will focus on priority sectors (food security and infrastructure) of \nselected Pacific DMCs, and contribute to attaining their sustainable development aspirations. It \nwill provide countries with cost-effective support best offered on a regional basis, and will \ncomplement ongoing CCA and DRR initiatives of other development partners.9 \n \n                                                \n6 Supplementary Appendix A discusses climate change and related issues and challenges in the Pacific Region, \nincluding general CCA and DRR programs, institutional framework, and lessons learned in implementing CCA and \nDRR interventions. \n7 The Pacific Regional SPCR proposal was jointly prepared by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the CROP \nagencies through a broad-based consultative process, including meetings with the Pacific DMCs, and various \nstudies under PPCR Phase 1 (ADB. 2011. TA7827-REG: Strengthening Climate Risks and Resilience Capacity of \nPacific Developing Member Countries. Manila.) The proposal was endorsed to the Climate Investment Funds by \nthe Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS). \n8 This TA covers components 1 and 3, herein referred to as outputs 1 and 2, respectively, of the Pacific Regional \nSPCR document approved by the PPCR Sub-Committee on 30 April 2012. \n9 The project and its methodology and key activities are described in more detail in Supplementary Appendix B. \n ", "  3 \n8.  Output 1: Mainstreaming climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in \nnational and local development policies and plans. This output will bring integrated CCA \nand  DRR  to  the  local  and  community  levels  and  build  them  into  budgetary  and  sector \ndevelopment plans linked to national plans in selected Pacific DMCs and priority sectors. Key \nactivities will include (i) review and assessment of current subnational planning processes to \nidentify priority needs for assistance, (ii) development of new or improvement of existing tools, \n(iii) building capacity in applying the tools, and (iv) strengthening institutional arrangements and \npolicy support for mainstreaming at the sector level linked to national development processes. \nFor  these  activities, two  or three  Pacific  DMCs,  excluding  the  three pilot  countries (PNG, \nSamoa, and Tonga), will be selected based on a set of criteria to be jointly agreed by the CROP \nagencies and the participating multilateral development banks, to ensure consistency among \nthe three components of the SPCR regional track and avoid overlaps. These criteria could be as \nfollows: (i) approved national climate change policy or strategy or approved national DRR action \nplan or approved joint national action plan or similar plan for CCA or DRR, (ii) willingness to \nparticipate in the project, (iii) on-the-ground project implementation capability, and (iv) not being \none of the PPCR pilot countries in the Pacific region. \n \n9.  A  participatory  review  of  existing  subnational  planning  processes,  policies,  and \nlegislation\u2014involving key stakeholders from government, relevant nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), priority sectors, and local communities including women and youth\u2014will identify best \npractices  on  CCA  and  DRR  mainstreaming  to  inform  national,  subnational,  and  local \nstakeholders and secure their concurrence to adopt these practices. A participatory assessment \nof key CCA and DRR issues and challenges will also be conducted, and existing CCA and DRR \nmainstreaming tools will be evaluated, to advance mainstreaming from the policy level to the \ndecision making and action level in the target sectors. Capacity building on CCA and DRR \nmainstreaming will be conducted for community leaders in the public and private sectors. In \ncollaboration with the Pacific Gender Climate Coalition, CCA and DRR policies and plans will be \nanalyzed and, if necessary, revised to become more gender sensitive. \n \n10.  Midway through the project, implementation of CCA and DRR mainstreaming in the \nselected Pacific DMCs and sectors will be reviewed and evaluated. Knowledge products on best \npractices  and  lessons will  be  prepared  and  disseminated to  other  sectors  in  the selected \ncountries and other Pacific DMCs with no PPCR country tracks, for application and/or scaling \nup, using their own resources or with support from other development partners. \n \n11.  Output 2: Building and supporting Pacific developing member countries\u2019 capacity \nto respond to climate change risks. Pacific DMCs will be provided with strategic and technical \nsupport for improved access to resource information, identification of funding opportunities and \nassistance in preparing funding applications, and pooling of Pacific experience and knowledge \nand TA. The two main activities will be (i) the development and operationalization of a Regional \nTechnical Support Mechanism (RTSM) that will respond or facilitate response to the DMCs\u2018 \nCCA- and DRR-related needs; and (ii) the establishment of a rapid response fund (RRF), which \nwill finance the experts deployed by the RTSM to requesting Pacific DMCs. \n \n12.  The RTSM will be a network of experts (e.g., on gender, climate change financing, \nknowledge management, and monitoring and evaluation) who will facilitate the Pacific DMCs\u2018 \nrapid access to technical and advisory services to help strengthen national capacity to respond \neffectively  to  climate  change.  The  RTSM  will  build  on  existing  relationships  between \ngovernments  and  development  partners,  expertise  within  CROP  agencies,  and  other \nstakeholders. In coordination with related output 1 activities, it will also develop knowledge \n ", "4     \nproducts for dissemination through the Pacific Climate Change Portal and other similar online \ninformation sources. \n \n13.  The RRF will be established with initial funding from the Pacific Regional SPCR to \nenable  the fast  deployment  of  requested  TA  to  DMCs.  It  will  fund  services  from relevant \nindependent experts, and travel and per diem costs of experts from partner organizations and \nnational governments.10 The RRF could evolve into a financing facility through contributions of \nPacific governments, CROP agencies, and/or other international and regional development \npartners. \n \n14.  The RTSM and RRF will be established with oversight and coordination by the Working \nArm of the CROP CEO Sub-Committee on Climate Change and under the guidance of the \nCROP Executives Sub-Committee on Climate Change (CES-CCC).11 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $3.691 million, to be financed on a grant basis by the ADB \nStrategic Climate Fund and administered by ADB.12 Participating CROP agencies will contribute \nin-kind support, such as the cost of participation of agency personnel in TA activities, project \nmanagement and administration support, office space, and use of facilities.13 The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB, through its Pacific Department (PARD), will be the executing agency and will \nexercise overall responsibility for coordination, supervision, and implementation of all project \nactivities. PARD will liaise with other relevant ADB units and/or offices, particularly the Pacific \nSubregional Office in Fiji and the PNG Resident Mission, and the PPCR focal person in ADB\u2018s \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department. \n \n17.  An  advisory  panel  composed  of  11  members  will  provide  strategic  guidance  in \nimplementing  the  Pacific  Regional  SPCR  under  the  TA  in  conjunction  with  the  CROP \nagencies.14 It will (i) review program implementation, (ii) ensure regular program monitoring and \nevaluation, (iii) oversee periodic progress reporting as required by the PPCR Sub-Committee, \nand (iv) recommend work progress for reporting to the countries. The panel will meet at least \n                                                \n10 Partners will include organizations that have committed to provide TA from existing staff within their respective \nagencies, e.g., CROP agencies, the United Nations, and the multilateral development banks. The partners involved \nare expected to increase over time, but initially, it will be important to allow the CROP agencies to develop the \nRTSM by building on each agency\u2018s specific comparative advantages. \n11 The Working Arm of the CROP CEO Sub-Committee on Climate Change (WACC) consists of senior officials from \neach CROP agency, and facilitates increased interaction among the CROP focal points, especially the exchange of \nexperience and information related to climate change housed in the different CROP agencies. The CES-CCC, \njointly chaired by PIFS and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), consists of \nthe heads of the various regional organizations. \n12 Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n13  The  Climate  Investment  Funds-approved  Pacific  Regional  SPCR  concept  paper  shows  the  contribution  of \nparticipating regional organizations as follows: $455,000 from SPREP for components 1 and 3, and $340,000 from \nthe Secretariat of the Pacific Community for component 2. \n14 The advisory panel will consist of 11 members: one representative each from the CROP agencies involved in \nimplementing the Pacific Regional SPCR (SPREP, PIFS, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, and the Forum \nFisheries  Agency);  one  country  representative  each  from  Melanesia,  Micronesia,  and  Polynesia;  one \nrepresentative  from  the  three  PPCR  pilot  countries  in  the  Pacific  region  (PNG,  Samoa,  Tonga);  and  one \nrepresentative each from ADB, the World Bank, and the Australian Agency for International Development. \n ", "  5 \nannually or as often as required, chaired by a CROP agency representative, as determined by \nthe CROP executives and ADB. \n \n18.  A coordination secretariat, consisting of an international secretariat coordinator and a \nnational administration and finance officer, will be established in the Pacific Islands Forum \nSecretariat (PIFS) to (i) serve as the secretariat of the advisory panel, (ii) facilitate coordination \namong the regional SPCR components and between the SPCR regional and national programs, \nand (iii) coordinate relevant development partner assistance programs to encourage sharing \nexperiences and lessons and to avoid duplication of efforts.15 \n \n19.  The  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Regional  Environment  Programme  (SPREP)  will  be \nengaged by ADB, through single source selection, to manage the program.16 As such, SPREP \nwill have responsibility for the daily management of program implementation and for providing \nthe required technical advice for CCA and DRR mainstreaming under output 1 and for RTSM \nand RRF implementation in output 2. SPREP will also manage and administer studies and \nsurveys,  training  programs,  workshops,  and  conferences,  including  subcontracting  service \nproviders  such  as  academic  and  training  institutions,  NGOs,  and  community-based \norganizations as necessary. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a 3-year period commencing on 1 June 2013 and \nending on 31 May 2016.17 ADB, through SPREP, will engage a team of international and \nnational consultants to provide 159 person-months of project management consulting services \n(para. 19) based in the SPREP headquarters in Apia, Samoa. To undertake the tasks described \nin para. 18, an international regional SPCR secretariat coordinator (18 person-months) will be \nrecruited directly by ADB and will be based at the PIFS headquarters in Suva, Fiji. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  Consultants will be engaged by ADB according to its Guidelines on Use of Consultants \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements  will  conform  to  ADB\u2018s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), and procurement of \nequipment will follow ADB\u2018s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE RANKING VICE-PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n22.  The  Ranking  Vice-President,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, recommends that the Board \napprove ADB administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3.691 million \nto be financed on a grant basis by the ADB Strategic Climate Fund for the Implementation of the \nStrategic Program for Climate Resilience: Pacific Region. \n \n \n                                                \n15 The PIFS mandate includes program coordination. Running costs of the coordination secretariat will be shared \nequitably between ADB and the World Bank to cover all three components of the Pacific Regional SPCR. \n16 SPREP as a regional center of excellence and the lead Pacific organization with demonstrated capacity in climate \nchange work is best suited to manage the proposed TA. It has a long experience in managing regional and/or \nmulti-country projects particularly on climate change. SPREP has implemented over 100 internationally-funded \nregional  projects  in  climate  change  and  environmental  management,  in  general,  and  in  CCA  and  DRR \nmainstreaming, in particular, which lies at the core of the Pacific Regional SPCR.
