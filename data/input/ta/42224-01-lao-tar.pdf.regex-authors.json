INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has long supported reforms to banking and rural \nfinance and microfinance in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The Banking \nSector Reform Program (BSRP)1 was completed in the first quarter of 2009. The program \nsupported recapitalization of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) matched with governance \nagreements to insulate the banks from political interference in their commercial operations. \nOther activities have included reforming banking laws and improving private sector access to \ncredit.  The  following  lessons  drawn  from  the  banking  reform  program  are  relevant  to  the \nproposed technical assistance (TA)2: (i) political support and macroeconomic stability are crucial \nto the success of development assistance programs in the finance sector; (ii) strong governance \nat the Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL) is fundamental for an effective prudential supervisory \nframework,  and  therefore  a  sound  banking  sector;  and  (iii)  sufficient  TA  resources  are \nnecessary to support sustained capacity development at the BOL and other financial institutions. \nA completed TA cluster on rural finance3 introduced the concept of sustainable rural finance to \nthe Lao PDR finance sector and undertook initial sector reforms. The ongoing Rural Finance \nSector Development Program (RFSDP)4 aims to restructure the Agriculture Promotion Bank \n(APB),  develop  grassroots  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  and  build  BOL  microfinance \nsupervision. The program is on track for completion in March 2011.  \n \n2.  While the banking sector has improved substantially in the past 3 years, the finance \nsector is among the shallowest in Southeast Asia and intermediation is limited. Governance in \nthe finance sector has improved, but it remains weak by regional standards. In particular, \nsupervisory capacity at the BOL, including its anti-money laundering (AML) regime, is limited, as \nis financial disclosure and private monitoring of banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs). MFIs \nare expanding, which has created additional challenges in banking supervision. Although the \nrecent global financial crisis has had a limited impact on the Lao PDR finance sector, it has \nhighlighted  the  weaknesses  in  finance  sector  regulations  and  supervision.  Further,  it  has \nunderscored the need to build the BOL's capacity to cope with future situations when the sector \nis more integrated with regional and global financial markets. The recently approved financial \nsector  strategy  of  Lao  PDR5 prioritizes  capacity  development  in  supervision.  The  strategy \nincludes  six  components:  (i)  banking  sector  development,  covering  prudential  supervision, \nintermediation, and branching; (ii) development of nonbank financial institutes; (iii) microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs); (iv) money markets; (v) capital markets; and (vi) finance sector infrastructure. \nThe strategy identifies short-term priorities including banking sector development in prudential \nsupervision and branching and expansion of rural finance coverage; and longer-term priorities \nsuch as the establishment of interbank lending. The proposed TA is aligned with the objectives \nof the strategy relating to prudential supervision.  \n \n3.  Thus, it is an opportune time to build on previous and ongoing ADB programs to further \nstrengthen the BOL's governance through capacity development in supervision. The purpose of \nthis TA is threefold: (i) strengthen capacity development for effective supervision of commercial \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n4.  The proposed TA has been included in the Lao PDR country operations business plan, \n2009\u20132011.6 The  fact-finding  missions  that  visited  Lao  PDR  in  April  2009  and  May  2009 \nreached an understanding with the government on the objectives, scope, and implementation \narrangements for the TA.7 The missions also agreed with the government to adopt the TA's \npresent title to reflect its broader scope of activity and its central objective to strengthen the \nsupervision of the banking and microfinance sectors, and to build the capacity of the AMLIU.  \n \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND ISSUES \n5.  Shallow finance sector and vulnerable banking sector. With the broad money supply \n(M2) equivalent to about 29% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008, the finance sector in \nLao PDR is shallow compared with those of neighboring countries\u2014in Viet Nam, M2 is 70% of \nGDP; in Thailand, it is 105%. The Lao PDR finance sector has deepened only modestly over the \npast 5 years. Almost all financial assets are bank deposits (about 60% of the deposits are \ndenominated in US dollars). Domestic credit to the private sector is also low compared with that \nin neighboring countries, including Cambodia. Explanations for the Lao PDR\u2019s shallow finance \nsector  include  (i)  high  transaction  costs  for  financial  intermediation  because  of  the \nunderdeveloped payments system, (ii) low creditor confidence, (iii) the slow pace of reforms of \nbank and nonbank financial institutions, and (iv) the slow development of infrastructure to \nsupport the development and growth of nonbank financial institutions. While the financial health \nof the banking sector has improved since 2003, it remains vulnerable to modest shocks as the \ncapital base of SOCBs remains small as indicated by a combined capital\u2013asset ratio of 1.77%. \n \n6.  Institutional and capacity constraints to a sound banking sector. Strong prudential \nsupervision of the banking sector is essential to ensure it is sound. However, limited supervisory \ncapacity, weak governance at the BOL, and low corporate governance standards at the SOCBs \nare major impediments. The prudential supervisory framework is outdated, and prudential rules \nand guidelines need to be aligned with international practices. The sector does not have a \nframework for prompt resolution of stressed banks. The number of trained bank supervisors is \nlimited, and frequent staff rotations within the BOL are common. Public disclosure of banking \ndata and financial reports of banks is also limited. The BOL's supervisory effectiveness is further \nundermined by the conflict of interest inherent in its roles as owner and regulator of the SOCBs. \nBest international practice shows that central bank independence is an important prerequisite \nfor effective bank supervision and monetary policy management. Implementing governance \nagreements between the BOL, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and SOCBs is one approach to \naddressing these governance issues. The proposed TA will address governance weaknesses \nby assisting (i) the BOL in strengthening its prudential supervisory framework and capacity, and \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan: Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2009\u20142011. Manila. \n7  The dates of the fact-finding missions were 20\u201330 April 2009 and 14 May 2009. The first mission was conducted in \nconjunction with a review mission of Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Sector Development Program Loans, Technical Assistant Grant, and Administration of Grant to the Lao \nPeople's  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program  and  focused  on  the \nmicrofinance part of the TA. The second mission focused on the banking sector and the anti-money laundering \ncomponents of the TA.   \n ", "  3\n(ii) the government in improving the implementation of the governance agreements with the \nSOCBs throughout the TA period. \n \n7.  Expanding rural finance and microfinance. While rural finance and microfinance in \nthe Lao PDR are still in their infancy, serving only a small portion of the rural population, they \nare expanding and new MFIs are entering the market.8 The formal sector comprises the APB, a \nrecently licensed branch of the Cambodian ACLEDA Bank, 27 regulated MFIs and savings and \ncredit unions, and 12 credit cooperatives. In addition, there are about 5,000 small village banks \nthat operate outside BOL supervision. The sector is expected to expand as some of the larger \nvillage banks register to formalize their operations under the new microfinance regulations. \n \n8.  Inadequate capacity of the microfinance supervisory unit at the Bank of the Lao \nPDR.  The  government  is  attempting  to  establish  a  more  conducive  environment  for \nmicrofinance operations. The updated national microfinance policy statement and action plan \n(MPSAP), approved by the government in 2008, forms the sector strategy to 2020. The MPSAP \ncalls for an expansion of rural finance and microfinance to reach more rural clients through the \nparticipation of commercial banks, MFIs, and cooperatives on a sustainable basis under the \nprudential supervision of the BOL. The MPSAP also recognizes that as rural finance and \nmicrofinance grow in terms of the number of MFIs, lending volume, and product sophistication, \nthis will stretch the BOL's capacity to provide sufficient supervision. Several weaknesses have \nbeen identified. First, a standardized monitoring and reporting system across the sector is \nlacking. Second, staff capacity for on-site and off-site inspections is inadequate. The BOL has a \nmicrofinance supervision unit of 11 staff under the Banks and Financial Institutions Supervision \nDepartment. As the sector grows, the task of licensing and regulating formal rural finance and \nmicrofinance institutions will be beyond the current capacity of the microfinance supervisory unit, \nand the BOL is considering upgrading it to a department. Third, microfinance regulations are \ncurrently applicable only to MFIs and savings and credit unions. To achieve more robust sector \ndevelopment, these will need to be expanded to provide the necessary legal framework for a \nbroader, more inclusive range of microfinance service providers, including credit cooperatives \nand village banks, as well as support institutions such as network organizations, rating agencies, \ntraining institutions, and wholesaling institutions.  \n \n9.  Anti-money  laundering  legislation.  An  AML  regime  is  an  essential  part  of  bank \nsupervision.  Its  effectiveness  is  anchored  in  a  sound,  well-resourced  bank  supervisory \nframework with well-trained staff. The government issued the AML decree on 27 March 2006, \nproviding for the establishment of a financial intelligence unit (FIU) and transaction reporting \nrequirements for financial institutions, among other things. Established on 14 May 2007 within \nthe BOL, the AMLIU is intended to serve as the country\u2019s financial intelligence unit. It has three \ndivisions (supervision and examination, intelligence analysis, and information technology). The \nAMLIU has department-level status and reports directly to the governor of the BOL. The Lao \nPDR became a full member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering on 26 July 2007 at \nthe group's 10th annual meeting in Perth, Australia.  \n \n10.  Strengthening anti-money laundering institutions. The AMLIU is in its infancy. Its \npriority for 2009 and 2010 is developing the capacity of its staff, including training in financial \nintelligence analysis and report writing, which are necessary for the operation of the AMLIU. \nTraining is also required in inspections and processes for monitoring suspicious transaction \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n8  An ADB survey conducted in 2004 shows that less than 2% of poor households in rural areas have access to any \nkind of formal financial services (ADB. 2006. Rural Finance in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Demand, \nSupply, and Sustainability. Manila).  \n ", "4   \nreports and cash transaction reports. The effective development of the capacity of the AMLIU \nstaff will require more integrated training. An in-house advisor is needed to interact with staff \ndaily to ensure effective on-the-job training and effective implementation of the AML regime. \nAnother effective way to build staff capacity is through short-term staff secondments to regional \nfinancial intelligence units (FIUs). The AML decree may need to be revised to make it more \neffective. Development partners such as the World Bank are assisting the AMLIU with drafting \namendments to its legal framework, and the proposed TA will be coordinated with development \npartners working in this area. \n \n11.  The proposed TA builds on past ADB assistance in strengthening governance in the \nfinance sector by enhancing the prudential supervisory framework at the BOL. The proposed TA \nis a precursor to the proposed finance sector program that has been included in the Lao PDR \ncountry operations business plan, 2009\u20132011. The successful achievement of the TA outputs \nand milestones could provide a basis for proceeding with the finance sector program.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  financial  soundness  of  the  banking  and \nmicrofinance sectors. The outcome of the TA will be improved BOL supervision of the banks \nand MFIs, and monitoring of cash transactions.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The key TA activities are divided into three components.  \n \n14.  Component  1:  Strengthen  capacity  development  for  effective  supervision  of \ncommercial banks under the supervision department of the BOL. This component will \nprovide  (i)  on-the-job  training  for  bank  supervisors  for  on-site  and  off-site  inspections  and \nassessment report writing, and up to four staff secondments to neighboring central banks \n(Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand); (ii) enhanced procedures for bank on-site and off-site \ninspections and reporting; (iii) internal procedures drafted for developing a prompt corrective \nmechanism for stressed banks; and (iv) staff training on assessment of bank vulnerabilities and \nstress tests. \n \n15.  Component  2:  Strengthening  institutional  capacity  of  the  microfinance \nsupervision  unit  at  the  BOL.  This  component  will  (i)  develop  a  standardized  industry \nmonitoring  and  reporting  system,  including  off-site  and  on-site  inspection  manuals  and \nprocedures, and corrective mechanisms for MFIs, financial cooperatives, and village banks; (ii) \nupgrade the microfinance regulations to a decree9 with possible inclusion of regulations for the \nestablishment  and  operation  of  apex  institutions,  and  facilitate  training  on  compliance;  (iii) \nprovide capacity training for the BOL's microfinance supervisors, including on-the-job training \nand exposure/study visits to different supervisory models in neighboring countries (Cambodia, \nthe Philippines, and Viet Nam); (iv) support a study on upgrading the MFI supervisory unit to a \ndepartment,  as  necessary;  and  (v)  support  a  feasibility  study  for  the  establishment  of  a \nnationwide apex institution to provide financial and technical support to MFIs.   \n \n                                                 \n9 In the Lao PDR legislation, decree is a legal document signed by the Prime Minister.  \n ", "  5\n16.  Component  3:  Enhanced  capacity  of  staff  at  the  Anti-Money  Laundering \nIntelligence Unit. This component will support further development and capacity strengthening \nof the AML regime, particularly capacity development at the AMLIU in the following areas: (i) \npreparation of guidelines to implement the AML decree; (ii) on-the-job training for staff of the \nAMLIU in areas including intelligence analysis, monitoring and inspections, and report writing, \nbased on best international practices; (iii) communications and media training; (iv) training for \nrelevant staff in government agencies, as well as financial institutions with responsibilities for \nimplementing the AML regime (this will include training on reporting requirements for staff of \nfinancial institutions); (v) design and development of an appropriate information technology \nsystem for receiving, storing, and analyzing transaction reports and procurement of equipment; \n(vi) preparation for the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering mutual evaluation in 2010; and \n(vii) input to upgrading the decree to a law over the longer term. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000. ADB will provide the equivalent of $500,000. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV) for \nactivities under components 1 ($284,500) and 2 ($215,500). The Cooperation Fund for Regional \nTrade and Financial Security Initiative will provide $250,000 for capacity development at the \nAMLIU under component 3. The government will finance the remainder, equivalent to $150,000, \nto cover the counterpart in-kind costs. The TA's cost estimates and financing plan are in Table \nA2.1 and a breakdown of the TA's cost estimates by each component is in Table A2.2, both in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The BOL will be the executing agency. The Bank Supervision Unit under the Banks and \nFinancial Institutions Supervision Department (BFISD) of the BOL will be the implementing \nagency for component 1, the Microfinance Supervision Unit under BFISD will be responsible for \nactivities under component 2, and the AMLIU will be the implementing agency for component 3.  \nThe BFISD will provide office space with furniture and support services for the consultants, \nwhile  office  computers  and  supplies  will  be  provided  by  the  TA  project.  A  team  of  five \ninternational  consultants  (totaling  15  person-months),  two  national  consultants  (totaling  15 \nperson-months),  one  national  project  administrator  (totaling  18  person-months),  and  one \nresearch assistant (10 person-months) will be engaged individually to carry out the activities \nunder the TA project. ADB will individually recruit the international and national consultants in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with the ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (January 2008, as amended from time to time). Equipment procured \nunder  this  TA  project  will  be  procured  following  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), and the assets will be handed over to the BOL upon completion of \nthe project. A project management unit will be established at the BOL under one of its deputy \ngovernors. The TA project will be implemented over 18 months from January 2010 to June \n2011, following the signing of the TA agreement between the government and ADB. Consultant \ndeliverables are included in the terms of references in Appendix 3. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6   \nIV.
