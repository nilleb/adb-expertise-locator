The purpose of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific Strategy 2005-2009 is to \nprovide  a  framework  for  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  its  14  Pacific  developing  member  countries \n(PDMCs)1 and for ADB support to regional cooperation in the Pacific. The PDMCs\u2019 development \nperformance over the past decade has been mixed. Modest growth and social progress have \nbeen evident for a few PDMCs, many have made minimal progress, and some have seen \nmeasurable declines. To date, the private sector has generally been unable to lead economic \ngrowth. Overall development management remains weak and handicaps sustainable economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The development challenges the PDMCs face exemplify \nthe importance of capacity building for the development process both within and outside the \npublic sector.  \n \n2.  The  quality  of  human  resources  available  in  both  the  private  and  public  sectors, \nespecially  in  relation  to  midlevel  and  senior  management,  along  with  the  quality  of  the \ninstitutional and organizational environments in which they work, affects economic growth and \npoverty reduction in the PDMCs. A pressing need exists for a critical mass of highly competent \nand qualified midlevel and senior management and technical staff in the private and public \nsectors to spearhead the socioeconomic development of the PDMCs. Also needed is a better \nunderstanding of the means to improve the institutions that support such staff. In response to \nthese needs, ADB will provide regional technical assistance (TA)2 to finance the training of \nselected midlevel and senior managers specializing in planning, managing, implementing, and \nevaluating development plans, programs, projects, and other related activities and to assess \npublic institutions and ascertain how they might be improved. The TA project framework is \nshown in Appendix 1.  \n \n3.  This TA for the Leadership Enhancement and Advancement Program (LEAP) will lay the \nfoundations  for  a  continuous,  demand-driven,  outcome-oriented  training  program  based  on \nneeds and competency for midlevel and senior managers from governments, private sectors, \nand civil society organizations within a well-rounded and strategic framework. LEAP will be \nlinked  to  national  development  priorities  and  will  be  developed  and  implemented  in  close \npartnership  with  the  PDMCs,  stakeholder  groups,  and  other  development  agencies.  It  will \ncomplement ongoing and planned activities by the PDMCs and other international development \nagencies.  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n4.  The  synergy  between  and  among  governments,  businesses,  and  civil  society \norganizations has been weak. A not uncommon situation is that where governments have failed \nto fulfill their obligations, private sectors have also been unable to satisfactorily perform their \nappropriate roles and functions in relation to national development. Those PDMCs that are most \nin need of growth and progress have weak capacity for managing the process. To significantly \nimprove  living  conditions  in  the  PDMCs,  efficient  and  effective  public  and  private  service \ndelivery is critical. To this end, governments, private sectors, and civil society must work in close \ncollaboration with each other.   \n                                                 \n1  ADB\u2019s PDMCs are Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru,  \nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 November 2004. \n ", "2   \n5.  Institutional and organizational development is a complex and ongoing process that \nshould take place over the long term, as should the development of leadership and managerial \ncompetencies. The latter cannot and should not be fast-tracked nor should it be carried out by \nmeans of a one-off program. However, the PDMCs tend to misunderstand and underestimate \nhuman resource development needs. When confronted with financial difficulties, PDMCs usually \nreduce budgets for in-service training (INSET) or professional development programs (PDPs). \nToo often, PDMCs\u2019 INSET and/or PDPs are project based or supply driven, limited in coverage, \nad hoc, discontinuous, inadequate, and ineffective. The lessons learnt in the PDMCs clearly \nindicate that political and nongovernment intermediation has fallen short of providing the most \neffective mechanisms for social change and organizational development.   \n \n6.  Other common problems in the PDMCs include (i) the lack of an overall capacity building \nframework to guide INSET and PDPs, (ii) the centralized planning and implementation of INSET \nand PDPs, (iii) the failure of INSET and PDPs to focus on actual problems and needs, (iv) the \ninsufficiency of  instructional and learning materials for INSET and PDPs, (v) the inadequacy of  \ninstitutional incentives or rewards for outstanding performance resulting from INSET and PDPs, \n(vi) the failure of political leaders and top executives to appreciate the value of INSET and \nPDPs,  (vii)  the  lack  of  a  critical  mass  of  INSET  and  PDP  champions,  (viii)  the  fact  that \nparticipation in INSET or PDPs often impinges on regular working hours, (ix) the weak system \nfor monitoring and measuring work performance and program outcomes, and (x) the lack of \nadministrative and logistical support.  \n \n7.  Experiences with undertaking capacity-building programs for the PDMCs and for other \ndeveloping  member  countries,  particularly  the  Pacific  Governance  and  Public  Sector \nManagement TA,3 underscores the importance of investing sufficient time and resources in (i) \ntargeting, profiling, and analyzing needs; (ii) emphasizing participatory approaches; (iii) building \nstakeholder ownership of a program; (iv) forging alliances and partnerships with stakeholders \nand institutions; (v) creating a critical mass of champions; and (vi) institutionalizing initiatives to \nguarantee  programs\u2019  sustainability.  This  kind  of  inclusive  process  lays  the  groundwork  for \ninstitutionalizing INSET and PDP interventions that contribute significantly to the success of a \ncapacity-building program. \n \n8.  The TA will focus on long-term, results-based development of managerial and leadership \nskills aimed at achieving ongoing and sustainable enhancement of capacity for management \ndevelopment in the PDMCs. It will assess their leadership programs in a collaborative manner \nwith various PDMCs and with diverse and representative groups outside the government in \npartnership with other external funding agencies, such as the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment and the New Zealand Agency for International Aid.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The aim of the TA is to contribute to overall efforts to promote and sustain sound \ndevelopment management in the PDMCs, thereby improving living standards and reducing \npoverty. Specifically, the TA will (i) design training courses to enhance the leadership and \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for the Pacific Governance and Public Sector Management Training Program. \nManila (TA 5908-REG, approved on 31 March 2000 for $882,000). \n ", "        3 \nmanagerial skills of midlevel and senior managers in governments, private sectors, and civil \nsociety; and (ii) build and reinforce partnerships and strengthen cooperation among regional \nand national institutions in relation to implementing LEAP. \n \n10.  The key outputs of the TA will include: (i) a shortlist and profile of target trainees, (ii) a \ntraining needs analysis (TNA) report, (iii) a benchmarking of technical competencies, (iv) the \ndesign of a training course and of instructional approaches pending the TNA\u2019s findings, (v) a  \nmonitoring and evaluation framework for measuring learning achievements and outcomes, (vi) a \nnetwork of learning institutions and service providers in the region, (vii) the setting up of twinning \narrangements with leading educational and training institutions in the region, and (viii) the \ntraining of trainers.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will build upon past INSET and PDP interventions and will complement existing \nand planned programs aimed at enhancing the professional competencies of development \nmanagers. The TA will provide a program that is needs and competency based and is oriented \ntowards providing target beneficiaries with the know-how and skills they need to effectively \npromote, manage, and sustain development. The TA will emphasize innovative instructional \nstrategies. It will provide a framework and groundwork for providing continuous and sustainable \nINSET and PDPs that will enhance institutional and organizational effectiveness, improve living \nconditions,  and  reduce  poverty.  Leadership  and  management  competencies  will  be \nstrengthened by cooperating with stakeholders and harnessing local knowledge and talents. \nParticipatory approaches will be adopted during all stages of INSET and PDP development.  \n \n12.  Subject to the results of the TNA and validation with stakeholders, indicative course \ntopics may include strategic planning, program review and evaluation, management of change, \nrisk analysis and management, institutional and organizational development, policy analysis and \npolicy  formulation,  financial  analysis  and  management,  performance-based  management, \ngovernance, cooperating with others, conflict management, partnering, and networking  \n \n13.  In the long term, each PDMC will deliver and sustain LEAP through an institutionalized \nprogram that they plan, develop, and implement. A sustained and continuing process of TNA, \ncourse  and  learning  materials  development,  operational  management  circles,  and  periodic \nperformance monitoring and evaluation is envisaged.  \n \n14.  The  institutionalization  of  LEAP  consists  of  three  phases.  The  first  phase  involves \nanalyzing  needs,  developing  courses,  and  training  three-  to  five-member  resource  support \nteams  in  each  PDMC.  Competency  standards  for  midlevel  and  senior  managers  will  be \nidentified  and  matched  with  trainees.  The  training  curriculum  and  modules  will  also  be \ndeveloped. Basic courses will initially be implemented at a common venue for a limited number \nof participants representing the 14 PDMCs. Networking and twinning arrangements will be \nidentified and established. This TA will be limited to the first phase. The TA will identify credible \nservice providers of training in the region, and information about them will be disseminated to \nPDMCs and training providers. As far as possible, these service providers will be responsible for \ncourses and services under the TA. In relation to twinning arrangements, appropriate learning \ncenters  or  educational  institutions  in  the  PDMCs  will  partner  with  leading  universities  and \ntraining institutes in the region to develop and implement a well-rounded capacity-building \n ", "4   \nprogram for trainers and development managers. Both networking and twinning will involve the \nsigning of memorandums of understanding and the formulation of action plans.  \n \n15.  During the second phase, the TA will be increasingly implemented on-site (i.e., in each \nPDMC)  as  far  as  practicable,  and  it  is  at  this  state  that  the  networking  and  twinning \narrangements will be further strengthened. Each PDMC will form management circles that meet \nregularly to promote good governance, professionalism and dedicated public service and serve \nas professional networks. Furthermore, the TA should increasingly be able to tap into local \nexpertise. Evaluation of and feedback from INSET activities will be built in and periodic reviews \nwill be scheduled and agreed on. Effective development management practices will be identified \nand used as training resources. The third phase will seek to merge distance education and \napplicable e-learning options with the TA\u2019s on-site program to accelerate coverage and further \nenhance sustainability. The capacities of local educational and training institutions will be further \nstrengthened during the second and third phases. \n \n16.  After meeting the selection criteria (Appendix 2), prospective TA beneficiaries will be \nofficially nominated by their governments, private chambers of commerce, and civil society \norganizations. Selection will be made on a clear and transparent merit basis. Trainees, courses, \nand  partner  institutions  will  be  screened  and  endorsed  by  a  steering  committee  for  ADB \napproval. The TA will be reviewed 12 months after the start of implementation and evaluated \nwhen nearing completion, and the PDMCs and other stakeholders will be consulted regarding \nadjustments for possible subsequent programs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. Appendix 3 presents the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Department  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the TA with a program secretariat comprising three international \nconsultants and a locally engaged training coordinator. A steering committee will be established \nto oversee the TA. The steering committee will consist of the heads of selected participating \ninstitutions and PDMC national coordinators or other appropriate representatives nominated by \nthe governments concerned. The secretariat will be responsible for nominations for courses, \naccounting, monitoring and evaluation, and report preparation. The steering committee will \nestablish policy guidelines for the training programs and will meet at least annually in the \nsubregion to review progress and resolve issues. Where appropriate, twinning with leading \nacademic and training institutions will be arranged.4  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years commencing in March 2005 and ending in \nFebruary 2007. Progress will be reviewed after 12 months and 24 months. Equipment will be \nprocured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. On completion of the TA, the secretariat \nwill retain all equipment for use in follow-up programs. Further support for LEAP from ADB or \n                                                 \n4  Possible institutions to be tapped by the TA include University of the South Pacific, National College of Public \nAdministration and Governance of the University of the Philippines, Asian Institute of Management, Australian \nNational University, Massey University Graduate School of Business, and University of Papua New Guinea.  \n ", "        5 \nother sources will depend on the results of the training program and the value it adds to the first \nbatch of trainees and their development environment. The activity funded by this TA will only \ncommence after ADB has received no objection in writing to the inclusion of such PDMC in the \nTA from the governments concerned.  \n \n20.  For  all  components  of  the  TA,  post-training  questionnaires  will  be  administered  to \nparticipants and the results analyzed to assess courses\u2019 effectiveness in meeting participants\u2019 \nexpectations  and  needs.  Pacific  Department  staff  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and \nreporting on the implementation of the TA.   \n \n21.  Three international consultants will be required for a total 14 person-months and one \nlocal consultant will be required for 10 person-months for the TA secretariat, with their services \nrendered intermittently. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants.  Terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The reporting \nrequirements for consultants will include an inception report, progress reports, and a final report \nsummarizing the TA\u2019s outputs and achievements.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nthe  Pacific  Developing  Member  Countries\u2019  Leadership  Enhancement  and  Advancement \nProgram and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n
