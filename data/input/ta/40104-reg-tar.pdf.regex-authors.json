In 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) assessed the costs and anticipated impact \nof HIV/AIDS on Asia\u2019s economic growth and development, with emphasis on the potential \neffects on vulnerable groups.1 The assessment concluded that spending on HIV prevention and \nAIDS care was justified by the high economic returns that reasonably could be expected from \nsuch spending. During the eighth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF IX), ADB \nand its member states, recognizing that more needed to be done to address the challenges that \nHIV/AIDS  poses  to  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  agreed  to  earmark  2%  of  ADF  resources \n(approximately  $140  million)  for  grant  assistance  targeting  HIV/AIDS  and  other  infectious \ndiseases in all ADF-eligible developing member countries (DMC). \n \n2.  Management  approved  a  strategic  directions  paper2  in  April  2005  defining  ADB's \nresponse to the AIDS epidemic. The paper reflects an institution-wide consensus on how, and in \nwhat areas, ADB is best placed to support the DMCs in their fight against HIV/AIDS. The paper \nacknowledges ADB\u2019s commitment to (i) achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nrelated to HIV/AIDS, as set out in the memorandum of understanding that ADB signed with the \nJoint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in February 2005; and (ii) reducing the \nrisk and vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV/AIDS infection, and alleviating its \nimpact.3 \n \n3.  In parallel, ADB and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) \nhad been discussing how to strengthen their collaboration in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Asia \nand the Pacific region. On 23 February 2005, ADB signed an agreement with the Government \nof Sweden to establish a Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (the \nFund).4The Government of Sweden made an initial commitment of SKr100,000,000 (equivalent \n \nto $12,930,000 as of 11 April 2006) to the Fund, which was to be provided over 4 years (2005\u2013\n2008).  Open  to  other  funding  agencies,  the  Fund  will  complement  and  leverage  ADF  IX \nresources, in accordance with ADB's strategic directions paper. This technical assistance (TA) \npaper describes how the Fund\u2019s resources are to be used. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Asia is in the path of the global AIDS pandemic. With an estimated 8.3 million infections \n(including 1.1 million people newly infected in 2005), the region is at a pivotal juncture. The \nAsian AIDS epidemic seems unlikely to reach the levels seen in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the \ndisease  increasingly  is  threatening  entire  nations  with  potential  economic  and  institutional \ncollapse. However, if current trends continue in Asia, which is home to 60% of the world\u2019s \npopulation, the results could be devastating socially and economically.  \n \n5.  An  interdisciplinary  approach  is  needed  to  fight  HIV/AIDS  effectively.  National \ngovernments must lead aid coordination to ensure concerted country-level responses in line \nwith the \u201cThree Ones\u201d key principles: (i) one agreed HIV/AIDS action framework that provides \nthe basis for coordinating the work of all partners; (ii) one national AIDS coordinating authority \nwith a broad-based multisector mandate; and (iii) one agreed country-level monitoring and \nevaluation system. Support for fighting HIV/AIDS should be provided within this context. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Asia\u2019s Economies and the Challenge of AIDS. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2005. Development, Poverty and HIV/AIDS: ADB\u2019s Strategic Response to a Growing Epidemic. Manila. \n3  As indicated in the Declaration of Commitment adopted by the United Nations General Assembly Special Session \non HIV/AIDS, June 2001. \n4  ADB. 2005. Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n5  This TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 27 March 2006.  \n ", "2     \n6.  ADB\u2019s engagement with a broad range of actors, partners, and networks in sector-\nspecific policy dialogue and investments provides an enabling environment for a systematic and \nmultisector approach to HIV/AIDS prevention and care. ADB\u2019s comparative advantage is rooted \nin  its  access  to,  and  policy  dialogue  with,  ministries  of  finance  and  \u201chard\u201d  sectors  (i.e., \ntransportation, energy, and urban development), and national planning agencies. ADB also \nplays  an  important  catalytic  role  in  documenting  and  disseminating  good  practices.  These \nstrengths justified the establishment of the Fund. \n \n7.  The availability of grant resources from ADF IX in 2005 was a powerful incentive to \ndevelop a stronger portfolio of HIV/AIDS-specific activities, consistent with the direction set out \nin the strategic directions paper. These resources have been allocated to strengthen HIV/AIDS \nmitigation measures in ADB loans that are being implemented or prepared. ADB\u2019s transport and \ncommunications  sector,  a  core  business  area,  is  gaining  experience  in  supporting  and \nimplementing  HIV/AIDS  initiatives.6  ADB\u2019s  physical  infrastructure  projects  are  incorporating \nmore  comprehensive  HIV/AIDS  components,  with  increasing  attention  to  gender,  human \ntrafficking,  and  migration.  Effectiveness  and  sustainability  are  being  emphasized  through \nincreased partnership and capacity development activities targeting local government agencies, \nnongovernment organizations (NGO), local communities, and the private sector. Through the \nFund, this emerging approach could be expanded and strengthened. \n \n8.  In September 2005, a progress report assessed the accomplishments in implementing \nthe strategic directions paper. While acknowledging ADB\u2019s efforts to achieve a more systematic \nand  multisector  approach  to  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  care,  the  report  also  identified  key \nconstraints and made recommendations (paras. 9\u201312). \n \n9.  The countries of Asia and the Pacific are characterized by different HIV prevalence and \nincidence rates, epidemiological patterns, and modes of transmission. Until recently, HIV was \ntransmitted in Asia mainly among injecting drug users (IDU) and sex workers. As a result, \nHIV/AIDS  prevalence  in  most  countries  was  confined  to  groups  with  high-risk  behavior. \nHowever, current estimates suggest that HIV increasingly is spreading from localized high-risk \ngroups  into  the  general  population.  Girls  and  women  face  the  greatest  risk.  The  rapidly \nchanging  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  has  distinct  cultural  and  subpopulation  factors  that  drive  its \nspread, including greater exposure of women to its risks and impacts. Regular collation and \nreview  of  reliable  gender-disaggregated  data  are  needed,  as  well  as  careful  analyses  of \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  results,  to  ensure  an  accurate  knowledge  base  conducive  to \nevidence-based country strategies and programs (CSP). The CSPs should present information \non HIV/AIDS prevalence and trends at the national, local, and household levels. Further, they \nshould show the impact of the AIDS epidemic on economic growth, poverty reduction, and\u2014\nincreasingly\u2014gender relations.  \n \n10.  A  multisector  and  gender-responsive  approach  to  the  inherent  risks  of  HIV/AIDS \ninfection should be reflected adequately in sector strategies, road maps, and programs, as well \nas  in  the  design  of  HIV/AIDS  mitigation  measures  in  ADB-funded  projects.  The  quality, \noutreach, and impact of national HIV/AIDS programs, funding agencies\u2019 responses, and gaps in \ntargeting and outreach need to be assessed constantly at the country and regional levels. \n                                                 \n6  In 2005, several transport projects with HIV/AIDS components were approved, including: \n   ADB.  2005.  Proposed  Grant  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Project \n(Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam). Manila. (with HIV/AIDS and human trafficking \ncomponent); ADB. 2005. Proposed Loan and Asian Development Fund Grant Dushanbe-Kyrgyz Border Road \nRehabilitation Project, Phase II (Tajikistan). Manila.

Manila. (with \ncommunity empowerment component); and  \n  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to Viet Nam for Preparing HIV/AIDS Prevention Among Youth Project. Manila. \n ", "  3\nGuidelines and technical support need to be provided to ensure adequate access to, and use of, \nrelevant data, information, and resources. \n \n11.  As highlighted at the 7th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (Kobe \n2005), most of the Asians infected with HIV belong to vulnerable populations. To maximize the \nuse of limited resources, interventions should focus on migrant workers, sex workers, IDUs, \nmen  who  have  sex  with  men,  and  the  youth.  Power  relations  between  men  and  women \ncontribute significantly to women\u2019s greater exposure and vulnerability to the risks and impacts of \nHIV/AIDS.  Research  confirms  that  women\u2014especially  young  women\u2014are  extremely \nvulnerable,  and  points  to  complex  links  among  poverty,  inequality  (in  particular  gender \ninequality), and the spread of HIV.  \n \n12.  The impact of ADB\u2019s contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS could be maximized by \nstrengthening internal capacity. Staff constraints identified during discussions on the Fund will \nbe reduced using the Fund\u2019s resources to provide long-term technical support and develop \ninternal capacity. This would enable ADB to help DMCs respond more effectively to the AIDS \nepidemic. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The proposed regional TA is umbrella assistance comprising 11 subprojects (Appendix \n3).7 It will help DMCs achieve the sixth MDG, target 7: \u201chalt and begin to reverse the spread of \nHIV/AIDS\u201d  8  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  by  2015.  The  TA\u2019s  outcome  will  be  to  develop  and \nimplement a more effective and evidence-based response to the AIDS epidemic at the country \nand regional levels. It will have four major outputs, consolidating individual outputs from TA-\nfunded subprojects: (i) knowledge products, such as issue papers and technical notes on \nemerging issues relevant to ADB operations, consolidating outputs from TA-funded subprojects \nunder  component  1;  (ii)  review  of  socially  inclusive  and  community-driven  HIV/AIDS \ninterventions,  presenting  practical  lessons  learned  and  good  practices  from  TA-funded \nsubprojects under component 2; (iii) evidence-based guidelines and tools for effective HIV/AIDS \nprevention  and  care;  and  (iv)  HIV/AIDS  training  program  and  modules  for  ADB  staff, \nconsolidating  outputs  from  TA-funded  subprojects  under  component  3.  TA  outputs  will  be \nfinalized  in  partnership  with  Sida  and  UNAIDS,  distributed  to  DMC  governments  and \nnongovernment partners, and posted on ADB\u2019s HIV/AIDS website. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The proposed activities are grouped into three TA components: (i) knowledge base; (ii) \noperational support, and (iii) capacity development. \n \n1.  Component 1: Knowledge Base \n \n15.  This component aims to strengthen the HIV/AIDS knowledge base to enable a more \ncost-effective and evidence-based approach to the AIDS epidemic in Asia and the Pacific. \nEvidence-based  advocacy  will  be  supported  by  developing  (i)  a  regional  database;  (ii) \ninformation services; and (iii) publications on trends, risk behavior patterns, responses, and \nimpacts. Resource tracking and economic impact analyses will assess financing needs and \ngaps in providing a package of essential HIV/AIDS prevention and care services in the region, \nas  well  as  economic  updates  and  poverty  analyses.  A  review  and  identification  of  good \n                                                 \n7  The HIV/AIDS steering committee endorsed the list of subprojects, which was approved by Sida, according to the \nGeneral Principles of the Cooperation Fund set out in Appendix 2. Endorsed subprojects are in the supplementary \nappendix, available upon request. \n8   Website of the UN Millennium Development Goals (on 19 April 2006). http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/#  \n ", "4     \npractices and lessons for socially inclusive and community-driven HIV/AIDS interventions will \ncomplement this knowledge base. Subprojects under this component will be implemented in \ncollaboration  with  UNAIDS  to  ensure  peer  discussions,  high  quality  products,  and  broad \ndissemination. \n \n2.  Component 2: Operational Support \n \n16.  This component will identify modalities to strengthen the design and impact of HIV/AIDS \nelements in ADB core business areas of road transport, energy, urban infrastructure, rural \ninfrastructure,  and  education.  The  role  of  civil  society  organizations  in  promoting  effective \noutreach and delivery of essential HIV/AIDS services to the poor, vulnerable, and high-risk \ngroups  will  be  tested  by  engaging  with  a  broad  range  of  NGOs  and  community-based \norganizations. The activities will be monitored and assessed carefully for possible replication \nand incorporation in CSPs. Subprojects will help document modalities to ensure the participation \nand involvement of ethnic minorities in the design and implementation of HIV/AIDS preventative \nmeasures. Women\u2019s greater exposure to the risks and impacts of HIV/AIDS calls for a rigorous \nassessment of the impact of HIV-related and gender-based discrimination, and an evaluation of \ngender  design  features  and  impacts  of  selected  ADB-funded  physical  infrastructure  loans. \nBased on the subproject outputs and review of successful activities, training programs will be \ndeveloped to support government-led participatory reviews. The aim will be to translate national \nHIV/AIDS strategic plans into operational plans with financial and human resource management \nindicators, identified priorities and targets, and monitoring and evaluation systems. \n \n3.  Component 3: Capacity Development \n \n17.  The  TA  will  support  subprojects  to  develop  the  capacity  (human,  structural,  and \nmanagerial) of selected national and regional organizations to undertake effective interventions \nfocused on high-risk groups. These subprojects will involve (i) development of a framework that \ncan  be  institutionalized  across  all  countries  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  approach  to  HIV \nprevention among high-risk groups; (ii) capacity building (workshops, training, and development \nof tools) at the country and regional level; and (iii) reduction of policy barriers in the DMCs \nthrough evidence-based analysis and advocacy. Subprojects under this component will be \nimplemented in collaboration with UNAIDS. \n \n18.  This component will support the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Unit in ADB\u2019s Gender, \nSocial  Development  and  Civil  Society  (RSGS)  Division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD). Further, it will promote increased HIV/AIDS awareness, \nskills, and knowledge among ADB staff. Internal skills and knowledge will be strengthened \nthrough the services of an HIV/AIDS senior advisor, who will be engaged to (i) advise ADB on \ncritical HIV/AIDS issues in Asia and the Pacific, as well as emerging areas of research, policy, \nand law relevant to ADB operations; (ii) suggest ways to improve the implementation of ADB's \nHIV/AIDS  strategic  directions  paper;  and  (iii)  advise  ADB  on  innovative  approaches,  good \npractices,  and  lessons  related  to  successful  responses  to  HIV/AIDS,  which  could  be \nincorporated  in  ADB  financing,  strategies,  programs,  and  projects.  An  HIV/AIDS  training \nprogram will address the need to increase staff awareness and basic skills.9 Training modules \nwill include public health aspects of HIV/AIDS; lessons and good practices in incorporating \nHIV/AIDS prevention into ADB core business areas of operations; and gender, social exclusion, \nand vulnerability to the risks and impacts of HIV/AIDS. \n \n                                                 \n9  The training program will be based on an ADB staff survey on HIV/AIDS awareness and knowledge to be carried \nout at project outset and project completion. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $8,670,000 (SKr67,039,041 as of 11 April 2006), which the \nFund  will  finance  through  a  grant  administered  by  ADB.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will implement the TA through the HIV/AIDS Unit in RSGS, in association with the \nregional departments. The HIV/AIDS Unit will have a secretariat responsible for coordinating \nand implementing the TA, including administering and monitoring TA subprojects. Subprojects \nincluded in the work program have been selected based on the general principles set forth for \nthe  implementation  of  the  Fund,  endorsed  by  Sida  in  accordance  with  the  agreement \nestablishing the Fund.10 Staff in the regional departments, resident missions (RM), and RSDD \ncan submit to the HIV/AIDS Unit additional subprojects developed during the year. These will be \nconsidered  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  and  submitted  for  endorsement  to  the  HIV/AIDS  steering \ncommittee, chaired by the RSGS director. The steering committee will comprise the chair of the \nHealth  Community  of  Practice  and  the  regional  departments\u2019  social  sector  directors.  The \nproposals also will be sent to Sida for approval, following the process outlined in Appendix 5.11 \nThe project officers in the regional departments and/or RMs will implement the subprojects in \nconsultation  with  RSGS  and  other  relevant  staff.  Subprojects  of  project  officers  at  ADB \nheadquarters will be implemented in close cooperation with the relevant RM staff and UNAIDS \ncountry and regional offices. \n \n21.  The HIV/AIDS Unit will consist of one full-time administrator (international consultant) \nand a research assistant (domestic consultant), financed under the TA. They will report to the \nprincipal health specialist in RSGS. Additional short-term international individual consultants will \nbe recruited, including an HIV/AIDS senior policy adviser, to provide guidance on policy and \nstrategic issues to strengthen ADB\u2019s internal knowledge base and operational response to the \nAIDS epidemic. An outline of consultants\u2019 estimated inputs for TA-funded subprojects is in \nAppendix 6. Outline terms of reference of individual consultants for the HIV/AIDS Unit are in \nAppendix 7. ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB  for  the  recruitment  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  used  to  select  and  engage  TA \nconsultants.  Procurement  of  goods  and  other  services  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. At TA completion, the equipment will be turned over to the executing \nagencies  and/or  implementing  agencies  concerned.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  36 \nmonths, from June 2006 to June 2009. All subprojects will provide biannual progress reports to \nthe HIV/AIDS Unit for consolidation into an annual progress report that will be submitted to the \nsteering committee for review and discussion, and sent to Sida. Selected reports will be posted \non ADB\u2019s HIV/AIDS website. ADB and funding agencies will review the activities jointly each \nyear. A midterm review in December 2007 will assess outcomes of the TA and recommend \nfollow-up activities, as required. A list of expected reports is in Appendix 8. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n22.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $8,670,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nCooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia \nand the Pacific.   \n                                                 \n10  Before the start of TA subprojects in a DMC, appropriate government consent or no-objection will be obtained. \n11  Follow-on RETAs are anticipated to consolidate subprojects under work programs for 2007 and 2008. \n ", "6    Appendix 1
