INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership  Forum  (CSLF),  through  its  secretariat, \napproached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in January 2009 to provide assistance on a \nstudy of key policy issues and barriers that may prevent or delay demonstration of carbon \ndioxide  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  technologies  in  developing  countries.1 The  proposed \nregional  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  study  emerged  from  a  series  of \ndeliberations during CSLF financial issues task force (the task force) meetings that occurred \nover the course of more than a year. ADB attended the task force meetings as a stakeholder.2 \nDuring the last task force meeting in India in December 2008, the request for the proposed TA \nwas endorsed. Subsequent discussions were held with the CSLF secretariat and some key \nmembers  (notably  the  European  Commission),  to  firm  up  the  impact,  outcomes,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements of the TA, as reflected in this \nreport.3 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Climate change is emerging as a key development challenge in the region. A growing \nbody of scientific evidence indicates that increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs) caused by \nhuman activities are predominantly responsible for rapid ongoing climate change. In its fourth \nassessment report in 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted \nthe need to halve energy-related carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by 2050, if global temperature \n2\nincreases  are  to  be  kept  below  2  to  3  degrees  Celsius;  such  increases  correspond  to \nstabilization scenarios that limit atmospheric CO  to concentrations of 450 and 550 parts per \n2\nmillion (ppm), respectively.4 A global-scale assessment by the International Energy Agency (IEA) \nhas found that CCS technologies have the potential to reduce overall climate change mitigation \ncosts and increase flexibility in reducing GHG emissions. CCS is an integral part of all GHG \nemission reduction strategies proposed by IPCC and IEA.  \n \n3.  Globally, electricity generation accounts for 29% of CO emissions. CCS provides the \n2 \nsecond-largest potential for CO  emission reductions (after energy efficiency). However, CCS is \n2\nin the early stages of development and urgent actions are required to undertake demonstration \nprojects.  IEA,  in  its  report  to  the  Group  of  8  summit  in  Hokkaido,  Japan  in  July  2008, \nrecommended that at least 20 fully integrated industrial-scale demonstration power plants with \nCCS be committed and new generation stock be prepared for future CCS retrofit.5 The Group of \n8  summit  strongly  supported  the  launching  of  20  large-scale  CCS  demonstration  projects \nglobally by 2010, taking into account various national circumstances, with a view to beginning \nbroad deployment of CCS by 2020. At the moment, there is no industrial-scale coal-based \npower plant with CCS. Based on IEA's World Energy Outlook 2008, a total of about 1,000 \ngigawatts of new coal-based capacity will be added in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n                                                 \n1  The CSLF is a framework for international cooperation in research and development for the separation, capture, \ntransportation and storage of CO  (generally referred to as CCS).  \n2\n2  The financial issues task force is one of the four task forces supporting CSLF objectives, India is the chair. ADB \nbecame a stakeholder of CSLF in November 2007.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 March 2009.  \n4  The stabilization scenarios refer to targeted atmospheric CO  concentrations of 450 and 550 ppm by 2030, and are \n2\nbeing discussed globally for a possible post-2012 global climate change policy regime.  \n5  In 2005, Group of 8 leaders invited the IEA to contribute to the Gleneagles G8 Plan of Action for Climate Change, \nClean Energy and Sustainable Development. IEA was asked to advise on alternative scenarios and strategies for a \nclean, clever, and competitive energy future.  \n ", "2 \n \nand India over the next 20\u201325 years.6 In general, Asia is expected to continue to be the largest \nuser of coal.    \n \n4.  The CSLF seeks to make CCS commercially competitive and environmentally safe. It is \nan international effort largely supported by ADB member countries and is expected to result in \ntechnology transfer and rapid diffusion of CCS in developing member countries. CSLF members \nare national governmental entities that are significant producers or users of fossil fuels and have \ncommitted  to  the  investment  of  resources  in  CCS  technology  research,  development  and \ndemonstration activities. Among ADB\u2019s developing member countries, the PRC and India are \nCSLF member countries. The activities of the CSLF are conducted by a policy group, which \ngoverns the overall framework and policies, and a technical group, which reviews the progress \nof  collaborative  projects  and  makes  recommendations  to  the  policy  group  on  any  needed \nactions. The United States Department of Energy is the secretariat for the CSLF. India is the \nvice chair of the CSLF technical group.  \n \n5.  CCS is particularly relevant to future decoupling of the growing energy needs of large, \ncoal-based economies (such as those of the PRC and India) from rising CO  emissions. Both \n2\nthe PRC and India have taken a keen interest in CCS development. The CSLF is one of the few \nforums that brings together large fossil fuel-based developing and developed economies to \ndiscuss and collaboratively work on the early development of this key technology. Participation \nby  both  the  PRC  and  India  in  CSLF  also  strengthens  regional  cooperation  in  this  area. \nFinancing of CCS is proving to be a challenge in both developed and developing countries, due \nto  the  high  costs  and  risks  associated  with  CCS.7 The  challenge  is  more  pronounced  in \ndeveloping countries due to the absence of regulatory requirements and economic incentives.8 \nThe  task  force  (para.  1)  was  set  up  under  the  CSLF  policy  group  to  formulate  policy \nrecommendations  to  overcome  costs  and  associated  barriers  in  the  early  stages  of \ndemonstration projects in developing countries.9 The task force recognizes that multilateral \ndevelopment  banks  (MDBs)  have  a  crucial  role  to  play  in  identifying  appropriate  policy \nrecommendations and formulating low-cost funding mechanisms, due to the MDB\u2019s (i) perceived \nbalance and neutral approach on the critical issue of transfer of technology, and (ii) long-term \nengagement with developing countries. The task force aims to analyze key policy issues and \nbarriers and help accelerate formulation of creative policy recommendations, which can then be \nsubmitted to the policy group for further consideration and possible inclusion in the CSLF \nministerial meeting in October 2009.  \n \n6.  Recognizing the direct relevance of CCS, both in coal-based power plants in the PRC \nand India and more generally in Asia and the Pacific, ADB is already ahead of other MDBs in \nformulating suitable interventions in the region, particularly in the PRC.10 India has shown strong \ninterest in CCS-related activities, as illustrated by its active and prominent role in CSLF. The \nproposed TA strongly supports the energy sector policies and climate change agenda of ADB.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Coal-based power plants emit about 6 million tons of CO  per year for each gigawatt of power generated.  \n2\n7  Based on various studies by international institutions, the cost of a coal-based power plant with CCS increases by \nas much as 80% compared to without CCS.  \n8  Under the existing Kyoto Protocol, developing countries have no mandatory emission reduction targets. Moreover, \nat the moment, CCS is not an eligible technology under the Clean Development Mechanism.  \n9  India is the chair of the CLSF financial issues task force.  \n10 In the PRC, the 250 megawatt Tianjin integrated gasification combined cycle power plant is included in the country \noperations business plan (under preparation) for an ADB loan of $150 million. A complementary TA of $1.25 million \nis being finalized for Strategic Analysis and Capacity Strengthening for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage in the \nPRC.    \n ", "3 \n7.  The timing of CCS deployment is critical, and demonstration of CCS in major coal-\nconsuming developing countries such as the PRC and India will need to be brought forward so \nthat the time lag between proving CCS in developed countries and its uptake in developing \ncountries can be minimized. The global CCS community recognizes that appropriate low-cost \nfinancing and rapid transfer of technology to developing countries are critical issues in moving \nforward with CCS. In particular, there is an urgent need to strengthen the analysis of CCS-\nrelated global issues such as (i) intellectual property rights (IPRs)-related policies and incentive \nmechanisms to bring CCS technologies to market in developing countries; (ii) the rationale for \nadditional  investments  in  new  capture-ready  power  plants  to  avoid  carbon  lock  out,  and \nassessment of elements of additional capture-ready costs and their estimation in developing \ncountries; (iii) estimates of the need for financing concessions, (and their level and makeup, if \nneeded) for with-CCS and capture-ready projects, and assessment of existing and emerging \nMDB clean energy funds and their direct relevance in providing low-cost funding and risk \nsharing for CCS demonstration; (iv) assessment of ways to reduce trade barriers surrounding \nCCS technology in international trade negotiations, and to assess possibilities and ways of \nclassifying CCS in the World Trade Organization in order to benefit from the proposed reduction \nin tariffs for environmental products; (v) an assessment of the interest by MDBs in investments \nin CCS demonstrations; and (vi) evaluation of policies needed to seek private investments in \nCCS projects.   \n \n8.  While suitable in-country interventions are being designed to address capacity issues \nand country-specific barriers (para. 6; footnote 10), there is an urgent need to address the \nglobal issues in parallel to keep the CCS agenda on target. The proposed regional policy and \nadvisory TA will analyze these issues in greater depth and in the perspectives of developing \ncountries, and make recommendations to an international body such as CSLF. It is expected \nthat lowering these critical barriers may provide opportunities to accelerate CCS deployment in \nthe PRC and India.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be an established financing roadmap for CCS demonstration in \ndeveloping countries. The TA outcome will be formulated recommendations to overcome key \nglobal barriers in CCS demonstration in developing countries.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The key outputs of the TA will be (i) analysis of IPRs issues from the perspectives of \ndeveloping countries (PRC and India), (ii) identification of innovative and low-cost financing \napproaches, (iii) examination of appropriate classification of CCS to reduce trade barriers, and \n(iv) formulation of recommendations on enabling policies for seeking private investment in CCS \ndemonstration  and  deployment.  The  TA  outputs,  including  the  financial  roadmap  with \nassociated  policy  recommendations,  will  be  summarized  and  consolidated  in  a  knowledge \nproduct. A knowledge dissemination program with due consideration to similar international \ninitiatives will be designed and implemented before the TA is completed, the details of which will \nbe finalized in consultation with the CSLF secretariat during TA implementation.    \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n11.  A stakeholder network will be established in the initial stages of TA implementation, and \nclose coordination will be maintained throughout implementation with the CSLF secretariat and \nthe  stakeholder  network  to  ensure  that  the  TA  takes  into  account  relevant  studies  and \n ", "4 \n \ninternational experience in formulating recommendations. When a preliminary structure and \noutline of the recommendations are available, consultants will use the information flow from the \nTA tasks to further refine the recommendations.  \n \n12.  The key assumptions and risks are included in the design and monitoring framework in \nAppendix 1. Since the CCS is in the early stages of development, with uncertain economic \nrationale and incentives in developing countries (footnote 7), the major risk is that due to diverse \nand irreconcilable views among task force members, it may take considerable time and effort\u2014 \nlikely  extending  beyond  the  TA  implementation  phase\u2014to  arrive  at  a  consensus  on  the \nrecommendations. Similarly, it is not practically possible to hold individual discussions with each \ntask force member to seek their views on TA activities. This has been factored into the TA \nimplementation  approach,  whereby  ADB  will  coordinate  directly  with  the  CSLF  secretariat, \nwhich in turn will coordinate with task force members as appropriate.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $350,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate \nChange Fund.11 It will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem for international experts, training, \nseminars,  and  conferences,  and  TA  administration  and  support  costs.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. Within ADB, the TA will be implemented by Energy \nDivision,  East  Asia  Department  in  close  coordination  with  Energy  Division,  South  Asia \nDepartment and Sustainable Infrastructure Division, Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment.  The  management  of  the  TA  will  have  a  three-tiered  structure.  A  study  team \ncomprising a team of international consultants will form the core team to carry out TA activities. \nThe study team will be led by a team leader, appointed from among the ADB staff and will be \nguided by the CSLF secretariat. To optimize resource utilization and strengthen implementation, \nthe  same  staff  member  will  serve  as  ADB  team  leader  and  lead  the  complementary  TA \nimplementation in the PRC (footnote 9).   \n \n15.  The TA will require 10 person-months of international consulting inputs in the following \nfour critical areas (2.5 person-months each): (i) IPRs issues, (ii) trade barriers, (iii) financial \nmodeling and analysis, and (iv) CCS technical analysis. The individual consultants will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Considering the timeline for delivery of TA outputs, advance \ncontracting will be used to recruit individual international consultants. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line \nwith the ADB's TA Disbursement Handbook.12  \n \n16.  The TA will commence in May 2009 and will be completed by December 2009. The \nconsultants  will  produce  a  draft  report  by  July  2009  that  will  be  circulated  to  the  CSLF \nsecretariat at least 2 weeks before a scheduled meeting of the task force. The consultants will \nattend the task force meeting and present their outputs and respond to comments received from \nparticipants. A final report addressing consolidated comments will be submitted to the CSLF \nsecretariat within 4 weeks of receiving consolidated comments. The consultants will assist the \n                                                 \n11 Established by ADB.  \n12 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.
