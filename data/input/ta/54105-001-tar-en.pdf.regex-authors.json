INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide advisory support to \nguide road subsector governance reforms in Uzbekistan, which will help strengthen relevant \ninstitutions, improve the country\u2019s road network, and make infrastructure assets more sustainable. \nThe TA is not included in the country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, 2020\u20132022.1 The \ngovernment requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the TA on 17 \nFebruary 2020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Inadequate trade competitiveness.  Uzbekistan located in the heart of Central Asia, is \ndoubly landlocked (as it is surrounded by similarly landlocked countries) and suffers as well from \ndeteriorating road infrastructure and cumbersome logistics processes. In 2018, the country \nranked 99th out of 160 ranked countries in terms of its logistics performance. The low ranking \n(120th) for timeliness of international shipments is attributable mainly to Uzbekistan\u2019s landlocked \nlocation, as well as inadequate logistics facilities and processes. The ranking for quality of \ninfrastructure remains low (77th) in 2018, although an improvement from 99th in 2016.3 \n \n3.  Capacity expansion and financing. Strong economic growth and a concomitant surge \nin traffic have led to the need to improve and expand the road network. To do this as efficiently \nand effectively as possible, Uzbekistan needs a prioritized road investment program that has a \nrealistic  financing  plan  and  addresses  the  management  of  climate  risk.  Funding  from  the \ngovernment and development partners is unlikely to meet financing needs, and the government \nwill need to explore the potential for public\u2013private partnerships and similar road construction and \nmaintenance arrangements. Road projects meeting public\u2013private partnership standards will be \nidentified through the overall road investment and financing strategy and action plan. \n \n4.  Need for road subsector reform. In 2019, the World Bank prepared a transport sector \npolicy strategy paper aimed to underpin the Transport and Logistics Strategy of the Government \nof Uzbekistan.4 The policy paper defined the components of a comprehensive strategy and \nidentified areas needing further analysis and refinement. The TA will complement the World Bank \npolicy paper by detailing areas in the road subsector for which the World Bank has provided only \ngeneral recommendations. This division of roles and tasks was discussed at a high-level transport \nsector coordination meeting held in Tashkent in January 2020 and endorsed by the government. \n \n5.  Institutional reforms. Significant road sector governance reforms have been enacted \nsince 2006, but further reforms are needed. The Ministry of Transport (created in 2019) is \nresponsible for transport sector planning, policy formulation, regulation, and oversight. The \nCommittee for Roads is the key road agency and responsible for the operation and maintenance \nof the network of common use roads. The Committee for Road\u2019s organizational structure may be \ncompared with a holding company, which does not deliver services itself, but exercises its \nresponsibilities through subsidiaries, of which it is the sole shareholder. The subsidiaries include \ngovernment departments as well as state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with various legal forms. \n \n1  The government request for the project emerged after COBP, 2020\u20132022. In country programming mission in April \n2020, the government reiterated its request, which is reflected in the Cabinet of Ministers\u2019 resolution. The project is \nincluded in the current year\u2019s non-lending products list in draft COBP, 2021\u20132023. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 April 2020. \n3  World Bank. 2018. The Logistics Performance Index and its Indicators. Washington, DC. \n4  World Bank. 2019. Uzbekistan - Building Blocks for Integrated Transport and Logistics Development. Draft November \n2019. \n ", "2 \nSteps have been taken to commercialize the SOEs, but many remain closely linked to the \nCommittee for Roads and the government. In order to improve sector governance and enhance \nefficiency and competition, the government is determined to privatize the SOEs. \n \n6.  Need for modern design standards. Uzbekistan\u2019s road design standards originate from \nstandards that prevailed in the former Soviet Union; they do not adequately reflect economic \nconsiderations, such as traffic volumes and loads, or adequately address emerging issues such \nas road safety, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The former Soviet Union standards \nare conducive to the overdesign of roads, and the ensuing robust designs are largely what have \nenabled Uzbekistan\u2019s roads to endure for many years despite inadequate maintenance practices. \nThe more densely trafficked international and national roads in Uzbekistan suffer from a backlog \nin periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. The share of roads in poor condition is rising, and \nmany are highly trafficked roads, making it urgent that robust pavement designs are introduced, \ncoupled with an improved maintenance regime. \n \n7.  Sustainability of the road assets. Government expenditures on roads are financed from \nseveral sources, none of which are directly earmarked for roads. None of the government taxes \napplied to road operation and maintenance act as a price that would reflect the impacts and costs \nassociated with road users\u2019 utilization of road pavements. Road infrastructure is among the \ngovernment\u2019s most valuable assets, but does not receive adequate maintenance financing; this \nstems in part from the limited budget allocated to road maintenance, and because of changes in \nthe Republican Road Fund resulting from a new (2019) presidential decree.5 Maintenance \nbacklogs are mounting, and in response, the government is considering introducing a road asset \nmanagement system. The TA will familiarize the Committee for Roads with the concept of road \nasset management and the requirements to introduce the system; the actual introduction of a \nroad asset management system would exceed the financial and time resources of the TA. \n \n8.  Road safety. There are an estimated 550 road fatalities in Uzbekistan per year, and the \nassociated costs equal about 1% of gross domestic product per year. Prerequisites for sustained \nroad safety improvements include a gender-inclusive information system for traffic monitoring, \nadequate engineering standards, enforcement of traffic rules, and improved driver behavior. \n \n9.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. Consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, the TA will \nhelp ensure sustainable infrastructure investments in a manner that also addresses climate \nchange issues.6 The approach to developing road designs will take into consideration potential \nimpacts from climate change, and will thereby improve road network resilience. The TA is also \naligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023, which recognizes \npublic  governance,  old  and  deteriorated  infrastructure,  and  constraints  to  private  sector \ndevelopment as key challenges.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) long-term prosperity driven by increased \ntrade competitiveness resulting from the development of viable and environmentally and socially \n \n5  Decree of the President of Republic of Uzbekistan No. UP-5890 dated 9 December 2019.

Output, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  The TA will support the design of priority reforms in the road subsector, and guide the \ngovernment in the initial implementation phases. TA activities have been designed according to \nfour criteria: (i) alignment with government priorities, (ii) harmonization with the support provided \nby  other  partners,  (iii)  likely  feasibility  of  interventions,  and  (iv)  synergies  with  other  ADB \noperations.  \n \n12.  Output: Road subsector development strategy and action plan developed. The TA \nwill produce a road subsector development strategy and an accompanying time-bound gender- \nand socially inclusive action plan to clearly lay out the priority reforms needed in the road \nsubsector and guide the government in their implementation. The strategy will outline enhanced \ninstitutional arrangements in the road subsector, including the roles and responsibilities of existing \ngovernment institutions as well as the private sector. It will also generate options for further \ndevelopment  of  subsector  institutions.  The  TA  will  identify  appropriate  road  maintenance \nstrategies  for the  Committee  for  Roads  and  identify modern  road cross  section  with  road \ninfrastructure. It will also include a methodology for prioritizing investments in the road subsector, \nand articulate additional financing options for private sector investments. The action plan will be \nmonitored  closely  by  the  government  using  a  monitoring  framework  containing  key  sex-\ndisaggregated performance indicators. \n \n13.  The TA will build on the work completed through ADB\u2019s previous and ongoing support10 \nto the Uzbekistan road sector.11 Evaluation of previous TA support for governance reforms has \nhighlighted that successful reform requires time and flexibility.12 The TA will propose innovative \nplanning, design and state-of-the-art construction techniques in road infrastructure, and propose \nchanges in existing codes, standards and specification being used  by the Committee for Roads. \nThis is reflected in the indicative TA implementation period. Moreover, an interactive approach \nthroughout implementation will ensure government ownership of the results. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB.13 The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA and will have full responsibility for disbursement of TA funds. \nThe Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will \nselect, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize workshops; and provide quality assurance \nand coordination of all TA inputs. The Committee for Roads will act as the executing agency, with \nthe Republican Road Fund as the implementing agency. The Ministry of Investments and Foreign \nTrade  will  chair  a  steering  committee  comprising  senior  representatives  from  relevant  line \nministries, the implementing agency, and transport system users. The main tasks of the steering \ncommittee will be to (i) oversee the development of a shared vision and clear policy objectives, \n(ii) provide overall guidance to the consultant team, (iii) make key decisions, and (iv) approve the \naction plan once completed. \n \n16.  ADB will coordinate all TA activities closely with the Government of Uzbekistan, notably \nwith  the  Committee  for  Roads  and  the  Ministry  of  Investments  and  Foreign  Trade.  The \ndevelopment partners\u2014including the World Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and \nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\u2014will be briefed from time to time on TA \nimplementation progress.  \n \n17.  The consultant team will closely work with the Committee for Roads and the steering \ncommittee to carry out the tasks assigned to them. Each international expert will be matched with \na national expert; a total of 12-person months of international expert services and 14-person \nmonths of national expert services will be recruited to implement the TA. \n \n18.  The consultants will be selected and engaged as individual consultants. This selection \nmodality will address the government\u2019s need for an expeditious and custom-tailored delivery of \nthe TA outputs. The Committee for Roads, based on the understandings reached with ADB and \nother development partners, had made a commitment to the Ministry of Transport to submit the \nconsultants\u2019 recommendations by October 2020. \n \n19.
