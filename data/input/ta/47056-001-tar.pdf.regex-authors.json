INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Innovative \nModels for Climate Change Financing. Following a fact-finding mission in October 2013, ADB \nand  the  government  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  implementation \narrangement, costs, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth has exerted enormous pressure on the environment. \nThe  12th  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  responds  to  these  pressures  by  supporting  the \ngovernment\u2019s  long-term  goal  of  environmentally  sustainable  growth.2 The  plan  places  high \npriority on developing modern clean energy and environment-friendly technologies, while pilot \ntesting  the  development  of  green  and  low-carbon  cities.  The  China  Clean  Development \nMechanism Fund (CCDMF) is one of the mechanisms mobilizing financing for these initiatives.  \n3.  The CCDMF was established in 2007 as the first national public fund dedicated to \nclimate change. Affiliated with the Ministry of Finance, it utilizes the state\u2019s portion of Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism transaction revenue.3 The fund supports domestic climate change-\nrelated  research  programs,  and  leverages  public  and  private  financing  for  climate  change \nefforts. The main products offered are concessional loans, equity investments, guarantees, and \ngrants. The CCDMF has three main focus areas: clean energy, renewable energy, and energy \nefficiency. By the end of 2012, the CCDMF had collected more than CNY12 billion in revenue, \nissued CNY3 billion in concessional loans for low-carbon projects in 17 provinces, and provided \nCNY495 million in grants to more than 200 research projects.4 \n4.  The CCDMF is strengthening its contribution through the adoption of innovative financial \ninstruments. In 2012, it joined a risk-sharing facility (put in place with the assistance of the \nInternational Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group) among the Bank of Jiangsu, the \nMinistry of Finance, and Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department. The facility supports energy \nefficiency and renewable energy projects in Jiangsu Province that borrow from the Bank of \nJiangsu by mitigating the default risk of borrowers. \n5.  Opportunities provided by the joint mobilization of public and private funds are also being \nexplored. With ADB support, in 2013 the fund examined the potential for a fund of fund (FOF) \napproach to climate change financing in the PRC that would use public funds to leverage private \nfunds.5 The FOF approach is an investment strategy of holding a portfolio of other investment \nfunds rather than investing directly in stocks, bonds, or other securities. Various types of FOFs \nexist, such as FOFs for mutual funds or for private equity funds. While the FOF approach is \nused widely internationally, it is still nascent in the PRC. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 December 2013. \n2  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2011.

Prepared under ADB. 2010. \nTechnical Assistance for Supporting Strategic Knowledge Products and Research Networking. Manila (TA 6428-\nREG).  ", "2   \n6.  CCDMF management guidelines allow it to invest in certain types of private equity FOFs. \nUnder  this  FOF  mechanism,  the  CCDMF  would  partner  with  domestic  and  international \nfinanciers  and  financial  institutions.  They  would  cooperate  to  establish  a  fund  focused  on \nclimate change and then appoint a fund manager on a performance basis. The fund manager \nwould provide specialist skills and experience in project identification and assessment. The FOF \nwould  pool  costs,  provide  for  a  high  standard  of  professional  management,  and  provide \ninvestors the benefits of economies of scale and asset-specific investment options. This would \nmake  the  financing  of  climate  change  projects  more  attractive  to  investors,  including  new \nsources  of  climate  change  financing  among  insurance  companies,  pension  funds,  large \nenterprises, and high-net-worth individuals.  \n7.  The  assessment  conducted  over  2013,  with  ADB  support,  concluded  that  the  FOF \napproach is technically feasible for the CCDMF. The assessment also outlined a design based \non international and domestic best practice. It was recommended that CCDMF allocate a share \nof its assets for a private equity FOF, and as a founding partner, continue preparations for a \nlaunch of the private equity FOF in cooperation with other investors and professional fund \nmanagers.    \n8.  The CCDMF is committed to drawing on international experience to develop additional \nmechanisms for encouraging public and private financing for climate change in the PRC.6 By \ndemonstrating the potential for innovative approaches to mobilizing funds from domestic and \ninternational  investors,  the  CCDMF  will  develop  its  role  as  a  mechanism  for  using  public \nfinancing to catalyze funds for climate change finance. \n9.  ADB has a long-standing engagement with the CCDMF. ADB played a crucial role in \nconceptualizing and establishing the CCDMF,  and helped the fund prepare its operational \nguidelines and  procedures.  Deliverables  of  TA  for  the  Establishment  of  the  Clean  Energy \nDevelopment Mechanism Fund, approved in 2006, provided the CCDMF a draft policy paper on \ninternal controls and governance structure, and a draft operations manual.7  \n10.  Follow-on TA approved in 2008 for capacity development of the CCDMF provided critical \ncapacity strengthening and helped the CCDMF move to the next stage of utilizing revenues in \nan efficient, transparent, and effective manner.8 The TA prepared relevant operational measures \nand handbooks for capital investment, risk management, and performance evaluation; drafted \nrelated  templates  of  legal  documents;  and  recommended  potential  climate  change-related \nfinancial instruments (i.e., equity investment, entrusted loan, portfolio guarantee, and financial \nproduct investment). Specific guidelines for project selection, review, approval, and performance \nevaluation were prepared. The TA also financed a management information system. \n11.  Continued support for the CCDMF aligns with the priorities of the country partnership \nstrategy, 2011\u20132015.9 The country partnership strategy positions ADB to continue playing a \ncatalytic role in the PRC\u2019s development process through (i) an enhanced focus on innovation \n                                                 \n6  Some potential models are introduced in: International Energy Agency. 2011.

ADB will, in particular, support the government\u2019s efforts to \nfoster a cleaner and more sustainable growth process, including promoting the development \nand institutionalization of green financing instruments. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The  impact  will  be  more  diversified  and  sustainable  financing  for  climate  change. \nPerformance will be measured by the leveraging by the CCDMF of new private or public \nsources of climate change financing by the end of 2017. The outcome will be consideration by \ndecision  makers  of  innovative  models  for  climate  change  financing.  Performance  will  be \nmeasured by the presentation to the CCDMF\u2019s governing body of an FOF or other innovation for \nclimate change financing by the end of 2015. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n13.  The TA will provide four outputs. It will build on earlier work to help the CCDMF prepare \nfor the launch of an FOF for climate change. The TA will also initiate preparations of additional \nfinancial innovations that will leverage private financing, and support outreach on the actions of \nthe CCDMF. \n14.  Output 1 will be the detailed design of an FOF for climate change and supporting \noperating  procedures.  Matters  to  be  addressed  by  the  detailed  design  will  include  (i) \ngovernance arrangements, (ii) how a fund\u2019s investment mandate will be aligned with investor \nneeds and then approved, (iii) the method for appointing independent fund managers, (iv) \nreporting  and  performance  assessment  arrangements,  and  (v)  potential  exit  strategies  for \ninvestors. The operating procedures will include a staff manual and draft agreements with fund \nmanagers. Requirements for additional capacity development of the CCDMF will be identified. \n15.  The FOF design and procedures will make maximum use of established, successful \nexamples. This will offer benefits in terms of quality and minimize the cost of preparation. The \nTA will draw on the design and procedures developed for the CCDMF, with ADB support, \nincluding the fund\u2019s own governance procedures and operations manual. The design will pay \nspecial attention to the requirements of international financial institutions. It will also draw on the \nprocedures  put  in  place  for  FOF  investment  by  PRC  financial  institutions  and  the  ADB-\nsupported Climate Public\u2013Private Partnership Fund.10 \n16.  Output 2 will be an assessment of the commercial viability of an FOF for climate change. \nIt  will  extend  the  initial  analysis  undertaken  of  the  FOF  approach  during  2013  through \nconsultation with potential financing partners, fund managers, and other market participants. \nThe consultation with potential investment partners will draw on the material to be prepared \nunder output 1 on how an FOF will operate. It will include interviews with fund managers who \nhave a good track record with the FOF approach in the PRC and elsewhere in Asia, including \nthe ADB-supported Climate Public\u2013Private Partnership Fund. The TA will help prepare a sample \nmemorandum of understanding for potential investment partners and assist in the testing of \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmarket interest in such agreements. The assessment will include advice on the ongoing actions \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nrequired to explore investor support. \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for Climate \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Fund. Manila. \n ", "4   \n17.  Output  3  will  be  the  preliminary  design  of  additional  innovative  models  for  climate \nchange  financing.  Up  to  four  additional  designs  will  be  prepared,  drawing  on  a  review  of \ninternational best practice and identification of the most feasible models for the PRC. The \nCCDMF will be consulted on the additional designs to be prepared, and the required level of \ndetail of the preliminary designs will be agreed with the CCDMF, taking into account the number \nto be prepared and the availability of resource material. This output will draw on an international \nstudy tour to be conducted by the CCDMF to at least two countries implementing innovative \nmodels  for  climate  change  financing.  This  consultation  with  equivalent  agencies  already \nimplementing such innovations is required to help the CCDMF quickly appraise the suitability of \nthe models to the PRC, identify key issues and lessons that the PRC should pay close attention \nto, and to guide the preparation of preliminary designs by the TA consultants.11 \n18.  The deliverables of outputs 1 to 3 will be discussed through workshops in the PRC with \npotential investors and other market participants, and be subject to review by international and \nnational experts. At least one workshop will be conducted in a financial center in the PRC\u2019s \ncoastal provinces. \n19.  Output 4 will be targeted, widely accessible knowledge products, such as short policy \nnotes or reports. The knowledge products will draw on the deliverables of outputs 1 to 3 and the \nCCDMF\u2019s response, and disseminate information on the preferred way forward for innovation in \nclimate change financing. The output will explore links with regional and international sources of \nknowledge and information such as the Asia Pacific Adaptation Network. \n20.  The TA will make maximum use of earlier TA and knowledge products supported by \nADB,  taking  care  to  add  value  and  avoid  duplication,  and  coordinate  with  ongoing  TA \nundertaken by ADB and other development partners. \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $350,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart staff, other services to \nconsultants, assistance in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n22.  The  CCDMF  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  will \ncoordinate with central or provincial government authorities and other stakeholders, and assign \ncounterpart staff to assist the consultants. The executing agency will supervise the day-to-day \nwork  of  the  consultants  and  take  overall  responsibility  for  training  programs,  seminars, \nworkshops, and international study tours. The TA will commence on 24 December 2013 and be \ncompleted on 24 December 2015. \n23.  The TA will engage one international consultant for a total of 2 person-months, and six \nnational consultants for a total of 16 person-months. No single firm can be expected to provide \nwell-qualified consultants for the full range of diverse skills required for the TA, so more than \none firm will be engaged. A firm will be engaged to deliver outputs 1 and 2, and a separate firm \n                                                 \n11  To ensure adequate understanding across the CCDMF, the study tour will include at least one representative of \nthree  of  the  CCDMF\u2019s  five  departments;  the  Research  and  Development  Division,  the  Finance  and  Risk \nManagement Department, and the Project Development Department. Participants will be at Director level or higher. ", "5 \n \nwill be engaged to deliver output 3. Output 4 will require a national consultant for 2 person-\nmonths. Given the small input, this consultant will be hired individually. The terms of reference \nfor all consultants are in Appendix 3. \n24.  A firm will provide the four national consultants required for outputs 1 and 2, and a \nseparate firm will provide the two consultants (one international and one national) required for \noutput  3.  The  firms  will  be  engaged  using  fixed-budget  selection  and  biodata  technical \nproposals. This recruitment method is justified as a precise definition of the terms of reference \nfor the studies is possible, and changes to the terms of reference are not expected during \nimplementation. The recruitment method is also justified because the budget available for the \nstudies is fixed in each case ($130,000 for outputs 1 and 2, and $115,000 for output 3) and \ncannot be exceeded, and the time and personnel inputs can be accurately assessed. If fixed-\nbudget selection is unsuccessful, the firms will be recruited through quality- and cost-based \nselection at a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. If no suitable firm can provide the required consultants \nin a timely manner, the consultants may be hired individually, subject to the appropriate ADB \napproval process.  \n25.  ADB will engage the international and national consultants, as well as any resource \npersons, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n26.  The CCDMF will coordinate with government authorities and other stakeholders, and \nassign  appropriate  counterpart  staff  to  assist  the  consultants.  The  executing  agency  will \nsupervise the day-to-day work of the consultants and take overall responsibility for seminars, \nworkshops, and international study tours. Each firm will conduct an inception, midterm and final \nworkshops. Additional workshops may be held as agreed by the CCDMF and the firm. \n27.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs, following the agreed timeline and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, the two consultant firms will separately submit an inception report, semiannual \nprogress notes, a midterm report, a draft final report, and a final report to the government and \nADB. The main mechanism to monitor and assess the TA will be TA review missions. The \nknowledge products created by the TA will be provided to the Ministry of Finance and ADB for \ndissemination to the government and, as appropriate, other stakeholders. \n28.  The TA is based on the assumption that the priorities for climate change financing \nremain as set out in the 12th Five-Year Plan and that the CCMDF remains a conducive platform \nfor financing innovation. Other key assumptions are that sufficient staff time can be made \navailable  for  TA  management  by  the  CCDMF;  that  market  participants  actively  engage  in \ndialogue on innovation in climate change financing; and that investors in existing FOF are \nprepared to share information on FOF designs and operating procedures. The key risks to \nsuccess are that complementary initiatives that may be required cannot be implemented on a \ntimely basis, and that suitable consultants cannot be identified in a timely manner. \nIV.
