The overarching objective of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), as defined by its \npoverty reduction strategy, is to reduce poverty in the Asia and Pacific region. A recent review of \nthe strategy underscored the need for ADB to sharpen its country focus by adopting a more \nresults-oriented  approach  to  operations,  providing  more  flexible  financing  modalities,  and \nimproving the skills mix of its staff to better address the changing needs of its client developing \nmember countries (DMCs). These initiatives form the core of ADB\u2019s reform agenda aimed at \nachieving greater development effectiveness. Since mid 2003, ADB has adopted managing for \ndevelopment results (MfDR) as an approach to help focus on outcomes that matter to DMCs.  \n \n2.  Improving development outcomes, as set out in the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), is clearly a shared responsibility of DMCs and their development partners. Of crucial \nimportance to ADB and other development partners is that, while we build our internal capacity \nfor  implementing  the  MfDR  approach,  we  also  develop  a  similar  capacity  within  DMCs. \nHowever, the challenge of building MfDR capacity in DMCs is a much larger and longer-term \nundertaking that is highly demanding, multi-faceted, and resource-intensive.  \n \n3.  ADB has taken a proactive role with results orientation within its South Asian DMCs1 with \nthe introduction of results-based country strategy and programs (RB-CSPs) and specialized \ntechnical assistance (please see details in Appendix 1). ADB is now interested in building on \nthese initiatives and in particular utilizing its resident missions to further strengthen the capacity \nof DMCs with whom RB-CSPs have been developed or will be developed. \n \n4.  The United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) is a valued \npartner of ADB and has in the past provided technical expertise to ADB\u2019s resident missions and \nheadquarters. DFID is also recognized for its strategic efforts to strengthen country systems for \npoverty monitoring. The partnership between DFID and ADB was further strengthened in May \n2005,  when  they  entered  into  a  formal  memorandum  of  understanding  that  outlined  three \nprincipal  areas  of  collaboration:  pro-poor  policy  development  and  implementation,  regional \nprograms, and collaboration at the country level. A main commitment under the memorandum is \nto support performance assessments and results-based management.2  \n \n5.  This regional technical assistance (RETA)3 proposes a collaborative program between \nDFID and ADB, the longer-term goal of which is to sustainably strengthen DMC capacity to \nimplement results-oriented approaches to poverty reduction. Both institutions are committed to \nthe Paris Declaration of March 2005, which envisages that DMCs assume ownership of their \ndevelopment strategies and associated operational frameworks (e.g., planning, budget, and \nperformance assessment). This RETA seeks to assess and then strengthen DMCs\u2019 capacity for \nresults orientation, which will eventually enable development partners to rely more confidently \non country systems for planning, strategy development, resource allocation, and accountability \nof development resources, thus allowing the delivery of more flexible and relevant forms of \ndevelopment  assistance.  The  RETA  has  been  developed  on  the  basis  of  a  series  of \nconsultations  between  the  MfDR  team  of  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Department  (SARD)  and  the \nresident missions, preliminary consultations with DMC governments, and consultations with \nDFID, taking into account the ongoing MfDR initiatives in ADB and its DMCs.  \n                                                 \n1  The South Asia Department (SARD) includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, \nand Sri Lanka, with resident missions in six of these countries, excepting Bhutan and Maldives. \n2  Memorandum of Understanding between the Asian Development Bank and the United Kingdom Department for  \nInternational Development. Memorandum of Understanding for Administrative Arrangements. May 2005. \n3   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 October 2005. ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  This section sets out the main issues to be considered in introducing MfDR to improve \npublic sector management. A DMC-specific set of issues for the three DMCs under this RETA \nwill be identified during the MfDR readiness assessment.  \n \nA.  Public Sector Performance Improvement \n \n7.  Improving overall performance and, in particular, public sector performance is seen as \nbeing critical to attainment of the MDGs.4 A number of initiatives are already underway in South \nAsia to improve public sector performance. These include results-oriented national poverty \nreduction  strategies  (NPRS);  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks;  reform  of \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations  such  as  fiscal  decentralization;  poverty  monitoring;  civil \nservice reforms; and anticorruption initiatives.  Strengthening results-based management across \nthe public sector can lead to sound public sector management by adding an important feedback \nloop  to  systems  of  policy,  planning,  resource  allocation,  and  operations  that  may  work  in \nisolation from each other.5\n \nB.  Accountability and Oversight Systems \n \n8.  While the strength of the oversight mechanisms varies considerably among countries, \nMfDR  can  provide  a  powerful  reporting  mechanism  that can  improve  the  accountability  of \norganizations and improve the rigor of the oversight function. Sharing information on the efforts \nmade by different agencies to improve performance has been instrumental in encouraging other \nagencies to also improve their performance. \n \nC.  Long-Term Commitment and Managing Expectations  \n \n9.  Long-term commitment, reflected in institutional systems that create demand for, and \nmake use of, output and outcome information, is vital to the successful implementation of MfDR. \nCommitment must survive shorter-term political changes. The introduction of MfDR, in this \ncontext, needs to be viewed as a major change initiative and as such requiring a change \nmanagement  strategy,  which,  inter  alia,  includes  setting  realistic  expectations  on  (i)  the \ntimeframe to be expected in implementing MfDR and (ii) regular communication across the \norganization (and not simply in terms of reporting up the hierarchy) on what is being achieved, \nwhat is not, and why. Setting and managing expectations is critical to success of MfDR.  \n \nD.  DMCs\u2019 Capacity to Mainstream MfDR \n \n10.  Developing capacity to strengthen performance includes the gamut of skills from data \ncollection, monitoring, evaluating, financial management, specialized analytical and technical \nskills, and the ability of management to make decisions based on information derived from \nmonitoring. Capacity strengthening for MfDR is needed with respect to two key areas: an \nactivity\u2019s  efficiency  (is  value  for  money  increasing?)  and  effectiveness  (are  we  achieving \nintended outcomes?). Public sector agencies usually factor in equity and financial sustainability \nconsiderations as other important indicators of their performance.  \n                                                 \n4  This has also necessitated rethinking the role of the government in view of successful community initiatives for \nservice provision. \n5  For instance, improving labor productivity will require close coordination between agencies responsible for health, \neducation, and training services as well as private sector employers. \n ", "  3\nE.  Culture of External and Internal Information Sharing  \n \n11.  A  need  also  exists  for  mechanisms  of  stakeholder  feedback  on  the  reliability  and \ncoverage of public services and the efficiency of delivery systems. A parallel need is to establish \nan  organizational  environment  of  free-and-easy  information  sharing  that  encourages  the \nexchange  of  ideas  and  values  teamwork.  Incentive  mechanisms  need  to  be  in  place  to \nencourage efforts to achieve interagency collaboration.  \n \nF.  Management Information Systems and E-Government  \n \n12.  To make timely, accurate, and informed decisions, either for public policy or operational \nimprovements, management needs functional information systems. Many governments have \nused information and communications technology (ICT) for timely information sharing among \nemployees, to increase citizens\u2019 access to information on government services, and to allow \nelectronic transactions. ICT can also play a critical role in supporting MfDR when used to \nsupport  personnel  performance,  monitoring  and,  later,  evaluation  of  government  services. \nThese two systems are discussed separately below. \n \n13.  Supportive Personnel Performance Systems. Human capital is increasingly proving \nto be a critical factor for sustainable development and determining a country\u2019s comparative \nadvantage.  Therefore,  it  is  imperative  that  human  resources  employed  by  an  organization \nunderstand  and  work  towards  common  performance  targets,  and  that  suitable  personnel \nperformance systems are in place to ensure this.  \n \n14.  Monitoring and Evaluation Systems. As in any major initiative involving structural and \nsystemic changes, the need is well understood for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems to \nassess \u201cwhether we are on track.\u201d However, what makes a results-based M&E system different \nfrom  traditional  M&E  systems  is  that  the  former  goes  beyond  monitoring  implementation \nprogress\u2014i.e., from inputs to outputs\u2014and asks what the intended and unintended outcomes \nand impacts of these actions are; why they have occurred; and what implications they have for \npublic policy, investments, and the manner in which implementation progress is assessed. Good \nM&E systems benefit from robust statistical systems. Building and maintaining such systems \nrequires sustained effort as they provide the information that is critical for the feedback loop to \ncontinually improve performance. \n \nG.  ADB\u2019s Capacity to Support MfDR \n \n15.  Within the ADB, MfDR has been introduced to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness \nof operations.  ADB is committed to  \n \n(i)   a results-based framework to support performance-based resource allocation;  \n(ii)   improving  performance  monitoring,  measurement,  and  management,  with \nsupport from independent Operations Evaluation Department;  \n(iii)   harmonizing  efforts  and  developing  stronger  partnerships  to  improve \ncollaboration in operations, planning, financing and evaluation; and  \n(iv)   improving internal governance and management systems.  \n \n16.  A key element of improving ADB\u2019s performance is to continue strengthening the capacity \nof  its  resident  missions  and  sector  divisions  to  better  plan,  design,  monitor,  and  assess \noperations with a focus on results. \n   ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The expected impact over time of this RETA is to contribute to holistic poverty reduction \nas  reflected  in  the  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  in  Nepal, \nBangladesh,  and  Pakistan.  This  will  be  done  through  ADB\u2019s  resident  missions,  in  close \ncoordination  with  the  local  DFID  offices  and  other  development  partners  to  help  develop \nsustainable country capacities for the application of results-oriented approaches to poverty \nreduction within the framework of each country\u2019s own system. Appendix 2 presents the design \nand monitoring framework for the RETA.  \n \n18.  The main intended outcome of the RETA is that these three DMCs adopt MfDR as an \nexplicit public sector management practice. The expected outputs and key deliverables of this \nRETA are (i) MfDR readiness assessment, (ii) MfDR strategy and implementation plans, and (iii) \nMfDR mainstreamed under ADB-financed pilot initiatives.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n19.  MfDR Readiness Assessment.  A readiness assessment will be undertaken by each \nDMC government with support from development partners to map existing MfDR systems in the \ncountry  and  activities  of  other  donors,  based  on  consultations  with  a  broad  spectrum  of \nstakeholders. The assessments will focus on the following broad categories: (i) commitment, \nleadership, and ownership; (ii) clarity of objectives and performance standards based on client \nneeds;  (iii)  linkages  between  plans,  budgets,  and  actions;  (iv)  institutional  structures;  (v) \nmanagement  information  systems;  (vi)  feedback  to  decision-making  mechanisms;  (vii) \nperformance accountability systems; and (viii) stated culture and values and actual practices.  \n \n20.  MfDR Strategy and Implementation Plans. Based on the findings of the readiness \nassessments, and on the interest expressed by some or all of the three DMC governments to \ncarry  this work  forward,  an  MfDR  strategy  and  fully  costed  implementation  plan,  with  key \ninitiatives, will be developed by the governments to help identify (i) the objectives of each \ngovernment\u2019s adoption of MfDR; (ii) its strategy for introducing this by building on ongoing \nreform initiatives to support NPRSs; (iii) capacity building needs for MfDR; (iv) institutional \narrangements for results-based decision making and resource allocation; and (v) strategies for \nsharing experiences with development partners and regional DMCs.  DFID\u2019s country offices in \nthe DMCs covered by the RETA will be closely consulted in this process. \n \n21.  MfDR  Mainstreamed  Under  ADB-Financed  Pilot  Initiatives.  While  output  2  will \ninclude  recommended  changes  at  the  whole-of-government  and  cross-sectoral  levels, \naccompanied with a multidonor financing plan for the longer term, it would be cost-effective to \nbegin  testing  some  readily  implementable  initiatives  to  improve  performance  under  ADB-\nfinanced projects. Emerging lessons under these initiatives will be used to refine the DMCs\u2019 \nMfDR implementation plans and will contribute to SARD\u2019s own strategy for mainstreaming MfDR \nin  its  operations.  Implementation  of  these  pilot  initiatives will  be closely  monitored  to  fully \nunderstand the types of resistance and bottlenecks MfDR initiatives can face, and the lessons \nlearned will be used to draw a carefully phased implementation plan for future interventions. \n \n22.  Outputs 1\u20133 comprise the design phase of the overall program to support mainstreaming \nof MfDR in DMCs. It is anticipated that this RETA will be followed by an implementation phase \n ", "  5\nthat will aim to roll out the implementation plans developed under this RETA. In addition to ADB, \nthe support of other development partners will be solicited for the implementation phase. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n23.  An estimated $1.9 million will be needed to support the initiatives under this RETA. Of \nthis amount, $1.8 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund administered by ADB to cover the costs of the international expert for 18 person-months \nand 42 person-months of local expert services per DMC. A detailed cost estimate and financing \nplan is included in Appendix 3. DMC governments are expected to contribute $100,000 in costs \nfor consultations with counterpart staff at different levels of government, office accommodation, \nutilities, and miscellaneous expenses. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  This RETA will be implemented over 22 months, from March 2006 to December 2007. \nADB will serve as the Executing Agency, and SARD\u2019s Operations Coordination Division (SAOC) \nwill be the Implementing Agency. The assignment will require hiring one international expert to \nbe located within SAOC at ADB headquarters and at least two local experts to be located in \neach of the three DMCs. Experts will be engaged as individual consultants and in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor the engagement of domestic consultants. The most suitable location of the local experts \n(initially proposed to be one in the government and the other in the local resident mission) will \nbe discussed with the governments during the inception mission. From January 2008, SARD \nintends to continue the position of the international expert/regional advisor, and one national \nofficer per DMC, under its approved staff complement. \n \n25.  The international expert will be responsible for developing the work plans of the local \nexperts, in close consultation with DMC officials, SAOC and country directors, and local DFID \noffices. Reporting requirements will be in the form of (i) quarterly updates from local experts to \nthe international expert (through their respective country directors), (ii) midterm progress report \nto ADB and DFID, and (iii) an assessment paper upon completion of the RETA to discuss \nachievements made and to give guidance on the design of the implementation phase. The \npreliminary terms of reference for the experts (Appendix 4) will be finalized during the inception \nmissions.  The  good  practices  learned  through  this  initiative  will  be  disseminated  through \ninternational conferences, publications, and informal seminars both internally and externally with \nother DMCs and development aid institutions.  Assistance to each participating DMC will not \nbegin until ADB receives a no objection from the government of the participating DMC. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n26.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,800,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nPoverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, for Mainstreaming Managing for Development Results in \nSupport of Poverty Reduction in South Asia. \n   ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSARD\u2019S EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE MORE POVERTY REDUCTION \nBY ENHANCING DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS \n \nA.  South Asia Department\u2019s Specific Agenda for Managing for Development Results \n1.  Considering  the  prominence  of  the  South  Asia  Department  (SARD)  in  total  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) operations, and in view of SARD\u2019s senior management being strongly \ncommitted to the principles of managing for development results (MfDR), SARD is strategically \nwell-placed to substantially contribute to the development of ADB\u2019s operational framework on \nresults-orientation.  SARD  is  therefore  developing  a  relevant  and  operationally  meaningful \nframework for MfDR, the main components of which include, inter alia, \n(i)  aligning the results agenda of ADB\u2019s operations in South Asia with the national \nstrategies of developing member countries (DMCs), harmonizing SARD\u2019s results \nagenda with those of other multilateral development banks and development \npartners in the region, and sharing lessons learned; \n(ii)  helping to develop or improve DMCs\u2019 capacity to adopt their own results-oriented \nplanning,  budgeting,  project  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation \nprocesses; \n(iii)  ensuring that all future country strategies and programs for countries covered by \nSARD, and the processes that culminate in the production of the documents, are \nfully based on results; \n(iv)  establishing a set of outcome and impact indicators for DMCs in South Asia that \nwould give direction to SARD\u2019s future operations by taking into account indicators \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), of the countries\u2019 own national \ndevelopment strategies, and of relevance to ADB\u2019s mandate; \n(v)  extending results-based management process to economic and sector work; \n(vi)  at  the  corporate  level  within  SARD,  creating  functional  systems  (information \ntechnology systems, administrative arrangements for country-specific monitoring \nand  reporting  frameworks,  human  resource  planning  and  personnel  matters, \namong others) for full implementation of SARD\u2019s results agenda; \n(vii)  ensuring  staff  awareness  and  buy-in  of  SARD\u2019s  results  agenda  through \nrecognition of good practices and initiatives; \n(viii)  building deep technical capacity in SARD staff, both at headquarters and in the \nresident  missions,  to  focus  on  results  in  projects,  sector  roadmaps,  country \nstrategy  documents,  and  technical  assistance  operations  through  regular \ntraining; \n(ix)  pilot  testing  and  defining  good  practices  for  various  aspects  of  operational \nplanning, processing, implementation, and monitoring, such as upgrading the \nfocus on results in project logframes and sectoral roadmaps; and \n(x)  assessing  the  needs  of  the  developing  member  countries  in  the  region  for \ncapacity building on MfDR. \n \n2.  SARD\u2019s  framework  on  MfDR  is,  first  and  foremost,  a  tool  to  deliver  better  poverty \nreduction results. Applying this agenda within an operational department as large and as active \nas SARD demands time and resources. That SARD is leading and piloting many of these \nactivities makes this undertaking even more challenging. \n \nB.  SARD\u2019s Initiatives to Improve Development Effectiveness \n3.  To achieve better development impact, SARD is working to (i) improve its future results \nby developing better planning, measuring, and monitoring systems for current operations and (ii) \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nimprove the results of current operations. SARD has so far taken the following initiatives and \nactions (many of which are currently being piloted in ADB) to enhance the development impact \nof its operations: \n   \n1.  Improving Future Development Outcomes \n \n4.  To improve future outcomes and impact, SARD has begun to plan future operations with \na stronger focus on expected results and plans to follow up on the implementation of these \noperations through results-based monitoring systems. \n \n5.  Results-Based Country Strategy and Programs. SARD has produced ADB\u2019s first pilot \nresults-based country strategy and program (RB-CSP) in Nepal, and two subsequent RB-CSPs \nin Bangladesh and Bhutan in which main development outcomes to which ADB is contributing \nwill be monitored with the help of clear and measurable indicators. What is more important is \nthat information gleaned from monitoring will be used to inform future decisions on resource \nallocation for the areas of focus of ADB\u2019s operations in these countries. \n \n6.  This  approach  is  particularly  noteworthy  for  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID) because monitoring of operations on the ground is one of \nstrong points of DFID and an area in which SARD could benefit from DFID\u2019s experience. It \nwould therefore be important for SARD and DFID to collaborate on monitoring development \nimpact achieved through implementation of RB-CSPs. \n \n7.  Developing Country-Specific Results-Monitoring Systems. SARD is fully aware that \nresults orientation of projects, sector roadmaps, and country strategies and programs will not \namount to much unless they are followed by appropriate systems and procedures to ensure \nmonitoring of implementation with an eye toward improving the feedback mechanisms that \ncould lead to improvements in future operations. However, these systems will need to be \ndeveloped in such a way that they reflect the specific capacity and needs of the country, \nactivities  of  other  development  partners,  and  the  characteristics  of  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  in  the \ncountry. Therefore, avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach, SARD has undertaken the task of \ndeveloping country-specific systems for M&E of its operations. \n \n8.  Internal Reorganization of SARD to Improve Development Effectiveness. In early \n2004, SARD reorganized itself to put in place the needed Development Effectiveness and \nResults  Management  Unit,  which  focuses  on  the  development  effectiveness  and  results \norientation of operations in South Asia. In this way, a coherent internal structure within SARD \nwas created to provide staff with technical advice and assistance to improve the results focus of \ntheir work. The unit helps staff in developing RB-CSPs, coherent results matrices for such \ndocuments, results-based sector roadmaps, and project logframes. It maintains an overview of \nthe evaluation results from ADB\u2019s independent Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and \nlessons of good practice developed through the Development Effectiveness Committee of the \nBoard of Directors. The unit is small, however, for such a large agenda. \n \n  2.  Enhancing the Development Outcomes of Current Operations \n \n9.  Measuring and monitoring development outcomes can lead to improving results of future \noperations.  However, SARD is also active in taking measures to improve the outcomes of \ncurrent operations. Some initiatives taken in this regard are the following: \n \n   ", "8  Appendix 1 \n10.  Quality Improvement and Assistance. SARD has established a quality assessment \nand facilitation system that sets department-wide performance standards and works to address \nconstraints in meeting those standards through active participation of technically qualified and \nexperienced staff.  \n \n11.  Program of Internal Capacity Building for Staff. In line with an ADB-wide program of \ncapacity building for staff on technical aspects of MfDR, SARD has initiated such a program \ninternally. The program works through regular discussions series, the issuance of guiding notes, \nand the review of project documents. Its objective is to bring as much focus on results as is \npracticable, into the processes that lead up to the approval of projects, as well as sector and \ncountry strategies. SARD\u2019s experience gained so far on good practices for mainstreaming \nresults orientation into operations are being shared with other regional departments of ADB with \nthe objective of wider replication of innovative pilot initiatives. \n \n12.  Participation in Partnerships. It is important not only to align ADB\u2019s efforts to improve \ndevelopment results with the efforts of its DMCs, but also to harmonize with the individual and \ncollective efforts of other development partners who are active in the field. Improving SARD\u2019s \nrole as a partner with other development partners and stakeholders is a key component of \nefforts to improve its contribution to development effectiveness and its own performance.  \n \n13.  One important challenge facing SARD is to create a system to help it better assess its \neffectiveness as a partner and the way it works with others to pursue development results. This \nincludes the way in which SARD exchanges information, the extent to which it can engage in \njoint activities such as joint reviews with other development partners, and the way in which its \nstaff are encouraged to work together with staff of partner development institutions and other \nstakeholders. SARD appreciates DFID\u2019s recent initiative to undertake an assessment of the \nMDBs\u2019 effectiveness. Lessons learned in that exercise will be valuable for SARD\u2019s efforts to \nbetter manage for development results. \n \n14.  Decentralization of Operations. SARD has applied ADB\u2019s policy on decentralization of \noperational responsibilities to the resident missions rigorously. All resident missions in SARD\u2019s \nregion, except Afghanistan, are now authorized to plan medium-term country operations and, \nincreasingly, to administer the resulting lending and non-lending operations. SARD is seeking \nnew ways to complement these responsibilities with the appropriate authority for decision-\nmaking on procurement.  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s policy on decentralization makes it more important to develop partnerships with \nother development partners, in particular with bilateral donors who have a substantial presence \nin the field and grassroots knowledge of development needs and systems.
