During the 2005 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to assist the China National Coal Association (CNCA) with a study of alternative \nlivelihood options to facilitate coal sector restructuring to be financed by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund.1 In May 2005, the Fact-Finding Mission was fielded to assess the results of \navailable  studies  and  determine  the  scope  of  the  TA.  The  Mission  held  discussions  with \nrepresentatives from the PRC Government and CNCA. Understanding was reached on the TA \ngoals,  purpose,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA is included in the country pipeline for 2005. The TA design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Coal accounts for about 63% of the PRC\u2019s primary commercial energy consumption and \nalmost all coal is produced domestically. In 2004, coal production in the PRC was about 1.9 billion \ntons; in 2005 it is expected to increase to about 2.0 billion tons in view of the PRC\u2019s projected \neconomic growth. In general, coal mining is undertaken in three types of mines: (i) key state-owned \ncoal mines (KSOCMs), (ii) local state-owned coal mines (SOCMs), and (iii) town and village coal \nmines (TVCMs). It is estimated that in 2004, KSOCMs, which include large, mechanized coal \nmines, produced about 50% of the total coal production in the PRC, SOCMs produced about 17%, \nwhile TVCMs and illegal small coal mines produced about 33%.2 Small coal mines\u23afdefined as \nmines that  produce not more than 300,000 tons of coal a year\u23afcomprise about half of the \nSOCMs, most of the TVCMs, and all illegal coal mines, and employ about 2 million miners. The \ncoal industry also contributes significantly to the nation\u2019s employment and social stability with about \n8 million registered coal miners. Half of this number are relatively poor miners who work under \nrelatively dangerous working conditions in labor-intensive coal mines, which are operated at the \ncounty level and below. \n \n3.  To further develop its coal resources, the Government is giving priority to the construction \nof large, mechanized mines3 and the modernization and production improvement of existing large \nand medium-sized coal mines. At present the 10 largest KSCOMs account for less than 15% of the \nPRC\u2019s total coal production. To reduce the risk of any shortfall in coal supply, the Government aims \nto consolidate coal production by encouraging KSCOMs to acquire smaller and less efficient coal \nmines and form conglomerates with annual coal production of not less than 100 million tons. This \nmove is also expected to promote partnerships between foreign investors and the conglomerates \nand thus improve the latter\u2019s management capabilities, financial performance, and operations. With \nregard to small coal mines, the Government is pursuing the closure of mines that have failed to \nadopt required safety practices, operate without a license, or are considered illegal. ADB is also \nproviding  financial  assistance  to  the  PRC  for  the  establishment  of  a  coal  mine  methane \ndevelopment project4 that will apply the latest technologies for increased production, capture, and \nutilization of methane that becomes available during underground coal mining and thus improve \nmine safety by reducing the risk of underground methane explosions, reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, and improve the environment.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 7 April 2004. \n2  There are only a few private coal mines in the PRC. \n3  At present the construction of 25 coal mines with a total capacity of more than 60 million tons is being accelerated and \nabout 140 additional large coal mines are to be built in the next few years. \n4  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Coal Mine Development Project. Manila. ", "2 \n4.  Throughout the PRC there are about 57 coal-producing cities at the prefecture or municipal \nlevel.  Of that number, 47 depend on coal mining as their main source of income and function as \nde-facto state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The development of the coal industry has played an \nimportant role in the urbanization process in the PRC since traditionally, new municipalities were \nestablished for the development of KSCOMs and their population would be largely dependent on \ncoal produced by the KSCOM. However, about 20 cities out of the 47 largely dependent on coal \nmining as their main source of income are experiencing sharply decreasing coal reserves including \n14 that have nearly exhausted all their coal reserves. New coal production is being planned and \nstarted in new areas outside the 47 cities, which eventually will all experience dwindling coal \nreserves and an immediate requirement to diversify their economy. The total population in the \n47 cities is estimated at about 10 million, about 2 million of whom work in coal mines. The decline \nof coal mining in the 14 cities has already led to serious economic and social problems such as \n(i) increasing numbers of unemployed coal miners, particularly those that lack skills to be employed \nin KSCOMs elsewhere; (ii) increasing demands on the local government for re-employment of laid-\noff coal miners, provision of social services, and creation of new livelihood options for them; \n(iii) decreased revenues for the local government; (iv) difficulty in restructuring urban economies \nand attracting new investments due to lack of experience; and (v) usually poor environmental \nconditions after termination of coal mining operations and abandonment of coal mines. \n \n5.  At the same time, the Government has intensified its efforts to close small coal mines, \n\u23afparticularly illegal ones and those that produce less than 90,000 tons a year\u23afin view of their \nvery dangerous working conditions and the considerable environmental damage they cause. ADB \nwith  financial  assistance  from  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  is  supporting  the \ndevelopment of a model socioeconomic and environmental mitigation program to address the \nunemployment and environmental problems caused by the closure of small coal mines in Shanxi \nProvince.5 In the 47 cities, mine closure has further contributed to (i) considerable reduction of \nrevenues  collected  from  small  coal  mines  by  concerned  local  authorities;  and  (ii)  higher \nunemployment of miners who are relatively poor and unable to take up their previous job of farmer. \nConsequently, if alternative livelihood options are not created in these cities, poverty and social \ninstability are likely to increase to unacceptably high levels. Also, in the absence of alternative job \nopportunities, laid-off miners may seek employment in the small, illegal coal mines that are to be \nclosed by the Government. \n \n6.  The cities with depleting coal reserves are also gradually experiencing (i) annual reductions \nin income from coal mining and decreasing funds for safety expenditures; (ii) increased need for \ngovernment  support  to  provide  social  welfare  and  pension  payments  to  laid-off  miners; \n(iii) difficulties  in  continuing  coal  production  in  accordance  with  government  regulations  and \nstandards; (iv) uncertainty for the concerned local government as to how to gradually wind down \ncoal mine operations and abandon the mines safely; and (v) increasing demands for environmental \nrehabilitation, maintaining social stability, and reducing poverty in their cities following closure of \ncoal mines. In this context the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) of the PRC has expressed its \nconcern that four major problems in the PRC\u2019s mineral sector need to be urgently addressed to \nensure its sustainable further development. The problems are (i) restructuring of the coal mining \nindustry, (ii) development of additional coal mines, (iii) safety of coal miners, and (iv) economic \nrestructuring of cities that are largely dependent on coal mining for their revenues. According to \nNPC,  these  problems  are  directly  related  to  the  prospects  of  the  PRC  for  successful \nindustrialization, modernization, and urbanization, and to the welfare of millions of urban residents. \n \n7.  Traditionally, the Ministry of Coal Industry was responsible for the PRC\u2019s main coal mines, \noperated as SOE\u2019s that guaranteed stable wages and pensions for the employees and provided \n                                                 \n5 `ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Poverty Reduction in Coal Mine Areas in \nShanxi Province. Manila. ", "  3 \nthem with housing, education, and medical care.  However, the ministry was abolished in 1996 and \nthe  responsibility  for  coal  mining,  including  the  KSOCMs,  was  delegated  to  the  concerned \nprovincial governments while the Government maintained only a central supervisory role through \nthe State Administration for Coal Industry (SACI). Following further reorganization of the coal \nsector in 1998, SACI was also abolished and the Government remained involved only in the \noccupational safety aspects of the coal sector through the State Administration of Work Safety \n(SAWS). In February 2005, SAWS became a cabinet-level department headed by a minister and \nwas renamed as State General Administration of Work Safety (SGAWS). Within its organization a \nseparate State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS) was established. The main objective \nof SACMS is to reduce the increasing number of accidents in underground coal mines in the PRC, \nwhich each year result in the death of more than 7,000 miners.  \n \n8.  SACMS is planning to improve safety conditions in coal mines by (i) enforcing regulations \nfor closure of unsafe coal mines and issuance of coal mine safety licenses, (ii) financing safety \nequipment and devices, and (iii) capacity building at the local government level by conducting \nsafety training programs for mine safety supervisors.6 At the national level, CNCA represents more \nthan 1,000 coal mines operating in the PRC and is closely associated with the National Center for \nInternational Exchange on Work Safety (Coal Mine Safety) or NCICS and SACMS. Both CNCA \nand NCICS act as focal points for overseas assistance in improving coal mine safety,7 increasing \nthe efficiency of coal mining, and reducing environmental and social impacts associated with coal \nmining operations in the PRC. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n \n9.  The objective of the TA is to assist CNCA with developing and applying of a methodology \nfor identifying alternative economic activities for cities that depend on coal mining as their main \nsource of income and are experiencing decreasing coal reserves. Such alternative economic \nactivities will be based on the cities\u2019 comparative economic advantage in these activities, enable \nthem to restructure their economies, and provide alternative livelihood to redundant coal miners.  \nThe TA will also assess general investments and identify support programs, such as training, \ncredit, and technical extension services, that will be required for this purpose as well as policy \noptions for mitigating the social and environmental impacts that will occur in those cities with  \nclosure of the coal mines. The outline of corresponding model training and job creation programs, \nincluding their estimated cost, will be developed. A general national strategy for addressing the \nanticipated economic problems and social hardships in these cities within the context of the PRC\u2019s \noverall urbanization drive will be prepared. The findings of the TA will also be used for developing \nnational policies to enable timely economic restructuring of all cities that at present are dependent \non decreasing coal resources.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will be carried out in two phases. During phase 1, the consultants will gather and \nanalyze existing data on all cities that are largely dependent on coal mining as their main source of \nincome and are experiencing sharply decreasing coal reserves or are expected to experience this \nin the near future. In phase 2, the consultants will prepare a methodology for identifying alternative \neconomic  activities  in  those  cities  and  investments  and  other  support  programs  that  will  be \nrequired as well as policy options for mitigating social and environmental impacts. In this context \nthe consultants will also prepare case studies for two coal mining cities, one in the northeast of the \n                                                 \n6  The Government has allocated CNY3 billion (about $366 million) for these activities. \n7  To improve safety and health conditions in PRC coal mines, the United States Labor Department is providing technical \nassistance, which is financed by a grant of $2.3 million. ", "4 \nPRC and one in the south. During TA implementation the consultants will organize two workshops. \nThe first will be held at the end of phase 1 and will discuss the initial findings of the consultants; the \nsecond will be held at the end of the TA to discuss the prepared methodology for identifying \nalternative economic activities in the cities, required investments and support programs, policy \noptions for mitigating the social and environmental impacts, and outline model training and job \ncreation programs. To be invited are all stakeholders, including government organizations and \npolicy makers involved in restructuring the economies of the cities, representatives of coal mining \ncities, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA), \nMinistry of Construction (MOC), Ministry of Labor (MOL), State Assets Committee (SAC), State \nEnvironmental  Protection  Administration  (SEPA),  and  concerned  provincial  planning  and \ndevelopment commissions and other provincial agencies. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 2. \n \n11.  Key activities will include (i) making a detailed analysis of the economic and social structure \nof cities that are largely dependent on coal mining for their revenues and the impact of coal mine \nclosures on poverty incidence and the environment in those cities; (ii) evaluating the national and \nprovincial governments\u2019 efforts for economic restructuring of the cities within the framework of the \nPRC\u2019s overall urbanization program; (iii) identifying the most probable increases in poverty and \nenvironmental degradation over the next 5 years due to the closure of coal mines; (iv) developing a \nmethodology  for  identifying  alternative  economic  and  livelihood  activities;  (v)  assessing  the \nrequired investment and support programs for this purpose; (vi) identifying of past and present \ncommitments of the national and provincial governments vis-\u00e0-vis those cities; (vii) identifying  \npolicy options of the national and provincial governments for mitigating social and environmental \nimpacts in the cities due to closure of the coal mines, including suitable job creation mechanisms \nand training programs; (viii) formulating possible economic restructuring strategies for the cities; \n(ix) developing  model job creation and training programs to assist redundant miners, particularly, \nunskilled ones, to find alternative livelihood following closure of the mines; and (x) disseminating  \nthe results of the TA at the national level to promote their application in formulating corresponding \nnational and provincial policies. \n \n12.  The major risks in the successful implementation of the TA include inadequate counterpart \nsupport, lack of adequate data or its untimely provision, delayed submission of required studies, \ndelay in consultant selection, and poor consultant performance. In addition, support by national and \nconcerned provincial governments through creation of alternative economic activities in the cities \nand mitigating the social and environmental impacts of closure of the coal mines is necessary for \nthe success of the TA. Efforts will be made to ensure that competent international and domestic \nconsultants  are  recruited  on  time.  Close  coordination  among  the  consultants,  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 equivalent comprising foreign exchange of $200,000 \nand  local  currency  equivalent  of  $250,000.  ADB  will  provide  $300,000  equivalent  to  finance \n$200,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $100,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA \nwill  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  and  will  be \nadministered by ADB. CNCA will contribute $150,000 equivalent representing about 33% of the TA \ncost, to finance the remaining local currency cost. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  CNCA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB will select and engage the services of \ninternational and domestic consultants according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and ", "  5 \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  appointment  of  domestic  consultants.  The \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  economic,  social,  and  environmental,  and  social  analyses; \neconomic planning and restructuring; social and environmental impact assessment; social and \nenvironmental impact mitigation; and development of training and job creation programs for low-\nskilled workers in coal mining areas. An estimated of 22 person-months of consulting services \n(4 international and 18 domestic) will be required. The international consultants will include an \neconomist and a social protection expert (2 person-months each) while the domestic consultants \nwill include an economist, a poverty reduction expert, an environmental expert, and a training \nexpert (4.5 person-months each). In addition, the services of an international training expert will be \nprovided for 2 person-weeks to assist with developing model training and job creation programs. \nThe international economist will act as team leader. The consultants\u2019 services will be provided \nthrough  a  consulting  firm  comprising  international  and  domestic  consultants,  following  the \nsubmission of simplified technical proposals and the use of the quality-and-cost-based selection \nmethod. The TA is expected to be implemented over 6 months. \n \n15.  CNCA will establish a counterpart team comprising representatives of CNCA, NCICS, and \nSACMS. The counterpart team will work in close cooperation with the coal-dependent cities \nthat are affected by the closure of coal mines, particularly the two cities that are subject of the \ncase studies, and will report directly to the minister of SGAWS. CNCA will organize joint meetings \nwith  NDRC,  MOC,  MOCA,  MOL,  SAC,  SEPA,  and  the  concerned  provincial  planning  and \ndevelopment commissions to discuss the progress of the TA. It will also organize two workshops \nwith  their  participation as  well  as that  of  other  stakeholders  and  interested  parties,  including \nrepresentatives of affected communities and aid agencies. The TA will include a study tour of \nabout 2 weeks to Europe8 for two government officials to visit municipalities that experienced \nrecent  closure  of  their  coal  mines.  The  study  tour  will  be  organized  by  the  consultants  in \nconsultation  with  ADB.  CNCA  will  provide  interpreters,  local  transportation,  and  office  space \nequipped with suitable facilities in Beijing. Computers and other office equipment to be financed \nunder the TA will be procured by the international economist in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement and transferred to CNCA after completion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  to  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Alternative Livelihood Options to Facilitate Coal Sector Restructuring, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  Possible countries for the visit include Belgium, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.

Propose  job \ncreation programs, the technologies of environmental recovery, and policies and \nlaws related to reemployment and coal sector restructuring. \n \n(ix)  In consultation with ADB, organize a study tour to Europe for two government \nofficials to review government policies and actions taken to mitigate social and \nenvironmental impacts for municipalities that recently experienced closure of coal \nmines.  \n \n(x)  Organize the first workshop at the end of phase 1 and discuss the initial findings \nof the consultants. \n \n2.  Phase 2: Methodology for Identifying Alternative Economic Activities and \nInvestments and Other Support Programs \n \n5.  Using the results of phase 1, the consultants will do the following: \n \n(i)  Develop  a  methodology  for  identifying  alternative  economic  and  livelihood \nactivities, which would offer cities that depend on coal mining as their main \nsource  of  income  a  comparative  economic  advantage  and  enable  them  to \nrestructure their economies and provide alternative livelihood to redundant coal \nminers. \n \n(ii)  Assess the required investment and support programs for the purpose, including \nsuitable job creation mechanisms and training programs. Identify policy options \nfor  the  national  and  provincial  governments  for  mitigating  the  social  and \nenvironmental impacts of closure of the coal mines. \n \n(iii)  Considering international experience, analyze potential modes and methods for \nrestructuring and environmental protection. \n \n(iv)  Formulate possible economic restructuring strategies for the cities to address the \nanticipated economic problems and social hardships in the context of the PRC\u2019s \noverall urbanization drive. Propose national strategies for the development of \nmining cities in the next 10\u201320 years.  \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \n(v)  Develop a model for job creation and training programs to assist redundant, \nunskilled miners to find alternative livelihood activities following closure of the \ncoal mines. Develop the outline for the corresponding model programs, including \ntheir estimated cost.  \n \n(vi)  Analyze  the  economic,  poverty,  financial,  and  environmental  impact  of  the \nidentified  alternative  economic  and  livelihood  activities  in  the  pilot  cities  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines and methodologies. For analysis of the financial \nand financial management aspects, take into account \u201cFinancial Due Diligence - \nMethodology  Note  and  Financial  Management  Assessment  Questionnaire\u201d \nprepared by ADB. Establish and quantitatively evaluate the linkage between \nalternative economic and livelihood activities and poverty reduction. \n \n(vii)  Develop an effective monitoring and evaluation system by reviewing all related \ndocuments to determine a set of monitoring indicators for economic growth, \nenergy  efficiency,  institutional  reforms,  poverty  and  social  aspects,  and \nenvironmental improvement. Ensure that the indicators are appropriate for the \nmonitoring system\u2019s objectives, the main stakeholders, the speed with which the \ninformation  is  needed,  and  the  cost.  Develop  management,  monitoring,  and \ninspecting mechanisms. \n \n(viii)  Assess resource requirements and institutional arrangements for monitoring the \nTA  impact,  and  identify  skills  in  data  collection,  analysis,  and  reporting  and \nmanagement information system skills required to implement the monitoring and \nevaluation system. The consultants will identify the training requirements and \nprovide the necessary training on monitoring. \n \n(ix)  Organize the second workshop at the end of TA implementation to discuss the \nprepared methodology for identifying alternative economic activities in the cities, \nrequired investments and support programs, policy options for mitigating the \nsocial and environmental impacts, and outline model training and job creation \nprograms. \n \n(x)  Prepare two case studies, one for a coal mining city in the northeast of the PRC \nand one for a coal mining city in the south. Assess unemployment, economic, \nenvironmental,  and  social  issues  in  the  pilot  areas.  Develop  a  strategy  for \nrestructuring,  reemployment,  and  environmental  protection.  Assess  the \neconomic, environmental, and social impacts of the proposed strategy. \n \n(xi)  Hold a consultation workshop with all stakeholders to present the TA final draft \nreport with recommendations that include proposed implementation mechanisms \nand required capacities. Incorporate comments into the final report. \n \n(xii)  Disseminate the results of the TA at the national level to promote their application   \nin formulating corresponding national and provincial policies. \n \nB.  Reports \n \n6.  The consultants will submit the following reports: \n \n(i)  Inception report. The inception report will be submitted within 1 month after the \nTA starts. It will summarize the initial findings, and suggest changes needed (if ", "Appendix 2  11 \n \nany) in the TA\u2019s approach, methodology, and time schedule.  It will include a \nproposed outline of the final report \n \n  (ii)  Draft final report and the first workshop. The consultant will submit a draft \nfinal report, which CNCA and ADB will have 3 weeks to review. The draft will be \ndiscussed in the first workshop with the main stakeholders, counterpart team, \nand  key  officials  from  other  government  agencies  involved  in  sector \nrestructuring. ADB staff will participate in the workshop. The workshop\u2019s main \nobjectives are to (a) present TA findings and recommendations to policy makers \nand  stakeholders,  (b)  facilitate  idea  exchange  and  gather  comments, \n(c) increase a sense of ownership and commitment to the TA recommendations, \nand (d) allow policy makers to discuss stakeholders\u2019 feedback. \n \n(iii)  Final report and second workshop. The consultants will submit a final report, \ntaking into account the comments of CNCA and ADB on the draft final report and \ndiscussions during the second workshop.
