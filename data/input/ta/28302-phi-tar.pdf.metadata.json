INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Bank's Country Programming Mission in 1995, the Government of the\nPhilippines requested Bank advisory technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the Department of\nAgriculture's (DA) capabilities for policy formulation, planning, monitoring, and evaluation of\nprograms and projects in the agriculture sector. In response to DA's request, the Bank fielded\na Fact-finding Mission in September 1996 that reached an understanding with the Government\non the objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost-estimates and financing plan, and\nimplementation arrangements for the proposed TA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Medium Term Agricultural Development Plan (MTADP)2 of DA provides the\nframework for food security and overall development strategy for the agriculture sector. The\nenactment of the Local Government Code (LGC) empowers Local Government Units (LGUs) to\nperform functions related to agriculture at the barangay,3 municipality, provincial, and city levels.\nThe implementation of the MTADP is constrained by the limited institutional capacity of DA and\nLGUs to formulate and implement appropriate policies, plans, programs, and projects, and to\nmonitor and evaluate their implementation.\n3. The present interim organizational structure of DA consists of three\nUndersecretaries, three Assistant Secretaries, and six Services providing staff support at DA's\nCentral Office; seven Staff Bureaus; 11 Aft ached Agencies; and 11 Government corporations (see\nAppendix 1). Similarly, there are 13 Regional Field Units for agriculture representing the\nadministrative regions. The Regional Field Units serve as frontline agencies of DA because the\nprovincial and municipal agricultural offices have been devolved to the LGUs.\n4. Among the Services of DA, the Planning and Monitoring Service (PMS) has very\ncrucial and strategic functions. The PMS is responsible for the (i) formulation, analysis, and\nadvocacy of agricultural policies; (ii) preparation of strategic aricultural development plans; (iii)\ncoordination with field offices for the planning and implementation of agricultural development\nprograms; and (iv) review of work and financial plans for ongoing projects. The PMS is\ncomposed of six Divisions with 78 professional staff, namely, the Policy Analysis Division (PAD),\nthe Project Development and Evaluation Division (PDED),the Planning and Programming Division\n(PPD), the Project Packaging Division (PPD), the Research and Project Development Division\n(RPDD), and the Program Monitoring and Evaluation Division (PMED). Planning, Monitoring, and\nEvaluation Units (PMEUs) are located in the Regional Field Units. The major functions of the\nPMEUs are to (i) prepare regional development plans, and monitor and evaluate their\nimplementation; (ii) provide guidance to the provincial planning units; (iii) monitor and evaluate\nthe regional programs and projects; and (iv) develop and prioritize project proposals for\nimplementation in the regions.\n5. The DA is facing several major constraints in the formulation, planning,\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, programs, and projects. These include:\n(i) the absence of integrated and coordinated agricultural development plans at the regional and\nLGU levels; (ii) absence of a long-term agricultural strategy; (iii) inadequate data base and\ninformation system; (iv) the skills and capacity of PAD staff in several major areas of policy\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 1995.\nThe Medium Term Agricultural Development Plan (1993-1998), Department of Agriculture.\nSmallest administrative unit.", "2\nanalysis, formulation, and advocacy has not kept up with the increased and more complex\ndemands for agricultural policies at the (subsector) macro level, as also required for international\ntrade agreements and liberalization of the sector; (v) lack of skills and capacity in project\nplanning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation; and (vi) no clearly defined linkages and\nmechanisms for policy and project/program formulation and implementation between DA,\nPMEUs, and LGUs. These constraints, have resulted in poor implementation of agricultural\ndevelopment programs and projects.\n6. To increase the production and productivity of the agriculture sector, higher\ninvestment in the sector is needed. This requires corresponding improvement in capacity at both\nDA as well as the Regional Field Units and LGU level to formulate, plan, implement, monitor,\nevaluate, and manage projects especially if additional external sources are to be sought. In\naddition, DA needs to strengthen its capacity for agriculture sector policy formulation and\nadvocacy, and sector planning especially at the regional and provincial levels, involving LGU\nparticipation. For example, the current MTADP has been criticized for its inadequate consultations\nat the LGU level. For this reason, the DA central and regional offices have to build up their\ncapacity for a participatory approach for agricultural sector planning, which addresses the LGUs'\nparticular problems and needs.\n7. As a result of the LGC, expanded democracy and beneficiary participation, the\nplanning and decision-making mechanism has been broadened and has become more complex,\ninvolving other agencies and institutions. In addition, the liberalization of the agriculture sector\nand the international trade agreements has transformed agriculture from a closed to an outward\nlooking sector. However, PMS capabilities have not been strengthened to handle the more\ndemanding new tasks dictated by the rapid and complex change of the agriculture sector.\n8. The future requirements are twofold: (i) agriculture sector strategy and policy\nformulation, evaluation, advocacy, preparation for legislative action, and interaction with\nmacroeconomic policy are responsibilities mainly of DA requiring strengthening of PMS/PAD; and\n(ii) project planning, implementation, and evaluation are responsibilities mainly of the LGUs, to\nbe assisted and coordinated by DA. Because they lack the requisite skills, the role of the LGUs\nin the planning and implementation of the agricultural development programs and projects has\nbeen minimal. The success of the Government to develop the agriculture sector and to\ndecentralize the role and functions of central DA will depend on the successful involvement of\nLGUs in agricultural development. Essentially, the basis for decentralization has been laid down\nin the LGC, and the relevant organizational structures need strengthening to achieve the\nobjectives of decentralization. In view of the foregoing, there is an urgent need for technical\nassistance that will assist the Government to identify the organizational and administrative\nchanges required, and that will strengthen the institutional capability of DA to enable it to perform\nits new functions more effectively. In particular, there is an urgent need to strengthen the PMS,\nPMEUs, and LGUs in project planning and implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the\nimplementation of the MTADP, and to strengthen PAD for policy analysis, formulation, and\nadvocacy.\n9. The Bank's Country Assistance Plan for Philippine agriculture is aimed at\nincreasing efficiency and productivity through (i) human resource development, institutional\nstrengthening infrastructural development, and policy adjustments; (ii) improvement of the\nmanagement of natural resource endowments for increased sustainability; and (iii) poverty\nreduction. The proposed advisory TA has human resource development and institutional\nstrengthening as its central components and will increase the institutional capability in the context\nof devolution. During 1996, the Bank provided a regional technical assistance (RETA) for", "3\nevaluation of Bank assistance to developing member countries (DMCs) for benefit monitoring and\nevaluation.1 The RETA included five country studies (including for the Philippines) and two\nworkshops to review the existing systems utilized in DMCs for supervising, monitoring, and\nevaluation of project performance. One of the major conclusions of the RETA was that the Bank\nshould provide assistance to build capacity in DMCs for performance management.\n10. The TA will strengthen the capability of the DA to (I) fulfill its responsibilities and\nfunctions and improve the formulation and implementation of agricultural development plans,\nprograms, and projects; (ii) rationalize and restructure existing organizations and procedures; (iii)\nstrengthen its capability for policy formulation and implementation; (iv) improve its management\ninformation system; (v) improve the formulation and implementation of agricultural projects and\ninvolve the LGUs through a participatory process; and (vi) bring about increased levels of\nexternal assistance for agriculture.\nIll. THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n11. The objective of the proposed TA is to strengthen DA's capacity for sectoral\nagricultural policy analysis and advocacy, national and regional project and program formulation,\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation, and to develop a participatory modality involving the\n[GUs in the formulation of local agricultural policies, programs and projects, and their\nimplementation and evaluation. The proposed TA will focus on the strengthening of\norganizational arrangements and procedures, and human resources development.\nB.\t Scope\n12.\t The scope of work under the proposed TA wUl include the following:\n1.\t Institutional Assessment\n13. The proposed TA will review and make recommendations on the organizational\narrangements and on the role and functions of DA in policy formulation and advocacy, planning,\nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation of agriculture sector programs and projects. The\nassessment will include the Regional Field Units, and linkage of DA/PMS with the LGUs, taking\ninto account the changes of the role and responsibilities brought about by the devolution\nprocess. Coordinative linkages and interaction among the different DA units such as PMS, the\nBureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS), and Computer Services (CS) will be reviewed and\nproposals for improvements made.\n2.\t Strengthening Policy Analysis, Formulation, and Advocacy Capability\n14. The capability of PMS/PAD to analyze agriculture sector policy issues and to\nformulate and advocate policies to support legislative measures will be enhanced. The TA will\nprovide proposals on how this can be achieved, and will also develop guidelines and provide\nfor training by organizing training workshops.\nRETA No. 5636:Evaluation of Bank Assistance to DMCs for Benefit Monitoring Evaluation, for $450,000,\napproved on 22 June 1995.", "4\n3.\t Improvement in Project Planning, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation\n15. This activity has two distinct, but yet closely linked levels, namely: (I) at the sector\nand regional level, where the main responsibility and capability rest with DA/PMS and Regional\nField Units; and (ii) at the provincial level and below, where the responsibility lies with the LGU.\nFor the latter, DA/PMS through their Regional Field Units will provide advise and assistance to\nthe LGUs, and also will ensure proper linkages to and from the DA sector plans and programs\nto facilitate coherence and integration. At DAJPMS, Regional Field Units as well as at selected\nLGUs, training will be provided to enhance the agricultural planning, programming, monitoring,\nand evaluation capability. At the LGU level, present procedures will be reviewed and proposals\nwill be made for a participatory planning and implementation modality.\n16. During the Pilot (implementation) Phase, and as part of the training and testing of\nproposed modalities, assistance will be provided in the actual formulation of projects and\nprograms at selected LGUs, as well as for the preparation of selected provincial and regional\nagriculture sector programs. Manuals and guidelines will be prepared for participatory project\nplanning, monitoring, and evaluation. Through feedback during the Pilot Phase, the modalities\nwill be refined, and a comprehensive proposal prepared for nationwide implementation.\n4.\t Improvement of the Management Information System\n17. Existing procedures adopted by DA/PMS for the collection of agricultural data and\nstatistics, their compilation, analysis and interpretation will be reviewed. Performance indicators\nfor DA's programs and their evaluation will be established. The institutional arrangements for data\ncollection will be reviewed including the function and role of PMS vis-a-vis BAS. A computerized\nmanagement information system will be formulated and tested during the Pilot Phase.\n5.\t Human Resource Development\n18. In addition to on-the-job training and training workshops to be held under the\nactivities above, a comprehensive human resource development program for DA/PMS staff will\nbe prepared at both Central and Regional levels, and for selected LGUs. Training courses will\nbe organized (using the services of appropriate national institutions and resource persons) for\nDA/PMS staff and selected LGU staff. The training will cover key areas of policy analysis and\nadvocacy, planning, programming, sectoral review, project analysis and implementation, and\nmonitoring and evaluation, including economic and financial analysis of agricultural projects.\n19. Some equipment (e.g., computers/compatible electronic data processing\nequipment, supplies for data analysis and monitoring) and a vehicle that are required for training\nand field work will be provided. This equipment and vehicle will initially be utilized for the training\nprograms and, thereafter, be assigned to the PMS for continuation of the activities nationwide\nafter completion of the TA.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n20. The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $1 ,21 2,000 equivalent of which\n$536,000 is the foreign exchange cost and $676,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The\nBank will provide $976,000, on a grant basis, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and a\npart of the local currency amounting to $440,000 equivalent. The Government will meet the\nremaining local currency cost of $236,000 equivalent for expenditures (in cash and kind) for", "5\nremuneration, per diem, domestic travel cost, and counterpart staff; training facilities and office\nspace, operating cost, and support staff (see Appendix 2).\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n21. The Executing Agency for the proposed TA will be DA. DA will provide full-time\ncounterpart professional and support staff from the PMS and will provide required logistics\nsupport. The Assistant Secretary for Policy and Planning will serve as Program Director for the\nTA and will be responsible for overall coordination. A Steering Committee, chaired by an\nUndersecretary of DA and including representatives of PMS, National Economic and\nDevelopment Authority (NEDA), Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Interior and Local\nGovernment (DILG), Regional DA, and selected LGUs will provide guidance during TA\nimplementation.\n22. The proposed TA will be carried out by a team of five consultants from a\nconsulting firm, selected and engaged by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. Two internationally\nrecruited consultants will provide 19 person-months and three domestically recruited consultants\nwill provide 38 person-months. The consultants will provide expertise in agricultural project\nplanning and implementation, participatory planning methodology, policy research and advocacy,\ninstitutional and organizational aspects, and management information systems. Equipment and\nthe vehicle needed for TA implementation will be procured in a manner acceptable to the Bank.\nSome of the training seminars will be implemented with the assistance of suitable local resource\npersons and institutions, for example, the Institute of Local Government Academies (ILGA). The\nterms of reference are given in Appendix 3.\n23. The proposed TA will be implemented over a period of 15 months in three distinct\nphases: a Diagnostic Phase (two months), a Pilot Phase (12 months), and a Third Phase (one\nmonth) which will be used for evaluation of the Pilot Phase and for the formulation of a project\nproposal for implementation nationwide. This proposal will include scope, implementation\narrangements, and investment requirements.\n24. The consultant team will submit an inception report with a detailed draft work\nprogram one month after commencement of work, to be discussed at a tripartite meeting with\nthe Steering Committee and the Bank. At the end of each phase, a report will be submitted\ncovering the terms of reference for that phase, and to be discussed at a tripartite meeting with\nthe Steering Committee and the Bank. In addition, the consultants will make regular\npresentations to communicate findings and ideas to participants and clients to ensure an\ninteractive process.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n25. The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines in an amount\nnot exceeding the equivalent of $976,000 for Institutional Capacity Building for Policy\nFormulation, Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation for the Agriculture Sector.", "\t\n6\nAppendix 1\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF THE\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\nSECRETARY\nBureau of National\nAgricultural Statistics Food Authority\nComputer Quedan\nService Center Guarantee Corporation\nNational Agriculture National\nand Fishery Council Irrigation Administration\nNational Philippine\nNutrition Council Coconut Authority\nNational\t Sugar\nH\t\nLAgribusiness Corporat\t Regulatory Authority\nI\t Philippine Cotton 1\t 1\t National\nDevelopment\t Irngation Administration\nI\nI\t _____\nUndersecretary for Policy and Undersecretary for Fisheries,\nfor\t T\nPlanning, Finance and Livestock and Legislative!\nField Operations\nAdministrative Services Executive Uaison\nAssistant Secretary Assistant Secretary for Assistant Secretary\nfor Policy and Planning Regional Operations for\nLivestock Activities\nPlanning and - Regional Fields Units Livestock Group\nMonitoring Service - Regional Operations Group,\n\u2022 Bureau of Animal Industry,\n- Agricultural Information\n- Livestock Development Council,\nand Management Service,\n- National Meat Inspection\ninternational - Marketing Assistance Service, Commission,\nAgricultural - Special Concerns Office- - Philippine Carabao Center,\nAffairs Project Assistance Division - National Stud Farm,\n- Philippine Dairy Corporation\nAgricultural Credit\nAgribusiness Investment\nPolicy Council Fisheries Group\nand\ninformation Service\n- Bureau of Fisheries and\nAquatic Resources,\nFinance and Crops Group * Philippine Fisheries Development\nManagement Service Authority,\n- Bureau of Plant Industry, - Philippine Technical Administrative\n- Bureau of Soils and Water Committee\n- Southeast Asian Fisheries\nManagement,\nAdminstrative Service - Philippine Rice Research Development Center\ninstitute,\n- National Postharvest Institute\nfor Research and Extension,\n\u2022 Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority, LEGISLATIVE LIAISON OFFICE\n- Fiber Industry Develoopment\nAuthority\nResearch and Training Group\nBureau of Agricultural Research,\nAgricultural Training Institute\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 3)", "\t\n7\nAppendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'OOO)\nItem\t Foreign\t Local Total\nExchange\t Currency Cost\nA.

A multidisciplinary team composed of two international consultants and three\ndomestic consultants working in close collaboration with DA, DA attached agencies, DILG, and\nselected LGUs will carry out the TA. The TA is envisaged to be carried out over a period of 15\nmonths. It has three phases: Phase I is the diagnostic phase (two months); Phase II, the pilot\nimplementation phase (12 months); and Phase Ill, evaluation/formulation phase (one month).\n2. Phase I of the TA will be centered on diagnostic analyses and assessments of (i)\nthe organizational structure of DA, selected DA-related agencies and selected LGUs, staffing\npatterns and linkages among the agencies involved in policy formulation, sectoral planning,\nmonitoring, evaluation, and implementation of agricultural programs/projects; (ii) the capacity of\nPMS/PAD in the analysis and formulation of agricultural policies, advocacy capabilities to effect\npolicy reforms in agricultural trade, transport, fiscal, credit pricing policies, and other policies of\ndirect relevance to the agricultural sector; (iii) the capacity of DA-PMS and Regional Field Units\nfor participatory type of sectoral planning given the changes brought about by the LGC; (iv)\nDAJPMS capability to monitor and evaluate programs/projects effectively from central to the LGU\nlevels, and systems and procedures to enhance LGU-centered program/project implementation;\n(v) the systems and procedures in data collection and analysis and linkages with DA-related\nagencies such as the BAS, PMS, and Computer Services as well as LGUs involved in data\ngeneration, processing, analysis and interpretation, and storage and retrieval of data; (vi) role and\nfunction of PMS vis-a-vis BAS in data collection for monitoring and evaluation; and (vii) the\ngeneral capability and professional skills of DA staff in policy analysis, participatory planning,\nmonitoring, evaluation and implementation of programs/projects, and need for human resource\ndevelopment and training.\n3. The consultants will take stock of relevant project and donor experiences and also\nreview existing proposals for changes in DA which are relevant to their terms of reference. In\nparticular, the consultants will take into account the findings, conclusions, and recommendations\nof the Bank's RETA on Evaluation of Bank's Assistance to DMCs for Benefit Monitoring\nEvaluation. As part of the diagnostic/assessment process, a workshop will be organized during\nPhase I. At this workshop, the team of consultants will present their findings and\nrecommendations of Phase I to an audience of DA and relevant DA agencies, DILG, selected\nLGUs, and other stakeholders. This will include specific pilot activities, a human resources\ndevelopment and training program to be implemented under the TA in Phase II. It will also outline\nspecific institutional strengthening related to DA, Regional Field Units, and selected LGUs, some\nof which may be implemented during the second phase. This does not (necessarily) mean\nenlarging of the bureaucracy but rather modalities should be explored which led to a leaner but\nmore efficient bureaucracy.\n4. Phase Il will implement the proposals of Phase I, with specific field activities and\ntraining on a pilot basis. Subject to the findings of Phase I, three provinces (one in each major\nisland groupings of Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao) will be chosen as pilot areas for participatory\nsectoral planning, monitoring, evaluation, and implementation. The provinces will be selected on\nthe basis of their participation in the four banner programs (grains, livestock, commercial crops,\nfisheries) under the MTADP, their accessibility, and willingness of LGUs to collaborate with DA\nin this pilot phase. Subject to the findings in Phase I, recommendations that are likely to be\nimplemented in Phase II may include: (i) interim organizational improvements in DA-LGU\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 22)", "9\t Appendix 3, page 2\norganizational set ups that accommodate better participatory planning at the LGU levels\n(municipal, provincial levels); (ii) planning and implementation procedures that will result in more\neffective management decisions and implementation performance because of feedback and\ninputs from beneficiaries and other stakeholders in the planning process such as farmer\norganizations, women, NGOs, and the private sector; (iii) training activities, workshops, etc., that\nwill enhance the capacity of PMS/PAD staff to analyze, formulate, and advocate agricultural\npolicies, including strategies in promoting policy reforms; (iv) strengthening of institutional\nlinkages in the generation, processing and analysis of data, and monitoring and evaluation of\nprojects; and (v) development of a computerized management information system.\n5. Phase Ill will consolidate the findings from the pilot regional and provincial\nagricultural planning and training experiences, subject them to critical evaluation during\nworkshops, and finalize participatory planning, evaluation, monitoring and implementation\nmodalities which can be expanded in a nationwide program. A comprehensive proposal will be\nformulated to expand the pilot activities nationwide. The proposal will include a realistic\nimplementation schedule, cost estimates, human resource development, and training program,\nand manpower requirements.\n6. It will be important for the consultant to adopt a work methodology that ensures\nthat they work in a facilitating role within DA, and develop ownership and commitment in DA to\nany proposed changes. In case the required capacity to be trained/strengthened does not exist,\nalternative strategies may need to be explored the acquire the needed capabilities. As an\nalternative to traditional training programs, alternative methods may be to \"workshop\" what would\nbe provided in a training program, such as (i) review the objectives of the organizational unit, (ii)\nestablish critical success factors and identify performance indicators to report those factors, and\n(iii) review processes used to achieve the objectives. Regular presentations will be made to\ncommunicate findings and ideas to participants and clients to ensure an interactive process.\nB.\t International Consultants\n1.\t Agricultural Project Planning Specialist/Team Leader (15 person-months)\n7.
