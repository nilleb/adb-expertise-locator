INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to realize the vision of Asia \nand the Pacific being free of poverty. It focuses on three development agendas: (i) inclusive \neconomic  growth,  (ii)  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  (iii)  regional  integration.1 In \nsupport  of  these,  Strategy  2020  identifies  knowledge  solutions  and  the  promotion  of \npartnerships as major drivers of change. In response, the Technical Assistance Strategic Forum \n2008  highlighted  the  need  for  establishing  more  knowledge  partnerships  with  external \ncollaborators such as development institutions, research institutes, and private and civil society \norganizations. The priorities of the Economics and Research Department (ERD) for 2010\u22122012 \nalso identify the establishment of external research partnerships as a key initiative in improving \nERD\u2019s  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  These  partnerships  will  be  expanded  under  ERD\u2019s \nproposed strategic initiatives for 2012\u20132014. \n \n2.  In  April  2010,  the  ADB  President  approved  research  and  development  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Establishing  Global  Research  Alliances.2 The  TA  supported  research \npartnerships  with  the  National  School  of  Development  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nHarvard  University,  and  the  Center  for  Economic  Performance  of  the  London  School  of \nEconomics for studies relating to rebalancing and sustaining growth in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and human capital and economic development in Asia. Building on the success of these \npartnerships, the current TA aims to support alliances with reputable research organizations and \ndevelopment  institutions  through  the  conduct  of  more  collaborative  studies  on  selected \ndevelopment issues that are of critical importance to Asia and the Pacific. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  To  become  a knowledge  bank  in  the region, ADB  needs  to  play  a greater role  in \naddressing existing and emerging knowledge gaps in key development issues. In addition, with \ndeveloping Asia becoming increasingly integrated with the global economy and its economic \ninfluence continuing to grow, the need and demand for an Asian voice and perspectives on \nglobal issues are also rising. Moreover, many Asian issues, once considered solely regional, are \nnow recognized as global issues. As the only multilateral development bank based in Asia and \nthe Pacific, ADB has a crucial role to play in supporting the development of such voices and \nperspectives through rigorous and evidence-based research.  \n \n4.  The Technical Assistance Strategic Forum identified five priority areas for development \nand research TA during 2009\u22122011 in support of Strategy 2020: (i) promoting inclusive growth, \n(ii)  addressing  climate  change  for  sustainable  development,  (iii)  facilitating  knowledge  for \nregional integration, (iv) providing support to address increasing commodity prices, and (v) \nunderstanding demographic changes and implications for urban development. These issues will \ncontinue to be relevant for the region. As part of medium-term planning under its strategic \ndirections, 2012\u22122014, ERD identified six topics for its research program, in line with priority \nareas set by the Technical Assistance Strategic Forum: (i) inclusive growth; (ii) development of \nsouth\u2013south economic links;4 (iii) avoidance of the middle-income trap;5 (iv) the role of Asia in a \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

To implement the research program, ERD will actively seek to establish alliances with \nrespected research institutions and development partners within and outside of the region, \nbuilding on its past success. Such alliances will help ADB (i) pursue its objective of becoming a \nknowledge bank by establishing a wider research network, (ii) access a larger pool of talents \nand a broader range of expertise, (iii) enhance its capacity and improve efficiency in producing \nknowledge solutions and crafting policy options, (iv) disseminate knowledge solutions more \nwidely through its partners\u2019 networks and, ultimately, (v) raise the profile of ADB as a knowledge \ninstitution. \n \n6.  The TA will finance four collaborative studies in line with the broad thrusts of ERD\u2019s \n2012\u22122014 research program. The first collaborative study will be on the issue of food security, \nwhich  falls  squarely  under  the  research  area  of  building  resilient  Asian  economies.  Food \nsecurity is critical to the region\u2019s ability to ensure sustainable poverty reduction and inclusive \neconomic growth. Population and consumption dynamics are expected to continue to increase \nglobal  demand  for  food  over  the  next  several  decades.  Coupled  with  continued  global \ncommodity price volatility, these dynamics are creating converging pressures and challenges. \nSimilarly,  rising food  production  will  increase  pressure  on  ecosystems  and  competition for \nscarce freshwater resources. The region will also be affected by global climate change impacts \nsuch as changing precipitation patterns and increased flooding. Higher food prices can erode \nthe purchasing power of households and undermine recent gains from poverty reduction. Higher \nfood prices will mean that very poor people will eat less or lower quality food, thus exacerbating \nthe already serious concern for undernourishment of a large part of the region\u2019s population. \nDeterioration in the health status of the poor will further restrict their ability to gain employment \nand income, thus driving them deeper into poverty. \n \n7.  The food security study will be undertaken in partnership with the Canadian International \nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA)  and  the  University  of  British  Columbia  (UBC).  Discussions \nbetween ADB, CIDA, and UBC are at an advanced stage. For the other three studies, ERD is \nexploring possible partnerships with regional development banks, development agencies of the \nUnited Nations system, bilateral development agencies, and think thanks and research institutes. \nLessons  from  the  Establishing  Global  Research  Alliances  TA  on  the  nature  of  research \npartnerships are incorporated in the design of the TA implementation arrangements. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be more effective policy development and policy making in \ndeveloping Asia toward sustainable and inclusive growth. \n \n9.  The outcome of the TA will be improved understanding of key development challenges \nfaced  by  developing  Asia  through  the  implementation  of  four  collaborative  studies,  each \nfocusing on one of the following broad areas: (i) inclusive growth, its measurement, and public \npolicy;  \n                                                                                                                                                       \n5 Many  countries,  after  entering  the  middle-income  stage,  experience  significant  growth  slowdown  and  find \nthemselves getting caught in what is increasingly known as the \u2015middle-income trap.\u2016  \n ", "  3 \n(ii) south\u2013south economic links covering trade, investment, and/or knowledge exchange; (iii) the \nmiddle-income trap, its causes, and policy implications; (iv) the role of Asia in a globalized \neconomy, covering trade, investment, and/or economic governance; (v) development of resilient \nAsian  economies,  including  food  security,  resources  constraints,  and  green  growth;  and  \n(vi) governance in Asia and the Pacific. The outline of the expected report from the study on \nfood  security  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  outlines  of  the  other  studies  will  be  developed  in \ncollaboration with research partners during TA implementation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will finance four collaborative studies with external partners. Each study will \ninvolve (i) the production of research papers, reports, policy briefs, opinion pieces, and books;  \n(ii)  conferences,  seminars,  workshops,  and  multimedia  events  to  discuss  and  disseminate \nresearch findings; and (iii) roundtable discussions on research findings with officials and policy \nmakers from the developing member countries (DMCs). \n \n11.  The purpose of the research study on food security is to increase understanding of, \nsynthesize, and articulate key policy challenges and opportunities related to food security in the \nregion, as well as to contextualize the role and importance of the region in the global context. \nThe study will provide detailed analyses and evidence-based policy recommendations. It will \ncover challenges and opportunities posed by the dynamics in global, regional, and national food \nmarkets.  The  study  approach  will  be  multidisciplinary\u2014focusing  on  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental aspects of food security. On social aspects, the study will look at the impacts of \nfood security from the perspective of how different groups are affected, such as by income, \ngender,  and  country.  The  other  three  studies  will  follow  a  similar  approach,  taking  into \nconsideration the nature of the study subjects. \n \n12.  Risk and assumptions. The key potential risk is that concerned government agencies \nin the DMCs may not be fully aware of the study findings and as a result their medium-to-long-\nterm strategies will not benefit from the research findings. To mitigate this risk, ERD will work \nwith key agencies in selected DMCs, through regional departments, in the design and conduct \nof  background  studies,  to  ensure  strong  country  ownership.  Another  potential  risk  is  the \nemergence of a global or regional crisis that will shift the focus of development efforts in the \nDMCs away from medium- to long-term priorities to short-term initiatives aimed at tackling the \ncrisis. Another risk involves the underutilization of funds or delays in closing the TA if ADB and \npotential partners cannot agree on, or encounter delays in agreeing to, common terms in the \nidentification of study areas and division of labor for the other studies. To mitigate this risk, ERD \nwill  continue  to  be  proactive  in  firming  up  partnerships.  The  key  assumptions  include  the \nwillingness of policy makers to base medium- to long-term policies on systematic and quality \neconomic  analysis,  the  availability  of  high-quality  datasets  in  selected  DMCs,  and  the \nagreement of research partners on the terms of collaboration. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA, estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent, will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  TA  is  expected  to  finance  four \ncollaborative studies, with an allocation of about $250,000 each. Actual utilization by each study \nmay vary depending on the availability of useful secondary data, complexity of the issues to be \naddressed by the studies, and required technical expertise. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be managed by the Office of the \nChief Economist in ERD. The studies will be implemented by designated ERD staff, in close \nconsultation with other ADB departments, such as the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment,  Strategy  and  Policy  Department,  and  regional  departments;  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank Institute, as necessary, to ensure that the upcoming studies are policy \nrelevant  and  to  avoid  duplications  within  ADB.  A  steering  committee  comprising  the  ERD \nmanagement team will provide strategic oversight, including on the selection of research topics. \nThe steering committee will meet as often as necessary to ensure smooth and timely  TA \nimplementation. \n \n15.  The food security study will be undertaken in collaboration with CIDA and UBC in a \nmanner similar to parallel cofinancing, i.e., work and responsibilities are divided among the \npartners, which will control and allocate their own resources. The TA will finance 11 of the  \n16 background papers for the study. A synthesis report will be prepared jointly by ADB, CIDA, \nand UBC. Two workshops will be organized under the study, one by ADB and the other by CIDA, \nwith each partner financing the participation of their respective consultants or resource persons \nin the workshops. The TA will finance all costs associated with the study\u2019s publication and \nADB\u2019s own dissemination activities.  \n \n16.  For the other three studies, a similar approach will be followed if the partner is a regional \ndevelopment bank or development agency. When the partner is a research institute or think \ntank, either the partner will be engaged as a consulting firm, or its research staff members will \nbe engaged as individual consultants. For the four studies, the TA will require a total of about  \n44 person-months of international and 23 person-months of national consulting services, either \nas individual consultants or through consulting firms. Individual consultants, resource people, \nand/or partner research institutes will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Appendix 4 provides the outline \nterms of reference for individual consultants and partner research institutions. These terms of \nreference will be developed further depending on the selected research topics and terms of \ncollaboration with the research partners. During implementation, ERD will seek guidance on the \nappropriate selection procedure from the Central Operations Services Office, on a case-by-case \nbasis.  \n \n17.  Disbursements  under  this  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n18.  The TA will begin on 1 December 2011 and be completed by 31 March 2014. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Establishing Global Research Alliances (Phase 2), and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nMore effective policy  Incorporation of research  Medium-term  DMC policy makers are \ndevelopment and  findings in the medium- to  development strategies  willing to base medium- \npolicy making in  long-term development  in selected DMCs, policy  to long-term policies on \ndeveloping Asia and  plans of selected DMCs  pronouncements and  economic \nin selected  legislation, and media  considerations. \ndeveloping member  reports   \ncountries (DMCs)   \nRisks \n  TA completion report \nOccurrence of global or \n(TCR) \nregional crises may \n    divert the policy focus \naway from medium- or \nlong-term priorities. \n \nPlanning agencies and \npolicy makers in \nselected DMCs may not \nbe able to translate the \nresearch findings into \nworkable policy options \ndue to lack of \nawareness of the \nresearch findings. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved  Planning agencies in  Government plans and  Research findings are \nunderstanding of the  selected DMCs take steps  reports  widely disseminated \ndevelopment  to translate research    among key \nchallenges faced by  findings into workable  stakeholders in \ndeveloping Asia and  plans and programs  participating DMCs. \nthe need for related   \n  TCR \nreforms \n \n     \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
