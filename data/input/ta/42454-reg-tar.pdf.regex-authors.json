Weak governance and corruption deter investment, waste and distort the allocation of \nresources, undermine the credibility of public authorities and increase insecurity. The second \nGovernance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II) for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nis  aimed  at  improving  ADB\u2019s  performance  in  implementing  governance  and  anticorruption \npolicies in sectors where ADB is active and designing and delivering better quality projects and \nprograms.1 The goal of the Pacific Plan  is to enhance good governance, economic growth, \nsustainable development and security through regionalism.2 In December 2006, ADB approved \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Governance and Accountability in Pacific Island \nCountries,3 which has successfully supported the initial implementation of GACAP II in the \nPacific region, and assisted in the design of the Pacific Regional Audit Initiative (PRAI)\u2014a \nPacific Plan initiative. After an extensive consultation process, the April 2008 congress of the 25-\nmember Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI) endorsed the PRAI design; \nthe initiative was also endorsed by Pacific island leaders at the August 2008 meeting of the \nPacific Islands Forum (PIF). \n \n2.  This TA will support the initial implementation of PRAI and the further implementation of \nGACAP II in the Pacific region. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific strategy 2005\u20132009,4 \nwhich identifies strengthened government transparency and accountability as a key result area. \nThe  TA  was  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  regional  operations  business  plan  for  2007\u20132010.5 \nMoreover, in supporting the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,6 recipient countries \nhave committed to publishing timely, transparent, and reliable (audited) financial reports, while \ndevelopment  partners  (including  ADB)  have  committed  to  relying  to  the  maximum  extent \npossible  on  country  public  financial  management  systems.7 The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.8 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Public  auditing  in  the  Pacific  region  overall  has  advanced  substantially  in  the  past \ndecade\u2014numerous  audit  backlogs  have  been  cleared  and  audit  quality  has  improved \nsignificantly.  The  performance  of  almost  all  Pacific  supreme  audit  institutions  (SAIs)  has \nimproved. These gains have been made in the face of intimidating challenges. Sustaining such \ngains  is  difficult  in  smaller  country  settings\u2014auditing  in  tight-knit  social  and  cultural \nenvironments  involves  significant  political,  professional  and  personal  pressures.  Moreover, \nPacific SAIs are at differing development stages and, for some, much more remains to be done \nto reach uniformly high standards.  \n \n4.  Building the capacity of Pacific SAIs is fundamental to improving regional governance. \nHowever to be effective, the head of an SAI must (i) be independent of the legislature and the \nexecutive, (ii) audit all entities within the audit portfolio, (iii) issue timely audit opinions and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Paris. \n7  Signatories of the Paris declaration include Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Timor-Leste, Tonga and Vanuatu. \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 September 2008. \n ", "2   \nreports, (iv) manage the SAI effectively with well-qualified staff, and (iv) minimize the cost and \nmaximize the benefits of the SAI\u2019s operations. In October 2005, PIF leaders, in consideration of \nsubstantial benefits accruing from regional cooperation,9 endorsed for further study and analysis \nPacific Plan initiative 12.1, which includes the PRAI. \n \n5.  Regionalism is not new to Pacific public auditors\u23afthey are represented by PASAI,10 \nwhich is a regional working group of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions \n(INTOSAI).11 The PRAI design was developed through a 2-year consultation process under \nPASAI\u2019s guidance, supported by TA for Strengthening Governance and Accountability in Pacific \nIsland Countries (footnote 2) undertaken by ADB (Japan Special Fund) and the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID) with oversight by the PIF Secretariat.  \n \n6.  ADB has provided five TA grants to PASAI since 1989, some of which were supported \njointly by the INTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI).12 A 2002 review of efforts to strengthen \nPacific audit capability concluded that intended benefits were achieved but much more remained \nto be done.13 Lessons included the need to thoroughly diagnose requirements, address legal \nindependence and mandate issues, and address accounts-preparation issues. \n \n7.  The April 2008 PASAI congress in Rarotonga unanimously confirmed the PRAI design. \nThe PRAI\u2019s overarching objective is to raise Pacific public auditing to uniformly high standards, \nwhich is expected to improve transparency and accountability in managing and using public \nresources, and will enable timely auditing of public accounts in participating countries to a high \nstandard. The PRAI will also enhance the impact of audit findings and assist with performance \naudits, including environmental audits. Furthermore, it is intended that by the end of 2012, 80% \nof participating SAIs will be at level three or higher on the PASAI capability model.14 If funding \ncan be secured, during the initial program period (2008\u20132012) PRAI will (i) assist regional \ncooperation and coordination, mainly by establishing the enhanced PASAI secretariat; (ii) build \nand sustain public auditing capacity; (iii) conduct cooperative financial and performance audits; \nand (iv) develop communication and advocate transparency and accountability. \n \n8.  PASAI agreed that the strengthened PASAI secretariat will be based initially in Suva, Fiji \nIslands,  and  stipulated  the  following  PRAI  guiding  principles:  (i)  SAI  autonomy  and \nindependence must be preserved; (ii) a regional approach is appropriate for addressing common \n                                                 \n9  ADB and Commonwealth Secretariat. 2005.

Working paper \nfor Toward a New Pacific Regionalism. Manila: ADB. \n10  Founded in 1987, PASAI\u2019s primary objectives include promoting understanding and cooperation among member \ninstitutions; providing facilities for training and continuing education for government auditors, with a view to \nimproving  the  quality  of  their  performance;  serving  as  a  center  of  information  and  as  a  regional  link  with \norganizations and institutions in other parts of the world; promoting closer collaboration and brotherhood among \nauditors in the government service among regional groups; assisting each other by providing TA; and exchanging \nexpertise that will benefit members. PASAI has 25 members, excluding Niue and Tokelau (Appendix 2). \n11  INTOSAI, established in 1953, is the professional organization of SAIs in countries that belong to the United \nNations or its specialized agencies. \n12  IDI was established in 1986 as INTOSAI\u2019s training arm. Its mission is to help SAIs, especially in developing \ncountries, to improve their audit capacity and resolve audit issues through training and information sharing. \n13  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance Performance Audit Report on Strengthening Audit Capability in the Pacific. Manila \n(October). \n14  Developed during phase 1, the PASAI capability model considers the status of five capability attributes (audit types, \naudit management, office management, human resource management, and information and communications \ntechnology). Each attribute is rated on a 6-point scale (0\u20135). Summary rankings are as follows: 5 = the SAI is \ncontributing proactively to the public sector and to its peers; 4 = the SAI is confident; 3 = the SAI is functional; 2 = \nthe SAI is operating safely; 1 = the SAI is established; and 0 = the SAI is not established or is struggling.  \n ", "  3\nissues, but PASAI members will continue to have individual needs; (iii) the PRAI should apply to \nall  PASAI  members,  not  just  to  PIF  members;  and  (iv)  PASAI  supports  the  continued \ninvolvement of private sector auditors where appropriate (private sector resources should be \nused appropriately, but under the auspices of SAI heads). \n \n9.  The  PRAI  is  inextricably  linked  to  other  complementary  activities,  including  national \nefforts to strengthen financial accounting and reporting, and efforts to improve scrutiny and \naccountability, such as the Pacific Regional Ombudsmen Initiative, supported by AusAID, and \nthe  Governance  in  the  Pacific  project,  supported  by  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme.  The  initial  PRAI  emphasis,  for  2008\u20132009,  will  be  on  (i)  establishing  the \nstrengthened PASAI secretariat, which will be based in Suva, Fiji Islands, and identifying long-\nterm, sustainable, funding options and sources; (ii) establishing the subregional audit support \nprogram  for  Kiribati,  Nauru  and  Tuvalu;  (iii)  designing  the  long-term  structured  capacity \ndevelopment program; and (iv) initiating the first cooperative performance audit, which may have \nan environmental focus. \n \n10.  GACAP II\u2019s design benefited from a rigorous review of ADB\u2019s first governance action \nplan.15 Key result areas include (i) improving the identification and management of governance, \ninstitutional, and corruption risks in country partnership strategies (CPSs) and during country \nportfolio review missions; (ii) strengthening governance and anticorruption components in project \nand  project  design;  (iii)  strengthening  program  and  project  administration  and  portfolio \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  improving  organizational  structure, human  resources,  and access  to \nexpertise. \n \n11.  In keeping with GACAP II objectives, Strengthening Governance and Accountability in \nPacific  Island  Countries  supported  the  preparation  of  several  governance  assessments  for \nPacific island countries, including the first CPS risk-based governance assessment in the Pacific \nregion for Samoa in 2007. It is supporting the preparation of further governance assessments \nduring 2008, including full risk-based assessments for the Federated States of Micronesia and \nPalau.  It  also  supported  the  preparation  of  program  and  project-level  governance  risk \nassessment and management plans (GRAMPs), which focus on specific thematic issues\u2014public \nfinancial management (PFM), procurement and anti-corruption\u2014for the Samoa SchoolNet and \nCommunity Access Project16 and for the proposed Papua New Guinea Highlands Region Road \nImprovement Program. The experience gained from the SchoolNet GRAMP contributed to the \ndevelopment of the GACAP II implementation guidelines.17 These efforts are improving the \nquality of CPSs and project designs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The proposed regional TA is intended to promote good governance through improved \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency  in  managing  and  using  public  resources  in  the \nPacific.18 Specifically, the TA is intended to support the initial implementation of the PRAI, which \nwill provide a basis for raising public auditing to uniformly high standards across the Pacific \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2005.

Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Pacific  Regional  Audit  Initiative  Component.  The  TA  will  support  initial  PRAI \nimplementation activities. Expected outputs comprise: \n \n(i)  Strengthened  regional  cooperation  and  coordination.  Support  for  the  PASAI \nTransitional Working Group (TWG) will guide and support the establishment and initial \noperations of the strengthened PASAI secretariat in Suva, Fiji Islands and the initial \nimplementation of PRAI. 19 Activities will include analyzing legal and institutional issues \nregarding the PASAI secretariat, designing institutional structures and positions, and \nengaging PASAI secretariat staff. Options for longer-term PASAI funding will be also \nidentified in consultation with potential funders. The TWG met in September 2008 and \nwill meet again in March 2009. Palau will host the XIIth PASAI Congress in mid-2009, \nwhich will consider the TWG\u2019s recommendations.20 \n \n(ii)  Design for a capacity development program. This will include developing generic \ncompetencies and job descriptions on the basis of which a structured 3-year capacity \ndevelopment program will be developed. The capacity development program will include \ncosted and sequenced activities for consideration by PASAI and potential funders. \n \n(iii)  Cooperative financial and performance audits initiated. This will include establishing \nthe subregional audit support (SAS) program for Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu, which will \ninvolve updating the SAS program design, agreeing on SAS program implementation \nplans, and establishing and mobilizing the SAS team to conduct the first round of SAS \nfinancial  audits.  The  SAS  team  will  comprise  consultants  and  secondees  from \nparticipating countries. The TA will support SAS program meetings in November 2008 \nand in March 2009 (to coincide with the TWG meeting). This output will also include \nsupporting the TWG to identify and prioritize cooperative performance audit topics, to \ndevelop a design for the proposed cooperative audit, and to present the program and the \ndesign to the XIIth PASAI Congress for consideration, endorsement and implementation. \n \n(iv)  First Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions annual report prepared and \nreleased. The report will be focus on regional accountability and transparency issues, \nincluding SAI independence, audit-finding follow-up and other issues of concern to SAIs. \n \n14.  Governance Component. Assessing public financial management, procurement, and \ncorruption risks is an important starting point for formulating ADB developing member country \ndevelopment plans and CPSs. Drawing on assessment methodologies and tools that ADB has \ndeveloped,  and  with  civil  society  input,  this  component  will  support  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  in  the  Pacific  region  of  governance,  institutional,  and  corruption  risk \nassessments and risk management plans at the country, sector, and program and/or project \nlevels. \n                                                 \n19  The Office of the Controller and Auditor General of New Zealand currently performs the PASAI secretariat function \non a voluntary basis. TWG membership comprises Cook Islands (chair), Fiji Islands, New Zealand, Palau, Papua \nNew Guinea, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Samoa and an ADB representative. \n20  The IDI supported the September 2008 meeting. The TA will support the other meetings. \n ", "  5\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $2,400,000 equivalent. A portion of the TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia21 and administered by ADB. The \nbalance ($1,500,000) will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The remainder of the cost ($500,000) will be contributed through in-kind \ncontributions from participating governments (Appendix 3).22 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency (EA) for the governance component and the PASAI \nTWG will be the EA for the PRAI component. \n \n17.  The PRAI component will require international consultants (estimated 36 person-months \nof inputs) with skills and expertise in strategic planning and institutional establishment, public \nauditing, performance auditing, legal and capacity building; and national consultants (estimated \n18 person-months of inputs) with skills and expertise in public auditing and related disciplines. \nThe governance component will require international consultants (6 person-months of inputs) \nwith governance, financial management, procurement, and anticorruption skills. It is desirable \nthat  consultants  have  demonstrated  previous  successful  experience  working  in  the  Pacific \nislands on regional projects, ideally in both US- and non-US-affiliated countries. Appendix 4 \ndetails deliverables and reporting requirements. \n \n18.  All consultants will be engaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 4. Equipment will be procured for the SAS program and the \nPASAI  secretariat  (computers,  printers  and  furniture)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2008,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nequipment  will  be  transferred  to  the  strengthened  PASAI  secretariat.  TA  activities  will  be \nimplemented over a 24-month period starting in November 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis, for Strengthening Governance and \nAccountability in Pacific Island Countries (Phase 2), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n21     Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank. \n22   Most in-kind costs will be associated with the remuneration of officials seconded to the SAS team. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets/  Data Sources/ Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions  \nImproved  Average one-step improvement  Country PEFA public  Participating jurisdictions \ntransparency and  of relevant public expenditure and financial management  remain committed to \naccountability in  financial accountability (PEFA)  (PFM) assessments.  improving transparency \nmanaging and using  performance indicators by end- Pacific Regional Audit  and accountability. \npublic resources in  2012.a  Initiative (PRAI) status \nPFM systems continue to \nPacific island  Country partnership strategies  reports.  improve. \ncountries. \n(CPSs) and project designs  Second Governance and \nincorporate governance risk  Anticorruption Action Plan \nassessments and management  (GACAP II) implementation \nplans.  reports. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nThe public accounts of  By the end of 2012 PEFA PI-26  PASAI secretariat  Continued strong \nparticipating countries  indicator reaches an average  stocktake of audited public  commitment from \nare audited in a timely  rating of B  accounts.  participating jurisdictions \nmanner to uniformly  to effective public \nBy end the of 2012 80% of  PEFA PFM assessments. \nhigh standards, with  auditing. \nparticipating SAIs are at level \nenhanced audit  PRAI status reports. \nthree or higher on the Pacific  PASAI identifies and \nimpacts and improved \nAssociation of Supreme Audit  GACAP II implementation  secures long-term, \naudit capability. \nInstitutions (PASAI) capability  reports.  sustainable funding. \nStrengthened  model.  \ngovernance and    Risk \nanticorruption  CPSs and projects incorporate  Financial reports and \norientation of CPSs  governance risk assessments  records are not available \nand ADB projects.  and management plans.  for audit in a timely \nmanner. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
