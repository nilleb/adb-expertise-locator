INTRODUCTION \n1.  This  regional  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  allow  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and its developing member countries (DMCs) to effectively participate \nat the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF-4) to be held in the Republic of \nKorea in 2011 and in preparatory activities leading to the event.1 The TA also represents ADB\u2019s \nongoing commitment to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (the Paris Declaration), as \nexpressed by the President at the Second High-Level Forum (HLF-2) in Paris in March 2005 \nand subsequently reaffirmed at the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF-3) in \nAccra, Ghana in September 2008. The concept note on this subject was approved on 28 \nSeptember 2009. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Commitment to support global efforts to enhance aid effectiveness. ADB, as a part \nof the development community, participated in the HLF-1 held in Rome in 2003, which identified \na general framework for harmonization and alignment; the HLF-2, which produced the Paris \nDeclaration; and the HLF-3, which endorsed the Accra Agenda for Action. ADB organized and \nparticipated  in  a  number  of  key  events  notably  the  regional  consultation  workshops  in \npreparation for the HLF-2 and HLF-3, the post-Paris consultations and monitoring surveys, and \nthe managing for development results (MfDR) round tables and related activities. As a follow-up \nto the HLF-3, ADB facilitated DMC capacity development through peer-to-peer learning as part \nof the Capacity Development for Development Effectiveness (CDDE) Facility program.2  \n \n3.  Focus on improving aid effectiveness in the region. ADB is currently finalizing the \nresults of its third aid effectiveness survey covering aid disbursed to 25 countries in the Asia \nand Pacific region in 2008. While ADB has made significant progress in meeting its Paris \nDeclaration commitments and in the three Accra Agenda for Action focus areas, much more is \nrequired  to  improve  aid  effectiveness  and  development  effectiveness  in  the  region.  This \nrequires international, ADB-wide, and country actions. It will also require continued efforts in \npursuing current initiatives including enhancing capacity development; strengthening country \nownership; mainstreaming the principles of aid effectiveness in ADB policies, strategies, and \noperating guidelines; and building more effective and inclusive international partnerships to \ninfluence global policy and actions on key issues. \n \n4.  Greater role for ADB in HLF-4. ADB played a key role in the HLF-3. Since the HLF-4 is \nto be held in Asia and the Pacific and be hosted by an important partner\u2014the Republic of \nKorea\u2014ADB is expected to play an even more active role in organizing and supporting the \nevent as well as the preparatory activities. The Working Party on Aid Effectiveness (WP-EFF) of \nthe Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD-DAC) is beginning to prepare for the HLF-4. The HLF-4 and the analysis \nthat  feeds  into  it  will  assess  how  countries  and  development  partners  have  performed  in \ndelivering  on  their  commitments.  The  concept  note  and  draft  agenda  are  currently  being \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 23 October 2009. \n2  To support DMC capacity development needs for in-country implementation of the Paris Declaration, a joint \ndevelopment partner initiative\u2014the CDDE Facility\u2014was launched in Manila in March 2009 with support from the \nGovernment of Japan, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Regional Center Bangkok, and World \nBank. ADB 2009. Technical Assistance for the Governance and Capacity Development Initiative (Phase 2). Manila \n(TA 7277-REG) provided $150,000 to the joint development partners' fund managed by UNDP, Regional Center \nBangkok.  http://www.adb.org/Aid-Effectiveness/default.asp  and  http://www.aideffectiveness.org/CDDE-Capacity-\nDevelopment-for-Development-Effectiveness-Facility.html   ", "2     \n \nfinalized  by  the  HLF-4  organizing  committee  in  consultation  with  development  partners.  A \ndiscussion of the preparatory works follows. \n \n5.  Promote  south-south  cooperation  to  enhance  cooperation  effectiveness  and \nachieve development results. As a member of the task team on south-south cooperation \n(SSC), ADB is expected to play a significant role in the High-Level Event (HLE) on South-South \nCooperation  and  Capacity  Development  to  be  held  in  March  2010  in  Colombia.  After \ndocumenting and analyzing SSC experiences and their synergies with the aid effectiveness \nagenda, the task team intends to identify and agree on good SSC practices. This analytical work \nwill be disseminated and discussed at the HLE in the context of aid effectiveness. \n \n6.  As a member of the steering committee, ADB is expected to, among others, (i) support, \nfollow up, and supervise thematic preparation for the HLE on SSC, particularly regarding the \nwork of round tables and corresponding analytical work; (ii) promote and ensure synergies and \nbalances  between  the  SSC  and  capacity  development  agendas,  (iii)  prepare,  share,  and \nconsolidate the ministerial and heads of delegation recommendations for the HLE regarding \nSSC and capacity development; and (iv) safeguard the integration of the HLE in the broader \nlogic of the process leading from Accra 2008 via the HLE in 2010 and HLF-4 in 2011. ADB will \nalso facilitate participation of some DMCs in the Asia regional meeting. \n \n7.  Strengthen capacity development of DMCs. ADB will help strengthen the voice of \npartner countries through the south\u2013south initiatives financed by the CDDE Facility. The facility \nmade significant progress in building DMC capacity, and facilitating implementation of the Paris \nDeclaration in the region.3 The continued support to the CDDE Facility through this TA is \nnecessary  to  provide  assistance  to  the  DMCs  on  issues  related  to  aid  effectiveness,  and \nstrengthen input from Asia and the Pacific for the HLF-4. The CDDE work plan for 2010 and \n2011 is being prepared using consultations with the Asia-Pacific community of practice on aid \neffectiveness, set up by the CDDE Facility. All facility south-south initiatives have capacity \ndevelopment at their core and a concern with monitoring country results. \n \n8.  Improve the use of conditionality that reinforces country ownership. ADB co-chairs \na task team on conditionality under the transparent and responsible aid cluster of the WP-EFF. \nADB will undertake joint analytical work, participate in country consultations, and disseminate \ngood practices on conditionality with other members of the task team. The outcomes of this \nwork will also feed into the HLF-4.  \n \n9.  Support DMC participation at the HLF-4. ADB will support DMC participation in the \nHLF-4 as well as in the preparatory meetings. Through subregional consultations, ADB will draw \non the views of its partner countries and civil society organizations to assess the impact of the \nParis  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness  across  the  region,  and  facilitate  development  of \nperspectives and priorities on aid effectiveness for Asia and the Pacific. \n \n10.  This TA is therefore required to ensure effective participation of the DMCs and ADB in \nthe HLF-4 and in the preparatory activities; and through such participation to enhance country \nownership and leadership, and influence global policy on aid effectiveness.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Details are provided in the Six-Month Progress Report of the CDDE Facility at www.aideffectiveness.org. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA will contribute to global efforts to improve international aid effectiveness policies \nand development partner approaches that are aligned to DMC needs in the region. The TA's \noutcome will be enhanced country ownership and leadership of the aid effectiveness agenda. \n \n12.  The  expected  outputs  are  (i)  best  practices  and  country-specific  examples  to  be \npresented at the HLE on SSC and the HLF-4; (ii) a regional perspective document and regional \nconsultation reports on key HLF-4 themes; (iii) report on shared experiences and common \nissues with MfDR to be presented at the HLF-4; (iv) CDDE Facility outputs, such as initiatives \nreports and annual progress reports based on the work plan for 2010 and 2011; and (v) \ndocumented best practices of development partners on conditionality. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Activities for the 2010 HLE on SSC and capacity development and the 2011 HLF-4 \ninclude \n \n(i)  support for the participation of DMCs in (a) the January 2010 regional meeting in \nAsia, including financing of travel and accommodation costs, and preparation of \ncase studies; (b) the OECD-DAC 2010 survey (organization of regional workshop \nand country support through resident missions); and (c) the 2011 HLF-4 (both \nfrom government and civil society organizations) including financing of travel and \naccommodation costs, and preparation and participation at the marketplace);  \n \n(ii)  organization of the consultation process within Asia and the Pacific in 2010 and \n2011 (holding of several subregional workshops and publication of reports); \n \n(iii)  ADB's  own  contribution  and  participation  at  the  HLE  and  HLF-4  (including \npreparation  of  case  studies,  staff  contribution  for  round  tables  and  plenary \nsessions,  organization  of  side  events,  participation  at  the  marketplace, \npreparation of ADB survey reports);  \n \n(iv)  dissemination  of  packages  and  reports  to  improve  awareness  of  the  HLF-4 \nprocess within and outside of ADB; and \n \n(v)  financing of DMC-led follow-up subregional and country activities (2010\u20132011). \n14.  ADB is part of the CDDE Facility secretariat and the steering committee, and will be \nclosely involved in preparing the CDDE work plan for 2010 and 2011. The United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) Regional Center Bangkok will administer the CDDE activities \nand manage resources based on the agreed work plan.  \n \n15.  ADB, as a co-chair of the task team on conditionality, will contribute documentation of \ngood practice, and country dissemination of such practices. The outcomes of this work will feed \ninto the HLF-4.   \n \n   ", "4     \n \n16.  ADB will organize a regional meeting of the community of practice of MfDR members at \na location and date to be determined to share experiences and ideas about the use of MfDR for \nachieving development outcomes, and identify common issues to be presented at the HLF-4. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The  TA  is estimated  to  cost  $700,000,  to  be  financed on  a  grant  basis  by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). This amount includes (i) consulting services; and \n(ii)  training,  seminars,  and  conferences  (for  the  consultation  meetings  including  travel  of \nresource persons and DMC participants). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  A steering group will be set up to provide guidance on major decisions on various \naspects of HLF-4 activities, agree on ADB's position from an institutional perspective, and \nsystematically facilitate early decisions on major activities. The steering group will be headed by \nthe director general of ADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy Department (SPD) and comprise senior staff \n(depending on the specific agenda of the HLE and HLF-4, which is being prepared by the WP-\nEFF, of which ADB is a member). An interdepartment working group will be set up to coordinate \nelements of aid effectiveness covering issues of public financial management, procurement, and \nresults; and to develop a coordinated work plan to prepare for the HLF-4 and preparatory \nactivities. The working group will be led by the Strategy, Planning, Policy and Interagency \nRelations Division.   \n \n19.  SPD will implement the TA from December 2009 to May 2012. ADB will be the executing \nagency. SPD, specifically the Strategy, Planning, Policy and Interagency Relations Division, will \nadminister the TA in cooperation with the regional departments, resident missions, and other \nstaff depending on the topics for the 2010 HLE and 2011 HLF. CDDE activities will be managed \nand implemented by the UNDP Regional Center in Bangkok. Through this TA, ADB will provide \n$150,000 to the joint development partners' fund that UNDP will manage. For this purpose, an \nadministrative  arrangement  between  ADB  and  UNDP  will  be  signed  as  set  out  in  the \nmemorandum of understanding between them dated 23 July 2007. Consultants will be engaged \nto provide technical support and administrative and logistical assistance (for organization of \nworkshops,  seminars,  and  other  activities).  Estimated  inputs  of  7  person-months  from \ninternational consultants and 12 person-months from national consultants will be required. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will engage the consultants on \nan individual basis and in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). A no-objection letter will be obtained from each DMC where DMC-\nspecific activities will be conducted. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance \nwith ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.4  \n \n20.  SPD will work with the regional departments to organize the workshops and prepare the \nnecessary materials for the consultations.  \n \n21.  To  ensure  timely  and  effective  dissemination  of  results  and  deliverables  from  the \nconsultation  workshops,  plans  are  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  consolidated  report  and \nsummaries  of  discussions  at  the  workshops  will  be  disseminated  to  the  DMCs  and  other \ndevelopment institutions. These reports will also be distributed at the HLF-4. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "  5\n \nIV.
