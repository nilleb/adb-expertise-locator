At the request of the Government of Bhutan, the Fact-Finding Mission from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) visited Bhutan during 9-15 August 2002 to formulate an advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) for housing sector  reform.1 The Mission held discussions with the \nresponsible officials of concerned agencies, including the Ministry of Finance, Department of Aid \nand Debt Management (DADM), Ministry of Communications (MOC), the Planning Commission, \nthe city corporations of Thimphu and Phuentsholing, and key stakeholders in the Bhutanese \nhousing and finance sectors. This TA was developed on the basis of understanding reached \nduring the Mission. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bhutan is a landlocked country in the Eastern Himalayas, covering approximately 30,400 \nsquare kilometers of mostly mountainous terrain. Prior to the early 1960s, Bhutan was isolated \nfrom the rest of the world and its overwhelming rural population was entirely dependent on \nsubsistence agriculture. With the quickening pace of development in the last 15-20 years, \nhowever, Bhutan is already experiencing signs of urban growth pressures. While the population \nin 2000 was estimated at 658,000 with a population growth rate of 2.5%, the rural-urban \nmigration is estimated at 10% per year. Even though Bhutan\u2019s urban centers are still small by \ninternational standards, its urban problems are not less significant or simpler to address.  \n \n3.  Bhutan suffers from a serious housing shortage, particularly in the urban areas where \nhousing programs are still dominated by public sector social rental housing. Rapid population \ngrowth in urban centers, lack of easy access to land, and a shortage of funds for public housing \nprograms are mainly responsible for the increasing housing problem. It is estimated that in \nThimphu2 alone, 600 new dwellings a year would need to be built just to keep up with population \ngrowth, but without absorbing the current deficit. Moreover the age and quality of the existing \nhousing  stock  call  for  substantial  investments  in  renovation.  The  housing  sector  has  not \nresponded well by either contributing to economic growth or meeting social shelter objectives. \nSo far, little effort has been invested in providing affordable housing for low- and middle-income \n(LMI) groups and lack of sufficient housing is leading to severe overcrowding. As a result, more \nthan 10% of the population of Thimphu are living in hutments and squatter settlements without \nproper basic services. \n \n 4.  The situation reflects the policy constraints affecting housing supply and demand. On the \nhousing supply side, major constraints on producing sufficient affordable housing units have \nresulted  in  high  rents  and  lead  to  overcrowding  and  reduced  environmental  and  health \nstandards. Another worrying aspect of the Government\u2019s dominant role in the housing sector is \nits control of land. Unless much more public land is released for construction purposes than at \npresent, preferably on leasehold, the housing crisis will escalate and the poorest will suffer \nwhen shortages will force up the prices of existing units.  \n \n5.  On the demand side, the present situation shows an adequate supply of high-income \nunits on the market. The financial institutions explain their preference for this type of investment \nbecause of its high profitability and low risk. However, the high interest rates, down payment, \nand collateral requirements of existing housing finance schemes exclude LMI groups. The only \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared under the title \u201cUrban Housing Development\u201d in  ADB Business Opportunities, (Internet \nedition) on 13 June 2002.  \n2  In 1999, population figures for Thimphu were estimated at 40,000. ", "2 \nviable housing option left  for these groups is rental housing. Given the current Government \nbuilding regulations and affordable levels of rent, developers find it difficult to profit from \nconstructing LMI rental units.  \n \n6.  Bhutan is faced with a hard decision on how it will respond to its housing problem and \nhow it will strategically utilize its scarce resources, both financial and human, to satisfy the basic \nneed for shelter. The Government recognizes that urban housing development in the past \ndecade was skewed in favor of the higher income market. In 1997, upon the request of the \nGovernment,  ADB,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  and  Center  for  Human \nSettlements  (UNDP/UN-HABITAT),  and  the  Danish  International  Development  Assistance \n(Danida)  initiated  efforts  to  overcome  the  urban  deficiencies  of  both  Thimphu  and \nPhuentsholing. Together, the organizations sought to remedy a more than 10-year interval \nwithout  consistent  urban  development  and  housing  policies,  implement  planned  urban \ndevelopment, and provide housing for lower income people. ADB, Danida, and UNDP/UN-\nHabitat have closely coordinated with one another to complement efforts and avoid duplication. \nThe experience from previous projects and interventions is reflected in the TA design. \n \n7.  Against  this  backdrop,  ADB  assisted  the  Government  in  formulating  the  National \nHousing Policy,3 which the Cabinet of the Council of Ministers approved in 2002, to redress the \nsituation. The policy recognizes the Government\u2019 s inability to stay abreast with the demand for \nhousing, and the need for much greater private sector involvement in the sector. However, \nimplementing the housing policy remains inadequate and the Government needs to address the \nfollowing constraints to ensure sustainable and effective development of the urban housing \nsector: (i) lack of current cadastral and land registration records for the urban centers; (ii) \nextensive areas of serviced land withheld from the market for speculative purposes with the \nresult that land for housing for LMI groups is in short supply; (iii) lack of affordable housing \nfinance  options  for  LMI  groups;  (iv)  unaffordable  Government  housing  standards,  building \ncodes, and subdivision regulations, particularly for LMI households; and (v) underdeveloped and \nunorganized private construction sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will support the Government in implementing the National Housing Policy and in \npromoting a sustainable market-based system for the delivery of housing finance that meets the \nneeds of LMI households. In doing so, the TA will support the Government\u2019s goals for the \nhousing sector as set out in the 2002 National Housing Policy, namely, to (i) provide safe, basic, \nand affordable housing; (ii) promote home ownership; and (iii) create a transparent and well-\nfunctioning  housing  market.  Achieving  the  objectives  requires  a  multipronged  approach, \nincluding (i) developing a national urban land policy outlining land registration and property \nmapping procedures as well as regulations aimed  at limiting land speculation; (ii) promoting \npolicy and regulatory reforms to attract private capital flows into the sector; (iii) redefining the \nGovernment\u2019s role in the housing sector from housing provider and developer to regulator and \nadvisor; (iv) developing modalities whereby LMI groups can access adequate housing finance; \n(v)  stimulating  the  involvement  and  increasing  the  responsibilities  of  the  private  sector  in \nplanning, constructing, and maintaining LMI housing and related infrastructure.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1998. Techical Assistance to Bhutan for Capacity Building in the Urban Sector, Manila. ", "    3 \n9.  Building on the findings and recommendations of the capacity building assistance in the \nurban sector supported by ADB, UN-Habitat and Danida, the TA will examine the potential of \nexpanding the lending operations of existing financial institutions to include loans to low-income \nhouseholds, create an enabling environment for increased private sector participation in the \nhousing sector, and assist the Government with implementing the National Housing Policy. The \naccompanying policy reform agenda will promote sustainable mechanisms to facilitate access of \nLMI households to housing finance and increase access to affordable LMI housing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will (i) support the development of a strategy and time-bound action plan and \nbudget for implementing the National Housing Policy and outstanding policy reform issues; (ii) \nassist in formulating a national urban land policy; (iii) identify undeveloped and underdeveloped \nland to prioritize areas for LMI housing; (iv) assess private sector capacity to meet the growing \ndemand for LMI housing; (v) develop modalities for establishing, registering and managing \nhousing cooperatives/associations; (vi) recommend possible revisions that will create incentives \nto reduce land speculation, and encourage the development of high-density LMI housing; (vii) \ndevelop suitable modalities to phase out the Government\u2019s role as a housing provider; and (viii) \ndevelop and implement a public awareness program aimed at stimulating public interest in, and \npolitical support for, a transition to a housing market characterized by greater home ownership. \nThe TA will also identify and evaluate financial options/mechanisms for interested financial \ninstitutions to onlend to private sector developers for building LMI housing, to LMI households to \nfinance housing purchases, and to housing cooperatives/associations to finance major repairs \nand rehabilitation. The outline terms of reference for consulting services (Appendix 2) include \ndescriptions of the activities to be carried out during the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent comprising $415,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $175,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$500,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign currency costs and $85,000 equivalent in \nlocal currency costs. The Government will contribute the remaining $90,000 equivalent, which \nwill cover office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, transportation, surveys, and \nworkshops. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  MOC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented through the \nDepartment of Urban Development and Housing (DUDH) within MOC. MOC will set up a TA \nimplementing  unit;  appoint  a  manager  for  the  unit;  and  provide  office  space,  furniture, \nequipment, and counterpart staff for the TA consultants as necessary. DUDH will provide \ncounterpart technical staff to the TA consultants as required. MOC will ensure that the Planning \nCommission and the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) are closely involved in the TA, and that \ntheir concerns are fully considered. RMA will advise the consultants on the financial and lending \npolicy, and financial status of the banks. The Government will set up a technical assistance \nsteering committee (TASC), with the Director General of DADM as chair, to periodically review \nthe progress of the TA and resolve any issues that may arise. The TASC will meet at least once \nevery 2 months. The TASC will have representatives from DUDH, MOC, Planning Commission, \nRMA,  the  city  corporations,  and  others  as  necessary.  All  representatives  will  be  at  least \ndirectors. ", "4 \n13.  The TA will be carried out over 9 months, from March 2003 until December 2003. The \nconsulting team will include three international consultants (16 person-months total) and 4 \ndomestic consultants (15 person-months total). All consultants will be selected and engaged \nthrough a firm, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal format \nand the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used.  \n \n14.  The  consultants  will  submit  short  monthly  progress  reports  summarizing  project \nactivities, issues, and constraints for the duration of the TA. In addition, four major reports will \nbe submitted. An inception report will be submitted no later than 3 weeks after the consultants \nare fielded. A midterm report will be submitted 3 months after TA inception, and a draft final \nreport will be submitted 5 months after inception. Both the Government and ADB will comment \non the draft final report. The final report will be submitted within 3 weeks after comments are \nreceived. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for Housing Sector Reform, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets    and Risks \nGoal            \nIncrease access to quality  Increase in private and  Financial statements from the  Legal and institutional reforms, \nhome ownership for low-  public investment in urban  financial institutions  coupled with well-designed and \nand middle-income groups  residential real estate    focused training in the public \nand develop a viable    Government statistics  and private sector on the \nhousing finance system  Increase in economic    application and use of mortgage \n  growth of the construction  Asian Development Bank  finance, significantly contribute \nsector    (ADB) review missions and  to more equal distribution of \nprogress reports  quality housing. \nPurpose       \nHelp strengthen the  Increased housing loans  Financial institutions\u2019 surveys  Political support for institutional \nenabling environment for      reform and for liberalizing the \na well-functioning National  Increased construction of  Government statistics  supply of public building land \nHousing Policy  new housing and    will be sustained. \n  renovation of existing  ADB review missions and   \nhousing  progress reports   \n \nOutputs       \nDraft of a national urban  National urban land policy  Policy updates from  Political commitment from \nland policy and  and regulations submitted  discussions with Government  Ministry of Construction (MOC) \nimplementing regulations  to Council of Ministers  counterparts and other  to implement reforms \nready for Council of  Legal measures taken to  sources  Council of Ministers\u2019 approval of \nMinisters\u2019 approval  harmonize and clarify  ADB review missions,  proposed policy and regulations \n  provisions governing  progress and completion  Time lag in administrative \n  property and mortgage  reports  procedures \n  rights     \n \nNumber of recorded     \n \nregular titles in urban     \n \n  areas     \n       \n       \n       \nPolicy and regulatory  Increase in number of  ADB review missions,   \nreforms to attract private  registered private  progress and completion   \ncapital flows in the  developers  reports.

He/she will be accountable for the quality and \ntimeliness  of  all  deliverables,  and  ensure  that  all  components  are  clearly  and  concisely \ndocumented to the full satisfaction of the ADB project team. The team leader will ensure that \nany the TA outputs will be cohesive, financially and economically viable, and in full compliance \nwith Government policies and guidelines. \n \n5.  In addition, the housing finance and policy specialist will be specifically responsible for \nthese tasks to: \n \n(i)  Prepare a comprehensive summary and critical review of existing background \ndocumentation and studies that have been undertaken related to the housing \nsector and its development. \n(ii)  Assess  the  National  Housing  Policy  and  its  legal  status,  and  support  the \ndevelopment  of  a  strategy  and  time-bound  action  plan  and  budget  for \nimplementing it. Identify and assess outstanding policy reform issues and support \nthe development of time-bound action plans and budgets for their resolution. \nCarry  out  the  assessment  in  close  coordination  with  the  Government  and \nrepresentatives  from  the  private  sector,  financial  institutions,  and  pertinent \nnongovernment organizations. \n(iii)  Review existing background documentation and studies to determine the current \ndistribution of employment (public sector, private sector, self) and ni come in \nThimphu  and  Phuentsholing  (and  other  major  urban  centers  in  Bhutan  as \nidentified). \n(iv)  Identify and evaluate the relative affordability of an existing range of housing \noptions offered in each urban center (for LMI households), which may include \ngovernment  and  company  housing,  commercially  offered  rental  or  lease \narrangements, and private housing that is individually or cooperatively owned. ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n(v)  Make  a  comparative  assessment  of  the  mortgage  evaluation  criteria  and \nmortgage approval process used by each of the main financial institutions in \nBhutan to determine the degree to which they facilitate or constrain the approval \nof mortgage loans to LMI households. Include a review of current borrowing \noptions, associated cost of financing, and collateral requirements. \n(vi)  Undertake a sample survey in Thimphu and Phuentsholing to determine the \nsavings and borrowing patterns of LMI households. Include estimated available \nsavings; type and value of assets that could be used as collateral; extent and use \nof borrowed funds; proportion of borrowed funds used for home purchase, repair, \nrehabilitation, or expansion; and type and extent of collateral required. \n(vii)  Evaluate,  in  coordination  with  the  urban  planner,  the  relative  availability  of \nhousing options in each urban center that are affordable to LMI households, and \nestimate the current housing supply gap for these income groups. \n(viii)  Review  and  assess  local  economic  forecasts  (and  their  implications  for \nemployment and household income), and population projections, to estimate the \nfuture housing supply gap in each urban center for these income groups. \n(ix)  Prepare a summary report and discuss the findings at a workshop, with all key \nstakeholders. With the participation of the key stakeholders, identify and discuss \nthe major constraints to private sector support in developing LMI housing, and \naccess of LMI households to housing financing. Through facilitated workshop \nsessions, identify and prepare proposals for activities that would increase the \nsupply of LMI housing and access to housing finance. \n(x)  Prepare  a  concise  summary  of  the  financial  positions  of  the  main  financial \ninstitutions, describing their operational and financial performance over the past \n5-10 years and make a forecast of their planned financial position. \n(xi)  Make a comparative assessment of the household mortgage portfolios held by \neach financial institution to determine the relative proportion (in terms of both \nnumber and mortgage value) that is currently being extended to LMI households. \n(xii)  Make a comparative assessment of the excess liquidity maintained by each of \nthe main financial institutions in Bhutan and their loan portfolio strategy, to \nestimate the potential level of mortgage financing that could be made available to \nqualified applicants. \n(xiii)  Identify and evaluate possible options for addressing the financing needs of LMI \nhouseholds for housing purchases. Consider financing modalities including the \ncreation of a revolving fund for interested financial institutions in Bhutan for \nonlending  to  (a)  private  sector  developers  for  the  construction  of  new  LMI \nhousing; (b) LMI households to finance housing purchases; and (c) housing \ncooperatives/associations to finance major repairs and rehabilitation of buildings.  \n(xiv)  Develop  appropriate  guidelines  and  procedures  for  agreed-upon  financing \nmodalities. \n(xv)  Develop appropriate guidelines and procedures to manage and regulate the use \nof the fund  \u2013 prequalification criteria for participating financial institutions; the \nterms,  conditions,  and  modalities  for  channeling  funds  to  the  participating \nfinancial  institutions;  criteria  and  modalities  for  onlending  to  targeted \nbeneficiaries;  disbursement  and  evaluation  criteria;  and  requirements  for \nreporting and monitoring and evaluation. Also assess and define the institutional \nmodalities for managing the fund on a sustainable basis, and explore options that \nrequire minimal involvement of the government.  \n(xvi)  Prepare an analysis and rationalization of proposed lending and onlending rates \nand assess the potential allocation of loan funds by financial institutions to serve \nas preliminary information for project design purposes. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n(xvii)  Identify,  describe,  and  assess  the  financial  viability  and  scope  of  possible \ngovernment incentives that could be offered to private sector developers and \nfinancial institutions to encourage their increased participation in the sector and \nincreased provision of their services to LMI households. \n \nB.  Land Use Planner (international, 6 person-months) \n \n6.  The consultant will have professional training in urban and land-use planning, and will \nhave experience in assessing and improving land and housing markets in developing countries. \nIn  addition,  the  consultant  will  have  demonstrated  experience  in  land  pooling;  and \nconceptualizing, developing, and implementing financially viable, private-sector-led low-income \nhousing projects in the developing world, preferably in South Asia. The specific tasks follow: \n \n(i)  Assess the current and proposed zoning, urban development plans, structure \nplans, and local area plans; determine the degree to which realistic economic \nforecasts  and  population  projections  have  been  appropriately  incorporated. \nCompare  the  plans  with  current  ownership  patterns  and  maps  of  existing \ndevelopment to identify efficient strategies for phasing the development of land \nfor LMI housing, and densifying the overall urban settlements of Thimphu and \nPhuentsholing. \n(ii)  From (i), identify priority parcels of government and privately owned serviced \nland that need to be released for housing development. Also identify key private \nlandholdings that are yet to be serviced. Focus the assessment on the optimal \nuse of serviced core city properties.
