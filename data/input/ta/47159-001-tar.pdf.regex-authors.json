The government request for technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the financial sector \nthrough capacity development of the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) and to support financial \ninclusion arose from a series of technical exchanges organized by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  between  the  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (BSP)  and  CBM. 1 Through  these \nengagements, the priority areas covered by this proposed TA were developed and government \ninterest for ADB support was confirmed.2 The government\u2019s executing agency (CBM) agreed on \nthe  proposed  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  and  financing \narrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.3 In  line  with  the  interim  country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u20132014, this TA will support two key program areas, building human \ncapacity and building institutional capacity. This TA will also help lay the foundation for medium \nand longer-term engagement and effective development processes. The project design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES   \n2.  The government has set out a challenging economic reform agenda to raise economic \ngrowth  to  sustainable  levels  and  to  ensure  this  growth  is  inclusive  across  different \nsocioeconomic groups and subregions. This agenda was described in a policy-based loan, \nSupport to Myanmar\u2019s Reforms for Inclusive Growth, approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in \nJanuary 2013.5 The agenda included (i) macroeconomic stabilization; (ii) trade, investment, and \nfinancial  integration;  (iii)  stimulating  rural  development;  and  (iv)  promoting  human  capital \ndevelopment.  The  government\u2019s  reform  agenda  started  with  macroeconomic  stabilization, \nbased on a unified exchange rate the authorities floated in April 2012. To anchor the floating \nexchange rate, the government introduced a basic monetary policy framework targeting reserve \nmoney implemented through deposit auctions. The CBM also initiated a comprehensive and \ncomplex set of reforms for central banking and financial sector development. Importantly for the \nproposed TA, the new Central Bank of Myanmar Law was enacted on 11 July 2013, giving the \nCBM significant administrative and financial autonomy. The CBM will need to restructure its \norganization to implement the new central bank law effectively. Given its rapid assumption of \nsignificant oversight and control over monetary policy and the broader economy, the CBM \nconsiders  capacity  building  of  CBM  staff  in  central  banking  functions  and  finance  sector \ndevelopment as its highest and most urgent priority to support its reform agenda, including \nmacroeconomic stabilization over the medium term, and financial sector development over the \nlonger term. Support will be required across all areas of CBM operations, with emphasis on \n                                                \n1  The first phase of this engagement took place in February 2013 and consisted of a joint ADB\u2013BSP mission to the \nCBM in Nay Pyi Taw. The 2-day technical discussion workshop between staff from the CBM, ADB, and BSP \nfocused on a variety of topics including financial sector development and microfinance. The second phase of this \nengagement consisted of a 2-week training course in June 2013 at BSP in Manila, which helped to identify the \npriority areas covered by this proposed TA and was attended by 12 senior CBM staff under ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Improving Fiscal Revenue Mobilization. Manila (TA 8156-\nMYA). \n2  Having identified key areas of potential support during the exchanges, a reconnaissance mission in May 2013 and \nfact-finding mission in September 2013 were undertaken to meet with senior central bank staff, including with the \nnewly appointed deputy governors. The mission included discussions with key microfinance sector stakeholders \nand a field visit with clients, which helped identify ways to support financial inclusion in Myanmar. \n3  A technical assistance framework agreement was signed between the government and ADB on 10 July 2013. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 October 2013. \n5  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan  \nto the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Support to Myanmar\u2019s Reforms for Inclusive Growth Program. Manila. \n ", "2   \noverall capacity development of functional competencies, human resources management, and \npayment systems.  \n \n3.  The CBM is also looking at ways to develop the domestic financial sector to promote \ninclusive  growth.  Currently,  the  financial  sector  is  shallow,  inefficient,  and  high-cost.  The \noutreach  of  financial  services  is  focused  primarily  on  urban  areas.  Significant  institutional \nstrengthening and the introduction of responsible finance practices are needed, particularly at \nthe microfinance  level,  to  address rapid financial  sector  development and  growth. Without \nappropriate safeguards the consequence could be a destabilized economy, a decline in portfolio \nquality among financial institutions, and an increase in overindebtedness among clients.  \n \n4.  Recognizing this, the government adopted a Microfinance Law in November 2011, which \nestablished a new framework for allowing local and foreign investors to operate as privately \nowned entities in the sector. Because of extremely low capital requirements for both non-\ndeposit- and deposit-taking microfinance institutions (MFIs), 166 MFIs are now licensed (as of \nSeptember  2013).  Housed  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Myanmar  Microfinance \nSupervisory Enterprise (MMSE) is responsible for licensing and supervising MFIs. The sector is \nfurther challenged by the limited differentiation between deposit-taking and non-deposit-taking \nMFIs and an interest rate ceiling.6 In light of the low capacity level of the microfinance regulator \n(MMSE), the  ease  of  obtaining  a  license to  issue  credit  or take  deposits,  and the recent \nconsumer protection and credit crisis experience of neighboring countries, there is a critical \nneed for the development of basic standards of consumer protection at the microfinance level \nand at the level of commercial banks.  To further protect clients, a financial literacy strategy is \nneeded. Because of the key role microfinance associations play as platforms for dialogue \nbetween service providers and the regulator and the assistance associations can provide in \ncoordinating and monitoring client protection and in setting important standards for the sector, \nADB\u2019s  support  through  the  TA  will  also  help  strengthen  the  newly  formed  microfinance \nassociation. ADB\u2019s meso-level support to the microfinance sector will complement the direct \nsupport currently being provided by other development partners to the microfinance regulator.  \n \n5.  Packaged  together,  the  two  elements  of  the  proposed  financial  sector  support  will \nstrengthen the overall provision of financial services to the people of Myanmar. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  Through both targeted and flexible capacity building at the CBM and in the microfinance \nsector, the overall impact of the TA will be improved financial sector intermediation in the long \nterm. A strong central bank and a strong framework for financial inclusion will improve the \nquality of financial services offered to businesses and individuals. The outcome of the TA will be \na strengthened institutional and policy framework for financial sector development including \nestablishment of a strategic framework for responsible finance. The outcome will support CBM's \ntransition to institutional and budgetary independence by strengthening its human resources \nstrategy, which will support both more effective implementation of fiscal and monetary policy \nand better regulation and supervision of the financial sector, and will promote financial inclusion \nto benefit all people in Myanmar. \n                                                \n6  In January 2012, the CBM lowered the minimum deposit rate from 10% to 8%, and the maximum loan rate from \n15% to 13%. This narrow spread of 5% discourages banks from reaching the lower end of the market segment \nbecause of higher operating costs.   \n ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n7.  This TA aims to respond to immediate and longer-term needs of the CBM through direct, \ntargeted  capacity  building  and  through  a  flexible  training  fund  that  can  support  staff  and \ninstitutional capacity building in a variety of ways. For financial inclusion, TA will focus on meso-\nlevel support for the development of a responsible finance and financial literacy strategy that will \ninclude microfinance institutions with consumer protection principles extending to commercial \nbanks as well. To support achievement of the outcome, the TA consists of two outputs. \n \n8.  Output 1: Central Bank of Myanmar institutional and staff capacity strengthened. \nOutput 1 will utilize a team of consultants to support the CBM in a range of key areas including \n(i) human resources management, (ii) immersion training, and (iii) payments and settlement \nsystems. The TA will strengthen the CBM\u2019s ability to manage its own internal and externally \nprovided training. It will support the development of a human resources skills assessment, \nfollowed by a comprehensive human resources action plan with identification of compensation \nlevels and clear career development paths. The TA will also identify the immediate and longer-\nterm human resource needs of the CBM. Specific support will be provided for immersion training \nexperiences to ensure that lessons learned can be applied after completion of the training. \nFinally, the TA will provide inputs to assist the CBM in managing and implementing planned \nreforms to the payment and settlement system. In particular, CBM has requested TA to provide \nindependent advice to support the evaluation of alternative payment and settlement systems \nbeing offered by various donors, as the subsequent selection and implementation of the system. \nThe consultant input will be enhanced through a variety of training and exposure activities as \nidentified throughout the course of the support. \n \n9.  Output 2: Support framework for financial inclusion enhanced. Output 2 will focus \non strengthening meso-level support for financial inclusion in Myanmar. This output will target \nkey microfinance stakeholders in Myanmar, including the microfinance regulator (MMSE) and  \nmicrofinance service providers. Areas of focus will include the development of (i) a responsible \nfinance strategy, (ii) a strong microfinance association that will serve as a platform for dialogue \nbetween the microfinance regulator and microfinance service providers, and (iii) a financial \nliteracy  strategy.  The  TA  will  be  part  of  a  multi-donor  effort  to  strengthen  and  grow  the \nmicrofinance sector, and expand access and quality of access to financial services. The TA will \nhelp  establish  the  foundation  for  a  longer-term  engagement  around  responsible  finance, \nincluding  consumer  protection  and  market  conduct,  which  includes  Smart  Campaign client \nprotection principles, and financial literacy.7 An assessment of consumer protection measures \nwithin the Myanmar financial sector will be performed at the regulatory and institutional levels, \nand recommendations will be developed to strengthen the consumer protection framework. An \nexposure visit to relevant microfinance actors in the Philippines (regulators and supervisors, \nassociations, and financial service providers) for key microfinance stakeholders from Myanmar \nwill  contribute greatly  to  the  development  of this  output.8 Finally,  this output  will  focus  on \nassisting  in  the  development  of  an  action  plan  for  strengthening  dialogue  between  the \nmicrofinance regulator and microfinance service providers.  \n \n10.  While a number of government and nongovernment entities will be engaged through the \nTA, the CBM will be the executing and implementing agency.9 \n                                                \n7  The Smart Campaign is a global effort to unite microfinance leaders around a common goal: to keep clients as the \ndriving force of the industry. \n8  All associated activities will be carried out in close partnership with a number of development partners. \n9  Depending on the need, a task force could be created to facilitate the development of the responsible finance and \nfinancial literacy strategy. \n ", "4   \n \n11.  For both outputs, the CBM has requested that all capacity development efforts be linked, \nto the extent possible, with immersion opportunities wherein staff can experience how central \nbanks fulfill their functions from an operational perspective. To meet this request, ADB has \nclosely collaborated with the BSP to provide training to CBM staff, as the BSP implemented a \nsimilar transition process of strengthening operations and capacity development in mid-2000. \nGiven the success of that engagement, and the CBM\u2019s request for additional partnerships of this \ntype,  this  TA  combines  capacity  development  with  \u201ctwinning\u201d  relationships  that  support  all \ncomponents  as  a  crosscutting  theme.  Direct  contact  with  additional  regional  peers  will \naccelerate the CBM\u2019s capacity to apply newly learned skills, enhancing the effectiveness of the \nTA\u2019s outputs.  \n \n12.  Improvements in financial sector intermediation assume that the political environment in \nMyanmar  will  remain  stable  and  will  continue  to  encourage foreign  investment.  They  also \nassume that the CBM can effectively enhance financial sector intermediation while maintaining \nmonetary  stability  and  fiscal  oversight.  However,  these  improvements  will  be  negatively \nimpacted if the rapid growth in the size and complexity of the financial sector outruns the ability \nof the CBM to implement the necessary reforms. Similarly, slow reforms coupled with significant \nprice  instability  or  a  macroeconomic  shock  could  destabilize  the  economy  and  weaken \nconsumer or investor confidence. To achieve the outcome of a strengthened institutional and \npolicy  framework  for  financial  sector  development,  it  is  assumed  that  the  government  will \ncontinue to support the reform agenda of the CBM, support inclusive finance, and move toward \nan approach of proportionate regulation of the microfinance sector. Risks to achieving this goal \nwould be if the political will is not sufficient to provide the CBM with operational and fiscal \nindependence; or if the CBM is overwhelmed by capacity building opportunities and is unable to \nidentify or focus on key priorities. A strong framework for financial inclusion will be even more \nimportant if the government maintains interest rate ceilings (on credit) and minimum interest \nrates (on deposits), restricting the ability of microfinance providers to offer sustainable financial \nservices,  or  motivating  unscrupulous  practices  such  as  charging  of  hidden  fees.  Both \nmicrofinance and commercial finance providers will need to commit to practicing responsible \nfinance  under  proportionate  prudential  supervision  and  through  self-regulation,  so  that \nconsumers will be adequately protected. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,010,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation for \ninternational consultants. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements   \n15.  The executing agency will be the CBM. CBM will also be the counterpart or anchor for \nthe microfinance sector, considering the CBM\u2019s interest in being engaged in responsible finance \nand a wider financial literacy strategy.  \n \n16.  Under  output  1,  three  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  individual \nconsultant selection. A capacity development advisor (5 person-months, intermittent) will assist \nthe CBM in implementing the lessons learned from immersion experiences. A human resources \ndevelopment advisor (9 person-months, intermittent) will be retained to develop and execute a \n ", "  5 \nhuman resources strategy. A payments and settlements technical advisor (3 person-months, \nintermittent) will provide strategic advice on payments and settlements. Under output 2, two \ninternational consultants (a financial inclusion advisor and a financial literacy advisor) will be \nengaged  through  individual  consultant  selection  to  support  MMSE  and  other  microfinance \nstakeholders to develop and strengthen a framework for responsible finance. All consultants will \nbe selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Outputs 1 and 2 will include funding for short- or medium-term immersion \nexperiences, including courses, workshops, on-the-job training, secondments, and exchanges \nas identified by the CBM and ADB. Appendix 3 contains the terms of reference for consultants. \n \n17.  The  TA,  to  be  administered  by  ADB,  will  be  implemented  from  January  2014  to \nDecember  2015.  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). No procurement will be done \nunder this TA. \n \n18.  As the majority of the TA activities relate to staff capacity building, the dissemination of \noutputs will have to rely on reports monitoring the development of skills among staff. The \nresponsible  finance  and  financial  literacy  strategies  will  become  public  documents.  The \ndissemination plan for these strategies will be through public workshops. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Myanmar for Financial Sector Reforms, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved financial  By end of 2017:    Political environment \nsector intermediation       remains stable and \nin the long term  Total financial assets,  CBM Reports  continues to \nmeasured as M2,     encourage foreign \nas a % of GDP    investment \nincreases by 10%     \n    CBM can effectively \n(Baseline 2013: 36%)    enhance financial \n    sector intermediation \nNumber of credit and  Integrated Household  while maintaining \nsavings accounts held  Living Conditions  monetary stability and \nin microfinance  Survey   fiscal oversight \ninstitutions increased  in Myanmar: Poverty   \nby 10%   Profile (tentatively   Risks \n  expected in 2014\u2013 Rapid growth in the \n(Baseline 2013:   2015), Ministry of  size and complexity of \n2,808,982 borrowers  Planning and   the financial sector \nand 2,657,353 deposit  Economic  outrun CBM\u2019s ability to \naccounts)a  Development  implement necessary \ndisaggregated by sexb   reforms \n \nPrice instability or a \nmacroeconomic shock \ndestabilizes the \neconomy and weakens \nconsumer or investor \nconfidence \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened  By end of 2015:    Government will \ninstitutional and policy      continue to support the \nframework for financial  Increased transparency  CBM policy briefings  reform agenda of the \nsector development   of financial indicators    CBM and inclusive \n  and government policy  ADB mission review  finance \ndirection.     \n  Consultant progress  Government moves \n(Baseline = 0;  reports  toward an approach of \nCBM does not publish    proportionate \nregular macro-   regulation of the \neconomic data and    microfinance sector \npolicy briefings)     \n    Risks \nClear policy framework  CBM Reports  Political will is not \nfor financial inclusion    sufficient to provide \nand financial literacy    CBM with operational \nprovided    and fiscal \n    independence \n      \n   \n   \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \n  CBM is overwhelmed \n  by capacity building \n  opportunities and is \n  unable to identify or \n  focus on key priorities \n   \nGovernment maintains \ninterest rate ceilings \n(credit) and minimum \nrate (deposits), \nrestricting ability of \nmicrofinance providers \nto offer sustainable \nfinancial services \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
