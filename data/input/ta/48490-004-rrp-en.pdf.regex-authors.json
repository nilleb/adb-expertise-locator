THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of Fiji for subprogram 3 of the Sustained Private Sector-Led Growth \nReform Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed subprogram 3 supports the government to create an environment in which \nthe private sector can drive economic growth through investment, improve management of public \nfinances, strengthen the performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and open private \ninvestment opportunities, and improve the business and investment climate. The coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) and associated containment measures have negatively affected the private \nsector in Fiji. The program supports the government\u2019s immediate response to COVID-19 as the \ngovernment seeks to support businesses through this period. The reforms will support the \neconomy\u2019s recovery from COVID-19 and build resilience to future economic and fiscal shocks. It \nsupports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priority on strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, particularly in small island developing states.2  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Programmatic approach. The programmatic approach aligns ADB\u2019s support with the \ngovernment\u2019s reform program over the medium to long term. It supports reforms to improve (i) \nfiscal management, particularly public financial management (PFM); (ii) the policy, legal, and \ninstitutional framework for SOEs and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs); and (iii) the business \nand investment climate. The programmatic approach and loan of $15 million for subprogram 1 \nwere both approved in June 2018. At the time of approval of the programmatic approach, it was \nindicated that subsequent loan amounts would equal $55 million for subprogram 2 (in 2019) and \n$110 million for subprogram 3 (in 2020), resulting in overall financial support of $180 million across \nthe three subprograms. To help the government meet its revised financing needs, the subprogram \n2 loan was approved in September 2019 for $65 million, $10 million above the originally indicated \namount, with the planned subprogram 3 loan to be reduced by a corresponding amount to $100 \nmillion.3 However, at the request of the government, the loan amount for subprogram 3 is now \nproposed to be increased to $200 million to help support the government\u2019s response to COVID-\n19 in FY2020. \n  \n4.  Subprogram 1 laid strong reform foundations, such as a PFM reform roadmap, legislative \nactions, and diagnostic efforts. Subprogram 2 focused on the gradual implementation of these \ninitiatives, while initiating new reforms when sufficient institutional capacity was present. All policy \nactions achieved during subprograms 1 and 2 continue to be complied with. Subprogram 3 \ncompletes reforms initiated in subprograms 1 and 2, but also takes stock and lays foundations for \nfuture reforms. The inclusion of a post-program partnership framework (PPPF) and ongoing \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The program is in ADB. 2019.

Development context. While Fiji is classified as an upper-middle income country, it faces \nconstraints  common  among  small  island  developing  states,  including  a  remote  location,  a \ngeographically dispersed population, a high-cost business environment, and vulnerability to \ndisasters triggered by natural hazards. A narrow economic base and heavy reliance on the \ntourism industry make it vulnerable to external shocks.4 Public investment remains a key factor \ndriving the economy. While Fiji recorded only 18 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of 25 June \n2020 and declared itself free of active cases on 5 June 2020, COVID-19 is having a devastating \nsocial, economic, and fiscal impact on Fiji, which is primarily driven by the shutdown of the tourism \nindustry. A growing and inclusive private sector will be crucial in supporting recovery and \nbroadening the economic base to build resilience and reduce economic volatility.  \n \n6.  Recent economic performance and shock. Fiji experienced uninterrupted economic \ngrowth  from  2010  to  2019,  supported  by  sound  macroeconomic  policies,  including  an \nexpansionary fiscal policy; a low interest rate environment; policy consistency; and improving \nbusiness confidence. Fiji\u2019s growing tourism industry and remittances supported  its external \nposition. Economic growth fell to 0.5% in 2019 as a global economic slowdown coincided with \ngovernment efforts to reduce fiscal stimulus, while growth had been projected to increase to 2.5% \nin 2020.5 However, as a result of COVID-19, all regularly scheduled international flights have \nbeen suspended since 26 March 2020, and hotels and tourism service providers have ceased \noperations, temporarily laying off workers. The initial shock to the accommodation sector has \nspread to other sectors, including wholesale and retail trade, construction, transport, real estate, \nand finance.6 COVID-19 containment measures have further depressed domestic economic \nactivity.7 Remittance inflows, which are equivalent to about 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), \nare also expected to decline significantly. Furthermore, tropical cyclone Harold struck Fiji on 8\u20139 \nApril 2020, directly affecting more than 20% of the population, and causing at least $46.4 million \nin damage. As a result of the combined impact of these shocks, the economy is forecast to \ncontract by 15.0% in 2020.8 Assuming that there is no sustained local outbreak of COVID-19 in \nFiji, the depth and duration of the economic shock will depend primarily on the duration of \ninternational travel restrictions in key tourism source markets, such as Australia and New Zealand.  \n \n7.  Fiscal situation and shock. Reliance on public sector-led growth resulted in an average \nfiscal deficit of 3.3% from FY2014 to FY2019 (Table 1).9 Recognizing the need to rebuild fiscal \nbuffers, the FY2020 national budget passed in July 2019 laid out a path of fiscal consolidation, \nwith projected fiscal deficits equivalent to 2.7% of GDP in FY2020, 2.0% of GDP in FY2021, and \n1.5% of GDP in FY2022. The impact of COVID-19 has disrupted this effort. The government \nannounced a COVID-19 response budget on 23 March 2020 that includes a $460 million response \n \n4  The government estimates that the tourism industry contributed 34% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017. \nGovernment of Fiji.

The forecast is based on the assumption of gradual easing of international travel restrictions from the fourth \nquarter of 2020, resulting in a slow recovery of tourism arrivals. The IMF has projected GDP will contract by 18.4% \nin 2020 and rebound by 11.5% in 2021 (footnote 6). \n9  For purposes of comparison, fiscal year data is shown, sourced from government budget documents and ADB \nestimates.

The \nwidening deficit is driven by a projected decline in total revenue equivalent to 5.3% of GDP from \nFY2019 to FY2020. Public debt is projected to increase from 48.9% of GDP in FY2019 to 60.9% \nof GDP in FY2020, and is expected to rise further in FY2021. Despite rising quickly in the context \nof COVID-19, public debt is expected to remain manageable and stabilize at around 70% of GDP \nin subsequent years, supported by continued sound macroeconomic policies and renewed fiscal \nconsolidation.10  \n \nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \nItem  FY2014  FY2015  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018  FY2019e  FY2020p \nReal GDP growth (% change)  5.6  4.7  2.5  5.4  3.5  0.5  (15.0) \nCPI change (% annual average)  0.5  1 .4  3 .9   3.3  4 .1  1.8   1.2  \nCentral government budget (% of GDP) \n  Total revenue  25.9  28.5  28.8  26.6  28.6  27.1  21.8 \n  Total expenditure  29.7  30.4  32.6  28.7  33.0  30.7  30.8 \n  Operating balance  6.1  6.8  6.8  7.4  7.7  5.9  (1.3) \n  Asset sales  0.1  1.9  1.9  0.0  0.0  0.0  1.8 \n  Fiscal (deficit)  (3.8)  (1.8)  (3.8)  (2.1)  (4.4)  (3.6)  (9.0) \nPublic debt (% of GDP)  44.5  43.0  44.0  43.9  46.0  48.9  60.9 \n  of which: External debt  13.7  12.7  13.1  12.9  12.8  12.4  17.4 \nNominal GDP ($ million)  4,850.3  4,682.5  4,930.2  5,353.5  5,536.8  5,483.3  4,711.6 \n( ) = negative, CPI = consumer price index, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection. \nNote: 2020 GDP numbers are a projection by the Asian Development Bank.

Fiji\u2019s narrow economic base, high import demand, and \nweak merchandise export sector make it susceptible to external shocks. From 2010 to 2018, \ngrowth was driven by public investment.11 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended \n(i) gradually reducing the fiscal deficit to achieve a downward trend in the ratio of public debt-to-\nGDP; (ii) enhancing the business environment and strengthening governance to foster private \ninvestment, enhance productivity, and raise potential growth; and (iii) tackling the gender gap in \nlabor force participation to boost inclusive economic growth (footnote 6). While continued fiscal \nstimulus is considered appropriate in response to COVID-19, business environment reform is \ncritical to support the economic recovery and build resilience to future economic and fiscal shocks. \nAs a regional hub for business, transport, and communications, the recovery of Fiji\u2019s private sector \nand SOEs will also play an important role in the economic recovery of the Pacific region. \n \n9.  Binding constraints. The government recognizes the challenges it faces in reducing \nreliance on public sector-led growth, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. It must gradually ease \nfiscal stimulus to rebuild fiscal buffers, while improving the effectiveness of public investment and \nthe strategic allocation of resources. To do so, the government must (i) regularly review public \nsector performance, such as through Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) \nassessments and public expenditure reviews, to prioritize expenditure and reforms; (ii) strengthen \nthe strategic planning and budget process to ensure that the lifetime costs of investments are \n \n10 The IMF assessed (i) the fiscal stimulus to be appropriate given the severity of the shock and the need for a counter-\ncyclical response; and (ii) public debt to be sustainable, despite the rapid rise in debt in 2020 as a result of the impact \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Public debt as a proportion of GDP is expected to peak in 2020 and then decline, helped \nby a rebound in growth that will boost fiscal revenues and increase GDP, but this medium-term path is vulnerable to \nsignificant risks (footnote 6). Updated medium-term fiscal projections will be published in the FY2021 national budget. \n11 Total investment averaged 19.9% of GDP in 2010\u20132018. Public investment rose from 3.6% of GDP in 2010\u20132013 to \n5.6% of GDP in 2014\u20132018. Private and SOE investment fell from 12.5% of GDP to 11.7% of GDP over the same \nperiod.

It must also improve SOE performance, as SOEs deliver most infrastructure \nservices in Fiji. To do so, the government must strengthen policy and institutional frameworks for \ngovernment  ownership  of  SOEs  and  financial  transactions  with  SOEs  (onlending  and \nguarantees).  Improved  governance  and  performance  will  help  SOEs  access  finance  on \ncommercial terms. It must facilitate private sector participation to bring in investment, innovation, \nand expertise; and in doing so must have clear privatization and PPP policies and guidelines, and \ntransparently  pursue  divestment  and  PPPs,  where  feasible.  The  government  must  also \nstrengthen the business climate to facilitate private investment by (i) reforming outdated foreign \ninvestment  and  competition  legislation,  (ii)  removing  barriers  to  international  trade,  (iii) \nimplementing collateral reforms to facilitate innovation and access to finance, (iv) streamlining \nconstruction permit applications and approvals, and (v) strengthening intellectual property rights. \nIt must also support businesses to withstand the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n10.  Government  strategy.  The  government\u2019s  National  Development  Plan,  2017\u20132036 \nenvisions inclusive socioeconomic development through a strategy to become a regional South \nPacific hub for business, transport, and other services.12 To contain the COVID-19 outbreak and \nlimit the risk of local transmission, the government developed (i) a $38.4 million health system \npreparedness and response plan; and (ii) a $460 million COVID-19 response budget with \nmeasures to boost the economy, and provide social protection for the poor and vulnerable. With \nsupport from ADB and other development partners, the government is accelerating reforms to \naddress binding constraints to private sector-led growth (para. 9). These reforms will support \neconomic recovery from COVID-19 and build resilience to future economic and fiscal shocks.  \n \n11.  Increased Subprogram 3 Loan Amount. The programmatic approach provides flexibility \nto respond to emerging opportunities and constraints. In subprogram 3, this includes supporting \nthe government\u2019s rapid response to the impacts of COVID-19, as outlined in the COVID-19 \nresponse budget, and for which the government has requested an increase in the ADB loan \namount for subprogram 3 from $100 million to $200 million.13 The proposed increase in the loan \namount reflects the alignment of the reform areas with the focal areas of the government\u2019s COVID-\n19 response. The use of the policy-based loan modality in FY2020 maintains the government\u2019s \nreform momentum and expands this to reflect relevant COVID-19 responses, leaving open the \npossibility  of  the  use  of  a  COVID-19  Pandemic  Response  Option  operation  in  FY2021,  if \nrequested by the government, in the case that additional government stimulus measures are \nrequired to address an extended period of COVID-19 related border closures.14 \n \n12.  Alignment. The program (i) supports the government\u2019s COVID-19 response; (ii) is aligned \nwith the government\u2019s policy priorities in the National Development Plan; and (iii) is aligned with \nthe values and objectives of the Framework for Pacific Regionalism.15 The program is consistent \n \n12 Government of Fiji, Ministry of Economy. 2017. 5-Year & 20-Year National Development Plan: Transforming Fiji. \nSuva. \n13 Government of Fiji, Ministry of Economy. 2020.

Policy actions. Implementation of the government\u2019s structural reform agenda underpins \nthe provision of policy-based lending from ADB and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \n(AIIB), and linked grants from the governments of Australia and New Zealand.17 Subprogram 3 \nactions build on reforms undertaken through subprograms 1 and 2, and reforms will continue as \noutlined in the PPPF. Under subprogram 3, ADB supports 23 policy actions across three reform \nareas contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 4) and described in paras. 15\u201317. All 23 policy \nactions have been completed.18 \n \n14.  Some indicative actions for subprogram 3 were adjusted. The overall strength has been \nimproved with the addition of new policy actions, including relating to the government\u2019s COVID-\n19 response, and changes to increase the substance of the policy actions.19 The strengthened \nmatrix reflects the additional financing requested by the government.  \n(i)  Six actions were added to subprogram 3. A PEFA assessment and a PEFA self-\nassessment of gender-responsive PFM were completed. Fiji\u2019s Cabinet decided to \nintroduce gender-responsive budgeting (GRB) in the FY2021 budget; budget \nsubmission templates that incorporate associated principles were introduced and \npiloted by two ministries. This is a critical step to ensure the strategic allocation of \nresources for government priorities in future budgets. Through the COVID-19 \nresponse budget, additional resources were allocated for COVID-19 containment \nand treatment, and the total budgeted expenditure was reduced to contain the \nfiscal deficit in a fiscally sustainable manner; specific measures to assist the private \nsector were also approved.  \n(ii)  Several indicative actions were changed to increase their substance. Fiji\u2019s solicitor-\ngeneral has notified the secretary-general of the Parliament that four bills approved \nby  the  Cabinet\u2014on  investment,  trademarks,  designs,  and  patents\u2014will  be \nintroduced in a regular 2020 sitting of Parliament, through the Solicitor-General\u2019s \nletter of 23 June 2020 on Introduction of Certain Bills to Parliament.20 A planning \nframework  to  align  the  service  delivery,  staffing,  and  corporate  planning \nrequirements of ministries was implemented across all government ministries \nahead of schedule. The government exceeded its own targets for shifting from \nmanual to digital payments. \n \n16 ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n17 The Government of New Zealand joined subprograms 2 and 3, and AIIB and the Government of Australia have joined \nSubprogram 3, all aligned to the ADB policy matrix. The World Bank\u2019s Fiscal Sustainability and Climate Resilience \nDevelopment Policy Operation and Fiji Second Fiscal Sustainability and Climate Resilience Development Policy \nOperation were aligned to the matrix in subprograms 1 and 2, and the World Bank is preparing a new operation for \napproval in late 2020. \n18 The program does not distinguish between prior actions (triggers) and policy milestones, with these collectively \nreferred to as policy actions. Milestones strengthen the program and lay the foundation for ongoing reform. \n19 Further details and reasons for the changes are summarized in Changes from Subprogram 3 Indicative Policy Actions \nto Final Policy Actions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 This allows for a notice to be published in the Gazette and the bills to be introduced in a regular sitting of Parliament \nin 2020. \n ", "6 \n(iii)  Two actions were removed from subprogram 3. Cabinet approval of a Public \nFinancial Management Bill for tabling in Parliament has been delayed due to a \nchange in the development partner providing TA and staff turnover, and this will \nbe pursued through the PPPF. An action related to the appointment or use of \ntransaction advisory services for PPP transactions was removed, as it was not \nrelevant in the subprogram 3 period, as no new PPP transactions were initiated.21  \n \n15.

The government recognizes that sound \nPFM systems and processes that promote fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and \nefficient service delivery provide the private sector with policy certainty and business confidence, \nas well as more cost-effective public services. In the immediate term this area addresses the \neconomic and social risks of COVID-19 by mobilizing the government response in a fiscally \nsustainable manner. The following subprogram 3 policy actions support this outcome: \n(i)  Public financial management framework. The Ministry of Economy (MOE) \ncontinued  to  implement  the  Public  Financial  Management  Improvement \nProgramme, 2016\u20132019 approved in subprogram 1.22 A high-level, multi-sector \npublic expenditure review of health, education, capital spending, and personnel \nwas completed, and a synopsis was published on the MOE\u2019s website. The public \nexpenditure review analyzes public finance effectiveness and consistency with \npolicy  priorities.  Strengthening  of  the  budget  process  continued  through  the \nincorporation of forward estimates, and by linking investments and recurring costs \nin  the  FY2021  budget  submission  templates.  In  subprogram  2,  a  planning \nframework to align service delivery, staffing, and corporate planning requirements \nwas piloted by four ministries. In subprogram 3, all ministries have adopted its use \nwell ahead of a planned expansion to three additional ministries in subprogram 3. \nA PEFA assessment was completed and published that will guide the development \nof a new PFM roadmap.23 Fiji was one of seven countries globally to pilot the PEFA \nself-assessment  of  gender-responsive  PFM,  and  received  \u201cPEFA  check\u201d \napproval.24 The assessment informed the government\u2019s GRB pilot and provides a \nmodel  for  adoption  by  other  countries  in  the  Pacific.  Parliament  passed  a \nsupplementary COVID-19 response budget that allocates additional resources for \nCOVID-19 containment and treatment, reduces budgeted expenditures to contain \nthe fiscal deficit in a fiscally sustainable manner, and provides updated key fiscal \nprojections (including on revenue, expenditure, and debt). \n(ii)  Financial management. To guide improvements in the FMIS, the responsible \nminister approved the recommendations of the review undertaken in subprogram \n2, and the MOE is writing detailed business and technical requirements to enable \nthe  purchase  of  two  priority  modules  (budget  reporting  and  monitoring,  and \nbusiness intelligence). While an upgrade of the whole FMIS is planned, updating \nof these modules will enable immediate improvements. The government now \n \n21  Existing PPP transactions continue with transaction advisors appointed under subprograms 1 and 2. The removed \naction required the government to use transaction advisors for any new PPPs. In a small island developing state \nsuch as Fiji, it is not expected that potential PPP transactions would be ready for appointment of advisors each year. \nThe government is assessing new PPP opportunities, including with TA from ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private \nPartnership.  \n22 Government of Fiji. 2016. Fiji Public Financial Management Improvement Programme 2016\u20132019. Suva. \n23 The previous PEFA assessment was undertaken in 2013, but the report was neither endorsed by the government \nnor published. The 2020 PEFA assessment demonstrates improvements in PFM since 2013, and its publication \ndemonstrates the government\u2019s commitment to transparency and increased accountability. \n24 The PEFA Check confirms that the processes used in planning and implementing a PEFA assessment and preparing \na PEFA report comply with the PEFA 2016 methodology and other guidance issued by the PEFA Secretariat.  \n ", "7 \nmakes 92% of payments digitally, including for social welfare recipients as part of \nthe COVID-19 response. \n(iii)  Gender-responsive budgeting. The MOE has embraced the potential gains from \nintroducing  GRB.  While  completing  the  PEFA  self-assessment,  practical \nimplementation  efforts  have  included  procuring  software  to  enable  \u201cgender \ntagging\u201d and a Cabinet decision on introducing and rolling out GRB. The MOE \nworked with the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation (MWCPA) to \ndevelop a methodology that will be used by two pilot ministries for their budget \nsubmissions for FY2021.25 Lessons from the pilot will be used to inform and \nexpand GRB in Fiji and across the region. \n \n16.  Reform  area  2:  Policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  for  state-owned \nenterprises  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  improved.  Fiji\u2019s  SOEs  provide  most \ninfrastructure services in Fiji, and play an important role for trade and tourism connectivity in the \nPacific region.26 SOE profitability has improved markedly since 2010, but productivity remains low \nin many SOEs, and the government is seeking to improve their performance, including through \nSOE divestment, outsourcing, and PPPs to increase private sector investment, innovation, and \nexpertise.27 Reforms to improve SOEs\u2019 financial management and internal governance will enable \nSOEs to access finance on commercial terms, which will help them to withstand economic shocks, \nincluding those associated with COVID-19. With ADB support, the following subprogram 3 policy \nactions have been implemented: \n(i)  State-owned enterprise reform. The Public Enterprises Act 2019 was passed by \nParliament in subprogram 2 to strengthen SOE governance, transparency, and \naccountability; and improve performance and service delivery. It has come into \nforce,  and  required  regulations  are  in  place.28  Training  programs  on  the \ncompliance requirements of the Public Enterprises Act 2019 have been conducted, \ncovering 76% of directors and 80% of senior management, including 90% of \nwomen in these roles.29 Cabinet has approved a new policy for onlending to \ngovernment entities, including SOEs, to better manage associated fiscal risks; the \nonlending policy complements a guarantee policy approved in subprogram 2. \nPrivatization guidelines have come into force, with clear and transparent rules and \nprocedures for preparing and executing SOE divestments. The onlending policy \nand privatization guidelines were published on the MOE\u2019s website. \n(ii)  Divestment and public\u2013private partnerships. Two SOEs\u2014Food Processors \n(Fiji) Limited and Fiji Rice Limited\u2014have restructured their balance sheets through \nthe sale of non-core assets, including land and buildings.30 PPP implementation \n \n25 The Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport and Ministry of Fisheries have committed to pilot gender-\nbased budgeting for at least two of their programs. The methodology and new budget submission templates will be \ndistributed to all ministries, and other ministries may choose to also participate in the pilot.  \n26 Air Pacific Limited (trading as Fiji Airways), Airports Fiji Limited, and Fiji Ports Corporation Limited in particular offer \nessential services in air and maritime transport for Fiji and the Pacific region. \n27 The portfolio\u2019s average return on equity for 2015\u20132018 was 9.9%, with a return on assets of 4.2%. For 2010\u20132014, \nthe average return on equity was 3.3% and the return on assets was 1.5%. \n28 Among other key features, the act (i) harmonizes different forms of SOEs under a single framework; (ii) establishes \na framework for the identification, costing, contracting, and financing of community-service obligations that applies \nto all SOEs; (iii) makes the minister for public enterprises solely responsible for SOEs, with clear duties and \nresponsibilities; and (iv) strengthens the appointment process for directors, and their duties and responsibilities. \n29 This compares to less than 25% people in such positions trained in 2017. The training was considered important to \nensure implementation of the new act and that directors and management can be held to account for performance. \nThe training was attended by 11 of the 13 women directors (85%) and all 7 women in senior management (100%).  \n30 In the COVID-19 response budget, the government announced its intention to convert government loans to equity \nfor five agriculture sector SOEs\u2014Fiji Sugar Corporation, PAFCO, Fiji Rice Limited, Food Processors (Fiji) Limited, \nand Viti Corp Company Limited\u2014to strengthen their balance sheets. \n ", "8 \nguidelines, including on the PPP procurement process, which complement the \nPPP  policy  approved  under  subprogram  2,  were  approved  by  Cabinet  and \npublished on the MOE\u2019s website.  \n \n17.  Reform area 3: Business and investment climate improved. Foreign direct investment \nin Fiji averaged 6.7% of GDP from 2010 to 2018, and is constrained by a weak investment climate \naffected by policy uncertainty and gaps in the commercial legal framework. Proactive measures \nare also required to ensure women\u2019s private sector participation, and inclusive and sustainable \neconomic development in the immediate, medium and longer term. Reforms to improve the \nbusiness and investment climate are being undertaken in consultation with the private sector. \nThese  reforms  will  stimulate  new  private  investment,  which  is  essential  as  Fiji\u2019s  economy \nrecovers. The COVID-19 response budget included targeted measures to support business \nsurvival during the downturn. These reforms are achieved through the following subprogram 3 \npolicy actions: \n(i)  Foreign investment and trade. To strengthen investor rights and streamline the \ninvestment approval process, a new Investment Bill was approved by Cabinet for \ntabling in Parliament, and the solicitor-general notified the secretary-general of \nparliament that the Investment Bill will be introduced in a regular 2020 sitting of \nParliament.31 The bill, when enacted, will replace the Foreign Investment Act 1999, \nand it builds on the policy statement approved in subprogram 2. To improve trade \ncompetitiveness, the government has completed five World Trade Organization \nTrade Facilitation Agreement commitments.32 These reforms will decrease barriers \nto international and regional trade and foreign direct investment flows.  \n(ii)  Access to finance. The Personal Property Securities Registry was established \nfollowing  the  passing  of  the  associated  act  and  implementing  regulations  in \nsubprograms 1 and 2,33 enabling lenders to more easily, cheaply, and securely \naccept movable assets as security for loans. This particularly benefits businesses \nowned by women, who are less likely to have fixed assets, such as land. \n(iii)  Ease of doing business. The Regulation of Building Permits Act 2017, which \nsimplifies construction permit applications and speeds approvals, was approved in \nsubprogram 1. It has come into force, and application forms have been streamlined \nand  harmonized,  and  an  online  portal  launched  to  provide  easier  access to \ninformation for those submitting applications. Following stakeholder consultations \nin subprogram 2, Cabinet approved bills to enhance the legal framework for \ntrademarks, designs, and patents; and the solicitor-general notified the secretary-\ngeneral of Parliament that the bills will be introduced in a regular 2020 sitting of \nParliament  (footnote  31).34  Cabinet  approved  a  competition  and  consumer \n \n31 All bills that are tabled will undergo validation and gender analysis by the parliamentary standing committee with \njurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill. \n32 These commitments are provisions that the World Trade Organization member will implement after a transitional \nperiod following the entry into force of the Trade Facilitation Agreement. The five commitments completed in \nsubprogram 3 are: Article 1.3 Enquiry Points; Article 1.4 Notification; Article 3 Advance Rulings; Article 7.7 Trade \nFacilitation Measures for Authorized Operators; and Article 10.3 Use of International Standards. The Trade \nFacilitation Agreement was ratified under subprogram 1, and four commitments were completed in subprogram 2. \n33 The Personal Property Securities Act 2017 came into force when the Registry was established and launched. This \ncompletes the reform and the framework is fully operational. As of 31 March 2020, over 57,500 filings were recorded. \nPersonal property securities reform has been completed in nine Pacific developing member countries with support \nfrom ADB, resulting in harmonization of legal frameworks.

Sydney. \n34 In May 2020, Parliament referred international treaties on intellectual property (the Madrid Agreement Concerning \nthe International Registration of Marks, the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement, and the Paris Convention for \nProtection of Industrial Property) to the Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs and Defense for review. Submissions \nwere heard in June 2020. These treaties enable international recognition of intellectual property rights among parties. \n ", "9 \nprotection policy statement, and the drafting of associated legislation, which sets \nout the government's commitments in facilitating a well-functioning competitive \nmarket economy. This follows extensive consultations on a review of the Fijian \nCompetition and Consumer Commission Act 2010 undertaken in subprogram 2.35  \n(iv)  Coronavirus disease response. To help the private sector and workers mitigate \nthe  financial  impact  of  COVID-19,  the  government  introduced,  via  the \nsupplementary  COVID-19  response  budget  for  FY2020  (i)  a  reduction  in \nemployers\u2019 statutory Fiji National Provident Fund contributions until 31 December \n2020; (ii) 21 days government-paid sick leave for workers who test positive to \nCOVID-19;  (iii)  tax  deductions  for  employers  for  wages  and  salary  paid  to \nemployees  who  are  self-quarantined;  (iv)  additional  contributions  to  financial \nsector schemes that boost lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); \nand (v) relief payments to informal sector workers, including for women-owned \nmicroenterprises such as hawkers, in lockdown areas.36 In addition, a guidance \nnote on the gendered impacts of COVID-19 in Fiji was presented to Cabinet by the \nMWCPA;  a  newly  established  government-led  COVID-19  Response  Gender \nWorking Group will oversee further analysis and implement recommendations into \nfuture COVID-19 assessments and responses.37 \n \n18.  Post-program partnership framework. Major reforms have been achieved through the \nprogram; however, continued reform is needed. The four bills approved by the Cabinet\u2014on \ninvestment, trademarks, designs, and patents\u2014will be tabled in Parliament, and upon approval \nimplemented. The Public Financial Management Bill, which was removed from subprogram 3, will \nbe finalized and tabled in Parliament. Work started in subprogram 3 to mainstream GRB will \ncontinue after learning from the pilots. Ongoing improvements to the operations of SOEs are \nanticipated, and SOEs involved in air and maritime transport will facilitate delivery of services \ncritical to post-COVID-19 economic recovery in Fiji and the Pacific region. A PFM roadmap will \nbe developed from the PEFA Assessment to clearly guide the future reform program. Details of \nthe PPPF can be found in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  Gender. Subprogram 3 is classified gender equity theme. Subprogram 3 includes policy \nactions  that  will  have  a  transformational  impact  on  gender  equality,  women\u2019s  economic \nempowerment, and women\u2019s access to resources and services. To address the immediate \nimpacts of COVID-19, actions included: (i) support for SMEs owned or led by women; (ii) direct \ncash transfers to informal workers, including for microenterprises owned by women (such as \nhawkers); and (iii) a guidance note on the gendered impacts of COVID-19 in Fiji presented to \nCabinet,  and  the  establishment  of  a  COVID-19  Gender  Working  Group  to  act  on  the \nrecommendations from the paper. To increase women\u2019s voice and access to services and \nresources, the government carried out a number of actions to introduce GRB. To ensure a gender-\nresponsive  business  and  investment  climate,  actions  included:  (i)  gender  analysis  on  the \ninvestment, trademarks, designs and patents bills by the Parliamentary Standing Committee with \njurisdiction over the subject matter of the bills; (ii) the establishment of a sex-disaggregated \nPersonal Property Securities Registry that allows women to more easily access finance; and \n \n35 In addition, the government is implementing reforms on starting a business, including digitization of its companies\u2019 \nregistry and business licensing reforms, with technical support from Singapore Cooperation Enterprise. \n36 Additional contributions were made to the Credit Guarantee Scheme and Natural Disaster Rehabilitation Facility, \nwhich makes loans available to banks at very low interest rates to pass on to SMEs impacted by COVID-19 at a \ncapped interest rate. These schemes are administered by the Reserve Bank of Fiji, and are particularly important to \nprovide finance for SMEs owned by women, which are less likely to have capital or insurance to sustain operations. \n37 The Working Group is led by MWPCA and includes representatives of civil society and women\u2019s rights organizations, \nADB and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). \n ", "10 \n(iii) a Cabinet-approved competition and consumer protection policy statement with a commitment \nto supporting women\u2019s consumer rights. These actions will expand the use of GRB in government \nprograms and ensure that future COVID-19 programs include targeted measures for women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment. Ultimately, the longer-term effect of the reforms will ensure inclusive \nprivate sector-led growth; increased access to quality services for women and girls; and women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment during and following the COVID-19 crisis.  \n \n20.  ADB engagement. ADB has supported PFM reform, SOE reform, and business climate \nreform through regional and country-specific TA projects.38 There is strong collaboration with the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand, the European Union, the IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial \nTechnical Assistance Centre, and the World Bank, and all are supporting these reforms. ADB\u2019s \nstrong relationship with the government enabled ADB to help identify and implement critical \nstructural reforms. Specifically, ADB has directly supported the introduction of GRB; the drafting \nof  policy  or  legislation on  SOEs,  PPPs,  personal  property  securities, and  competition  and \nconsumer protection; and has provided implementation support. ADB supported the drafting of a \nguidance note on the gendered impacts of COVID-19 in Fiji, and ADB is a member of the \ngovernment\u2019s COVID-19 Gender Working Group. The programmatic approach has enabled the \nsequencing of complex reforms, with ADB TA involvement across all reform areas in support of \nall subprograms, aligned with development partners.   \n \n21.  Lessons from ADB\u2019s engagement in these areas in Fiji and across the Pacific, including \nfrom  implementing  subprograms  1  and  2,  highlight  the  need  to:  (i)  identify  champions  to \nstrengthen reform commitment and lead implementation; (ii) obtain broad endorsement so that \nreforms  are  not  derailed  if  leadership  changes;  (iii)  pursue  moderate,  sequenced  reforms, \nespecially if institutional capacity is limited; (iv) provide sufficient time to develop capacity and \ninstitutionalize reforms; (v) meet with government specialists responsible for undertaking specific \nreforms (in addition to senior officials) to ensure appropriate technical input; (vi) create clear \ntracking tools to monitor progress toward final outcomes; and (vii) showcase the impact of reforms \nto other countries in the Pacific region, such as through regional fora or knowledge products, to \nencourage harmonization of reform in the region.39 \n \n22.  Development partner coordination. The program is part of a multi-development partner \npackage of support for structural reform. The governments of Australia and New Zealand will \nprovide grants, and AIIB will provide a loan in 2020 linked to the completion of the ADB policy \nactions. The World Bank is preparing a new development policy operation series for approval in \nlate 2020. Joint missions have been undertaken to develop subprogram 3 with cofinanciers, and \nregular development partner meetings are held to coordinate reforms (para. 20). \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n23.  Implementation of the policy actions for the overall reform program will improve the quality \nof budget systems and institutions; improve the productivity and competitiveness of SOEs; and \nhelp create new businesses and formal job growth, including for women.40 It will also mitigate the \nimpact of COVID-19 on businesses, workers, the poor and vulnerable through targeted transfers. \nThe GRB actions will increase awareness of the cost of gender inequality; increase capacity and \ndata related to gender equality; increase budget transparency, accountability and participation; \n \n38 ADB.

GRB actions will also \nhave impacts across the region as lessons will inform GRB initiatives in other Pacific countries. \nImproving the policy, legal, and institutional framework for SOEs will strengthen governance, \ntransparency, and accountability; improve performance and service delivery; reduce contingent \nliabilities;  create  room  for  private  investment;  and  improve  the  reliability,  efficiency,  and \naffordability of public services. Fiji\u2019s business environment reforms are expected to increase its \nease of doing business score from 61.5 in 2019 to at least 64.0 by 2020, which would bring Fiji\u2019s \nperformance above that of the Philippines (62.8) and close to that of Malta (66.1) in 2019.41  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n24.  The government has requested a regular loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 3.42 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n25.  The subprogram 3 financing will help meet the government\u2019s total financing requirements \nfor FY2020\u2014 projected at $580 million, including the COVID-19 response budget\u2014and FY2021. \nIn FY2020, the external financing need is $268 million, of which ADB will finance 74.8% and \ncofinancing partners will finance 19.5% as part of the program. Parallel collaborative partner \ncofinancing includes a loan of $50 million from AIIB, a grant of $1.5 million (NZ$2.5 million) from \nthe  Government  of  New  Zealand,  and  a  grant  of  $0.7  million  (AU$1.0  million)  from  the \nGovernment  of  Australia.43  The  gap  will  be  filled  by  grants  and  concessional  loans  from \ndevelopment partners and domestic bonds. Additional funding (of over $9.1 million) has been \nprovided  by  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand  to  assist  with  the  COVID-19 \nresponse. The program has considered the government\u2019s financing needs, its ability to rebuild \nfiscal buffers to respond to disasters triggered by natural hazards, the availability of alternative \nfinancing and estimated financial support from other partners, and debt sustainability. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The implementation period for subprogram 3 is May 2019\u2013October 2020. The preparation \nand completion of policy actions for subprogram 3 was carried out from May 2019 to June 2020. \nThe MOE was the executing agency for all three subprograms. The MOE has taken the lead in \ncoordinating implementation of actions; engaging in progress meetings with the Ministry of \nCommerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport; the MWCPA; and the Reserve Bank of Fiji as \nimplementing agencies, and providing updates to ADB. The MOE has also actively coordinated \npolicy dialogue and needed technical support for the program reforms with partners (para. 20). \nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).44 \n \n \n41 The World Bank. Doing Business. Reforms under the program are expected to improve scores for the following Doing \nBusiness topics: (i) getting credit (personal property securities reform); (ii) trading across borders (Word Trade \nOrganization Trade Facilitation Agreement implementation); and (iii) dealing with construction permits (building \npermits reform). \n42 Subprogram 3 was originally planned as a $100 million program, following the outbreak of COVID-19 the government \nrequested an additional $100 million to reflect revised forecasts of financing needs. \n43 The Government of Australia and AIIB are new cofinancing partners. \n44 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram 3 is classified category \nC for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will \nbe confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n28.  Risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.45 PFM systems are assessed as capable \nof supporting reliable service provision. Policy reforms and TA support will address other fiduciary \nrisks. The overall risk of the operation is moderate.  \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe COVID-19 pandemic undermines  ADB will monitor national and global economic developments and \neconomic growth and Fiji\u2019s fiscal position to  respond in a timely manner and in coordination with other partners to \nthe point that it diverts political and  possible  government  requests  for  assistance  if  the  economic \nadministrative focus and capacity away from  downturn becomes more severe than anticipated. \nreforms. \nPolicy reform implementation falters because  Reforms  are  prioritized  and  sequenced,  taking  into  account \nof inadequate institutional capacity.  institutional capacity.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government; the MOE; the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport; the \nMWCPA; and the Reserve Bank of Fiji.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n30.  The government and the MOE have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 3 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anti-corruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that government \nhas completed the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the subprogram. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n31.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $200,000,000 to the Republic of Fiji for subprogram 3 of the Sustained Private Sector-Led \nGrowth Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n       Masatsugu Asakawa \n2 July 2020       President \n \n45 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  13 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nInclusive socioeconomic development achieved (National Development Plan 2017\u20132036)a \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with Targets  Reporting \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the  By 2021:     \nReform  a.
