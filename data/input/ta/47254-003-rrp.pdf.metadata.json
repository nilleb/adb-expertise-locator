THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka Water Supply Network Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will improve the water supply system in the country\u2019s capital, Dhaka, \nby making it more reliable, sustainable, and climate-resilient. It will consolidate and enhance the \ngains made in the efficiency of the water distribution network achieved under two ongoing Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) projects, and improve the service delivery and the capacity of the \nDhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA).2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Enhancing  distribution  network  efficiency  gains.  The  development  of  urban \ninfrastructure  has  not  kept  pace  with  rapid  urbanization  in  Bangladesh.  Providing  sufficient \ndrinking water to meet growing demand in Dhaka has been particularly challenging due to the \ncity\u2019s average annual population growth rate of 3.6% since 2005, which has far exceeded the \n1.1% national average.3 DWASA is the public utility responsible for providing Dhaka\u2019s 13.5 million \npeople  with  water.4 Support  for  its  efforts  to  improve  its  distribution  network  has  included \nfinancing under the two earlier ADB projects: (i) the Dhaka Water Supply Sector Development \nProgram, which was approved in 2007 to rehabilitate DWASA\u2019s supply systems and build up its \ninstitutional  capacity;  and  (ii)  the  Dhaka  Environmentally  Sustainable  Water  Supply  Project, \napproved in 2013 with the aim of augmenting the surface water sources for the supply system \nand improving parts of the distribution network (footnote 2). \n \n4.  Both projects are ongoing. They have improved the water distribution networks to deliver \nquality service for 7 million people by establishing district metered areas (DMAs) and working to \nreduce the ratio of nonrevenue water (NRW) in the system in each DMA.5 Unlike before, the \npiped water supply in the DMAs commissioned so far is now available 24 hours a day.  Physical \nwater losses from these systems have been cut from 40% to less than 15%.6 Good quality \npotable water from system taps is now assured. The 2007 program has provided authorized \naccess to piped water to 154,000 people in 15 low-income communities (LICs). Based on the \nsuccess under these projects, DWASA is now committed to providing authorized connections in \nall LICs in Dhaka. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  (i) ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Dhaka  Water  Supply  Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (Loans 2382-BAN [project loan] and 2383-BAN [program loan]); and (ii) ADB. 2013. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Administration of Loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka Environmentally Sustainable Water Supply Project. Manila \n(Loan 3051-BAN). ADB funded  the preparation of the proposed project with support from the Netherlands Trust \nFund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility. \n3  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. 2015. World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision. \nNew York. \n4  DWASA is a public sector autonomous commercial organization, entrusted with the responsibility for providing water \nsupply, sewage disposal, and storm water drainage services to Dhaka City. \n5  NRW is equal to the total amount of the system input volume minus the total amount of the authorized consumption. \nDMAs are areas that are hydraulically isolated from the bulk water transmission mains and  the rest of the \nneighboring areas. The use of the DMA-based approach helps in proper management of water leakage, water \npressure, and water balance. \n6  Physical losses in 30 commissioned DMAs range from 1.58% to 14.06% and the current average is 4.95%, \naccording to DWASA estimates. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  DWASA still has challenges. It needs to expand efficiency gains throughout its service \narea. It must reduce overall physical losses and the estimated 26% overall NRW ratio in its \nsystem operations. In areas not covered by the ongoing projects where 6.5 million people reside, \nwater losses are still the main reason for poor service delivery. Reducing these losses will \nincrease the amount of water available to residents, which will reduce household use of illegal \nsuction pumps to withdraw water from distribution lines, and underground storage reservoirs. This, \nin turn, will improve the quality and reliability of the water consumed in the city, ease water-\nrelated public health risks, cut down the consumption of energy used to pump water, and help \nmake clean water more accessible generally and in LICs. If accompanied by the setting of \nappropriate water tariffs, reducing NRW will also ensure DWASA\u2019s financial sustainability. In \naddition, DWASA needs additional financing to complete some of the civil works of DMAs under \nongoing contracts of the 2007 program.7 \n \n6.  Increasing climate change resilience. Climate change is likely to exacerbate the threats \nto Dhaka\u2019s already vulnerable water security. The decline in water availability due to altered \nprecipitation patterns and increased evapotranspiration caused by higher temperatures, and the \nrising incidence of water pollution from flooding are major climate risks. A rise in the number of \nweather events that could disrupt water supply service is a secondary projected risk, along with \nrising sea levels that could increase the salinization of both groundwater and surface water.8 \n \n7.  The use of the DMA-based approach reduces the city\u2019s vulnerability to water shortages by \nmaking more water available through efficient water management systems. DWASA also needs \nto adapt to future climate change effects by enhancing its institutional abilities in the sustainable \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of DMA systems. In addition, it must be able to monitor water \nquality to detect and mitigate water pollution and salinization. A program to make the public \naware of the need to conserve water will be necessary to prepare the city to withstand adverse \nclimate events. Improving access to piped water in LICs will increase the resilience of the poor in \nthe face of climate change and the risk of natural disasters. \n \n8.  Sustainable  management  of  district  metered  areas.  DWASA  is  committed  to \ninstitutional  reforms  to  ensure  sustainable  service  delivery.  Under  a  partnership  framework \nbetween the government and development partners supported by the 2007 program, DWASA \nhas increased its drinking water tariff by 5% annually since 2007. It has implemented a capacity-\nbuilding program for more than 2,200 staff members in such areas as financial management and \nO&M. It also reduced the number of staff per 1,000 connections from 17 in 2007 to 9 in 2013. \n                                                \n7  DMA improvement under the 2007 program includes the rehabilitation of 1,536 kilometers of distribution network pipe \nand 157,000 service connections. The additional funds ($36.89 million [ADB\u2019s financing portion]) are required to \ncover the cost overruns resulting from changes in the SDR\u2013$ exchange rate, an increase after detailed designs and \nphysical verification of the existing distribution networks in the quantity of works and goods required, and price \nescalation. ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria for additional financing have been met. The 2007 program remains technically \nfeasible, economically viable, and financially sound even after taking the additional financing into consideration. It \naligns with the government policy and the current country partnership strategy. With additional financing, the program \nwill be completed by the end of 2017, compared with the current targeted closing date of 30 June 2016. The 2007 \nprogram is performing well in terms of delivering expected outputs, and its implementation progress has been \nsatisfactory. Out of the net loan amount ($139.7 million), the cumulative contract awards total $138.7 million, or \n99.3%, and the disbursements are $126.4 million, or 90.5%, as of the end of March 2016. Performance on \ncompliance with safeguard policy requirements has been satisfactory. Risks have successfully been managed, and \nthe project has an on track rating. The project performance on these criteria was good for the 12 months before \ninterdepartmental review, and the design and implementation problems have been fully and satisfactorily addressed. \nMore details are provided in the Summary of Additional Financing Part (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n8  Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management Reporting (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "3 \nDWASA developed a 5-year corporate business plan in 2010 and updates it regularly.9 It has \nbeen carrying out a turnaround program since 2010 to build its institutional abilities, promote \ntransparency, and improve operational efficiency and customer services. These activities have \ncontributed to full O&M cost recovery and better debt servicing of DWASA. Its net profit was \nTk111 million in FY2014, compared with loss of Tk670 million in FY2008.10 \n \n9.  Managing DMAs professionally and sustaining the newly achieved low levels of NRW \nratios are both critical to keeping DWASA\u2019s operations sustainable. This is also important to \nmeeting Dhaka\u2019s growing demand for water, which is projected to rise from 2,144 million liters per \nday (MLD) in 2015 to 2,616 MLD in 2020. DWASA has plans to enhance its capacity to produce \nwater from various sources to 3,306 MLD by 2020 from 2,420 MLD in 2014, mainly by developing \nsurface water sources. This will include the 500 MLD augmentation to be achieved under ADB\u2019s \nDhaka Environmentally Sustainable Water Supply Project (footnote 2). Another water treatment \nplant (Saidabad Water Treatment Plant III) is also planned by DWASA. However, these will not \nmeet projected needs unless current water losses are substantially reduced. Water supply deficits \nmay arise after 2020, and efficiency gains will be needed to deal with them.11 \n \n10.  To sustain its efficiency gains, DWASA\u2019s capacity to carry out O&M in the DMAs must be \nimproved,  since  a  growing  number  of  DMAs  will  be  commissioned  and  handed  over  by \ncontractors  to  DWASA  operational  staff  under  the  ongoing  projects.  DWASA  needs  to \ninstitutionalize the DMA-based approach by updating operating procedures, training and orienting \noperations staff in DMA management, and developing a comprehensive DMA management plan. \nThe  project  will  help  DWASA  make  the  necessary  institutional  transformation  into  a  highly \nefficient and financially sound water utility. \n \n11.  Lessons. Lessons and findings from previous ADB water sector operations highlight a \nstrong need to ensure efficiency gains by reducing NRW ratios before expanding a system\u2019s \nwater supply.12 This project is in line with these recommendations. It will support the ongoing \nefforts of DWASA to improve its existing distribution networks alongside the augmentation of the \nsystem\u2019s  water  sources  and  the  maximization  of  service  delivery  benefits.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan and its country partnership strategy for Bangladesh \nfor 2011\u20132015.13  \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The impacts will be (i) safe drinking water made available for all of Bangladesh\u2019s urban \npopulations, aligned  with the government\u2019s five-year plan for FY2016\u2013FY2020;14 and (ii) adaptive \ncapacity of water sector enhanced for reducing climate change vulnerability, aligned with the \nnational strategy for water supply and sanitation.15 The outcome will be sustainable provision of a \nmore reliable, improved, and climate-resilient water supply in Dhaka City. \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Outputs \n13.  The  outputs  will  be  DWASA\u2019s  (i)  distribution  network  strengthened,  (ii)  sustainable \nmanagerial capacity of DMA enhanced, and (iii) capacity for quality service delivery enhanced. \nThe major value additions of the project to improve efficiency, quality, and resiliency of drinking \nwater  distribution  include  expanding  DMAs,  introducing  technology  for  DMA  management \nincluding a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, building DWASA\u2019s capacity \nto improve its finances and sustain the O&M in the DMAs, and engaging with civil society. The \nproject will facilitate regular policy dialogue among stakeholders to improve DWASA's regulatory \nand tariff structure. \n \n14.  Output 1: Distribution network strengthened. Building on the ongoing work of two \nADB-financed projects, the project will help improve the distribution network in Dhaka City.16 It will \nfinance the improvements (i) in new DMAs not financed by the ongoing loans,17 and (ii) in DMAs \nunder the 2007 program through additional financing to meet cost overruns and complete civil \nworks under ongoing contracts (footnote 7). The project will extend new or regularized water \nconnections to LICs where people are relying on illegal water lines or private water vendors and \npaying higher charges than they will when they use the expanded systems. \n \n15.  Output  2:  Sustainable  managerial  capacity  of  district  metered  areas  enhanced. \nDWASA\u2019s managerial and technical capacity will be strengthened to keep NRW at a low level. \nThe project will assist DWASA in (i) preparing and implementing a sustainable NRW reduction \nplan;18 (ii) strengthening monitoring capacity at the zone level with renewed standard operating \nprocedures,19 upgraded training modules and SCADA system, and the piloting of automated \nmeter reading; and (iii) enhancing in-house design capacity for sustainable DMA management. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Capacity  for  quality  service  delivery  enhanced.  The  project  will  help \nDWASA (i) prepare and implement an operational and financial improvement plan by enhancing \nthe existing 5-year corporate business plan;20 (ii) build capacity for planning, design, construction \nsupervision, and project management; (iii) prepare and implement a plan to make the public more \naware of demand control, water conservation, and health and hygiene; (iv) make the quality of the \nservice delivery to LICs better; (v) prepare and implement a water quality monitoring system; (vi) \nimplement a gender action plan; and (vii) enhance project readiness for future investment.21 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $408 million (Table 1). \n \n                                                \n16 Under the two ADB-financed projects, DWASA has been strengthening the existing water supply network by \nestablishing DMAs in 3 of its 10 zones (5, 6, and 8) and parts of 4 zones (3, 4, 9, and 10) that serve 7 million people.  \n17 The project will cover the new DMAs of 3 zones (1, 2, and 7) and the remaining parts of 4 zones (3, 4, 9, and 10) that \nserve 6.5 million people. It will rehabilitate 1,500 kilometers of distribution network pipe; and rehabilitate, build, or \nregularize 234,000 connections. \n18 The sustainable NRW reduction plan will include the targets for NRW reduction; optimal DMA-based organizational \nstructure; an incentive mechanism to improve operations; and an asset management plan, budget requirements, and \na training plan. \n19 Standard operating procedures will include water loss assessment, water balance calculation, leak management, \nasset management, and smart water management technologies.  \n20 The existing 5-year corporate business plan comprises subplans. These include an investment plan, a financial plan, \na tariff plan, and a human resource development plan. In addition, the project will prepare a sustainable NRW \nreduction plan, a water quality monitoring plan, and a demand management plan. \n21 DWASA will engage consultants to prepare future projects, mainly involving sewerage management. \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Technical  \n22.  The project will establish DMAs (footnote 5). The technical ability of the DMA-based \napproach  to  reduce  water  losses  has  been  demonstrated  by  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  projects.  The \napproach will help strengthen the climate resilience of these water supply systems by making \nmore water available. DWASA has gained experience in installing a SCADA system in piloted \nDMAs. These have shown the advantages of centralized supervision and control of water flow \nand water pressure. The project will assist DWASA in realizing the full-scale operational capacity \nof the SCADA system. Trenchless technology will be used in rehabilitating existing pipes. This will \n                                                                                                                                                          \nmillion) will be confirmed once approved by the respective institutions. The Saidabad Water Treatment Plant III will \ncomplement the project\u2019s distribution network improvement to deliver more reliable services. \n24 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nconsiderably reduce the need to open up the roads and pavements and thus reduce traffic flow \ndisruptions.  It  will  also  mitigate  the  resettlement  impacts.  To  ensure  quality  civil  works, \ncontractors will be required to meet functional guarantees, such as a minimum of sustained \nnetwork pressure (1 bar or greater at all times) and a cap on physical losses (below 10% of \nsupplied volume in each DMA). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Economic analysis. The major benefits of the project will be the provision of an improved \nand  more  reliable  water  supply  to  a  growing  population  in  project  service  areas\u2014including \nincremental  water  supply;  savings  for  customers  who  will  no  longer  need  to  incur  water \npurification costs; savings for consumers who will no longer have to pay higher prices to buy \nwater from vendors; savings in the energy costs of households that will no longer need to use \nelectricity to employ suction pumps to withdraw water; and savings in health-related expenditures \ndue to an expected reduction of waterborne diseases. The estimated economic internal rate of \nreturn is 15.4% for new DMAs to be developed under the project.25 The sensitivity analysis shows \nthat the project is viable under adverse conditions.\n \n \n24.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis found the project to be financially viable, with \nthe internal rate of return for new DMAs estimated at 1.4%.26 Sensitivity analysis showed this \nreturn, which exceeds the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 0.24%, to be robust \nunder  several  adverse  scenarios.  Analysis  of  DWASA\u2019s  financial  position  revealed  that  the \ncurrent annual 5% tariff increase would not be enough over the medium and long terms to fully \ncover O&M costs and service loans due to an increased number of development partner-funded \nprojects. The government must ensure that DWASA meets the appropriate debt service coverage \nratio of more than 1.0 and an operating ratio of less than 100% for it to remain financially \nsustainable. This needs to be done by the higher tariff adjustment or other means. To help the \ngovernment and DWASA achieve this financial sustainability, ADB will provide policy advice and \ncapacity development support and help develop an updated tariff adjustment plan. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Financial management. A financial management assessment concluded that DWASA is \ncapable of undertaking the financial management of ADB-financed projects. DWASA has prior \nand  ongoing  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects  and  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  financial \naccounting methods and disbursement procedures for such projects. The overall risk assessment \nfor the project is moderate. The risk mitigation measures include (i) strengthening DWASA\u2019s \ninternal audit unit to conduct timely audits, and (ii) implementing an integrated financial data \nsystem  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  reporting  and  monitoring.  This  project  will  modernize \naccounting, billing and collection, and audit systems for enhancing the financial management of \nDWASA. \n \n26.  Procurement.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). National competitive bidding will follow the \ngovernment\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act,  2006  and  Public  Procurement  Rules,  2008,  with \nmodifications and/or clarifications agreed between DWASA and ADB. A project procurement \ncapacity assessment concluded that DWASA is capable of carrying out the procurement for ADB-\nfinanced projects. It has prior and ongoing experience in implementing these projects and is \n                                                \n25 The economic internal rate of return of the 2007 program with additional financing is 16%. \n26 The financial internal rate of return of the 2007 program with additional financing is 1.5%, which is higher than the \nweighted average cost of capital of 1.43%. \n ", "8 \nfamiliar  with  ADB's  procurement  procedures.  The  overall  risk  assessment for  the  project  is \nmoderate,  and  the  risk  mitigation  measures  against  the  implementation  delays  include  (i) \nproviding  training  to  and  sharing  knowledge  with  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  to \nstrengthen  its  ability  to  process  procurement  efficiently,  and  (ii)  preparing  the  master  bid \ndocuments  for  works  and  consulting  services  to  expedite  advance  action.  A  procurement \nspecialist from the design, management, and supervision (DMS) consultants will help the PMU \nprepare and evaluate bids.  \n \n27.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  DWASA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures related to preventing corruption are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \nIn October 2012, the government approved a national integrity strategy and formed a national \nintegrity advisory committee to implement the strategy and oversee anticorruption activities. It is \nchaired by the prime minister. The strategy includes a road map for strengthening both state and \nnonstate accountability institutions to fight corruption and improve governance. The constitutional \nanticorruption agency is the Anti-Corruption Commission, which is empowered to investigate any \nirregularities  in  the  project.  The  PMU  will  follow  government  rules  and  procedures  for  all \nexpenses and revenue items. DWASA will establish a project website for transparency and a \nsystem for handling complaints related to contracts and procurement.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Access to a water supply in Dhaka City is mainly through household pipe connections and \npublic taps. People living in LICs generally do not have legal access to these water supplies or to \nsanitation services because they often live unauthorized on lands to which they have no legal \ntitle. They depend on illegal water lines or private vendors, and pay higher charges than they \nwould for a legal supply. With assistance from nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the project \nwill  help  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  make  poor  households  in  LICs,  including \nhouseholds headed by women, eligible for legal water connections either by legalizing existing \nillegal connections or setting up new ones. This will enable the poor to receive metered water for \nless  than  what  they  now  pay.  The  CBOs  will  be  responsible  for  paying  water  tariffs  and \nmaintaining the community water points. Campaign activities will be carried out to enhance public \nawareness on water conservation and public hygiene. Capacity development in the communities \nwill contribute to making the project benefits sustainable. \n \n29.  Gender. The expansion of the piped water supply network under the project will benefit \nwomen  by  reducing  the  time  and  effort  now  needed  for  them  to  obtain  water  for  their \nhouseholds.27 Women will be able to actively participate and voice their views in decision-making \non water supply matters through the CBOs. A gender action plan has been prepared.28 Focused \nand  efficient  community  campaigns  will  make  women  aware  of  the  need  to  use  water \neconomically. Women will have equal opportunity with men to participate in project-supported \ntraining programs, recruitment, and employment in construction. Core labor standards, including \nequal wages for women and men for work of equal value, will be ensured. Resources have been \nallocated for the implementation and monitoring of the gender action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The PAM outlines the detailed implementation arrangements for safeguards. DWASA has \nthe capacity to implement safeguards based on its experience in the ongoing ADB-financed \n                                                \n27 The project will benefit approximately 150,000 women from LICs. \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nprojects.29 The PMU will have a safeguard implementation unit staffed by an environment officer, \na social officer, and a gender officer. The unit will be assisted by safeguard specialists of the \nDMS consultant team and NGOs. \n \n31.  Environmental safeguard. The project is classified as category B for environment per \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). No significant environmental impacts are anticipated. \nAll the project sites visited by the project team are located outside sensitive areas, and adverse \nimpacts from construction or operations can be avoided and/or mitigated through proper design, \nhigh-quality  construction,  and  good  O&M  practices.  The  drafts  of  five  initial  environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) with related environmental management plans have already been prepared \nand disclosed on the DWASA and ADB websites.30 All bid documents and contracts of civil works \npackages will contain IEEs, and all IEEs will be submitted to ADB for review, no objection, and \ndisclosure prior to the issuance of bidding documents. DWASA will obtain the necessary statutory \nclearances and permits from the Department of Environment prior to the award of project-related \ncivil works contracts. DWASA will make use of its prior experience from the ongoing ADB projects \nin environmental management and will be supported by the DMS consultant team. Consultation \nand public participation will continue throughout project implementation, and any environmental \ngrievances will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism developed for \nthe project. Environmental reporting to ADB will be done on a semiannual basis. \n \n32.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. All the affected people are making informal use of government land or right-of-way \nto live or run their business. No private land acquisition will be required. The project will have \nimpacts on the semipermanent structures and livelihoods of 259 vendors or hawkers during \nconstruction, but the effects will be temporary and those affected will be able to return to their \noriginal sites after construction is completed. The project will also temporarily impact the daily \nwages of 84 workers. The semipermanent structures of two households will be impacted, and one \nhousehold will need to be relocated. Five draft resettlement plans were prepared to mitigate the \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  related  to  each  civil  works  package  and  disclosed  on  the \nDWASA and ADB websites.31 The plans were prepared based on an impact assessment in \nsample  project  sites  and  will  be  updated  during  the  detailed  engineering  design.  Public \nconsultations and focus group meetings have been held at each project site. Consultations will be \ncontinued  with  communities  throughout  implementation.  DWASA  has  experience  from  the \nongoing  ADB  projects  in  implementing  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policy  and  requirements.  An  NGO \nexperienced  in  land  acquisition and resettlement  activities  will  be  engaged  to  help  DWASA \nfinalize and implement the resettlement plan. \n \n33.  Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  has  been  designated  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples. No communities of indigenous people were found at the project sites. \n   \n                                                \n29 The compliance with safeguards has been satisfactory in the ongoing ADB projects, and risks have been managed \nadequately. No major environmental  and social safeguard issues are identified during the implementation of \nenvironmental management plans and resettlement plans. \n30 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.
