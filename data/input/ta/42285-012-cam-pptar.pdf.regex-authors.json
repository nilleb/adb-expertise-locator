The Government of Cambodia has identified the proposed project components to be \ncovered under the ensuing loan project. It is required to conduct a project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA) and develop a project suitable for ADB funding in terms of technical, financial, \neconomic, institutional, sector policy, legal, and safeguard contexts, in conjunction with the \ncountry partnership strategy, operational experience, and lessons from evaluations of previous \nprojects. In the case of Battambang, project components covered under a pre-feasibility study of \nthe Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA) may be considered for funding under this \nproject. This project will promote economic ties with the rural hinterland of the Tonle Sap Basin \nand create synergies between other ADB interventions in agriculture, natural resources, roads \nand rural water supply.1 \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The ensuing investment project will comprise the following subsectors: (i) flood control and \nriverbank protection; (ii) solid waste management; (iii) sanitation and waste water treatment; and \n(iv) institutional capacity strengthening. Selection of prioritized subsectors (on average one to two \nsubsectors per city or town) and their details will be determined during the TA. The institutional \ncapacity strengthening component will help (i) increase efficiency and management capacity of \nthe  relevant  local  government  agencies;  and  (ii)  raise  public  awareness  on  environmental \nprotection. \n \n3.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will develop strategic urban \ndevelopment plans that will guide the future urban growth. The second phase will determine the \nfeasibility of the proposed investments for priority infrastructure construction and improvement \ncovering (i) preliminary engineering designs; (ii) cost estimates and financing plan; (iii) financial \nand economic viability and sustainability; (iv) environmental and social soundness, and detailed \nimplementation arrangements; and (v) prepare an institutional capacity strengthening program. \nThe  TA  will  also  prepare  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  that  includes  all  the \ninformation and schedules describing project implementation.
