THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Meghalaya Power Distribution Sector Improvement Project. The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR) for the Meghalaya Power Distribution Sector Improvement Project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The proposed project will strengthen and modernize the power distribution network, \nreduce technical and commercial losses, and improve the power quality of the distribution network \nin Meghalaya State. The project will enhance the institutional capacity of Meghalaya Power \nDistribution Corporation Limited (MePDCL) by (i) supporting the preparation of a distribution \nsector road map and financial road map to improve MePDCL\u2019s planning capability, and financial \nperformance and sustainability; (ii) introducing innovative components in project design; and (iii) \nbuilding MePDCL\u2019s capacity to monitor project implementation, including the environmental and \nsocial impacts of projects. The project will also support pilot testing of gender and socially inclusive \nrenewable mini grid energy systems, which have the potential for future replication. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.   The state economy. Meghalaya is a state in northeastern India with a population of about \n3 million that shares its border on the north and east with the state of Assam, and on the south \nand west with Bangladesh. Meghalaya has the highest rainfall in India, recording an annual \naverage of 12,000 millimeters. About 70% of the state is covered with forest. Meghalaya has \nsome of the densest tropical rainforests in the country, and therefore constitutes one of the most \nimportant ecotourism destinations in India. Meghalaya\u2019s economy is predominantly agrarian and \nhas a significant commercial forestry-based industry. The state has abundant natural resources, \nincluding mineral deposits (such as coal, limestone, granite, and clay), and offers significant \nopportunities for investment. In fiscal year (FY) 2019, the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, \nmining, and quarrying) contributed 25.92% of gross state domestic product; the secondary sector \n(hydropower, agro-based and food processing, chemicals, and allied industries) contributed \n16.83%; and the tertiary sector, which is the fastest-growing sector, driven by trade, hotels, real \nestate,  finance,  insurance,  transport,  communication,  and  other  services,  contributed  the \nremaining 57.25%.1 Despite its rich resource endowments and tourism potential, industry in the \nstate continues to lag behind other states because of its poor infrastructure facilities. With an \naverage annual per capita income of \u20b990,213, Meghalaya is one of the poorest states in the country \nand in the northeastern region.2 Meghalaya is also one of the few states in India that, despite having \nsurplus availability, have low per capita electricity consumption of 832 kilowatt-hours (kWh) against \nthe national average of 1,122 kWh in 2017.3 \n \n4.  Power sector overview. Under the Meghalaya Power Sector Reforms Transfer Scheme \n2010, the state government unbundled the Meghalaya State Electricity Board into four separate \ncompanies along with their physical assets, properties, liabilities, obligations, and staff. The four \nsuccessor  companies  are (i)  Meghalaya  Energy  Corporation  Limited (MeECL), the  holding \n \n1  India Brand Equity Foundation. 2019. Meghalaya: Abode of Clouds. Delhi. \n2  Statistics Times. 2019. Indian States by GDP per Capita. According to 2017\u20132018 data, only five states\u2014Assam, \nBihar, Jharkhand, Manipur, and Uttar Pradesh\u2014have lower per capita incomes than Meghalaya. \n3  EnergySector.in. State-wise per Capita Consumption of Electricity in India.  \n ", "2 \ncompany;  (ii)  Meghalaya  Power  Generation  Corporation  Limited,  the  generation  utility;  (iii) \nMeghalaya Power Transmission Corporation Limited, the transmission utility; and (iv) Meghalaya \nPower Distribution Corporation Limited (MePDCL), the distribution utility. Although the companies \nwere officially unbundled, the lack of independent finance and administrative functions, together \nwith  poor  financial  management  and  planning  capacity  of  subsidiaries,  hinders  them  from \nprogressing towards financial sustainability. \n \n5.  Meghalaya had a total installed generating capacity of 613 megawatts (MW) in June 2018, \nof which 426 MW was generated from hydropower (355 MW4 owned by the state utility and 71 \nMW from the central allocation), and the remaining 187 MW was from thermal-based generation \ncapacity from the central government allocation to Meghalaya State.5 Meghalaya draws upon this \ncentral allocation to meet winter season deficits due to low generation from its hydropower plants. \nPeak demand in FY2017 reached 399 MW and is expected to reach 470 MW in FY2021. \nAdditional generation capacity is required to achieve Meghalaya\u2019s 24X7 Power for All initiative, \nwhich aims to bring an uninterrupted supply to each consumer in the state, even under the normal \nload-growth scenario.6 Meghalaya has surplus generation capacity during summer because of high \nhydropower availability and low demand, but it experiences a capacity deficit in winter because of \nhigh demand and low hydropower availability. \n \n6.  Power distribution issues. Although Meghalaya achieved 100% electrification for rural \nand urban households (635,802 consumers) in February 2019, the voltage at consumer premises \ndrops below the allowable limit of 6% of the rated voltage during peak load periods. Further, power \ninterruptions of more than 6 hours per day are common in remote rural networks. The average \naggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses of the distribution network in 2017 were \n32.65%.7 AT&C losses attributable to three of the six circles of the Meghalaya distribution network \n(Central, East Garo Hills, and West Garo Hills) are estimated to be more than 50%. Further, the \nexisting distribution network is overloaded. Most of the 33/11 kilovolt (kV) substations in rural \nareas have outdated technology and lack control rooms, making it difficult to operate the system, \nparticularly during heavy rains and mist that are prevalent year-round in many parts of the state. \nMePDCL\u2019s billing efficiency is only 67.35% as about 75% of the consumer meters installed by \nMePDCL are outdated, resulting in high commercial losses. High AT&C losses, aged distribution \nassets, and subsidized tariffs for the poor and agricultural consumers are the major reasons for \nthe below-cost revenue recovery that has led to the poor financial state of the distribution utility. \nThe huge capital requirements to develop the aged infrastructure, and the subsidized tariff in rural \nareas make rural electrification less attractive to the private sector. The proposed project will \nimprove the reliability of distribution network, reduce AT&C losses, and improve financial viability \nand sustainability of MePDCL which may enable private sector participation and competition in \nthe state\u2019s retail distribution business in the future. \n \n7.  Government programs for the distribution sector. 24X7 Power for All Meghalaya was \na joint initiative of the Government of India and the state government of Meghalaya to provide an \nuninterrupted,  quality,  reliable,  and  affordable  power  supply  to  all  domestic,  commercial, \nagricultural, and industrial consumers (footnote 6). MePDCL also signed an agreement with the \nMinistry of Power and the state government of Meghalaya under the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance \n \n4  Approximately 90% of hydropower plants are run of the river types without storage and hence depend heavily on \nimports during winter and low monsoon periods.   \n5  Data were obtained from Meghalaya State Load Dispatch Centre in June 2018 during project preparation. \n6  Government of India and Government of Meghalaya. 2015. 24X7 Power for All Meghalaya. Delhi.  \n7  The AT&C losses and billing efficiency data are from a detailed project report prepared by MePDCL. \n ", "3 \nYojana (UDAY)8 scheme to reduce its AT&C losses from 34.76% in FY2015 to 15.00% by \nFY2020. This was to be achieved through various central government supported schemes, such \nas (i) the Integrated Power Development Scheme;9 (ii) Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti \nYojna;10 and (iii) Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya).11 Although Meghalaya \nachieved 100% electrification through the Saubhagya scheme, the state was not able to achieve \nthe envisaged loss reduction target of 15% and the AT&C losses were at 34.8% in FY 2019. The \nimplementation of identified measures for AT&C loss reduction are progressing slowly because \nof lack of sufficient funds. The project will help MePDCL implement some of these measures, \nsuch as metering, network strengthening, and billing efficiency improvement to reduce the AT&C \nlosses.  \n \n8.  Impact  of  coronavirus  disease.  The  global  pandemic  resulting  from  the  novel \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has significantly impacted the country\u2019s economy. The energy \nsector has not been spared, with the finances of state utilities detrimentally affected by reduced \ndemand from remunerative industrial and commercial consumers. The real toll of the pandemic, \nhowever, is much higher, with livelihoods affected by the shutdown of tourism in the state. The \nelectricity distribution works proposed in the project are essential activities to improve access to \nelectricity in rural areas. These will also create construction-related jobs for the local community, \nincluding returning migrant workers who lost jobs, which will remain valid in a post COVID-19 \nrecovery phase. \n \n9.  Alignment with ADB and country priorities. The project is well aligned with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priorities of (i) promoting rural development \nand food security, and addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by improving access \nto electricity and creating economic opportunities in rural areas; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality by creating gender and socially inclusive income-generating activities using renewable mini \ngrids;  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability  by  reducing  AT&C  losses  and  ensuring  efficient  distribution  of \nindigenous renewable hydropower; and (iv) strengthening institutional capacity by providing support \nin improving planning capability and financial performance.12 The proposed investment is also \naligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 for inclusive infrastructure in \nhinterlands and low-income states, and support for economic growth in the less-developed regions \nof the country.13 The project will support India\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution goals14 of \nemission reduction by lowering distribution losses, and United Nations Sustainable Development \n \n8  Government of India, Ministry of Power.

Project Description \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: 24x7 power for all households, industries, \ncommercial businesses, public needs, and other electricity consuming entities achieved (footnote \n6). The project will have the following outcome: efficiency, reliability, and quality of power supply \nto consumers at distribution level in Meghalaya improved.15 \n \n11.  Output 1: Distribution network in Central, East Garo Hills, and West Garo Hills \nstrengthened and modernized. To improve the reliability of power supply to rural electricity \nconsumers and reduce technical losses, the project will (i) construct 23 new 33/11 kV substations, \nand renovation and modernization of 45 33/11 kV substations, including control room equipment \nand protection systems; (ii) install 136 auto-reclosers and 597 fault passage indicators at 11 kV \nand 33 kV lines; (iii) install and upgrade 2,214 kilometers (km) of 33 kV and 11 kV distribution lines; \nand (iv) renovate the rural distribution network to support mini grid in generation in three selected \nvillages. \n \n12.  Output 2: System for meter reading, billing, and collection improved. To reduce \ncommercial losses, the project will replace existing outdated electromechanical meters with smart \nmeters targeting about 180,000 households (about 29% of consumers), and a new meter-testing \nlaboratory will be installed and commissioned. The project will also implement a smart metering \nscheme with online meter reading, billing, and collection with automatic disconnection and \nreconnection of services for up to 75,000 consumers. The project will also be used to evaluate \nthe technical and commercial feasibility for MePDCL in extending smart metering across the state \nin the future. \n \n13.  Output 3: Capacity of executing agency to plan and implement distribution sector \nprojects strengthened. This will include support for (i) preparation of a distribution sector road \nmap that will outline immediate, medium-term, and long-term investments, strategies, and policies \nto systematically develop the distribution sector to meet future system demands and service \nstandards; (ii) preparation of a financial road map to support MePDCL in achieving financial \nsustainability  through  financial  improvement  action  plans  in  meeting  UDAY  Financial \nRestructuring Plan (FRP) targets, separating the financial and human resources functions of \nMePDCL from MeECL, and strengthening their internal audit systems; and (iii) implementation \nsupport to effectively monitor the project and ensure its technical, procurement, and safeguard \ncompliances as required. The road maps and implementation support aim to develop MePDCL\u2019s \ntechnical and financial capacity to systematically plan, design, and manage the distribution \nnetworks. \n \n14.  Output 4: Efficient and productive use of gender- and socially-inclusive mini grid \nenergy systems pilot-tested and promoted. Renewable energy mini grids will be pilot-tested in \nthe three villages (Lower Jambal, Dilma Ading, and Kosigre), and in three selected schools in the \nvillages.16 The mini grids will improve power quality and support income generation, especially for \nwomen  and  other  socially  disadvantaged  groups,  using  indigenous  energy  resources.  The \nvillagers will be engaged in income-generating activities and provided with relevant skills training, \nstart-up capital, and support for market linkage. The project will conduct awareness-raising \n \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16 The selected schools will be in East Garo Hills and West Garo Hills distribution circles. \n ", "5 \nsessions for villagers and students on mini grids and their productive use. The activities under \noutput 4 will be supported by JFPR grant.   \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n15.  This project will be ADB\u2019s first energy sector intervention in Meghalaya. ADB has rich \nfinancing experience in India through previous projects in other states, including in the northeastern \nstate of Assam. ADB will be able to share the lessons and experiences gained from distribution \nimprovement and strengthening projects in Madhya Pradesh and Sri Lanka, and rural electrification \nprojects in Bangladesh and Nepal, and translate these experiences into robust project design and \nimplementation.  ADB  will  help  MePDCL  establish  a  dedicated  project  management  unit  for \nimplementing the project. In addition, ADB has assisted MePDCL in improving its procurement and \nsafeguards monitoring capacity to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and the procurement policy for ADB-financed investments. It is expected that MePDCL will \nmainstream the good practices embedded in ADB policies.  \n \n16.  A comprehensive smart meter component incorporating online meter reading and billing \nwith meter fault detection and monitoring feature will be implemented with the potential to expand \ncoverage  across  the  entire  state  in  the  future.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  developing  mini  grid \ninterventions17 using local energy resources to support gender- and socially-inclusive income-\ngenerating activities in the underdeveloped and poor remote villages will also be explored. ADB has \nalso assisted MePDCL in carrying out (i) surveys, (ii) geographic information system mapping of \ndistribution networks, and (iii) network simulation in selected areas to ensure the design of the \nproposed project is optimal. Several distribution components with technology improvements18 will \nbe introduced under the project to modernize their distribution system, adapt to extreme weather, \nand improve the robustness of the system. These project components will also reduce the power \noutages, and the operation and maintenance cost of the distribution system. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $168.0 million (Table 1). The project team reviewed the \nimpact of COVID-19 on the project and concludes that no significant impact is expected on \nimplementation timeline and costs. The labor required for construction of distribution projects is \nlocally available, and no restriction is imposed on supply of materials for essential services such \nas electricity distribution works.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 Some of the similar interventions in South Asia region include: ADB. 2016.

The government has requested a regular loan of $132.8 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources and $2 million grant from JFPR to help finance the project. The loan will have a \n20\u2013year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 12.75 \nyears and maturity-based premium is therefore nil. The JFPR will provide grant cofinancing \nequivalent to $2.0 million, to be administered by ADB. \n \n19.  The government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decisions  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunications or advice from ADB. \n \n20.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2.

The JFPR grant will finance small equipment and consulting services in relation to \ncommunity interventions (output 4). The state government of Meghalaya will provide counterpart \nfunding to finance state taxes and duties in relation to turnkey contracts, land acquisition and \nresettlement costs, environmental and social mitigation costs, project administration costs, a \nportion of contingencies, and interest during implementation. The state government has assured \nADB that it will cover any shortfall in financing required to meet the agreed outputs.  \n ", "7 \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount   Share of Total  \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \n \nAsian Development Bank \n \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  132.8  79.0 \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (grant)a  2.0  1.2 \nGovernment   33.2  19.8 \nTotal  168.0  100.0 \na  Administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21.  Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $92.6 million, and climate adaptation is estimated to \ncost $27.8 million. ADB will finance approximately 98% of the mitigation cost and 100% of the \nadaptation cost; the JFPR grant will finance the remaining mitigation cost. By modernizing and \nimproving the distribution network, the project will contribute to climate change mitigation through \nmore efficient transfer of renewable hydropower and reduced AT&C losses. The distribution \ninvestments are designed to withstand heavy rainfall, lightning, and high winds to adapt to potential \nclimate change risks in the region.19 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  As  the  executing  agency,  MeECL  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  executing  the \ninvestment project and for its day-to-day implementation. ADB loan proceeds will be channeled \nfrom the Government of India to MeECL through the state government. Goods, equipment, civil \nworks, and consulting services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The state government is also expected to make \ncounterpart funds available to MeECL as equity investments to augment its capital base.  \n \n23.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).20 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2020\u2013August 2025 \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2025 \nEstimated loan and grant  28 February 2026 \nclosing date \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  Power Department, Government of Meghalaya \n(ii) Executing agency  State of Meghalaya acting through MeECL \n(iii) Implementing agencies  MePDCL (outputs 1\u20133) and MNREDA (output 4), both reporting to MeECL \n(iv) Implementation unit  Within MePDCL and MNREDA, 24 MePDCL staff and 3 MNREDA staff \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  7 contracts  $142.8 million \n \n19 The details on mitigation and adaptation financing are in Climate Change Assessment and Climate Risk Vulnerability \nAssessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n20 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2020\u2013August 2025 \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2025 \nEstimated loan and grant  28 February 2026 \nclosing date \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  4 contracts  $4.1 million \nselection  174 national person-months \nRetroactive financing and/or  The Asian Development Bank has approved advance contracting.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  ADB staff undertook technical due diligence to establish the need for the proposed \ndistribution improvement investment requirements in the context of supporting achievement of the \nUDAY targets agreed between the state government of Meghalaya and the central government. \nThe climate change impact on the project is assessed as medium as the project area experiences \nmonsoons and heavy rain. Medium-level risks associated with climate change impacts affecting \nthe project area include damage to distribution lines and substation facilities because of more \nfrequent and more severe extreme events (floods, storms, and lightning). The detailed project \ndesign has incorporated elements to address these risks, including siting of facilities away from \nflood-prone areas, construction of retaining walls, and installation of lightning protection. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Economic viability. The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.21 Without the project, the aged and low-\nefficiency distribution network would aggravate the current high losses and lead to poor-quality \nservice in remote hilly areas. The project\u2019s interventions would reduce distribution line losses, \nexpand network capacity, and improve access to electricity in rural areas of Meghalaya. The \neconomic analysis indicates an economic internal rate of return of 19.6% in constant 2019 prices. \nGiven a hurdle rate of 9%, the project is deemed economically viable based on risk and sensitivity \nanalyses.22 \n \n26.  Financial viability. A financial cost\u2013benefit analysis was conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.23 With the project, \ncommercial  losses  would  be  reduced  by  preventing  theft,  illegal  connections,  and  meter \ntampering; and by replacing defective meters. The project will also result in a significant reduction \nin technical losses, allowing MePDCL to buy less power to meet the same level of demand. The \n \n21 ADB. 2017.

Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "9 \nresults, confirmed through sensitivity analysis, indicate a financial internal rate of return of 11.0%, \nwhich is above the weighted average cost of capital of 8.2%; therefore, the project is deemed \nfinancially viable. \n \n27.  The retail supply tariff will be priced based on the principles set by the jurisdictional \nregulator, the Meghalaya State Electricity Regulatory Commission, which allows full cost recovery \nthrough a tariff.24 The project would generate significant operating cash flows to MePDCL by \nAT&C losses reduction and achieving loss reduction target set by regulator for tariff revision. The \nfinancial internal rate of return for the proposed distribution investment was calculated in real \nterms on an after-tax basis using 2019 constant prices. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  MePDCL faces critical financial and operational sustainability challenges. In FY2016\u2013\nFY2019, it recorded negative profits while its borrowings doubled, mainly because of high AT&C \nlosses and insufficient tariffs. Meghalaya has a weak industrial base and a large share of domestic \nconsumers living below the poverty line. Moreover, industry consumers that pay high tariffs have \nbeen  decreasing.  Furthermore,  Meghalaya\u2019s  geographical  disadvantages  for  grid  electricity \npenetration lead to high losses. MePDCL\u2019s weak financial position should therefore be understood \nin the context of these inherent limitations. \n \n29.  To  achieve  financial  turnaround,  the  government  and  MePDCL  have  taken  various \nactions,  which  include  implementing  a  financial  restructuring  plan  (FRP)  and  improving \noperational efficiency under the UDAY scheme (footnote 8). Under the UDAY FRP, MePDCL \nshould meet the efficiency improvement target. This includes reducing AT&C losses to 15% by \nFY2020, which MePDCL has yet to achieve because of insufficient investment in the distribution \nsystem.25 Reducing AT&C losses and sustainably improving billing efficiency are the fundamental \nand immediate actions needed for MePDCL to achieve financial sustainability as per UDAY FRP. \nHence, for the financial sustainability of Meghalaya\u2019s power sector, immediate implementation of \nthe project is needed. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n30.  As part of the power sector reforms in the state, the former Meghalaya State Electricity \nBoard was unbundled in March 2010 into four companies: MeECL and its three subsidiaries (para \n4). The financial management of MeECL and its three subsidiaries is plagued by the lack of \nadministrative  and  financial  autonomy  of  the  subsidiaries  to  manage  their  revenues  and \nexpenditures. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk of MePDCL is substantial \nmainly because of the absence of a separate and independent finance and administrative \nfunction, significant delay in finalizing accounts, lack of an effective budgetary planning and \ncontrol system, incomplete fixed asset management, and a weak internal audit system. \n \n31.  To  address  these  issues,  MeECL  and  MePDCL  have  agreed  on  comprehensive \ngovernance measures, including ADB\u2019s support to enhance corporate governance and financial \nmanagement.26 The financial road map to be prepared under this project will outline measures to \n \n24 Meghalaya State Electricity Regulatory Commission. 2011. Terms and Conditions for Determination of Tariff \nRegulations. Shillong. \n25 The progress of the UDAY scheme, including its FRP, is described in the financial analysis of MePDCL.

Integrity due diligence was conducted.27 No significant integrity risks were identified. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, MeECL, and MePDCL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19).  \n \n33.  The procurement capacity assessment of MePDCL was conducted as part of due diligence. \nStrategic procurement planning was conducted to maximize the value for money, and the following \nproject procurement arrangements were chosen to lower transaction costs and realize economy \nand transparency: (i) strategic contract packaging by grouping dozens of sub packages of identical \nnature into one package for each circles; (ii) use of the borrower\u2019s e-procurement system; and (iii) \nqualification criteria based on lowest evaluated cost. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The project is located in areas where the majority of residents are poor (poverty target: \ngeneral intervention). Access to a reliable electricity supply will help poor, vulnerable consumers, \nespecially  women,  including  those  who  lack  or  have  limited  access  to  power.  Electricity \nconsumers in the state\u2019s rural areas and the urban area will be the primary beneficiaries. The \nproject will contribute to improving the reliability of power supply for existing consumers, and will \nhelp provide an uninterrupted electricity supply for social infrastructure. \n \n35.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has \nbeen  prepared.  The  JFPR  intervention  is  being  developed  with  an  objective  to  establish \nsuccessful pilot for augmenting community-led income generation activities using renewable \nenergy.  The  project  also  incorporates  gender  indicators  and  targets  to  promote  women\u2019s \nparticipation in rural parts of Meghalaya and supporting capacity development of MeECL and \nMePDCL including gender equality and social inclusion aspects of the energy sector. The loan \nagreements will include standard assurances on core labor standards to be complied with by \ncontractors. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n \n37.  Environment  (category  B).  Given  the  nature,  scale,  and  location  of  the  project \ncomponents, their potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and induced impacts are anticipated to be \nminor,  site-specific,  generally  reversible,  and  readily  mitigated.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) has been undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nand an environmental management plan (EMP) developed. Since the project involves existing \nfacilities (45 substations), an environmental audit has been conducted for all substations and time-\n \n27 ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "11 \nbound, budgeted corrective actions have been incorporated into the EMP.29 The IEE adequately \nidentifies the project\u2019s impacts and risks, and confirms it will not impact on legally protected areas \nor internationally or nationally important biodiversity areas or physical cultural resources. Most \nproject impacts and risks are of temporary duration during construction.30 Pollution, health, and \nsafety risks to workers and the community will remain during operation and maintenance works. \nMitigation  and monitoring measures reflecting  international  good  practice  are  included  and \nbudgeted for (about $0.5 million plus contractor costs) in the EMP along with performance \nindicators to be achieved, such that no residual significant impacts are anticipated. Given the \nlimited  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  for  safeguards  implementation,  a  project \nimplementation consultant will provide training and support the project management units in EMP \nimplementation. Meaningful consultation,31 including with women, has been and will continue to \nbe undertaken, as detailed in the IEE, which was disclosed locally and on the ADB website on 16 \nApril 2020. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Potential impacts of distribution infrastructure \nand JFPR components on land acquisition and involuntary resettlement are not anticipated to be \nsignificant. The project will involve the construction of 23 new 33/11 kV substations, each requiring \na small plot of land. About 5.75 hectares (ha) of land in total will be required for distribution \nsubstations and all the required land for the substations will be acquired through willing-buyer, \nwilling-seller arrangements, and voluntary donation from communities. There should not be any \ncoercion or threat of use of eminent domain in the process. Existing substations will be upgraded \nwithin their existing premises. Construction of 33 kV (771 km) and 11 kV (669 km) new distribution \nlines will pass mostly along the existing right-of-way of roads. The distribution lines are pole-\nbased, which do not require land acquisition.  \n \n39.  For the JFPR components (output 4), a total of 3,031 square meters of land is required for \nthe solar photovoltaic systems with agricultural processing units in three villages. Meaningful \nconsultations have been undertaken, including with women. A combined draft resettlement and \nindigenous peoples plan (RIPP) has been prepared based on the assessment for the MePDCL \nand JFPR components, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national \nregulations. MePDCL and MNREDA will need to secure the budget for RIPP implementation and \nprovide the funds in a timely manner. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Meghalaya is predominantly a tribal state with about \n86% of total population belonging to a scheduled tribe. The project falls in the territory of East \nGaro Hills, West Garo Hills, and Khasi Hills, which belong to tribal areas according to the Sixth \nSchedule of the Constitution of India. Major tribes found in the project area are the Garo, Khasi, \nand Jaintia. The construction of substations, low-voltage lines, and the JFPR components will not \naffect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of the people, and all other impacts \nwill be mitigated. There will be no involuntary land acquisition or resettlement of people from the \nscheduled  tribes.  Consent  letters  are  being  obtained  for  project  installations,  and  all  land \nacquisition will be completed before civil works contracts are awarded. There is no targeted \nintervention for indigenous peoples, and the project impacts are addressed by implementing \nresettlement measures, thus a combined draft RIPP has been prepared. \n \n29 Corrective actions required relate to improving substation pollution, health, and safety risk management including \nCOVID-19 related heath protocols. \n30 These include disturbance to land and communities as project infrastructure is installed; and pollution, health, and \nsafety risks to workers and the community in proximity to works if the construction activities are not well managed. \n31 This involved holding 23 consultation meetings for the distribution components attended by 345 persons in total, and \n3 consultation meetings for the JFPR components attended by 29 persons in total. Women made up about 38% of \nparticipants. \n ", "12 \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n41.
