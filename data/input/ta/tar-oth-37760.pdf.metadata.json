The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  a  member  of  the  working  group  on  Foreign \nExchange and Settlement Issues (FXSI) created under the Forum of Finance Ministers of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and \nRepublic of Korea (ASEAN+3) under the ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Market Initiative (ABMI). ADB has \nbeen requested to support the FXSI\u2019s work by conducting a study on possibly linking the bond \nsettlement systems within the region. As this reflects recent developments in the discussion on the \nsubject, the Technical Assistance (TA) was not included in last year's Subregional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program: Status Report for the Southeast Asia region or the Mekong region. The \nPresident approved the TA's concept clearance on 5 December 2003.1 The design of the TA was \ndiscussed with the concerned countries at the  working group meeting in Kuala Lumpur on 21 \nNovember 2003 and reported at the Deputy Finance and Central Bank Officer's Meeting for \nASEAN+3 in Seoul on 28 November 2003. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Asian Financial Crisis that began in 1997 had a significant impact on the people in the \nregion. The surge in poverty incidence in the region in the aftermath of the Crisis has been well \ndocumented. The mismatch in maturity and currency between debt and revenue for borrowers in \nthe region is one of the key causes of the Crisis.. The excessive dependence on bank financing \nwithout effective governance and alternative sources of funds created the situation where domestic \nbanks  and  companies  borrowed  in  short  term  foreign  currency  for  long-term  local  currency \ngenerating projects.  Although the region has experienced remarkable recovery, without a well-\ndeveloped, efficient source of long-term local currency, these mismatches remain a major source \nof financial vulnerability in the region.  \n \n3.   The ASEAN+3 and other forums, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), \nhave been trying to address this issue through the development of domestic and regional bond \nmarkets. For this purpose, the ASEAN+3 countries endorsed the ABMI at the ASEAN+3 deputies \nmeeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on 17 December 2002. The ABMI emphasizes the need for a \njoint and comprehensive set of actions by the ASEAN+3 countries  to develop domestic and \nregional bond markets in two broad areas: (i) facilitating access to the market by a wide variety of \nissuers, and (ii) creating an environment conducive to developing domestic and regional bond \nmarkets. Six working groups have been set up to examine the factors necessary for bond market \ndevelopment.2  These working groups are expected to provide input into the decision making by \nthe finance ministers of ASEAN+3. ADB has been a member of the all the  voluntary working \ngroups inception.   The efforts of the ASEAN+3 group should have a demonstrative on countries \noutside the group. \n \n4.  Since February 2003,  the  working  groups  have  discussed  the various impediments to \ndomestic and regional bond market development.  Through these discussions ADB has been \nrequested to provide various support including the request for this TA.  For the working group on \ncredit  guarantee  mechanism,  ADB  is  providing  assistance  through  a  study  on  the  regional \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 December 2003. \n2  The six groups, with chair countries in parentheses, are as follows:  (i) creation of a new securitized debt instruments \n(Thailand), (ii) credit guarantee mechanisms (Republic of Korea), (iii) settlement and exchange regulations (Malaysia), \n(iv) issuance of local currency bonds by nondomestic issuers (People\u2019s Republic of China), (v) local and regional rating \nagencies (Japan and Singapore), and (vi) TA coordination (Indonesia and Philippines). \n ", "2   \nguarantee  mechanism.3   The  local  and  regional  rating  agencies  working  group  have  been \nsupported by ADB's coordination with Asian Credit Rating Agencies Association and also have \nrequested ADB  to provide support for the establishment of an Asian Bonds Online Website.4    \nADB has co-hosted a seminar in Beijing for the issuance of local currency bonds by nondomestic \nissuers.    As  for  other  institutions,  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  is  administering  bilateral  technical \nassistance and Bank of Japan has  volunteered to conduct a survey on the enabling factors, \nimpediments and issues relating to foreign exchange transactions and settlement issues. \n \n5.      The absence of a cohesive linkage of bond clearing mechanisms in the region is adversely \naffecting cross border investments  and thus the  development of  domestic and regional bond \nmarkets. This results in more costly and less timely clearance of bond instruments. The lack of an \nefficient  clearing  mechanism  reflects  the  insufficient  volume  of  transactions  to  justify  the \nestablishment  of  a  cross  border  settlement  system,  however  in  turn  it  also  constrains  the \ndevelopment of the bond market.  Without a secure, timely, and cost effective system, the recycling \nof savings into investments in the region is severely hampered in the primary and secondary \nmarkets.   \n \n6.   In  January  1997,  ADB  commissioned  a  study  on  strengthening  clearing  and  settlement \nsystems for bonds.  The study examined various options for providing efficient settlement in the \nregion as well as recommended that ADB undertake a full study into the viability of custodian \nnetwork. Several linkage options were ruled out  because of the  nacent state of the domestic \nsystem.  \n \n7.      After  the  Crisis,  the  policy  makers  and  borrowers  have  realized  the  critical  role  that \ndomestic bond markets play in the stable growth of their economies. At the country-level, there has \nbeen impressive improvement in the bond settlement and payment systems in the region.  The \nvolumes of domestic issuance have increased significantly in the last few years. For example in \n1999, there were only few issuances in Indonesia as compared to USD 2.3 billion equivalent this \nyear. Similarly, the markets have grown in  issuance volume in other ASEAN+3 countries, e.g.,  \nUSD 44 billion equivalent in PRC, USD 5 billion equivalent in Thailand, and  USD 1.9 billion \nequivalent in Malaysia this year. Along with the development of the domestic bond markets the \nsettlement systems have been enhanced since the 1997 ADB study. Scriptless Registry and \nSettlement  and  delivery  against  payment  (DvP)  have  been  established  in  Indonesia.  DvP \nsettlement is expected to be implemented in early 2004 in PRC. Hong Kong and Singapore have \ndeveloped efficient systems with linkages to the international settlement systems, Euroclear and \nClearstream.  Hong Kong has established  bilateral links with  Korea Settlement Deposit  and \nAustraclear  and  is  now  in  the  process  of  linking  with  Central  Depository  Company  (PRC).  \nSingapore also has links with the international systems.  With the installation of cash payments of \ninter-bank  transactions,  the  introduction  of  DvP  based  settlement  of  securities  will  soon  be \nestablished in the Philippines.   \n \n8.  The FXSI working group has therefore requested ADB to help identify the options and make \nrecommendations for effectively accelerating the linkage of domestic settlement and payment \nsystems to facilitate enhanced cross border investment. Since some domestic systems need to be \nenhanced for  such linkage, this would also provide impetus for improving local  settlement and \nclearing.   \n  \n                                                 \n3  ADB.2003.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA aims to reducing the financial  vulnerability in the region by contributing to the \ndevelopment of efficient regional and domestic bond markets in the region.  The specific objective \nof the TA is to assess the possibility of linking settlement systems in the region by examining the \ncurrent status of bond settlement and identifying possible impediments to cross border investment, \nincluding a payment system and a foreign exchange settlement system. The TA will analyze the \nmerits and demerits of linkage for each national system, keeping in mind that systems are in \ndifferent stages of development in the ASEAN+3 countries.5  The TA will recommend options for \nlinking the systems, and develop a possible implementation and preliminary business plan for the \nlinkage.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Through close consultation with private sector participants in the bond market and with \npolicy makers,  the study will  assess the possibility of linking settlement systems in the region. \nGiven the evolving nature of the capital markets, the design of the TA will be kept reasonably \nflexible so that it can meet the emerging needs of the domestic and regional bond markets. ADB \nwill oversee the study in consultation with the FXSI working group under ABMI to ensure that the \nTA satisfies the objectives of the study. The consultants will review previous research and liaise \nwith other working groups to benefit from their experience. The envisaged TA will comprise five \ncomponents. \n \n  1.   Stocktaking of Currently Available Settlement Systems in the Region \n \n11.    The settlement systems in the region will be examined, and previous studies by ADB and \nother institutions  will  be  updated.    Because  a  detailed  study  has  been  undertaken  by  the \nExecutives'  Meeting  of  East  Asia-Pacific  Central  Banks  (EMEAP)  organization,  an  in-depth \ninvestigation of each system will not be necessary.6   \n \n  2.   Merits and Demerits of Linkage \n \n12.     The stage of development of each domestic system will determine how it will benefit from \nthe linkage. The study will examine how  the linkage may  help improve  the efficiency of the \nsettlement systems  and measures needed to overcome  any obstacles to the linkage.  Such \nobstacles may be technological, mechanical, regulatory, legal, or market practices.  \n \n  3.       Analysis of Linkage In and Outside the Region \n \n13.  The examples of and experience with the methods of linkage in Europe and links already \nexist within the region will be analyzed to determine their applicability.    \n \n                                                 \n5 All ASEAN+3 countries with domestic bond markets, including Japan and the Republic of Korea, will be examined in \nthe study, with emphasis on Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. \n6 EMEAP. 2002. Red Book (July 2002) Payment Systems in EMEAP Economies. Available: http://www.emeap.org/ \nredbook2/redbook.pdf \n ", "4   \n  4.   Possible Options for Linkage \n \n14.    ADB\u2019s 1997 study on the possible creation of a regional clearing system put forth several \noptions.7 The options included (i) a web model where the domestic settlement systems are linked \ndirectly to each other to create a network, and (ii) a hub model where all of the domestic systems \nare linked to a single hub.8 The study will look into these models and others to determine the best \nmethod of linkage; analyze the costs; and identify the legal, regulatory, and institutional hurdles \nand propose methods to overcome them.  Dialogue with the market participants and policy makers \nwill be important to gauge the feasibility and financial viability of each option.  A presentation will be \nmade on these options for discussion with the working group at a seminar.       \n   \n  5.   Recommended Option and Preliminary Business Plan \n \n15.  After  consultation  with  and  input  from  the  working  group,  the  best  option  will  be \nrecommended together with a preliminary business plan for the linkage. The business plan will \ninclude the institutional or organizational structure, the contractual relationships between domestic \nsystems,  and  the  scope  of  operational  relationships.    A  preliminary  demand  survey  will  be \nnecessary  to  determine  the  system\u2019s  financial  viability  in  line  with  the  expected  costs  of \nestablishment.  A possible implementation plan will be determined, taking fully into account the \ndifferent stages of development of the national settlement systems and improvement of these \nsystems in the future. \n   \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 equivalent. ADB will provide the entire \namount on a  grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nAppendix 2 gives the details of the TA cost. The participating countries of the working group have \nfinanced the costs of preliminary activities,  and will  continue to  bear the ongoing costs of the \nworking group.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA.  It will be administered by the Southeast Asia \nDepartment in coordination  with Mekong Department,  and Office of Cofinancing Operations. In \nconsultation with the chair of the working group, ADB will supervise the work of the consultants.  \n \n18.  Under  the  TA,  two  international  consultants  (a  settlement  and  payment  specialist  for \n4.5 person-months and a regional bond market specialist for 2.5 person months) will be engaged \nfor a total of 7 person-months on an intermittent basis. They will be engaged by ADB as individual \nconsultants following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consulting Services. The consultants will \nhave demonstrated and comprehensive experience related to bond markets and the development \nof  such  markets.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  presented  in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n19.  The TA will begin in  January 2004 and will be completed by the end of June 2004. The \nconsultants will prepare (i) an inception report, within 1 month of the TA\u2019s start; (ii) an interim report, \nafter the completion of the first four components within 4 months; (iii) a draft final report, within \n5 months; and (iv) a final report on completion of the study. A draft of the interim report will be \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 1997. Technical Study on Strengthening Clearing and Settlement Systems for Bonds.

Upon receipt of the feedback on the draft \nreport on the first four components, a seminar will be arranged to present the results to the working \ngroup in approximately April 2004. A draft final report with all five components will be circulated to \nthe working group in May for comments. Upon receipt of the feedback, a second seminar will be \narranged to present the final report to the working group around June 2004. The report will be used \nfor further discussions and consideration of concrete actions for linking settlement systems in the \nregion to facilitate the accelerated expansion of the bond market in the ASEAN+3 countries. \n \nIV.
