I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangxi Hezhou Environment Restoration and \nSustainable Development Project. The project will help Hezhou (i) reduce pollution in and improve \nthe environment of the former mineral mining area; (ii) provide essential and inclusive social \nservices, including health and elderly care, and skills development; and (iii) strengthen institutions \nto make former mineral mining workers\u2019 living areas in Hezhou green, inclusive, healthy, and \nsustainable. People in Hezhou will benefit from strengthened environmental sustainability and \nimproved services in urban and rural areas. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The PRC witnessed average annual economic growth of about 10% in 1980\u20132009 and \nabout 7% in 2010\u20132020. Behind this remarkable economic growth were industrial and mining \nactivities that polluted and severely damaged the environment, threatening health because of \nweak environmental regulations and inadequate monitoring and enforcement. Many industrial and \nmining areas were left heavily polluted and without adequate environmental protection, and about \n80% of abandoned mining areas are not properly treated.1 The PRC has more than 110,000 \nmines, 244 cities with mineral resource development as the main industry, and 62 resource-\ndepleted cities. The country has more than (i) 2.2 million hectares of mining-damaged land, \n(ii) 11 billion cubic meters of annual output of mine wastewater, and (iii) 48 billion tons of mine \nsolid waste accumulation.2 \n \n3.  As the economy grows, so does demand for a high-quality health-care system. The PRC \ninitiated national health-care reform in 2009 to provide affordable, equitable, and effective health \ncare for all.3 The reform focused on multidimensional aspects of the health system, including \nsocial health security, primary health care, public hospitals, essential medicines, and basic public \nhealth services. The reform made good progress: 95% of the population was covered by social \nhealth insurance by the end of 2017, the rural and urban basic health insurance systems are \nbeing integrated, a tiered health-care system was started in most municipalities, the government \ninvested significantly in the primary health-care system, and overall hospital delivery capacity \nshows an upward trend as seen in the increasing number of beds and doctors.4 However, \nchallenges remain. The PRC has a three-tiered system for health-care delivery: the rural system \nconsists of county-level hospitals, township health centers, and village clinics, while the urban \nsystem consists of municipal, district, and community-level health services.5 Township health \ncenters manage the village clinics. The quality of primary health care is inadequate, and education \nand qualification levels among primary health-care professionals are low.6 Primary health-care \ninstitutions are expected to work closely with communities. Because of the low quality of primary \n \n1  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Land and Resources. 2017. State Land Resource Statistics Yearbook 2017. \nBeijing. \n2  China Geological Survey. 2016.

Most patients return home after \ndischarge from hospitals, which have no referral service. The competitive relationship among \nhospitals\u2019 payment systems hinders efficiency. Medical insurance funds are limited, and many \nrehabilitation  hospitals  provide  services  item  by  item,  lacking  evaluation  and  performance \npayment management. Insufficient coordination and fragmented systems are another challenge. \nIntersector coordination among different health institutions or referral systems is essential to \ndeliver people-centered, integrated, cost-effective care, and to ensure its continuity. \n \n4.  The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) has 9,538 mines; 5,455 are closed or \nabandoned, of which about 30% need treatment for environmental damage.7 Hezhou Municipality \nis in northeast GZAR and has a population of 2.9 million.8 Hezhou is among the least-developed \ncities in GZAR.9 The area, including Hezhou\u2019s Pinggui District and the Kedashan mountain area, \nwas once called the \u201c1,000-year tin capital,\u201d historically known as a source of tin, iron, and other \nminerals; intensive tin mining, led by the state-owned entity, Pinggui Mining Bureau (PMB), \nstarted in the 1900s. Tin resources were exhausted by the 1990s, and private companies \ncontinued mining iron and other minerals. The PMB stopped operation in 2003 after becoming \nbankrupt. The Hezhou Municipal Government (HMG) shut down all illegal and uncertified mining \noperations in Kedashan after a major environmental pollution incident in 2013. It caused the \nshutdown of water supply intakes for 15 days along the He River and the downstream Pearl River, \naffecting about 57 million people. Although the cause of the incident was not the Kedashan mines, \nthe event triggered the HMG to review environmental pollution in Kedashan; the HMG had not \nbeen controlling or mitigating environmental deterioration in the mining areas. By 2017, the last \nlegally operating mineral mining operation in Kedashan was closed. \n \n5.  The HMG started restoring the environment and improving mining sites in 2018 because \nmany were abandoned or not properly closed or restored when the companies stopped operating. \nThe lack of government\u2019s and mining companies\u2019 active management to contain deterioration of \nthe soil and water pollution in the abandoned mining sites, including in Kedashan, and the \nabsence of any meaningful remediation program have exacerbated environmental conditions.10 \nThe HMG urgently needs to improve Kedashan\u2019s environment to avoid potential pollution. \n \n6.  The downturn of the mineral mining industry resulted in dramatic adverse effects on \nprovision of social services and employment in Hezhou, especially in Pinggui, where many mining \nworkers resided.11 Since many have lost their jobs, they have struggled to find new sources of \nincome. In the PRC, state-owned entities supported local communities by providing facilities such \nas housing, schools, and hospitals for workers and their families. \n \n \n7  GZAR  Government,  State  Land  Resource  Department.  2018.

The PRC has provinces, autonomous regions, and provincial centrally administered cities. Under the \nprovinces and autonomous regions are prefectures and prefectural cities. Under the prefectures are counties and \ncounty cities and districts. Under the counties are towns, townships, and urban streets. L. Zhang, R. LeGates, and \nM. Zhao. 2016.

With the PMB bankrupt, the health services it provided ceased or were acquired by a \nprivate medical service provider, and many experienced medical professionals were dismissed \nand relocated. The distribution of medical resources in Hezhou is unbalanced, with high-quality \nmedical services concentrated in Babu District, which undertakes acute medical treatment, and \nprimary health-care service at local hospitals is inadequate. The only public county-level hospital \nin Pinggui was designated as a Hezhou municipal-level infectious diseases hospital in 2020 and \ndoes not offer general medical services.12 Townships and villages have hospitals, but their service \nquality and capacity are limited. In addition to providing the required facilities, Pinggui urgently \nneeds to improve health services and design strong health institutions and systems to meet local \nhealth-care needs, especially to manage allocation of medical service resources in the district, \nlocal occupational diseases that affect mining communities, provision of women\u2019s health care, \nintegration of community health care and well-being, and building of healthy communities. Pinggui \ndoes not have a rural three-tiered health-care system that is led by a county-level hospital and \ncoordination and referral system between different levels of health care in the district and other \ncity health institutions. Efforts to strengthen coordination among health service providers in the \nrural three-tiered health-care system can be supported by the growing availability of digital health-\ncare solutions such as internet-based diagnoses in remote areas, online appointments, medical \nreports, and billings, and smart information technology-based hospital operation and facility \nmanagement. \n \n8.  The elderly, aged over 65 years old, account for 9.5% of Pinggui\u2019s population. Many \nelderly, including their families, prefer home-based care. But after being discharged from a \nhospital to receive care and rehabilitation, they need affordable services and facilities for the \ndisabled, semi-disabled, or those affected by dementia. The Pinggui Integrated Health and Elderly \nCare Center (PIHECC), working with the Xiwan Community Medical Center, can meet the needs \nof the growing number of elderly. However, the Xiwan Community Medical Center lacks the \nmanagement capacity to set up coordination systems between medical and elderly-care facilities, \nadministration standards, and evaluation systems. \n \n9.  Although mineral mining has stopped, Hezhou is still a leading producer of high-quality \nmarble, general stonework products, and calcium carbonate. Hezhou has been shifting  its \neconomy to calcium carbonate-based industries and creating a green and circular economy.13 \nIndustries in Pinggui are upgrading their technologies, and demand for workers who have green \nand modern production knowledge and skills is increasing. As local jobs increase, many out-\nmigrated workers working in other provinces are willing to return to Pinggui. Left-behind women \nwill have job options if family members can live together and share household tasks. Pinggui \nresidents have high demand for skills training, including in health and patient care, to care for \nfamily members. Pinggui does not have any skills-training public institutions. Hezhou has several \ndegree-granting colleges and institutions offering technical and vocational education and training, \nand private educational and training institutions. However, the institutions cannot accommodate \nor provide residents with adequate nondegree training in market-demanded practical skills and \nknowledge. Pinggui is establishing a public Knowledge and Skills Sharing Center (KSSC) to offer \nshort- and medium-term nondegree practical training. Still, Pinggui lacks the capacity to plan and \noperate the needed skills training. \n \n10.  COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic amplified health \nrisks, particularly for Hezhou and Pinggui, because of their inadequate health-care services. The \nonly public county-level hospital in Pinggui was designated for infectious diseases (including \n \n12 Pinggui has only one county-level private medical institution and it does not meet Pinggui\u2019s demand. \n13 Calcium carbonate-based industries are growing globally, and Hezhou\u2019s economic growth was 7% in 2020.

Measures to prevent infectious diseases are needed. Environmental improvement and \nprovision of health services are critical to the PRC\u2019s recovery from COVID-19, and the project is \ncommitted to helping achieve that goal. \n \n11.  Strategic alignment. The project will support the Outline of the Plan for Healthy China \n2030 and the Healthy Hezhou 2030 Plan by improving the quality and services of the health-care \nsystem; and the PRC\u2019s Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025 by improving the environment, \ncontrolling pollution, and strengthening the health system.14 A PRC circular identified the county-\nlevel cities, districts, and counties as critical to carrying out urbanization.15 County-level areas \nlack the capacity, services, and infrastructure to ensure quality public services and a livable \nenvironment,  and  job  skills  support,  including  for  rural\u2013urban  migrants.  The  circular  listed \nenvironmental and health capacity and facilities as critical areas for improvement. The project \naligns with GZAR\u2019s strategy to promote systems that can improve referrals for graded diagnosis \nand treatment, and Hezhou\u2019s plan to pilot comprehensive reform of urban public hospitals and \ndevelop an integrated health- and elderly-care system. The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 exposed \nthe county-level areas\u2019 vulnerability to the epidemic because of lack of capacity and environmental \n \nand sanitation facilities, which the project can remedy.\n \n12.  The project is aligned with six operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nStrategy 2030 by boosting human capital and social protection;  gender equality in human \ndevelopment; environmental sustainability; access, quality, and reliability of urban services; rural \ndevelopment; and governance and institutional capacity for service delivery.16 The project is in \nline with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, by strengthening health systems and \nelderly care, and with the country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025, by reducing \npollution, responding to the needs of an aging society, and strengthening institutions for health- \nand  elderly-care  systems.17 The  project  supports  the  achievement  of  the  United  Nations\u2019 \nSustainable Development Goals 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 15.18 \n \nB.

For health care, the output will support  the design of a practical \ninstitutional working mechanism and system to build a medical community, through which the \nPinggui Workers\u2019 Hospital (PWH) will coordinate support to strengthen the quality and capacity of \ntownship and village-level primary health care; establishment of a medical community information \nplatform at PWH, connected with Pinggui\u2019s township and village-level public medical institutions; \nconstruction of PWH, a county-level IIA general public hospital;21 development of administration \ncapacity of managers and technical capacity of doctors, nurses, health-care workers, and staff of \nPWH to deliver high-quality services; upgrade of equipment of nine township-level hospitals to \nimprove primary-care service delivery and quality; and provision of training to build the technical \ncapacity of township and village-level rural hospital staff to improve primary-care service quality. \nFor elderly care, the output will support the construction of PIHECC; establishment of working \nmechanisms and integration of medical and elderly care at PIHECC, including administration and \noperation capacity training for the center\u2019s administrators and managers; and development of \ntechnical capacity of PIHECC health-care staff (doctors, nurses, caregivers) to deliver high-quality \nservices. The constructed project facilities will be green (certified as Chinese Green Building \nStandard [CGBS] Star-2 after operation) and inclusive (considering the needs of women, persons \nwith disabilities [PWDs], the elderly, and ethnic minorities).22 The facilities will adopt building \ninformation modeling for lean building construction and operation and maintenance (O&M), \nincluding green procurement. \n \n16.  Output 3: Green and health care-related skills development institutions established. \nAs part of the Pinggui subproject, the output will help Hezhou provide Pinggui residents with \nnondegree vocational skills development opportunities to match the latest market needs, including \ngreen and health care-related skills. To offer the required nondegree training, the government will \nconstruct the KSSC, which will be green (certified as CGBS Star-2 after operation) and inclusive \n(considering the needs of women, PWDs, the elderly, and ethnic minorities). The output will \nsupport an operational study to optimize training quality at the KSSC based on demand, including \nskills certification mechanisms, a human resource development plan, and course setting in \npotential collaboration with local private companies; preparation of a training plan for KSSC \nmanagers and teachers; and provision of equipment required for course and training delivery. \n \n17.  Lessons. The lessons from ongoing ADB projects and international and national best \npractices on land remediation and urban environmental improvement, elderly care, and flagship \n \n21 General hospitals are classified into grades I, II, and III, based on size, facilities, and staffing. Secondary hospitals \n(grade II A or B) are regional hospitals that provide comprehensive medical and health services to communities and \nhave 101\u2013500 beds. \n22 Government of the PRC, Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development. 2019.

Beijing (in Chinese). \n \n ", "6 \nknowledge publications are considered in the project design.23 The lessons include the adoption \nof a nature-based approach and inclusion of a long-term environment- and pollution-monitoring \nsystem of the environmentally restored areas; importance of quality and timely implementation of \nnonconstruction activities, such as institutional strengthening, system or mechanism design, and \ncapacity building that supports activities in the constructed project facilities because governments \ntend to prioritize construction activities; alignment of skills development systems with changing \nlabor market requirements and new technologies; and activities and budget to disseminate the \nknowledge generated from the project. The project design incorporates adequate provision and \nbudget  to  ensure  that  high-quality  consultants  provide  technical  support  to  institutional \nstrengthening, capacity building, and knowledge dissemination. The Hezhou project management \noffice (HPMO) and the implementing agencies will establish working groups for each technical \nstudy, including municipal and county-level bureaus and stakeholders, which will be crucial in \nadopting recommendations to improve municipal institutional mechanisms. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n18.  The government\u2019s initial proposal was a conventional construction- and engineering-\nbased approach. During project preparation, ADB, the HMG, and the implementing agencies had \nnumerous discussions to think innovatively to tackle Hezhou\u2019s development needs sustainably, \naligned with the PRC\u2019s development priorities. Collaboration with ADB changed stakeholders\u2019 \nmindsets and the discussions have helped emphasize the importance of capacity development, \ninstitutional strengthening, policy implementation, and project design based on a sound demand \nsurvey and analysis. The design of the Kedashan subproject was significantly improved by \nreassessing  site  conditions,  reducing  engineering  intervention  by  applying  a  nature-based \napproach, which resulted in lower and optimized project costs. Environmental monitoring of the \nsite is programmed to ensure the sustainability of the restoration activities and monitoring of their \neffects beyond the project period. Although the PRC has been implementing nature-based \napproaches  in  environmental  improvement  projects,  practical  assessment  or  evaluation  of \nwhether the project achieved the intended nature-based outcomes is still being established in the \nPRC.24 Therefore, the project will conduct a technical study to holistically guide and assess the \nnature-based approach for environmental improvement in Kedashan. \n \n19.  The project will help strengthen health systems in the whole of Pinggui and improve \nutilization efficiency to benefit rural areas through a well-integrated, three-tiered system of county-\nlevel hospitals, township health centers, and village-level hospitals. ADB helped conduct surveys \nand interviews and set the functional positioning of PWH. The hospital will add departments for \noccupational disease, geriatrics, gynecology, rehabilitation, physiotherapy, and mental health \nbased on community needs. Township health centers will be supported to improve the quality of \nprimary medical care and elderly care. The project is the first ADB project in the PRC to handle \ncounty-level district health system design and extend capacity building to improve township and \nvillage-level primary-care medical service and quality. Information technology will support medical \ncommunity coordination among three levels of hospitals and the design, construction, and \noperation of PWH.

Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nPAM (footnote 25). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2022\u2013June 2028 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2028 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project leading group, comprising the party secretary of the Communist Party of \nChina  Hezhou  Committee  and  the  mayor  of  the  HMG  (co-chairs),  and \nrepresentatives from the HMG and relevant agencies, including HDRC and HFB \n(members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  HMG \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  HMIGC, PDG \n(iv)  Implementation units  (i) Hezhou PMO, headed by a director with eight staff, to provide overall \nguidance,  supervision,  coordination,  and  management  support  for  project \nimplementation on behalf of the HMG; (ii) the Pinggui PMO established within \nthe PDG, headed by the district mayor with five officers; (iii) the PIU under each \nimplementing agency: HMIGC (a director with 10 staff) and PUCIC (a director \nwith 8 staff) \nProcurement  OCB (internationally advertised)  1 contract  $32.68 million \nOCB (nationally advertised)  8 contracts  $113.72 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  1,158 person-months  $4.70 million \nConsultants\u2019 qualification selection  187 person-months  $2.25 million \n  Individual consultants\u2019 selection  19 person-months  $0.25 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting includes two works and three consulting service packages. \nadvance contracting   Retroactive financing will apply to up to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures \nincurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before the \nsigning of the loan agreement. \nDisbursement  Disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  follow  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HDRC = Hezhou Development and Reform Commission, HFB = Hezhou Finance \nBureau, HMG = Hezhou Municipal Government, HMIGC = Guangxi Hezhou Mining Investment Group Company \nLimited, OCB = open competitive bidding, PDG = Pinggui District Government, PIU = project implementation unit, PMO \n= project management office, PUCIC = Hezhou Pinggui Urban Construction Investment Company Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n27 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  The nonconstruction components are designed to engage experienced and qualified \nexperts to provide inputs because the topics are innovative and new areas in the PRC. The \nproject\u2019s engineering design complies with the PRC\u2019s guidelines and local regulations and \nconsiders resource efficiency and environmental protection, green procurement, human-centered \ninclusive design, and technology integration. The recommended technologies are inexpensive \nand suitable for Hezhou\u2019s climate. The Kedashan subproject design was optimized to use nature-\nfriendly measures rather than engineering-oriented \u201chard\u201d measures, which resulted in cost \nsavings and less environmental impact. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment found that \nthe subproject sites would have medium risk from climate change impact. The implementing \nagencies will ensure that detailed project designs incorporate adjustments to engineering designs \nderived from assessment results as proactive adaptation and mitigation measures. The three \nproject buildings under the Pinggui subproject will be certified as CGBS Star-2. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  Economic.  For  output  1,  the  least-cost  analysis  was  used  to  evaluate  alternative \napproaches to improve environmental conditions. The environmental benefits were unquantified \nbecause of difficulties with quantifying the benefits. The project\u2019s overall economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is estimated at 10.2%, which is above the 9% minimum requirement for social sector \nprojects. The net present value (NPV) of the project benefits for the entire project is CNY106.1 \nmillion. The overall EIRR and NPV were calculated without quantifying the benefits of output 1 \nbut including the project costs of output 1. Thus, the project EIRR and NPV should be considered \nconservative. Each project component was found to be economically viable. The economic \nbenefits of output 2 mainly come from increased access to health services, improved population \ncoverage, reduced travel costs and risks for diseases, and more disability-adjusted life years \naverted for the target population. Ability to secure better jobs is expected for adults who will \nreceive continuing education from the skills-related component of output 3. The sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the project\u2019s economic return is robust against negative impacts from benefit \nreduction, cost overrun, and project implementation delay.28 \n \n28.  Financial. The financial analysis focused on the project\u2019s financial sustainability, as the \nsubprojects do not generate revenue. The financial statement analysis of the end-borrowers\u2014\nGuangxi Hezhou Mining Investment Group Company Limited (HMIGC) and Hezhou Pinggui \nUrban Construction Investment Company Limited (PUCIC)\u2014and the fiscal analysis of the Pinggui \nDistrict Government (PDG) were conducted to determine the project\u2019s financial sustainability. The \nfinancial analysis confirmed the capacity of the end-borrowers to cover the project\u2019s incremental \nrecurrent costs to sustain the facilities, and financial covenants were included in the legal \nagreements to ensure compliance. The PDG regularly financially supports PUCIC and relies \nheavily on upper-government subsidies. The government gave its assurance that it will provide \nadequate budgetary support to the project.29 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.  The financial sustainability analysis shows that the fiscal burden of the subprojects in \nrelation to the end-borrowers' budget is negligible. This suggests that the subprojects\u2019 financial \n \n28 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nrequirements are affordable for the implementing agencies and financially sustainable. The HMG \nhas assured ADB that it will provide counterpart funding to cover the project\u2019s O&M costs and \ndebt service repayments if any of the entities fail to fulfill their financing requirements. The \nassurance is included in the legal agreements, and the project facilities\u2019 O&M arrangement is \ndetailed in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nD.  Governance \n \n30.  Financial management. A financial management assessment evaluated the capacity of \nthe  HMG  and  the  two  end-borrowers,  which  will  handle  the  project  financial management \narrangements. The review considered the capacity of the GZAR Finance Department, which will \nmanage the project's advance account. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk \nis  substantial,  mainly  because  the  end-borrowers  have  no  experience  implementing  ADB-\nfinanced projects and no internal audit in place. A financial management action plan agreed with \nthe HMG, the two implementing agencies, and the project implementation units is in the PAM \n(footnote 25) and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \n31.  Procurement. Value for money will be achieved through contract packaging, selection of \nprocurement method and bidding procedure, and proposed advance procurement arrangement. \nThe arrangement resulted from a strategic procurement planning exercise that considered the \nstrategic  project  priorities,  risks  and  opportunities,  borrowers\u2019  operating  conditions,  market \nconditions, and adaptation of green procurement. The overall procurement risk is medium. \nMeasures to mitigate the risks are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \n32.  Anticorruption and integrity. The HMG and the implementing agencies have committed \nto actively detect corruption or corruption-related misdeeds such as money laundering.31 The \nactivity  will  be  aided  by  close  government  interagency  cooperation  between  stakeholder \nagencies, including financial, procurement, and audit. Integrity due diligence was conducted on \nHMIGC and PUCIC and the members of their boards of directors and management.32 They do \nnot appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk since no unresolved or \nother relevant information related to them exists. ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that \nHMIGC and PUCIC were not established and are not being used for money laundering or \nterrorism financing in the project jurisdiction. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the PRC and GZAR governments, the HMG, and the \nimplementing agencies. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Poverty  and  social.  The  project is  classified  as  a  general  intervention  for  poverty \nreduction. The poverty and social analysis was undertaken based on online and field surveys and \nstakeholder  consultations  with  project-affected  persons;  city,  district,  township,  and  village \ngovernment agencies; members of the Persons with Disabilities Association; and the Women\u2019s \nFederation. A total of 481,000 residents in the project area, including poor and low-income people \n(20.0%), women (47.6%), PWDs (6.6%), the elderly (9.5%), and ethnic minorities (13.3%), will \n \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Although strict laws against corruption are in place, implementation still faces challenges.

About 1,095 jobs are estimated to be created during \nproject construction and operation. About 350,000 people who use the He River as their drinking \nwater and irrigation water source and patients from neighboring counties will indirectly benefit \nfrom the project. A social and gender action plan (SGAP) has been prepared, with targets for low-\nincome people and PWDs, and requirements for inclusive design and O&M of project facilities. \nA consultation and participation plan for project implementation is in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \n34.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, following ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.33 A gender analysis undertaken during project preparation indicated that women in \nthe project area have fewer educational, employment, and income-earning opportunities than \nmen because of family responsibilities. Women look after the children and the elderly, do \nhousehold chores, work on local farms as temporary hands, and engage in local nonfarm work. \nAbout 67,000 male and 39,000 female out-migrants are from Pinggui. About 25,000 women are \nleft behind in Pinggui compared with 4,000 men. Women need skills training in medical care, \nelderly care, and e-commerce, and knowledge on preventing chronic and common gynecological \ndiseases. The project opens opportunities for women to participate in and benefit from project \nactivities. The SGAP includes consultations on project facilities\u2019 design and O&M to ensure the \nfacilities\u2019 usability and comfort for female staff and visitors; promotion of green and health care-\nrelated skills training for women by setting quotas; annual skills-training needs assessment by \ngender; and quotas for jobs created by the project. Key gender targets are in the design and \nmonitoring framework (footnote 20). The HPMO will engage consultants to help implement the \nSGAP. The HPMO will submit semiannual progress reports on SGAP implementation, and an \nindependent external monitor will verify the reports. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are in paras. 36\u201338.34 The safeguard categories were each assessed as having low \nCOVID-19\u2013related risks during implementation. \n \n36.  Environment (category A). An environmental impact assessment (EIA), including an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), complying with the PRC\u2019s environmental laws and in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, was prepared. The EIA incorporated findings \nof the domestic feasibility study and domestic EIAs, the climate risk and vulnerability assessment, \nthe biodiversity assessment, site visits, and consultations with stakeholders. The EIA identified \npotential direct, indirect, cumulative, and induced environmental impacts and risks for the project\u2019s \npreconstruction, construction, and operation phases. COVID-19 prevention and control measures \nare included in the occupational health and safety plan as part of the EMP. Avoidance of adverse \neffects through design and site management and mitigation measures through construction \nmanagement  are  identified  in  the  EMP.  An  assessment  was  conducted  to  determine  the \nsignificance of project impacts and risks in Kedashan because of land degradation and soil \nerosion, surface and groundwater contamination from mine tailing and heavy metals, impacts on \nbiodiversity and natural resources, and impacts because of inadequate medical infrastructure in \nPinggui. Adequate measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential impacts and risks are in the \n \n33 ADB. 2021. Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects. Manila. \n34 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", "12 \nEMP. Mitigation measures identified in the EMP require environmental compliance to manage air, \nwater, and noise pollution, and hazardous wastes, including mine tailing wastes and biomedical \nwastes from PWH and PIHECC. Adoption of nature-friendly measures to manage the former \nmineral mining area in Kedashan and development of capacity to monitor the environment and \npollution in the long term are expected to have positive environmental impacts. The climate \nchange assessment identified intense precipitation, flooding, and extremely high temperatures as \nthe most important risks affecting the project, and key recommendations are incorporated into the \nEMP to adapt to these climate risks. The EMP includes a plan for internal monitoring by \ncontractors during construction and O&M during operation. The HPMO, with the support of \nconsultants, will monitor EMP implementation and report to ADB semiannually. The HPMO will \nrecruit an external monitoring entity to evaluate and assess the implementation of and compliance \nwith the EMP and report to ADB semiannually. Environmental management and monitoring, \ncapacity development, and institutional strengthening activities are included in the project to \nmitigate risks. Two rounds of meaningful consultations were conducted with all stakeholders \nduring project preparation and the findings incorporated into the project design. Any potential \nenvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress \nmechanism  (GRM)  designed  for  the  project.  The  EIA  concluded  that  the  anticipated \nenvironmental impacts and risks can be mitigated to acceptable levels by adhering to effective \nEMP implementation and following prescribed training and capacity-building measures. The draft \nEIA and EMP were disclosed on the ADB website on 15 July 2021. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The Kedashan subproject will cover 487.53 mu \ncollectively owned by the Baisha community and Chaqing village and not contracted by individual \nhouseholds.35 The land will be available through a land use rights transfer (LURT) agreement \nduring the 6-year project implementation. HMIGC prepared a LURT framework to guide the \npreparation of LURT plans and finalization of agreements during project implementation. The \nPinggui subproject will occupy 128.84 mu. The PDG initiated land acquisition for the identified \nsites in accordance with Pinggui\u2019s urban development plan (formulated in 2011 by Hezhou \nConstruction  Bureau)  and  not  in  anticipation  of  ADB  funding  the  Pinggui  subproject.  ADB \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguard requirements are triggered because of the ongoing land \nacquisition  and  house  demolition  activities.  Acquisition  of  27  mu  of  land  belonging  to \n36 households, including 17 with residential structures, is ongoing and expected to be completed \nby 31 December 2021. Involuntary resettlement impacts have been assessed as significant for a \ntotal of 98 affected persons in the 17 households whose houses will be demolished. The \nresettlement due diligence report confirms that the land acquisition process and resettlement \nactivities are consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and PRC requirements, and that \nresettlement of the remaining households will be monitored internally and externally. Capacity of \nthe  implementing  agencies  will  be  strengthened  to  implement  involuntary  resettlement  in \naccordance with ADB safeguard requirements and to conduct internal monitoring. During project \nimplementation, the HPMO, with support from the implementing agencies, will prepare the LURT \nplan based on a detailed measurement survey and submit the plan to ADB for endorsement \nbefore the award of civil works contracts; ensure that the GRM is functional and accessible to \naffected persons; make the budget for resettlement implementation available on time; monitor \nand report on resettlement implementation; and engage an external monitor to monitor and \nevaluate the implementation of the LURT plan and the actions identified in the resettlement due \ndiligence report, and submit semiannual reports to ADB for disclosure on its website. \n \n38.
