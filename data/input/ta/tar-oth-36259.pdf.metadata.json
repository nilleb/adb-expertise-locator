The Pacific islands region has a high degree of ecosystem and species diversity and is  \nvery vulnerable to a wide range of natural and environmental disasters. The region also has a \nhigh  degree  of  economic  and  cultural  dependence  on  the  natural  environment  with  an \nextraordinary diversity of cultures and languages, traditional practices, and customs centered on \nthe marine and coastal environment. The Pacific islands, except for Papua New Guinea, are \namong the world\u2019s smallest and most remote states, and generally have isolated populations \nliving in very low concentrations.  \n \n2.  Only a few Pacific island communities have access to modern energy sources, and \nthose with access rely heavily on imported fossil fuels. An estimated 70% of the people in \nPacific developing member countries (PDMCs) have no access to electricity.1 For those with \naccess to electricity and transportation, imported petroleum products account for approximately \n80% of primary commercial energy consumption. Half the imported petroleum products are \nconsumed by the transport sector and 40% is used in diesel-fired power generation units.  \nRenewable energy, mostly mini-hydro, contributes less than 10% of commercial energy use.  \n \n3.  A fact-finding mission to Fiji Islands and Samoa was undertaken in May 2002. The \nmission  met  with  senior  government  officials,  representatives  of  bilateral  and  multilateral \nagencies,  and  senior  staff  of  major  regional  agencies,2  to  discuss  the  regional  technical \nassistance for the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program for the Pacific.3 The TA \nframework is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Access  to  modern  forms  of  energy  is  an  essential  prerequisite  for  economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction as well as a key determinant of the quality of life and the \nlevel of social development. While few data are available on the welfare impacts of different \nkinds  of  interventions  in  the  energy  sector,  development  practitioners  agree  on  the  links \nbetween energy and poverty reduction. The priority for the poor is the satisfaction of their basic \nhuman needs, such as food; employment; and access to health, education, housing, water, and \nsanitation. To meet these needs, access to modern, reliable, and affordable forms of energy is \ncrucial. Therefore, one of the main challenges for a developing country is to increase energy \navailability in a cost-effective way.  \n \n5.  The  cost  of  providing  energy  is  very  high  because  consumers  are  dispersed  and \ndomestic  markets  are  small.  Despite  the    high  cost,  however,  consumption  of  energy  is \nexpected to increase as PDMCs develop and modernize.  In some of the less developed \ncountries, such as Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu and \nVanuatu, it is imperative, in order to improve access to basic services, to increase availability of \nmodern energy supply. The outer island communities are the most disadvantaged because of \ntheir remote and isolated locations. The cost of conventional energy in these countries is 3-4 \ntimes that in PDMC capital cities, and is higher than in neighboring industrialized countries such \nas Australia and New Zealand. Because the level of energy consumption depends on the \n                                                 \n1  Forum Secretariat. 2001. Communiqu\u00e9 of the 30th Pacific Islands Forum, Nauru.

", "2    \navailable energy services and their affordability, energy supply costs are critical for poverty \nalleviation.    \n \n6.  In almost all PDMCs, renewable energy sources in the form of hydropower, wind, solar, \nbiofuel, geothermal, ocean thermal, and wave/tidal energy hold high potential for contributing to \nsustainable  development.  This  is particularly true in the remote rural areas, as renewable \nenergy will reduce the dependence on fossil fuel for power generation and transportation. \nGreater use of renewable energy use, coupled with improved energy efficiency, offer PDMCs a \nmajor avenue toward meeting their energy requirements. In addition, as most of the islands are \nwell  endowed  with  a  good  renewable  resource  base,  renewable  energy  technologies  are \npotentially  highly  competitive  with  conventional  energy,  especially  when  environmental \nexternalities are factored into the analysis.  \n \n7.  Through the past 3 decades, many funding agencies have provided substantial technical \nand financial support to renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in the Pacific region, \nbut in a rather fragmented and discontinuous way. Most initiatives were implemented as top-\ndown,  supply-driven  demonstration/pilot  projects,  with  the  environmental  benefits  usually \nrepresenting the main, and often the only, justification. While the establishment of appropriate \ninstitutional arrangements as well as a suitable enabling policy and private sector environment \nwas identified as an important priority area, most of the projects had poorly designed non-\npriority project components. Additional reasons for project failures are (i) unrealistic and often \ntoo ambitious project goals and objectives; (ii) immediate objectives and outputs too far-fetched \nand generalized; (iii) project activities and objectives often incompatible with existing policies, \nsocioeconomic  structures,  and  sociocultural  traditions;  (iv)  lack  of  appreciation  of  local \ncapacities and opportunities, as well as proper analysis of constraints and limiting factors with \nrespect to the local private sector, household level participation, and local public and private \ninstitutions; (v) grant-funded supply of project equipment with resulting low sense of ownership; \nand (vi) insufficient support to improve policy frameworks at the country level. \n \n8.  The many remaining issues include: (i) insufficient understanding and awareness of the \npotentials of renewable energy and energy efficiency resources; (ii) inadequate institutional \ncapacities and technical expertise to plan, manage, and maintain renewable energy and energy \nefficiency programs; (iii) the absence of a clear market-based policy, legislation, and regulatory \nframework; (iv) a lack of confidence in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies by \nthe main stakeholders due to the very limited success of technology demonstration programs; \n(v) limited policy commitment and financial support to the sector; and (vi) over-reliance on \nexternal aid-funded projects.    \n \n9.  The main programs currently under implementation incorporate some of the lessons \nlearned from past projects. Among these are two recent initiatives, the Pacific energy policy and \nplan (PEPP) developed by the Committee of Regional Organizations of the Pacific (CROP)4 and \nthe  Pacific  Islands  Renewable  Energy  Project  (PIREP)  supported  by  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and Global Environmental Facility (GEF). PIREP5 builds on \nwork undertaken under the Pacific Island Climate Change Assistance Program (PICCAP) and \naims at supporting regional and national interventions that remove barriers to renewable energy \ndevelopment and facilitate promotion, use, and commercialization of renewable technologies \n                                                 \n4  The  CROP  Energy  Working  Group  comprises  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Secretariat  (FORSEC),  Pacific  Power \nAssociation (PPA), Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission \n(SOPAC)  South  Pacific  Community  (SPC),  University  of  the  South  Pacific  (USP)  and  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme. \n5  PIREP covers 14 countries and has a duration of 18 months with a budget of US$840,000. Implementation started \nin August 2002.  ", "    3\nthrough  the  establishment  of  a  suitable  enabling  environment.  The  South  Pacific  Applied \nGeoscience Commission (SOPAC) also implements a number of energy and renewable energy \nprograms in: (i) energy resource assessment (wind, biomass, ocean-based resources, and \ngeothermal);  (ii)  energy  conservation,  efficiency,  and  demand-side  management;  and  (iii) \nenergy and environment education through a new postgraduate course in wind energy at the \nUniversity of South Pacific (USP). Another ongoing program is the Pacific Rural Renewable \nEnergy France-Australia Common Endeavour (PREFACE).6 Its goal is to increase utilization of \nRenewable  Energy  sources,  in  particular  solar  photovoltaic  and  wind  energy,  through  the \ndevelopment  of  country-level  sustainable  financial  and  management  arrangements.  Finally, \nsince 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with cofinancing from the Government of the \nNetherlands, is implementing in the Asia-Pacific region a TA for promoting renewable energy, \nenergy efficiency, and greenhouse gas abatement projects.7 The TA supports renewable energy \nand energy efficiency development through among others, removal of policy and institutional \nbarriers; preparation of renewable energy and energy efficiency country strategies, programs \nand work plans; generation of a pipeline of investment projects for consideration for financing; \nand development of financial schemes. \n \n10.  This TA will build on the results of PIREP,  PREFACE, the ADB TA (footnote 7), and \nother projects in the region by supporting the establishment in two PDMCs of an appropriate \nenvironment for the development of a demand-driven and private-sector-based energy market. \nThe TA, by focusing on removing barriers and allowing fair competition in only two PDMCs, will \nuse  a  systematic,  medium-term  and  in-depth  assistance  approach,  in  which  the  use  of \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency will be a major pillar. In this way, the TA will address \nmost of the current constraints to development of renewable energy and energy efficiency, \n(para. 8) and will support the ultimate goal of significantly increasing PDMCs\u2019 rural community \naccess to commercially viable energy services. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to help create an environment that will enable the development \nof a market-based rural energy sector, in which mature renewable energy and energy efficiency \napplications play a key and increasing role. This process will involve the development of the \nrequired policy, legal, and institutional framework. The TA will also facilitate mobilization of \nexternal financing by building a pipeline of potential renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects for funding/cofinancing by ADB, GEF, and/or other sources. \n \n12.  The outputs in the two selected PDMCs will include (i) review of, consultations on, and \ndissemination of lessons from past renewable energy and energy efficiency assistance in the \nPacific; (ii) an action plan for the adoption of appropriate policies, institutional arrangements, \nlegal/regulatory measures, and financial schemes including venture capital, as well as private \nsector and household-level incentive mechanisms for promoting commercially viable renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency services; (iii) a training needs analysis and training curricula for \nprivate and public sector key players in the two PDMCs; (iv) a pipeline of projects for funding by \nADB, GEF, and/or other relevant financing sources; and (v) based on outcomes and progress \nmade in the two selected countries, final consultations and dissemination of lessons learned \n                                                 \n6  PREFACE, a program implemented by SPC and started in 2000 is jointly funded by France and Australia, and has \na 3-year duration with a budget of A$3 million.   \n7 ADB. 2001.

Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Through the provision of technical support to the national implementing agency and a \nhigh level TA steering committee in each of the two participating PDMCs, the TA will introduce \nan effective approach for creating a policy environment enabling a demand-driven private sector \nmarket for rural energy services. In relation to this, the TA will  develop local capabilities in the \nnecessary policy, institutional, and legal/regulatory reforms.  To avoid overlapping activities and \nreplication of past mistakes, the TA will conduct, during inception, a comprehensive stocktaking \nof prior and ongoing related to renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives in the region, \nas well as closely coordinate, during the implementation period, with other ongoing programs. \nDuring inception, the TA will establish solid links with existing country-level committees, working \ngroups,  and  country  teams,  such  as  PICCAP  country  team,  PIREP  country  teams,  etc. \nMoreover, to ensure continuity and momentum of progress, the TA will generate a pipeline of \nrural energy projects based on renewable energy and energy efficiency, for possible financing \nby  ADB,  GEF,  and/or  other  sources,  even  before  termination  of  the  TA.  To  ensure  full \ncommitment  and  TA  success,  the  selected  PDMC  governments  will  prepare  and  issue  a \nCabinet-approved development policy letter on renewable energy and energy efficiency before \nactivities start at the country level. This document will demonstrate the relevant governments\u2019 \nwillingness and commitment to (i) give high priority to the TA and take ownership of its approach \nand methodology, (ii) designate a national implementation agency to coordinate TA activities, \n(iii)  constitute  a  high-level  TA  steering  committee  with  representation  from  all  relevant \nstakeholders, and (iv) provide counterpart staff and other inputs in kind.  \n \n14.  The TA activities are those required to achieve TA outputs as given in paragraph 12, \nplus, development of appropriate institutional arrangements, necessary regulatory and legal \nframework, and a system of financing schemes targeted at both private sector and household \nend-users. Details of key activities are given in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000. ADB will administer an amount of  \n$600,000 to be financed on a grant basis from the Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable \nEnergy  and  Energy  Efficiency  in  Rural  Areas.  The  two  participating  PDMCs  will  provide \n$150,000  equivalent  as  counterpart  financing.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing \narrangements are presented in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will be executed by ADB over an estimated 24-month period, to commence in \nJune 2003 and be completed by May 2005. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will be responsible for \noverall coordination of TA implementation, and the ADB\u2019s Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency \nand  Climate  Change  (REACH)  Committee  will  provide  advisory  guidance.  A  National \nimplementing agency will implement TA activities in each participating PDMC. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. \n \n18.  The inception phase (4 months) will include: (i) review of past and ongoing initiatives \nrelated to Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in the region (PIREP, PREFACE, PREGA, \netc);  (ii)  development  of  selection  criteria,  selection  of  the  two  participating  PDMCs,  and ", "    5\npreparation and Cabinet endorsement of a development policy letter on renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency; (iii) preparation of a pipeline of renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects for funding/cofinancing by ADB/GEF/CDM, and/or other sources, to follow up on the \noutcomes of this TA; (iv) in each participating PDMC, support for the identification of the \nnational  implementing  agency,  the  establishment  of  the    TA  steering  committee,  and  the \nselection of the national technical expert (NTE); and (v) preparation of and agree on detailed TA \nimplementation plans and work programs. Each PDMC selected to participate in the TA will \nhave confirmed in writing to ADB that it does not object to its participation in the TA, including to \nits participation to the financing of the TA as described in paragraph 15. \n \n19.  The main implementation phase (20 months) will include: (i) implementation of all key \nactivities listed in paragraph 14 and Appendix 2; (ii) proactive participation in  related national \nand regional workshops to disseminate information pertinent to renewable energy and energy \nefficiency, exchange of good practices and analytical work results, and collaboration on specific \nactivities; (iii) facilitation of continued financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects after TA completion; and (iv) by the end of TA implementation, dissemination of lessons \nlearned via a regional workshop and a non technical publication.   \n \n20.  TA implementation will be assisted by a team of international (17 person-months) and \ndomestic consultants (36 person-months), recruited through a consulting firm. The consultants \nwill include (i) one international technical expert, (the Team Leader) with expertise in renewable \nenergy  and  energy  efficiency  energy  policy  in  small  island  countries,  (ii)  two  short-term \ninternational technical experts, with expertise in developing financing models and designing and \nintroducing technical norms and certification schemes, and (iii) two national technical experts \n(NTEs),  18  person-months  per  PDMC  (36  person-months  total),  with  experience in rural, \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency energy projects. The two NTEs will be recruited after \nselection of the two participating PDMCs, and subject to ADB\u2019s approval. Staff from the national \nimplementing agencies will also support TA implementation. In addition, one assistant project \nmanager  (12  person-months),  with  expertise  in  energy,  environment,  and  managing  and \ncoordinating ADB TA projects will be recruited by ADB in the Philippines, to assist in overall \nproject management and implementation. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultants as well as \nreporting  requirements  are  presented  in  Appendix  4.  Given  the  innovative  approach, \nmethodology, and Terms of Reference, required for effective TA implementation, the consulting \nfirm will be selected through the full technical proposal and the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethods. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy \nEfficiency in Rural Areas for the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program for the \nPacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

Scope of Work \n1.  The Technical Assistance will be implemented by six consultants: one international \nconsultant (team leader); one domestic consultant locally recruited in the Philippines (assistant \nproject  manager);  two  domestic  consultants  (one  national  technical  expert  [NTE]  in  each \nparticipating  Pacific  developing  member  country  [PDMC]);  and  two  short-term  international \nconsultants (financial expert and norms and standards expert). The TA is divided in two phases: \ninception and implementation. Key TA activities are described in Appendix 2. \n \n2.  The international consultants will be responsible for all the outputs included in the Terms \nof  Reference  (TOR),  and  in  the  key  activities  listed  in  Appendix  2.  They  will  coordinate \npreparation and finalize (i) the inception report (including detailed TOR, activities, revised TA \nframework, TA reports outlines, and work plan) by the end of week 4; (i) the midterm report \n(including the stock taking report) by the end of month 8; (iii) the second midterm report by end \nof month 16; and (iii) the final report by the end of month 23. Report outlines will be discussed \nand  agreed  upon  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  TA  project  specialist  at  TA \nimplementation start-up. Outlines of the midterm reports and the final report will be agreed upon \nduring inception. \n \n3.  During the inception phase, the TA will primarily focus on five activities: (i) stocktaking of \nprior and ongoing initiatives related to renewable energy and energy efficiency in the region \n(Pacific Islands Renewable Energy Project, Pacific Rural Renewable Energy France-Australia \nCommon Endeavor, etc); (ii) develop selection criteria and select the two target PDMCs; (iii) \nassist the selected PDMCs to develop and issue a development policy letter on renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency; (iv) in close coordination with the existing country level energy \nprojects team (e.g. PIREP energy country team), establish  an effective project implementation \nstructure within the national implementing agency in each PDMC and develop detailed project \nimplementation plans and arrangements; (v) recruit the 2 NTEs for the two participating PDMCs, \nand (vi) identify and prepare an initial pipeline of appropriate renewable energy and energy \nefficiency projects for funding by ADB, Global Environmental Facility (GEF), Clean Development \nMechanism (CDM) and other funding sources. The inception phase will last for 4 months. In \nrelation to technology choices, a holistic approach should be adopted while avoiding any bias \ntoward solar photovoltaic, wind, biomass, grid extension, or any other particular technology. The \napplicable type of technology to meet this goal should be chosen freely from site to site, based \non a lifetime least-cost analysis that weighs all relevant technologies against each other, and \nwith  due  consideration  for  major  issues  such  as  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance \nmechanisms,  existing  and  planned  infrastructure;  financing  schemes  and  subsidies;  and \neconomic, environmental, and social impacts at both local, national, and global level. \n \n4.  The implementation phase (20 months) will include all the TA activities remaining to \nrealize  the  necessary  set  of  policies  and  workable  delivery  mechanisms  for  providing \ncommercially viable rural energy services. Further, in preparing the projects pipeline for funding \nby  ADB/GEF/CDM  and  other  sources,  the  TA  will,  within  the  first  few  months  of  the \nimplementation phase, produce concept papers and Project Development Financing-Block B \nproposals for such projects. The succeeding ADB/GEF/CDM funded projects are to tentatively \ncommence 3-4 months prior to termination of the TA, which will allow a period of parallel \noperation, with synchronization and handing-over of lessons learned. Sustainability of project \noutputs is further secured via a workshop by the end of the TA period.  \n \n5.  TA implementation will be assisted by a team of international (17 person-months) and \ndomestic (36 person-months) consultants, recruited through a consulting firm, and consisting of ", "  Appendix 4  17\n(i) one international technical expert (ITE), team leader, with expertise in renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency policy in small island countries, institutional arrangements, regulatory and \nlegal frameworks, and private sector participation; (ii) two short-term ITEs, with expertise in \ndeveloping financing models and designing and introducing technical norms and certification \nschemes; and (iii) two NTEs, (18 person-months per PDMC, 36 person-months total), with  \nexperience  in  rural  energy,  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  projects  and \ncomprehensive knowledge of relevant national policies, institutional arrangements, and private \nsector aspects. The two NTEs will be recruited after selection of the two participating PDMCs, \nand subject to ADB\u2019s approval.  Staff from the implementing agencies will also support TA \nimplementation. In addition, one assistant project manager (12 person-months), with expertise \nin energy, environment, and managing and coordinating ADB TA projects will be recruited by \nADB  in  the  Philippines  to  assist  in  overall  TA  management  and  coordination  of  TA \nimplementation. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Given the level of innovativeness required for effective TA implementation, with \nrespect to approach, methodology and TORs, the consulting firm selection process will follow \nthe full technical proposal and the quality- and cost-based selection methods. \n \nB.
