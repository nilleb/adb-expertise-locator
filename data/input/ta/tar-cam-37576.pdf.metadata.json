But they can also alter water quantity, quality, and timing; modify flooding patterns; \ninduce  loss  of  habitat;  affect  fishery  resources  by  blocking  fish  migration  and  access  to \nspawning areas; and ultimately impact communities that depend on natural, especially aquatic, \nresources. On 29\u201331 August 2005, a Fact-Finding Mission of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) visited Cambodia to formulate this technical assistance (TA), in line with the program of \nactions formalized in the poverty partnership agreement between the Government and ADB and \nin ADB's Tonle Sap Basin2 Strategy.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Tonle  Sap  ecosystem  is  the  permanent  core  area  of  the  Tonle  Sap  and  its \nfloodplains, which lie within boundaries formed by the upper flood lines. It includes the Tonle \nSap River, its branches, and floodplains. The Tonle Sap ecosystem is (i) the main source of \nanimal protein for much of the population of Cambodia because of the fishery resources of the \nTonle Sap, (ii) a direct and irreplaceable source of livelihood for more than 1 million people \nliving on and around the Tonle Sap, (iii) a seasonal breeding and nursery ground and forage \narea for fish that migrate to the Mekong River, and (iv) an environmental hot spot of global \nsignificance. The Tonle Sap basin covers 85,000 square kilometers (km2), of which 80,000 km2 \nlie  in  Cambodia.  It  extends  over  44%  of  Cambodia's  land  area  and  is  home  to  32%  of \nCambodia's population, or about 3.6 million people (1998 figure). It is a reservoir from which \nwater drains in the dry season to control salinity and conserve mangrove in the Mekong delta. \n \n3.  The fishery resources of the Tonle Sap rank first in the world for their productivity5 and \nfourth for their total catch6 despite the small size of the country. The Tonle Sap ecosystem \ncontributes 60% of this boon with the most productive floodplains worldwide.7 The floodplains' \ncontribution to income, employment, and food security is higher than in any other country. With \nthe  rising  demand  for  high-value  freshwater  fish  in  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam,  their  fishery \nresources are becoming a significant source of foreign exchange. The natural productivity of the \nTonle Sap's floodplains will decline if the flood pulse, the temporarily submerged habitats, and \nthe migration routes of the Tonle Sap are not given attention. In relation to this, the influence of \nbuilt structures needs to be better assessed at the ecological and socioeconomic levels. The TA \nwill complement the suite of loan and TA projects that ADB promotes under the Tonle Sap \n                                                 \n1  These can be classified as structures that (i) oppose water outflow, e.g., dams, weirs, irrigation schemes, levees, \nand embankments; (ii) prevent water inflow, e.g., roads, flood control works, polders, colmatage canal systems, \ndykes, reclaimed urban and industrial areas, railways, wharves, and quays; (iii) alter water inflow or outflow, e.g., \ndrainage canals, diversion structures, agricultural works such as rice field dikes, bank modifications such as the \nChaktomuk peninsula extension and, in the case of the Tonle Sap, fishing gears that are set on a massive scale, \nalter hydrological flows and obstruct fish movements; and (iv) degrade water quality, e.g., plants with aqueous \neffluents, mining and mineral processing facilities, petroleum storage facilities, sewerage systems, and dredgers. \n2  The Tonle Sap basin is, strictly speaking, a subbasin of the Mekong River basin. However, in conformity with \ninternational practice for a system of this magnitude, the term Tonle Sap basin is used in this report. The \ncatchments of the individual tributaries that flow directly into its lake are referred to as subbasins. \n3  ADB. 2005. The Tonle Sap Basin Strategy. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 4 April 2005. \n5  The catch per fisher amounts to 20 kilograms (kg) per person per year (compared with 4.5 kg/person/year in \nBangladesh and 0.5 kg/person/year in India). The natural productivity of the Tonle Sap's floodplains ranges from \n130 kg to 230 kg per hectare per year, which is a world record. \n6  Research suggests that production ranges from 290,000 tons to 430,000 tons per year. \n7  High biodiversity qualified the ecosystem as a biosphere reserve in 1997. \n ", "2 \nInitiative.8 The TA's findings and recommendations are intended to find expression in the Tonle \nSap Initiative. They can also inform ADB's recent work on cumulative impact assessment. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The impact of the TA will be sound management and conservation of natural resources \nand biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. Its outcome will be improved awareness of the influence \nof built structures on the lake's hydrology. Six accomplishments will achieve the TA's outcome: \n(i)  a  database  of  built  structures  will  be  created,  (ii)  the  impact  of  built  structures  on \nhydrodynamics and water quality will be modeled, (iii) the influence of built structures on the \nenvironment will be assessed, (iv) the influence of built structures on fishery resources will be \nassessed, (v) the influence of built structures on livelihood will be assessed, and (vi) policy \nmakers and decision makers will be informed. The principal deliverable from the TA will be \nguidelines recommending approaches, methods, and processes so that the design, number, \nand  operation  of  built  structures  can  maximize  economic  returns  from  investments  in \ninfrastructure development without impacting environmental sustainability or the communities \nthat depend on the Tonle Sap. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n5.  The methodology of the TA will combine fish bioecology, socioeconomics, livelihood \nanalysis,  hydrodynamic  modeling,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  database \nconstruction and management. The results will be synthesized and combined into clear-cut \npolicy briefs in the English and Khmer languages targeting policy makers and decision makers. \nThe TA will be embedded within the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) Secretariat in the \nCambodia National Mekong Committee9 (CNMC) to ensure the best possible uptake of lessons \nlearned. Collaboration with its key members, as well as the Inland Fisheries Research and \nDevelopment Institute (IFREDI), is also intrinsic to the methodology. Activities will also rely on \nand create synergies with other operating outputs of the Tonle Sap Initiative, the Mekong River \nCommission (MRC), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The TA's \nmultidisciplinary approach will lean on surveys in four study sites. \n \n1.  Creating a Database of Built Structures \n6.  Built structures are, by default, any human construction. But not every built structure that \ninfluences the free flow of water and aquatic organisms deserves consideration. This output will \nassess built structures of concern. Key activities will include (i) conducting a scoping study on \nbuilt structures, aimed at defining built structures of relevance for cataloguing, specifying the \nbuilt structures of concern, and defining the limits of the study; (ii) gathering existing information \non  built  structures  of  concern  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin\u2014the  existing  data  includes \northophotomaps  prepared  under  the  ADB-assisted  Tonle  Sap  Environmental  Management \n                                                 \n8  The Tonle Sap Initiative is a partnership of organizations and people working to meet the poverty-environment \nchallenge of the Tonle Sap. Details are at http://www.adb.org/Projects/Tonle_Sap/. \n9  CNMC's mandate is to assist and advise the Government in all matters related to the formulation of water policy, \nstrategy, management, preservation, investigation, planning, restoration, and the development of the water and \nother natural resources of the Mekong River basin within Cambodia. CNMC is chaired by the Minister of Water \nResources and Meteorology. \n ", "    3 \nProject,10 MRC data on projected infrastructure development, and information from the World \nBank-assisted  Land  Management  and  Administration  Project;  (iii)  ground-truthing  built \nstructures of concern in selected locations; and (iv) producing a database of the characteristics \nof built structures of concern.11 \n \n2.  Modeling the Impact of Built Structures on Hydrodynamics \n    and Water Quality \n \n7.  Given the large variability of natural conditions and processes, it is difficult to measure \ndirectly  the  impacts  of  all  built  structures  of  concern.  This  output  will  apply  mathematical \nmodeling as the only feasible option. Mathematical modeling is now common for environmental \nmanagement and the 3D hydrodynamic and water quality model developed for the Tonle Sap \nbasin under the Water Utilization Program-Finland (WUP-FIN)12 Phase I (2001\u20132003) will be \nused.13 The model's resolution of 1 kilometer can give an overall picture of medium to large \nimpacts, but a more detailed study will be needed for local impacts and to bridge the gap \nbetween hydrology, hydrodynamics, water quality, and fish habitat. Key activities will include (i) \nintegrating large-scale built structures, at the basin level, into the Tonle Sap hydrodynamic and \nwater quality model;14 (ii) integrating small-scale built structures, if possible at the basin level, \ninto the Tonle Sap hydrodynamic and water quality model;15 (iii) assessing the impact of major \nfishing  gears16  on  hydrodynamics,  integrating  major  fishing  gears  in  the  Tonle  Sap \nhydrodynamic and water quality model, and quantifying their impact on fish migration; and (iv) \nconducting quantitative analysis of hydrodynamic and water quality differences with and without \nbuilt structures.17 \n \n3.  Assessing the Influence of Built Structures on the Environment \n8.  This output will assess the side-effects of built structures of concern on the environment. \nIt will streamline information at two levels to assess possible cumulative impacts. Key activities \nwill include (i) reviewing the documented short-term and long-term influence of built structures in \ntropical  floodplains  worldwide,  from  environmental  and  social  safeguard  perspectives;  (ii) \nsynthesizing the findings and recommendations from environmental impact assessments (EIAs) \nand initial environmental examinations (IEEs) conducted for development projects in the Tonle \nSap basin, from environmental and social safeguard perspectives; and (iii) identifying gaps in \nthe approaches, methods, and processes followed by EIAs and IEEs in the Tonle Sap basin. \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nCambodia for the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project. Manila. \n11 The database will be used to model the impact of built structures on hydrodynamics and water quality and assess \ntheir influence on the environment, fishery resources, and livelihood. \n12 WUP-FIN is a flexible consortium centering on the Finnish Environment Institute, the Environmental Impact \nAssessment Center of Finland, and the Helsinki University of Technology. \n13 WUP-FIN Phase I (2001\u20132003) and Phase II (2004\u20132006) complement the Water Utilization Program of the \nMekong River Commission (MRC). Phase I created means to understand physical, chemical, and biological \nprocesses in the Tonle Sap. Phase II aims to expand the experience to other subbasins in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. It focuses on integrating hydrodynamic and socioeconomic data, tools, and results into MRC's decision \nsupport framework, training associated staff members of MRC and the national Mekong committees, estimating \nenvironmental and socioeconomic impacts of development projects, and devising ways to mitigate harmful effects. \n14 Large-scale structures include dams, roads, weirs, and flood control works. \n15 Small-scale structures impacts have to be parameterized in the model's 1-kilometer grid scale. \n16 There are over 200 types of gear in use on the Tonle Sap. Large-scale gear includes barrage traps, dai (bagnets), \nand arrow-shaped traps. \n17 The impacts will be calculated for dry, wet, and average flood cycles and the results cast into a form that can be \neasily used to assess the influence of built structures on fishery resources and disseminate lessons learned. \n ", "4 \n4.  Assessing the Influence of Built Structures on Fishery Resources \n9.  This output will assess the influence of built structures on fishery resources based on a \ncomparative approach (i.e., built versus pristine sites). It will be based on identification of the \nmain guilds of fish species that have similar responses to hydrological and environmental \nmodifications.18 Given the time constraint (half a biological cycle), field studies will rely primarily \non traditional ecological knowledge gathered in selected study sites in coordination with output \n5. The information gathered will be combined with output 2 and integrated into the BayFish \nTonle Sap model developed by the WorldFish Center and IFREDI19 to assess the response of \nfish to changes driven by built structures and weigh the influence of these structures vis-\u00e0-vis \nother independent parameters. Key activities will include (i) surveying local knowledge of the \ninfluence of built structures on fish production and species ecology in four study sites; (ii) \ncombining fish ecology data and the changes in hydrology and water quality predicted by the \nTonle Sap hydrodynamic and water quality model, with emphasis on large-scale fishing gears; \n(iii) integrating output 2 into the BayFish Tonle Sap model and forecasting the impacts of \nhydrological changes on fishery resources; and (iv) quantifying, based on available information, \nthe influence of built structures on fishery resources. \n \n5.  Assessing the Influence of Built Structures on Livelihood \n10.  Building on outputs 3 and 4, output 5 will conduct a livelihood analysis focusing on \ncommunities  that  depend  most  on  aquatic  resources.  This  output  will  consider  first-order \nimpacts, namely (i) changes in resource access by different social groups; (ii) diet (including \nseasonal variation); and (iii) income, and, if feasible, second-order impacts such as conflict over \nfishery resources.20 Key activities will include (i) reviewing the main consequences of built \nstructures on the livelihood of fish-dependent communities in tropical floodplains worldwide; (ii) \nconducting participatory rural appraisal, distributing open-ended questionnaires, and conducting \nkey-informant interviews21 in four study sites directly affected by built structures and in one \npristine study site; (iii) assessing the possible influence of built structures on the livelihood of \nTonle Sap communities; and (iv) probing the availability of alternative livelihood to assess the \nextent to which the loss of one source of income or food can be replaced given the local \necological and economic context. \n \n6.  Informing Policy Makers and Decision Makers \n11.  Building on outputs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, output 6 will synthesize all lessons learned and \nmake them accessible to a large audience. Key activities will include (i) preparing policy briefs; \n(ii)  preparing  guidelines  on  the  design,  number,  and  operation  of built  structures;  and  (iii) \ndisseminating the policy briefs and guidelines.22 \n                                                 \n18 This analysis is made possible by tools recently developed by FishBase at the WorldFish Center. \n19  This is a model of fish production developed under ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia \nfor Capacity Building of the Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute. Manila (TA 4025\u2013CAM). \n20 Conflict has escalated in recent years as more compete over a limited resource. Its forms have been protests, \narrests, petitions, confiscation of fishing gear, injuries, and killings of fisherfolk and fisheries officers. All are widely \nreported in the media. They occurred because of (i) different interpretations of the boundaries of fishing lots, \ncommunity lots, and public access areas; (ii) conversion of the flooded forest for other uses (e.g., rice cultivation) \nby the villagers; (iii) illegal fishing operations by lot operators and villagers; and (iv) competing uses of water for \nfishing and irrigation. \n21  Informants will include fisheries authorities, nongovernment organizations, and fishing lot owners. The participatory \nrural appraisals and open-ended questionnaires will target the villagers, particularly fishers, living in the study sites. \nThe analyses will incorporate the perceptions that informants have of built structures. \n22 Early during TA implementation, the resource specialists will formulate a dissemination policy, a dissemination \nplan, a dissemination strategy, and dissemination tactics. Advice on linking research to practice is provided at \nhttp://www.adb.org/Projects/Tonle_Sap/. \n ", "    5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, comprising foreign exchange of \n$585,000 and local currency equivalent of $315,000. The Government has requested financing \non a grant basis of $765,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and local \ncurrency cost of $180,000 equivalent. The Government will finance the remaining local currency \ncost  of  $135,000  equivalent.  The  TA  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  of  Finland  and \nadministered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  CNMC, through its TSBR Secretariat, will act as Executing Agency. The TA is expected \nto begin in March 2006 and to be completed by end-December 2006. The WorldFish Center will \nbe selected directly to implement the TA. With its experience, capacity, and commitment, it is \nthe most qualified and competent agency to provide the required services. The Mekong region \nis one of the Center's priority regions and Cambodia is one of its priority countries. The Center \nhas a regional office in Cambodia and has collaboration arrangements with IFREDI. It has a \ngood track record in implementing several operating outputs of the Tonle Sap Initiative. The \nWorldFish Center will subcontract resource specialist services to WUP-FIN as required. \n \n14.  TA implementation will require (i) 34 person-months of international resource specialists, \nmainly in the fields of fish bioecology, socioeconomics, and hydrological modeling, and (ii) 39 \nperson-months of short-term domestic resource specialists, mainly in the same fields. The \nmethodology, key activities, and terms of reference for the TA are specific and clearly identified. \nHence,  ADB's  procedures  for  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  used  as  the  basis  for \ncontract negotiation with the WorldFish Center. The resource specialists will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The fisheries bioecologist will act \nas  team  leader  and  coordinate,  supervise,  and  monitor  their  activities.  Equipment  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The staffing schedule is shown \nin Appendix 3. Terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n15.  The resource specialists will operate from the regional office of the WorldFish Center in \nPhnom Penh. At the WorldFish Center, a project coordination office headed by a WorldFish \nCenter representative and including experts in natural resources, socioeconomics, and policy \ndevelopment will be established to advise on TA implementation and coordinate with the TSBR \nSecretariat and ADB. The TSBR Secretariat will give the WorldFish Center and ADB access to \nrelevant data and information. At ADB, a project officer with suitable expertise will be assigned \nto administer the TA and monitor its progress. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $765,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland for the Study of the \nInfluence of Built Structures on the Fisheries of the Tonle Sap, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Risk \nSound management and  \u2022  Development of built  \u2022  Policy statements  \u2022  The cumulative impact \nconservation of natural  structures in the  \u2022  Project design  of built structures in \nresources and biodiversity  Tonle Sap ecosystem  summaries  the Mekong River \nin the Tonle Sap basin  is better driven,  \u2022  Research program  basin could disrupt the \ncoordinated, and  publications  Tonle Sap ecosystem. \nstreamlined.  \u2022  Funding for further   \nresearch \n\u2022  Government statistics \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved awareness of  \u2022  Guidelines on the  \u2022  Technical assistance  \u2022  CNMC and its key \nthe influence of built  number, design, and  (TA) design and  members understand \nstructures on the lake's  operation of built  monitoring framework  clearly what the impact \nhydrology  structures are  \u2022  Final report of the  of the TA is expected \n  formulated to  resource specialists  to be. \nmaximize economic  \u2022  TA completion  \u2022  CNMC and its \nreturns from  questionnaire filled out  members, with support \ninvestments in  by the Cambodia  from the aid \ninfrastructure  National Mekong  community, apply the \ndevelopment without  Committee (CNMC)  guidelines on the \nimpacting  \u2022  TA completion report  number, design, and \nenvironmental  prepared by the Asian  operation of built \nsustainability or the  Development Bank  structures. \ncommunities that  (ADB)   \ndepend on the Tonle \nSap. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
