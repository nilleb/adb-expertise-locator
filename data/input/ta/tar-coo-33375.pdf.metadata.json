The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recently provided assistance to the Government of \nthe Cook Islands to help improve the environment of the country. Advisory technical assistance \n(TA) for the legal and institutional dimensions of environmental management is included in \nADB\u2019s 2003 nonlending program for the Cook Islands as a response to the Government request \nfor the TA.1 The TA will promote coordinated implementation of the new Environment Act \napproved in November 2003. A Fact-Finding mission visited the Cook Islands 8\u221217 July 2002 and \nheld consultations with Government officials and other stakeholders. The Government and the \nMission  reached  full  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  and  the  implementation \narrangements of the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Cook Islands comprises 15 small volcanic islands and coral atolls with a total land \narea of 240 square kilometers (km2) dispersed over an ocean area of 1.8 million km2. The \npopulation is estimated at about 17,000, with the southern group islands having twice as many \npeople as the northern group. The principal island, Rarotonga, is only 6 km in diameter and has \na resident population of about 10,000. The second most populous island group is the atoll of \nAitutaki with a resident population of about 2,000 people. To the resident population must be \nadded the increasing number of tourists, which in 2000 reached a peak of nearly 73,000.  \n \n3.   The country\u2019s economy is dominated by tourism and pearl production. In view of the \ncountry\u2019s  vulnerability  and  dependence  on  an  attractive  environment,  special  attention  is \nneeded to protect the environment and ensure that economic development is environmentally \nsustainable.  Increasing  environmental  pollution  caused  by  lack  of  appropriate  solid  waste \nmanagement and adequate sanitation arrangements is beginning to adversely affect tourism \ndevelopment. Coastal area degradation and erosion are another area of concern as they have \ncaused serious problems to the local environment. An ADB-funded Waste Management Project \n(approved in June 2001) will provide sustainable waste management services in Rarotonga and \nAitutaki and effectively address solid waste management in these two major islands. However, \nmost of the remaining environmental issues require urgent attention and the establishment of an \neffective institutional and legal framework for environmental management. \n \n4.  In  this  context,  Environment  Act  2003,  passed  on  17  November  2003,  provides \ncomprehensive national legislation for the protection, conservation, and management of the \nenvironment in a sustainable manner. Among other things, the Act extends environmental \nmanagement  to  the  outer  islands  and  provides  for  the  establishment  of  an  appropriate \ninstitutional structure and an effective regulatory and enforcement/compliance framework for \nenvironmental management. The Act repeals the Rarotonga Environment Act 1994\u22121995 and is \na comprehensive piece of legislation covering the:  (i) composition, functions, and powers of the \nnew central environmental body;2 (ii) establishment, functions, and working provisions for the \nisland environment committees; (iii) functions and powers of the National Environment Service \n(NES) or Tu\u2019anga Taporoporo as well as powers, additional powers, and responsibilities of the \nenvironment officers; (iv) principles, roles, and procedures for introducing an environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) system; (v) principles and powers for establishing protected areas, \nadopting  related  resource  management  agreements,  and  preparing  and  approving  of \nmanagement  plans;  (vi)  principles,  processes,  and  penalties  for  solid  waste  management \n                                                 \n1    The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 23 August 1999. \n2   Composed of the environment minister, environment councils in each island, and the Environment Service. \n ", "2    \nincluding  responsibilities  for  designating  waste  disposal  areas  (e.g.,  control  of  litter);  (vii) \nprovisions  covering  specific  areas of  concern  (protection of  coastal areas,  water  pollution, \nprotection of endangered species, hazardous wastes, wetlands etc.); and  (viii) other provisions \n(penalties, pollution levies, Environment Protection Fund, registration of nongovernment [NGOs] \norganizations (NGOs), Environmental Forum, etc.). \n \n5.  To  become  fully  operational,  the  Act  requires  the  promulgation  or  adoption  of  a \nsubstantial body of new regulations and bylaws, including outer island bylaws. Priority areas \nmay include (i) operational guidelines for authorities and responsibilities of the line agencies; (ii) \nenforcement  procedures  and  compliance  regimes  including  penalties;  (iii)  guidelines  and \nprocedures for the EIA system including screening, scoping, preparing and reviewing project \nEIAs; (iv) procedures for issuing permits; (v) incorporation in the new legislative framework of \ntraditional/customary  environmental  practices;  (vi)  processes  and  responsibilities  for  public \nreview  and  participation,  including  by  NGOs;  (vii)  adoption  of  economic  incentives  and \nenvironmental taxes (such as the pollution levy in the Act); (viii) procedures for designating \nprotected  areas;  (ix)  operation  of  the  Environment  Protection  Fund;  and  (x)  the  purpose, \nmembership, processes and mandate of a Cook Islands Environmental Forum which is required \nto be convened within 1 year after the Act comes into force.  \n \n6.  In the Cook Islands, responsibility for managing the environment is now divided among \nseveral government (including outer island government) ministries, agencies, and councils.3 \nContingent on approval of the Act, the Government requested ADB to assist with a review of \nenacted  and  proposed  sector  legislation4  to  improve  intersectoral  coordination  among  all \nministries  and  line  agencies  with  environmental  responsibilities.  The  coordination  role  in \nformulating new and revising existing legislation lies with the Crown Law Office.  \n \n7.  Stemming  from  this  legislative  review,  appropriate  amendments  will  be  drafted \n(Appendix 2). The final objective is to properly distribute responsibilities among the sectoral \nagencies,  especially  with  regard  to  compliance  with  and  enforcement  of  the  Act  and  its \nassociated  regulations  and  bylaws.  The  intended  outcomes  are  (i)  institutional  reform  for \nimproved  and  integrated  environmental  management,  and  (ii)  establishment  of  appropriate \ninstitutional  mechanisms  for  facilitating  compliance  with  regulations  and  achieving  more \neffective enforcement of environmental legislation.  \n  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The main purpose of the TA is to assist the Government in developing an integrated \nsystem of regulations, bylaws and laws that together will provide the institutional mechanisms \nfor the effective and coordinated implementation of Environment Act 2003. The focus is on \nformulating appropriate regulations and bylaws to facilitate compliance and enforcement, and \nthe review of legislation that may now require amendment as a result of the enactment of the \nAct. Key outputs will include \n \n                                                 \n3   For instance, the ministries/departments of health, marine resources, tourism, agriculture, works, transport, \njustice, outer islands administration, police, national disaster management, cultural development, education.  \n4   Various pieces of legislation are in the process of being finalized for various sectors, including the following \namong others: health, marine resources, agriculture (biosafety and quarantine services).   ", "      3\n(i)  promulgation and adoption of a suite of core environmental regulations, bylaws, \nand monitoring and compliance guidelines and procedures5 required for effective \nenvironmental management and institutional coordination under Environment Act \n2003; \n \n(ii)  formulation  of  a  training  and  community  awareness-raising  program  for \nenvironmental management consisting of a series of professional environmental \ntraining  modules  for  both  central  Government  and  the  islands  environment \ncommittees\u2019 staff,6 and the wider community; \n \n(iii)  review of sectoral legislation7 that may need to be revised to ensure overall \ncoherence,  and  incorporation  in  a  report  of  recommendations  for  their \nimprovement  and  amendment  to  meet  the  objectives  of  updating  the \nenvironmental management system in the country; \n \n(iv)  new and revised operational guidelines, and detailed institutional mechanisms \napplicable  to  NES,  the  island  environment  committees,  and  other  agencies/ \nadministrations involved in implementing the new environmental legislation;   \n \n(v)  an action plan to effectively follow up legislative reform in accordance with the \nstakeholders consensus (achieved through participatory workshops); \n \n(vi)  improved interagency and institutional coordination for effective environmental \nmanagement  (including  recommended  institutional  responsibilities  and \ncoordination among the agencies including NES and the Crown Law Office); and  \n \n(vii)  improved capacity of all stakeholders including officials of government agencies \nor permitting authorities, communities, and NGOs to contribute to the overall \nlegislative process, and other TA-related activities.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Preparing and finalizing the outputs will involve the following activities: \n   \n(i)  After  identifying  and  selecting  priority  areas,8  prepare  a  core  system  of \nenvironmental regulations, bylaws, monitoring and compliance procedures, and \nguidelines. \n \n(ii)  Prepare  a  set  of  new  and  revised  operational  guidelines,  procedures  and \ninstitutional mechanisms for effective implementation of environmental legislation \nand efficient operation of environmental institutions at both central and islands \nlevels. \n                                                 \n5   To be formally approved as regulations and bylaws by the Executive Council. \n6   The  program  will  be  prepared  for  future  implementation.  The  training  program  will  include  more  general \nenvironmental education material and awareness raising on new environmental legislation and institutional set up. \nA Human Resource Development training manual for the Tu\u2019anga Taporoporo produced from previous South \nPacific Regional Environment Programme in-country activity will be used under the TA project.  \n7   Sectors that have potentially conflicting environmental provisions include health, marine resources, tourism, \nagriculture, works, transport, outer islands administration, police, disaster management, and others. \n8   Areas requiring regulations will be prioritized during the TA inception stage, using the results of an inception \nworkshop (see Appendix 2 for a list of regulations referred to in the Act). \n ", "4    \n \n(iii)  After reviewing existing and draft sectoral legislation that have environmental \nimplications,  identify  and  recommend  appropriate  legislative  amendments  to \nimprove  consistency,  avoid  a  fragmented  legal  framework,  and  prevent \ninstitutional conflicts and jurisdictional overlaps.  \n \n(iv)  Prepare  an  action  plan  to  guide  the  implementation  of  TA  findings  and \nrecommendations as confirmed by the final national workshop. The purpose of \nthe action plan is to continue carrying out required legislation revisions, and \ninstitutional reforms to achieve the intended medium- and long-term objectives. \n \n(v)  Review interagency and institutional coordination in environmental management \nto  identify  and  formulate  better  institutional  arrangements  and  coordination \namong concerned agencies. \n \n(vi)  Undertake  training  workshops  for  stakeholders  to  strengthen  their  active \nparticipation in the legislative process and other TA-related activities.  \n \n(vii)  Prepare training modules and environmental education materials for professional \ntraining, capacity building, and environmental awareness-raising activities.  \n \n(viii)  Organize two national workshops: (a) an inception workshop at the start of TA \nimplementation to discuss scope (including priority areas that urgently need to be  \ncovered by regulations), objectives, and expected outcomes of the TA; and (b) a \nfinal national workshop to present the outputs and recommendations of the TA \nand agree on the plan for implementing the TA outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000 equivalent, with $217,000 in foreign exchange and \n$223,000 equivalent in local currency (Appendix 3). The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance  $350,000  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  ($217,000)  and \n$133,000 equivalent of the local currency cost to cover the costs of the consultants, training, \nreports, international and local travel, and associated miscellaneous costs and contingencies. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \ncontribute $90,000 equivalent by providing counterpart staff, office space, administration and \ncommunications, office supplies and materials, media information material, and data.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  NES and the Crown Law Office will be joint Executing Agencies (EAs), with the director of \nNES  and  the  solicitor  general  as  comanagers  of  the  Project.  Each  EA  will  designate  a \ncounterpart staff who will work with the consultants to facilitate transfer of skills and knowledge \nand to closely coordinate TA implementation between the two EAs. A steering committee will be \nestablished to provide appropriate strategic guidance and review TA progress. The steering \ncommittee will be chaired by the Solicitor General and include as members the secretaries and \ndirectors  of  NES,  finance,  justice,  health,  marine  resources,  tourism,  agriculture,  works, \ntransports,  outer  islands  administrations,  police,  national  disaster  management,  cultural \ndevelopment, and Education. In addition, the chamber of commerce, the House of Ariki and the ", "      5\nKoutu Nui9 will be represented with one member each. The steering committee will meet at least \nthree times to discuss the (i) implementation plan (inception report), (ii) midterm report, and (iii) \ndraft final report. Additional meetings will be organized as necessary. NES will provide the \nsecretariat for the EAs and regularly report progress to the minister of environment and the \nsolicitor general of the Crown Law Office. NES and the Crown Law Office will provide office \nspace for the consultants doing work with them.  \n \n12.   Various NGOs and other interested parties have participated in the debate leading to \nthe Act. These organizations as well as central Government and outer islands institutional and \nother stakeholders will be consulted throughout TA implementation. This process will include a \nnational inception workshop and a national final workshop.  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, beginning in April 2004 with completion in \nJune 2005. The TA will finance the services of an international consulting firm consisting of a \nteam  of  5  experts  (2  international  and  3  domestic)  for  a  total  of  23  person-months.  The \ninternational consultants (person-months in parentheses) will comprise (i) a law draftsman/legal-\ncum-institution specialist/team leader (7), with expertise in legal drafting, the interpretation and \napplication  of  legislation,  and  policy  development  generally.  Experience  in  working  on \nenvironmental matters particularly in a developing country context, will be an advantage. The \nteam  leader  will  work  intermittently,  i.e.,  during  early,  middle,  and  last  phases  of  TA \nimplementation), and (ii) an environmental training specialist (1) to be recruited during the \nmiddle part of TA implementation. The domestic consultants (person-months in parentheses) \nwill be an expert in green sector issues, particularly natural resource management (5), an expert \nin brown sector issues, particularly urban, infrastructure, and waste management (5), and a \nsocial  development  specialist  with  experience  in  community  participation  (5),  all  on  an \nintermittent basis. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are attached as Appendix 4. \nADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consulting \nfirm will be selected through the simple technical proposal and the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method.  Equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. \n \n14.  The following reports will be produced: (i) an inception report at the end of week 4,  (ii) a \nmidterm report including draft regulations at the end of the month 8, (iii) a draft final report 4 \nweeks before TA completion, and (iv) a final report upon completion of the TA. The consultants \nwill submit adequate copies of all reports to ADB, NES, and the Crown Law Office.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands for Legal and Institutional Strengthening of Environmental \nManagement, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n9  The House of Ariki is composed by the traditional high chiefs from across the Cook Islands.
