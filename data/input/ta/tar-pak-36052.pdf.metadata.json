INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2002 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of Pakistan requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare a road development \nsector project in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding Mission visited \nthe  project  area  in  March  2003;  carried  out  an  initial  social  assessment;  and  discussed \neconomic,  social,  and  Project-specific  issues  with  officials  of  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments.  This  report  is  based  on  the  understanding  reached  with  the  Government \nconcerning  the  objectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  cost,  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update \n(CSPU) for 2002.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Poverty. In Pakistan2 the incidence of poverty increased from 26.6% in FY1993 to \n32.2%  in  FY1999.  During  that  period,  the  number  of  poor  increased  by  12  million.  This \nunfavorable development coincided with the onset of the macroeconomic crisis in FY1997 and \nthe slowdown in economic growth during that period. Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon in \nPakistan, and about 77% or 108 million people live in rural areas of the total population of 140 \nmillion. Rural poverty rose sharply in the 1990s, and in FY1999 its incidence (36.3%) was \nsignificantly higher than urban poverty (22.6%). With a population of close to 20 million, NWFP \nis one of the poorest provinces in Pakistan; currently 31% of the urban and 47% of the rural \npopulation live below the poverty line \u2013 far higher than the national average.3 ADB is actively \nengaged in policy dialogue with the Government on poverty reduction and related issues. The \npoverty focus is emphasized in the CSPU for 2002; the poverty partnership agreement between \nthe Federal Government and ADB was signed in 2002. \n \n3.  Programs  to  Reduce  Poverty.  The  Government  is,  inter  alia,  prioritizing  critical \ninfrastructure development, including rehabilitation of roads, to reduce poverty. This follows from \nthe international experience that road transport often plays an important role in the income \ngeneration and redistribution process with direct effects, such as providing basic access to \neducation, health, and markets and improving access to social and economic opportunities, \nincluding labor and product markets, schools, and clinics. Road transport also contributes to \nempowerment of the poor, enabling their participation in community and wider decision making, \nand  overcoming  social,  cultural,  and  physical  barriers,  including  geographical  isolation. \nAdequate road transport makes it possible for constituents to get to meeting places and town \ncenters,  and  facilitates  the  flow  of  information,  thereby  increasing  political  and  social \nparticipation. \n \n4.  Road Access and Connectivity.  NWFP has a road network of approximately 14,000 \nkilometers (km)4, which represents about 5.6% of the total road network of 249,959 km in \nPakistan.5 NWFP is landlocked, as the country\u2019s only port is over 1,500 km away to the south. \nMajor parts of the road network in NWFP are in very poor condition.6 These major physical \nconstraints  reduce  the  prospects  for  pro-poor  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction. \nAccording to the initial poverty and social analysis (Appendix 1), the limited road access and \n                                                 \n1  This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 27 December 2002. \n2  Pakistan is a federation of four provinces -  Balochistan, North-West Frontier Province, Punjab, and Sindh; two \nfederally administrated areas (Federally Administrated Northern Areas and the Federally Administrated Tribal \nAreas); and the federal capital area of Islamabad. \n3  Source: Federal Bureau of Statistics (2001). \n4  Of which 8,845 km is paved and 4,185 km is unpaved (shingle). This excludes 1,414 km of national highways \nadministered by the National Highways Authority. \n5  Of which 105,000 km is paved. \n6  NWFP comprises 24 districts, each headed by a nazim and supported by a district administration. \n ", " 2\npoor condition of the road network also affect the poor by preventing or reducing access to \nmarkets, education and health facilities, and other social opportunities. \n \n5.  Subregional  Transport  and  Cooperation.    Because  of  its  location,  Pakistan,  in \nparticular NWFP is well placed to act as a hub for subregional transport and cooperation, by \nmore  effectively  and  closely  linking  landlocked  Afghanistan,  Central  Asia,  and  Pakistan. \nNational Highway No. 5 (NH5)7 traverses NWFP and links Pakistan with Afghanistan and its \ncapital, Kabul. NH5 is increasingly being used as a transit route for the landlocked countries in \nCentral Asia and Afghanistan, offering access to major parts of Pakistan including Islamabad \nand Lahore as well as ports in Gwadar and Karachi. While both intraregional and interregional \ntrade are expected to increase during the coming years, partly because of the reconstruction of \ncritical infrastructure in Afghanistan, improved trade facilitation and streamlined cross-border \narrangements along with rehabilitation and expansion of the road network will be important to \nmeet the expected increase in transport demand, particularly for freight. This would place \nconsiderable pressure on the existing road network in NWFP, which is already in poor condition. \nIncreased trade, facilitation, and transit traffic will also raise the incomes of the rural poor \nresiding along the major transit routes in NWFP, such as national and provincial highways, and \nwill provide better access to economic opportunities as well as education, health, and other \nsocial services. \n \n6.  Road Sector Development and Assistance in Afghanistan and Central Asia. The \nroad network in Afghanistan is in an extremely poor state following two decades of war and civil \nunrest.  Road  sector  institutions  are  weak  or  absent  and  lack  physical  and  administrative \nresources as well as institutional capacity. To address these shortcomings, a large TA8 was \napproved in May 2002 focusing on institutional development and capacity building and other \nimportant  activities.  In  addition,  a  loan  for  rehabilitation  of  critical  infrastructure  is  being \nprocessed for approval during 2003. ADB is also active in Central Asia, supporting subregional \ncooperation and removal of impediments to cross-border road transport through regional TA9 \nand/or financing of road rehabilitation projects in Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. \n \n7.  Institutional  Capacity  and  Constraints.    In  1970,  NWFP  established  a \nCommunications and Works Department (CWD) after the formation of the four provinces. CWD \nwas responsible for both roads and buildings, in particular the construction and maintenance of \nprovincial roads. In August 2001, several institutional changes took place in NWFP. The Frontier \nHighway Authority (FHA) was established as an autonomous body for construction, operation, \nrepair, and maintenance of the eight provincial highways (2,059 km) in NWFP and other roads \nspecially entrusted to it by the provincial government. In addition, the remaining functions of \nCWD  were  merged  with  two  other  departments,  Public  Health  Engineering  and  Physical \nPlanning and Housing, into a new department, called the Works and Services Department \n(W&S). As a consequence of the devolution process, which was formally initiated in August \n2001, further institutional measures have to be implemented over the medium term. These \nchanges include, inter alia, organizational changes at W&S, FHA, and the districts, and adoption \nof modern management systems and principles and of financial management and accounting \nsystems with appropriate audit systems, all of which are in support of good governance.  \n \n8.  Road Maintenance.  At the provincial government and FHA levels, there is increasing \nrecognition  that  additional  emphasis  and  spending  on  road  maintenance  is  necessary  to \npreserve the provincial road infrastructure asset base and prevent early deterioration of the \nprovincial  and  district  road  networks.  Key  road  maintenance  issues  in  NWFP  include  (i) \n                                                 \n7  The National Highway Authority is also constructing motorway no. 1 from Islamabad to Peshawar.  \n8  ADB. 2002.

Axle Load Control.  The control of axle loads has long been recognized as a serious \nproblem in reducing maintenance and rehabilitation expenditures. Vehicle overloading is a \nmajor issue impeding sustainable development of road sections in Pakistan, specifically in \nNWFP.  Surveys  conducted  by  road  agencies  indicate  that  trucks  and  tractor  trailers  are \ngenerally loaded beyond capacity, resulting in axle load 3-4 times the allowable single axle load \nof 12 tons. This causes roads to deteriorate rapidly, reducing their service life and significantly \nreducing  the  economic  benefits  that  should  have  been  realized  during  their  design  life. \nMoreover, the high recurrent costs of maintenance and the need for virtual reconstruction in \nmost  cases  erode  the  limited  development  resources  of  the  province.  NWFP  needs  to \naccelerate installation of weigh stations at strategic locations and introduce a fine collection \nsystem to address this escalating problem along with better enforcement of rules and regulation.  \n \n10.  Road Safety. A major issue in Pakistan is road safety as the fatality rate on the country's \nroad network remains among the highest in South Asia. The total fatalities to vehicle ratio in \nPakistan is about 10 times higher than that in developed countries. The causes are the higher \nmotor  vehicle  density,  higher  speeds,  lack  of  road  safety  measures, poor discipline and \nenforcement, and poor roadworthiness of vehicles. Road safety audits are not conducted \nroutinely for all new and improved roads. \n \n11.  Private Sector Participation.  While the opportunities for private sector participation in \nroad infrastructure projects are generally somewhat limited in NWFP due to the low traffic \nlevels, potential areas include contracting out of maintenance, toll operations for congested \nroads, and network management. \n \n12.  Lessons  Learned.  While  the  World  Bank  has  focused  mainly  on  and  provided \nassistance to the national road network administered by the National Highway Authority (NHA) \nat the federal level, ADB has targeted development of the provincial road networks.11 ADB has \napproved eight12 loans, totaling $897 million, for Pakistan\u2019s road sector, four of which have been \nfor umbrella projects that include components in each of the country\u2019s four provinces.13 That \narrangement has resulted in fragmentation of effort; coordination problems; and weakening of \nthe dialogue on critical policy issues such as road management and maintenance, institutional \nreform, procurement, and procedures at the provincial level. Moreover, the wide geographic \ndispersion of the projects and the large number of government agencies has limited the impact \non  the  individual  provinces,  and  project  implementation  has  suffered  from  delays  and \nimplementation problems. ADB\u2019s adopted provincial focus in the road sector in Pakistan draws \non these lessons.  \n \n                                                 \n10 The provincial revenue sources include annual motor vehicle taxes, tolls on provincial roads, ownership transfer \nfees, driver's license fees, and sugarcane cesses. \n11 The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has also provided assistance for development of provincial roads. \n12 Footnote 7.

Road Sector Development Strategy. While maintaining a continuing relationship with \nthe World Bank and the federal agencies for the national highway network, ADB is now focusing \non sustainable development of provincial road sector institutions and networks, allowing for \ngreater ownership, accountability, and development impact. Adopting a sectorwide approach \nthat sequences interventions in individual provinces over several years, the emphasis is on road \nsector policy reform at the provincial and district levels, support for capacity building, removal of \ncapacity bottlenecks, and physical rehabilitation of critical parts of the provincial road network, \nall having a positive impact on poverty reduction and pro-poor economic growth.14  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The objective of the TA is to assist the Government to prepare an integrated road \ndevelopment project, comprising a policy and investment program, for NWFP that will support \nsustainable pro-poor growth, reduce poverty, promote subregional cooperation, and be suitable \nfor external financing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will assist the provincial government of NWFP, W&S, and FHA to review existing \ninstitutional capacity and road sector policies and regulations, including impediments to cross-\nborder trade and traffic, and propose changes to address identified constraints for sustainable \ndevelopment of the road sector. Specifically, the TA will (i) identify prevailing policy constraints \nand institutional shortcomings in the road sector and recommend changes thereto; (ii) assess \nprospects and impediments for increased subregional trade and traffic, specifically cross-border \narrangements and major physical bottlenecks; (iii) identify, screen, and prioritize about 2,500 km \nof candidate roads based on the TA objective and on economic, social, and other criteria; (iv) \nupdate existing feasibility studies and prepare new ones, as appropriate, for the roads15 to be \nincluded in the proposed Project; (v) update and carry out, as appropriate, detailed design and \nengineering for the selected national and provincial highways and five core rural access roads; \n(vi) carry out social analysis, poverty impact, and environmental assessments for selected roads \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines; (vii) confirm the economic viability and poverty \nimpact of selected roads; (viii) propose suitable contract packaging; (ix) prepare complete civil \nworks bidding documents following ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on Procurement  and Sample Bidding \nDocuments for Civil Works; and (x) propose Project implementation arrangements and prepare \nschedules for project completion. There are no major risks associated with the TA, and the \nprovincial government of NWFP has expressed its strong support for it. \n \n                                                 \n14 The first provincial road sector intervention that adopted the new sectorwide approach was ADB. 2001. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Pakistan for the Road Sector \nDevelopment Program, the investment loan component of $150 million of which covers the province of Sindh, and \nwhich was approved on 21 December 2001. The second provincial road sector intervention was ADB. 2002. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Pakistan for the Punjab \nRoad Development Sector Project, which was approved on 31 October 2002. \n15 Following identification, screening, and prioritization of candidate roads, those to be included in the Project, among \n2,500 km of screened national and provincial highways and rural access roads, will be jointly selected by the \nprovincial  government  of  NWFP,  the  Federal  Government,  NHA,  and  ADB  during  the  early  stage  of  TA \nimplementation. ", "    5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $620,000  equivalent  including  a  foreign \nexchange cost of $202,000 and a local currency cost of $418,000 equivalent. The detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. ADB will finance $490,000 equivalent, including the entire foreign \nexchange cost and local currency costs of $288,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Government will finance the remaining local \ncurrency costs of $130,000 equivalent. The Government has been advised that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  W&S will be the Executing Agency. An experienced project director placed under the \nSecretary  of  W&S  has  already  been  appointed  and  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nmanagement and administration of the TA. W&S will be responsible for providing office and \nsupport  facilities,  counterpart  staff,  documentation,  and  other  required  services.  NHA  will \nappoint a project coordinator at the national level who will be responsible for all communications \nand  coordination  with  the  TA  consultants.  To  provide  overall  guidance  during  TA \nimplementation, a steering committee16 will be established by NWFP. \n \n18.  The TA will require 43 person-months of consulting services, comprising 8 person-\nmonths of international consultants and 35 person-months of domestic consultants, to carry out \nthe activities as defined in the outline terms of reference (Appendix 3). A team of consultants, \nfrom an international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants, will be engaged \nusing ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection procedures and according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of \ndomestic consultants.17 The international consultants will have expertise in (i) transport policy \nand  economics,  and  (ii)  social  and  poverty  analysis  including  resettlement  planning.  The \ndomestic consultants will have expertise in (i) transport economics, (ii) highway and bridge \ndesign including structural engineering, (iii) geotechnical analysis and materials engineering, (iv) \ntraffic  engineering,  (v)  surveying,  (vi)  procurement  and  contract  management,  (vii) \nenvironmental analysis, (viii) social and poverty analysis, and (ix) resettlement planning. \n \n19.  The TA consultants are expected to be fielded in August 2003 and to be finished in \nDecember  2003;  the  consulting  services  will  be  carried  out  over  5  months.  During  TA \nimplementation, workshops and tripartite meetings involving the provincial government, NHA, \nADB, the consultants, and other stakeholders will be held in NWFP, as needed. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $490,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the North-West Frontier Road Development Sector \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n16 The steering committee will comprise representatives from NWFP and NHA.

Objective \n \n1.  The objective of the technical assistance (TA) is to assist the Government, the Works \nand Services Department (W&S), and the Frontier Highway Authority (FHA) to prepare an \nintegrated roads development project, comprising a policy and investment program, for North-\nWest Frontier Province (NWFP) that will support sustainable pro-poor growth, reduce poverty, \npromote subregional cooperation, and be suitable for external financing.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n2.  Policy Program. The consultants will review existing institutional arrangements at W&S \nand FHA and assess road sector policies and regulation, including impediments to cross-border \ntrade  and  traffic,  and  propose  changes  necessary  to  address  identified  constraints  for \nsustainable development of the road sector in NWFP over the medium term. Priority areas for \ndetailed  assessment  and  review  include  (i)  policies,  regulations,  and  administrative \narrangements  for  international  road  traffic  including  cross-border  arrangements;  (ii)  the \ninstitutional setup and capacity at W&S, FHA, and the district level; (iii) capacity building and \ntraining needs at W&S, FHA, and the districts; (iv) maintenance organization and mechanisms \nfor secure and stable funding for road maintenance including establishment of a road fund; (v) \ngovernance,  specifically  financial  management  and  accounting  systems,  including  audit \nfunctions;  (vi)  private  sector  involvement  in  operations,  maintenance,  and  civil  works \nconstruction; (vii) road safety; (viii) axle load control; and (ix) the use of modern planning and \nasset management systems and tools, such as the Highway Design and Maintenance Model, \nVersion 4 (HDM-4), road asset management, project management, and other similar systems. \n \n3.  Investment Program. The consultants will do the following: \n \n(i)  Identify, screen, and prioritize about 2,500 kilometers (km) of candidate roads \namong national and provincial highways and rural access roads based on the TA \nobjective and on economic, social, and other criteria. The consultants will, in \nclose coordination and cooperation with the provincial and district authorities, \nadopting  a  participatory  approach,  consult  with  all  relevant  stakeholders, \nespecially the poor people; and conduct public meetings and dialogues with the \ncommunities in the project areas to obtain feedback on the proposed candidate \nroads, and on the social and environmental mitigation measures envisaged. The \nresults of the consultation and the dialogue with the communities and other \nstakeholders will be incorporated in the analysis and taken into account in the \nselection of roads.  \n \n(ii)  Update existing feasibility studies,18 and prepare new ones, as appropriate, for \nthe selected roads among national and provincial highways and five core rural \naccess roads,19 to be included in the project following approval by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  the  Government  of  NWFP,  and  the  Federal \nGovernment.  \n \n                                                 \n18 Feasibility refers to complete appraisal of all technical; economic; financial; social including resettlement, gender, \nand poverty; and environment aspects and other related issues of the candidate roads in accordance with all \nrelevant Asian Development Bank guidelines and best international practices.  \n19 The feasibility and detailed engineering studies for the five core rural access roads will serve as the standard for \nsimilar work to be carried out for selected rural access roads during project implementation.

Specifically, the consultants will do the following: \n \n(a)  Carry out an economic evaluation (20-year benefit stream period) of the \nalternative improvement options for each road section and project road by \ncalculating the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) based on benefits \nand  costs,  including  those  for  civil  works,  rights-of-way,  detailed \nengineering, and construction supervision. The choice between mutually \nexclusive improvement options will be based on the net present worth \nmethod at a discount rate of 12%.  \n(b)  Identify the beneficiaries of the proposed road improvements; classify \nthem according to income class; assess the poverty reduction aspects of \nthe road improvements, and how many poor people would be affected in \nrelation  to  the  total  population  in  the  project  influence  areas  during \nconstruction  and  during  the  benefit  stream  period;  and  estimate  the \nimpact of the road improvements, if any, on employment of women. \nPrepare  a  distribution  analysis  of  quantified  economic  benefits  and \nestimation of poverty impact ratios for selected roads in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Analysis in the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. \n(c)  Undertake sensitivity tests for individual key parameters and assumptions \nand recommended improvements underlying the estimated benefits and \ncosts by appropriately varying benefits, project costs, maintenance levels, \nincluding lower than expected levels of maintenance delivery and higher \nmaintenance demand due to higher axle-loads (and their implications for \nroughness  in  the  with-  and  the  without-  Project  situations  related  to \nEIRR), and the implementation period. Calculate switching values as \nappropriate. \n(d)  Carry out quantitative risk analysis of the Project and its components in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Handbook for Integrating Risk Analysis in the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. \n(v)  Update and carry out, as appropriate, detailed design and engineering for about \n400 km of the selected national and provincial highways and five core rural \naccess roads including the following: \n \n(a)  Update  or  carry  out,  as  appropriate,  topographic  surveys  to  reflect \npresent conditions.

The traffic surveys will include nonmotorized vehicles of all types. \nAnalyze the new traffic and axle load data for confirming or amending the \ntraffic forecasts and axle load projections.  \n \n(c)  Review the suitability of the proposed alignments, sections, and road \nintersections,  taking  into  account  safety  considerations. In particular, \ndevelop appropriate means of minimizing conflicts between fast-moving \nmotorized traffic and slow-moving motorized and nonmotorized traffic.  \n \n(d)  Review the drainage and hydrological designs proposed for the selected \nroads and prepare, as required, new designs that will provide appropriate \ndrainage, vehicle standing, bus loading, pedestrian refuge, traffic control, \nand other facilities as may be required.  \n \n(e)  Make  an  inventory  and  update  the  condition  of  all  bridge/culvert \nstructures.  Review the appropriateness of the original structural designs \nincluding  rehabilitation  options  based  on  the  current  conditions  and \nprepare new designs where required for the selected roads. In particular, \nassess,  through  nondestructive  methods,  whether  bridges  that  were \noriginally to have been rehabilitated have since deteriorated to such an \nextent that replacement is now more appropriate.  \n \n(f)  Review and, if required, carry out hydrological design in accordance with \nthe  prevailing  site  conditions.    This  will  include  evaluation  of  stream \nregimes and local floods, and assessment of the protection and training \nworks and of drainage structures provided in the original design.  \n \n(g)  Based  on  a  testing  program  that  includes  field/laboratory  testing, \ndeflection testing of pavements, and required condition surveys, evaluate \nthe appropriateness of the original pavement design for the prevailing \nconditions  and  updated  axle  loads.    Also,  identify  areas  affected  by \nsalinity and waterlogging and their effects on embankment design. \n \n(vi)  Carry out social analysis including assessment of gender and indigenous people \nincluding a detailed study of tribal people, and prepare appropriate action plans, \nas required, in accordance with ADB's Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis, \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People, and other relevant ADB requirements and \npolicies.  \n \n(vii)  Carry  out  resettlement  planning  and  prepare  a  rehabilitation  action  plan  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  Handbook  on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, and other requirements.   \n \n(viii)  Carry out poverty impact assessments for selected roads in accordance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines and procedural requirements.  \n \n(ix)  To address environmental issues, ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n \n(a)  Evaluate  the  capacity  of  the  Executing  Agency  in  conducting  the \nenvironmental assessment of the Project and subprojects in accordance \nwith the environmental requirements of the Government and ADB, and \nrecommend institutional strengthening measures, if necessary. \n \n(b)  Examine policy and institutional changes proposed under the Project to \ndetermine their environmental implications, and consider the introduction \nof appropriate environmental interventions. \n \n(c)  Carry  out  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and/or  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) and prepare summary EIA and/or IEE \nreports  and  summary  EIA  and/or  IEE  reports  for  selected  roads  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Environment  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines, and other requirements of ADB and the Government.  \n \n(d)  Recommend environmental criteria for selection of subprojects. \n \n(e)  Develop an environmental assessment and review procedure (including \nconsultation  and  disclosure,  as  needed)  for  follow-on  subprojects  to \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Environment Safeguard Policy. \n \n(x)  Propose suitable contract packaging for selected roads and identify the need for \nadvance action.  \n \n(xi)  Prepare complete civil works prequalification (including evaluation guidelines) \nand  bidding  documents  for  selected  roads  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nProcurement and Sample Bidding Documents for Civil Works. \n \n(xii)  Prepare terms  of  reference  for  construction  supervision  including  inputs  for \ndesign  review  and  additional  design  work  during  construction,  resettlement, \nsocial impact monitoring, etc. \n \n(xiii)  Review  project  implementation  arrangements  and  recommend  measures  for \nstrengthening of project management at W&S, FHA, and the district level. \n \n(xiv)  Prepare  schedules  for  all  components  of  the  Project  and  a  corresponding \ndisbursement schedule.  \n \n(xv)  Identify the need for capacity building and training of staff at W&S, FHA, and the \ndistrict level, and prepare a comprehensive training component and package for \ninclusion in the Project. \n \n(xvi)  Specify how the use of HDM-4 can be institutionalized at W&S and FHA over the \nmedium term. \n \n(xvii)  Prepare a project performance monitoring and evaluation program including, but \nnot limited to, appropriate monitoring indicators and baseline data. \n ", " 12 Appendix 3 \n \nC.
