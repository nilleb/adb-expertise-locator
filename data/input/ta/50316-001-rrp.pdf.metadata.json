THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the National Disaster Risk Management Fund (project). \nThe report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nGovernment of Australia for the National Disaster Risk Management Fund project, and (ii) the \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  of  Disaster  Risk  Management \nInstitutions,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant and the TA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will provide financial, technical, and capacity development support \nto the National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF), a not-for-profit association to be \nincorporated  under  section  42  of  the  Companies  Ordinance,  1984.  The  NDRMF  will  be \ngovernment-owned and will aim to reduce Pakistan\u2019s socioeconomic and fiscal vulnerability to \nnatural hazards and climate variability and change.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  High  incidence  and  cost  of  disasters.  Pakistan  requires  substantial  financing  to \nmitigate its significant disaster risk. The country, its population, and assets are increasingly \nexposed and vulnerable to various natural hazards. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, \nit was one of the 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events during 1995\u20132014.2 \nSince  2000,  increasing  natural  hazards  have  resulted  in  significant  loss  of  life,  economic \ndamage, and the reversal of development gains. Frequent floods have caused the greatest \nphysical damage. Three major floods in 2010, 2011, and 2014 affected more than 30 million \npeople, resulting in more than $14 billion in damage and losses. In 2005, a major earthquake \ncaused more than 73,000 deaths and $5 billion in losses. The country also experiences tropical \ncyclones and droughts; a drought in 2014\u20132015 affected over 3 million people. These events \nseverely  impact  the  livelihoods  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  resulting  in  mass  migration, \ndisrupting trade and commerce, and destabilizing the market. Such events negatively impact \ngovernment  budgets,  periodically  placing  significant  additional  demands  on  limited  public \nresources for humanitarian relief, early recovery, and reconstruction. \n \n4.  High  vulnerability  to  climate  change.  Climate  change  is  expected  to  result  in \nincreased temperatures, glacial melt, rising sea levels in coastal areas, and changes in the \nfrequency and intensity of precipitation. Extreme weather events such as floods and droughts \nare likely to become more frequent in Pakistan in the future, potentially increasing disaster \nlosses if appropriate action is not taken. Rapid unplanned urbanization intensifies the exposure \nand vulnerabilities of the population, especially the poor, increasing disaster risks. \n \n5.  Significant  fiscal  impact  of  disasters.  Frequent  disasters  in  Pakistan  pose  a \nsignificant risk to the fiscal stability of the federal and provincial governments. The annual \neconomic impact of flooding alone is estimated at $1.2 billion\u2013$1.8 billion, equivalent to 0.5%\u2013\n0.8% of gross domestic product.3 The toll has been high, totaling $25.5 billion since 2005. A \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Germanwatch e.V. 2015.

Berlin. \n3  World Bank Group, Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. 2015. Fiscal Disaster Risk Assessment \nOptions for Consideration: Pakistan. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \nsignificant portion of relief, early recovery, and reconstruction costs is taken from scarce federal \nand  provincial  government  resources.  Each  year,  the  federal  government  budgets  limited \nresources for post-disaster response, but it often requires significant additional resources to \nsupport affected communities and rebuild the country\u2019s social and economic infrastructure after \ndisasters. This response puts considerable pressure on public finances, with increases in fiscal \ndeficits and public debt, and diverts scarce funds away from development operations. \n \n6.  Evolving  disaster  risk  governance  and  resource  constraints.  Since  a  massive \nearthquake struck Pakistan in 2005, the government\u2019s disaster risk management (DRM) policy \nand strategy have moved from being largely response-oriented to having a broader approach \nstressing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and preparedness. Constitutional changes introduced in \n2013  have  also  transferred  many  responsibilities  from  the  federal  to  the  provincial  level. \nHowever, progress is limited by financing and capacity constraints. The government has worked \nextensively,  with  support  from  multiple  development  partners,  to  promulgate  the  National \nDisaster Management Act, 2010 and to establish the National Disaster Management Authority \nand provincial and district disaster management authorities. The National Disaster Management \nAct also provides the legal framework for establishing dedicated funds for DRM at the provincial \nand federal levels. DRM-related planning has become the responsibility of the national and \nprovincial planning ministries and the federal Ministry of Climate Change. Despite this progress, \nnational, provincial, and district disaster management authorities have limited technical capacity. \nThe mainstreaming of DRM in planning and operations is still in its initial stages in all key \nfederal and provincial ministries, departments, and agencies. The project will help accelerate \nthe mainstreaming efforts of entities responsible for DRM by providing dedicated DRR and \ncapacity development resources, and supporting systematic disaster risk assessments and \nDRM  coordination  mechanisms  at  multiple  levels.  This  will  facilitate  a  coherent  and \ninstitutionalized  DRM  approach  across  sectors  and  among  federal,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernments. \n \n7.  Disaster  risk  management  policy  and  strategic  environment. The government\u2019s \nstrategy is to make a long-term commitment to DRM by putting in place policies and plans to \naddress structural and nonstructural aspects of DRM comprehensively and systematically. The \nnational DRR and climate change policies were approved in 2013, while the National Disaster \nManagement  Plan  (NDMP),  which  includes  an  investment  program  for  2012\u20132022,  was \napproved in 2012. The NDMP contains 10 core intervention areas and 118 proposed priority \nactions and programs focused on reducing disaster risk and enhancing the country\u2019s ability to \nmanage disasters.4 The priority actions cover all stages of the pre- and post-disaster cycle. The \ndraft National Flood Protection Plan IV (NFPP-IV) for 2016\u20132026 complements the NDMP and \nfocuses on integrated flood risk management.5 The two plans have a combined cost of about $3 \nbillion. The NDRMF will finance eligible subprojects from the two plans, based on detailed \nvulnerability and risk assessments as well as specific criteria, including adequate economic \nreturns, safeguards, and sustainability (para. 20). \n \n8.  ADB assistance and country partnership strategy. The proposed project is in line \nwith the country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan6 and the Operational Plan for \n                                                \n4  The cost of implementing the NDMP was estimated at nearly $1.1 billion when the NDMP was formulated in 2012. \nSince then it has been recognized that the NDMP\u2019s investment requirements are significantly underestimated. \nGovernment of Pakistan, Ministry of Climate Change, National Disaster Management Authority. 2012.

ADB support has focused mainly on reconstruction, \nand it has issued nearly $2 billion in loans and grants during 2005\u20132015 for the reconstruction \nof  transport,  irrigation  and  flood  protection,  housing,  education,  health,  and  livelihood \ninfrastructure that is resistant to multiple hazards, together with DRM capacity building. The \nFlood Emergency Reconstruction and Resilience Project approved in 2015 and the proposed \nproject  mark  a  shift  in  ADB\u2019s  focus  toward  a  greater  emphasis  on  DRR  and  DRF,  while \ncontinuing to support reconstruction and rehabilitation.8 The government has asked ADB to be \nthe lead development partner in this critical area, with the proposed project a key element of \nADB\u2019s support for DRR and DRF. \n \n9.  Lessons. The country assistance program evaluation of ADB programs in Pakistan \nduring  2002\u20132012  emphasizes  that  ADB  must  improve  its  support  for  integrated  disaster \nprevention and long-term preparedness.9 It recommends that ADB further mainstream DRR \nmeasures in its infrastructure projects, and work closely with ministries and agencies to improve \nthe disaster resilience of infrastructure and community preparedness. Lessons also indicate that \nlimited government technical and financial capacity and high levels of disaster risk warrant \ncomprehensive and sustained ADB support for all aspects of DRM, in close coordination and \npartnership with specialized local and international agencies. Experience from ADB programs \nhighlights the need to include well-targeted support for the vulnerable, community involvement \nin DRM, strong linkages with existing development programs, support for technical innovations \nfor  investment  sustainability  and  multi-hazard  resilience,  and  effective  coordination  and \nmonitoring of future DRM interventions. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be a more disaster-resilient Pakistan with reduced socioeconomic and \nfiscal vulnerability to natural hazards and climate variability and change. The outcome will be \nincreased and sustainable institutional and physical capacity to reduce the socioeconomic and \nfiscal impacts of natural hazards and climate change. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The  project  outputs  are  (i)  the  NDRMF  established  and  made  operational,  (ii) \ninvestments to reduce vulnerabilities to natural hazards increased, and (iii) analytical work and \nproducts to improve the fiscal management of disaster risk completed. \n \n12.  Output 1: The National Disaster Risk Management Fund established and made \noperational. Key activities under this output include (i) the full operationalization of the NDRMF, \nincluding recruitment of its management team and technical staff; (ii) the establishment of the \nrequired governance, due diligence, quality control, and fiduciary arrangements for the NDRMF \nto function effectively and efficiently; (iii) the provision of capacity building support to assist \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

The NDRMF will establish, \noperate,  and  maintain  the  endowment  fund  following  rules,  regulations,  and  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. The legal framework for the endowment is provided in the National Disaster \nManagement Act (para 6). The initial contribution from ADB and the government would be \ninvested in low-risk, relatively safe government securities and instruments. Income earned from \nthe endowment fund will be used to cover the NDRMF\u2019s full operating costs from the fourth year \nof its operations. Financial projections indicate that the endowment fund\u2019s annual income will \nsignificantly  exceed  planned  expenditures.  The  NDRMF  may  use  the  excess  income  for \nadditional  investments  in  interest-  and/or  profit-bearing  securities  and  for  financing  DRR \nactivities, as approved by its board of directors.10 Under this output, a comprehensive effort \nstrategically directed at resource mobilization would be undertaken to diversity the NDRMF\u2019s \nfunding base. This effort would be aimed at multilateral and bilateral organizations, the United \nNations system, international and national philanthropic organizations, and the private sector. \nThe NDRMF will also explore opportunities to access global climate financing sources. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Investments  to  reduce  vulnerabilities  to  natural  hazards  increased. \nUnder this  output, the NDRMF  will  ongrant funds  on  a  cost-sharing basis to  eligible fund \nimplementation partners (FIPs) that meet the accreditation criteria11 for eligible subprojects.12 \nThe  FIPs  will  include  federal,  provincial,  and  district  government  entities;  autonomous \norganizations; civil society; and academia. The NDRMF will provide funding through matching \ngrants of up to 70% for a range of structural and nonstructural interventions. Key activities \ninclude (i) retrofitting or building about 300 kilometers of flood protection infrastructure; (ii) \nretrofitting about 500 public buildings, including schools and health facilities, against multiple \nhazards;  (iii)  delivering  nonstructural  preventive  measures,  including  preparing  and \nimplementing  national  and  subnational  emergency  response  plans;  (iv)  establishing  early \nwarning systems, including procuring and installing radars and river, rain, and stream gauges; \n(v) designing and implementing community-based DRM activities; (vi) conducting analytical \nwork, such as multi-hazard vulnerability risk assessments for vulnerable districts and urban \ncenters covering gender-related vulnerabilities and climate change research and studies; (vii) \nmainstreaming  and  monitoring  DRR,  including  developing  procedures  for  analysis  and \nintegrating disaster risk during project preparation, and tracking DRR and disaster response \nexpenditure; and (viii) building capacity to strengthen national and local DRM organizations. The \nNDRMF will assess, prioritize, sequence, and monitor the interventions. \n \n14.  Output 3:  Analytical work and products to improve the fiscal management of \ndisaster risk completed. The NDRMF will carry out quantitative risk modeling analysis for the \nprimary natural hazards faced by Pakistan and develop a comprehensive national DRF strategy \nbased on the analysis results. The risk modeling work will be used to derive disaster risk maps \nand quantitative national and subnational information on the expected levels of loss for hazard \nevents  of  varying  types,  intensities,  and  return  periods.  The  NDRMF  will  then  identify \n                                                \n10 The endowment fund is projected to generate income of $9.17 million in 2017, $9.76 million in 2018, $10.38 million \nin 2019, $10.88 million in 2020, and $11.44 million in 2021. Annual average operating expenses for the NDRMF \nare projected at $2.5 million. \n11 The NDRMF will prepare the accreditation criteria following the requirements set out in the project administration \nmanual (PAM), which will be approved by the NDRMF\u2019s board of directors and ADB. \n12 The subproject selection criteria are provided in the PAM, which will be further refined and approved by the \nNDRMF\u2019s board of directors. Subproject selection criteria include (i) the inclusion of the subprojects in the NDMP \nor NFFP-IV, (ii) an economic internal rate of return of at least 12% for works and equipment subprojects, (iii) \nfinancial sustainability of the subprojects in the form of assured provision of operation and maintenance funds, and \n(iv) compliance with ADB safeguard requirements. \n ", "5 \nappropriate DRF tools, including insurance mechanisms, for each layer of loss based on the \ncombined multi-hazard loss curves to strengthen the country\u2019s DRM capability. The tools will \nalso take into account (i) the scale of funding required for each layer of loss; (ii) the speed with \nwhich post-disaster funding is required for relief, early recovery, and reconstruction purposes; \n(iii) the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative instruments for specific layers of loss; (iv) the \nparticular disaster-related needs of vulnerable groups; and (v) the contribution to long-term \ndisaster resilience. This output will support the development of two priority financing instruments \nidentified in the national DRF strategy and initiate the pilot testing of one of them.13 \n \nD.

Based on the \nimplementation  progress  and  future  satisfactory  appraisals,  and  subject  to  further  Board \napproval, ADB will consider further financing requests from the government to provide up to \n$1 billion  through  additional  financing  during  2018\u20132023,  to  contribute  to  the  $3  billion \nrequirement to finance the implementation of the future NDMP and NFPP-IV. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  Executing and implementing agencies. The Economic Affairs Division (EAD) of the \nMinistry of Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Privatization will be the executing \nagency and the NDRMF will be the implementing agency for the project. The NDRMF is in the \nprocess of being incorporated as a not-for-profit association under section 42 of the Companies \nOrdinance, 1984 (governance arrangements are in para. 26).16 The EAD will ensure that (i) the \nNDRMF performs in line with its mandate; (ii) the transfer of contributions from contributors and \ngovernment  counterpart  funding  to  NDRMF  accounts  is  done  in  a  timely  manner;  (iii)  all \ncontribution agreements signed between the executing agency and the contributors for NDRMF \noperations are implemented; and (iv) a review of the NDRMF\u2019s performance is done regularly \nand reported to ADB. \n \n20.  Role of the National Disaster Risk Management Fund. The NDRMF will provide \nfinancial and technical support to government and nongovernment partners to implement the \nNDMP and NFFP-IV. It will assess and prioritize subprojects for which ongranting is requested. \nThe NDRMF will (i) adopt acceptable corporate and financial governance and management \npractices (e.g., the Code of Corporate Governance, 2012); (ii) have its accounts and financial \nstatements audited annually by independent auditors in a manner acceptable to ADB; (iii) have \nadequate policies, systems, and procedures to assess and monitor subprojects\u2019 economic, \nsocial,  and  environmental  impacts  (e.g.,  adopt  an  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem [ESMS],  and  prepare  necessary  safeguard  documents,  where  applicable);  and (iv) \nensure that an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of at least 12% for works and equipment \nsubprojects is achieved. The NDRMF  will also monitor the implementation performance of \napproved subprojects. \n \n21.  Procurement.  The  NDRMF  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time) in all institutional procurement, and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) in engaging the consulting services of firms \nand individuals. ADB procurement guidelines applicable to financial intermediaries will apply to \nthe funds ongranted to FIPs (para. 17). ADB will engage a TA-financed consultant to provide \ninstitutional procurement support to the NDRMF during the start-up phase of its operations. The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).17 \n   \n                                                \n16 A company incorporated as a government-owned, not-for-profit association under section 42 of the government\u2019s \nCompanies  Ordinance,  1984  enjoys  all  privileges  and  is  subject  to  all  obligations  of  a  limited  company. \nGovernment-owned section 42 companies have to comply with the Code of Corporate Governance, 2012, which is \na robust governance framework. \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  24 November 2016\u201317 November 2019 \nEstimated completion date  17 November 2019 (loan closing date is 17 May 2020) \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Economic Affairs Division of the Ministry of Finance, Revenue, \nEconomic Affairs, Statistics and Privatization \n(ii)  Implementing agency  National Disaster Risk Management Fund \nProcurement  Shopping  10 contracts  $0.7 million \nConsulting services  QCBS: 4 contracts  636 person-months  $10.8 million \nLCS: 2 contracts \nIndividual  352 person-months  $2.3 million \nconsultants \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and \nADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, LCS = least-cost selection, QCBS = quality and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n22.  A  capacity  development  TA  will  be  associated  with  the  project  to  fast-track \nimplementation. The TA will support the establishment of the NDRMF\u2019s core functions, including \nthe  development  of  (i)  quality  control  and  subproject  review  parameters;  and  (ii)  NDRMF \npolicies, bylaws, and systems for auditing, financial management and control, procurement, \nsafeguards,  and  gender  considerations  to  speed  up  the  start-up  process.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 36 months from 10 December 2016. The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, \nof which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-V). The EAD will be the executing agency of the TA. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The TA \nwill finance 4 person-months of individual international consultants and 136 person-months of \nindividual national consultants. ADB will engage the consultants following its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).18 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The  NDRMF\u2019s  management  team  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  technical  due \ndiligence of subprojects to be considered for NDRMF financing. They will conduct technical \ncapacity  reviews  of  potential  FIPs  for  accreditation  and  undertake  technical  reviews  of  all \nsubproject proposals received from FIPs based on subproject selection and prioritization criteria \nprovided in the PAM (footnote 17). The NDRMF technical staff will leverage the capacity and \ninstitutional knowledge developed in Pakistan during the implementation of the large portfolio of \nDRM projects by ADB and other development partners, some of which are ongoing, through the \nNDRMF\u2019s roster of experts. To fast-track implementation and reduce up-front risks, the first \ngroup of subprojects will be undertaken with entities that have ongoing or completed DRM \nprojects financed by ADB and key multilateral development partners. The experts hired through \n                                                \n18 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nthe associated TA will conduct a third level of due diligence to provide an independent review of \nthe quality and quantity of work completed by the FIPs. They will report directly to ADB. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  A comprehensive economic analysis was conducted to estimate the net present value \nand EIRR of the $257 million investment. The project team evaluated the benefits of a sample of \nsubprojects  proposed  in  the  NDMP  by  considering  the  losses  averted  because  of  the \nimplementation of flood protection works, early warning systems, and community-based DRM \nactivities. The EIRR estimated for the project is at least 16.83% and NPV is positive. The EIRR \nof the project exceeds the ADB benchmark of 12.00%. For the purpose of the analysis, the \nopportunity cost of the endowment investment is included as a project cost. The NDRMF should \nassess individual DRR subprojects and target investments with high EIRRs of at least 12% to \nbe eligible for financing. \n \n25.  To ensure its financial sustainability, the NDRMF will establish an endowment fund with \nan initial capitalization of $123.3 million in its first year. By 2021, the endowment fund is \nprojected to generate $51.6 million in income from short- and long-term investments to cover \noperational expenses as well as reserve buildup.19 The sensitivity analysis shows that the \nNDRMF\u2019s projected cash flows are well insulated against adverse systemic developments, such \nas the return on investment declining or operating expenses increasing due to inflationary \nand/or cost pressures. Even in the significantly restrictive and unlikely scenario of both negative \ndevelopments taking place simultaneously, the NDRMF\u2019s sustainability remains protected. The \nNDRMF\u2019s endowed capital allocation ensures stable and sustained operations and a buildup of \nreserves to maintain nonstructural DRM activities even if fund inflows dry out. The NDRMF will \nalso prepare a resource mobilization strategy to solicit private funding actively from domestic \nand international sources to leverage the financing provided by ADB and the government. This \neffort  will  target  corporations,  multinationals,  global  climate  funds,  and  high  net  worth \nindividuals. The NDRMF may charge a management fee to defray incremental administrative \ncosts  so  that  partnerships  do  not  increase  existing  operating  expenses  and  prevent \nintermediation costs of core operations from increasing. An investment management policy will \nbe prepared to guide the NDRMF\u2019s investment activities. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  The NDRMF will be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan \nand will be subject to extensive statutory governance and reporting requirements under the \nCompanies Ordinance, 1984 and relevant rules. The NDRMF will have a robust governance \nand management structure comprising a general body of 40 members, a board of directors with \n12\u201315 members, and a management team headed by a chief executive officer.20 To ensure the \nsuccess of the new entity, ADB will provide TA support (para. 22). \n \n27.  The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  confirmed  that  the  government\u2019s \nbudgetary,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting  and  auditing  systems  and  procedures  are \nfunctioning effectively. The FMA noted that an internal audit function will have to be established \nat the NDRMF, which also needs to prioritize hiring and putting in place adequate accounting \nand finance staff. Various risks and mitigation measures are included in the FMA, while key \nrisks  are  set  out  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.21 Overall,  the  FMA \n                                                \n19 The NDRMF\u2019s estimated annual operating expenses average $2.5 million for 2017\u20132021. \n20 A detailed description of the NDRMF\u2019s governance structure is in the PAM. \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nassessed the pre-mitigation financial management risk as substantial. The FMA highlighted key \nissues such as the need for adequate staffing of the NDRMF, capacity building of NDRMF staff, \nand operationalization of the internal audit function.  During the first 6 months, the associated \nTA  will  help  the  NDRMF  set  up,  strengthen,  and  fully  operationalize  the  NDRMF\u2019s  core \nfunctions, including financial management. \n \n28.  Other than institutional procurement by the NDRMF, all procurement will be done by the \nFIPs, which will be required to follow procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. During the \nfirst 6 months of its operations, the NDRMF will prepare a procurement procedural manual and \nalso  put  in  place  a  procurement  framework  describing  (i)  functional  responsibilities  and \naccountabilities for procurement activities; (ii) procurement systems and processes, including \nguidance on anticorruption policies and conflicts of interest; (iii) procurement skills; and (iv) a \ncapacity  review  process.  These  processes  and  systems  are  subject  to  ADB  review  and \napproval. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  EAD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Although the project is classified general intervention, it will directly benefit poor and \nvulnerable people living in high-risk areas. The NDRMF will finance (i) the carrying out of \nnational and subnational multi-hazard vulnerability risk assessments in 20 vulnerable districts \nand  urban  centers,  which  will  help  develop  informed  DRM  plans  targeting  vulnerable \npopulations; (ii) the retrofitting of social infrastructure (e.g., public schools and health facilities) \nthat predominantly serve low-income groups; and (iii) the development of emergency response \nplans and early warning systems in highly vulnerable districts of the country. \n \n31.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, with key measures indicated in \nthe gender action plan.22 The NDRMF will establish appropriate procedures,23 policies, and \nsystems;  and  build  institutional  capacity  in  gender-responsive  DRR  and  disaster  response \nsystems.24 NDRMF\u2019s core staff will comprise at least 20% women and will include a social and \ngender officer responsible for implementing and monitoring the project\u2019s social, poverty, and \ngender dimensions. The NDRMF will recruit a short-term expert to guide, review, and support \ngender activities and plans. TA-financed gender experts will (i) develop the monitoring systems, \npolicies, and guidelines for social and gender-related plans; (ii) develop NDRMF staff capacity; \nand (iii) independently assess the gender impacts. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  The  project  is  classified  financial  intermediary  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. The project will not finance any category A subprojects. \nNo significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated, as most civil works will involve \nretrofitting or rehabilitating existing facilities. Negative impacts during construction will likely be \nshort  term,  site-specific,  and  mitigable.  Proposals  that  involve  no  or  limited  involuntary \n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Procedures that outline the gender-based review process of subprojects. \n24 Gender policy, including key instruments for DRM operations, includes gender mainstreaming criteria for the \nscreening and approval of proposals. The criteria are aligned with the following: Government of Pakistan, National \nDisaster Management Authority. 2014. National Policy Guidelines on Vulnerable Groups in Disasters. Islamabad. \n ", "11 \nresettlement impacts will be prioritized. No impacts on indigenous peoples are anticipated. An \nESMS document has been prepared. The project may finance subprojects classified category B \nfor  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  in  line  with  the \nrequirements set out in the ESMS document. The TA consultants will provide initial support to \nimplement the measures outlined in the ESMS. ADB may tap a pool of NDRMF safeguard \nexperts to help conduct safeguard reviews of proposals and implement safeguard plans in \nsubprojects. The NDRMF will adopt an ESMS satisfactory to ADB before the first disbursement \nfor the financing of subprojects. ADB will audit the ESMS annually and review it semiannually. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 21). The integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the cost of the risk mitigating measures. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe NDRMF lacks  The NDRMF will establish an independent internal audit function.
