INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will develop innovative technology \nfor flash flood early warning systems and promote a community-based approach in flood risk \nmanagement in selected river basins within the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The TA will assist the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) in \nimproving the coverage and the accuracy of flash flood early warning systems, as well as their \napplications, in urban and rural settings in the Yangtze River Basin and beyond.1 \n \n2.  The MWR implemented the National Flash Flood Disaster Prevention Plan during 2010\u2013\n2016 and is currently planning nationwide implementation of the activities related to the second \nphase while addressing the emerging challenges in flash flood risk mitigation.2 The Government \nof the PRC requested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to improve the application, \ncoverage, and accuracy of flash flood early warning systems in the YREB. The TA is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for the PRC.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The government has identified the YREB as one of the three key growth engines of the \nPRC\u2019s future economic development. The YREB comprises nine provinces (Anhui, Guizhou, \nHubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang) and two centrally administered \nmunicipalities (Chongqing and Shanghai). It covers more than 2 million square kilometers along \nthe Yangtze River\u2014one-fifth of the country\u2019s total area. The YREB is the country\u2019s economic \nbackbone, accounts for more than 40% of the PRC\u2019s total population, and contributes about \n45% to the gross domestic product. The Yangtze River Basin has high biodiversity and provides \n40% of the PRC\u2019s freshwater resources, serves as the source of drinking water for more than \n400 million people, accounts for 20% of the total wetland areas in the PRC, and nurtures 60% of \nthe total fishery resources across the country. \n \n4.  Since 1980, the YREB has suffered more than $0.3 trillion in direct economic damage \nfrom recurring floods, accounting for 75% of total flood damage in the PRC. An important lesson \nlearned from recent floods in the YREB is that the majority of flood damage does not come from \nthe  main  stem  river  but  from  small-  to  moderate-sized  river  basins.  In  2016,  the  YREB \nexperienced fatal floods that led to $28 billion in economic damage and emergency declarations \nat more than 3,300 locations.4 Of those, more than 3,200 were flash floods in small tributaries \nthat were intensified by extreme rainfall events caused by global climatic changes.5 Flash floods \nare common in the mountainous area of the PRC, which covers about two-thirds of the national \nterritory with a population of 900 million people, of whom the majority are in the YREB. About \n70% of total flood losses during 2000\u20132016 in the PRC were related to flash floods, which are \nspatially scattered and temporally variant.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 22 June 2018. \n2  Ministry of Water Resources. 2017.

Manila. \n4  The July 2016 flooding caused $28 billion in damage in the Yangtze River Basin and was the second most \nexpensive natural disaster in the PRC\u2019s history (Aon Benfield. 2016.

Beijing. \n6  Ministry of Water Resources. 2017. Flood Control, Drought Relief and Disaster Mitigation in China. Beijing. \n ", "2 \n5.  In 2006, the State Council of the PRC launched the National Flash Flood Disaster \nPrevention Plan, whose targets included strengthening monitoring and early warning systems \nand  enhancing  national  and  local  preparedness  and  emergency  response  capacity.  The \ngovernment invested about CNY30 billion in national flash flood disaster prevention projects \nduring 2010\u20132016. As a result, the average annual flash flood disaster-related fatalities dropped \nfrom 1,100 in 1990 to 400 in 2015. In 2017, the MWR issued the National Flood Disaster \nPrevention  Project  Implementation  Plan,  2017\u20132020  to  further  consolidate  the  flash  flood \ndefense system by focusing on preventive, nonstructural measures.7 To further reduce human \ncasualties and economic loss from flash floods, the plan should additionally consider a variety of \nexposure and vulnerability factors, including land use changes, climate change, uncertainty of \ntemporal and spatial distributions of flash floods, accuracy and localization of the early warning \nsystems for emergency response, and community engagement. \n \n6.  In most of the previous flash flood events, excessive damage was attributed to the lack \nof spatial or temporal coverage of the available early warning systems and the gaps in the end-\nto-end early warning systems that should have involved the following six interactive elements: (i) \nrisk  knowledge,  (ii)  monitoring  and  data  acquisition,  (iii)  forecasting  and  warning,  (iv) \ndissemination  and  communication,  (v)  information  type  and  reliability,  and  (vi)  response \ncapacity. While the PRC is pioneering flood preventive measures, forecasting and early warning \nsystems in general are still at their primary stage of development. The challenges in establishing  \nreliable flash flood early warning systems in the PRC are as follows: (i) the national flash flood \ndisaster prevention plan is being implemented on a coarse spatial scale and has not yet been \nspecialized for a large number of small river basins as well as scattered houses, villages, or \ntowns in remote geographical settings; (ii) weather nowcasts (a report on current weather \nconditions) are becoming more detailed and accurate, but they have yet to be employed to \nincrease the lead time in flood early warning; (iii) a large number of small basins are not being \nmonitored by hydrological and meteorological stations, making it difficult to develop reliable \nlocalized flash flood early warning systems; (iv) flood forecasting does not take soil moisture \nand geophysical conditions, including consecutive rainfall events, into account; (v) self-help and \nmutual help conditions are yet to be promoted through awareness campaigns and capacity \nbuilding activities in grassroots communities to improve the effectiveness of the early warning \nsystems;  (vi)  institutional  capacity  in  flood  forecasting  and  early  warning  within  local \ngovernments,  as  well  as  self-help,  mutual  help,  and  public  help  (mainly  rescue  operation \nconducted by authorities) conditions in grassroots communities, are not sufficient; and (vii) the \nelements  of  an  end-to-end  early  warning  system  are  yet  to  be  integrated  in  the  national \nprogram. Rapid socioeconomic development in the flash flood-prone areas urgently requires \nreliable flash flood forecasting and early warning systems and strong engagement of the local \ncommunities. \n \n7.  Considering the PRC\u2019s large and scattered mountain population, the government is yet \nto expand its flash flood early warning systems for each village to receive and respond to \nreliable  early  flood  warnings.  To  promote  nationwide  end-to-end  flash  flood  early  warning \nsystems, the government needs to develop an effective system incorporating the six interactive \nelements  (para.  6)  and  pilot-test  the  system  in  selected  river  basins.  The  TA  supports \ngovernment efforts to strengthen the flash flood early warning systems and will pilot-test the \nbest practices in (i)  one community in the Kongmu River  watershed, with a population of \n109,580,  in  Xinyu  City,  Jiangxi  Province;  and  (ii)  two  communities  in  the  Laoguan  River \nwatershed, with a population of 76,000, in Xixia County, Henan Province.

Beijing. \n ", "3 \nrepresent the small river basins in the middle reach of the YREB, are highly exposed to flash \nfloods, and were severely affected by the flash floods in 2016. \n \n8.  The TA will foster synergies in refining the national flash flood disaster prevention plan \nand promoting ecological civilization, with explicit targets in the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan, \n2016\u20132020.8 As part of the rural revitalization objective set by the government to enhance \nlivelihoods and attract investments in rural areas, the MWR will promote public security by \nestablishing end-to-end flash flood early warning systems and by supporting local governments \nin planning and implementing flood mitigation measures. The TA will demonstrate the new \nbenchmarks in implementing policies, strategies, and action plans in the YREB. \n \n9.  The TA builds on previous ADB engagements in water sector reform in the PRC.9 ADB \nhas put knowledge at the center of its operations in the PRC by (i) helping translate innovative \nideas into actual projects and programs for implementation; (ii) supporting transformative and \ndemonstrative projects and programs; and (iii) supporting institutional reform efforts. ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC calls for managing climate change and the \nenvironment, fostering knowledge  cooperation,  and  supporting  institutional  and governance \nreform.10 The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020,  which \nemphasizes integrated water resources management and climate change adaptation.11 The \ngovernment and ADB are proposing a strategic framework to support green development, with \nan emphasis on ecological conservation through environmental protection and rehabilitation of \nthe YREB (footnote 9). Support for climate change adaptation and water-induced disaster risk \nmanagement, particularly in the successful implementation of the flash flood early warning \nsystems, will serve as an anchor for future engagement in water sector development and \ninclusion in the PRC. \n \nIII.

Output 2: Capacity development for flash flood emergency response at local level \nenhanced. This output will include (i) establishing community-based flash flood early warning \nsystems, including developing the community organization and skills of the community members \nin  the  technical  and  nontechnical  aspects  of  emergency  response  operations;  and  (ii) \nimplementing  institutional  capacity  development  activities  for  local  governments,  including \nproviding technical training on hydrological modeling and operation and maintenance of the \nearly warning devices and equipment for emergency response operations at the community \nlevel. \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge on flash flood early warning systems disseminated. This \noutput will include (i) organizing workshops and training programs to share knowledge and \nexpertise on flash flood early warning systems; (ii) drafting policy recommendations for flash \nflood risk mitigation in the PRC; (iii) drafting an investment plan for the flash flood early warning \nsystems in the YREB; and (iv) disseminating acquired lessons through knowledge products. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, necessary data, office space, and other administrative support. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  and  will  (i)  recruit,  supervise,  and  evaluate  the  TA \nconsultants; (ii) organize a workshop in consultation with the executing agency; and (iii) provide \nstaff to act as resource persons in the workshop and training programs. The MWR will be the \nexecuting agency and will establish a leading group, chaired by the director of the MWR\u2019s \nInternational Economic and Technical Cooperation and Exchange Center. The leading group \nwill  comprise  members  from  the  International  Economic  and  Technical  Cooperation  and \nExchange Center; Research Center on Flood and Drought Disaster Reduction; Department of \nInternational Cooperation, Science and Technology; and other relevant agencies under the \nMWR and other relevant ministries, some of which are being established by the government.14 \nThe leading group will be responsible for the overall planning, coordination, and supervision of \nTA implementation at the project locations. With the director of the Research Center on Flood \nand  Drought  Disaster  Reduction  as  its  head  and  with  support  from  project  officers  and \nadministrative staff, the TA management office will supervise (i) the TA activities to be carried \nout  by  the  TA  consultants;  and  (ii)  day-to-day  operations  with  ADB,  consultants,  related \n                                                \n14 The Government of the PRC announced that the Ministry of Emergency (MEM) is currently being set up.The MEM \nwill probably be responsible for compiling and implementing emergency management plans and for organizing \nrescue and relief for disasters and workplace accidents. TA implementation may need to be closely coordinated \nwith the MEM. Detailed institutional setup and mandates, however, are not yet clear. \n ", "5 \nagencies, and local governments. The TA management office will also serve as the secretariat \nfor the leading group. \n \n16.  The local governments and relevant agencies, mainly the water resources bureaus in \nHenan  and  Jiangxi  provinces,  will  closely  coordinate  with  one  another  during  TA \nimplementation.
