INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Nepal requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  formulate  the  Commercial  Agriculture \nDevelopment Project.1 The TA was included in ADB\u2019s 2002 country program for Nepal,2 and a \nFact-Finding Mission was fielded from 1 to 12 July 2002. The Mission met with concerned \ngovernment  agencies,  bilateral  and  multilateral  development  partners,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and the private sector; traveled to the Eastern Region of Nepal to \ninteract with farmers; and conducted a stakeholder workshop to ascertain a cross-section of \nviews on the focus and scope of the proposed Project. Based on this consultation, the Mission \nreached an understanding with the Government on the objective, scope, cost estimates and \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Nepal continues to be one of the poorest countries of the world, with a per capita income of \n$249 per year.3 The country\u2019s population is 22.7 million, of whom 42% are below the poverty line \nand have an annual income of less than NRs4,400 (approximately $56) per capita. Poverty is \nwidespread but is predominantly a rural phenomenon, with over 90% of the country\u2019s poor living in \nrural areas. Agriculture is the primary employer of the labor force (about 80%), accounts for about \n40% of the national gross domestic product, but has largely remained subsistence and focused on \nfood crops. The total arable land in the country is 2.9 million hectares (ha), but, due to high \npopulation pressure, the average landholding is small (0.9 ha in 1990/91) and further diminishing. \nConsequently, growth in the agricultural gross domestic product, has been less than 2% annually \nthrough most of the last decade, and the upswing that was noted in 2000 (5%) has yet to stabilize.4 \n \n3.  Nepal exhibits a wide range of topography and climate across three major ecological \nzones: the plain areas (Terai), the hills, and the mountains. The diversity of temperature and \nrainfall5 in these regions offers a unique opportunity for growing a number of higher value crops \nsuch as vegetables, fruits, spices, tea, and nontimber forest products. The Government is fully \ncognizant of agriculture\u2019s importance in the country\u2019s economy and therefore developed, with \nADB assistance, a long-term growth plan for the sector, the Agriculture Perspective Plan,6 \nadopted in 1995. This plan recognizes agriculture as the engine of economic growth and the \nmeans to reduce the country\u2019s poverty; it espouses a prioritized package approach comprising \nthe  following  key  elements  (i)  infrastructure  (irrigation,  rural  roads,  and  electricity);  (ii) \nappropriate institutional framework; and (iii) access to priority inputs (fertilizer, seed, and credit). \nThe country\u2019s Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) further underlines the need to improve returns \nand incomes from agriculture through diversification into high-value crops, especially in areas \nthat have agroecological advantages and accessibility to key infrastructure. In many of these \nrespects, the Eastern Region is particularly well suited. This strategy of diversification to high-\nvalue  crops  and  commercialization,  including  the  integration  and  promotion  of  production, \npostharvest/processing, and marketing activities for increasing financial returns from agriculture, \nis supported by the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002-2007), the agriculture markets study,7 and the \n                                                 \n1  Listed in the Country Strategy and Program 2002 as \u201cIntegrated Agriculture Development Project,\u201d but the title was \nchanged during fact-finding at the Government\u2019s request to clarify the Project's intent and focus. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet) on 24 April 2002. \n3  National Population Census 2001. \n4  ADB. 2001.

", "2 \nrecommendations of the Agriculture Sector Performance Review.8 The latter has confirmed the \npotential for commercial production of high-value crops in many parts of Nepal and suggests \ncommercialization of agriculture as the key strategy for improving returns and incomes from the \nsector.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  study  has  additionally  highlighted  the \necological and infrastructure potential of the Central and Eastern regions to produce crops such \nas vegetables and vegetable seeds, spices, fruits, flowers, tea, and nontimber forest products. \n \n4.  Both the Government and its development partners have made substantial investments \nin the agriculture sector in the last two decades, and more than 200 projects have been \nimplemented, with support from ADB (about $350 million), the World Bank (about $170 million), \nand other multilateral and bilateral agencies (about $311 million).9 Compared with the other \nregions in the country, the Eastern and Central regions have received more investments from \nexternal agencies, particularly for rural development, agriculture, irrigation, and roads. As a \nresult,  many  hill  districts  and  hinterland  areas  of  these  regions  are  accessible  and  well \nconnected with major highways (East-West highway, North-South Mechi and Kosi highways) \nand feeder roads. In addition, three road projects are ongoing and one is in the pipeline, all of \nwhich will further improve connections within and between districts.10 Similarly, many irrigation \nsector projects have developed both groundwater and surface-based irrigation systems in these \nareas. The proposed Project will capitalize on previous and ongoing infrastructure investments \nto promote commercial agriculture in the region. \n \n5.  Major policy reforms were undertaken under the Second Agriculture Program Loan11 and \nthe fertilizer subsector was deregulated, fertilizer subsidies removed, and the private sector \nallowed to freely import and distribute fertilizers. Additionally, the Government removed the \ncapital cost subsidy on shallow tubewells and agreed to gradually rationalize the subsidy on deep \ntubewells and surface irrigation, and to privatize the Agriculture Inputs Corporation (previously the \nsole  public  sector  importer  and  distributor  of  fertilizers).  A  competitive  grant  system  was \nintroduced12 in 2001 to improve the effectiveness and quality of agricultural research. Policies \nand guidelines for implementing agriculture programs in partnership with NGOs and the private \nsector have been in place since 2001, and a group approach in farm-related activities has been \nencouraged by the Government, be it for water management or for management of crops or \nlivestock.  The  devolution  of  power  to  the  village  and  district  development  committees  for \nplanning and implementing agriculture programs is also planned for 2003 under the Local Self-\nGovernance Act of 1999. The overall policy environment therefore appears to be favorable for \npromoting high-value agriculture in partnership with farmers and the private sector. \n \n6.  The Eastern Region of Nepal has been identified as the project area because of its \naccessibility  to  main  highways  and  markets;  its  favorable  agroecological  environment  for \nproducing high-value crops;13 the increasing interest of the farming community in producing \nvegetables, fruits, and spices;14 and the opportunity for synergy with other external investments. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1993.

", "    3 \nThe Eastern Region consists of 5 Terai and 11 hill districts and has the highest population \ndensity (366 persons per square kilometer [km2]) in the country (more than double the average \ndensity of 158 persons/km2). While the region\u2019s overall Human Development Index of 0.484 is \nthe second highest among the five regions in Nepal, it is still low compared with neighboring \ncountries like India (0.571) and Pakistan (0.498).15 Also, many of the hill districts of the region \nare classified as food-deficit areas, and two of the Terai districts (Siraha and Saptari) are reported to \nbe at par in terms of poverty and deprivation indexes, with districts in the Midwestern Region (Humla \nand Jajarkot). Increasing economic returns to the farmers in this region through commercialization of \nhigh-value agriculture, is therefore very appropriate at this point in its development. \n \n7.  The Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction (October 2001) between the Government \nand ADB confirms continued support for implementation of the Agriculture Perspective Plan, \nwhich  aims  at  reducing  rural  poverty  through  increasing  agriculture  sector  production  and \nproductivity, and diversification to higher value crops. The 2002 Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate notes recent improvements in agricultural performance due to the improved policy \nenvironment, more market-oriented systems for inputs and outputs, and greater participation of \nstakeholders, and restates the continued strategy for support to poverty reduction through a \ncombination of accelerated, broad-based economic growth (especially of agriculture) and good \ngovernance. The proposed Project is therefore consistent with the Government\u2019s agriculture \npolicy and ADB\u2019s country and poverty reduction strategies, as enunciated in the Government\u2019s \nTenth  Five-Year  Plan,  the  Partnership  Agreement  on  Poverty  Reduction  between  the \nGovernment and ADB, and ADB\u2019s 2002 Country Strategy and Program Update. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The TA will assist the Government in designing an investment project suitable for external \nfinancing that will focus on enhancing income and employment opportunities through increased and \nsustainable commercialization of agriculture. It will promote production, processing, and marketing of \nhigh-value crops, and capacity building of all stakeholders in order to support and sustain the process. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The  TA  and  the  ensuing  Project  will  target  promoting  high-value  crop  production, \nimproving postharvest processes, and strengthening market development. Close attention will \nbe paid to identifying market failures in commercial agriculture, processing, and marketing that \nneed to be addressed through public investments, private sector participation, public-private \npartnerships, a conducive economic and policy environment, and strengthened capacity of both \nthe  public  and  private  sector  (including  NGOs)  to  deliver  inputs  and  support  services  for \ncommercialized agriculture production. Consideration will also be given to creating high-value \nproduction clusters to facilitate marketing and processing of products. \n \n10.  The main beneficiaries of the Project will be the farmers (including sharecroppers and \nwomen farmers) growing or interested in growing high-value crops such as vegetables, fruits, \nand spices, and entrepreneurs located in the identified high potential areas of the Terai and the \nhill districts of the Eastern Region. Since women constitute more than 75% of the agricultural \nlabor  force,  the  TA  will  identify  means  of  facilitating  their  full  participation  and  ensuring \ncommensurate benefits to them. The potential districts have been identified because of their \nagroclimatic suitability for high-value crop production, and the availability of irrigation and road \ninfrastructure created through previous government and external investments. The Project will \n                                                 \n15 See summary initial poverty and social analysis in Appendix 1 for more details. ", "4 \nincorporate  the  lessons  learned  from  past  projects  and  will  build  synergy  with  past  and \nupcoming investments in the sector, following the directives of the Tenth Five-Year Plan. \n \n11.  The key activities of the Project will include (i) technology development and dissemination to \nfarmers  and  entrepreneurs  for  high-value  crop  production,  postharvest  management,  and \nprocessing; (ii) market development including (a) market infrastructure especially for hinterland \nareas,  (b)  market  information  collection  and  dissemination  systems,  and  (c)  improved  market \nmanagement; (iii) capacity building for (a) farmers (both technical and organizational), and (b) \nservice providers (government agencies, local bodies, NGOs, and the private sector\u2015technical, \nmanagerial, and institutional); (iv) facilitating access to credit; (v) supplementing infrastructure funds \nfor local bodies/farmer associations to address critical gaps in existing facilities, for example, trail \nbridges;  and  (vi)  project  management  support  especially  for  improved  planning,  intersector \ncoordination, monitoring, and impact evaluation. The TA will be implemented using an effective \nparticipatory methodology to deal with the complexities and interdependencies inherent in the \nagricultural production sector and to ensure the full involvement and commitment of potential \nbeneficiaries and other stakeholders in developing the project design. A holistic approach will be \ntaken  including  consideration  of  issues  of  security,  decentralization  of  government  authority, \nenvironmental concerns, gender and social aspects, and competitiveness with external markets. \nBeneficiaries and other stakeholders will be identified early in the study. \n \n12.  The TA will prepare a project in 11 districts of the Eastern Region of Nepal including the \n6 hill districts of Dhankota, Ilam, Panchthar, Taplejung, Terathum, and Udayapur16 and all 5 \ndistricts of the Terai: Jhapa, Morang, Saptari, Siraha, and Sunsari. Consideration will be given \nduring  the  TA  implementation  to  the  inclusion  of  the  remaining  5  hill  districts  of  Bhojpur, \nKhotang,  Okhaldhunga,  Sankhuwasabha,  and  Solukhumbu,  but  this  will  be  subject  to  the \ncompletion of road links to these districts and other agreed upon eligibility criteria. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $825,000 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange \ncost is $510,000 and the local currency cost is $315,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $700,000 \nequivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $190,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  contribute  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of \n$125,000 equivalent to provide office accommodation, counterpart staff support, field transport, \nfacilities for seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses. The Government has \nassured the availability of counterpart services and facilities by the expected commencement date of \nthe TA. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The Government has \nbeen informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing an ensuing loan project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Department of Agriculture (DOA) will be the Executing Agency and will establish a \nTA implementation unit based in Kathmandu. DOA will appoint a full-time TA project coordinator \nand provide the unit with (i) sufficient counterpart and support staff for overall support; (ii) local \ntransportation  of  consultants  and  government  counterparts;  (iii)  office  space,  utilities,  and \nfurnishings; (iv) assistance with surveys, stakeholder workshops and participatory exercises; \nand (v) local communication facilities. DOA will also provide assistance for local transportation \nof  consultants  and  government  counterparts,  and  for  surveys,  stakeholder  workshops,  and \nparticipatory exercises. The TA project coordinator will coordinate TA implementation with concerned \ngovernment ministries and agencies, NGOs, the private sector, aid agencies, and other stakeholders \n                                                 \n16 These districts are all linked with the North-South and the East-West highway, which runs across the country.

The group will be chaired by the director \ngeneral of DOA and will consist of stakeholder representatives (including potential beneficiaries). \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over a 6-month period, from February 2003 to July 2003, and \nwill be in three phases (see implementation schedule in Appendix 3). Phase I (1 month) will prepare \na work plan, collect and review sector information including lessons learned, and use a local \ninstitution to undertake rapid rural appraisals and prepare a detailed poverty and social assessment. \nPhase II (3.5 months) will include participatory planning, fieldwork, project design, and development \nof individual components. Phase III (1.5 months) will finalize the preparation of the feasibility study \nfor an investment project. Three tripartite meetings will be organized during TA implementation (at \ninception, at midterm, and at the draft final report stage), to be chaired by the secretary of the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and attended by DOA, ADB, and the consultants. \n \n16.  A total of about 42 person-months of consulting services, including 18 person-months of \ninternational and 24 person-months of domestic consultants, will be recruited through a firm. The \ninternational  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  agriculture  project  management  including \nmonitoring and evaluation (team leader), (ii) agricultural economics, (iii) agricultural marketing and \nmarket information, (iv) postharvest and agribusiness development, (v) high-value crop production, \nand (vi) participatory planning and systems learning. The domestic consultants, to be provided by an \nassociating firm, will have experience in (i) institutional development and local governance (deputy \nteam leader), (ii) social development and gender (iii) market infrastructure architecture/engineering, \n(iv) agricultural research and extension, (v) on-farm water management, (vi) agricultural credit, (vii) \npartnership development, and (viii) environmental assessment. The international team leader and \nthe domestic deputy team leader will provide overall management of the consulting team. The \ngeneral terms of reference for the consultants are attached in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  A local institution will be recruited, in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB, \nfor the equivalent of 4 person-months to conduct a detailed rural and social analysis, review and \nconfirm the suitability of proposed project areas, identify stakeholders, and carry out a baseline \nsurvey. The institution will have extensive local experience and proven capacity to undertake \nthe said task. (A summary initial poverty and social analysis is given in Appendix 1). \n \n18.  Selection and engagement of the TA consultants will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will be selected using ADB's simplified \ntechnical proposal using quality and cost-based selection procedures. The TA will provide \nequipment such as computers and other office equipment, which the consultant will purchase in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment so procured will be handed over \nto DOA upon completion of the TA. The TA will also provide funds for workshops and surveys to \nbe  conducted  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  arrangements  suitable  to  ADB.  The \nconsultants will conduct at least two stakeholder workshops and prepare (i) an inception report \nat  the  end  of  Phase  I,  (ii)  an  interim  report  for  the  midterm  review  2  months  after  the \ncommencement of Phase II, (iii) a draft final report at the end of Phase II, and (iv) a final report \nat the conclusion of the consulting services. All reports will be submitted to the advisory group, \nthe Government, and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for preparing the Commercial Agriculture Development Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority in Country     Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in           Yes      \nPoverty Analysis?  Country Poverty Partnership Agreement? \n \nContribution of the sector/ subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal \nAgriculture accounts for 40% of the gross domestic product. The country ranks 129 out of 162 countries and has a \nhuman development index (HDI) of 0.48\u2015lower than the weighted average for South Asia (0.554). The HDI of rural \nareas (0.446) is much lower than the HDI of urban areas (0.616), and the gender-related development index (GDI) \nfollows the same pattern, with a GDI of 0.426 for rural and 0.605 for urban areas2. Similarly, the index for rural poverty \n(41.4) is almost twice as high as that for urban poverty (23.9) and it varies widely across ecological regions. The \npopulation growth rate increased from 2.1% in 1991 to 2.3% in 2001, with the increase concentrated in rural areas, rural \nwomen having more than twice as many children (4.4) as urban women (2.1). Lack of commensurate growth in \nemployment opportunities due to poor economic growth has forced many rural poor into subsistence activities on forest \nand marginal lands, often with negative environmental impacts. It is clear that in the context of Nepal, where about 80% \nof the labor force relies on agriculture for employment, no economic growth and poverty reduction are possible without \nimproving the performance of the agriculture sector. Attention and energy also need to be focused on fostering \nownership and competency among locally owned and managed farmer groups so that completed infrastructure is \nefficiently maintained and operated to increase agricultural productivity. The Tenth Plan envisages achieving pro-poor \ngrowth by giving top priority to agriculture and achieving broad-based growth through implementation of the Agriculture \nPerspective Plan. \n \nThe Terai areas of the Eastern Development Region have the highest population density (366 persons per square \nkilometer [km2]), more than double the average density of 158 persons per km2 for the whole of Nepal. While the \nEastern Development Region has the second highest HDI (0.484) of the five development regions, all of the hill districts \nunder the proposed Project are classified as food deficit areas.  The poverty and deprivation indexes of Siraha and \nSaptari (in the Terai) are comparable to Humla and Jajarkot of the Midwestern Development Region. In addition, at \nleast three of the hill districts (Ilam, Panchthar, and Taplejung) have identified pockets3 of poverty where lack of inputs, \ninadequate service provision, and poor market access have led to low levels of agricultural productivity and consequent \nlabor migration out of the area to India. Some of the lowest cropping intensities in the country occur in the eastern hill \ndistricts, and wide variations in cropping intensity have been reported in the proposed Terai districts as well. It is \nenvisaged to integrate the farmers from the hinterland into the mainstream economy so that they can benefit directly \nfrom the growth process by taking advantage of social and economic opportunities arising out of expanded market \nlinkages. Market collection centers are proposed to be developed in the rural hinterland with the intention of linking rural \nfarmers to the markets beyond their immediate village. The Project will promote income growth by motivating farmers to \nbe involved in the production, processing, and marketing of high-value crops and  will thereby contribute towards \nreducing poverty in the Eastern Development Region by creating opportunities through expansion of market linkages \nand facilities, and securing good returns on past investments on irrigation and rural road networks. The proportion of \nhouseholds that convert to high-value vegetable crop production will also impact on the nutritional status of the family \nand the region, through improved availability of fruits and vegetables. From a poverty vantage point, high-value crops \nhave been reported to be attractive for households with less than 0.25 hectare (ha) because of their short gestation \nperiods, high returns, and a regular source of income for poor households, when marketed. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Economic Growth \n                    Gender and Development \nThe proposed project districts include 11 districts in the Eastern Development Region where a supportive environment \nexists to open and expand marketing potentials. These include six hill districts (Dhankota, Ilam, Panchthar, Taplejung, \nTerathum, and Udayapur) and five Terai districts (Jhapa, Morang, Saptari, Siraha, and Sunsari,). Poverty pockets exist, \nboth across and within districts. In the Terai, the average farm size is larger (1.29 ha) than in the hills (0.77 ha). In \naddition, farms in the hills comprise on average four parcels that are often scattered, which has impeded efficient land \nuse and farm labor. Topographical constraints and resource endowments affect the face of poverty. Household food \nshortage and unemployment remain major risks to the majority of the people. Coping strategies include male migration \nto India in search of wage labor to meet demand for cash, with the result that women are saddled with additional \nresponsibilities, and become primary decision makers both at the household and farm level, especially among low-\n                                                 \n1   An initial poverty and social analysis for the proposed Commercial Agriculture Development Project was undertaken with the \nobjective of determining the scope of poverty and social/gender issues that will need to be addressed during the design process. \nThe initial poverty and social analysis entailed field visits to Morang and Sunsari districts in eastern Nepal, and consultations with \npotential beneficiaries and other stakeholders including line agency officials and representatives of local governance structures. \n2   UNDP 2001.

The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will identify such pockets, and determine total \npopulation and the mix therein, with a view to (i) assessing the distribution of benefits, direct and indirect, on different \ncategories of farmers, small and large, women, and disadvantaged groups; (ii) facilitating cooperation between traders, \nand women and men producers; and (iii) recommending establishing a market information system covering both formal \nand informal markets catering to literate and illiterate farmers. The TA will also identify the best locations for collection \ncenters and other market infrastructure and assess their feasibility. Such strategically located collection centers are \nintended to expand rural farmers\u2019 access to larger market centers, increase their access to information on marketing \nalternatives, and encourage better linkages between producers and manufacturers/traders of selected products in order \nto facilitate direct negotiation of prices and avoid exploitation by middlemen. The Project will ensure that small and \nmarginal farmers also participate and benefit from it by soliciting their participation in farmer groups (associations, \nwomen\u2019s groups, self help, and user groups) and building the organizational capacity of such groups to provide better \nservice to their members, and increasing their capability to manage risks themselves. The TA will assess the social \ncapital of farmer/user groups/organizations, including their structural characteristics, identify existing groups and assess \nhow they operate (membership recruitment, size, federations, and type of leadership roles), and identify group \norganizational strengthening needs. The capacity-building program for farmer groups would also explore mechanisms \nto increase the institutional capability of the group to network, establish market linkages, expand market information, \nand increase members\u2019 access to new techniques. In addition, differences will need to be considered between and \nwithin groups to ensure the largest coverage and equitable benefits. \n \nLow levels of human development in rural areas warrant a clear need for involving community-based organizations, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the private sector in working with the people. NGOs in the country vary \nconsiderably in their effectiveness and scope, and also their leanings. For those that are effective, their strength lies in \ntheir ability to provide intensive support and guidance, compared with what government departments provide (more \nthan two junior technical assistants per village development committee [VDC] compared with one junior technical \nassistant per 3-4 VDCs by the district agriculture department). Their major strength is their trust by local communities \nand their fluency in the local language. Their main weakness relates to \"politicization\" and dependency on one or two \nkey persons. The TA will need to assess the strength of existing community-based organizations and NGOs, especially \nthose operating in the region, in delivering services envisaged under the Project and also to develop modalities about \nhow they would complement the government effort. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis  \nSince stakeholders influence the achievement of project objectives, the TA will identify at the outset all potential \nstakeholders with a view to delineating primary and secondary stakeholders. This includes identification of groups and \nmay include but not be limited to farmer/user groups, cooperatives, local community-based organizations; individual \ntraders (wholesalers and retailers); representatives of local governance structures (VDC/district development committee \n[DDC]); central and district line ministries; locally based civil society organizations, farmer cooperatives, NGOs; and \numbrella groups representing members from the private sector such as local chapters of chamber of commerce. \nPoverty and social assessment teams will conduct field consultations over 1 month using rapid rural appraisal and \nparticipatory rapid assessment techniques, in addition to conducting base line surveys and gender analysis, identifying \nstakeholders, and initiating social mobilization. The TA will also assist in identifying individuals to represent the various \nstakeholder groups and ensure that they are represented in balance. The Project will apply a participatory and systems \nlearning approach involving stakeholders and their representatives so that the project design represents a consensus of \nall stakeholders. Two workshops will be conducted, one at the beginning of the fieldwork and the other at the end of the \nfieldwork to consolidate views and recommendations for the project design. \n \nParticipation strategy required                                                                                                                       No \n \n \nD.

Historically, these groups \nheld all agricultural land as common property with right to lease, but \nthis  system  of  land  ownership  was  abolished  in  1964  and \ncommunal  lands  was  assigned  to  individuals.  The  Indo-Aryan \npeople came later and are organized in an occupation based caste \nsystem prevalent in India, which places the Brahmin-Chettri group \n(traditional  teacher)  at  the  top  and  the  occupation  castes  like \ncobblers, tailors, and blacksmiths at the bottom. The project design \ncenters  on  detailed  social  analysis  and  participatory  systems \nlearning approach and therefore the process will ensure that issues \nand concerns of any ethnic minorities or disadvantaged groups are \naddressed and project benefits are equally accessed. \nOther Risks/  Nonsignificant  The effective use of participatory planning approaches will ensure  No \nVulnerabilities  full  participation  of  all  stakeholders  in  the  design  process  and \nthereby any potential risks or vulnerabilities will be addressed and \ncommitment and ownership ensured in the ensuing Project. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
