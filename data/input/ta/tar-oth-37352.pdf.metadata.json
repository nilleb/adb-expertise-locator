The  voluntary  working  group,  created  under  the  Forum  of  Finance  Ministers  of  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and \nRepublic of Korea (ASEAN+3) on Guarantee Mechanism for the Asian Bond Market Initiative \n(ABMI) has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the work of the group by \nconducting a study on guarantee mechanism in the region through technical assistance (TA).1  The \nuse of guarantees is thought of as one way of accelerating the development of domestic and \nregional bond markets in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). The design of the TA was \ndiscussed with the concerned countries at the working group meeting held in Hua Hin, Thailand, on \n10 July 2003. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The mismatch in maturity and currency between debt and revenue for borrowers in the \nregion intensified the effects of the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. Although the region \nhas experienced remarkable recovery, in the absence of a well-developed, efficient source of long-\nterm local currency, these mismatches remain as a major source of financial vulnerability in the \nregion. The ASEAN+3 and other forums, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), \nhave been trying to address this issue through the development of domestic and regional bond \nmarkets.  \n \n3.  The ABMI was endorsed at the ASEAN+3 deputies meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on 17 \nDecember 2002. The ABMI emphasizes the need for a joint and comprehensive set of actions by \nthe ASEAN+3 countries in two broad areas: (i) facilitating access to the market by a wide variety of \nissuers, and (ii) creating an environment conducive to developing domestic and regional bond \nmarkets. Six working groups have been set up to examine the factors necessary for bond market \ndevelopment.2  These working groups are expected to provide valuable input to the decision \nmaking by the finance ministers of ASEAN+3. ADB has been a member of the voluntary working \ngroup on guarantee mechanism for the ASEAN+3 since the group\u2019s inception in February 2003. \nThe working group was constituted against a background of recent impressive growth in the \nKorean bond market, which is attributable largely to the use of guarantees and securitization. This \nmodel, as well as other similar arrangements, may act as guide in accelerating the development of \nbond markets in ASEAN+3 countries. The use of guarantees could also assist in developing the \nintra-regional bond market and recycling the savings of the region to be used for developing \nregional  economies  so  that  they  may  become  less  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the  external \nenvironment.3  By bridging the risk perception gap, credit enhancement and structured products \nmay be used to encourage cross-border investment in the region as well as from international \ninvestors outside the region. Guarantees will be an intermediate measure and should be gradually \nreduced as investors become accustomed to structures and credit risk.   \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in June 2003.  \n2  Creating new securitized debt instruments (Thailand), credit guarantee mechanisms (Korea), settlement and exchange \nregulations (Malaysia), issuance of local currency bonds by nondomestic issuers (People\u2019s Republic of China), local \nand regional rating agencies (Singapore and Japan), and technical assistance coordination (Indonesia and Philippines). \nChair countries are noted in parenthesis. \n3  Foreign exchange risk can be minimized by matching the currency of revenue and issuance. Intraregional export \nreceivables  can  be  securitized  and  targeted  toward  the  market  of  the  receivable  denomination.  For  example, \nIndonesian exporters may securitize their Singapore dollar receivables to issue Singapore dollar bonds.    \n ", "2  \n4.  The voluntary working group has identified several domestic guarantee agencies, as well as \nbilateral and multilateral institutions that provide local currency guarantees. However, there are \nvery few guaranteed local currency bond transactions in the market. The reasons vary, from lack of \nmarket acceptance for the guarantee to structural hurdles caused by processing lead time. To \nutilize guarantees for catalyzing the accelerated development of the domestic and regional bond \nmarkets, the working group needs an in-depth study of the existing facilities and their performance, \nincluding the difficulties they may be facing.    \n  \n5.  Asian Securitization and Infrastructure Assurance Ltd. (ASIA Ltd.) was set up in 1995 with \nthe special mandate of helping bond market development in the region through the provision of \nbond guarantees.4  The company was hard hit by the Asian financial crisis and is now dormant. \nOther private sector guarantors from Asia have come and gone. A careful analysis of the factors \nthat resulted in these companies\u2019 failure to establish themselves in the region is pertinent when \nconsidering the efficiencies and pitfalls of guarantee facilities outcomes. The lessons learned, \nwhen compared with international best practices, are expected to provide valuable insights in \ndetermining the next course of action for Asian countries.   \n \n6.  Currently there is no best-practice model for guarantee facilities that can be readily applied \nto improve the effectiveness of the domestic or regional agencies. In this regard, a key mandate of \nthe working group in fact is to develop a model that may be used as a benchmark to examine the \nexisting facilities and suggest measures for improvement. This best-practice model may be applied \nas a benchmark not only for ASEAN+3 countries but also for other DMCs. It is however anticipated \nthat, even with all possible improvements, the existing agencies may not be sufficient to realize the \ndesired outcomes \u2014 to develop bond markets regionally \u2014 because of limitations resulting from \nthe organizational constraints of existing agencies. The potential and limitations of the facilities \nneed to be critically examined in establishing effective domestic and regional mechanisms for the \ndevelopment of bond markets.   \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The TA aims to identify, assess, and compare guarantee mechanisms that are appropriate \nto support the development of domestic and regional bond markets in the ASEAN+3 countries, \nparticularly Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. The TA will review existing and past \nmechanisms, and international and regional best practices, and will consider the most effective \nguarantee mechanism to foster development of an ASEAN+3 bond market.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  Through dialogue with institutions and market participants, as well as research into past \ndata,  the  study  will  evaluate  the  use  or  potential  application  of  such  guarantees  as  credit \nenhancement for bonds. Given the evolving nature of the capital markets, the design of the TA will \nbe kept reasonably flexible so that it can meet the emerging needs of the domestic and regional \nbond markets. ADB staff will work closely with the working group and the consultants to ensure \nthat the TA satisfies the objectives of the study. The consultants will liaise with other working \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1995.

The \nenvisaged TA will comprise five components. \n \n  1.   Existing Guarantee Facilities      \n \n9.  The study will first examine the domestic, private, bilateral, and multilateral guarantees \navailable to borrowers domestically and regionally. The structure and extent of the guarantee, the \neligibility of the borrower, acceptance by investors and lenders, flexibility, applicability to the bond \nmarket, and usage are some items that will determine effectiveness. The adequacy of the existing \nfacilities for the development of the bond market will be examined in close consultation with market \nparticipants. ADB and other organizations have done numerous studies on the bond markets in the \nregion. Those papers will be carefully examined. The TA will not duplicate work that has been done, \nbut will update and expand those studies.5 \n \n  2.   Previous Guarantee Mechanism \n \n10.  Guarantee facilities that have become inactive in or have ceased to exist in the region will \nbe studied to determine the reasons for their failure. The business model, the capital structure, \nproducts, and guarantee criteria will be the main areas covered. After the first component and this \ncomponent  are  completed,  a  presentation  will  be  made  to  the  working  group,  including  an \nassessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing facilities.   \n \n  3.   Best-Practice Model \n \n11.  From the examination and analysis of the existing facilities, previous structures, and select \nguarantee facilities outside the region, the TA will recommend a best-practice model for a domestic \nand  regional  guarantee  facility.  The  model  will  include  business  scope,  capitalization,  risk \nmanagement, credit evaluation, and staffing. The model will feature a robust structure capable of \nwithstanding macroeconomic shocks such as those that occurred during the Asian financial crisis.   \n   \n  4.   Improvements to the Existing Facilities  \n \n12.  The TA will compare existing domestic and regional facilities with the best-practice  model, \nwith  a  view  to  making  suggestions  for  improving  existing  facilities,  considering  the  specific \ninstitutional and country circumstances. \n                                                 \n5 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 1997.

Potential and Limitations of Existing Facilities \n    \n13.   Keeping in mind the suggested improvement and the possible time frame and costs for \nimplementing of the existing facilities, the TA will examine the potentials and limitations of possible \nimprovements  of  the  existing  facilities  and  consider  their  adequacy,  considering  the  need  to \ndevelop bond markets in the region without delay. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $455,000 in foreign \nexchange and $45,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. Appendix 2 gives the details of the TA cost. The members of the \nworking group have so far financed the costs of its preliminary activities, and will continue to \ncontribute to its ongoing operations costs. The chair of the working group (from the Ministry of \nFinance of the Republic of Korea) has engaged two capital market consultants to assist in the \npreliminary  studies,  and  the  Prime  Minister's  Adviser  for  Thailand  has  been  active  in  the \ndiscussions.  The  expenses  of  the  working  group  will  continue  to  be  borne  in  part  by  the \nparticipating countries. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented by ADB (in coordination with Southeast Asia Department, \nMekong Department, and Office of Cofinancing). In consultation with the chair of the working group, \nADB will supervise the work of the consultants.  \n \n16.  Under the TA, three international consultants in the fields of financial sector policy, bond \nmarkets, and guarantees, respectively, will be engaged for a total of 10 person-months. The \ninternational consultants will be supported by four domestic consultants from Indonesia, Malaysia, \nPhilippines,  and  Thailand  (8  person-months).  They  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  as  individual \nconsultants following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consulting Services and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consultants will have demonstrated \nand comprehensive experience related to bond markets and the development of such markets. \nThe bond market specialist will act as the team leader for the study, and will coordinate the \nactivities  of  the  two  other  international  consultants  and  the  four  domestic  consultants,  in \ncoordination  with  ADB  and  the  working  group.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices are presented in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  The TA will begin in September 2003 and will be completed by the end of April 2004. The \nconsultants will prepare (i) an inception report, within 1 month of the TA\u2019s start; (ii) an interim report, \nafter the completion of the first two components or within 4 months; (iii) a draft final report, within 5 \nmonths; and (iv) a final report on completion of the study. A draft of the interim report will be \ncirculated for comments to the working group members. Upon receipt of the feedback on the draft \nreport on the first two components, a presentation seminar will be arranged for the working group \naround January 2004. A draft final report with all five components will be circulated to the working \ngroup in February for comments. Upon receipt of the feedback, a second seminar will be arranged \nto present the final report to the working group in April 2004. The report will be used for further \ndiscussions and consideration of concrete actions for developing domestic and regional guarantee \nmechanisms to facilitate the accelerated expansion of the bond market in the ASEAN+3 countries. \n \n ", "  5\nIV.
