Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including microenterprises in rural areas, \nconstitute a vast portion of Cambodia\u2019s real economy in terms of the number of firms (99%) and \nemployment (45%). Recognizing the importance of SMEs, the Government of Cambodia (the \nGovernment) emphasizes their potential to increase investment, generate employment, and \nreduce poverty. The Government therefore requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nassist in SME development.1 Accordingly, the Cambodia SME Development Program (CSDP), \napproved in 2004, aims to prompt institutional reforms to support the development of SMEs.2  \n \n2.  As outlined in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1, technical assistance \n(TA) aims to support CSDP implementation, particularly concerning the third tranche release \npolicy conditions. It also aims to continue ADB\u2019s support for capacity-development efforts by the \nGovernment and aid coordination related to the SME sector. The Fact-Finding Mission fielded in \nOctober 2005 reached an understanding with the Government on the purpose, approach, and \nimplementation arrangements of TA.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Cambodian SMEs face a number of significant challenges, among them governance and \nregulatory reform. A key challenge is to create an enabling business environment that minimizes \nthe risks and costs of doing business, which in turn offers better protection of property rights and \nopens  up  the  scope  of  opportunities  for  entrepreneurs.  Creating  a  conducive  business \nenvironment requires addressing problems related to missing or poorly functioning institutional, \nlegal, and regulatory structures that impair the larger part of the Cambodian economy, SMEs. \nThe  following  paragraphs  discuss  the  major  challenges  that  SMEs  face,  achievements  of \ncurrent CSDP implementation, and remaining tasks.4  \n \n4.  Limited Capacity for Implementing the SME Development Framework. In July 2005, \nas part of the CSDP second tranche, the Government issued for the first time a comprehensive \npolicy strategy for SME development\u2014the SME Development Framework (SMEDF). To support \nimplementation, the Government established the SME subcommittee and its secretariat office.5 \nThe subcommittee prepares an annual report on the status of the SME sector and continuously \nreviews the SMEDF. While the adoption of the SMEDF marks significant progress for policy \ncoordination  and  institution  building,  implementing  its  action  plan  still  faces  considerable \nchallenges.  Furthermore,  although  the  SME  subcommittee  should  promote  interagency \ncoordination, considerable support is needed to enhance the capacity of the subcommittee and \nits secretariat to undertake the necessary tasks.  Furthermore, improving data collection on \nSMEs will require work with the Ministry of Planning\u2019s National Institute of Statistics (NIS). NIS \n                                                 \n1  This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 7 February 2006.  \n2  The issues addressed in the CSDP (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Cambodia SME Development Program. Manila \n[approved on December for $20 million]) include the following: (i) policy framework for SME development, including \nan institutional coordination mechanism; (ii) reforms on business registration and licensing systems; and (iii) \nspecific reforms to enhance SMEs\u2019 access to finance, including accounting, leasing, and credit information. Along \nwith the loan, TA 4476-CAM (ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Capacity \ndevelopment  for  SME  Development.  Manila)  was  approved  for  $850,000.    TA  4476-CAM  supported  the \nGovernment on the CSDP\u2019s second tranche conditions. \n3  The mission composed of J. Cyhn (economist) and J. Farinha (financial economist), both of the Governance, \nFinance, and Trade Division of the Mekong Department. \n4  An outline of the third tranche policy conditions of the CSDP is in Appendix 2.  \n5  The subcommittee is headed by the head of the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy.   \n ", "2     \nneeds capacity development to support data gathering useful to developing SME policies. In \naddition, ADB needs to continue being proactive in facilitating aid coordination and consultation, \nfollowing a request by the Government for ADB to serve as the focal donor agency for SME \ndevelopment. Finally, effective monitoring is necessary to ensure continuous evaluation of the \nSMEDF.  \n \n5.  Barriers to Effective Business Registration. Business registration reform is deemed \nnecessary in Cambodia. Many Cambodian SMEs are not registered and operate informally \nbecause of red tape and the high cost of registration. To meet CSDP first and second tranche \npolicy conditions, the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) introduced measures to simplify the process \nand significantly reduce costs. The average number of companies registering each month has \ndoubled  since  the  reforms  were  implemented  in  September  2004.  To  further  improve  the \nregistration process, MOC needs significant technical support and capacity development to (i) \ndecentralize the registration process (currently, enterprises can register only at the MOC office \nin Phnom Penh); (ii) develop an information technology (IT)-based system allowing MOC to \nmaintain and update the records of registered enterprises; and (iii) reaffirm the reforms by \nrefining the legal framework and engaging in publicity campaigns. \n \n6.  Lack of Capacity to Implement Business Licensing Reform. Many studies carried \nout in Cambodia have identified opaque and complicated procedures for obtaining licenses and \nthe heavy burden of inspections as major obstacles in the business environment, resulting in \nexcessive costs for entrepreneurs. A number of case studies indicate that a typical SME in \nCambodia may have to pay about $1,500 in formal and informal fees, without clear justification \nfor the licensing requirements or any predictability of its cost. This clearly illustrates the need for \ntransparency, good governance, and administrative efficiency to promote SME development. \nCurrently,  as  part  of  the  CSDP  second  tranche  conditions,  ADB  is  helping  the  SME \nsubcommittee develop an overall framework for business licensing reform. As a comprehensive \nlicensing  reform  plan  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  Government  in  May  2006,  the \nsecretariat will require significant capacity development to ensure that the plan, which includes \nestablishing a one-stop information window on business licenses, is effectively implemented. \nThe subcommittee will need to continue reviewing numerous licenses and begin the process of \nbuilding capacity at relevant ministries to enable them to carry out in the future their own \nregulatory impact assessments, which estimate the economic and financial costs and benefits of \nregulations.  \n7.  Limited Capacity for Implementing Accounting and Taxation Reforms. Studies on \nfinancing SMEs in Cambodia found that the quality and availability of financial information on \nSME borrowers ranges from minimally acceptable to wholly nonexistent. One of the reasons for \nthis  lack  of  financial  information  is  that  SMEs  are  generally  unable  to  prepare  financial \nstatements and provide information relevant to the needs of lenders. As per the CSDP second \ntranche, ADB has been helping the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and private sector \nrepresentatives develop a set of simplified financial reporting guidelines for SMEs, as current \nCambodian  accounting  standards  are  deemed  to  be  overly  complicated  for  most  small \nenterprises. However, even if the simplified guidelines are completed and issued by the relevant \nauthorities, support is needed to effectively raise awareness among SMEs and train accounting \nprofessionals.  \n8.  Absence of Legal and Institutional Framework for Leasing. One major obstacle to \nSMEs is the almost complete lack of access to medium- and long-term financing. Leasing offers \nan alternative form of finance, which relies more on the cash flow of SMEs than on collateral. \nPer the CSDP second tranche, ADB has been helping the Government, mainly the National \n ", "  3\nBank of Cambodia (NBC), to draft a law on leasing and so establish the necessary legal \nframework. This complements other supportive infrastructure, such as the draft law on secured \ntransactions,  being  developed  in  Cambodia.  However,  considerable  support  is  needed  to \nensure  that  all  related  implementing  regulations  are  in  place  and  effectively  implemented. \nCapacity development and dissemination is required to support industry\u2019s development.  \n \n9.  Capacity Development to Operate and Expand the Credit Information System. The \nlack  of  reliable  borrower  credit  information  is  a  major  contributor  to  the  high-risk  lending \nenvironment in Cambodia.  Per the CSDP second tranche, ADB has been working with NBC \nand the Association of Bankers in Cambodia (ABC) to develop, on a pilot basis, a web-based \ncredit information system. NBC is also preparing a new prakas (regulation issued by a line \nministry) to provide the necessary legal framework for a credit information system. Furthermore, \nparticipating banks, ABC, and NBC are preparing a code of conduct outlining the rights and \nresponsibilities of members. Despite these efforts to build the governance structure of the credit \ninformation system, success ultimately depends on its swift implementation and the effective \nfunctioning of the system from the outset. Considerable technical guidance is necessary to \nensure that the system is effectively administered and efficiently utilized by participating banks \nand that the code of conduct is implemented, ensuring system integrity.   \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  As stated above, the major objective of the CSDP is to assist the Government in \ncreating a regulatory environment conducive to SME development. This will be achieved by \nhelping the Government to effectively implement the SMEDF and CSDP. In addressing the \nmain issues identified above, TA will provide (i) technical support, (ii) capacity development, (iii) \nsupport  for  consensus  building  and  aid  coordination,  and  (iv)  evaluation  of  the  current \nachievements. The major outcomes are outlined below. \n \n11.  Supporting SMEDF Implementation. As the SMEDF was approved in July 2005, the \nSME subcommittee and secretariat will need to review and possibly update it by the end of 2006. \nThey will also need continued support to assist in coordinating the activities of stakeholders \ninvolved in implementing the SMEDF. Improving data collection on SMEs will require working \nwith NIS. Collecting relevant data is critical to evaluating the performance of the SMEDF. A \nspecific set of monitorable indicators will be developed and tested through available data and \nfield surveys. Accordingly, TA should develop NIS\u2019s capacity for data gathering. TA should also \nhelp the SME secretariat improve dissemination of relevant information to SMEs through its \nportal  site  and  other  means.  Further,  TA  will  analyze  the  commercial  legal  framework  for \nCambodia,  particularly  with  regard  to  property  rights  and  commercial  arbitration,  which  is \nemphasized in the SMEDF. Finally, TA, in conjunction with other donor agencies, will develop \nspecific action plans to ensure that the reforms as stipulated in the SMEDF and CSDP have \nimpact locally and provincially as well.   \n12.  Strengthening  Business  Registration  Reform.  Based  on  the  reforms  undertaken \nduring 2004\u20132005, three major tasks for reforming business registration are anticipated for \n2006. The first challenge will be to complete the implementation of reforms to registration \nprocedures  and  fees  that  are  outlined  in  MOC\u2019s  time-bound  plan,  by  issuing  relevant \nimplementing regulations. The second challenge will be to expand the role of IT in the company \nregistration  process  according  to  a  time-bound  plan.  MOC  also  needs  to  issue  a  prakas \nestablishing a system for online exchange of registration data between Phnom Penh and the \n ", "4     \nprovinces. The third major challenge for 2006 will be to implement decentralization reforms. \nThese should be rolled out in one or more pilot provinces, allowing companies to register with \nthe provincial department of commerce. This process will be consistent with the Government\u2019s \nStrategic Framework for Decentralization and Deconcentration.  \n \n13.  Initiating  Business  Licensing  Reform.  Sustainable  licensing  reform  requires \nestablishing an administrative recourse mechanism. In 2006, it will be necessary to implement \nthe recourse mechanism provided for in the regulatory review plan, a process that will require \ncapacity building. The CSDP and SMEDF also provide for Government approval of the design \nof a one-stop information window dispensing relevant information and guidelines on licensing \nand  inspection.  The  SME  subcommittee  and  secretariat  will  need  technical  assistance  for \ndeveloping the legal requirements, business processes and IT necessary to develop the window.  \nThis requires placing emphasis on the Government\u2019s enforcement capacity and bureaucratic \naccountability \n14.  Implementing Accounting and Taxation Guidelines for SMEs. Although a simplified \nfinancial reporting template is expected to be issued by early 2006, some concern remains that \nnot  all  SMEs,  particularly  the  smaller  enterprises,  will  be  able  to  complete  the  template. \nAccordingly, the need exists to build the capacity of accountants with the knowledge and skill to \nprepare financial statements for SMEs. A thorough study of the capacity of local institutions to \nprovide  technical  training  courses  will  be  undertaken,  and  a  concrete  action  plan  for \nstrengthening accounting curricula proposed. Secondly, TA will identify specific ways to support \nthe capacity of accounting professionals, including support for educating future accountants. \nFinally, TA will include a detailed study of ways to improve the current taxation system, in \nconjunction with other relevant donor agencies, particularly the International Monetary Fund.  \n \n15.  Expanding  the  Credit  Information  System.  Once the credit information system is \noperational, TA will support its operations and further development, including developing user \nmanuals and providing extensive training to participating banks on how to use the system. In \nconjunction with NBC and ABC, TA will continue to review existing legislation with the purpose \nof developing an enabling legal framework. TA will also develop a detailed action plan for \nexpanding the credit information system, based on the lessons learned from the experience of \nthe pilot system. Finally, as the credit information system, however important it may be, is only \none  pillar  of  a  developed  banking  industry  that  uses  IT  to  enhance  its  effectiveness  and \nefficiency,  banks  will  require  other  important  IT-reliant  institutional  underpinnings.  TA  will \nanalyze IT needs for a more efficient banking sector.  \n  \n16.  Promoting  Leasing  Development.  Leasing  continues  to  be  virtually  unknown  in \nCambodia as a financial product. To address this, TA will attempt to make finance leasing an \nattractive product in Cambodia. Firstly, TA will support, in consultation with the NBC and MOC, \ncompletion of the leasing law and make recommendations for implementing it. Secondly, TA will \nliaise with the Tax Department to examine ambiguities in the Law on Taxation that affect the \nleasing environment and make recommendations for clarifying them. Thirdly, TA will provide \ncapacity  development  to  support  enhancing  technical  skills  through  training  programs  for \nGovernment officers, bankers, and SMEs. Finally, TA will hold frequent discussions with the \nprivate sector to further identify ways to promote the development of the leasing industry in \nCambodia.  \n \n ", "  5\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  TA will fund consultants with expertise in the areas identified for implementing reforms. \nThe team of consultants will conduct in-depth consultations with the Government and private \nsector stakeholders. Consultations will be part of the process to produce targeted outputs and \nwill  be  followed  by  a  number  of  roundtable  discussions  and  workshops  to  transfer  the \nknowledge and skills all stakeholders need to implement the policy conditions under the CSDP \nand SMEDF. ADB will monitor the process closely to ensure the quality of outputs and training. \nIn addition to the technical inputs, TA will support the Government\u2019s capacity development to \nensure that reforms are sustainable.  \n \n18.  The consultants will prepare a detailed work plan before the start of services, which will \ninclude a timetable for deliverables defined under each component of TA. They will be required \nto submit interim reports meeting deadlines specified in the work plan agreed with ADB. All \nreports will be reviewed by the Government and ADB. Tripartite meetings will be held before \nfinalizing the draft reports. The final report, incorporating comments from the Government and \nADB, will be submitted upon completion of service.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  TA is estimated to cost $950,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance $800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $150,000  equivalent  by  providing \ncounterpart  staff,  office  space,  administrative  services,  and  physical  facilities.  The  cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  To facilitate TA implementation, ADB has requested that the CSDP steering committee \nremain to oversee implementation. The committee is headed by the head of the Ministry of \nIndustry, Mines, and Energy, the Executing Agency. The implementing agencies include MEF, \nNBC, MOC, and Ministry of Planning. TA will be implemented over 13 months, from May 2006 \nto  May  2007  and  require  seven  international  consultants  for  27  person-months  and  eight \ndomestic consultants for 44 person-months. The consultant team will produce an inception \nreport, two interim reports, and a draft final report\u2014each report to be discussed in tripartite \nmeetings.  \n \n21.  Due to the diverse skill requirements of TA, consultants will be recruited as individuals in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. Procurement \nunder TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The equipment to be \npurchased under TA includes computer and other office equipment, which, upon TA completion, \nwill be disposed of according to ADB guidelines. Outline terms of reference are provided in \nAppendix 4.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.
