In 2003, the Government of Bangladesh requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Second Command Area \nDevelopment Project (CADP), which was included in the 2004 Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate.1  An  ADB  fact-finding  mission  visited  Bangladesh  from  12  to  17  March  2005  and \nconsulted  with  representatives  of  the  Government,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other \ndevelopment partners.2 The mission reached understanding with the Government on the purpose, \noutputs, methodology, key activities, cost, financing, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the TA. The executing agency, the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), \nsubmitted its own prefeasibility study report for the Project to ADB on 31 October 2005. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   Water resources management is critically important for Bangladesh\u2019s agriculture, which \nfaces the challenges inherent in intensifying agriculture and maintaining self-sufficiency in food \ngrains for a land-scarce country with a population of 130.0 million people, expected to increase \nto  175.0  million  by  2025.  Access  to  water  and  its  effective  management  for  agricultural \nproduction is fundamental to the livelihood of the rural population. To address this issue, the \nnational water policy (NWP), approved by the Government in 1999, sets new paradigms for the \nwater  sector  that  include  participatory,  integrated,  and  decentralized  water  management \nthroughout the planning, implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) stages of \ndeveloping water resources infrastructure.  \n \n3.  To respond to the NWP, in March 2004, the Government approved the National Water \nManagement  Plan,  which  has  three  main  categories  of  programs:  cross-cutting  programs, \nnational-level programs, and regional programs. The cross-cutting programs include institutional \ndevelopment and the creation of an enabling environment conducive to efficient and equitable \nwater  resources  management,  whereas  the  regional  programs  focus  on  a  participatory, \nintegrated approach to water management and on enhanced management of existing public \nflood control, drainage, and irrigation (FCDI) schemes.  \n \n4.  The NWP provides the directives and guidelines for fundamental reforms in the water \nsector and its key institutions. BWDB has made a good start toward achieving the objectives of \ndecentralization,  developing  multidisciplinary  skills,  promoting  beneficiary  participation,  and \nensuring transparency and accountability in its operations. It has reduced its staff from 18,000 to \n9,000 and improved management efficiency by adopting the 2000 BWDB Act. The Government \nhas gradually increased O&M funds from $10.0 million in 2001 to $24.0 million in 2005. In 2005, \nBWDB  allocated  its  limited  O&M  budget  based  on  the  performance  of  FCDI  schemes  by \nintroducing a newly developed management information system into two priority schemes in \neach zone in 2005 and to all large schemes in 2008. However, full implementation of these \nreforms will need long-term support to produce widespread, tangible results.4 \n \n5.  Having beneficiaries participate in and contribute to O&M is a core strategy for achieving \nthe  sustainability  of  water  infrastructure.  To  this  end,  in  2002  the  Government  formulated \nguidelines for participatory water management pertaining to ownership transfer, management \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006): Bangladesh. Manila.  \n2  Prior to the fact-finding mission, a reconnaissance mission was fielded from 28 November to 9 December 2004. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 23 November 2004. \n4  Specifically  for  O&M,  investments  are  required  in  (i)  training  BWDB  staff,  (ii)  establishing  modern  O&M \nmanagement information systems, and (iii) establishing a staff performance evaluation system. ", " 2   \ntransfer, and joint management. Currently 5,809 water management organizations (WMOs) \nhave been formed under 28 schemes, but these WMOs will need sustained support to develop \nfully. To support the BWDB Act, in 2003, the Government approved regulations for collecting \nirrigation  service  fees,  which  enable  the  Government  to  field-test  innovative  beneficiary \nparticipation methodologies. The regulations introduce a system and procedures for collecting \nfees for irrigation services in completed FCDI schemes and for ensuring that the responsible \nagency has put in place a system to provide irrigation services to beneficiary groups and has \nthe resources to do so. An improved O&M system can become effective only after infrastructure \nhas become functional and productive. No beneficiary participation can be expected if the \ninfrastructure has become dysfunctional because of lack of proper maintenance in the past. \n \n6.  As noted in ADB\u2019s review of the water sector in July 2003, public investment in water \nresources management has focused primarily on mitigating the negative effects of annual floods \nand river erosion. In total, more than $3.0 billion has been spent on water infrastructure in 639 \nFCDI schemes. More than 13,000 kilometers of embankments incorporating 1,300 water control \nstructures and about 3,500 kilometers of drainage canals have been constructed. The sector \nreview identified major issues pertaining to water resources management, namely, unfinished \nreform  of  key  water  sector  institutions  and  poor  sustainability  of  benefits  resulting  from \ninadequate O&M. \n \n7.  The sector review gave the highest priority to a program to sustain the existing water \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  make  it  more  efficient  so  that  the  country  could  realize \neconomic benefits of past investments in the water resources management facilities as a result. \nA program of portfolio rationalization of BWDB, along with institutional reforms, would produce \nmaximum  benefits  from  past  investments,  and  a  system  has  to  be  put  in  place  so  that \ninfrastructure is sustained through adequate O&M.5 To achieve this goal, a phased, sectorwide \napproach is needed along with the Government\u2019s long-term commitment for the O&M.   \n \n8.  In 2005, based on the sector review, the results-based Country Strategy and Program \nfor Bangladesh identified the development of a sustainable irrigation system as a priority for \nboosting  agricultural  productivity  and  encouraging  livelihood  diversification.  The  Country \nStrategy and Program supports the basic principles of integrated water resources management, \nsustainable  service  delivery,  and  user  participation  in  water  management.  In  addition  to \nproviding assistance for efficient public investment in large and small-scale water management \nsystems,  ADB  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  decentralize  system  design  and \nmanagement  and  foster  sustainable  O&M  by  encouraging  stakeholder  participation  and \nempowerment, integrating service delivery with other development services, and enhancing \nopportunities for disadvantaged groups to have access to irrigation. ADB support for developing \nlarger irrigation systems will hinge on satisfactory implementation of the NWP. \n \n9.   The  Government\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  highlights  water  resources \nmanagement as a priority for targeted pro-poor growth. The participatory, integrated approach \nto water management has demonstrated that the rehabilitation of existing FCDI schemes can be \ncomplemented  by  targeted,  poverty-focused  interventions  through  small-scale  fisheries  and \ncrop diversification activities. The integrated approach could further channel limited resources to \nbenefit vulnerable groups. Mapping where the poor are concentrated would help measure \ngeographic inequalities in well-being. Such poverty maps could identify pockets of poverty, \nthereby helping to identify target areas for schemes and livelihood activities for the Project. \n                                                 \n5  Portfolio rationalization refers to prioritizing BWDB\u2019s investment program based on the National Water Management \nPlan. ", "    3\n10.  The Government\u2019s recent policy actions reflect a bold, new commitment to sustainable \nwater resources infrastructure. The major development partners in the water sector in addition \nto ADB\u2014the World Bank and the Government of the Netherlands\u2014are working in partnership to \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  reform  of  BWDB  and  of  its  policies  for  participatory  water \nmanagement and cost recovery. The Government\u2019s approach to integrated water resources \nmanagement will also support the national poverty reduction strategy in poorer rural areas. \nUnderstanding from experience that sustainability depends on effective beneficiary involvement \nin O&M, the Government is committed to moving forward in implementing the new policies. \nEffective implementation will require sustained and well-coordinated support by its development \npartners in the coming years. \n \n11.  To support sustainable O&M of water resources facilities, under a twinning arrangement \nbetween BWDB and the Government of the Netherlands for 2001\u20132005, a 5-year action plan \nwas prepared to improve O&M performance through stakeholder participation and strengthened \ninstitutional capacity. The action plan aims to improve O&M procedures and methods, financing \nand budget allocation, and monitoring and evaluation. Implementation of the action plan will \nbegin with pilot testing in selected zones and will require close monitoring of the outcomes.  \n \n12.  One lesson learned from the CADP was that inadequate and deferred O&M in large \nirrigation systems had seriously compromised the effectiveness of the schemes.6 Even if a \nsystem for collecting service charges for irrigation was introduced, beneficiaries were reluctant \nto pay service charges if they did not obtain satisfactory irrigation services in return. In addition \nto the challenges of rehabilitation, the large schemes face the challenge of ensuring proper \nO&M  in  the  future  with  contributions  from  beneficiaries  under  the  auspices  of  a  joint \nmanagement committee (JMC). Thus to achieve the full benefits of water infrastructure, proper \nrehabilitation is needed along with a system for collecting service charges. For this purpose, a \nparticipatory  approach  can  establish  a  sustainable  system  for  water  and  infrastructure \nmanagement. However, WMOs require long-term institutional support for planning, investment, \nand business management. ADB\u2019s special evaluation study on the effectiveness of participatory \napproaches7 found that control of resources is the most critical factor, as it determines the \nlocation of decision-making power and enables beneficiaries to hold providers accountable. \nCompared with past institutional development of WMOs and capacity strengthening efforts by \nADB and other donors, a JMC introduced in 2002 under the CADP has showed positive impacts \nas a sustainable water management system. However, JMCs\u2019 roles and responsibilities need to \nbe  extended  and  their  links  with  existing  local  government  institutions  have  to  be  further \nstrengthened. \n \n13.  Lessons learned from the CADP show that to fully use the potential of past investments, \ncommand area development needs to strengthen service delivery under a joint management \nsystem and that project design should include water control, flood control, and river erosion \nmitigation measures to fully exploit the benefits of large FCDI schemes. In addition, project \nbeneficiaries need to be involved in project planning and detailed design aspects of the Project. \nAn  integrated  approach  to  water  resources  management  is  recommended  to  improve  the \nefficiency of infrastructure through improved coordination among all relevant agencies. All these \nwill be reflected in the project design and the feasibility study for the proposed Project.  \n \n \n The views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1995.

The overall goal of the TA is to enhance rural livelihoods by improving integrated water \nresources management through implementation of the NWP in selected FCDI schemes. The \noutcome of the TA will be a feasibility study of the selected FCDI schemes and an investment \nproject  proposal  for  possible  ADB  financing  to  implement  participatory  water  management \nprinciples corresponding to the NWP\u2019s priorities. The possible project activities may consist of (i) \ninstitutional development of BWDB; (ii) institutional strengthening of WMOs and JMCs; (iii) \nimprovement of service delivery by means of improved flood control, drainage, irrigation, and \nriver erosion mitigation facilities; (iv) integrated agriculture and fisheries development; and (v) \npoverty-focused interventions and other water-related livelihood support.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will prepare a feasibility study of three or four schemes selected from the nine \nlarge irrigation schemes recommended by the Government. The TA has two phases. The first \nphase is a prefeasibility study to select the project schemes. The second phase is a feasibility \nstudy of the selected schemes to prepare an investment proposal. The TA will ensure the \nparticipation  of  diverse  stakeholders  in  the  TA  and  the  subsequent  project,  including \nbeneficiaries, local government institutions, and people likely to be affected, along with that of \nnongovernment organizations. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. Intensive \ncollaboration with other development partners will be maintained to ensure the complementarity \nof interventions in the sector, as well as to explore possibilities for cofinancing the Project. \n \n16.  Phase 1 (4 Months), Selection of Project Schemes. Based on BWDB\u2019s prefeasibility \nstudy of nine FCDI schemes, the TA will prepare a detailed prefeasibility study to select three or \nfour  schemes  of  the  nine  schemes,  namely,  the  Monu  River,  Karnafuli,  Mufuri,  Ganges-\nKobadak,  Teesta,  Chandpur,  Kurigram  south  and  north,  and  Sirajganj  schemes.  The \nconsultants will prepare selection criteria for the prefeasibility study, undertake the prefeasibility \nstudy,  and  recommend  schemes  for  the  feasibility  study.  The  consultants  will  review  and \nrecommend institutional reforms of BWDB for sustainable O&M through a joint management \nsystem.  \n \n17.  Phase 2 (10 Months), Feasibility Study of Selected Schemes. The TA will undertake \na  feasibility  study  and  prepare  an  investment  project  to  implement  the  identified  priority \ninterventions.  These  interventions  will  strengthen  participatory  water  management  in  the \nselected,  large  FCDI  schemes  to  introduce  a  sustainable  water  management  system  by \nmobilizing  local  resources  under  a  joint  management  system.  The  Project  will  ensure \nsustainable O&M, capacity building of BWDB and JMCs, specific benefits to the poor, and \nenhanced service delivery to beneficiaries. Environmental, social, gender, resettlement, and \neconomic assessments will be prepared in accordance with Government and ADB guidelines. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million equivalent, comprising $495,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $705,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, for an amount \nequivalent  to  $600,000  and  by  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  for  an  amount \nequivalent  to  $350,000,  with  the  funding  administered  by  ADB,  covering  the  total  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $455,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  of \nBangladesh has agreed to finance the balance of $250,000 equivalent by providing counterpart ", "    5\nstaff, office facilities, local travel and vehicles, topographic surveys and hydraulic data collection, \ndata  analysis,  and  reports.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  is  in  Appendix  3.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months commencing in March 2006 and with an \nestimated completion date of April 2007. BWDB will nominate the project director and will \nprovide in-kind contributions to the TA consultants. A steering committee will be established, \nchaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, and with participation by representatives \nof the ministries of agriculture, communications, fisheries and livestock, environment and forest, \nfinance  and  planning,  land,  local  government,  rural  development  and  cooperatives,  and \nwomen\u2019s  affairs.  In  each  subproject  area,  a  JMC  will  be  established  consisting  of  district \nrepresentatives of line agencies and representatives of beneficiaries. The Government  will \nprovide  a  technical  support  team  consisting  of  six  experts  in  irrigation,  design,  social \ndevelopment, environment, water management, and economics.  \n \n20.  ADB  will  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  local  firm(s)  to \nconduct the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The consultants will be \nselected following the quality- and cost-based selection procedure with full technical proposal. \nThe TA consulting services under the Japan Special Fund financing require 13 person-months \nof international consulting services comprising two specialists, a water resources development \nspecialist (team leader) and an agricultural economist, and 46 person-months of nine domestic \nconsultants:  an  irrigation  engineer,  a  resettlement  specialist,  an  institutional  development \nspecialist, a financial management specialist, a natural resources economist, an agricultural \nextension specialist, a fisheries development specialist, a gender and development specialist, \nand  an  environmental  specialist.  The  TA  consulting  services  under  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation  Fund  financing  will  involve  three  consultants,  including  an  international  social \ndevelopment specialist, a domestic poverty reduction specialist, and a domestic participatory \ndevelopment specialist, to be recruited individually by ADB. The outline terms of reference are \nin Appendix 4. Equipment will be purchased by the TA consultants under the Japan Special \nFund financing following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n21.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month of TA commencement, \n(ii) an interim report within 4 months, (iii) a draft final report within 13 months, and (iv) a final \nreport on completion of the TA. National and regional workshops will be held during the interim \nreport and draft final report stages to reflect the views of stakeholders and experts in relation to \nthe TA\u2019s implementation and outputs.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, and (ii) ADB providing \nthe balance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the Government of \nBangladesh for preparing the Second Command Area Development Project, and hereby reports \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nthis action to the Board. \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Data \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting   Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nImpact     \nEnhance rural  Increased gross  Baseline survey data \nlivelihoods by improving  domestic product and  during the technical \nwater resources  established,  assistance \ninfrastructure  sustainable water   \n  management systems  Bangladesh Bureau of \n  in large flood control,  Statistics reports \ndraining, and irrigation   \nschemes by June 2013   Project completion \n  report \n  \n       \nOutcome      Assumptions \nFeasibility study and an  Memorandum of  Memorandum of  \u2022  National poverty reduction \ninvestment proposal  understanding signed  understanding  strategy is approved. \nagreed to by the  by the Government and  \u2022  Project will be completed \nGovernment and ADB   ADB during an  on schedule. \n   appraisal mission in  \u2022  All stakeholders are \n  November 2007  committed to the Project \n    and capable of \n    implementing it. \n   \n  Risk \n  \u2022  Project implementation \nmay be delayed beyond \nthe project period. \n       \nOutputs      Risks \nTechnical assessments  Draft final report  Consultants\u2019 inception,  \u2022  Government approval of \ncompleted  submitted to the  mid-term, and quarterly  project documents is \n  Government and ADB  reports  delayed. \nProject design  by November 2007    \u2022  Agreement on \nrequirements    development options is \naccomplished    delayed. \n   \n   \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.1 Submit inception report (by April 2006)  ADB: $600,000  \n1.2 Select project schemes (by August 2006)  PRF: $350,000  \n1.3 Conduct topographic survey for selected schemes (by July 2006)  Government: $250,000 \n1.4 Prepare feasibility studies (by September 2006)   \n1.5 Prepare draft final report (by November 2006) \n1.6 Prepare final report (by January 2007)   \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PRF = Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2          7 \n   \n \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.

No \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nBangladesh is overwhelmingly rural, densely populated, and extremely poor. Even though available poverty data \nindicate that poverty is declining, about 50% of the population lives below the official poverty line and Bangladesh is \none of the poorest countries in the world. The slow progress in income poverty reduction since the early 1980s stands \nout as the challenging feature of Bangladesh\u2019s development. Despite the increase in per capita income from 2.0% per \nyear in the 1980s and early 1990s to 3.8% over the last 3 years, this has not resulted in significant poverty reduction. \n \nEconomic development and poverty reduction are the country\u2019s overriding development priorities. The 2000 household \nexpenditure survey reveals that about 77% of the population and some 85% of the poor live in rural areas, that 42% of \nrural households are below the poverty line as measured in terms of caloric intake (2,212 kilocalories/day/person), and \nthat 19% of rural households are below the hardcore line (1,805 kilocalories/day/person).  \n \nFor the rural poor, access to and control of water resources is of fundamental importance, because water is the \nfoundation for many livelihood activities, including agricultural production, fisheries, and forestry. The national poverty \nreduction strategy addresses the development of rural infrastructure as a critical factor in increasing on- and off-farm \nemployment and income, especially for the rural poor and women. Additional key priorities are income-generation \nactivities and microfinance for employment opportunities in the on- and off-farm sectors. \n \nAs agriculture accounts for more than a quarter of gross domestic product and employs almost 60% of the labor force, \nit is important to sustain agricultural production and accelerate diversification and other livelihood improvements in \nrural areas. As Bangladesh gets too much water during the monsoon season and little water during the dry season, \nagricultural development has faced major bottlenecks in sustainable water management. Improving water resources \ninfrastructure  through  participatory  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  is  essential  for  meeting  the  agriculture \ndevelopment requirements, as emphasized in the Government\u2019s national water policy. As part of its targeted, pro-poor \ngrowth strategy, the national poverty reduction strategy has identified the key areas of intervention, which include \nalleviating flood and drainage congestion, salinity, erosion, and improving irrigation, which in relation to poverty \nreduction is particularly important for small farmers and wage laborers. Participatory water management could improve \nthe sustainability of agricultural production and integrated water management could accelerate crop diversification and \nincome-generating activities.  \n \nDeveloping efficient and sustainable flood management and irrigation systems is central to boosting agricultural \nproductivity and encouraging livelihood diversification. The management of water resources has adopted basic \nprinciples  of  integrated  management,  sustainable  service  delivery,  and  beneficiary  participation.  In  addition  to \nproviding assistance for efficient public investment in flood control, drainage, and irrigation schemes, the Project will \nsupport the Government\u2019s efforts to decentralize system design and management and foster sustainable O&M by \nencouraging  stakeholder  participation  and  empowerment,  integrating  service  delivery  with  other  development \nservices,  and  enhancing  opportunities  for  disadvantaged  groups  to  have  access  to  irrigation.  In  addition,  the \nrehabilitation of water resources infrastructure will help increase agricultural production and improve food security.  \n \nIn particular, the development of infrastructure for water resources plays a significant role in poverty reduction, both \ndirectly and indirectly. In direct terms, it provides immediate cash incomes and job opportunities: estimates indicate \nthat the cost of hiring local, unskilled labor accounts for about 20% of the total costs of water resources development \nprojects  and  such  projects  provide  substantial  employment  opportunities  to  farmers  and  rural  populations  in \ninfrastructure construction and O&M. Indirectly, improved infrastructure can reduce the cost of agricultural products, \nincrease prices paid to farmers for their products, and help the diffusion of agricultural technology.  \n \n ", " 8  Appendix 2   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                           Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPoverty Analysis. The most direct economic measure of poverty is based on income or expenditure. Such data are \ncommonly collected through sample surveys, such as household income and expenditure surveys. The small area \nestimation technique will provide ways to improve poverty estimates by combining limited survey data with more \ncomprehensive datasets that do not include income or expenditure data. Regression parameters are then applied to \nthe larger dataset to estimate income (or expenditure) for households, and the predicted income data permit \nestimating poverty at the district level. Previously, the incidence of core poor as measured by the headcount index and \nbased on direct caloric intake has shown an annual growth rate of 1.5% in the areas designated for the water \nresources infrastructure development project.  \n \nPoverty Mapping. Poverty maps will provide a geographic picture of poverty in the districts where large schemes are \nlocated. The poverty maps will combine survey and census data to generate poverty and inequality profiles at low \nlevels of aggregation. The maps will be useful for generating an overview and for undertaking or confirming general \ntargeting for selected project schemes.  \n \nDistribution Analysis. To improve the impact of poverty reduction efforts, distribution analysis of project benefits will \nassess the equity of project effects and show how the Project\u2019s cost and benefits will be shared among the poor and \nother stakeholders.
