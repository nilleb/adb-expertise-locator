During the 2004 Country Programming Mission, the Government requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Northern Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Transport Network Project. A project preparation technical assistance (PPTA) \nfor this project was included in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) (2005)1 and Regional Cooperation Strategy and \nProgram Update (2006\u20132008): Greater Mekong Subregion (2005). Under an ADB-funded small-\nscale TA2 a study was undertaken to identify priority connections to, and across, the northern \nregion of Lao PDR from the countries of the northern GMS. The PPTA will prepare a project for \nthe  top-ranked  connection  identified  under  the  small-scale  TA.  This  project,  which  will  be \nsuitable for funding by ADB, shall be technically and economically feasible and socially and \nenvironmentally acceptable. A mission visited the Lao PDR from 22 August to 2 September \n2005 and held initial discussions with the Government on the proposed TA. Agreements were \nreached  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference. A design and monitoring framework for the PPTA is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Landlocked Lao PDR is poor, mountainous, and sparsely populated. Road access is a \nkey condition that underlies the potential for poverty reduction in the Lao PDR, both in terms of \nability and cost effectiveness of targeting services to the poor, as well as the benefits in poverty \nreduction that result from economic growth. Thus, improved accessibility can reduce poverty \nboth directly and indirectly, with multisectoral implications, especially in education and health. \n \n3.  The Government has set as its long-term development goal the exiting from the status of \na  least  developed  country  by  2020  through  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication \nStrategy.3 It identifies transport development as critical to achieving the overall development \ngoal.  The main  goal  for  transport  is  to  \u201cfully  integrate  the  economy,  thereby  providing  an \nenabling environment for trade and commerce and access for all Lao people to basic services\u201d. \nThe strategy\u2019s specific transport goals include improving access to markets, and strengthening \neconomic development, transport links with neighboring countries, and regional integration and \ntrade opportunities. The Government has given high priority to improving the road transport \nsystem to facilitate (i) the movement of agricultural products from surplus to deficit areas, (ii) the \nflow of consumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, (iii) marketing and export of cash \ncrops and other produce, and (iv) participation in regional and international trade. The targets \nfor physical infrastructure development include (i) completing the national road network, (ii) \nimproving the provincial road network, (iii) upgrading transit routes, and (iv) establishing a \nsustainable maintenance system to preserve the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. \n \n4.  Transport is almost exclusively by road. Roads carry about 70% of freight and 90% of \npassenger traffic, and are a key element of the basic infrastructure supporting national and \ninternational trade. Density of the road network is low: about 0.14 kilometer per square kilometer. \nRoad  contact  between  Vientiane and  the  provincial  capitals is  improving,  but 4  of  the  18 \nprovincial capitals remain without all-weather links. Only 14% of the road network is paved, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 12 September 2005. \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for GMS Infrastructure Connections in \nNorthern Lao PDR. Manila (TA 6193) \n3  The National Assembly of the Lao PDR mandated the Government to implement the strategy in October 2003. \n ", "2   \nincluding about half of the national road system. The other roads have gravel or earth surfaces. \nMuch of the local network is impassable during the wet season. Traffic is generally low on \nnational and provincial roads. \n \n5.  The  Lao  PDR  is  pivotal  to  the  GMS  transport  corridors  linking  northern  Thailand, \nnorthern Viet Nam, and the southern provinces of the People\u2019s Republic of China. A major \nimpediment  to  subregional  economic  cooperation  is  poor  basic  infrastructure.  Improved \nconnections are required across countries and between centers of economic activity. In northern \nGMS,  sections  of  key  transport  corridors  have  been  improved  under  other  projects  but \nsignificant gaps remain. Themes developed under the Northern Region Development Strategy4 \ninclude  connecting  provincial  centers  within  northern  Lao  PDR  and  improving  connections \nbetween the Lao PDR and GMS countries. Improving routes that connect provinces in the Lao \nPDR  will  enhance  subregional  connections  between  northern  Lao  PDR  and  surrounding \ncountries. \n \n6.  A number of border crossings have been established between the Lao PDR and its GMS \nneighbors. Upgrading of roads in the neighboring countries to these existing crossings is either \ncomplete or under way. However, within Lao PDR many of the linkages across the country \nbetween these border crossings are either absent or in poor condition. Although other crossings \nmay be established, a significant program of investments is needed to connect the existing \ncrossings.  \n \n7.  Under TA 6193 (footnote 2) corridors across northern Lao PDR were identified that \nlinked existing border crossings. This allowed the upgrading of sections of roads along these \ncorridors to be placed in both national and subregional contexts. The corridors were ranked \nusing  economic  analysis  and  multi-criteria  analysis  (MCA).  MCA  allowed  factors  such  as \naccessibility to markets, need for health and education facilities, and agricultural potential to be \nincluded in the assessment. Under the economic analysis, the basis for ranking each road \nsegment was the net present value of cost and benefit streams arising from improvements to \neach segment. This analysis gave the highest priority to upgrading three segments of Route 4, \nstarting from the junction with Route 13, near Luangprabang, to the border with Thailand near \nKenthao. The same result came out of evaluations using MCA, and a combination of economic \nanalysis and MCA.  \n \n8.  The upgrading of Route 4 will connect (i) districts in central and southern Xayabury, (ii) \nthe capitals of Luangprabang and Xayabury with a sealed all-weather road, and (iii) the border \ncrossing with Thailand near Kenthao5 with the GMS corridors that converge on Luangprabang. \nThese connections will reduce transport costs to deliver produce from the important agricultural \nareas in southern Xayabury to domestic and subregional markets. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  The strategy is to be incorporated into the Lao PDR national socioeconomic development plan for 2006\u20132010. \n5  In 2004, construction of a bridge and connecting roads on the Lao and Thai sides of the border were completed \nusing funds from the Government of Thailand. \n ", "  3\n9.  Ongoing  transport  policy  initiatives  address  the  following:  (i)  sustainability  of  the \ntransport network, (ii) reduction of road traffic accidents, and (iii) improvement of the capacity of \nroad sector agencies to manage social and environmental impacts. Under the ADB-funded \nRural Access Roads Project6 and Roads for Rural Development Project (RRDP),7 and the World \nBank-funded  Road  Maintenance,  Projects  I  and  II,  support  is  being  given  to  the  Road \nMaintenance Fund (RMF). The target is that 90% of funding for the national road network will be \nsourced from domestic funds by 2014. The World Bank program is helping the RMF develop \nsystems to prepare strategic and annual maintenance plans and to implement these plans. As \npart of the RRDP, the Nordic Development Fund is funding a component to implement the \nNational Road Safety Strategy. Work on this component will start in December 2005. Under an \nADB-funded TA,8 a program was prepared to build the Department of Roads\u2019 capacity. The \nSwedish International Development Agency (Sida) is preparing a proposal to extend Sida-\nfunded work and build on the work under the above TA. \n \n10.  The  Government  has  requested  its  development  partners  in  the  road  subsector  to \nconsider adopting a sector-wide approach (SWAp). Support to the RMF has the characteristics \nof a SWAp in that the development partners are providing funds that the RMF allocates to a \nprogram of priority road maintenance projects. The identification and prioritization of the projects \nis based on agreed procedures. To prepare for a SWAp for the road subsector will require \nconfirmation that Ministry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction (MCTPC) has \nthe capacity to implement a SWAp, that all necessary procedures are developed, and that \nindicators and targets are identified.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The target outcome of the proposed project, and the impact of this PPTA, is to make the \nmovement  of  passengers  and  goods  more  efficient  and  cost-effective  provincially  (within \nXayabury), nationally (between northern and central Lao PDR), and subregionally (between \nnorthern Lao PDR and Thailand). The PPTA\u2019s output will be a project design and feasibility \nstudy agreed upon by ADB and the Government. The study will set out an economically and \ntechnically  feasible  and  socially  and  environmentally  acceptable  project  to  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade transport links and facilities along the project roads. An initial poverty and social \nanalysis for the project is in Appendix 2. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  PPTA activities will address the requirements of ADB and the Government to prepare a \nproject suitable for funding under an ADB loan. The PPTA scope will cover the entire length of \nRoute 4, from the junction with Route 13 at Xieng Ngeun, near Luangprabang, to Ban Nakha, \nincluding connections to the border with Thailand near Kenthao. The PPTA will also include the \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

Considerations for project sustainability will include a review of \nthe RMF\u2019s activities, and an analysis of projections for RMF revenues and expenses required to \nmaintain the national road network. The project will include a crossing of the Mekong River at \nPakkhorn-Thadeu,  which  is  currently  served  by  a  ferry.  Under  the  PPTA,  a  preliminary \nevaluation will be undertaken of the relative merits of either upgrading the existing ferry facilities \nor constructing a bridge. This study will include an assessment of potential environmental and \nsocial impacts. \n \n13.  The PPTA will review MCTPC\u2018s capacity to implement a SWAp. Procedures will be \nreviewed to ensure that an appropriate program of investment projects can be developed and \nmonitored, and appropriate indicators and targets will be identified. The PPTA will include a \nworkshop for MCTPC and the development partners to discuss this review. If it is agreed that \nthe conditions for a SWAp can be met then a program will be proposed to launch the SWAp. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $480,000 and the local currency cost is $470,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$800,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local \ncurrency cost amounting to $320,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of the Lao PDR \nwill  finance  the  remaining  $150,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs  through  in-kind \ncontributions of the Executing Agency in terms of counterpart staff; office furniture, and facilities \nfor  the  consultants  and  counterpart  staff;  local  transport  and  local  communications  for \ncounterpart staff; and maps, reports, and other information. Detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 3. The Government of the Lao PDR has been informed that approval of the TA does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MCTPC will be the Executing Agency for the PPTA, with overall responsibility for the \nGovernment\u2019s contribution. The director general of the Department of Roads (DOR), under \nMCTPC, will have technical responsibility for the PPTA, and will set up a subunit staffed with \ncounterpart  personnel  for  day-to-day  coordination  and  to  work  with  the  PPTA  consultant\u2019s \npersonnel as well as other Government agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \nother interested parties. \n \n16.  The TA will require about 79 person-months of consulting services, including about 21 \nperson-months of international and about 58 person-months of domestic consulting services. \nThe TA will be implemented over 8 months, from May 2006. The TA will close at the end of April \n                                                 \n9  The entire length of Route 4A was included in the scope of the RRDP (footnote 7) but upgrading work cannot be \ncompleted due to a shortage of funds.  \n ", "  5\n2007, allowing for submission of final reports and accounts.

Reports will be prepared and submitted as follows:  \n(i)  an inception report, 1 month after services start; \n(ii)  an interim report, at the end of the third month of the services;  \n(iii)  a draft final report, at the end of the seventh month, presenting all aspects of the \nstudy results, including surveys, findings, and recommendations; and \n(iv)  a final report, 1 month after receiving comments on the draft final report from \nMCTPC and ADB. \n \n18.  Brief progress reports will be submitted monthly. Tripartite meetings will be held after the \nsubmission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. A workshop will be held after \nsubmission of the draft final report to present the project to the Government, NGOs, and other \nstakeholders.  A  second  workshop,  to  be  attended  by  representatives  of  all  development \npartners, will be held to present the results of the sector development component.  \n \n19.  The international consultants will have expertise in transport planning and economics, \nhighway  design  and  maintenance,  bridge  maintenance,  environmental  assessment, \nresettlement,  social  development  issues,  and  institutional  development.  The  domestic \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  transport  planning,  highway  design,  environmental \nassessment, resettlement, and social development. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Consultants will be recruited using quality- \nand cost-based selection procedures; simplified technical proposals will be requested. TA-\nfinanced equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nEquipment purchased under the PPTA will be handed over to the DOR at the end of the \nservices. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for preparing the Northern Greater \nMekong Subregion Transport Network Improvement Project, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms  \nImpact  Upgrading of Route 4 to a  Provincial and  Assumptions \nFacilitate more efficient and cost- sealed, all-weather, standard  national trade  \u2022  The GMS Agreement \neffective movement of passengers  road.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao PDR: \nThe poor in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (the Lao PDR) are heavily burdened by lack of access \nto goods, labor markets, and social services. Lack of access results in high transportation costs that \nreduce the mobility of people and of goods produced by the poor. It also results in reduced or lack of \naccess to consumer goods, social services, information, and market and livelihood opportunities for labor, \nwith consequent implications for income and socioeconomic welfare. Poor households in areas with limited \naccess are often unable to overcome the cost barriers of mobility. This results in high levels of \nsubsistence, with high vulnerability to external shocks and food shortages. \n \nPoor rural access to the rest of the economy implies that overall economic growth has limited impact on \nthe rural poor. The result is increased inequalities between rural and urban areas. The Lao PDR greatly \nreduced poverty during the 1990s, mainly because of economic growth, but significantly less so in remote \nand access-deprived provinces; poverty even increased in some areas.  \n \nThe road sector plays a key role in improving accessibility in landlocked Lao PDR. Mobility of people, \ngoods, and services will increase and affect prices. How much mobility increases, however, will largely \ndepend on policies of transport services, including outreach and tariffs, and the demand and affordability \nof such services.   \n \nRoad accessibility will inevitably improve access to social services, including health and education, by \nshortening the time and cost of traveling. The provision of services will also become more cost-effective. \nThe extent of these impacts, however, will depend on Government policies and the ability of the \nGovernment to provide these services. Data suggest that all-weather village accessibility determines \noverall village welfare and poverty. Nationwide, per capita expenditures were found to be 46% higher for \nvillages with all-weather access than those with no access, and 21% higher than in villages that have only \ndry-season access.    \n \nRoad access is key to reducing poverty, both in terms of capability and cost-effectiveness of targeting \nservices to the poor, and in the benefits of economic growth. Most of the poor live in rural areas with \nlimited road access. Improved access will remove cost barriers to providing social services and enhance \nthe ability of the poor to benefit from overall economic growth. Thus, the impacts of improved accessibility \non poverty reduction can be direct and indirect, with multisectoral implications, especially with respect to \neducation and health.   \n \nIncreased road access integrates the project areas into the larger economy. Integration promotes overall \neconomic growth by allowing these areas to contribute to the economy, and vice versa. Integration also \nenables the population to better benefit from economic growth. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPoverty and social issues in the project area will be evaluated based on ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social \nAnalysis (2001). This evaluation will describe poverty incidence in the project area, and assesses the causes of \npoverty and the extent to which the proposed project will address them. A poverty analysis will focus on the impact of \nthe recommended road improvements on the provision of social services, on movement of goods and people, and on \npoverty. The economic analysis of the project will include a distributional analysis between stakeholders, including the \npoor. A poverty impact ratio will be calculated for the project. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  To be prepared under the proposed TA. \n \nA participatory stakeholders\u2019 analysis will be an integral part of social and gender analysis, and of a resettlement plan \nand an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP). Participatory appraisal with various stakeholders will be undertaken \nas part of social assessment. Individual and groups consultations will be conducted at the household and village levels \nduring the preparation of a resettlement plan and EMDP.  The stakeholder analysis will include assessments of \npotential impacts of human trafficking and HIV/AIDS.1\n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No  To be prepared under the proposed TA. \n \nThe participatory strategy will include a grassroots mechanism for public information disclosure of compensation and \nresettlement issues and grievance procedures for the affected people, by ethnic group and gender. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe socioeconomic data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnic minority group.  Data on resettlement issues will \nbe disaggregated by gender. A gender strategy will be prepared for ethnic minority groups and households affected by \nresettlement. A socioeconomic assessment will examine the extent to which the movement of goods, specifically \nagricultural products for the markets, will have an impact on women\u2019s work on agriculture and income, women\u2019s job \nand income-earning opportunities, and poor women\u2019s wage employment.  Information will be collected on rural \nhouseholds\u2019 access to social services and the likely impact of the improved provincial transport network on such \naccess. Capacity-building training needs of the local, district, and provincial women\u2019s union will be identified so that \nthey can participate in planning and implementing resettlement plans and EMDPs and in conducting community \ncampaigns against trafficking and for HIV/AIDS prevention. Gender-disaggregated monitoring indicators will be \ndeveloped to assess the impact on men and women from the affected households during preparation of resettlement \nplans and the EMDP. \n \nThe project\u2019s construction phase will bring an influx of temporary laborers, with impacts on communities, including \nincreased demand for commercial sex workers, the introduction of new ideas, and job and business opportunities. \nBetter roads facilitate movement from communities that offer few job or livelihood options. This can be positive if \nmigration is safe, but such migration often ends in exploitation in the hands of human traffickers. The worst form of \ntrafficking in the region is of women and children for commercial sex and child labor. The low status of women \nincreases their vulnerability as targets and limits their options as survivors seeking a new life. Efforts to increase \nawareness of the dangers of trafficking, and provision of safe migration services, will help prevent negative outcomes \nfrom increased mobility in areas with improved roads.  Formal employment builds the status and confidence of young \nwomen, who can then better resist the coercion and deception of traffickers. The increased risk of HIV/AIDS will be \nmitigated through an awareness and prevention program. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?
