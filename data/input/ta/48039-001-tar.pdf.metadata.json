INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  is  committed  to  increasing  economic  growth  and \nimproving the delivery of public services to people in the regions. The Government\u2019s Housing for \nIntegrated Rural Development (HIRD) investment program is a key pillar of the government\u2019s \nefforts to meet these objectives. The government has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nassistance to support its efforts in improving the welfare of people in rural areas, particularly \nthrough its flagship HIRD program. The technical assistance (TA) was discussed with the \ngovernment and confirmed in a memorandum of understanding signed in October 2014.1 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Economic growth in Uzbekistan has been robust in recent years. Since 2009 it has \nremained above 8% per year, and it is expected to stay above 7% in 2014 and 2015.2 Rural \nareas are typified by an uneven level of economic development, low industrialization, and high \nlevels of inequity in education and income distribution.3 About 16% of people in Uzbekistan live \nbelow the poverty line, 75% of whom live in rural areas.4 \n3.  Under the government\u2019s Welfare Improvement Strategy, 2013\u20132015, a key objective is \nhigher rates of economic development in regions that have lower per capita income, industrial \nproduction,  and  services,  especially  those  lagging  behind  Tashkent  City.  The  government \nobjective is to ensure that living conditions for the rural population are brought as close as \npossible to the level enjoyed in cities. This is to be achieved through the development of \ntransport  and  public  utilities  infrastructure,  educational  institutions,  health  care  units,  and \nsporting facilities. \n4.  Prior to 2012, the government made a number of policy changes and implemented \nvarious programs to improve the regional economic performance. From 2007 to 2011, it initiated \nmany stimulus measures to expand mortgage loans and housing construction, particularly in \nrural areas. Two tax benefits included a deduction from taxable income for amounts paid on \nmortgage loans for young families with mortgage loans living in rural areas, and a 5-year \nexemption from all taxes for any newly established organizations constructing or renovating \nhouses. \n5.  The major program launched to support rural housing is the HIRD investment program. \nAs originally envisaged, 40,800 rural houses would be built nationwide from 2011 to 2015. The \ngovernment supports this program on a number of levels, including giving tax concessions to \nbuilding  contractors,  construction  materials  factories,  and  homebuyers,  offering  lower-than-\nmarket interest rates on mortgage loans, and providing to homebuyers free housing plots with \nutility  connections  developed  from  land  reserves  by  local  governments.  To  help  meet  the \ngovernment\u2019s other objectives in rural areas, health workers, teachers, and entrepreneurs were \ntargeted as rural homebuyers. In 2011, ADB approved a $500 million multitranche financing \nfacility to support HIRD through intermediary financing to the participating commercial banks \nthat provide mortgage loans to homebuyers.5  \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 December 2014. \n2  ADB. 2014.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Housing for Integrated Rural Development Investment \nProgram. Manila. \n ", "2   \n6.  The government is keen to build on the work to date and provide additional support for \nthe rural housing sector. This includes providing community services and improving (i) the \nenergy  efficiency  of  housing  projects  constructed  under  HIRD,  (ii)  housing  construction \nstandards and quality controls, and (iii) the business environment for rural micro and small \nbusinesses. The government also wants to increase the quality of public utility services and \nensure that critical pieces of infrastructure, such as natural gas, electricity, drinking water, and \nroads, are available when needed (footnote 5). \n \n7.  As  the  rural  housing  market  grows,  homebuyers  are  becoming  more  discerning, \ndemanding more robust construction standards, and expecting swift action to be taken against \nunderperforming construction firms. The government has introduced new processes: (i) greater \ntransparency  in  procurement;  (ii)  oversight  by  local  governments,  community  groups,  and \nregulatory agencies; (iii) a formalized complaints process; and (iv) feedback mechanisms for \ncomplaints to ensure that construction of houses under HIRD occurs in a timely manner and \ncomplies with the laws of Uzbekistan and ADB\u2019s policies. \n \n8.  Challenges  to  the  introduction  of  these  processes  included  coordination  of  central \ngovernment, local government, and community groups; familiarization of construction firms with \nHIRD\u2019s tender process; ensuring consistency in the evaluation of tenders; and quick correction \nof  errors  to  minimize  delays.  Construction  quality  performance  varies  significantly  across \nregions,  both  in  terms  of  the  construction  inspection  process  and  in  the  performance  of \ncontractors. The speed and volume of houses built exceeds the government\u2019s ability to oversee \nconstruction activities, and training for officials is needed. Limitations in construction oversight \ninclude a lack of understanding regarding the technology solutions available, few incentives to \nuse innovative techniques and technology, and limited capacity to integrate technology into \nexisting  oversight  methods.  The  government  is  also  interested  in  improving  the  energy \nefficiency and cost-effectiveness of HIRD houses. \n \n9.  A technical and financial performance review (TFPR) for HIRD houses built from 2009 to \n2011, prior to the commencement of ADB support for HIRD, is currently ongoing. In February \n2015, a technical and financial performance audit (TPFA) began for HIRD houses built  in 2012\u2013\n2013, i.e., with ADB support. The TFPR and TFPA will review construction quality but will not \nfocus  on  regulatory  issues.  The  proposed  TA  will  build  on  the  conclusions  and \nrecommendations of the TFPR and TFPA and support the development of recommendations for \nregulatory changes and capacity development improvements. The TA will assist the government \nin  implementing  the  recommendations,  including  building  capacity  in  relevant  government \nagencies. \n  \n10.  The key development issues to be addressed under the TA include: \n(i)  clarification  of  government  roles  and  responsibilities  in  housing  construction \noversight; \n(ii)  improved construction of HIRD houses and related infrastructure; \n(iii)  strengthened government oversight of rural housing construction; \n(iv)  strengthened procurement processes within HIRD; \n(v)  improved application of technology in rural housing construction; and \n(vi)  strengthened government support to small, home-based private businesses. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  will  be  improved  housing  construction,  associated  infrastructure,  and \nindividual work opportunities. The outcome will be improved government technical capacity to \ndeliver rural housing and associated infrastructure, and to support home-based enterprises. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have the following outputs: \n(i)  Output  1:  Improved  field  technical  assessment  tools  and  procurement  of \nHousing for Integrated Rural Development program construction. The TA will \n(a)  review  HIRD  designs,  procurement  processes,  construction  techniques, \nregulatory  standards,  and  regulatory  oversight  processes  with  government \nagencies,  construction  firms,  and  other  relevant  stakeholders;  (b)  assess \nconstruction and procurement processes undertaken to date in all provinces (this \nassessment  will  be  undertaken  annually),  construction  techniques,  regulatory \noversight mechanisms, documentation  at  local  levels,  and  any  other  issues  as \nrequired; and (c) design and deliver training to government agencies based on \nfindings (to be delivered annually). \n(ii)  Output 2: Improved field technical assessment tools of Housing for Integrated \nRural Development program infrastructure and community facilities. The TA \nwill  (a)  review  the  HIRD  program  infrastructure  and  community  facilities  with \ngovernment agencies and other relevant stakeholders; (b) assess infrastructure and \ncommunity facilities in all provinces and determine their appropriateness, relevance, \nand accessibility to homebuyers and massifs (residential housing sites); (c) assess \nfield  findings  against  government  programs  and  objectives  to  determine  the \nprogress and effectiveness of government initiatives; and (d) design and deliver \ntraining to stakeholders and government agencies based on the findings. \n(iii)  Output 3: Improved field technical assessment tools of program housing in \nsupport  of  home-based  enterprises.  The  TA  will  (a)  review  documentation \nassociated with government efforts to increase home-based enterprises related to \nthe  HIRD  program,  (b)  consult  with  government  agencies  and  other  relevant \nstakeholders in the HIRD program in relation to home-based enterprises, (c) assess \nhome-based  enterprises  in  all  provinces  to  determine  the  progress  and \neffectiveness  of  government  initiatives,  and  (d)  design  and  deliver  training  to \nstakeholders and government agencies based on the findings. \n \n13.  Major assumptions in the development of the TA are that (i) the government continues \nthe HIRD program beyond 2015; (ii) the government reviews and changes necessary technical \nassessment processes and related resources in a timely manner for rural housing; and (iii) \naccess by consultants to houses, contractors, and other key stakeholders is fully provided in a \ntimely manner.6 Major risks to the success of the TA are insufficient government financing for \nthe  required  changes,  government  resistance  to  using  new  methods  and  technology,  and \ndifficulty in accessing new technology in rural areas. \n \n                                                \n6  On 27 August 2014, the Islamic Development Bank approved a loan providing $100 million in support for HIRD in \n2015. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, logistics support, office accommodation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months from July 2015 to December 2017. The \nproposed executing agency is the Ministry of Economy. The proposed implementing agency is \nthe State Committee for Architecture and Construction.  The Public Management, Financial \nSector, and Trade Division and the Uzbekistan Resident Mission, both within the Central and \nWest Asia Department, will manage the TA. \n \n16.  The TA will provide a total of 49 person-months of consulting services, which will be \nsupplied through a firm (20 person-months) and the procurement of three individual consultants \n(29 person-months). The firm will provide four international experts\u2014a civil engineer (team \nleader), a procurement specialist, a community services specialist, and a small businesses \nspecialist. The three individual consultants will be a civil engineer (international), a civil engineer \n(national), and a procurement specialist (national).7 The national specialists will support the firm. \nHowever, the firm will be responsible for all TA outputs delivered after the firm is deployed. The \ndetailed list of consultants and summary terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The firm will be \nselected  in  accordance  with  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  using  simplified  technical \nproposals  and  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  The  selection  of  the  firm  and  the  individual \nconsultants will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The  consultants  will  maintain  close  working  relationships  with  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies and will regularly discuss project progress and findings. Consultants will \nprovide  both  inception  reports  and  deliverables  consistent  with  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework activities, outputs, and delivery dates. All deliverables will be linked to the design and \nmonitoring framework. All consultant reports will be prepared and provided in English and \ntranslated into Russian and/or Uzbek for the government\u2019s ease of reference. \n \n18.  The TA will follow monitoring and supervision procedures for ADB-administered TA \nprojects. Field reviews will take place at least semiannually, and the TA will be discussed during \nreview missions for related loan projects. The outputs of the TA will be used for policy dialogue,  \ndisseminated  through  various  workshops  and  government  websites,  and  incorporated  into \nfuture government programs. An evaluation of performance and outcomes will be carried out at \nthe end of the TA and reflected in a TA completion report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for Enhancing Efficiency in Rural Infrastructure, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  The civil engineer (international) will be hired as soon as possible after TA approval in order to provide necessary \nsupport during the construction of HIRD houses in 2015 and to prepare the groundwork for the consultants of the \nfirm, which will be selected in late 2015.  \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved housing  Complaints related to  HIRD program  Government continues \nconstruction,  HIRD program and  implementation unit  the HIRD program \nassociated  associated infrastructure  annual statistics  beyond 2015. \ninfrastructure, and  reduced by 10%   \nindividual work  (baseline: 245 complaints  Risk \nopportunities  in 2012) by 2020  Insufficient government \nfinancing for the \nNumber of jobs created    required changes. \nby home-based \nenterprises increased by \n10% (baseline: 220,000 in \n2012) by 2020 \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved  Infrastructure inspection  Government resolutions  Government reviews \ngovernment technical  processes are enhanced  of new inspection  and changes \ncapacity to deliver  by the expansion and  processes  necessary technical \nrural housing and  modernization of new  assessment processes \nConsultant\u2019s reports \nassociated  inspection and  and related resources \ninfrastructure, and to  participatory processes by  in a timely manner for \nsupport home-based  2017 (baseline: 0  rural housing. \nenterprises  homeowners involved in   \ninfrastructure process in  Risk \n2012).
