INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Independent Evaluation Department (IED)1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ndevelops  its  3-year  evaluation  program  in  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors \nDevelopment  Effectiveness  Committee,  Management,  and  operations  departments.  The \nproposed research and development technical assistance (TA) will be used to finance the \nfollowing activities in IED's 2010 work program:2 (i) updating the evaluation findings on Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) VIII and ADF IX, and assessing the implementation progress of ADF \nX; (ii) assessing the post-project completion sustainability of ADB-funded projects in a number \nof critical sectors; (iii) evaluating the impact of ADB support to commercialization of agriculture \nand agri-business projects on inclusive growth and poverty reduction; (iv) validating regional \ncooperation partnership strategy and country partnership strategy final reviews; (v) undertaking \nsector and thematic evaluations; and (vi) disseminating evaluation knowledge products. Such \nmulticountry and multisector evaluation activities\u2014which are  geared to improve development \neffectiveness in developing member countries (DMCs)\u2014have benefited from the use of ADB TA \nresources, which are more responsive in providing the needed inputs. This is first of the two TAs \nplanned for 2010.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB  Strategy  2020's4  results  framework  and  its  annual  review5  have  brought \ndevelopment effectiveness to the core of ADB operations. This TA helps IED provide evaluative \nfeedback  on  ADB's  operational  effectiveness  in  three  important  areas:  (i)  the  use  of \nconcessional ADF resources; (ii) post-completion sustainability of ADB-funded projects in a \nnumber of sectors and regions; and (iii) the effectiveness of assistance for commercializing the \nagriculture sector, which is an important activity to achieve inclusive development by creating \nproductive employment in rural areas, where poverty in most ADB DMCs is concentrated.  \n \nA.  Evaluation of Asian Development Fund Operations \n \n3.  IED has evaluated ADF operations three times. The first evaluation6 covered operations \nfrom ADF I to ADF V. The second evaluation7 covered operations during the ADF VI and ADF \nVII periods, and the third8 (carried out in 2007), covered the ADF VIII and IX periods. The third \nreview was a real-time evaluation of ongoing operations based on a desk review of portfolio \nperformance, and was based on limited data: only 22 out of 245 projects funded by ADF VIII \nand ADF IX were complete, and of these just eight had been self-evaluated by the regional \ndepartments in their project completion reports (PCRs). IED had done no project performance \nevaluation  reports  (PPERs)  for  projects  funded  by  ADF  VIII  at  the  time  of  the  third  ADF \n                                                 \n1  IED was named the Operations Evaluation Department, or OED, until December 2008. \n2  The Board approved IED's 2010\u20132012 work program in December 2009. The 2010 work program includes 41 \nevaluation studies and 40 project and program completion report validations. Subsequent to the approval of the \nprogram, IED included evaluations of ADF operations and the ADB Institute in its 2010 work program in response \nto requests from ADB Strategy and Planning Department and Development Effectiveness Committee.  The IED \nWork Program is available at http://www.adb.org/evaluation/about/workprograms.asp \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 May 2010.  \n4  ADB. 2008.

It is expected that a large number of the projects financed by ADF VIII and several \nADF IX projects will be complete by early 2010, thereby providing the operational data needed \nto make a firmer assessment of development effectiveness. The proposed evaluation is the \nfourth to assess the development effectiveness of ADF-funded operations. The evaluation will \nhelp (i) improve selection, preparation, and implementation of future ADF-funded projects to \nenhance their development impact; and (ii) inform preparation of ADF XI. \n \n4.  ADB's Strategy 2020 mandates that ADF operations contribute to: (i) growth with equity; \n(ii) environmental sustainability of development; and (iii) promotion of national public goods in \ncombination  with  cross-border,  sub-regional,  and  global  public  goods.  Using  this  strategic \nframework as a backdrop, the evaluation will seek to answer the following key questions:  \n(i)  Has ADB fulfilled its obligations and the commitments made during the ADF VIII, \nIX and X replenishment discussions?  \n(ii)  Has  ADB  reoriented  its  overall  strategy  and  operational  priorities  to  support \npoverty  reduction,  while  continuing  efforts  to  stimulate  broad-based  and \nsustainable economic growth?  \n(iii)  To  what  extent  has  debt  sustainability  been  taken  into  account  in  ADF \noperations, and how effective has the ADF grant mechanism been compared to \nADF  lending  and  ordinary  capital  resources  loans  in  delivering  development \nresults?  \nB.  Post-Completion Sustainability of ADB-Funded Projects \n \n5.   Post-evaluation reports rate approximately a third of ADB projects \u201cnot likely to be \nsustainable\u201d. According to IED guidelines, a project could be considered sustainable if the \nhuman,  institutional,  financial  and  natural  resources  are  likely  to  be  sufficient,  with  high \nprobability, to maintain the project outcomes over its economic lifetime; and any imminent risks \nto project sustainability could be managed. Project sustainability is influenced by a number of \nfactors. They include: (i) economic factors encompassing market demand and efficiency of \ninvestments; (ii) project management, project financing, and cost recovery; (iii) project design \nand its technical efficiency; (iv) use of resources and impact on the environment; (v) legal and \nregulatory environment; (vi) institutional development and managerial capacity; and (vii) the \ngovernment's political commitment to the project and the associated policy and institutional \narrangements, including reforms. The importance of these factors and the extent and intensity \nof their impact on project sustainability vary across sectors and regions. Assessing the risks and \npotential impacts of these factors on project sustainability, in a particular sector at a particular \nplace and time, is an important task at project appraisal. \n \n6.  ADB's post-project and post-program evaluation guidelines require a careful assessment \nof sustainability during a project or program\u2019s economic lifetime.9 The following questions are \ncritical to sustainability:  \n(i)  Would the benefits from ADB-funded projects continue after project completion \nand cessation of ADB funding?  \n(ii)  What determines the sustainability of ADB-funded projects?  \n(iii)  What is required to mitigate the risks to sustainability identified at appraisal? \nWould the mitigation measures themselves be feasible and sustainable?  \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

Effectiveness of Support to Agribusiness to Promote Value Chains for Inclusive \nDevelopment. \n \n7.  In spite of the considerable progress in poverty alleviation in Asia, rural poverty remains \nhigh, and over three quarters of the Asian poor reside in rural areas. Improving the productivity \nof agriculture sector is critical for providing sustainable employment to the rural poor to alleviate \npoverty. Rapid economic progress and urbanization provides growth opportunities for higher \nvalue-added,  labor  intensive  farm-based  activities  in  agro-processing,  dairy  products, \nhorticulture, and livestock products. This requires investments in rural infrastructure to provide \naccess to water, transport, and storage facilities, as well as areas in which the private sector \ncould play an important role, such as agricultural extension services, agro-processing, and farm \nlogistics. A conducive legal, policy, and institutional environment to commercialize farm activities \nwill stimulate private enterprise and investment. The study will evaluate: (i)  comprehensiveness \nof  support  for  commercial  agriculture  and  agribusiness  to  promote  socially  inclusive  and \nsustainable economic development, (ii) policy and institutional framework for respective roles of \npublic vis-a-vis private sector in agribusiness development, and (iii) extent of integration of \nsmallholder producers and micro-enterprises with value chain market including supermarkets. \nThe study will assess the inclusiveness of value chain development and the benefits accrued to \npoorer farmers, women and marginal groups.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA is improved development effectiveness of ADB operations and \npolicies  through  learning  from  evaluation  findings.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  is  improved  (i) \nformulation and implementation of country and sector strategies, and ADB policies; and (ii) \ndesigns  of  projects  and  programs  based  on  IED  evaluation  findings,  lessons,  and \nrecommendations.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will support special evaluation studies (SESs) to assess: (i) ADF operations, (ii) \nthe sustainability of ADB projects and programs, and (iii) the effectiveness of ADB assistance \nfor agro-business and commercialization of agriculture. The TA will also provide support to (i) \nvalidation of regional cooperation partnership strategy and country partnership strategy final \nreviews; (ii) sector and thematic evaluations; and (ii) dissemination of evaluation knowledge \nproducts. The scope, methodology, resource requirements, consultants' terms of reference, and \nknowledge  dissemination  plan  of  each  of  the  evaluations  are  outlined  in  their  respective \nevaluation approach papers.  \n \n ", "4 \n10.   Special evaluation study of the Asian Development Fund operations. The SES will \nevaluate ADF-funded projects, and related business processes and policies.10 To address the \nissues and questions raised in paras. 3 and 4 (above), the SES will rely on the following \napproach and activities: (i) analyze the ADF portfolio in detail to (a) study the composition of \nADF allocations, and (b) assess the support for regional cooperation and integration, poverty \nalleviation, Millennium Development Goals, and climate change; (ii) do meta-evaluation and \nsynthesis of key findings regarding the development effectiveness of ADF operations from \nevaluation  reports;  (iii)  review  and  synthesize  studies  and  reports  on  ADB  reforms, \norganizational effectiveness and development effectiveness; (iv) review and synthesize existing \ndocuments assessing ADF operations including the relevant documents and reports; (v) analyze \nthe findings of the ongoing SESs;11 (vi) conduct field-level consultations in the top five ADF \nrecipient countries; (vii) interview ADB project officers involved in ADF operations; and (viii) \ndiscuss initial study findings at a workshop with key DMC representatives and development \npartners.  \n \n11.  Special evaluation study of post-completion sustainability of ADB projects. The \naim of this SES is to assess the sustainability of ADB-funded projects and programs, keeping in \nmind the questions and issues discussed in paras. 5 and 6 (above). The SES will cover public \nsector project and program loans and their associated TA projects. The study will cover the \nfollowing  subsectors,  which  receive  significant  ADB  assistance:  (i)  pre-primary  and  basic \neducation; (ii) conventional energy, energy sector development, and large hydropower; (iii) road \ntransport; (iv) water supply and sanitation; (v) finance sector development; and (vi) small and \nmedium-sized enterprise development. \n \n12.  In particular, the study will (i) assess, based on all evaluation ratings since 2001, the \ntemporal,  sectoral,  modality,  and  country  patterns  of  sustainability  ratings;  (ii)  study  the \nrelationship between effectiveness and/or efficiency and sustainability; (iii) analyze the reasons \nfor high and low sustainability ratings; (iv) review literature to help identify the critical success \nfactors for sustainability; (v) make case studies in four selected sectors to examine how ADB \nidentified and mitigated sustainability risks at each stage of the project cycle; (vi) examine the \nsustainability  of  projects  chosen  for  case  studies  and  their  post-completion  monitoring  by \nexecuting  agencies;    (vii)  compare  ADB's  policies  for  promoting  project  and  program \nsustainability with those of other multilateral development banks; and (viii) based on the above, \ndraw  inferences  regarding  ADB's  policy  and/or  approach  to  sustainability  and  make \nrecommendations for improvement.  \n \n13.  Study  on  support  to  agribusiness  to  promote  value  chains  for  inclusive \ndevelopment. The evaluation will cover all stages in the value chain\u2014from farm production and \npost production systems including processing and marketing, and their interdependencies. The \nstudy will focus on high value farm and agribusiness products produced by micro, small and \nmedium  enterprises  and/or  households  located  mainly  in  rural  areas.  The  study  will  be \nconducted in two stages. The first stage will assess ADB's assistance in promoting commercial \nagriculture in DMCs based on a review of completed evaluation reports. The second stage will \nassess  the  performance,  relevance,  effectiveness  of  the  ongoing  and  completed  projects \napproved between 2001 and 2009 in developing agribusiness and value chain. The study will \n                                                 \n10  To enable the evaluation to start immediately, a minor change in scope under ADB. 2009.

The balance required to complete the evaluation will be funded through the proposed TA. \n11  On (i) weakly performing countries, (ii) gender and development, (iii) multisector, (iv) water policy, (v) project \nsustainability, and (vi) Lao People's Democratic Republic country and sector level evaluations. \n ", "5 \nexamine: (i) vertical integration from farm production and processing to logistic support, and to \nmarketing;  (ii)  coordination  and  linkages  between  agriculture,  logistic  systems,    and  other \nsectors; (iii) cost-effectiveness in out-reach to a large number of stakeholder and participants; \n(iv) stakeholder commitment; and (v) competitiveness and access to domestic and international \nmarkets.  \n  \n14.  Validation of regional cooperation partnership strategy and country partnership \nstrategy final reviews. Selectively, IED will validate the final reviews to feed into the respective \nfuture regional cooperation and country partnership strategies. \n \n15.  Sector and thematic evaluations. The TA will support selected country and sector, \nand/or thematic assessments needed to feed into high-level evaluation reports included in IED \nwork program. \n \n16.  Dissemination  of  evaluation  knowledge  products.  Disseminating  evaluation \nknowledge products at appropriate time, place and in a suitable form is an important objective of \nIED. The TA will provide expert inputs required to support IED staff to strengthen dissemination. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise \nthe preparation of reports for each evaluation study. Based on experience with similar studies, \nabout 18 person-months of international and about 31 person-months of national consulting \nservices will be required. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Detailed terms of \nreference will be given in the evaluation approach papers before action is taken to engage \nconsultants. ADB will engage consultants on an individual basis in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder the TA will be  made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA is estimated to start in June 2010 and \nbe completed in December 2011. Implementation arrangements will be flexible enough to allow \nchanges should IED\u2019s work program be altered including, as needed, responding to priorities \nunder Strategy 2020 and ADF X. ADB will obtain a no-objection from the DMC government prior \nto commencing any activity financed under this TA in the territory of the DMC concerned. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.
