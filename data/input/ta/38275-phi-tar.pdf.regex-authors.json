The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (the Government) requested the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  for  local \ngovernance and fiscal management. The TA is included in the Country Strategy and Program \n2005-2007 for the Philippines. Fact finding was conducted intermittently from July to August, \nafter which a memorandum of understanding was signed confirming the objective, scope, cost \nestimates,  financing,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Local Government Code of 1991 (LGC) was an ambitious effort to transform local \ngovernment  units  (LGUs)  from  mere  agents  of  the  national  Government  into  autonomous \nmanagers of the design, funding, and delivery of key government services at the local level. For \neach level of LGU2 a clear mandate and sphere of administrative and financial autonomy were \ndefined. The share of Government domestic revenues transferred to LGUs was doubled to \n40%,3 and LGUs were empowered to create their own revenue sources such as levies, taxes, \nfees, and charges, and to access credit markets.  \n \n3.  Fourteen years later, the LGU share of government operations has more than doubled, \nand decentralization is a reality in the Philippines. At the same time, the Government and \npeople  are  acutely  aware  that  the  ambitious  vision  of  effective  and  autonomous  local \ngovernance has been only partly realized. Devolution of expenditure authority to LGUs has \nbeen  complicated  by  ambiguities  and  contradictions  in  expenditure  assignments  between \nnational Government agencies (NGAs) and LGUs. LGU resource mobilization has frequently \nproven inadequate, leading to heavy dependence on transfers from the national budget and \ninsufficient resources for essential infrastructure investment. LGU tax administration, budgeting, \nand financial management processes are in many cases not up to the requirements of a \ndecentralized system. NGAs have not made some necessary adjustments to the changed \ndemands created by more autonomous LGUs and lack some of the necessary structures, \nprocedures,  and  information  systems  to  exercise  their  reformed  oversight  roles  in  local \ngovernment activities. Effective local governance is hindered by the weak legal and institutional \nframework for decentralization, as well as by capacity constraints both locally and nationally. \n \n4.  Inadequate  LGU  resource  mobilization  is  a  critical  constraint.  Cities  and  wealthier \nmunicipalities are often unable to take advantage of their economic strength to access financial \nmarkets to finance investment projects. Mid-level (level 3 and 4)4 municipalities need to build \ncreditworthiness to be able to access credit markets and also need to strengthen tax collections, \nparticularly  the  real  property  tax  and  business  tax.  Poorer  LGUs  require  improvements  in \nonlending and ongranting practices for Government and donor funds, and strengthened tax \ncollection capacity. It is also necessary to prepare adjustments in the internal revenue allotment \n(IRA), the main intergovernmental fiscal transfer instrument, in which the allocation formula \ndoes not consider the fiscal capacity of the LGU, so that LGUs with similar populations and land \nareas receive the same amount, even if their economic conditions are vastly different. Creating \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 13 July 2005.  \n2 There are three levels of LGUs, (i) directly below the national Government are provinces and certain cities \ndesignated as \u201chighly urbanized,\u201d (ii) under provincial supervision are component cities and municipalities; and (iii) \nbarangays, which are villages within a city or municipality and have very limited governing powers. \n3  That is, 40% of domestic revenues from 3 years earlier.  \n4  The Government classifies all LGUs into six income levels, with Level 1 the highest and Level 6 the lowest income. \n ", "2 \nan  additional  performance-based  transfer  mechanism  will  also  help  correct  current  poor \nincentives for IRA-dependent LGUs, as many LGUs that receive large transfers choose to avoid \nthe political costs of tougher tax collection.5  \n \n5.  Weak LGU expenditure management also limits the effectiveness of local governance. \nShortcomings include (i) excessive personnel expenses, crowding out spending on services and \ninvestment; (ii) the lack of long-term revenue and expenditure estimation capacity, weakening \ninvestment planning; (iii) undeveloped internal financial audit capacity; and (iv) opaque budget \nformulation and execution practices.  \n \n6.  A number of important new Government initiatives are being taken to strengthen LGU \nadministration and fiscal management. The Government issued Executive Order 444 in July \n2005, directing the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to identify activities of \nNGAs  and  government  corporations  that  should  be  devolved.  A  new  electronic  local \ngovernment accounting system (e-LGAS) is being rolled out to LGUs. The Bureau of Local \nGovernment Finance in the Department of Finance (DOF) is implementing a revised LGU \nfinancial reporting statement, the Statement of Income and Expenditures (SIE), to improve and \nstandardize the presentation of LGU budget numbers.  Initiatives are also underway to align the \nfinancial reports produced under the LGAS with the SIEs. DILG is also rolling out its new Local \nGovernment  Performance  Measurement  System,  which  focuses  on  indicators  of  service \ndelivery  and  provides  essential  information  on  assessing  overall  performance.  The \nimplementation of these vital initiatives now needs to be carefully managed and supported. \n \n7.  The  donor  community  has  actively  supported  improved  local  governance,  financial \nmanagement, and service delivery. ADB has extensive experience in this area. In 2003, ADB \nand the World Bank conducted a joint study on decentralized service delivery, which is a \nvaluable source of information on issues relevant to this TA. The two latest ADB TA projects \nwere approved in December 2004. TA for Strengthening Provincial and Local Planning and \nExpenditure Management6 will help establish efficient frameworks for provincial and other LGU \nplanning processes. TA for Local Government Finance and Budget Reform7 will strengthen the \ncapacity  of  three  key  national  government  agencies  that  support  or  directly  finance  LGU \nbudgeting: the Bureau of Local Government Finance, Municipal Finance Corporation, and Local \nGovernment Academy of DILG. Other donors, including the World Bank, Canadian International \nDevelopment Agency, Australian Agency for International Development and others, are active in \nLGUs as well. ADB coordinates closely with them through the recently established Government-\nDevelopment  Partners  Working  Group  on  Decentralization  and  Local  Government,  created \nduring the 2005 Philippines Development Forum.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to support the Government\u2019s fiscal consolidation and poverty \nreduction agendas by improving resource mobilization, expenditure management, and public \nservice delivery in LGUs, the front line of government social service provision, at which over \n20% of total government spending takes place. By developing LGU capacity to operate more \n                                                 \n5  See ADB and World Bank. 2005. Decentralization in the Philippines. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2004: Strengthening Provincial/Local Planning and Expenditure Management , Manila, (TA 4512). \n7  ADB. 2004: Local Government Finance and Budget Reform Project. Manila (TA 4556).  ", "      3 \nefficiently  and  effectively,  these  activities  will  contribute  to  improved  local  welfare  without \nrequiring additional Government transfers. The key outcomes of the TA will be: \n \n(i)   enhanced LGU access to budget resources, from traditional sources such as \ntaxes and fees, and from other sources including bank credit, bonds, and build-\noperate-transfer arrangements;  \n(ii)   improved LGU expenditure and financial management, leading to more effective \nservice delivery and infrastructure development; \n(iii)  improvements in the legal framework for decentralization; and \n(iv)   an  in-depth  assessment  of  Philippine  decentralization  to  date,  with \nrecommendations for new reform measures, including LGC revisions.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will support LGUs in developing sound and transparent fiscal frameworks that \nwill serve as a foundation for strengthened budgeting and access to credit markets. The TA \ncomprises an integrated package of activities that will address three key aspects of LGU fiscal \nmanagement:  (i)  an  improved  legal  framework  for  decentralization;  (ii)  transparency  and \neffectiveness in LGU expenditure management and budget processes; and (iii) LGU capacity to \nmobilize sufficient resources to finance necessary services to their constituents. These three \ncomponents of the work will proceed simultaneously and flexibly, with consulting assignments, \nworkshops and other activities planned to achieve maximum impact in all three areas. \n \n10.  Improved fiscal management and service delivery will be supported in a select group of \nprovinces and in cities and municipalities within those provinces. Around 3 provinces with \ncomponent LGUs will be selected for participation, based on criteria to be developed by the TA. \nParticipating provinces will include LGUs that have clear prospects for accessing credit markets. \nSome level 4-6 LGUs that have demonstrated commitment to improved governance will also be \nincluded. Other criteria will include proximity to other potential recipients of assistance in later \nTA phases and willingness to mentor them. Work with the LGU Leagues8 and NGAs will draw \non this experience to provide templates and examples that can assist other LGUs. \n \n11.  Component  A:  This  will  support  a  clearer  and  more  effective  legal  framework  for \ndecentralization, through the following activities: \n \n(i)   an in-depth study of the results to date of the Philippine decentralization process, \nwith recommendations for amendments to the LGC and other laws;  \n(ii)   support for accelerated devolution in accordance with Executive Order 444; \n(iii)  capacity  development  activities  for  DILG  and  other  NGAs  overseeing  the \ndecentralized LGUs, including reliable and timely data on LGU performance; \n(iv)  the  assessment  of  subnational  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  specifically \nflows from provinces to municipalities and barangays, with the development of \nproposals for improving the relevant laws and regulations; \n(v)  assessment of the impact of the current IRA formula and procedures on revenue \nadequacy, predictability, and collection incentives in participating LGUs, and the \ndevelopment of proposals for IRA reform; and \n                                                 \n8  The League of Provinces, League of Cities and League of Municipalities are NGOs that were established following \nthe ratification of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, to represent LGU interests in policy debates. ", "4 \n(vi)  implementation  of  capacity  development  plans  for  the  League  of  Provinces, \nLeague of Municipalities, and League of Cities, focusing primarily on their policy \nadvocacy functions. \n \n12.  Component B: This will support more effective and transparent LGU budget processes \nand public expenditure management. Key activities in expenditure management will include (i) \nimproved personal service expenditure policies; and (ii) in select LGUs, application of medium-\nterm  expenditure  frameworks  and  output-based  budgeting  techniques.  Support  for  a  more \ntransparent budget review, monitoring, and evaluation process, increasing citizen participation \nin the budget process, will include (i) support for the roll-out of the e-LGAS; (ii) support for the \ncreation  of  internal  audit  functions;  (iii)  an  assessment  of  progress  in  implementing  new \nprocurement practices, with support for improved implementation as required; and (iv) support \nfor implementing the Local Government Performance Measurement System. \n \n13.  Component C: This will strengthen LGU financial capacity to mobilize revenues and \nfacilitate the diversification of local borrowings. The TA will support expanded access to credit \nand bond markets through steps that include:  \n \n(i)  undertaking a creditworthiness assessment for each participating LGU;  \n(ii)  developing and implementing an action plan for strengthening fiscal management \nwith targeted training on borrowing strategies and debt management;  \n(iii)  examining options of creditworthy LGUs to access the LGU bond market, with \nadditional training in bond issuance; and  \n(iv)  preparing proposals and financing packages for key investment initiatives, with \nsupportive financing structures that may include official development assistance, \ncommercial  borrowing,  bond  flotation,  public\u2013private  partnership,  and  build-\noperate-transfer arrangements.  Possible financing sources include DOF\u2019s recent \nintroduction of program lending to LGUs, to support policy reforms in LGUs while \nproviding a new funding source for investment projects.9   \n \n14.  On the taxation side, the TA will support:  \n \n(i)   measures to tap additional resources;   \n(ii)   improvements in the administration of existing taxes, especially the real property \ntax and business tax;  \n(iii)   improved  management  of  LGU  properties  to  maximize  resources  while \nmaintaining a conducive environment for private sector development;  \n(iv)   training in revenue estimation; and \n(v)   developing an LGU revenue manual that can be utilized with other LGUs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $2,575,000  equivalent,  of  which  $495,000  is  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $2,080,000  equivalent  is  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $1,800,000 equivalent, covering all of the foreign exchange cost and \n$1,305,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant \nbasis through ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining local-\ncurrency  cost,  equivalent  to  $775,000,  covering  administrative  and  support  costs  including \n                                                 \n9 The first such lending was a four-tranche, P120 million program loan to the province of Negros Occidental to \nsupport procurement reforms in eight out of 13 component cities and 12 out of 19 municipalities.  ", "      5 \nsalaries  of  counterpart  staff,  secretarial  support,  supplies,  office  accommodation,  local \ntransportation,  miscellaneous  costs  for  training  courses,  and  per  diems  associated  with \nattendance at such events. Details of the cost estimates are set out in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be DILG. A steering committee will consist of \nDILG,  DOF,  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM),  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment  Authority,  and  representatives  of  the  League  of  Provinces  and  League  of \nMunicipalities.  DILG  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  component  A.  DBM  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency for component B. The Bureau of Local Government Finance of the DOF \nwill  be  the Implementing  Agency  for  component  C.  DILG  will  coordinate  with  DBM,  DOF, \nNational Economic and Development Authority, and the LGUs. The steering committee will \nmeet  at  least  quarterly,  at  which  time  written  project  assessments  of  progress  in \nimplementation, including recommendations of action to be undertaken to correct problems, will \nbe reviewed for discussion with the ADB project officer and project team leader. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months commencing in June 2006, with \ncompletion expected by May 2008. To implement the TA, the following consulting services will \nbe required: 16 person-months of international consultancy and 184 person-months of domestic \nconsultancy in the areas of local governance and decentralization; intergovernmental fiscal \nrelations;  tax  administration,  budgeting,  expenditure,  and  financial  management;  public \nadministration and management; organizational restructuring; human resource management; \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  and  structured  finance;  development  financing,  policy  reform, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and participation; and information and communication technology \n(ICT).  A consulting firm providing all the consulting services will be engaged by quality- and \ncost-based selection. All recruitment and engagement will undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  as  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. The outline terms \nof reference are attached as Appendix 3.  ICT equipment will be procured by the consultants, \nin  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  help  the  selected  provinces \nimplement the TA. After completion of the TA, the equipment will be transferred to the \nprovinces in which it was used.  \n \n18.  Within 1 month of the first TA consultants being fielded, an inception report will be \nrequired to outline the framework and processes to implement the TA. Participating LGUs will \nbe selected no later than by the end of month 2.  Reports on progress, upcoming plans, and \nissues to be resolved will be submitted by the team leader to the steering committee and ADB \nbefore the end of each project quarter. More detailed reports will be submitted at the end of \neach  project  year.  Processes  and  lessons  learned  under  the  TA  will  be  documented  into \nknowledge products and tools for sharing and replication. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,800,000  on  a  grant  basis  to  the  Government  of  the \nPhilippines for Local Governance and Fiscal Management Project.
