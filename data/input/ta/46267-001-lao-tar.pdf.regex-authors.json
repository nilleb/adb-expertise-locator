INTRODUCTION \n1.  Subprogram 1 of the Second Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nDevelopment  Program  (PSME2)  was  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in October 2011.1 Regulatory impact assessment (RIA) forms an \nintegral  part  of  PSME2,  and  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic          \n(Lao PDR) accordingly asked ADB for assistance in developing the government\u2019s capacity to \nimplement RIA, which will be the basis of subprogram 2 of PSME2, scheduled to be presented \nto the Board in 2013. In June 2012, a fact-finding mission visited the Lao PDR and reached an \nunderstanding with the government on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfor Implementing Regulatory Impact Assessment. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The government\u2019s Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan targets gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth of at least 8% annually, with GDP per capita reaching at least \n$1,700  by  2015.3 In  seeking  to  achieve  these  targets,  the  government  recognizes  that \ndevelopment of the private sector and small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) 4 is critical for \nbroad-based economic growth, especially if over-reliance on the natural resource sector is to be \navoided. This is reflected in the government\u2019s SME National Development Plan of 2012\u20132016. \nADB supports the government\u2019s priorities by focusing on expansion of the formal private sector \nthrough a supportive enabling environment.5 One of the most effective ways to do this is by \nintroducing tools and systems that promote regulatory efficiency. \n \n3.  The work on regulatory impact assessment is based on the analytical work undertaken \nby ADB in 2009,6 which underlined three important conclusions. First, the study estimated that \nfirms on average incur $483 annually to comply with the three most common licenses.7 Second, \nit costs the overall business community $32 million to comply with the three licenses.8 If all \nreported  enterprises  attained  the  three  permissions  then  the  total  cost  would  exceed          \nKN500 billion (1.4% of GDP). Enterprises may also require additional sector-specific licenses \nthat would raise total business compliance costs. A realistic estimate of business compliance \ncosts was 1.5%\u20133.0% of GDP in 2008. Third, the burden of business regulatory costs falls \nheaviest on micro- and small enterprises. For example, the corresponding cost per employee \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster, \nand Loan and Grant for Subprogram 1 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic  for the Second Private Sector and \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program.  Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 July 2012.  \n3 Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2011. Seventh Five-Year National Socio- \nEconomic Development Plan (2011\u20132015). Vientiane. \n4  More than 95% of all enterprises in the Lao PDR are SMEs, which are defined as enterprises with (i) (on average) \nless than 99 employees, (ii) total assets not exceeding KN1,200,000,000; or (iii) annual turnover not exceeding \nKN1,000,000,000.  \n5  Registration of enterprises through the enterprise registration offices supported by ADB\u2019s TA has been successful, \nand is a prerequisite for these enterprises to access finance and services, both of which are essential for \nexpansion.  \n6   ADB. 2009. Options for Regulatory Review Program and Office of Best Regulatory Practice. Manila. \n7  These are (i) KN1.69 million ($199) to renew operational permission, KN0.95 million ($112) to renew enterprise \nregistration, and KN1.46 million ($172) to renew the tax certificate. \n8  This is based on the 2006 economic census reports which reported that there are 126,913 primary economic units; \nsome 71% hold current tax certificates and 40% have registration certificates. \n ", "2 \n \nincreased  from  KN27,214  for  large  enterprises  to  KN225,338  for  small  enterprises  and \nKN258,442 for microenterprises. \n \n4.  These numbers resulted in strong government ownership of the RIA program. RIA is a \nsystematic process for improving regulation and policy development, based on the three key \nprinciples  of  good  practice  regulation:  (i)  promoting  evidence-based  policy  development,            \n(ii) transparency in policy making, and (iii) consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. RIA \nalso documents the policy development process through the publication of a regulatory impact \nassessment checklist or regulatory impact statement, which reports on the consultation process \nand  tries  to  quantify  the  benefits  and  costs  of  the  proposed  regulation  on  the  business \ncommunity, consumers and economy. Best international practice suggests that institutionalizing \nRIA in government requires three key elements: (i) multiple ministries and line agencies to carry \nout  and  demonstrate  the  value  of  RIA  throughout  the  government;  (ii)  a  legal  framework \nmandating  RIA  requirements  in  government;  (iii)  an  office  of  best  practice  regulation  that \nprovides information advocacy on best practice, builds government capacity to carry out RIA, \nand monitors RIA compliance.  \n \n5.  With  ADB  support  through  the  first  Private  Sector  and  Small  and  Medium-sized \nEnterprises Development Program 19 and PSME2, the RIA program in the Lao PDR follows \ngood international practice, through sequencing a series of steps towards institutionalizing RIA \nin the national government. First, a RIA interagency taskforce, chaired by the vice minister for \nindustry and commerce, was established in 2009 to oversee the drafting of a national strategy \nand build awareness of RIA in the national government.  The task force members include \nseveral ministries\u2014the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), \nand Ministry of Finance (MOF)\u2014as well as the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the chamber of \ncommerce.  The  first  RIA  program  pilot  was  implemented  in  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and \nCommerce  (MOIC)  in  2011.  The  MOIC  pilot  established  a  RIA  unit  under  the  permanent \nsecretary\u2019s office comprised of four MOIC staff. A manual, checklist and template for RIAs have \nbeen produced and endorsed. A RIA work plan listing the regulations and legislation that will be \nsubject  to  a  RIA  was  endorsed  and  is  currently  being  implemented;  the  first  RIA  on  the \nPromotion of Small and Medium Enterprises Law, was completed and promulgated by the \nPresident on 16 January 2012. Second, the law on lawmaking included several provisions on \nRIA that will mandate RIA in national government after a transition period. Third, the draft RIA \nstrategy includes references to the possibility of establishing an office of best practice regulation \nin the medium term. The adoption of the national strategy and the rollout of RIA units in other \nministries are policy triggers for the second subprogram of PSME2.  \n \n6.  The government has proposed setting up additional RIA units in MPI, MOF, and MOJ.            \nIn addition, the Economic Planning and Finance Committee of the National Assembly has also \nagreed to host a RIA unit. The committee views itself as a gatekeeper for ensuring the quality of \nproposed legislation and considers RIA as an important process and tool in that process. All \nagencies are preparing draft work plans to implement the RIA in 2012. Under ADB\u2019s assistance \n(through  the  Urban  Development  and  Water  Division)  to  the  water  resources  sector,  a \nregulatory  expert  will  be  engaged  to  assist  with  RIA  in  that  sector.  This  activity  is  being \ncoordinated between the Urban Development and Water Division and the Public Management, \nFinancial Sector and Trade Division.  \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grant and Technical Assistance Grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Private Sector and \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program Cluster (Subprogram 1). Manila.   \n ", "3 \n \n7.  Some lessons from the current RIA pilot at MOIC are applicable to expansion of the RIA.  \nThe challenges are (i) to build a critical mass of staff familiar with RIA processes; (ii) to ensure \ncompliance with RIA within each agency (each line ministry has several departments and \ndirectorates that often act independent of each other, so effort is required to ensure their \ncompliance);  and  (iii)  to  strengthen  the  interface  between  government  and  the  business \ncommunity, including access to information from business generally, and SMEs in particular.    \n \n8.  Therefore, the TA has three purposes: (i) assist the government in implementing RIA in \nfour additional government units, and building a critical mass of staff with knowledge of the RIA \ntools; (ii) assist the government with an eventual national rollout of RIA, including establishment \nof an office of best practice regulation; and (iii) build demand for quality regulations through \noutreach activities with the business community and the public. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA is necessary to expand the scope of the RIA program to MOJ, MOF, MPI, and \nthe National Assembly and to build public demand for quality regulations. Demand for quality \nregulations will be increased through a series of public outreach activities, including developing \na community of RIA practitioners outside the government, and updating estimates of the annual \ncost to business of compliance with general permissions. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is RIA institutionalized in government. The indicator for the impact \nis a 15% reduction in the cost of business compliance. The outcome of the TA is RIA piloted \nacross government, with an indicator of at least five preliminary RIAs completed in each RIA \nunit.10 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The three outputs are mutually reinforcing. First, the national RIA strategy, which will \nserve as an anchor document, will need to be endorsed by the government. The existing \nstrategy was endorsed by the vice minister of MOIC, and although sufficient to set up the pilot \nunit in MOIC, a national rollout of the RIA will require that the strategy be updated to take into \naccount the needs of the different ministries, and be approved by a higher level of government. \nThe strategy will be circulated for comments and revisions will be made. The second output is to \ndevelop  and  strengthen  staff  capacity  in  the  RIA  units  of  the  participating  ministries  and \ncommittee  of  the  National  Assembly.  This  will  be  done  through  various  capacity-building \ninitiatives, including focused workshops, attachment programs from line departments, and a \nstudy visit to a jurisdiction with developed RIA systems. Finally, the TA will support several \npublic outreach programs to demonstrate the benefit of RIA to society, including the private \nsector. Support from the private sector is crucial to maintain the momentum of the RIA. This \nincludes  a  proposed  international  conference  with  participation  from  Cambodia  and  the \nPhilippines. ADB is supporting implementation of RIA in these countries and the sharing of \nexperience will be useful.11 The full list of activities is contained in the design and monitoring \n                                                \n1T0 hOeu tvcioemwes  aenxdp roeustpsuetds  hmearye hina vaer em tohroes teh aonf  othnee  icnodnicsautoltra. nFtu all npde rdfoor mnaont cnee tcaergsestasr ialyn dr einpdriecsaetonrts  tahroes ien  othfe A dDeBsi\u2019gsn  \nmaenmdb meorsn,i tBoroinagr dfr aomf Dewiroerckt.o rs, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n11 The Promoting Economic Diversification Program in Cambodia included RIA policy actions that were supported by \na project component. Cambodia has established an office of RIA at the national level (ADB. 2010. Report and \nRecommendation of the President: Proposed Loan and Grant for Subprogram 2 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for \nthe Promoting Economic Diversification Program. Manila). In the Philippines, ADB\u2019s inputs on RIA are made \n ", "4 \n \nframework.  Achieving  the  full  impact  of  the  TA  will  require  effective  coordination  between \nministries and between departments within a ministry in adopting a strategy and work plan; a \nrisk to the project is that inadequate cost\u2013benefit analysis capacity will reduce the impact of RIA, \nwhich may reduce the enthusiasm of line ministries to take on RIA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV), given the importance of this TA \nto support RIA as a component of subprogram 2 of PSME2.  The government will provide   \ncounterpart support in the form of office space for consultants, and other in-kind contributions.       \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The executing agency will be MOIC. As the first ministry to pilot RIA, MOIC is the RIA \nchampion  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  MOJ,  MOF,  MPI,  and  the \nNational Assembly. The government\u2019s inter-ministerial steering committee\u2014headed by the vice \nminister of MOIC and including representatives from MPI, MOF, MOJ, the National Assembly, \nand the private sector (Lao Chamber of Commerce)\u2014will coordinate implementation of the TA. \nThe TA will be implemented over 24 months, from November 2012 to November 2014. It will \nrequire 31 person-months of international consulting services and 12 person-months of national \nconsulting  services,  including  a  strategic  policy  expert  (international,  7  person-months);              \n2 regulatory experts (international, 12 person-months each); and one communications and \nmedia expert (national, 12 person-months). All consultants will be engaged on an individual \nbasis.  \n \n14.  All consultants will be hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment and office supplies to be financed by the TA \nwill be procured by the consultants or ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). All equipment procured under this TA will be turned over to the executing agency upon \ncompletion of the TA. The outputs and outcome evaluation will be disseminated through the \ninternational conference and RIA reports published by the Government. The terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3.     \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the Lao People's Democratic Republic for Implementing Regulatory Impact  \nAssessment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nthrough the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program (ADB. 2012.
