INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strengthening public financial management (PFM) systems and practices in Papua New \nGuinea (PNG) will improve the government\u2019s ability to effectively and efficiently utilize public \nfinances for service delivery and infrastructure provision. PFM is an important component of the \ngovernment\u2019s  medium-term  development  plan.  The  plan  focuses  on  (i) improving  and \nstrengthening  public  sector  reform,  (ii)  improving  budgeting  and  financial  management  for \neffective  service  delivery,  and  (iii)  enforcing  accountability  and  transparency  initiatives. 1 \nDevelopment partners coordinate PFM reform efforts using a framework for fiscal enhancement \n(FFE)  where  government  efforts,  supported  by  the  development  partners,  focus  on  fiscal \nmanagement and PFM.2 \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will support ongoing PFM reform in PNG by focusing on \nareas identified in the FFE and aligned with the priorities of ADB\u2019s ongoing programs and \nprojects in PNG. The TA will (i) support the design and implementation of systems for financing \nthe construction and maintenance of infrastructure from a newly created sovereign wealth fund, \nand (ii) strengthen the accountability of statutory authorities to the national government. The TA \nhas been conceptualized and designed through consultations during the preparation of the \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS),3 as well as a TA fact-finding mission in September 2012. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Two  components  of  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  PNG  are  good  governance  and \nsovereign wealth management (footnote 3). Improved governance will ensure more effective \nand efficient utilization of public finances for service delivery and infrastructure provision, and \nwill be critical in the context of the anticipated sudden gains in revenues from the liquefied \nnatural gas  (LNG)  project  and  other  major mining  projects. The  CPS  notes  that  ADB  will \ncontinue to support the government-wide FFE led by the departments of finance and treasury; \nand efforts to increase governance standards for infrastructure projects, statutory authorities, \nand state-owned enterprises. \n \n4.  On  sovereign  wealth  management,  there  is  a  need  for  skillful  management  of  the \npotential  adverse  macroeconomic  implications  of  large  resource  projects.  During  the  CPS \nimplementation period, ADB plans to help the government prepare for the expected mineral \nrevenue. PNG will also need to ensure that revenue from LNG and other mining and petroleum \nprojects is efficiently and equitably utilized, and aligned with development priorities. Increasing \ngovernance standards, particularly with regard to the management of revenue from petroleum \nand mining projects, is essential to ensuring that the government can convert financial wealth \ninto  broad-based  delivery  of  basic  services.  ADB  will  therefore  continue  to  support  the \ngovernment to strengthen PFM (footnote 3). \n                                                \n1  Government of Papua New Guinea, Department of National Planning and Monitoring. 2010.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 October 2012. \n ", "2   \n5.  The most recent public expenditure and financial accountability assessment confirmed \nprogress in several PFM areas.5 The debt burden is significantly lower and more balanced \nthrough the effective implementation of a debt strategy and the application of fiscal surpluses to \nreduce debt. Budget preparation is more orderly, transparent, and consultative as a result of the \nFiscal Responsibility Act. Furthermore, the government has strengthened fiscal planning and \nexpenditure management by adhering to principles laid out in two successive 5-year medium-\nterm fiscal strategies, first implemented in 2003. \n \n6.  However, important weaknesses impede the government\u2019s ability to control expenditures, \ndisburse the budget as approved, and provide essential services. Fundamental arrangements \nare  in  place,  but  implementation  weaknesses  mean  that  the  systems  and  procedures  for \nexpenditure control cannot be relied upon to ensure appropriate accountability. Transparency in \nbudget execution is weak, with budget integrity undermined by the unauthorized diversion of \nfunds,  including  resources  for  regional  development.  Tracking  expenditures  to  ensure  the \nbudget is delivered as approved is difficult. Statutory authority accountability is particularly weak. \nIn addition, the greater responsibility being given to provincial governments has impacted PFM, \nstretching the limited human resources available to manage the country\u2019s financial systems. \n \n7.  The TA will support further improvements in PFM by focusing on areas identified in the \nFFE. The FFE has three priority areas (i) managing financial volatility by maintaining long-term \nfiscal  sustainability  and  safeguarding  sudden  gains  in  revenues;6 (ii) strengthening  service \ndelivery  through  budget  expenditure  prioritization  and  effective  implementation;  and \n(iii) reinforcing the integrity of budget systems and processes by delivering comprehensive, \ntransparent, and accountable budgets.7 The TA will (i) support the design and implementation of \nsystems for financing the construction and maintenance of infrastructure from the sovereign \nwealth  fund,  and  (ii) strengthen  the  accountability  of  statutory  authorities  to  the  national \ngovernment. \n \n8.  The  sovereign  wealth  fund  aims  to  reduce  fiscal  volatility  by  safeguarding  sudden \nincreases  in  revenues.  Parliament  approved  the  Organic  Law  on  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund \nManagement  on  21  February  2012; the  law  offers  significant  advantages for  directing  the \nmanagement of volatile resource revenues over current policies.  The law provides for the \ncreation of a number of new funding mechanisms and agencies that will receive revenues \naccruing to the government as a result of its equity stake in the LNG project. Under the law, all \nfuture mining, oil, and gas revenues will be deposited into an offshore stabilization fund, which \nwill be overseen by an independent board and subject to enhanced governance, transparency, \nand asset management rules. Withdrawals from the stabilization fund will be fully integrated into \nthe national budget process and restricted to the average of the past 15 years of mineral \nrevenues. \n \n9.  Working  in  close  coordination  with  the  interdepartment  sovereign  wealth  fund \nimplementation secretariat, and the development partners sovereign wealth fund coordination \ngroup,  the  TA  will  support  the  design  and  implementation  of  systems  for  financing  the \nmaintenance and construction of infrastructure from the sovereign wealth fund, either based on \n                                                \n5  Government of Papua New Guinea, Department of Finance. 2009. Public Financial Management Performance \nReport. Port Moresby. \n6  One of PNG\u2019s continuing challenges is to manage financial volatility inherent in the economy, which heavily relies \non extractive industries such as mining and petroleum. \n7  Reinforcing the integrity of budget systems and processes\u2014ensuring that actual budget spending complies with \nbudget allocations, funds reach intended budget organizations, there are no leakages on the way, and budget \norganizations maintain the mix of actual spending conducive to service delivery\u2014remains a challenge. \n ", "  3 \na  proposed  independent  authority  model  that  will  fund  investment  in  infrastructure,  or  an \nalternative arrangement once agreed by the government.8 \n \n10.  The PNG sovereign wealth fund secretaries committee has approved an implementation \nplan to operationalize the sovereign wealth fund in 2013. The Department of Treasury has \nasked ADB to help address a number of key implementation issues related to integrating the \nproposed structure into their existing systems. Key issues to be addressed include the (i) policy \nand  legislative  framework,  (ii)  institutional  framework,  (iii) definition  of  public  infrastructure \nassets, (iv) management structure, (v) criteria for project selection, and (vi) project and financial \noperating issues. The role of existing agencies and the relationship of any new arrangement \nwith the existing agencies needs to be considered. \n \n11.  Currently, the Department of Finance does not have a unit dedicated to monitoring the \napproximately 80 statutory authorities in PNG. In 2008, the government commissioned a report \ninto  the  governance  of  statutory  authorities,  which  recommended  the  establishment  of  a \ndedicated  statutory  authorities  unit.9 More  recently,  statutory  authorities  have  expressed \nconcern about the lack of engagement between central agencies and the statutory authorities, \nand  requested  that  a  first  point  of  contact  be  identified.  The  Department  of  Finance  has \ntherefore approved the establishment of a new statutory authorities monitoring branch. \n \n12.  The current accountability framework for statutory authorities is deficient in a number of \nareas, including (i) noncompliance with reporting provisions, financial measures, structures, and \npolicies;  (ii)  lack  of  demonstrable  service  delivery  improvements  and  outcomes;  (iii)  the \noperation of competitive programs and strategies that undermine government\u2019s public programs \nand  national  priorities;  (iv)  dilution  of  policy  control  and  direction  in  the  management  and \nprotection of finances, key assets, and natural resources; and (v) control failures by central \nagencies resulting in statutory authorities collecting and retaining increasing streams of public \nrevenues and committing to unsustainable increases in year-on-year expenditures. \n \n13.  The Department of Finance has, therefore, requested ADB support to assist in the initial \nestablishment and operation of the new statutory authorities monitoring branch. The branch will \nmonitor compliance of statutory authorities with the governance framework, and, more generally, \nwill monitor the performance of statutory authorities against their performance plans.10 \n \n14.  Both  the  sovereign  wealth  fund  implementation  support  and  the  statutory  authority \nsupport is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s existing operations in PNG, given the CPS focus on \nrehabilitating PNG\u2019s transport infrastructure network; and ADB\u2019s existing projects with a number \n                                                \n8  Various models are being considered as possible arrangements for financing the maintenance and construction of \ninfrastructure from the sovereign wealth fund, including (i) a proposed independent authority model to maintain \nexisting national infrastructure, and supervise construction of new infrastructure by the government, including \nroads, airports, ports, and hospitals; (ii) an initiative led by the Department of Transport and Department of Works \nfor a public\u2013private partnership transaction office; and (iii) a proposed public\u2013private partnership center to be \nestablished once public\u2013private partnership legislation currently before Parliament is approved. \n9  ADB. 2008.

ADB\u2019s  recent  support  for  PFM  in  PNG  was  through  TA  for  Support  for  Public \nExpenditure Review and Rationalization,11 and Supporting Public Financial Management.12 This \nTA will build on the progress made under the latter TA, rated successful in the TA completion \nreport.13 \n \n16.  The main lesson from the Supporting Public Financial Management TA is that, for TA to \nhave  impacts  across  the  government  sector,  all  of  the  government  must  support  the  TA \nobjectives. In addition, some logistical issues impacted TA delivery. The TA completion report \nnoted  the  importance  of  carefully  confirming  counterpart  contributions,  particularly  in  weak \ncapacity agencies, where facilities are limited. The completion report also notes that issues such \nas  strengthening  oversight  of  statutory  authorities  are  critical  to  improving  development \noutcomes in PNG and need to receive continued support from development partners. More \ngenerally, efforts to improve PFM capacity in PNG are challenging with modest achievements; \nthis justifies the highly focused initiative proposed. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact is to contribute to more effective and efficient utilization of public finances for \nservice  delivery  and  infrastructure  provision.14 The  outcome  is  strengthened  PFM  systems \nthrough  improved  transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency  in  national  government \nmanagement and use of public resources. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  The TA will deliver the following outputs (and associated activities) during 2012\u20132014. \n \n19.  Support the design and implementation of systems for financing the construction \nand  maintenance  of  infrastructure  from  the  sovereign  wealth  fund. The TA, in close \ncoordination  with  the  sovereign  wealth  fund  implementation  secretariat,  will  (i)  prepare  a \ncomprehensive  concept  paper  on  various  options  for  financing  the  construction  and \nmaintenance  of  infrastructure  from  the  sovereign  wealth  fund,  (ii)  undertake  consultation \nworkshops  with  government  agencies  and  development  partners  on  the  concept  paper, \n(iii) support expert peer reviews of the proposed options, (iv) prepare a detailed implementation \nplan of the preferred option, and (v) provide support on the establishment and implementation of \nthe final proposal once agreed, including capacity building support. \n \n20.  Strengthen the accountability of statutory authorities to the national government. \nThe TA, in close coordination with the Department of Finance, will (i) develop a 2013 work plan \n                                                \n11 ADB.  2007.

Once \nthe branch is established, the TA will support the branch in undertaking monitoring of an initial \ngroup of pilot statutory authorities and training branch staff in undertaking this monitoring. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which the full amount will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  government  will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation for consultants, provision of \ncounterpart staff and support services, and other in-kind contributions. Disbursements under the \nTA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The Department of Treasury will be the executing agency. The Department of Treasury \nand the Department of Finance will be the implementing agencies. \n \n23.  The TA will require international consultants (estimated 25 person-months) with skills \nand expertise in economics, finance, PFM, or governance, particularly in fund management \ngovernance arrangements, and statutory authority governance. All consultants will be engaged \nas individuals. ADB will engage consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n24.  TA activities will be implemented from 1 December 2012 to 31 October 2014. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n25.  Monitoring of the TA will draw on findings of assessments by ADB and development \npartners  including  ADB\u2019s  country  performance  assessment  for  PNG,  and  the  next  public \nexpenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment.  Detailed  activities  will  be  monitored \nthrough the review of TA outputs and feedback from the executing and implementing agencies. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n26.
