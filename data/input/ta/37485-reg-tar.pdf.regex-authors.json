The  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program  is  a  unique \nalliance  of  eight  countries  supported  by  six  multilateral  institutions1 working  to  achieve \ndevelopment  through  cooperation,  leading  to  accelerated  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is the program secretariat. At the core of the \nProgram is an overall institutional framework (OIF) that comprises (i) an annual ministerial \nconference that makes policy and strategic decisions and provides guidance in all areas of the \nProgram; (ii) senior officials' meetings (SOM) that coordinate cross-sectoral issues and prepare \nfor  ministerial  conferences;  (iii)  sector  coordinating  committees  for  transport,  energy,  trade \nfacilitation,  and  trade  policy  that  coordinate  sectorwide  issues,  strategy  articulation,  and \nprogram  development  and  implementation;  and  (iv)  a  national  focal  point  (NFP)  in  each \nparticipating country, that ensures effective coordination among government agencies and other \nparties concerned. The OIF drives the CAREC Program's collaborative approach to the design \nand implementation of concrete development initiatives, the benefits of which stretch beyond \nnational frontiers. The importance of continued support to the OIF has been highlighted in a \nnumber of technical assistance completion reports.2  \n \n2.  At  CAREC\u2019s  fifth  ministerial  conference  in  October  2006,  ministers  adopted  the \ncomprehensive action plan (CAP),3 underscoring their countries' strong commitment to pursuing \nregional cooperation. The CAP is being implemented through the OIF and will guide the work of \nthe Program over the medium term. Ministers expressed appreciation for ADB's contribution as \nprogram  secretariat  and  requested  continued  strong  support  for  the  CAREC  Program  to \naccelerate the momentum of cooperation and to ensure efficient and effective implementation of \nthe CAP.4 In response to this request, and given ADB's strong commitment to the CAREC \nProgram and to regional cooperation and integration,5 this regional technical assistance (RETA) \nwill support the smooth and proactive functioning of the CAREC OIF in 2007\u20132009. The RETA \ndesign and monitoring framework is shown in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The case for regional economic cooperation among CAREC countries is clear. The \ngeographical,  economic,  and  historical  context,  as  well  as  the  asymmetrical  distribution  of \nnatural resources in the region, makes CAREC countries uniquely interdependent and points to \nthe substantial benefits of improved regional cooperation.7 Economic development and poverty \nreduction are best supported through rapid, sustained, pro-poor, and inclusive growth. Fostering \nsuch  growth  in  CAREC  countries  will  require  efficient  regional  transport  infrastructure, \nrehabilitation of energy networks, and seamless transit of goods across the region to external \nmarkets. Further progress in each of these areas is contingent on regional cooperation.  \n                                                 \n1  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan, \nUzbekistan; and ADB, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank. \n2  ADB. 2000.

(p. 207), the UNDP states: \"\u2026 after 10 years \nof comprehensive regional cooperation and integration, as compared with the status quo of limited efforts, we \nconclude that GDP could be between 50 percent and 100 percent higher\".  \n ", "2   \n \n4.  In  line  with  ADB's  1994  policy  on  regional  cooperation,8 the  CAREC  Program  has \nfollowed a phased approach, moving from economic analysis and institutional assessments to \nidentification and prefeasibility analysis of investment projects, and on to expanded support for \npolicy dialogue and institutional reform. The Program's focus on improving infrastructure and \npolicy and institutional environments in the priority areas of transport, energy, and trade to (i) \nlessen the region's geographic disadvantages, (ii) promote intra- and interregional trade and \ntransit,  and  (iii)  enhance  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources,  is  well-aligned  with  ADB's \nMedium-Term Strategy II9 and Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy.10  \n \n5.  From the establishment of the CAREC Unit in 2000 to the end of April 2007, ADB \napproved 16 loans totaling $500 million for 12 regional investment projects related to CAREC's \npriority sectors. Cofinancing of $134 million was mobilized for seven of these projects.11  \n \n6.  This support has included RETAs for the development and operation of CAREC's OIF. \nMajor lessons learned from these RETAs include that (i) regional cooperation is a long-term \nprocess requiring sustained political will and mutual trust; (ii) a lack of understanding of the \nbenefits of regional cooperation, and the costs of noncooperation, constitute an obstacle to \ndeepening regional cooperation; (iii) institutional and capacity development is required to enable \ncooperation; and (iv) tangible results are needed to further advance regional cooperation.12  \n \n7.  These lessons inform the CAP, which represents the beginning of a new phase of the \nCAREC Program. The CAP will ensure that investments in the priority areas of transport, trade, \nand energy13 are coordinated and that CAREC serves as a proactive facilitator of practical \nregional projects and policy initiatives. The CAP also provides for broadening the Program on a \nproject-specific  basis  in  new  second-tier  areas  (human  resource  development,  agriculture, \nenvironment, disaster management and preparedness, and tourism).  \n \n8.  The  ongoing  development  of  sector  strategies  in  transport,  energy,  and  trade14 is \nexpected to result in a significantly expanded program of regional projects and policy actions. \nEach strategy will provide (i) a clear long-term vision expressing the shared objectives of \nparticipating countries, (ii) measurable actions in the short term (1\u20132 years) and medium term \n(3\u20135 years), and (iii) policy measures and priority investments required to achieve the actions.15 \n  \n9.  Smooth functioning of the OIF will be critical to maintaining the Program's momentum, \nsupporting the adoption of the sector strategies, and effectively implementing both the strategies \nand the expanded work program contained in the CAP. A number of important challenges lie \nbefore the CAREC Program.  \n \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 1994. Bank Support for Regional Cooperation. Manila. \n9  ADB. 2006.

CAREC will contribute by providing an environment for frank project-\noriented discussion at the committee, senior official, and ministerial level. \n(ii)  Institutionalizing a regional perspective in project and policy dialogue to ensure \ndecisions promote region-wide development. CAREC will contribute by fulfilling \nthe commitment in the CAP to bring regional perspectives into development \nplanning of participating countries and multilateral institutions. \n(iii)  Strengthening the strategic clarity of the Program. This will be achieved through \nthe sector strategies and through establishing the CAREC Institute16 to undertake \nresearch, training, and dialogue activities to support opportunity analysis and \ninformed decision making (para. 16).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the RETA will be accelerated economic growth and poverty reduction in \nthe CAREC countries. Through support for the OIF and CAREC Institute, the RETA will enable \nthe CAREC Program to implement the CAP and the sector strategies (transport, energy, and \ntrade)  which  are  being  prepared,  and  strengthen  the  collaborative  approach  to  concept-\ndevelopment, design, and implementation of concrete projects and policy actions to improve \ntransport connectivity, facilitate rational management and use of energy and natural resources, \nand enable increased trade among CAREC participating countries and with external markets. \nThese actions will contribute to economic growth and improved living standards in CAREC \ncountries. The RETA will also support analytical work and capacity development to enable the \nOIF to make informed decisions on strategic questions facing the Program and guide the \nbroadening and deepening of the Program into a second tier of activities on a project basis. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Drawing on lessons learned from completed CAREC RETAs, appropriate flexibility will \nbe applied in implementation to accommodate the evolving nature of the Program and to ensure \nthe secretariat is able to effectively respond to the directions set by the annual ministerial \nconference. The conference outcomes will shape an annual CAREC work program to ensure \nthe practical, project-based focus of the Program is maintained. The RETA will strengthen the \nOIF, and thereby the CAREC Program, through outputs in the following three areas.  \n \n1.  Strengthening Regional Cooperation \n12.  The RETA will further develop and maintain an environment for open and frank dialogue \non regional cooperation issues as a means to deepen mutual trust and understanding among \nparticipating countries. The RETA will fund CAREC ministerial conferences, senior officials\u2019 \nmeetings (SOM), meetings of sector coordinating committees, and other meetings under the \nOIF, including those in support of second-tier activities, in the period 2007\u20132009.17 These \n                                                 \n16 The  institute  will  begin  small-scale  operations  with  seed  financing  from  ADB  and  utilizing  information  and \ncommunication technologies to reduce costs. It is anticipated that governments within and outside the CAREC \nregion, as well as other multilateral and bilateral development partners, will provide support in future. \n17 This is anticipated to include three ministerial conferences; SOMs in 2007, 2008 and 2009; and support for sector \ncommittee  meetings  as  needed.  Other  meetings  would  include,  development  partners'  forums,  in-country \nconsultations among ministries, NFP advisors' meetings, bilateral or multilateral meetings on projects or issues \naffecting a subset of CAREC countries or a subset of CAREC countries and development partners. \n ", "4   \nmeetings  will  play  a  vital  role  in  fostering  a  regional  perspective  on  cooperation  and \ndevelopment  shared  by  all  participating  countries  that  will  facilitate  (i)  the  formulation  and \nimplementation  of  the  strategic  direction  of  the  Program;  (ii)  the  development  and \nimplementation  of  regional  sector  strategies  for  transportation,  energy,  and  trade;  (iii)  the \nformulation of prioritized regional investment programs and design of regional projects; and (iv) \nthe monitoring of program performance and results. The RETA will support closer coordination \nwith  other  development  partners  and  regional  organizations  to  maximize  opportunities  for \nregional cooperation, and to avoid overlap and duplication of effort.18  \n \n13.  In addition, the RETA will support the CAREC NFP in each participating country by \nfunding national advisors to the NFP and local regional cooperation coordinators (RCCs). These \npeople  will  facilitate  the  smooth  functioning  of  the  OIF  and  substantive  interaction  among \ndelegations at CAREC meetings. The national advisors will assist the NFPs with in-country \ncoordination among ministries and agencies involved in, or impacted by, CAREC Program \ndecisions to ensure timely implementation of CAREC agreements, and, with the RCCs, facilitate \ncommunication with the secretariat. Among other tasks, the RCCs will support preparation of \nreports and organization of meetings and other events. Senior advisors will advise the CAREC \nUnit on program management. A special advisor will assist the secretariat in engaging CAREC \ncountries in defining and implementing regional cooperation and integration initiatives, and \nnetworking with development partners in mobilizing resources for regional cooperation. \n \n2.  Analytical Work in Support of Planning and Establishment of the CAREC \nInstitute \n14.  The CAREC Program has produced reports assessing regional cooperation options for \nCAREC countries. These analyses have added substance to a growing understanding of the \npotential benefits of cooperation and, importantly, the costs of noncooperation. The RETA will \nsupport further analytical work to facilitate well-informed, realistic decision making based on a \nclear understanding of the potential gains, drawbacks, and risks involved in various regional \ncooperation initiatives, and to strengthen the Program\u2019s strategic direction. \n \n15.  The  RETA  will  also  support  establishment  of  a  CAREC  Institute  to  lead  Program \nactivities under the knowledge and capacity-building function of the CAP. The institute will act \nas  a  center  of  excellence  for  the  region  and  (i)  introduce  international  best  practices,  (ii) \nundertake sector studies to determine possible areas of comparative advantage, and (iii) identify \nnew  market  opportunities.  The  institute  will  have  three  broad  roles:  (i)  to  lead  capacity-\ndevelopment efforts under CAREC;19 (ii) to develop a network of experts and researchers, and \ncoordinate research and analysis relevant to regional cooperation in CAREC countries;20 and (iii) \nto foster policy dialogue among and beyond the CAREC countries on key regional cooperation \nissues with a range of parties, including government officials, business leaders, and civil society. \n \n                                                 \n18 Fifth Ministerial Conference on CAREC. 2006. Urumqi Declaration. Urumqi. (outlined in para. 11).  \n19 These  will build on the Capacity  Development Program started under RETA 6375 (ADB. 2006. Technical \nAssistance for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation: Capacity Development for Regional Cooperation in \nCAREC Participating Countries, Phase I. Manila.) \n20 Specific research topics and studies will be developed in coordination with the SOM, sector committees, and the \nCAREC Institute work program. ", "  5\n3.  Information  Dissemination  and  Constituency  Building  for  Regional \nCooperation \n16.  The RETA will support seminars, workshops, and other outreach activities in CAREC \ncountries and outside the CAREC region to (i) expand awareness of the of the Program, (ii) \nraise awareness of developments and opportunities in the CAREC region among development \npartners and civil society, (iii) highlight the benefits of cooperation for CAREC countries, and (iv) \nimprove sharing of information and experience among countries and development partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The RETA is estimated to cost $5.2 million. ADB will finance $4.5 million of this amount \nfrom  its  TA  funding  program  and  will  also  administer  $500,000,  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China.21 The participating governments will provide the \nremaining $200,000, which is the estimated value of participating government logistical support \nfor meetings and staff time for activities conducted under the RETA. Detailed cost estimates are \nprovided in Appendix 2. Supplemental funding will be required to support a full program of \nactivities for the CAREC Institute. Such funds will be sought from interested development \npartners  and  used  to  finance  activities  not  adequately  covered  by  ADB  financing  and  to \nselectively expand existing activities with a focus on training and research. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The RETA will be implemented over 31 months from 1 September 2007 to 31 March \n2010. ADB will be the executing agency. ADB's CAREC Unit in the Country Coordination and \nRegional Cooperation Division of the Central and West Asia Department will be responsible for \noverall implementation of RETA activities.  \n \n19.  For  implementation  of  this  RETA,  approximately  22  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services will be engaged annually on an intermittent basis to assist with analytical \nworks and planning. Approximately 294 person-months of national consulting services will be \nrequired  annually    to  support  the  NFPs,  country  reporting  and  coordination,  knowledge \ndissemination, and technical support to the secretariat. The consultants will be engaged by ADB \non an individual basis in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). An outline of the terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \nEquipment budgeted under the RETA consists of a limited amount of computers and office \nequipment that will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) and left with the CAREC Unit upon completion of the RETA. \n \n20.  The outputs of the RETA will be disseminated at CAREC ministerial conferences, which \nreceive significant media coverage, and through the CAREC pages on the ADB website.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of the People's Republic of China; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $4,500,000  on  a  grant  basis,  for  Strengthening  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation, 2007\u20132009. \n                                                 \n21 Through the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nAccelerated regional  Average GDP growth in  ADB growth statistics for  \u2022  Continued engagement of \ncooperation in CAREC  CAREC countries in 2010- CAREC countries  participating countries in \nProgram participating  2014 of about 10%    the CAREC Program and \ncountries   (compared with base of  ADB poverty statistics for  commitment to greater \n  9.7% in 2002\u20132006)  CAREC countries  regional economic \n  cooperation \nA 10% reduction in   \npoverty incidencea (from \n\u2022  Successful completion of \n2006 base, or most recent  RETA 6347 and 6203b \navailable data) in each \n \nCAREC country by 2015 \n\u2022  Macroeconomic and \n \npolitical stability in CAREC \n  countries \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEffective functioning of the  Endorsement and  CAREC sector strategies for  \u2022  CAREC governments \nCAREC Program's overall  implementation of CAREC  transport, energy, and trade  endorsement and timely \ninstitutional framework   sector strategies in    implementation of sector \n  transport, energy, and  CAREC sector coordinating  strategies \ntrade  committee reports   \n    \u2022  CAREC governments \nAt least four regional  Senior officials\u2019 reports  identify and pursue projects \nprojects in transport,    in priority and second tier \nenergy, and trade  Ministerial conference  areas  \napproved in CAREC  statements   \ncountries in 2007\u20132010   \n  ADB loan and technical \nBroadening of the  assistance portfolio \nProgram through approval   \nof second tier projects as \noutlined in the \ncomprehensive action \nplan \n  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
