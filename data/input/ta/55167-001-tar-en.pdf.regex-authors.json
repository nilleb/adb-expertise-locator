INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the upgrading of the \ninstitutional capacity of the Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs (CEMA) and other government \nagencies in Viet Nam to implement the Master Plan on Socio-Economic Development of the \nEthnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas 2021\u20132030.1 More specifically, the TA will strengthen \nthe government\u2019s capacity to develop policies for implementing the master plan, identify livelihood \nopportunities  and  investments  benefiting  ethnic  minorities  and  marginalized  groups  in  the \nmountainous areas, and enhance coordination and systems to monitor strategic outcomes and \nprogress of the master plan. The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy \n2030 and will support the following operational priorities: addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities; gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment; tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; promoting \nrural development and food security; and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 It \nwill support Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 5, and 10.3 The TA is aligned with pillar 2 of the \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam,  2016\u20132020  on  increasing  inclusiveness  of \ninfrastructure and service delivery, with a focus on enhancing access to services and livelihood \nopportunities for ethnic minorities and the vulnerable groups in the mountainous areas.4 It is also \naligned with the upcoming country partnership strategy which will support inclusive green growth. \nThe TA is included in the country operations business plan for Viet Nam, 2021\u20132023.5 This TA \nwill also complement ADB\u2019s other support to ethnic minorities and help identify future business \nopportunities.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Persistently high poverty rate among ethnic minorities. Addressing socioeconomic \ndevelopment in ethnic minority areas has been a priority of the government for the past 3 decades \nstarting from 1990.7 Despite the government\u2019s efforts, the poverty rate among ethnic minorities \nreached its highest level in 2018 at 44.6%, even as the country experienced a decrease in its \noverall poverty rate to 9.8% in the same year from 58.1% in 1992.8 Ethnic minorities also \n \n1  Viet Nam National Assembly. 2019.

Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2021\u20132023. Manila. The former title of this TA in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2021\u20132023 is Livelihoods Improvement for Ethnic Minority People in Viet Nam. \n6  ADB is processing the Climate Resilient Inclusive Infrastructure for Ethnic Minorities Project in six provinces of \nCentral Viet Nam (Binh Dinh, Khanh Hoa, Phu Yen, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, and Quang Tri). The Government of \nViet Nam has requested ADB to process the Green Infrastructure for Ethnic Minorities Project in four northern \nprovinces (Lang Son, Son La, Thai Nguyen, and Yen Bai) for approval in 2023; The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 July 2021. \n7  According to an official report of the government to the National Assembly in 2019, the government has had at least \n128 policies and programs supporting ethnic minorities.  \n8  Viet Nam General Statistics Office. 2020. Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey 2018. Ha Noi. These poverty \nrates are based on the expenditure-based poverty line adopted by the World Bank in Viet Nam, which is consistent \nwith international standards of poverty lines. The government has adopted another multidimensional national poverty \nline based on income and other dimensions of access to public services for 2016\u20132020. Based on the government\u2019s \n \n \n ", "2 \naccounted for 72.9% of those living in poverty in 2018. In ethnic minority communities, females \nare more disadvantaged than males in terms of access to opportunities and resources because \nof social norms which tend to restrict their livelihood options and often limit them to domestic and \nchild-rearing activities. The intersection of discrimination based on both gender and ethnicity has \nthe most significant impact, compounding inequalities faced by ethnic minority women and girls. \n \n3.  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  address  poverty  among  ethnic  minorities.  The \ngovernment has issued various policies and investment programs supporting ethnic minorities, \nincluding  two  national  targeted  programs\u2014for  sustainable  poverty  reduction  and  for  rural \ndevelopment\u2014during 2015\u20132020 and two targeted poverty reduction programs\u2014the \u201c135\u201d and \n\u201c30A\u201d  programs\u2014for  the  most  disadvantaged  communes.9 Under  these  programs,  basic \neconomic and social infrastructure were developed for many ethnic minority communities. These \ninclude roads connecting ethnic minority communities to commune and district centers, domestic \nwater  supply  systems,  irrigation  schemes,  power  distribution,  schools,  health  centers,  and \nbroadcasting and telecommunications stations. However, there still remains a lot to be done or \nimproved, such as connection roads to district centers for at least 187 communes, concrete roads \nconnecting  to  commune  centers  for  about  9,500  communes,  irrigation  for  nearly  77%  of \nagricultural  land,  power  distribution  for  more  than  3,400  communities,  rehabilitation  of \napproximately 72,600 schools and 1,300 health centers, and construction of more than 7,000 \ncommunity centers (footnote 1). The government\u2019s approval of the Master Plan on Socio-\nEconomic Development of the Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas 2021\u20132030 confirms its \ncontinuous commitment to support ethnic minorities for the next 10 years (2021\u20132030). The \nmaster  plan  comprises  eight  groups  of  strategies  that  cover  all  key  aspects  to  ensure \nsocioeconomic development and to end poverty of ethnic minorities by 2030.10 The master plan \nis an all-in-one strategy of the government, and the most important one to date, to address poverty \namong ethnic minorities. Viet Nam has also developed a relatively progressive legal framework \non gender equality and women's empowerment which includes policies to promote gender \nequality in ethnic minority areas.11 \n \n \nnational poverty line, the overall poverty rate and the poverty rate of ethnic minorities were 6.8% and 28.5% in 2018 \nrespectively.  \n9  Government of Viet Nam. 1998. Decision No.135/1998/QD-TTg of July 31,1998 to Approve the Program on Socio-\nEconomic Development in Mountainous, Deep-Lying and Remote Communes with Special Difficulties. Ha Noi; and \nGovernment of Viet Nam. 2008. Resolution 30a/2008/NQ-CP on Support Program for Fast and Sustainable Poverty \nReduction in 61 Poor Districts. Ha Noi. \n10  The eight strategies are on (i) designing a national targeted program with 10 projects encompassing key aspects of \nethnic minority  socioeconomic  development,  including  land  planning  and clearance  for  safe  ethnic  minority \nresettlement and agriculture production, domestic water supply, infrastructure for agriculture and forestry production, \neducation, health, culture conservation, gender equality, and communication; (ii) developing investment prioritization \ncriteria for different ethnic minority groups and areas; (iii) promoting science and technology transfer supporting \nethnic minority communities, developing a comprehensive database on ethnic minority groups to inform, plan, \nmanage, and implement policies related to ethnic minorities; (iv) mobilizing funding resources (in addition to the state \nbudget) and promoting international cooperation to support the implementation of policies related to ethnic minorities; \n(v) developing institutional capacity of government agencies working on ethnic minority affairs; (vi) building individual \ncapacity, especially for government officials who belong to ethnic minority groups, and developing ethnic minority \nhuman resources for public sector management works; (vii) strengthening social security and national defense in \nethnic minority and mountainous areas; and (viii) improving policy credit programs to support ethnic minority \nlivelihood development.  \n11  Specific provisions are included in the Law on Gender Equality (Viet Nam Official Gazette. 2007. Law No. \n73/2006/QH11 on Gender Equality. Ha Noi), the National Strategy on Gender Equality for 2011\u20132020 (Government \nof Viet Nam. 2010. Decision 2351/QD-TTg approving National Strategy on Gender Equality for 2011\u20132020. Ha Noi), \nthe National Action Programme on Gender Equality for 2011\u20132015 (Government of Viet Nam. 2011. Decision No. \n1241/QD-TTg approving the National Action Programme on Gender Equality for 2011\u20132015. Hanoi), and 2016\u20132020 \n(Government of Viet Nam. 2015. Decision No. 1696/QD-TTg approving the National Action Programme on Gender \nEquality for 2016\u20132020. Ha Noi).    \n \n ", "3 \n4.  Limited institutional capacity for policy development. While the master plan reflects \nthe government's commitment to addressing chronic poverty by ensuring that future projects or \nprograms are more inclusive of ethnic minorities, its implementation is expected to be challenging \nbecause of limited capacity at different levels of the government to translate high-level strategies \ninto conducive policies addressing multidimensional poverty.12 Government officials working on \nethnic minority issues often lack the necessary skills and knowledge in policy design and \nimplementation, and pertinent analytical assessments. There is a shortage of in-depth studies on \ninvestment opportunities and business development approaches for ethnic minorities to support \nwell-structured visionary policies. \n \n5.  Limited institutional capacity for project identification and development. Support for \nethnic minorities has been provided through centrally managed national targeted programs, \nprovincially managed investment projects, and community-based projects. Few of them, however, \nhave  resulted  in  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  for  ethnic  minorities  because  of \nweaknesses in investment identification, prioritization, design, and implementation. It is therefore \nnecessary to build the capacity of government officials at the central, provincial, and local levels \nto identify and screen for projects with greater and more sustainable impacts on ethnic minorities. \nIt is important to involve all relevant stakeholders, including ethnic minority communities and the \nprivate sector, during project identification and development.   \n \n6.  Weak  coordination  and  monitoring.  Numerous  activities  on  socioeconomic \ndevelopment have been implemented by various government agencies, but these are often \nuncoordinated and not implemented effectively. At present, there is no mechanism in place that \nsystematically looks at the totality of the government\u2019s support for ethnic minorities to ensure that \nstrategic directions are followed and synergies are achieved. The eight strategies included in the \nmaster  plan  (footnote 9)  require  significant  coordination  efforts  from  the  government  and \ndevelopment partners to define specific interventions. Monitoring is often used more as an input \nreporting system rather than as a tool for decision-making and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: socioeconomic opportunities for ethnic \nminorities and marginalized people increased (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: \ninstitutional capacity of relevant government agencies to successfully implement the master plan \nstrengthened.13 More specifically, the government\u2019s capacity in making inclusive and conducive \npolicies, mobilizing and prioritizing resources to maximize intended impacts, and monitoring and \ncoordinating investments and activities supporting ethnic minorities for better results is expected \nto be improved. The government\u2019s strengthened institutional capacity will be measured by the \nincrease in investments for ethnic minorities by the public or private sector, with coordinated \nefforts by central and local governments, development partners, public and private investors, and \nother stakeholders. The TA will be delivered through the following three outputs.14 \n \n \n12  Government of Viet Nam. 2020. Report 249 of the Government to the National Assembly on the Proposal for \nInvestment Policy on a National Target Program on Socio-Economic Development of the Ethnic Minorities and \nMountainous Areas. Ha Noi. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 Deliverables generated under the TA will include training materials, modules, manuals, guidelines, and studies to be \nproduced as digital or printed publications. They will be provided to the CEMA and disseminated through the \ncoordination platform, CEMA and local government websites, and other media. \n \n ", "4 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Capacity to develop conducive policies for the implementation of the \nmaster plan improved. The TA will enhance the capacity of the CEMA and other government \nagencies to develop policies that will make the master plan operational. Studies will be undertaken \nto propose innovative solutions to improve the socioeconomic development of ethnic minorities \nand ensure inclusive growth, taking into full consideration cultural and heritage aspects. Review \nand dissemination of good practices and lessons learned from earlier development initiatives, \nincluding ADB\u2019s regional experience working with ethnic minorities through projects funded by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), will be incorporated to provide inputs to policy \ndialogue.15 Policy topics covered by the TA will comprise inclusive growth; human development; \ngender;  and  climate,  disaster,  and  pandemic  resilience.  The  TA  will  provide  training  for \ngovernment officials on themes such as policy analysis and review.16 The TA will also support \nknowledge-sharing events and workshops to facilitate policy dialogue between the CEMA, other \ngovernment  agencies  including  provincial  governments,  development  partners,  and  other \nstakeholders such as the private sector and civil society organizations representing ethnic \nminorities. Modalities of training and workshops will depend on the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19) pandemic situation. If a face-to-face modality is not feasible, virtual media will be used.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Capacity to identify and develop investment projects benefitting ethnic \nminorities strengthened. The TA will support the CEMA and provincial authorities to identify and \nscreen inclusive investment opportunities that will benefit ethnic minorities.17 These opportunities \nwill be either for public investments\u2014through loans and grants from ADB and other development \npartners\u2014or the private sector. Investment opportunities could include connectivity, agriculture \nproduction and value chain development, eco-tourism, climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable \nlivelihood enhancement, inclusive financial services, and service delivery improvement for ethnic \nminorities such as in education and health. More specifically, the TA will review existing national \nand provincial investment plans to identify investment gaps and priority areas to implement \nrecently approved policies supporting ethnic minorities. Scoping studies in priority areas will be \nprepared to seek investment opportunities that could bring inclusiveness and sustainability in the \ncontext of ethnic minorities.18 Consultation workshops on investment opportunities for potential \ninvestors in the public and private sectors will be held. Training for national and provincial \ngovernment officials on project development and management, social inclusion, participatory \napproaches, civil society engagement (for ethnic minorities, especially women), safeguards, \neconomic and financial analysis, and climate and disaster risk assessment will also be among the \nmain areas of support.  \n \n10.  Output 3: Capacity to monitor and coordinate the strategic outcomes and progress \nof the master plan improved. The TA will support the CEMA to put in place a monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) framework with identification of key indicators to monitor the main outcomes \nand implementation progress of the master plan. The M&E framework will be the basis for the \n \n15 ADB. 2002. Viet Nam: Indigenous Peoples/Ethnic Minorities and Poverty Reduction. Manila; ADB. 2005.

Strengthening Community-Driven Development in East Asia, \nSouth Asia, and the Pacific. Washington, DC. \n16 To ensure sustainability and institutionalization of training programs, the TA will support training of trainers, online \ntraining modules, and the development of a knowledge repository. \n17 Strategy (ii) of the eight strategies of the master plan (footnote 9). \n18 Scoping studies will include different analyses such as on economic and financial viability, environmental impacts, \nsocial and cultural issues, and climate risks and vulnerabilities to support the development of priority investment \nprojects supporting ethnic minorities. \n \n ", "5 \ngovernment to report to the National Assembly on the implementation of the master plan. The TA \nwill strengthen the capacity of the CEMA and other government agencies by providing training on \nM&E and analytical skills to produce evidence-based reports. The TA will also support the CEMA \nto lead stakeholder meetings and create a coordination platform to facilitate meaningful dialogue \nacross stakeholders.19 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,300,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the JFPR and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n12.  Vehicles,  salaries  for  civil  servants,  foreign  travel,  scholarships  or  long  internships, \ndetailed engineering design, civil works, and other related expenses are ineligible expenditure \nunder the JFPR.  \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff to work \nwith consultants, office space in Ha Noi and provinces, office supplies, secretarial assistance, \ndata and information for TA deliverables, vehicles for consultants\u2019 local land transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions as appropriate.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The CEMA will be the executing agency and ADB will administer the TA. The Southeast \nAsia Department\u2019s Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division and the Viet Nam \nResident Mission will supervise the overall implementation of the TA and work closely with the \nOfficial Development Assistance Projects Management Unit at the CEMA, other government \nagencies, and selected provinces. Individual consultants and resource persons will be recruited \nto provide international and national consulting inputs. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants and resource persons; organize workshops in cooperation with the CEMA and \nselected provinces; and procure essential office equipment for the TA central office.20  \n \n15.  Development partner coordination. Activities under the TA will be closely coordinated \nwith development partners that are working in ethnic minority areas, such as the Australian \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Irish Aid, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nthe United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, and others. In particular, ADB will \nensure the TA\u2019s complementarity to and synergy with (i) the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency's ongoing and planned support such as investment projects in the northern mountainous \nareas and provincial handbooks to facilitate private company investments prepared with the \nforeign investment agency; and (ii) Government of Japan\u2019s Grant Assistance for the Grass-Roots \nHuman Security Projects, which provides small grants to ethnic communities to improve their \nstandard of living through construction of clinics and schools and clearance of unexploded \n \n19 There are two working groups on ethnic minorities: the Ethnic Minority Working Group (EMWG) of development \npartners, and another EMWG of nongovernment organizations (NGOs). These platforms comprise only development \npartners and NGOs without the participation and contribution of the CEMA or other government agencies. The \ncoordination platform envisaged under the proposed TA will be for the government (with the CEMA in the leading \nrole) and development partners, NGOs, and other stakeholders including the private sector. This platform may be \nindependent of the current EMWGs or integrated with them. The proposed TA will explore the most efficient solution \nto ensure coordination and avoid overlap.  \n20 Essential office equipment may include photocopiers, computers, printers, and projectors. \n \n ", "6 \nordnance.
