I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Ningxia  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water \nConservation Demonstration Project.1 \n2.  The project will improve the value of horticultural crops by planting high-value and high-\nquality varieties, constructing water conservation infrastructure, promoting sustainable farming \npractices, and developing institutional capacity.2 The project will be implemented in Hongsipu \ndistrict, Tongxin and Yanchi counties, and six farms of the Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation \nGroup Co., Ltd. (NARC) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia).3 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Ningxia, located in the northwest region, is one of the PRC\u2019s ethnic minority regions, with \na total area of 66,400 square kilometers and a population of 6.2 million, of which 2.2 million \n(36%) are Hui minority. Ningxia is largely arid and semiarid, with dry and harsh winters and hot \nsummers. \n4.  Poverty. Ningxia lags the rest of the PRC in terms of income and well-being. In 2010, \nNingxia\u2019s per capita gross domestic product was CNY26,860, below the national average gross \ndomestic product of CNY29,762. A large income disparity also exists between urban and rural \nresidents in Ningxia, with the average urban income (CNY15,334) more than 3 times that of \nrural income (CNY4,675) in 2010. In 2011, more than 1 million people or about 25.6% of the \nregion\u2019s rural population were living below the national poverty line.4 One solution to reducing \npoverty and the gap between rural and urban income is to improve farming practices and crop \nquality to increase the incomes of crop growers in the agriculture sector. \n5.  Horticultural development. Agriculture remains an important sector in Ningxia. The \nvast plain of the Yellow River in the north has been irrigated for centuries. In the central arid and \nsemiarid areas where the project is located, extensive irrigation infrastructure has been built \nsince the 1960s. Several large lift irrigation schemes were built in the 1980s to divert water from \nthe Yellow River and transformed central Ningxia dryland farm areas into an irrigated agriculture \narea. Corn is the main grain crop in the project area. Since the late 1990s, the Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region government (NHARG) has been promoting the development of horticultural \ncrops to improve land and water productivity, and farmer incomes. Grapes and Chinese dates\u2014\ntwo of the major horticultural crops in the project area\u2014are promoted as priority, high-value, \nwater-efficient crops in NHARG\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. NHARG also has a 10-\nyear plan to develop 666,670 hectares (ha) of vineyards by 2020; NARC, a commercialized \nstate-owned enterprise, will play a key role in achieving this target.  \n6.  Since  the  late  1990s,  the  expansion  of  vineyards  in  Ningxia  has  been  rapid  and \nsignificant. This was achieved largely using low technology and poor vineyard management \npractices. Farmers\u2019 on-farm management skills for grapes are low. This starts with selecting \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.  \n3  The subproject locations are detailed in the Project Administration Manual, para. 20 (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  The government\u2019s official poverty line in 2011 was CNY2,300 per capita net income per year. ", "2 \nvarietals and designing the layout of each vineyard, and extends to managing the vines and \ncanopy  and  to  harvesting  practices.  More  training  and  extension  services  are  required  to \nimprove farmers\u2019 skills in vineyard management. \n7.  Chinese dates are the key cash crop for Tongxin and Yanchi counties. While local \nvarieties of dates can tolerate dry and low temperature conditions, the yield and quality of the \nexisting  date  orchards  are  mostly  low  because  of  continuous  drought  and  poor  on-farm \nmanagement. Date production will be improved by providing reliable irrigation and improved \nfarming technology and management. High-quality dates will earn farmers a higher price, and \nthus higher incomes. \n8.  Water use efficiency. The farming systems in Ningxia\u2019s arid and semiarid areas depend \non water availability. The project area is characterized by low precipitation, mostly late in the \ncropping season. Irrigation is essential during early crop-growing stages. Water resources are \nlimited, but flood irrigation is still practiced widely even for horticultural crops, resulting in low \nwater use efficiency. Improvement in water use efficiency by the agriculture sector is paramount \nfor  increasing  agricultural  productivity  and  crop  quality.  New  agricultural  land  can  be \nsubsequently developed as more water becomes available after water is saved from better \nirrigation efficiency. Controlled irrigation can also reduce water used by crops, improve crop \nquality, and reduce soil salinity. \n9.  Marketing and business strategy. NARC produces grapes through seven farms of a \nwholly owned subsidiary, Xixia King Industrial Co. Ltd., which runs its wine business through \nXixia King Winery. It is vital to NARC\u2019s business profitability that the two companies operate \nviable and sustainable vineyard and winery businesses. NARC\u2019s current production model lacks \nadvanced farming technology, resulting in inconsistent quality of grapes, and thus inconsistent \nwine quality. NARC would like to substantially reengineer the production model to improve the \nquality of its products. To ensure the effective implementation of the new production model, it \nalso needs a new quality system to monitor and review the production performance of its grapes \nand wines. \n10.  At present, NARC through Xixia King Winery sells about 80% of its wine production and \ncommands a 70% market share in wine sales in Ningxia; it has difficulty entering the wine \nmarket in other provinces. Even though wine consumption is increasing across the PRC, the \nnumber of wineries and wine brands is also increasing. NARC has not yet identified proper \nmarketing strategies to improve its competitiveness and profitability. The project will help NARC \nimprove  its  capacity  by  establishing  a quality  control  system,  developing  a marketing  and \nbusiness strategy, and providing training and consulting services. \n11.  Climate change impact. Vineyard and orchard production are particularly vulnerable to \nclimate change. Temperature increases, rainfall reduction, change in precipitation pattern and \nseasonal  duration,  and  higher  incidence  of  extreme  droughts  and  floods  are  affecting  the \nproductivity of vineyards and orchards in Ningxia. Weather reports show that (i) the average \ntemperature in Ningxia has risen by 0.8\u00b0C since 1960; and (ii) precipitation decreased by about \n8.6% from 1960 to 1990, with a recorded increase in drought events.  More efficient water use is \nrequired to adapt to climate change impacts. \n12.  Government and ADB strategy. The project is consistent with the Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan, 2011\u20132015 of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which aims to promote \nequitable and balanced regional growth, sustainable natural resource management, and crop \n ", "3 \ndiversification.5 The  project  particularly  follows  the  State  Council\u2019s  decree  on  promoting \neconomic and social development of Ningxia.6 The project supports NHARG\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan in accelerating agricultural development by increasing agricultural production capacity, \nreducing risk, and improving market competitiveness. Both grapes and dates are selected as \nhaving the potential to be transformed into high-value crops. The region\u2019s 10-year development \nplan for viticulture promotes innovation in irrigation technology and advocates the use of water-\nsaving irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler irrigation systems. The project is in line \nwith the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC, \nwhich supports the government\u2019s goal of building a harmonious society by (i) addressing rising \nincome  inequality  and  widening  regional  disparities,  and  (ii)  promoting  environmentally \nsustainable  development.7 It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  for \npromoting integrated water resources management and irrigation efficiency.8  \n13.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from programs and projects of the \nADB, the World Bank, and other development partners relating to land and natural resource \nmanagement  in  the  PRC.  The  PRC\u2013Global  Environment  Facility  Partnership  for  Land \nDegradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems,  which  is  administered  by  ADB,  helped  develop  an \nintegrated ecosystem management strategy and action plan for land management in Ningxia, \nwhich the project follows to improve the project design.9 The good practices being implemented \nunder ADB\u2019s ongoing Ningxia Integrated Ecosystem and Agricultural Development Project, such \nas  crop  residue  mulching,  minimum  tillage,  crop  rotation,  improved  pest  and  quality \nmanagement, and community participation, were also considered in the project design.10 The \nproject will use a partnership model of enterprise plus farmer household to improve the value \nchain;  this  was  tested  in  ADB\u2019s  earlier  agriculture  projects.11 A  project  component  will \nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the executing and implementing agencies to ensure \nproject success and sustainability.  \n14.  Demonstration  and  scale-up.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  improvement  of \nirrigation efficiency by using drip irrigation in the project vineyards and date orchards. Irrigation \nefficiency increase is critical to the sustainability of Ningxia\u2019s future agricultural development \ngiven its limited water resources. The project will help strengthen the partnership model of \nenterprises plus farmer households to promote sustainable farming practices and improve the \nagricultural value chain. The results and experiences from the project will be replicated in \nNHARG\u2019s agricultural development programs, particularly to develop 666,670 ha of vineyards \nby 2020. \n                                                \n5  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2011.

The \noutcome will be increased quality and value of horticultural crops in Ningxia. \nC.  Outputs \n16.  The project will have four outputs: (i) improved irrigation systems, (ii) improved vineyards \nand Chinese date orchards, (iii) increased grape processing capacity, and (iv) strengthened \ninstitutional and farmer capacity. \n17.  Output 1 will replace the existing irrigation systems with higher efficiency systems on the \nproject  sites,  and  introduce  drip  irrigation  and hose  irrigation  in the  project  vineyards  and \nChinese date orchards. It will support the construction of water storage ponds, small pumps, on-\nfarm water distribution pipe networks, and other relevant facilities. \n18.  Output 2 will support (i) the rehabilitation of 1,340 ha of existing vineyards and the \nestablishment of 1,260 ha of new vineyards in six farms of Xixia King Industrial Co. Ltd.; (ii) the \nestablishment  of  330  ha  of  vineyards  in  Hongsipu  district;  and  (iii)  the  establishment  and \nrehabilitation of 930 ha of irrigated Chinese date orchards in Tongxin and Yanchi counties.12 It \nwill also support associated land leveling; windbreak shelterbelts; improved farming practices, \nincluding pest management and balanced fertilizer application, and conservation tillage; and \naccess roads in the project vineyards and orchards.  \n19.  Output 3 will support Xixia King Winery in establishing about 15,000 tons of in-situ grape \nprocessing capacity and a quality monitoring system at each of the two NARC farm sites, with \n10,000 tons at the Yuquanying farm and 5,000 tons at the Nuanquan farm. This will include \ngrape crushing, pressing, and juice storage facilities. \n20.  Output  4  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies to implement the project and provide training to farmers on the use of drip irrigation \nand new farming technologies. About 5,000 farmers will be trained on grape and Chinese date \nplanting; improved vineyard and orchard technology and management; plant disease control \nand management; and other topics mostly through farmer field schools. It will help NARC to \nimprove  monitoring  systems  for  quality  control  and  enhance  its  marketing  and  business \nstrategy. It will also support development and strengthening of farmer associations, including \nwater users associations; pilot monitoring of water uses by water users associations; monitoring \nservices including soil testing; and support project management. About 18 person-months of \ninternational and 47 person-months of national consulting services will be provided for the \ntraining program and capacity development, including introduction of new technologies, and \napplied research and development. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $106.40 million (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates \nare in the project administration manual (PAM).13 \n22.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $70  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \n                                                \n12  Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding.  \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility;14 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.

Implementation Arrangements \n24.  NHARG, represented by the Ningxia Finance Department, will be the executing agency \nfor the project. A project leading group, headed by the vice chair of NHARG, will ensure \ncoordination across sectors and guide project preparation and implementation. A provincial \nproject management office (PPMO) has been established to be responsible for daily project \ncoordination of project preparation and implementation. NARC will be the implementing agency \nfor the activities under its jurisdiction, and the governments of the Hongsipu district, and Tongxin \nand Yanchi counties will be the implementing agencies for subprojects under their jurisdiction. \nThe implementing agencies will set up project implementing offices (PIOs) to carry out day-to-\nday  implementation  of their  subprojects,  procurement,  and  monitoring and  evaluation.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n25.  The  achievement  of  the  project\u2019s  impact  and  outcome  depends  on  the  successful \nintroduction  and  operation  of  drip  irrigation,  adoption  of  farming  technology,  and  on-farm \nmanagement. The engineering review indicates drip irrigation is relatively new to Ningxia, and a \nspecialized engineering firm needs to be engaged for detailed design, particularly to properly \ndeal with the high silt content in water from the Yellow River. A properly designed system with \nsilt  traps,  reservoirs,  filters,  system  maintenance  and  cleaning,  and  training  on  system \nmaintenance  are  necessary.  The  technical  assessment  suggests  that  farm  management \npractices are critical to the quality of produce. To improve grape quality, monitoring of vine and \nfruit growth through rigorous data collection and recordkeeping of vineyard operations, such as \nirrigation schedules, plant disease prevention measures, and pesticide application, are needed. \nThe project has allocated budget for the technical design, consulting services, and farmer \ntraining in these areas. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The economic analysis of the project used with- and without-project scenarios following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.16 The analysis confirms the economic \nviability of the project and each individual activity. The economic internal rate of return for the \noverall project is estimated at 17.4%, and for individual project activities from 12.1% to 23.8%. \nSensitivity analysis examined the robustness of economic viability of the project and individual \nactivities  under  three  scenarios:  benefit  decline,  capital  cost  increase,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance cost increase. While the economic viability of the whole project and most activities \nis quite robust, the date monoculture in Yanchi county and vineyard rehabilitation in NARC can \nbe  susceptible  to  a  substantial  benefit  shortfall,  and/or  a  substantial  capital  cost,  and/or \noperation and maintenance cost increase. The financial analysis assessed the financial internal \nrate of return for the whole project as 15.2% and for the individual project activities as 9.2%\u2013\n34.7%; all are well above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.77%. Hence, the project and \nthe individual project activities are confirmed financially viable. \nC.  Governance \n27.  The institutional and capacity development analysis found that NHARG has experience \nin  implementing  ADB-  and  other  development  partner-financed  projects.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment shows that (i) the executing and implementing agencies are capable \nof carrying out satisfactory accounting and financial reporting for the project, and (ii) internal \ncontrol and audit are generally acceptable. The procurement capacity assessment indicates that \n(i) established arrangements are in place in Ningxia to handle various stages of procurement, \n(ii) the  executing  and  implementing  agencies have  experience  in  undertaking  procurement \nunder  ADB-  or  domestically  financed  projects,  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  internal  controls \nregarding procurement are generally in place. NARC has adequate capacity and experience to \nimplement the project. However, the other three implementing agencies\u2014the governments of \nHongsipu district, and Tongxin and Yanchi counties\u2014have little experience with ADB projects. \nConsidering their limited experience, training on ADB procedures for financial management, \nprocurement, disbursement, and safeguards will be provided during implementation. \n                                                \n16 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  NHARG  and  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The  project  will  benefit  more  than  12,400  farmers  (about  3,200  households)  by \nincreasing  their  access  to  capacity  development  and  improved  agricultural  technologies  to \nstabilize their livelihoods and increase their incomes. In the project counties, the poverty rate is \nabove  35%\u2014much  higher  than  the  provincial  average  of  around  25.6%  and  the  national \naverage of around 10%. Among the project beneficiaries, 487 households with 2,289 members \nare recognized as rural poor households living under the national poverty line of CNY2,300. The \nbeneficiaries, particularly poor households with limited access to diversified income, will reap \nlong-term  benefits  from  higher,  more  predictable,  and  more  stable  agricultural  income  by \ngrowing higher-quality grapes or Chinese dates. The farmers will participate voluntarily and the \nsustainability  of  the  benefits  will  be  ensured  through  capacity  building  for  farmers  and \nempowerment of farmer associations. The farmers involved in grape production and Xixia King \nWinery will enter into production agreements before any planting activities begin and following \nan extensive consultation process. Community participation and social responsiveness of the \nproject activities are mainstreamed in the project design through consultation processes and \nincluded in the social action plan. \n30.  Gender. A gender analysis was carried out during project preparation. The project is \ncategorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  contains  design  features  to  support \nadvancing gender equality. The main gender issues in rural PRC and in the project area are \nunderrepresentation  of  women  in  decision  making;  women\u2019s  limited  access  to  capacity \ndevelopment  activities;  and,  thus,  reduced  opportunities  for  better  employment.  Women\u2019s \nworkloads are increasing because they remain on the farm, while many men and young people \ngo  elsewhere  for  better  job  opportunities.  The  gender  action  plan  identifies  activities, \nimplementation responsibilities,  and  expected  benefits from these  activities.17 The  plan  will \nbenefit  and  empower  women;  and  work  toward  gender  equality  by  (i)  improving  women\u2019s \nparticipation in decision-making processes, (ii) increasing capacity development for women, and \n(iii) increasing opportunities for employment. \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP) were prepared and \nare  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requirements.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination incorporates the results of the domestic environmental assessment \nreport approved in May 2012 by the Ningxia Environmental Protection Department. Adequate \nconsultations were conducted with key stakeholders, including local government agencies and \ncommunities. The conclusions and recommendations of the assessment were integrated in the \nproject  design.  NHARG,  through  the  PPMO  and  PIOs,  will  be  responsible  for  EMP \nimplementation, including monitoring, mitigation, reporting, and corrective actions or measures. \nThe PPMO and PIOs will have final responsibility for handling any disputes within the grievance \nredress mechanism. The institutional capacity of the implementing agencies to implement the \nEMP and ensure compliance  with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement is weak. A capacity \ndevelopment program is included in the project activities. \n                                                \n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n32.  The project is expected to achieve environmental benefits, specifically better water use \nefficiency  in  the  project  area;  and  soil  stabilization  and  reduced  erosion  resulting  from \nestablishment  of  shelterbelts.  No  major  adverse  impacts  were  identified.  Construction  and \nrehabilitation works are small and relatively simple. Operating risks include expanded use of \nagricultural chemicals, elevated chemicals in soils, and increased risk of workers\u2019 exposure of \nchemicals. Most project sites are located on modified lands used for agriculture and have been \ncleared of natural habitats.  No ecologically sensitive sites are present in the project area. \nWastewater from grape processing facilities will be treated and reused for crop irrigation, and \nwill not be discharged into channels leading to natural waterways. Shelterbelts established by \nthe project will utilize a mix of native and long-established tree and shrub species. Training \nprograms will include topics on safe application of agricultural chemicals and methods to reduce \napplication rates. Implementation of the EMP and the environmental monitoring program is \nexpected to prevent or minimize potential impacts. \n33.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category B for indigenous peoples. \nThe requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for safeguarding indigenous peoples \nwill apply to the project as (i) the Hui people have both distinctiveness and vulnerability as \ndescribed by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and (ii) the project will impact on their farming \npractices  and  may  consequently  alter  their  socioeconomic  status,  including  expenditure \npatterns,  though  principally  in  a  positive  way.  Among  the  project  beneficiaries  are  570 \nhouseholds,  with  almost  3,000  people  of  the  Hui  ethnic  minority,  concentrated  in  two \nparticipating villages. Poverty and vulnerability rates are higher for Hui households than for Han \nhouseholds. In terms of poverty incidence, more Hui households (32%) are considered low \nincome compared with Han households (16%). The higher poverty is in part due to former \nrelocation as part of a government program, but also to lack of access to improved farming \ntechniques. As potential project beneficiaries, concerns of ethnic minorities are addressed as \npart of the project design; and the executing and implementing agencies prepared an ethnic \nminority  development  plan  to  ensure  that  participating  minorities  will  receive  social  and \neconomic  benefits  that  are  culturally  appropriate  and  gender  responsive. The  plan  will  be \nfinalized once the production or participation agreements with farmers are finalized. \n34.  Resettlement. The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. No \ninvoluntary loss of land, housing, or access to income-generating assets is necessary for the \nproject. Most of the activities are going to be implemented on state farms with clear government \nland ownership. In the participating villages, construction activities will be limited to small-scale \ninfrastructure linked to improved irrigation, such as water retention ponds, irrigation pipes, and \nfarm  access  roads.  These  will  be  constructed  on  village  land  that  is  not  being  used  for \nagricultural or other income-generating activities, and ownership of the infrastructure will remain \nwith the villages. Participation and contribution of land to the planting schemes will be on a \nvoluntary basis; this will be formalized through the production or participation agreements and \nmonitored by the PIOs. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  The project has some potential technical, financial, implementation, and institutional \nrisks. The project provides adequate measures and/or assurances to minimize these risks, and \nthe  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.18 \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDrip irrigation systems do not  The implementing agencies will (i) recruit qualified and specialized \nwork to standards.  engineering firms for technical design of the drip irrigation systems,  \n(ii)  recruit  consultants  to  help  monitor  project  design  and \nimplementation, (iii) provide adequate training for farmers to operate \nand maintain the system, and (iv) empower water users associations \nto take over drip irrigation system operation and maintenance. \nGrape farmers fail to produce  NARC will contract international vineyard and other expertise to help \nhigh-quality grapes for the  improve  the  production  regime.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n36.  The government and NHARG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM (footnote 13) and loan documents. \n37.  The government  and  NHARG  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n38.  No withdrawals shall be made from the loan account until the onlending agreement \nbetween NHARG and NARC, in the form and substance satisfactory to ADB, shall have been \nduly executed and delivered; and shall have become fully effective and binding in accordance \nwith its terms provided in the loan and project agreements. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$70,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Ningxia Irrigated Agriculture and Water \nConservation Demonstration Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n22 November 2012 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  Percentage of land under water  NHARG and county  The government \nsustainability of  conservation irrigation, including  yearbooks, and  continues its efforts to \nagricultural  drip and sprinkler irrigation, to total  socioeconomic  promote sustainable \nproduction in  irrigated land increased from 50%  development plans and  development and \nNingxia  in 2010 to 80% by 2022  evaluation reports  increase farmer \nincomes. \nAverage per capita rural income  Project review missions, \nincreased from CNY4,675 in 2010  and completion and \nto CNY9,000 by 2022 in real terms  evaluation reports \nRatio of EBIT and revenue of the  Provincial review of the \nNARC vineyard and winery  progress of NHARG\u2019s \noperations (Xixia King Industrial  12th and 13th five-year \nCo.
