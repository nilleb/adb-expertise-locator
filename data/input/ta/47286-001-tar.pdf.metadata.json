Under Strategy 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is responding to climate \nchange as part of the broader agenda of promoting environmentally sustainable growth in Asia \nand the Pacific.1 ADB emphasizes enhanced access to climate finance as a means of helping \nADB  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  address  the  cost  of  implementing  low-carbon, \nclimate-resilient infrastructure. Actions to address climate change are priorities in a number of \ncountry partnership strategies (CPSs), and individual DMCs have made climate mitigation and \nadaptation an integral part of their national development strategies.2 ADB has been tracking \ndevelopments in international climate finance and is responsive to the requests of DMCs that \nseek enhanced access to these finance mechanisms.  \n \n2.  The proposed activities under the technical assistance (TA) will help build DMC capacity \nto access critical financing for scaling up climate change actions. The TA will help two to three \nADB DMCs develop the capacity to identify priority investment projects that mitigate climate \nchange and/or support adaptation to climate change while creating sustainable development co-\nbenefits. These priority investment projects may qualify for support through international climate \nfinance mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility, and other evolving mechanisms, \nsuch as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and financing for nationally appropriate mitigation \nactions, in addition to multilateral development bank financing and private sector finance. It will \nhelp DMCs to conceptualize financing strategies for these investments, and identify capacity \ngaps  and  barriers  that  impede  the  flow  of  climate  finance.3 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \n3.  The design of the proposed TA has been discussed informally with a range of DMC \nrepresentatives, bilaterally as well as at various regional and international forums. The TA \nconcept has also been discussed informally in the context of ADB involvement with the GCF, \nduring which a number of DMCs expressed interest in ADB assistance for identifying projects \nthat could access the GCF, and in enhancing DMC \u201creadiness\u201d for scaled up climate finance.5 \nADB  support to  enhance  DMC  readiness  has  also  been  highlighted in  conversations  with \npossible donor countries, including the Republic of Korea. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Given the need of DMCs to undertake massive additional investments to transition to a \nlow-carbon and climate-resilient development path on one hand, and the emergence of new \nclimate finance mechanisms such as the GCF (which is set to deliver a substantial amount of \nadditional  climate  finance  by  2020)  on  the  other,  ADB  will  face  increasing  demands  for \nassistance with regard to climate-related investment, including those supported by international  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  Of the 24 CPSs endorsed from 2009 to May 2013, all recognized climate change as a development issue, with \nsome emphasizing climate change as one of the key pillars or strategic priorities of their work with ADB. Climate \nchange interventions have also been mainstreamed in country operations to varying degrees in the CPSs. \n3  TA activities in DMCs will be initiated only after a no-objection letter has been obtained from the government. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 December 2013. \n5  Despite the lack of a definition of \u201creadiness,\u201d it is understood that climate finance readiness enhances the capacity \nof recipient countries to absorb financial resources (i.e., it builds absorptive capacity) and ensures that these \ncountries have the mechanisms in place to access international climate finance from a variety of sources.  \n ", "2  \nclimate finance.6 Aside from upgrading its own support to mitigation and adaptation initiatives in \nDMCs, ADB will be called on to help enhance DMC readiness for scaled up climate finance, \nincluding from multilateral, bilateral, and private sector sources. \n \n5.  Although all DMCs have different mechanisms, processes, and capacity in place that \ncan be built on, many will require targeted assistance to derive maximum benefit from the \nevolving  global  climate finance  architecture.  DMC  demands for TA,  including  to  ADB,  are \nexpected  to  increase  in  both  number  and  complexity  in  the  coming  years.  Demand  for \ninvestment  in  low-carbon,  climate-resilient  infrastructure  sectors  in  DMCs  by  multilateral, \nbilateral, and private sector climate finance sources will also grow. \n \n6.  DMCs  must  develop  strategic  approaches  to  engage  with  the  new  and  evolving \ninternational climate finance mechanisms. They must also help to increase investment in low-\ncarbon, climate-resilient infrastructure, including through the domestic private sector. Given the \nvolume  of  investment  needed  and  the  limitations  of  public  funds\u2014both  in  DMCs  and  in \ndeveloped donor countries\u2014the role of the private sector is crucial.   \n \n7.  Policy frameworks, institutional capacity, and technical skills must be strengthened at \nnational, subnational, and local levels for ADB DMCs to enhance their readiness for scaled up \nclimate finance and to improve their ability to plan, budget, deliver, and conduct monitoring, \nreporting, and verification of climate outcomes and climate finance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  increased  access  to  international  climate  finance  by \nselected DMCs. The outcome of the TA will be increased readiness of DMCs to access climate \nfinance for low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure projects.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) identification of opportunities for new and scaled up \nclimate finance operations; (ii) identification of priority infrastructure investment projects and \ncapacity  building  needs  in  selected  DMCs;  and  (iii)  enhanced  awareness  of  investment \nopportunities in low-carbon, climate resilient infrastructure.  \n \n10.  The TA will build on the experience of the Climate Investment Funds, which showed that \nDMCs require significant capacity building and institutional strengthening to access and absorb \nclimate finance effectively on a greater scale and over sustained periods. The TA is also \ndesigned to complement ADB initiatives under implementation, such as TA 8572, which aims to \nimprove South Asian DMC planning capacity to manage climate change.7 The proposed TA \ncould complement this TA by working closely in delivering common outputs such as resulting \n                                                \n6  A presentation given by the South Centre at the 2012 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(UNFCCC) meeting on long-term climate finance in Bonn, Germany estimated the financing requirements for \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation in developing countries to range from $600 billion to $1,550 billion per \nyear ($500 billion\u2013$1,100 billion for mitigation, and $100 billion\u2013$450 billion for adaptation).

These include aspects related to international \nclimate finance and mobilization of private sector investment. \n \n11.  Output  1:  Opportunities  for  new  and  scaled  up  climate  finance  operations \nidentified. A report containing the following will be produced: (i) an analysis of climate finance \nsources and mechanisms and an assessment of the resulting opportunities for new or scaled up \nclimate finance operations, with emphasis on opportunities in adaptation, and mobilizing the \nprivate sector; (ii) at least three conceptual proposals for ADB leadership and participation in \nlarge-scale, medium- to long-term low-carbon and/or climate-resilience investment programs\u2014\nthese could build on existing initiatives not yet taken to the scale needed to achieve the impact \nrequired  to  \u201cbend  the  emission  curve\u201d  (significantly  alter  the  trajectory  of  greenhouse  gas \nemissions) or be new concepts that could be pilot tested; (iii) minutes of a roundtable discussion \ninvolving key public and private sector actors on recommendations for advancing concepts with \nthe highest level of potential for mobilizing finance and generating climate impact at scale and \nspeed; and (iv) advice for building readiness for climate finance in DMCs. \n \n12.  Output 2: Priority infrastructure investment projects and capacity building needs \nidentified. For each of the targeted DMCs, a portfolio of two to three priority infrastructure \ninvestment projects with climate mitigation and/or adaptation benefits will be identified. The \nprojects will be selected on the basis of their impact, feasibility, and congruence with national \ndevelopment priorities; relevance to the ADB CPS; and likelihood of accessing international \nclimate finance and private sector finance. Based on a systematic assessment of DMC climate \nfinance readiness, the TA will produce a report describing (i) DMC opportunities and options for \nclimate  investment  based  on  DMC  needs,  priorities,  capacities,  and  climate  change  and \ndevelopment strategies and policies, with financial and technical support from development \npartners as well as the private sector; (ii) the experience and ability to engage with international \nsources of climate finance at national and subnational levels, including the identification of \nbarriers that prevent access to a greater volume of climate finance, and recommendations to \nenhance  participation  in  existing  and  emerging  climate  finance  mechanisms;  and  (iii)  the \ncapacity  to  plan  for  and  deliver  finance  in  conjunction  with  the  private  sector  and  other \nstakeholders. The report will also contain recommendations to improve climate finance delivery \nsystems and scale up private sector investment using public and international climate finance \nmechanisms. It will identify key gaps regarding in-country institutional or technical capacity to \ntrack finance flows, greenhouse gas  emission mitigation,  enhanced  climate resilience,  and \nrelated  co-benefits  for  sustainable  development;  and  analyze  how  these  gaps  may  be \novercome, including through financial and technical support from development partners. \n \n13.  Output 3: Awareness of investment opportunities in low-carbon, climate resilient \ninfrastructure enhanced. A national workshop will be organized in each of the targeted DMCs \nto present the results of the DMC studies produced under output 2 to DMC stakeholders from \nthe public and private sector, civil society, and development partners who would be instrumental \nfor implementation of the identified priority investment projects. A regional workshop at ADB will \nbe held to present the results of the DMC studies to representatives of other DMCs and \npotential financing and implementation partners. \n \n14.  The design of the TA is based on the assumption that the current high interest among \nDMCs to access a greater volume of climate finance through international finance mechanisms \nwill continue. Potential risks relate to (i) lack of commitment by developed countries to scale up \nbilateral climate finance quickly; and (ii) delays in the implementation of international climate \nfinance mechanisms such as the GCF, which would restrict the amount of available financing. \nRisks will be mitigated by (i) maintaining ADB involvement as an observer institution to the GCF; \n ", "4  \nand (ii) fostering communication with developed countries with regard to their bilateral climate \nfinance activities.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency, with the Climate Change Program Coordination Unit \nof  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  as  the  focal  point.  The  TA  is \nexpected to commence in January 2014 and will be completed in January 2016. An indicative \nimplementation schedule for activities is in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n  \n17.  Target DMCs will be proposed after discussions with regional departments, the Private \nSector  Operations  Department,  DMC  authorities,  and  other  stakeholders,  as  well  as \nconsultations with development partners and the GCF Secretariat.8 They will include at least \none Group A DMC9 and one small island DMC. The TA will target two to three DMCs. \n \n18.  The TA will finance consulting services, workshops, and report preparation. Consulting \nservices totaling 60 person-months (20 international and 40 national) will be required. The TA \nwill initially engage five consultants: (i) senior climate change specialist and team leader (13 \nperson-months, international); (ii) senior finance specialist (2 person-months, international); (iii) \nclimate change adaptation finance specialist (2 person-months, international); (iv) public policy \nand finance management specialist (3 person-months, international); and (v) regional project \ncoordinator (12 person-months, national). Additionally, the costs for services of climate policy \nand finance consultants (28 person-months, national) are also budgeted. The positions will be \nrecruited on a demand basis to respond flexibly to the outcome of discussions within ADB and \nwith DMCs and other stakeholders. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  Consultants will be engaged on an individual basis following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Individual consultant selection is \nproposed as the project is designed to respond to specific requests from regional departments \nfor advisory services and studies, which will be identified based on project selection criteria \nduring project implementation.  \n \n20.  Where possible, the TA will forge partnerships with regional centers of excellence in \nparticular to tap knowledge on barriers and opportunities for scaling up DMC climate finance \naccess.10 National  consultants  attached  to  regional  centers  of  excellence,  nongovernment \norganizations, or academe may be engaged under the TA.
