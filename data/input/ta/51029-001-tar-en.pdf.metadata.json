INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support Xiangyang in the \npreparation of strategic, sustainable transport and logistics plans to improve access and mobility \nfor passengers and freight both to and within Xiangyang over the short, medium, and long term. \nThe TA is included in the country operations business plan for the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC).1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Rapid economic growth and urbanization in the PRC have placed an enormous strain on \ntransport infrastructure and mobility in urban centers. Insufficient transport infrastructure capacity, \nfragmented transport systems, inadequate provision and use of public transport, and poor traffic \nmanagement have led to safety incidents, high emissions, inefficient land use, and a high cost of \ntransport and logistics. Furthermore, with the advent of high-speed rail and the innovation in \nsustainable and intelligent transport systems, geographic location alone is no longer a strategic \nadvantage for cities, and an efficient, green, multimodal transport system is needed to spur \nsustainable economic growth and development. \n \n3.  Xiangyang is in the center of the PRC and the second-largest metropolitan area in Hubei \nProvince, after Wuhan. It is known as a historic city with a rich cultural heritage. Its greater area \ncovers 19,727 square kilometers and includes Baokang County, Gucheng County, Laohekou City, \nNanzhang  County,  Yicheng  City,  and  Zaoyang  City;  the  built-up  urban  city  center  spans \n190.3 square kilometers. As of 2016, greater Xiangyang has 5.65 million inhabitants, of which \n1.45 million live in the city center; this number is forecast to grow to 1.7 million by 2020. In 2016, \n39.95 million tourists visited the area, 12.5% more than in 2015.2 \n \n4.  As a central city on the Han River and traversed by several tributaries, Xiangyang is an \nimportant part of the Yangtze River Economic Belt.3 It can be reached in 3 hours by road from \nfour major provincial capitals: Chongqing, Wuhan, Xi\u2019an, and Zhengzhou. Historically, this central \nlocation gave it a strategic advantage, but now Xiangyang must solve several transport challenges \nto keep attracting business, tourism, and industry, and spur economic growth. \n \n5.  Passenger road transport in 2014 was 4.7 billion kilometers (km), growing by 13% over \n4 years to 5.4 billion km in 2017. From 2013 to 2016, the number of private vehicles in Xiangyang \ngrew by 87%, from 135,500 to 252,800 vehicles, averaging 23% per year. Freight traffic in 2016 \nwas 52.5 billion metric ton-km, growing by 9% to 57.4 billion metric ton-km in 2017.4 These \nincreases are placing significant strain on Xiangyang\u2019s transport infrastructure and supporting \nsystems. \n \n6.  Road and rail river crossings in Xiangyang are already at capacity and are currently key \nbottlenecks of the transport system. Highway connectivity to the poorer southwest part of the city \nis particularly low, and the connection between downtown and Xiangyang Liui Airport, 18 km \nnortheast of the city, is inadequate. Water and air transport infrastructure is also inadequate to \n                                                \n1  The TA is listed as Hubei Xiangyang Integrated Sustainable Urban Transportation Planning and Strategic Study in \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: People's Republic of China, 2018\u20132020, \nManila. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 May 2018. \n2  Xiangyang Municipal Bureau of Statistics 2018. \n3  The Yangtze River Economic Belt covers nine provinces and two specifically administered cities within the Yangtze \nRiver Basin and contributes about 45% of the PRC\u2019s economic output. \n4  Xiangyang Municipal Transport Bureau 2018. \n ", "2 \nmeet current and future demand. These capacity constraints resulted in high transport costs, \nreducing the competitiveness of Xiangyang. The poor connectivity also led to uneven economic \ndevelopment, particularly in the poor mountainous areas. \n \n7.  Further, both passengers and freight heavily rely on road-based transportation, resulting \nin congestion, safety risks, and air pollution. The current modal split for freight transportation is of \nparticular concern\u2014while the national split in 2016 was about 77.6% road, 7.7% rail, 14.6% water, \nand 0.02% air transportation, the split in Xiangyang was about 91% road, 6% rail, and 3% water \ntransportation (footnote 4).  Although Xiangyang has 11 inland waterway port facilities, the \ninfrastructure is fragmented and outdated, so water transportation is underused. A redistribution \nof  freight  transport  from  roads  to  waterways  will  potentially  reduce  logistics  costs,  fuel \nconsumption,  air  emissions,  congestion,  and  road  accidents. 5  But  this  requires  more \ninfrastructure, better planning, and institutional strengthening. \n \n8.  Urban transport accounts for more than 30% of the city\u2019s total emissions because of its \nreliance on road transportation and the use of old technology, including high-emission buses and \ntrucks. Xiangyang\u2019s 92 bus lines transport 550,000\u2013600,000 passengers per day and cover the \ndowntown area, with the exception of Dongjin New Town. Although the public transport system \nhas improved greatly in recent years, its availability in the outlying zones of the city is poor, and \nthe vehicle fleets need to be modernized to reduce urban air pollution. The development of \nnonmotorized transport lanes, bus lanes, and urban rail systems is lagging that in other cities in \nthe PRC. Moreover, the lack of grade-separated, signalized pedestrian facilities results in high \npedestrian and vehicle interaction, interrupts the traffic flow on main roads, and endangers \npedestrians. \n \n9.  Plans to expand road, rail, air, and inland waterway transport in Xiangyang have been \nformulated, but their targets are insufficient to meet forecast demand. The logistics plan, in \nparticular, is out of date and inadequate even for current demand. These plans do not integrate \nphysical  infrastructure  development,  transport  communications,  and  systems.  The  lack  of \nintegration to date is in part related to the organizational structure and responsibilities of the \ntransport departments (the organization chart is accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 3). The fragmentation has led to inefficient allocation of resources, inefficient logistics, \npoor utilization of infrastructure and services, poor connectivity, and high transport costs; and is \nthus constraining economic growth. \n \n10.  The need to develop a more sustainable, modern, integrated transport and logistics \nsystem in Xiangyang is becoming increasingly urgent. Prioritizing public transport, encouraging \nenvironmentally  friendly  transport  technologies,  and  improving  information  sharing  and \ncoordination between different modes of transport to ensure seamless passenger and freight \ntransportation are crucial to improving environmental outcomes, and the overall efficiency of \ntransport and logistics systems. A transport plan that encompasses these elements and covers \nall modes of transport and logistics, as well as urban development trends, is required. \n \n11.  The Xiangyang Municipal Finance Bureau and Xiangyang Municipal Transport Bureau, \nincluding its logistics department, recognize the need for a cross-departmental, multimodal \napproach in formulating two strategic plans for Xiangyang\u2014(i) a high-level, comprehensive, \nintegrated, and sustainable transport plan to guide the development of a sustainable transport \nsystem; and (ii) a specific plan to modernize the logistics industry in Xiangyang so as to lower \ncosts and improve competitiveness and trade outcomes. Better transport and logistics outcomes \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016. Promoting Inland Waterway Transport in the People\u2019s Republic of China.

Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: modern, green, efficient, livable urban areas \nin  Xiangyang  developed.6 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  modern,  sustainable, \nintegrated transport and logistics system promoted. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Comprehensive, integrated, sustainable transport plan completed. The \nplan will provide a long-term vision for integrated, multimodal transport development in Xiangyang, \nincluding short-, medium-, and long-term actions that improve passenger and freight mobility.7 \nThe plan will take a user-centric approach to optimizing the mobility of people and the movement \nof goods. It will include a high-level sector analysis for each of the following: road, rail, air, \nwaterway, public transport, information systems, and logistics. This should include but not be \nlimited to (i) gap analysis of the existing transport infrastructure, systems, technology, and policies; \n(ii) plans to improve intermodal transport connectivity and information sharing; and (iii) the \ndevelopment of a prioritized project list, recommendations, and next steps specific to the needs \nand priorities of Xiangyang. \n \n14.  Output 2: Logistics improvement plan completed. A detailed analysis of the current \nlogistics industry in Xiangyang is needed to understand the underlying causes of the high cost of \nlogistics in the area, and to develop a plan to reduce these costs and improve logistics outcomes \nfor Xiangyang. The plan should include (i) a detailed understanding of the current situation, \nstakeholder needs, and future demand for the Xiangyang logistics industry, as well as an \nassessment of international best practice and lessons learned; (ii) a gap analysis of infrastructure, \nsystems, technology, and policies related to the Xiangyang logistics industry; (iii) plans to improve \nefficiency and reduce the cost of freight and logistics throughout Xiangyang; (iv) a Xiangyang-\nwide optimal layout for logistics facilities that identifies opportunities for logistics clustering and \nmultimodal  hub  development  based  on  industry  needs  as  well  as  transport  connectivity \nassessments;  (v)  implementation  and  operational  plans  for  integrated,  multimodal  logistics \nsystems, including policy recommendations; and (vi) the development of a prioritized project list \nand implementation plan specific to the needs and priorities of Xiangyang. The public and private \nsector will be consulted throughout the strategy development. \n15.  Output  3:  Multimodal  integration  and  logistics  capacity  strengthened.  The \nmultimodal integration and logistics capacity of the Xiangyang Municipal Transport Bureau needs \nstrengthening to support the operation and development of an effective, multimodal transport and \nlogistics industry in Xiangyang. In particular, the transport bureau staff have identified the need to \ndevelop  a  deeper  understanding  of  inland  waterway  transportation,  logistics  clustering, \nmultimodal logistics hubs, and how to use information technology to more effectively share \n                                                \n6  Government of the PRC, Xiangyang Municipal Government. 2016.

Capacity \nstrengthening should therefore cover infrastructure, technology, and policy development. This will \nenable effective implementation of the transport and logistics plans, and help improve cooperation \nand integration throughout the Xiangyang transport and logistics industry. In addition to training \nactivities, a study tour of an operational multimodal transport and logistics facility in the PRC would \ndemonstrate first-hand the efficiencies that can be gained through multimodal integration. \n \nC.
