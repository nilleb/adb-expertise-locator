INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program  member \ncountries are committed to a shared vision for the region\u2019s energy sector to ensure (i) energy \nsecurity through the balanced development of the region\u2019s energy resources, infrastructure, \nand institutions; (ii) stronger integration of the region\u2019s energy markets to enable all Central \nAsians to have access to adequate volumes of reliable, affordable, financially sustainable, and \nenvironmentally sound commercial energy; and (iii) economic growth through energy trade. \n \n2.  The Strategy and Work Plan (2016\u20132020) for Regional Cooperation in the Energy Sector \nof CAREC Countries aims to promote new technologies and remove market barriers in the \nregion.1 As  a first  step,  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  organized  technology-training \nprograms  in  2015  to  increase  the  awareness  of  global  energy  trends  and  recent  energy \ninnovations among key decision makers and opinion leaders from CAREC countries. With the \nawareness  of  recent  innovations,  senior  officials  representing  CAREC\u2019s  Energy  Sector \nCoordinating Committee agreed on a new technology vision for pilot projects using readily \navailable equipment in developed countries, especially lithium-ion batteries and solar power. \nFive Energy Sector Coordinating Committee member countries\u2014Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nMongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan\u2014were convinced on the use of new technology in an off-grid \nsolar setting to increase or maintain reliable electricity access in their countries, and requested \nADB to finance regional technical assistance (TA) to demonstrate a direct current (DC) solar \nelectrification kit. The plug-and-play solar kit will include solar panels, lithium-ion batteries, \nenergy-efficient lights, fans, a small refrigerator, a mobile phone charger, and a television, with \nsome form of universal connectors and pre-cut cables for easy connection and setup. This solar \nkit is not readily available in the global market. \n \n3.  The TA will develop a technology adoption road map for off-grid areas in the CAREC \ncountries. The Renewable Energy Development TA2 for Afghanistan will pilot test and support \nthe proof of concept (allocation of $30,000) to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a 12-volt \nDC solar kit, which can be easily assembled with little training. The design and complete \ntechnical specifications of the kit will be developed for the proof of concept, which will also \nidentify the appliances that can be used with the kit. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  More than 700 million people in Asia and the Pacific have no access to electricity, and a \nlarge number of them are in two CAREC member countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan. People \nin the remote mountainous areas of other CAREC countries also have poor access to reliable \nelectricity. People rely on kerosene lamps for lights, when they have no access to electricity. An \nInternational Finance Corporation study notes that about 144 million people have no access to \nreliable  electricity  in  Pakistan  alone  and that  people  spend  about $2.3  billion  annually  on \ncandles, kerosene lamps, and battery-powered flashlights. Kerosene lamps cost up to 30 times \nmore than the inefficient incandescent bulb and 100 times more than compact fluorescent and \nlight-emitting diode (LED) lamps. In some poor households, kerosene costs may account for up \nto 25% of their family\u2019s monthly income, and people in off-grid areas often travel to electrified \ntowns to charge their phones for a fee. Further, kerosene lamps release black carbon into the \nenvironment, pollute the air inside homes, and cause lung and eye diseases. They produce \ninsufficient light for work or study and their naked flame causes many accidents and injuries. \n                                                \n1  CAREC. 2015. Strategy and Work Plan (2016\u20132020) for Regional Cooperation in the Energy Sector of CAREC \nCountries. Ulaanbaatar. \n2  ADB. 2014. Afghanistan: Renewable Energy Development. http://www.adb.org/projects/47266-001/main. \n ", " 2 \n5.  Small (30\u201350 watt) off-grid solar lighting systems are a popular alternative to kerosene \nlamps. About 4.5 million households and 25.0 million people in Bangladesh3 have replaced \nkerosene lamps with small solar home lighting systems, and about 35.0 million people in Africa \nhave basic lighting under the Lighting Africa Program of the World Bank. In Pakistan, the Buksh \nFoundation initiated the Lighting a Million Lives Project4 to provide solar energy access to rural, \nunelectrified villages in the country and plans to bring electric lights to 4,000 villages and about \n1 million people by 2017. The small systems only provide lighting.  \n \n6.  Beyond lighting, modern life requires the use of mobile phone chargers, a mechanical \nfan,  a television,  and a  small refrigerator. In  off-grid  areas,  these  appliances  can  only  be \noperated with either electricity generated by diesel generators or a larger off-grid solar system \nwith lead acid batteries. Both of these options are expensive and are beyond the reach of the \naverage household in rural areas. Diesel generation is an electrocution risk and requires expert \nknowledge, a large fuel inventory for reliable supply, and technical knowledge to manage the \ngeneration set; a lead acid battery-based system requires battery replacement every 1\u20133 years. \n \n7.  Recent technological advances and price reductions in three areas\u2014lithium-ion batteries, \nsolar  power,  and  energy-efficient  appliances\u2014have  made  larger  off-grid  solar  systems \neconomically  more  viable  than  extending  the  main  transmission  and  distribution  networks, \nespecially in the case of expensive diesel generation-supplied grids. With this new technology, \nmillions of people may be able to stop using kerosene lamps and start producing their own \nelectricity, leapfrogging the long wait for connection to the electricity grid. As larger solar panels \nhave become cheaper and suppliers of lithium-ion batteries are ready to provide more than \n5 years of guarantee, it is possible to design a system that can power lights, a television, and a \nsmall refrigerator; and charge mobile phones for off-grid communities.  \n \n8.  Off-grid solar approach may soon be the preferred choice over grid-connected electricity, \neven in countries with 100% electrification. For example, a typical new connection in rural \nAfghanistan is estimated to cost about $1,2005 (plus regular payments for energy consumed), \ncompared  with  a  $1,500  kit  that  includes  power  generation  and  basic  appliances  with  no \nadditional payment other than basic maintenance for 5 years. According to a recent World Bank \nreport,6 the market for off-grid electricity will be about $3.1 billion by 2020, reaching about 100 \nmillion households. This is leading to a huge paradigm shift: off-grid electrification and micro-\ngrids may no longer be a stopgap measure and may even be the least-cost option in many \ndeveloping countries. \n \n9.  The TA aims to demonstrate the technical and financial viability of this new technology \ncombination in the CAREC region, and enable the off-grid community to move from basic \nlighting to a range of basic battery-operated appliances using larger solar panels and long-life \nlithium-ion batteries. This is consistent with other ADB investments that allow off-grid solutions \nas a long-term technology option on the least-cost optimization plan. \n \n10.  The development challenge is to create a market for low-voltage DC appliances, quality \nbatteries, and reliable solar panels in CAREC countries at reasonable prices. Solar panels \n                                                \n3  Z.  Shahan.  2016.  ~25  Million  People  Benefit  from  Home  Solar  in  Bangladesh.

While  DC  appliances  are  affordable  and  easily \navailable in developing countries and online stores, mainly for use during camping and other \nrecreational activities, they are not readily available in CAREC countries. In some cases, high-\npriced but low-quality products are on the market\u2014a key barrier to mainstreaming off-grid \nelectrification to be viable for scale-up. In addition, other universal barriers, such as high up-\nfront costs, lack of financing and awareness, institutional barriers, and perceived risks, will be \nassessed during implementation and scale-up. \n \n11.  The project will promote DC off-grid solar kits and equipment by demonstrating the \nviability  of  this  technology,  developing  knowledge  materials,  and  building  capacities  for \nmainstreaming this initiative. By establishing a market and creating new demand, ultimately \nthrough retail competition, the overall price of the kit will be lower. Off-grid electrification will \nmitigate climate change by reducing black carbon, and bring significant health and development \nbenefits by replacing kerosene lamps. By using lithium-ion batteries, the system will be safer \nand healthier than kerosene, produce brighter lights, extend product lives, and lower life cycle \ncosts. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project impact will be increased access to reliable, affordable, financially sustainable, \nand environmentally sound energy using new technology. This is aligned with the CAREC \nEnergy  Strategy  and  Work  Plan,  2016\u20132020  (footnote  1).  The  outcome  will  be  off-grid \nelectrification in CAREC countries mainstreamed, with at least one off-grid electrification project \nincluded in the country operations business plan pipeline for CAREC countries by 2018. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will deliver three outputs through the following key activities: \n(i)  Viability  of  large-scale  off-grid  direct  current  solar  kits  adoption \ndemonstrated  in  selected  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \ncountries. Participants of a focus group discussion and pilot users accept off-\ngrid solutions as a permanent alternative to grid-connected electricity, both in \nterms of price and service levels. The project will install 100 operational off-grid \nsolar kits in five CAREC member countries. A technical expert panel (TEP) will \ncomplete the design of the solar kit, finalize the technical specifications of the kit \ncomponents, and establish acceptable warranty levels. With a consulting firm, \nthe TEP will also identify the main equipment suppliers, procure components, \nestablish the implementation arrangements, distribute the solar kits, and develop \na technology adoption road map. \n(ii)  Open-source  design  available  for  developing  new  business  by  private \nsector. A communications coordinator will be engaged to help the TEP and the \nconsulting  firm  develop  a  website  for  open-source  design  where  off-grid \nelectrification project designs can be published. Together, they will test the social \nacceptability of off-grid and DC technology, organize an open-source design \ncommunity, and prepare and launch social media plans. \n(iii)  Off-grid electrification capacity developed. The consulting firm will develop a \ndata collection framework to assess the financial and technical viability of the \n ", " 4 \nsolar kits. It will also provide training on the framework and on managing the \ninstallation of the solar kits. \n \n14.  The TA will take the proof of concept to the pilot phase and will (i) test for technical, \nfinancial, and economic viability; (ii) develop financial models and plans for scale-up; (iii) design \ncash  flow  models  and  policy  needs  plans  for  local  industry  development;  (iv)  establish \nacceptable warranty levels and detailed technical specifications of kit components; (v) develop a \nbranding and communication strategy; and (vi) analyze the target beneficiaries\u2019 willingness to \npay and the social acceptability through consumer surveys and focus group studies. \n \n15.  After the pilot phase, and based on consumer acceptability and technical results, the \nproject will identify areas within Afghanistan and Pakistan that may use this technology to \nincrease access to electricity by 30,000 to 50,000 households for a scale-up project and local \nmarket development. Once technical viability is demonstrated and a market price for the kit is \nestablished, an option to develop a basic kit (lighting only) and a full kit (lighting plus other \nappliances) will be market-tested with consumer focus groups. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.   The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nClean Energy Fund7 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by \nADB. The participating governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA and will work closely with the Department of \nEnergy (or its equivalent), power utilities, and interested civil society organizations in each of the \npilot countries: Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Details of this \narrangement will be developed during the inception mission. The TA will be implemented over \n24 months starting from September 2016 to October 2018. \n \n18.  ADB will oversee and lead the implementation of the TA, and will work closely with \nCAREC coordinators in ADB resident missions in the pilot countries. The Energy Division of \nADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department and its team of consultants will organize internal \nseminars and workshops that will include other ADB staff members as resource persons. ADB \nwill engage all consulting services following its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). \n \n19.  ADB will recruit up to four individual technical experts (one as the consultant team leader) \nand an international consulting firm to manage the design and implementation of the off-grid \nsolar kits. ADB will recruit 12 person-months of international individual experts to design the \ntechnical specifications of the off-grid kit, its packaging, and component selection criteria based \non the preliminary proof-of-concept work. Once the technical and innovative specification of the \ndesign is complete, the consulting firm will distribute, monitor, and report the performance of the \npilot project in the five selected countries. The firm will deliver 24 person-months of international \nand 60 person-months of national consulting services, and will be selected through ADB\u2019s \nquality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 ratio and using a simplified technical \nproposal. \n                                                \n7  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n ", "5  \n20.  Technical expert panel. The four key technology elements\u2014solar power, DC supply, \nstorage, and DC appliances\u2014have seen dramatic technological development in the past 24 \nmonths, requiring technical experts to have fresh perspectives and recent research or academic \nachievements. Recent technical experience gained from technical institutions with established \ncredentials in the four technology elements will have more bearing in selecting the individual \nexperts that will be recruited under this TA. \n \n21.  ADB  may  establish  partnerships  with  renowned  technology  service  providers  or \nuniversities. The guiding principles for any partnership will include the following: \n(i)  TA proceeds will not finance the staff costs, capitalization, or ordinary operating \nexpenses  of  partner(s),  and  will  only  finance  the  eligible  individual\u2019s \ntransportation and daily subsistence allowance. \n(ii)  Partner(s)  will  not  engage  consultant(s)  or  resource  person(s)  using  the  TA \nproceeds. All consultants and/or resource persons to be financed by ADB using \nthe proceeds for the assignments envisaged and/or proposed in the partnership \nagreement will be engaged directly by ADB. \n(iii)  The off-grid training will be conducted in partnership with Hydro Tasmania, a \nutility-owned  by  the  Government  of  Australia.  This  will  cover  visits  to  solar \ninstallations that are wind and fly-wheel installations (as energy storage) in the \nKing Island Renewable Energy Integration Project and Flinders Island Hybrid \nEnergy Hub.8 \n(iv)  The project team will continue its work to establish partnerships with large battery \nproviders and companies like Tesla, which makes the AC-based Powerwall. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  and  Contracts  Administration  Unit  will  purchase  batteries,  solar \npanels, controllers, DC appliances, and other types of equipment. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nfor Access to Electricity with New Off-Grid Solar Technology in Central Asia, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n8  These projects are financed by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.
