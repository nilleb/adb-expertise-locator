INTRODUCTION\n1. In December 1999,1 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved financing of $400,000\nfor  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  study  on  financial  management  and  governance  in  seven\nselected developing member countries (DMCs). The scope of the study involved the diagnostic\nreview of the existing accounting and auditing support and standards available in the seven\nDMCs, and the formulation of action plans to rectify the identified gaps and weaknesses of\nthese support and standards when compared with those of international best practices. The\nDMCs covered by the TA were Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Mongolia, Pakistan,\nPapua New Guinea, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. TA activities commenced in April 2000 with the\nselection and mobilization of two international consultants. By February 2001, all individual\ncountry reports and an overall summary report were complete. The reports have been widely\ndisseminated  to  interested  groups  in  participating  DMCs,  international  organizations,  and\nmultilateral and bilateral institutions.\n2. Given the success of the phase one study, the TA Screening Committee endorsed a\nsecond phase of the TA2 to cover another set of four DMCs. As discussed and agreed with the\ntwo programs departments and the Office of Pacific Operations, the DMCs to be covered under\nthe second phase will include the Kyrgyz Republic, Marshall Islands, Sri Lanka, and another\ncountry from the South Pacific subregion to be determined.3 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. To avoid another massive financial crisis in the region, as in 1997, and the Russia\nFederation crisis of 1998, the need for sound financial management and governance continues\nto  be  highlighted  by  international  assistance  groups,  including  ADB.  As  an  important\ncomplement to this call, ADB, the International Monetary Fund, and World Bank are all heavily\nengaged  in  activities  leading  to  improved  financial  systems  in  their  member  countries.\nImprovements leading to sound national economic and financial policies must be based on\ninternational best practices that are less prone to crises. The implementation of internationally\naccepted standards in areas relevant to the effective functioning of the DMCs\u2019 financial systems\nis a critical element to strengthening the global economic system in the wake of the earlier\ncrisis. Strengthening of the financial infrastructure also complements ADB\u2019s work relating to\ngood governance, combating corruption, and performance-based lending.\n4. The release of the eight international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS), in\nMay 2000, underscores another aspect of financial management advocated by the international\ncommunity. Although the project of developing the IPSAS was spearheaded by the Public\nSector  Committee  of  the  International  Federation  of  Accountants,  the  project  was  in  fact\nsupported  by  three  funding  agencies,  namely  ADB,4  the  United  Nations  Development\n                  \n1  TA 5877-REG: Strengthening Financial Management and Governance in Selected DMCs, for $400,000, approved\non 14 December 1999.  The TA is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2001\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in January 2001.  At the request of several\ndepartments, the Phase II TA is being renamed to describe more precisely the TA activities.\n3   With the assistance of the Financial Sector and Industry Division (East), a similar study is also being conducted for\nthe Philippines as a part of TA 5765: Banking, Capital Markets and International Competitiveness Reforms in\nResponse to the Currency Turmoil.  The Pacific subregion as a whole, comprising Cook Islands, Fiji Islands,\nSamoa, and Tonga, may be studied using the University of South Pacific and the Fiji Institute of Accountants as a\nfocus for accountancy training and development.\n4  TA 5748-REG: Government Accounting Standards, for $245,000, approved on 27 August 1997.", "2\nProgramme, and the World Bank. Six additional exposure drafts were recently published with\nrequests for comments. The IPSAS are applicable to all levels of government and are intended\nto provide governments around the world with a platform on which to base improvements of\ntheir financial management and reporting practices.\n5. The phase one TA identified gaps and weaknesses in the available accounting and\nauditing support in seven DMCs. The country workshops, held in each participating DMC,\npresented an opportunity for discussion of the diagnostic review and assessments of the study.\nRepresentatives  of  the  accounting  training  and  education  sector,  public  and  private\npractitioners, and professional organization participated. Issues and concerns were debated,\nwhile proposed actions to rectify the situation were broadly agreed upon, and an appropriate\naction plan developed for each participating DMC.\n6. The international conference, held in Manila on 16-18 October 2000, disseminated the\nphase one findings to a much larger group that included representatives from the seven DMCs,\nsupreme  audit  institutions,  professional  accounting  and  auditing  organizations,  international\nfunding agencies, and other interest groups. Representatives from the DMCs expressed their\nwillingness to cooperate and support multilateral development banks and other assistance\nagencies in their institutional strengthening and capacity building efforts that are to lead to more\ntransparency and accountability, reduced corruption, and enhanced public confidence. During\nthe conference, the participation of several senior ADB staff exhibited ADB\u2019s commitment to the\nexercise and future activities that may result.\n7. Positive feedback has been received, both external and internal, on the findings and\ndiscussions pertaining to the study during the conference. The findings revealed the underlying\nweaknesses in the DMCs. Most countries share the identified issues. These regional issues\ninclude (i) the lack of skilled accounting and auditing personnel, particularly in the public sector\ngiven the relatively lower pay scales compared with the private sector; (ii) constraints in the\nprovision of accounting education and training; (iii) competency of accounting lecturers and\nprofessors, who require updating in the latest international best practices; and (iv) lack of\navailable accounting textbooks in local languages. The DMCs urgently need assistance to\nimprove  the  current  situation  and  lead  to  enhanced  financial  management  capability.  The\nfindings of the first phase are being incorporated into the respective DMCs\u2019 country strategy and\nprogram (CSP). The findings will be used for policy dialogue to enhance financial governance\nand  to  develop  assistance  programs  to  strengthen  financial  management  practices  in  the\nDMCs.  As an example, the CSP for Viet Nam includes TA to strengthen financial management\npractices.\n8. Prior to the phase one study, the development community agreed that because this\ncountry-by-country assessment and diagnostic task is enormous, it must be undertaken as a\njoint  effort.  The  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  (CFAA)  program,  the  TA\u2019s\ncounterpart, is a continuing activity of the World Bank.5 ADB was asked to be an equal partner\nand take an active role in this activity. In April 2000, ADB\u2019s lead financial specialist assisted a\nWorld Bank mission in conducting the CFAA for Indonesia. World Bank officials participated in\nADB\u2019s  TA  activities  in  Viet  Nam.6  Similar  joint  exercises,  involving  other  DMCs,  will  be\nconducted,  not  to  duplicate  efforts,  but  to  maximize  the  use  of  scarce  resources  of  both\ninstitutions.\n                  \n5  The World Bank\u2019s CFAA program has a broader scope and covers such issues as procurement practices,\ninsolvency laws, and legal issues.\n6  The World Bank\u2019s CFAA for Viet Nam will be issued as Volume II of the ADB\u2019s report for TA 5877 (footnote 1).", "3\n9. To enhance the sustainability of phase one and expand the coverage of the study, the\nsame diagnostic review will be conducted in another set of DMCs. The pragmatic way forward\nthat started the process in a limited way should expand coverage of the DMCs progressively in\nthe coming year (footnote 1). Hence, under the proposed TA, ADB will assess the situation in\nanother set of four DMCs that are not covered by other development agencies and for which\nprofiles are not currently available from other sources. In selecting the four DMCs, consideration\nhas been given to (i) the previous and current activities of other assistance agencies (to avoid\nduplication of effort); (ii) the extent of ADB\u2019s projects and programs; (iii) the commitment of the\ngovernment  and  other  relevant  agencies  and  organizations  to  implement  the  proposed\nimprovement in their accounting and auditing support; and (iv) geographic location to achieve\ndiversity.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n10. The TA will carry out a diagnostic review of the existing accounting and auditing support\nand standards available in the selected DMCs. The TA will then assess the need for assistance\nto improve the current situation.7 The objectives of the TA are to (i) assess the capability and\ncapacity  within  a  selected  DMC  to  provide  efficient  and  effective  accounting  and  auditing\nsupport  to  meet  international  standards  and  best  practices;  (ii)  determine  the  existing\naccounting and auditing standards of the selected DMCs; (iii) assess the degree of deviation\nfrom  the  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and  IPSAS,  while  identifying\nweaknesses  and  possible  options;  (iv)  introduce  the  concept  of  international  standards  in\nworkshops; and (v) determine the level and type of assistance needed by the selected DMCs to\nprovide acceptable accounting and auditing support to  the private and public sectors.\nB.  Scope\n11. The TA will involve an in-depth study of the key issues relating to accounting and\nauditing  support  in  the  selected  DMCs,  identify  gaps  and  weaknesses  that  need  to  be\naddressed to improve accounting and auditing support, and develop assistance programs in\ncollaboration with other assistance agencies to rectify the identified weaknesses with a view to\nimproving current support for accounting and auditing. All assessments under the TA will be\ndone in close coordination with broader governance assessments. The TA findings will be used\nwhen  developing  the  respective  DMCs\u2019  CSP,  as  appropriate,  to  ensure  that  the  identified\nweaknesses are addressed over time by ADB and other assistance agencies.\n12. The TA will be organized into three parts.\n13. Country  Case  Studies  on  Available  Accounting  and  Auditing  Support  and\nStructure. This part will examine the current accounting and auditing structure and systems\nadopted in the selected DMCs in the public and private sectors. It will also (i) analyze the\npolitical, institutional, regulatory, and legal framework on accounting and auditing practice of\neach selected country and the level of enforcement of existing laws, rules, and regulations; (ii)\nidentify gaps and weaknesses in accounting and auditing support available, and deviations from\ninternational standards; and (iii) identify alternative options to remedy the identified weaknesses,\n                  \n7  To ensure complementarity, this assessment will take into account all ongoing activities of ADB and other\nassistance agencies.", "4\nwith the objective of eventually doing away with these. The study findings on the current\nsituation in each selected DMC will provide a valuable reference for use of ADB staff and\nconsultants in their operational work.\n14. Conduct of Workshops.  This part will disseminate the findings of the country research\nthrough in-country workshops. Each workshop will provide a cross-section of views on the\nresearch findings and establish ways to move forward to improve financial management and\ngovernance in the country. An awareness program on the IAAS will be given through the\nworkshops.  Representatives  of  government  agencies,  professional  bodies,  educational\ninstitutions,  assistance  agencies,  and  other  interest  groups  will  be  invited  to  attend  the\nworkshops.\n15. Formulation of an Action Plan.  The third part will assess the roles that ADB and other\nfunding agencies can play in improving the current situation in the selected DMCs. The roles\ncould  include  policy  intervention,  projects  and  program  assistance,  and  mobilization  of\ncofinancing resources to address the identified problems and weaknesses. This activity will be\nundertaken in close consultation with the governments, regulatory authorities, representatives of\nthe accounting and auditing professions, and other local interest groups and funding agencies.\nAt this stage of the TA, the commitment, in principle, of the selected DMCs to implement the\nfindings and recommendations of the study will be sought. Finally, the TA findings will be\ndisseminated and debated at a conference in Manila to which interested groups will be invited.\nAt this conference, an action plan, covering both activities requiring external assistance as well\nas  actions  to  be  undertaken  without  external  assistance,  will  be  finalized  for  progressive\nimplementation.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The estimated cost of the TA is $230,000 (Appendix 2). The study will be financed by\nADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n17. An international consultant specializing in multisectoral accounting and auditing practice\nwill be engaged for six person-months to conduct individual country studies for the four selected\ncountries and to prepare country reports. The consultant, who will be provided with competent\nlocal technical support under the TA budget at ADB headquarters, will prepare an issues paper,\nand the consolidated report integrating the findings and implications of the individual country\nreports. The consultant\u2019s contract will also have a provision to have local research assistants to\nhelp with data collection. The consultant will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants. The consultant will be engaged on an individual basis and will work\nunder  the  supervision  of  the  lead  financial  specialist  in  the  Economics  and  Development\nResource  Center.  The  study  will  be  supervised  and  coordinated  by  Economics  and\nDevelopment Resource Center,  working closely with staff of ADB\u2019s programs departments, the\nOffice of the Pacific Operations, Central Operations Services Office, Controller\u2019s Department,\nOffice of the General Auditor, Strategy and Policy Department, and other relevant departments\nand individuals. In the respective DMCs, the consultant will work in close coordination with the\nrelevant government authorities and the accounting and auditing professions. The outline terms\nof reference for the consultant are in Appendix 3.\n18. The TA will commence in April 2001 and conclude in November 2001. The workshops\nwill be held progressively during the course of TA implementation and a final conference will be", "5\nheld in Manila in October 2001. The findings of the workshops and conference will be compiled\nfor dissemination within ADB, the participating DMCs, and the development community. ADB\nstaff will participate in the workshops and conference as resource persons to ensure that ADB\u2019s\ncommitment to improving financial management and governance is adequately reflected.\nIV.

The consultant will work under the supervision of the lead financial specialist (Economics\nand Development Resource Center) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with relevant ADB\nstaff, and with the accounting and auditing professional organizations (where they exist) of the\nselected DMCs, as well as the DMCs\u2019 governments and their regulatory authorities.\n3. The terms of reference of the consultant will include the following:\n(i)  Carry out a detailed review of the accounting and auditing practices followed in\nthe selected DMCs in both the public and private sectors. Identify deficiencies in\nthe current system and assess how these may be best rectified. In this process,\ntake care not to duplicate work of other organizations and other ongoing activities\nof ADB. Build on earlier work carried out either by assistance agencies or other\nprofessional organizations to facilitate the most comprehensive understanding of\nthe accounting and auditing situation in the country. The assessment should\ninclude  regulatory  constraints  and  impediments,  the  availability  of  qualified\nhuman resources, local training facilities for accountants and auditors, availability\nof  data,  extent  of  the  use  of  information  technology,  the  existence  of  local\naccounting and auditing standards, and the extent to which these differ from the\nIAAS.
