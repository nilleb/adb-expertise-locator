INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Transport  Sector  Coordination Wing  of  the \nPlanning Commission. ADB approved the TA concept paper on 9 September 2009. In October \n2009, an ADB fact-finding mission held discussions with the Planning Commission and the \nEconomic  Relations  Division  to  prepare  the  TA.  It  reached  an  understanding  with  the \ngovernment on the TA impact, outcome, scope, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  transport  system  of  Bangladesh,  catering  to  domestic  and  international  traffic, \ncomprises roads, railways, inland waterways, two seaports, maritime shipping, and civil aviation. \nPresently the country has about 271,000 kilometers (km) of roads, including about 21,000 km of \nmajor roads. It also has 2,706 route-km of railways; 3,800 km of perennial waterways, which \nincrease to 6,000 km during the monsoon; the ports of Chittagong and Mongla; two international \nairports (Chittagong and Dhaka); and eight domestic airports. Major improvements have been \nmade  for  roads;  ports,  especially  in  Chittagong;  and  civil  aviation.  The  length  of  railways \nremains  unchanged from  what  was  inherited of  the  British  Indian  Railway  system. It  is  a \ndisjointed network separated by the Jamuna River with two separate and incompatible gauges. \nThe length of navigable waterways has decreased from about 8,000 km in 1970 partly due to \ninadequate dredging. \n \n3.  Three transport-related ministries implement subsector investment plans and policies \nwith their implementing agencies. The Ministry of Communication is responsible for railways \nthrough  Bangladesh  Railways  and  for  major  highways  through  the  Roads  and  Highway \nDepartment.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development,  and  Cooperatives  is \nresponsible for the rural road network through the Local Government Engineering Department. \nUrban roads are under city corporations. The Ministry of Shipping is responsible for inland \nwaterways, ports, and shipping. Under the ministry, the Chittagong Port Authority manages the \nChittagong  seaport  and  the  Mongla  Port  Authority  manages  the  Mongla  seaport;  the \nBangladesh Inland Waters Transport Authority manages ports on inland water systems; and the \nLand  Port  Authority  manages  land  ports.  The  Planning  Commission  is  responsible  for \ncoordinating investment planning and main policies. \n \n4.  The public sector provides most of the rail and port services. In recent years, however, \nprivate sector involvement has increased considerably in road and inland water transport and \nocean shipping. It is also gradually entering the domestic air transport and passenger rail \nmarkets as well as transport logistics. Geography limits the inland waterway system. Many \nrivers do not have high-capacity bridges; reliance on ferries results in the use of small trucks for \nboth intra-  and  interurban distribution  services.  Rail and  road  services are  constrained  by \nnetwork capacity and poor quality of infrastructure. Inadequate maintenance has led to severe \ndeterioration of even major road and rail sections. Cost recovery of all modes is low due to \nnumerous regulations and subsidies. Asset replacement, in particular for railways, is infrequent \nand unplanned. Thus, service quality is low and unit costs of transport are high and rising. \n \n5.  Of the transport sector spending, which is the largest development expenditure in the \ncountry, most recent data indicates that roads received 80% of the transport budget, inland \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 October 2009. \n ", "2   \nwater transport 18%, and railways 2%. The funding allocated to roads was mostly used for \nmajor corridors and secondary roads. With very little expansion and renewal investment, railway \nand inland waterway infrastructure and services have degraded, resulting in decreased demand. \nFrom 1975 to 2005 the modal share of road transport rose from 54% to 88% for passenger \ntraffic, and from 35% to 80% for freight; while the overall annual traffic growth rate in the past 10 \nyears has been nearly 8.2% for freight transport and 8.4% for passenger transport. \n \n6.  The government approved the National Land Transport Policy (NLTP) in April 2004. The \npolicy introduced the concept of long-term network planning and integration of transport policy, \nplanning, and appraisal across land transport modes. Based on the NLTP, the draft integrated \nmultimodal transport policy emphasizes more rational and balanced investments, and better \ncoordination across transport modes. Under the NLTP, the Transport Sector Coordination Wing \n(TSCW) was established in 2004 within the Planning Commission to coordinate with ministries \nsuch as communications, shipping, civil aviation, and tourism; and local government division, in \nrelation  to  their  activities  for  long-term  planning,  investment  analysis,  monitoring  and \ncoordination of policy implementation, and transport studies. \n \n7.  Each subsector undertakes physical and institutional improvements in line with a long-\nterm policy provided in the NLTP together with subsector master plans. Major subsector issues \ninclude (i) maintenance financing, quality, safety, and overloading of major roads; (ii) better \nplanning in rural roads; (iii) restructuring of Bangladesh Railways into a commercially oriented \norganization  in  conjunction  with  substantial  investment  in  infrastructure,  rolling  stock  and \nwagons, equipment, and technical modernization; (iv) efficient dredging and tariff regulation for \ninland waterways; and (v) operating efficiency improvements in ports. As indicated in the NLTP, \nenvironmental consideration is needed in project assessment to help mitigate climate change. \nThe road master plan is complete. The railway program for institutional reform is ongoing under \nthe framework of the ADB Railway Sector Investment Program2 in parallel with the government \nrailway development plan containing investment proposals for the next 20 years. The Inland \nWaterway Transport Sector Policy has been approved in principle and work on the master plan \nis being finalized. Operating efficiency of the Chittagong Port has improved through ADB loan \nand  TA  to  enhance  physical  and  institutional  elements.  Another  TA  is  currently  under \npreparation to develop an overall framework for port and logistics efficiency improvement in the \ncountry.   \n \n8.  While solving constraints by mode, an optimal multimodal mix needs to be pursued at \nthe  same  time  to  ensure  efficiency  of  economic  activities  and  energy  consumption,  with \nenvironmental  considerations  and  resource  constraints.  For  the  long  term,  the  optimal \nmultimodal mix should help mitigate climate change. Inadequate coordination among transport \nsubsectors  and  intermodal  connectivity  are  among  the  principal  issues  constraining \nimprovement in mobility, accessibility, safety, service reliability, and productivity; as well as \nefficient investment to the transport sector.  \n \n9.  The government needs a system for coordinating development plans, projects, and \nbudgets  under  the  current  institutional  framework  so  that  it  can  prioritize  investments  by \nallocating limited resources among subsectors to maximize development impacts of the overall \ntransport  sector  investment.  Support  to  coordination  among  transport  subsectors  is  a  key \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2006.

TSCW is assessed to \nrequire capacity building support to ensure its functions are sustainable. This includes specialist \nservices, especially for transport planning and project evaluation for multimodal considerations. \nCapacity development is also required for sustainable implementation and monitoring of long-\nterm plans, especially for the draft integrated multimodal transport policy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  transport \ninfrastructure investment through multimodal coordination and long-term project planning. This \nwill enhance Bangladesh\u2019s competitiveness in export and import markets through increased \nproductivity of transport systems. \n \n11.  The TA will enhance TSCW capacity for interministerial and agency coordination and \nlong-term integrated development of the transport sector. It will improve the quality of transport \ninvestment proposals including incorporation of long-term and multimodal aspects in project \ndevelopment  and  reduce  time  spent  by  the  Planning  Commission  considering  transport \ninvestment proposals. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will deliver (i) systems linking long-term plans to project development from the \nperspective  of  long-term  and  multimodal  planning,  and  (ii)  enhanced  project  appraisal \nframeworks in selected subsectors. The TA\u2019s fundamental methodology is to facilitate transport \nsector planning using a multimodal coordination perspective by enhancing the knowledge and \nskills of TSCW. The TA will enhance TSCW capacity through technical advice and on-the-job \ntraining  in  developing  and  implementing  (i)  a  coordination  mechanism  among  subsector \nministries  and  agencies,  (ii)  long-term  planning  and  implementation  monitoring  in  each \nsubsector, and (iii) improved investment analysis and associated technical studies including \ndevelopment of a geographic information system database. \n \n(i)  On-the-job training. The TA-financed consultant will help TSCW with planning and \ncoordination  activities  through  on-the-job  training  and  advice  on  (a)  developing \ncoordination procedures and mechanisms among subsector ministries and agencies, \n(b)  implementing  transport  policy,  (c)  developing  systems  for  monitoring  policy \nimplementation,  (d)  reviewing  and  updating  master  plans  as  required,  and  \n(e) enhancing project appraisal frameworks. \n \n(ii)  Workshops and training. To sustain the capacity building efforts, workshops and \ntraining will be organized. Interministerial workshops will facilitate the exchange of \ninformation and experience among various government officials. International best \npractices  and  their  effective  application  in  local  contexts  can  be  shared  and \ndeveloped. Short-term international training will be explored as required. \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program: Bangladesh, 2006\u20132010.

The consultant will undertake the required surveys in coordination with \nrelevant ministries and agencies, especially those requiring improved techniques and \nskills.  This  may  include  assessment  of  traffic  and  capacity,  and  methods  of \nmeasuring key performance indicators. The consultant may prepare a brief manual \nof such surveys and methods so that TSCW will be able to undertake surveys and \nassessment in the future. Initially, the simplest and most suitable methods will be \nrecommended to TSCW for undertaking such surveys with optimal use of resources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $625,000 equivalent; ADB will provide \n$500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-IV). The government\u2019s counterpart in-kind contribution will be $125,000 \nequivalent  in the  form of  office  accommodation, support  facilities,  counterpart  staff,  maps, \nreports, and other logistical support. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Planning Division of the Ministry of Planning will be the executing agency and \nTSCW  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The  Planning  Division  will  facilitate  senior \ninterministerial coordination, secure the budget, and monitor the delivery and expenditure of the \nTA.  The  head  of  TSCW,  the  implementing  agency,  will  be  appointed  project  director  to \nsupervise  day-to-day  TA  activities,  and  report  to  the  Planning  Division  and  the  steering \ncommittee. A steering committee, chaired by the member, Physical Infrastructure Division, of \nthe Planning Commission, with representation from subsector ministries and agencies, will be \nestablished  to  provide  overall  guidance  on  TA  delivery.  To  ensure  quality  delivery  to  the \nsatisfaction of the Planning Commission, specific details of deliverables include (i) guidelines \nand  manuals  for  coordination  procedures  and  mechanisms,  and  policy  implementation;  \n(ii) monitoring systems; and (iii) enhanced project appraisal frameworks in selected subsectors.  \n \n15.
