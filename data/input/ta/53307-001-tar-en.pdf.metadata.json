The Rural Finance Development Project will expand access to finance for rural cottage \nand small industries (CSIs). In addition, the project will improve the institutional capacity of Bhutan \nDevelopment Bank (BDB) by supporting the implementation of a comprehensive institutional \nstrengthening plan, including enhanced systems for CSI outreach. Finally, the project will enhance \nthe capacity of rural CSIs to access financing by providing business development support and \nfinancial literacy training with gender inclusive outreach targets. \n \n2.  The proposed project\u2019s outcome is finance sector\u2019s rural financing capacity enhanced. The \nproject is aligned with the following impact: productive and gainful rural employment opportunities \ngenerated.1 The project has four outputs: (i) collateral-based rural CSI financing expanded, (ii) \nnon-collateral-based rural CSI financing expanded, (iii) BDB\u2019s institutional capacity strengthened, \nand (iv) financial literacy training and business development support extended to rural CSIs. The \nproject will be financed with a $20 million loan from the concessional ordinary capital resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Although Bhutan\u2019s economy grew steadily during 2010\u20132018, averaging 6.02% annual \nGDP growth, the economy is still largely rural and agriculture-based, and there is significant \neconomic disparity between urban and rural areas. 2 In rural areas, opportunities for  both on-farm \nand off-farm employment are extremely limited and farmers mostly depend on subsistence \nproduction of crops and livestock.3 To generate productive rural employment opportunities, the \nGovernment  of  Bhutan  recognizes  CSIs  as  an  economic  driver  that  can  positively  impact \nemployment,  income  generation,  and  poverty  reduction,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The \ngovernment\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 emphasizes, among others, reducing poverty \nand inequality, creating productive and gainful employment, and promoting gender equality \n(footnote 1). The Twelfth Five Year Plan especially focuses on creating income-generating \nopportunities for vulnerable populations and enhancing the rural economy by promoting CSIs. \n \n4.  In Bhutan, CSIs constitute more than 90% of total enterprises and employ about 99,288 \npeople, with 22,064 registered CSIs in 2019.4 However, despite the government support, CSIs \nhave poor access to finance and face constraints related to labor regulations, taxation, and \nregistration requirements. Access to finance is by far the largest constraint.5 CSIs generally lack \nthe capacity to develop business proposals, which are needed to qualify for financing from formal \nfinancial institutions. Most CSIs lack the financial literacy to confidently apply for loans from formal \n \n1  Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2019.

A World Bank enterprise survey in Bhutan \nin 2015 found that 23.8% of small- and medium-sized enterprises identified access to finance as the largest obstacle, \nfollowed by labor regulation (22.6%) and high tax rates (12.1%).

", "2   \nfinancial institutions.6 Men- and women-owned CSIs face similar challenges; however, these \nchallenges are often greater for women, who suffer from low literacy and lack of confidence. \nAccess to finance is particularly scarce for rural CSIs because of the limited presence of formal \nfinancial institutions in rural areas.7  \n \n5.  BDB is the key rural finance institution in Bhutan. It provides most CSI loans, as other \ncommercial banks tend to focus on urban and corporate clients, lack business expertise in serving \nCSIs and rural communities, and have stringent collateral requirements for CSIs. \n \n6.  BDB\u2019s  key  function  is  to  provide  financial  services  to  agricultural,  commercial,  and \nindustrial enterprises, especially CSIs. However, despite its mandate, BDB\u2019s outreach to rural \nCSIs  has  been  moderate  because  of  its  weak  operational  and  financial  performance  and \ninsufficient financial literacy training, business development support and other forms of social \nmobilization to its clients.8 To expand rural CSI financing, BDB will need to, among others, (i) \nimprove its overall financial and operational performance; (ii)  direct its strategic focus and \nbusiness orientation more toward rural and agriculture financing; (iii) make its policies, products, \nand business processes suitable for the rural, agriculture, and CSI market; and (iv) develop the \ncapacity of its staff, especially credit officers on rural, agriculture, and CSI financing. In addition, \nBDB needs to enhance its nonfinancial services to reach rural CSIs. \n \n7.  The technical assistance (TA) will improve BDB\u2019s financial and operational performance \nand develop BDB\u2019s capacity to significantly expand rural CSI financing outreach. The TA outputs, \nwhich will support the achievement of the project\u2019s outputs, are (i) BDB\u2019s institutional capacity \nstrengthened, and (ii) financial literacy training and business development support extended to \nrural CSIs. The TA is included in the Country Operations Business Plan for Bhutan, 2021\u20132023.9 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.
