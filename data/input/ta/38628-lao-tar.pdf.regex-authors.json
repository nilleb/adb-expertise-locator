During Asian Development Bank (ADB) operational missions in 2005, the Government of \nthe  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  requested  assistance  for  preparing  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Northern Power Transmission Project. The project aims to \nsupport  GMS  members\u2019  strategies  for  promoting  regional  power  exchange  and to  electrify \nnorthern rural Lao PDR. The project will develop and strengthen power interconnections with \nThailand and extend the existing transmission lines and distribution facilities in northern Lao \nPDR. A project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the project was included in the 2006\u2013\n2008  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  update  for  the  GMS.1 The  ADB  Project \nPreparatory TA Fact-Finding Mission visited the Lao PDR and Thailand from 23 to 31 March \n2006, and reached an understanding with the Government on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing, and terms of reference.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Expansion of high-medium-voltage power transmission lines, and rural electrification are \ncrucial for development. Only 47% of households have access to electricity\u2014one of the lowest \nrates in Southeast Asia. The country has no integrated national grid, since the existing high-\nvoltage transmission lines were developed mainly to enable exporting of electricity from Lao \nPDR hydropower projects and to provide electricity to Vientiane Municipality. Outside the grid, \nrural households and communities have to rely on expensive off-grid power supply, or have no \nelectricity. Expensive energy hinders rural development and worsens the rural\u2013urban income \ngap. For sustainable and regionally balanced growth, the Government intends to electrify up to \n90% of total households by 2020 mainly through grid extensions.2  \n \n3.    The Government accords top priority to electrification of the northern provinces. Only \n16.1% of households are electrified in Bokeo, Luangnamtha, and Phongsaly provinces\u2014a rate \nmuch lower than the national average. The northern provinces are among the poorest in the Lao \nPDR, as over 58% of their households are poor, compared with 4.4% in Vientiane Municipality.3 \nTo eradicate poverty and promote sustainable economic growth, the Government\u2019s priority is to \nprovide basic infrastructure, and has called for ADB\u2019s assistance to focus on these provinces.4 \nOne  priority  measure  to  promote  sustainable  development  is  to  increase  electrification  by \nextending transmission lines.  \n \n4.   The Government is keen to support regional cooperation in the power sector. The Lao \nPDR has about 18,000 megawatts (MW) of hydropower potential, of which only 690 MW have \nbeen harnessed. The Government intends to develop export-oriented power projects to earn \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Manila (Loan 1749-LAO). ", " 2   \nforeign exchange. Despite this hydropower potential, the Lao PDR depends on power from \nneighboring countries. For example, in the border areas, which are isolated from the power grid, \nthe Lao PDR imports electricity at medium voltage from neighboring countries. For the northern \nThai\u2013Lao PDR border areas, the Lao PDR receives limited power through 22-kilovolt (kV) lines \nfrom the Provincial Electricity Authority of Thailand at Houayxay (Bokeo province) and Kenthao \n(Xayaboury province). The Lao PDR and Thailand have exchanged power for more than 30 \nyears since the commissioning of the Nam Ngum 1 hydropower project (155 MW) in 1971, and \nhave a good long-term relationship. \n \n5.   The state-owned Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) intends to supply electricity to the northern \nrural areas to achieve the Government\u2019s electrification ratio target. EdL is responsible for power \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution to meet national demand. EdL\u2019s power facilities cover \nthe northern, central 1, central 2, and southern regions, serving about 457,000 customers. For \nthe power transmission in central 1, including Vientiane Municipality, ADB has helped EdL \nconstruct a backbone high-voltage (115 kV) transmission network.5 ADB has helped construct \n115  kV  transmission  lines  from  Vientiane  to  Luangprabang  connecting  to  Nam  Ngum  1 \nhydropower and Nam Leuk hydropower (60 MW). ADB\u2019s ongoing project will extend the 115 kV \npower grids from Luangprabang to reach Luangnamtha in the north. \n  \n6.  In line with Government policy, the project identifies 115 kV transmission lines extending \nacross the northern provinces of Bokeo, Luangnamtha, Phongsaly, Oudomxay, Xayaburi, and \nVientiane. The project also includes five new substations (115 kV/22 kV), and medium- and low-\nvoltage  distribution  facilities  for  rural  electrification.  The  project  also  upgrades  the \ninterconnection  to  Thailand  from  22  kV  to  115  kV  transmission  lines.  Through  the \ninterconnections, the Lao PDR will import power from Thailand to serve the northern region in \nthe short term, but the two countries expect to exchange power when the hydropower projects \nby independent power producers are completed. The power trade through interconnections will \nprovide  significant  economic  and  environmental  benefits  for  each  country  and  the  entire \nsubregion. Such trade will enable countries to (i) reduce national investments in the power \nreserves to meet peak demand, (ii) provide a more reliable supply of electricity in case of power \nfailure, (iii) reduce operational costs, (iv) reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, \nand (v) increase consumers\u2019 access to the least-cost power supply. The proposed project is an \nintegral part of the national power development plan to supply electricity to northern Lao PDR \nand complements the GMS program to promote power trading through interconnection with \nneighboring countries.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The project\u2019s impact is to provide more reliable and environmentally sustainable power \nsupply to northern Lao PDR and northeastern Thailand. The TA\u2019s outcome will be a feasibility \nstudy and project design agreed to by ADB and the Government. The study will set out a project \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998.

An initial poverty and social analysis for the \nproject is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA activities will identify a project suitable for funding under an ADB loan. The TA \nscope  will  cover  115  kV  transmission  lines  (731  km)  in  northern  Lao  PDR,  comprising \n(i) Houayxay  (Lao  PDR\u2013Thai  border)\u2013Luangnamtha  (146  km),  Namo\u2013Boun  Neua  (96  km); \n(ii) Kenthao (Lao PDR\u2013Thai border)\u2013Paklay\u2013Hongsa (219 km), Nonhai\u2013Paklay (104 km); and \n(iii) Hongsa\u2013Nam Beng\u2013Houayxay (136 km), five substations (Houayxay, Boun Neua, Namo, \nHongsa, and Paklay), and erection of medium- (22 kV) and low-voltage (400 V) distribution \nfacilities. Activities will include (i) reviewing all studies relating to power system development in \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand;  (ii)  assessing  electricity  demand  in  northern  Lao  PDR;  (iii) \nconducting the optimal power system expansion simulation, applying least-cost methods; (iv) \ncarrying out engineering line surveys and undertaking load flow studies in the Lao PDR and \nThailand; (v) preparing preliminary design and technical specifications; (vi) conducting economic \nand financial analyses under ADB policies and guidelines; (vii) reviewing and updating EdL\u2019s \nfinancial management capacity; and (viii) ensuring safeguard compliance with relevant ADB \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples policies and guidelines. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $950,000 equivalent, comprising $550,000 in foreign \nexchange and $400,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance $800,000 equivalent. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan. The Government of the Lao PDR will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency costs through in-kind contributions. The contribution will include office accommodation \nand facilities, counterpart staff, data, and other information needed for the TA. Detailed cost \nestimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government of the Lao PDR has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  EdL  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  general  manager  of  EdL  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for the TA, and will set up a subunit staffed with counterpart personnel for day-to-\nday  coordination.  The  team  of  counterpart  personnel  consists  of  power  system  planning \nengineers, transmission and distribution engineers, environment and social management staff \nfor the study, accounting staff, staff related to the study, and technical assistants. The personnel \nwill  work  with  the  TA  consultant\u2019s  personnel  as  well  as  other  government  agencies, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other interested parties on environment, indigenous \npeoples, resettlement, and power sector policy issues. \n \n11.  The TA will require about 46 person-months of consulting services, including about 16 \ninternational and about 30 national. The study will be completed in 10 months, from October \n2006 to July 2007. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n12.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: \nExpansion of high-medium-voltage power transmission lines, and rural electrification are crucial for development. Only \n47% of households have access to electricity\u2014one of the lowest rates in Southeast Asia. The country has no \nintegrated national grid, since the existing high-voltage transmission lines were developed mainly to enable exporting \nof electricity from Lao PDR hydropower projects and to provide electricity to Vientiane Municipality. Outside the grid, \nrural households and communities have to rely on expensive off-grid power supply, or have no electricity. Expensive \nenergy hinders rural development and worsens the rural\u2013urban income gap. For sustainable and regionally balanced \ngrowth, the Government intends to electrify up to 90% of total households by 2020 mainly through grid extensions.  \n \nThe Government accords top priority to electrification of the northern provinces. Only 16.1% of households are \nelectrified in Bokeo, Luangnamtha, and Phongsaly provinces\u2014a rate much lower than the national average. The \nnorthern provinces are among the poorest in the Lao PDR, as over 58% of their households are poor, compared with \n4.4% in Vientiane Municipality. To eradicate poverty and promote sustainable economic growth, the Government\u2019s \npriority is to provide basic infrastructure, and has called for ADB\u2019s assistance to focus on these provinces. One priority \nmeasure to promote sustainable development is to increase electrification by extending transmission lines. \n \nAccess to modern sources of energy and subsidized energy (grid) in particular, is an equity issue. Most of the rural \nhouseholds and poor do not have access to grid, and pay indirectly for subsidies that do not benefit them. Under the \nproposed project, grid expansion and distribution lines would provide opportunities for rural electrification and \nindustrialization in the project areas. Improved electric supply will lift a significant constraint on economic growth. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (2004), projects classified as general intervention no longer \nrequire project poverty assessment. However, a social assessment will be conducted to prepare a resettlement plan \nand ethnic minority group-related activities, as well as for an HIV/AIDS and STD awareness program.  \n \nThe core analysis will be prepared from primary and secondary data.
