INTRODUCTION \n1.   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  regional  connectivity  in \nSoutheast Asia mainly through three subregional cooperation programs: (i) the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  (ii)  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand \nGrowth  Triangle  (IMT-GT),  and  (iii)  the  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines \nEast ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA).1 All three programs have prioritized trade facilitation \nas an important means to enhance regional connectivity and utilization of physical linkages. \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  support  customs  administrations  to  better \nimplement  the  various  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  trade  facilitation \ninitiatives. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s development agenda on regional integration under \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and would build upon previous and ongoing ADB support \nfor transport and trade facilitation in Southeast Asia.2 The TA is in line with the trade facilitation \ninitiative, the Asia Cargo Highway, launched by the Government of Japan in 2011, which \ninvolves four development partner institutions: (i) ADB; (ii) the Customs and Tariff Bureau, \nMinistry of Finance, Japan (CTB-MOF), (iii) Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); and \n(iv) the World Customs Organization (WCO). Under the initiative, the four development partners \nprovide  coordinated  assistance  for  customs  administrations  in  Asia;  the  initiative  is  fully \nendorsed by the ASEAN directors general and commissioners of customs administrations.3 The \nTA concept paper was approved in May 2013 and ADB fielded fact-finding missions to Brunei \nDarussalam, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Malaysia, Myanmar, \nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam (the target countries) in May\u2013August 2013. The missions \nreaffirmed the strong interest and demand for the TA in the target countries. The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint, adopted by the ASEAN leaders in \nNovember  2007  to  establish  ASEAN  as  a  single  market  and  production  base  by  2015, \ncomprises five core elements, including the free flow of goods. Significant progress has been \nachieved in tariff elimination under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement. However, the free \nflow of goods requires more than zero tariffs. The AEC Blueprint also points out that trade \nfacilitation is one of the primary means to facilitate the free flow of goods, and identifies policy \nand  procedural  measures  for  customs  that  are  critical  to  facilitate  trade.  Recognizing  that \ncustoms  administrations  play  a key  role  in facilitating trade to  build  a  well-connected  and \nintegrated AEC, the ASEAN Agreement on Customs (2012) and the Strategic Plan of Customs \nDevelopment,  2011\u20132015  were  adopted  to  simplify,  harmonize,  integrate,  and  modernize \ncustoms operations in ASEAN in accordance with relevant international standards, such as \nthose recommended by the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of \nCustoms Procedures (the Revised Kyoto Convention). Other ASEAN agreements, such as the \ntrade in goods agreement and the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods \nin Transit include provisions to promote greater predictability, transparency, and efficiency of \ncustoms administrations, as well as to harmonize and simplify customs procedures. These \n                                                \n1  Details about the GMS program are available at http://www.adb.org/gms. For the IMT-GT and BIMP-EAGA \nprograms, see http://www.adb.org/IMT-GT/ and www.adb.org/bimp/ .  \n2  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila.  \n3  ASEAN-Japan Customs Directors General and Commissioners Meeting on Trade Facilitation, April 2011, Phnom \nPenh, Cambodia. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 March 2014. \n ", "2  \nagreements serve as important road maps to facilitate trade in ASEAN, thereby contributing to \nestablishing ASEAN as a single market and production base. \n \n4.  ADB  has  been  supporting  trade  facilitation  initiatives  in  the  region,  including \ncomprehensive analytical work, development, and early implementation of the Cross Border \nTransport  Facilitation  Agreement  in  the  GMS;  conduct  of  time-release  studies  in  some \nSoutheast Asian countries; and capacity building for customs, immigration, quarantine, and \nsecurity agencies of BIMP-EAGA. The governments of Australia and Japan have been the two \nkey strategic development partners for ADB in delivering trade facilitation support in the region. \nOther partners such as the European Union, JICA, United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, World Bank, and WCO are active in supporting trade facilitation in Southeast \nAsia. 5  ADB  recently  convened  a  meeting  of  development  partners  to  promote  closer \ncoordination on trade facilitation support in the GMS.6  \n \n5.  Despite these numerous initiatives, many ASEAN members need to accelerate efforts to \nrealize the AEC by its 2015 target. Intraregional trade remains less than 30% of total ASEAN \ntrade.7 The ASEAN logistics performance index (LPI), a measure of customs performance \npublished by the World Bank, is low compared with Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand  Development  (OECD)  countries,  and  diverse  among  ASEAN  member  countries \nthemselves.8 The Doing Business Report indicates that an additional week, on average, is \nrequired  to  export  or  import  goods  in  Southeast  Asia  compared  with  OECD  countries.9 \nFurthermore, the AEC scorecard, published by the ASEAN Secretariat in 2012, shows that only \n49% (23 of 47) of measures for free flow of goods, including measures for trade facilitation and \nintegration to be implemented by 2011, have been met.10 Several performance indicators show \nthat strengthening of the capacity of customs administrations is urgently needed to improve the \nimplementation  of  trade  facilitation  policies,  procedures,  regulations,  and  management \nmeasures in Southeast Asia, and reduce institutional capacity gaps among ASEAN members.  \n \n                                                \n5  The World Bank has been supporting Cambodia and Lao PDR to modernize customs administration by introducing \nAutomated Systems for Customs Data. The Government of Australia has been supporting GMS member countries \nto implement the cross-border transport agreement for transport and trade facilitation in the GMS. The European \nUnion has been supporting the ASEAN to operationalize the ASEAN Customs Transit System under the ASEAN \nRegional Integration Support by the European Union. The United States Agency for International Development \nsupports the establishment of the ASEAN Single Window. JICA is dispatching customs advisors to Cambodia, Lao \nPDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Thailand, and supporting Myanmar and Viet Nam to develop customs \nautomation systems. WCO has been providing capacity-building activities for customs administrations in Southeast \nAsia in collaboration with JMOF and ADB. \n6  At the development partners meeting, 22\u201323 April 2014, at ADB headquarters, the partners agreed to share \ninformation on their ongoing support to ASEAN member states\u2014multilateral, ASEAN, subregional, and national. \nThe information is to be consolidated into one document and used by all development partners to identify who is \nbest placed to deliver certain aspects of the trade facilitation initiative and where collaboration is desirable. \n7  ADB. 2013.

The average LPI of customs in ASEAN is 2.93, and 3.55 \nfor OECD. Rankings of LPI for customs for ASEAN member states are Singapore (3rd), Malaysia (27th), Thailand \n(36th), Philippines (47th), Indonesia (55th), Viet Nam (61st), Cambodia (71st), Lao PDR (100th), and Myanmar \n(150th).  \n9  World Bank. 2013.

The outstanding measures include \nmodern tariff classification, customs valuation, and customs techniques (i.e., implementing the ASEAN cargo \nprocessing model, ASEAN customs declaration documents, pre-arrival clearance for customs clearance, and cargo \nrelease).  ", "  3\n6.  While regional and international customs frameworks and standards provide general \nprinciples and guidelines for various customs measures to facilitate trade, trade can only be \nfacilitated  effectively  and  efficiently  if  customs  administrations  are  equipped  with  sufficient \ninstitutional knowledge and capacity to apply those principles and guidelines. While customs \nplays a key role in facilitating trade at border crossings, trade procedures involve other border \ncontrol agencies, including immigration, quarantine, and security. Therefore, sharing knowledge \non regional and international best practices will contribute to enhancing coordinated border \nmanagement and operations conducted by customs, immigration, quarantine, security, and \nother government agencies within and between countries. More effective communication among \nvarious border control agencies, and more active participation of the private sector engaged in \ncross-border trade business are also essential measures of trade facilitation.  \n \n7.  Achieving  the  AEC  goal  of  a  single  market  and  production  base,  given  the  varied \nprogress of trade facilitation in individual ASEAN member states, is difficult. Such diversity, \nhowever, provides scope for knowledge sharing and partnerships. Knowledge sharing among \nmember states would narrow capacity gaps for harmonized procedures and operations. It would \nalso improve the effectiveness of development partner assistance for trade facilitation in the \nregion. With unique trade environments, and diverse customs administrations, each member \nstate would require tailored work plans for trade facilitation as well as tailored institutional \ncapacity-building programs. Such work plans would be developed to support each member to \nimplement  trade  facilitation  measures  as  prescribed  in  ASEAN  and  international  customs \nframeworks and standards. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be enhanced trade facilitation by customs administrations in participating \ncountries in accordance with various ASEAN agreements, thus contributing to the realization of \nAEC. The impact will be measured by improvements in logistics performance index scores for \nthe  efficiency  of  customs  and  border  clearance  procedures.  The  outcome  will  be  the \nimplementation  of  procedures,  regulations,  and  management  measures  by  customs \nadministrations to facilitate the cross-border movement of goods.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The outcome will be achieved by the delivery of three main outputs: (i) knowledge gaps \nand other constraints for customs to facilitate trade assessed, (ii) work plans for customs to \nfacilitate trade at border crossings developed, and (iii) capacity of customs to implement trade \nfacilitation work plans improved.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Knowledge gaps and other constraints for customs to facilitate trade \nassessed. The TA will support the comprehensive assessment of the need to strengthen the \nknowledge  and  institutional  capacity  of  customs  administrations,  and  identify  institutional, \nprocedural, and regulatory constraints to improve performance. This will involve (i) a review of \ntrade  facilitation  policies,  procedures,  regulations,  and  management  measures  of  the \nparticipating customs administrations in relation to ASEAN and other international customs \nframeworks and standards; (ii) a review of border management coordination between customs \nadministrations and other border control agencies; and (iii) identification of trade facilitation best \npractices and  experiences  that  can  be  shared  and  applied  by  participating  countries. The \nassessment will develop a performance scorecard to identify knowledge gaps and capacity-\n ", "4  \nbuilding needs. It will serve as the basis for focused advisory services and training programs, \nand the preparation of initial work plans for trade facilitation.  \n \n11.   Output  2:  Work  plans  for  customs  to  facilitate  trade  at  border  crossings \ndeveloped. The TA will prepare country-specific initial work plans for trade facilitation based on \nfindings of the assessment and the performance scorecards. The plans will specify practical \nsteps  to  introduce  trade  facilitation  measures  tailored  for  each  participating  customs \nadministration,  including  measures  to  improve  coordination  of  border  control  agencies \nperforming  customs-related  functions;  the  necessary  policies,  actions,  and  resources  to \nimplement recommended trade facilitation measures; and the necessary follow-up actions for \npossible  loan  intervention  projects.  A  regional  workshop  will  be  organized  to  present  and \ndiscuss the findings of the assessments, the performance scorecards, and the initial work plans \nfor  trade  facilitation.  The  workshop  will  facilitate  the  sharing  of  trade  facilitation-related \nexperience of customs administrations and promote dialogue with other government agencies \ninvolved in trade-related activities, the private sector, and development partners. This dialogue \nwill serve as a platform for customs administrations to discuss and identify trade facilitation \nbottlenecks requiring a coordinated approach to address and to refine the work plans.  \n \n12.  Output  3:  Capacity  of  customs  to  implement  trade  facilitation  work  plans \nimproved. Upon the endorsement of the trade facilitation work plans for each country under \noutput 2, the TA will support plan implementation and strengthen the capacity of customs \nofficials. Building upon the institutional sharing of knowledge and operating capacity of ASEAN \nmember states, the TA will organize tailored capacity-building national workshops for customs \nadministration in each of the participating countries so that effective implementation of the work \nplans can be achieved. The workshops will take into account possible collaboration with other \ndevelopment partners as appropriate. The TA will help participating countries improve and \ninstitutionalize  an  information-sharing  mechanism  for  customs,  immigration,  quarantine, \nsecurity, and other national and regional government agencies to share the implementation \nprogress  of  participating  countries\u2019  respective  work  plans.  Equipment  to  improve  customs \nadministrations  and modernize  their  operations,  such  as  personal  computers  and  customs \ninspection apparatus, will be introduced, where necessary.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million and will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction. ADB will administer the grant. The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  1  September  2014  to  31  August  2016.  ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast Asia Department will be the executing agency. ADB will work closely with customs \nadministrations in the ASEAN members as implementing agencies.11 Close coordination and \ncollaboration will be maintained with CTB-MOF, JICA, and WCO during TA implementation. As \nneeded,  officials  from  CTB-MOF,  JICA,  and  WCO  experts  dispatched  to  customs \nadministrations in Southeast Asia will be engaged as workshop resource persons to share best \npractices on international frameworks and customs standards. The TA will be implemented in \n                                                \n11 Royal Customs and Excise Department, Brunei Darussalam; General Department of Customs and Excise, \nCambodia;  Customs  Department,  Lao  PDR;  Royal  Malaysian  Customs  Department,  Malaysia;  Customs \nDepartment, Myanmar; Bureau of Customs, Philippines; Customs Department, Thailand; and General Department \nof Viet Nam Customs, Viet Nam.
