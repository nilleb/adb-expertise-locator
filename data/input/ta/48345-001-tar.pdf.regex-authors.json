INTRODUCTION \n1.   The Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), identifies the \nneed to promote more effective development processes in its 14 Pacific developing member \ncountries  (DMCs)  and  to  foster  connectivity,  consensus,  and  a  greater  sense  of  Pacific \ncommunity. The Pacific Approach sets out an agenda to help achieve this through ADB support \nfor (i) inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth, (ii) good governance, and (iii) regional \ncooperation and integration.1 \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach recognizes that most Pacific DMCs exhibit conditions of fragility. \nThis fragility contributes to their complex development environments and, among other things, is \ncharacterized  by  weak  state  performance  in  the  core  functions  of  policy  formulation  and \nresource  accumulation and  low  public  sector management  capacity. The  Pacific  Approach \nestablished that making policies without adequate analysis of sector or thematic issues was a \ncommon governance shortcoming in these DMCs, and that this often led to poor decisions that \nwere not in the public interest and undermined achievement of national development goals. \n \n3.  Pacific DMC governments are requesting that ADB provide technical assistance (TA) for \nsector and thematic analysis to inform and strengthen their decision making and improve their \npolicies. During 2009\u20132012, for example, ADB approved TA projects that provided analytical \nsupport  to  improve  policy  formulation  in  the  Pacific  DMCs  in  such  diverse  areas  as  the \nenvironment, water issues, transport, health, national planning, and state-owned enterprise \nreform.2 The TA for Sector and Thematic Analyses in Policy Development will help Pacific \nDMCs make better policies, improve policy dialogue with development partners, and enhance \naid effectiveness by providing dedicated analysis of development issues important to individual \ncountries and to other DMCs across the region. It will also build capacity in the development \nand use of this analysis. This approach is consistent with ADB\u2019s 2014 Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020  emphasis  on  promoting  South\u2013South  knowledge  sharing. 3  Lessons  from \nprevious assistance, as well as discussions with the governments of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, \nNauru, Solomon Islands, and Tonga, has informed the development of the impact, outcome, \nand outputs of the TA, as well as its costs, implementation arrangements, and the terms of \nreference for consulting services.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Deciding on policies without undertaking the proper sector or thematic analysis has \nsignificant opportunity costs. This means that public funds and staffing resources are committed \nto poorly designed and targeted policies and budgets that hinder Pacific DMC efforts to achieve \ntheir  national  development  goals,  for  example,  increasing  agricultural  crops  for  export  or \nimproving water quality and access. This opportunity cost is particularly high in the Pacific \nDMCs because their organizational and technical capacity and financial resources are limited. \nThese DMCs, their universities, and the regional technical organizations  lack the ability  to \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 December 2014. \n ", "2   \n \nproduce the necessary analysis and fill the region\u2019s significant knowledge gaps.5  The problem \nis made more acute by the lack of appropriate government staff needed to meet the broad \nrange of policy challenges the DMCs face. Pacific DMCs recognize that thorough, bottom-up \nanalysis of their sector challenges and cross-cutting development themes is vital and will (i) help \nthem identify and define their strategic priorities more clearly, (ii) help them design better policy, \n(iii) improve coordination and mobilization of development assistance, and (iv) allow effective \nprioritization and sequencing in policy implementation.6 \n \n5.  Recent development partner engagement in policy dialogue with Pacific governments in \nsupport of policy-based operations have practically demonstrated the use of sector and thematic \nanalyses to guide policy priority setting and development.7 This alignment of policy dialogue, \nanalysis, and capacity building, moves way from what has been seen as ad hoc, fragmented, \nand unsustainable technical assistance to develop national and regional capacity in analysis \nand  policy  development  in  the  Pacific  DMCs.8 There  is  considerable  scope  for  sector  or \nthematic-specific dialogue with government to be similarly supported by such analysis.  \n \n6.  Although  demand  for  sector  and  thematic  analysis  has  increased,  and  the  Pacific \ncountries and their development partners have more incentive to collaborate and coordinate to \naddress knowledge gaps, DMCs need to take ownership of the analysis that results from ADB \nassistance and actually apply it in their policy formulation for the process to succeed (footnote 6). \nIt is therefore important that ADB remains open and responsive to the expressed country needs, \nwithin the boundaries of its own strategy on engagement in each DMC. This will ensure that \nADB\u2019s TA resources will be used in areas where ADB can bring a comparative advantage to \nanalyses  whose  findings  governments  will  remain  committed  to  and  follow  up  on  in  a \nsustainable way. In addition, when meeting sector and thematic analytical needs, ADB will give \npriority to work that cannot be supported through existing country or regional TA, such as its \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative and Pacific economic management TA projects (footnote \n2). This will help to avoid duplication and ensure that ADB and other development partners are \nextending limited TA resources across country and knowledge needs. \n \n7.  Experience and lessons from TAs by ADB and other development partners show that \nanalyses and knowledge should (i) suit the preferences of specific audiences, and (ii) reinforce \nconsistent  messaging  to  facilitate  follow-through  and  ongoing  implementation.  Many  small \nPacific DMCs face similar development challenges, and so cross-learning and multicountry \nassessments are an effective way to develop solutions that are appropriate across the region \nand deepen the understanding of development constraints and the effective policy responses. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA project will support the efforts of the governments of 12 of the 14 Pacific DMCs \nto  improve  policy  formulation  and  decision  making  through  rigorous  sector  and  thematic \n                                                \n5  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2013.

Manila. \n7  During 2009\u20132014, ADB approved 15 projects totaling about $112 million to support policy reforms in the Cook \nIslands, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu. This amounted to 9% of ADB\u2019s \ntotal assistance in the Pacific. Other development partners provided about $150 million in similar support over the \nsame period. In 2015, the ADB Board is scheduled to consider a further five policy-based programs amounting to \n$18 million. \n8  ADB. 2014.

Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste are not included because they can get country \nlevel assistance. \n  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be implementation of policies developed by the assessments achieve \ntheir stated objectives. Achievement of the impact will be measured by incorporation of these \npolicies into national planning documents (including sector plans and Ministry corporate plans) \nand funding  in  the  national  budgets.  The  outcome  will  be  uptake  of improved  sector  and \nthematic assessments in participating Pacific DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  aims  to  deliver  rigorous  sector  and  thematic  assessments  to  Pacific  DMC \ngovernments. It will focus initially on analyses for the governments of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, \nNauru, Solomon Islands, and Tonga, all of which have requested this support. The TA will seek \nto develop capacity through the promotion and sharing of national and regional knowledge and \ngood practices. Building on previous experience and lessons learned, the TA is designed to \nserve as a facility for ADB that is flexible and responsive without imposing significant transaction \ncosts on Pacific DMCs (footnote 2). This is particularly relevant for Pacific DMCs that have been \ncontinuously requesting small scale TA to assist with analyses. \n \n11.  Output 1: Improvement in sector and thematic assessments. The TA will finance \nsector and thematic assessments that will underpin policy formulation, improve the quality of \npolicy dialogue, identify and prioritize opportunities for sector investments, and support the \nimplementation of sector projects. Sectors and themes that may be covered in the Cook Islands, \nKiribati, Solomon Islands, and Tonga in the first 6 months of TA implementation are transport, \ninformation and communication technology, education, and energy. In Kiribati and Nauru, these \nmay include the water sector and other urban infrastructure and services, particularly urban \nhousing. The assessments produced will also inform the preparation of future ADB country \npartnership strategies and expanded country operations business plans. Assessments in other \nPacific DMCs will be included under the TA, subject to the prioritization criteria in para. 19. \n \n12.  Output 2: Promotion of South\u2013South knowledge cooperation. The TA will promote \nSouth\u2013South  knowledge  cooperation  through  the  production  of  targeted  publications  and \norganization  of  regional  seminars  and  workshops  that  will  highlight  common  experiences, \nlessons  learned,  and  good  practices.  The  TA  will  share  the  results  of  the  analyses  with \nparticipating Pacific DMCs and other stakeholders through country reports, technical reports, \nand  knowledge  products.  Lessons  learned  and  good  practices  identified  through  the  TA \nactivities will be disseminated at the regional level when opportunities arise.  \n \n13.  The TA design has assumed that the participating Pacific DMCs will remain politically \nstable; that strong national and subregional demand for the type of analysis the TA can support \nwill continue; that the DMC governments will be willing to use the analysis results to guide \npolicies and planning; that skilled and experienced consultants will be available and recruited in \na timely manner for the TA activities; and that suitable government counterpart contributions will \nbe readily available. All TA support operations will focus on reinforcing ADB\u2019s engagement \nacross specific sectors and themes in the Pacific, helping to understand and improve the design \nand implementation of key sector or thematic activities, and  providing new areas for ADB \nassistance. \n \n ", "4   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will be responsible for \nimplementation in cooperation with the national ministries and agencies concerned. No TA \nactivities will be undertaken in the territory of a Pacific DMC until a no-objection confirmation \nhas been obtained from the government of that DMC.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 48 months, starting in December 2014. Should the \nneed arise, additional financing will be sought for this TA from cofinanciers or trust funds. Such \nadditional financing would allow for upscaling the number of sector and thematic assessments \nor knowledge products and events set as output targets in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). \n \n17.  The TA will finance an estimated  18 person-months of international and 7 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. Depending on what is appropriate to each task, the \nconsultants will be engaged through a firm or individually. This will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline \nterms of reference for the consulting positions are in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n18.  Because demand for the TA resources is expected to be high, they will be allocated for \nanalyses of priority issues and on subject matters that have no alternate source of ADB support \nunder the Private sector development initiative, the Pacific economic management, and the \nPacific regional infrastructure facility TA projects, since each of these is also providing ongoing \nassistance for knowledge development and sharing in the region (footnote 2). ADB will solicit \ncountry requests for support through country team leaders twice a year. These requests will be \nprioritized based on whether (i) the issue aligns with current priority areas for ADB assistance in \nthe country or identified future priority assistance areas; (ii) a lead agency in-country is identified \nto follow through on promoting the policy issue and implementation; (iii) the issue has broad \nrelevance to other Pacific countries; (iv) no other ADB TA could meet the need for assistance; \nand (v) no other development partner is able to undertake the requested assistance.  \n \n19.  The  TA  will  be  overseen  by  the  project  officer,  with  specific  tasks  also  monitored \nregularly by relevant country officers and project specialists. A review of the TA, including the \ncriteria for edibility, will be undertaken after 18 months of TA implementation.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nSector and Thematic Analyses in Policy Development, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2020:    Assumptions \n \nImplementation of  Policies developed in  National policy  The political situation in \npolicies developed by  areas supported by the  monitoring mechanisms  the participating Pacific \nthe assessments  technical assistance in    DMCs will remain \nachieve their stated  participating countries are  National plan monitoring  stable. \nobjectives  proving effective            and evaluation reports   \n(Baseline 2013:  0)    Adequate country \nStrategic policy  resources will be \nstatements  directed to \n  implementing policies.  \nNational budget \n \nstatements and \nestimates   \n \n \nCountry performance \nassessment results  Risk \n    Political interference \noccurs in policy \n   \ndevelopment and \nimplementation. \nOutcome  By end 2018:    Assumptions \n \nUptake of improved  Policies in at least 5  Country operations  Changes in government \nsector and thematic  supported sectors and/or  business plans  policies are based on \nassessments  themes in participating    knowledge.  \ncountries are based on  Program and/or project   \nanalyses undertaken  board documents  Pacific DMCs have \n(Baseline 2013: 0)  national ownership of \nstrategies, policies, and \n   \nplans. \n   \n \nRisk \nGovernments fail to \ntake action on policy \nadvice produced by TA \nanalyses. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n \n1.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will engage consulting services to support the \nimplementation of its technical assistance (TA) for Sector and Thematic Analyses in Policy \nDevelopment  in  12  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  The  TA  will  require  18 \nperson-months of international services and 7 person-months of national consulting inputs. The \nTA is designed to respond flexibly to the needs for sector and thematic assessments, and \nconsulting services requirements will therefore be determined on a case-by-case basis. The \nconsultants will comprise a pool of sector specialists and policy advisors (international and \nnational advisers) who will work under the guidance of the country team leaders and country, \nregional,  or  sector  directors. The  terms  of reference  will  be  cleared  by  ADB\u2019s  Operations \nServices  and  Financial  Management  Department  before  the  positions  are  advertised  and \nrecruitment is undertaken. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n2.  Sector  specialists  (national  and  international,  maximum  25  person-months, \nintermittent). Sector specialists will have postgraduate degree or an equivalent qualification that \nis appropriate to the specific task in economics, urban planning, environmental science, political \nscience,  governance,  heath,  education,  information  and  communication  technology,  trade \nfacilitation  and  security,  or  civil  engineering.  The  specialists  will  have  at  least  5  years  of \nexperience in a senior management position in the task-specific sector or theme. The specialists \nwill work under the guidance of ADB sector specialists and sector directors and will consult with \ncountry team leaders and country or regional directors to ensure that country-specific issues are \nreflected in the assessments. \n \n3.  A  multidisciplinary  team  of  economists  and  other  specialists  with  expertise  in \nundertaking applied analytical work in the relevant sectors will be selected to carry out a review \nand assessment of the relevant governments\u2019 sector and thematic strategies (where these exist); \ndevelopment assistance to the sector; and sector performance, issues, and opportunities. \n \n4.  Specific tasks will be determined on an as-needed basis, depending on the priority areas \nof the selected Pacific DMC. The tasks could include  \n(i)  consulting with the governments of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, \nand Tonga to review strategies in the transport, information and communication \ntechnology,  education,  and  energy  sectors  and  identifying  potential  sector \nopportunities; \n(ii)  consulting with the governments of Kiribati and Nauru to review strategies in the \nwater and other urban infrastructure sectors, particularly urban housing, and \nidentifying potential sector opportunities; \n(iii)  reviewing the sector and thematic performances of these and other selected \nDMCs and identifying pertinent issues; \n(iv)  analyzing  Pacific  region-wide  lessons  learned  from  comparable  sector  and \nthematic studies; \n(v)  identifying development priorities in each sector and theme; \n(vi)  working closely with relevant sector and thematic agencies and development \npartners  to  ensure  proposed  options  complement  ongoing  activities  to  avoid \nduplication; and \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n(vii)  preparing sector or thematic assessments for the selected governments and \nADB,  using  existing  applicable  guidelines  or  frameworks  (e.g.,  Second \nGovernance and Anticorruption Action Plan). \n \n5.
