", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat (ASEC) is mandated \nby member countries of ASEAN to facilitate and monitor economic integration in the region. But \neven as the demands on ASEC have increased with the growing pace and scope of economic \nintegration,  limited  capacity  has  constrained  its  support.  The  capacity  of  ASEC  must  be \nstrengthened, to enable it to provide support to ASEAN, a main driving force for Asian economic \nintegration. A memorandum of understanding was signed on 24 August 2006 by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and ASEC to establish the overall framework for ADB support for \nASEAN economic integration, including the strengthening of ASEC\u2019s capacity. \n \n2.  To  implement  the  memorandum  of  understanding,  ADB  provided  regional  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) in support of ASEC in 2007\u20132008.1 The TA is now in its \nfinal stage but ASEC has suggested an expansion in the scope of assistance to make the \nASEAN Economic Community (AEC) a reality. The proposed TA, a continuation of the ongoing \nfacility (footnote 1), will strengthen the capacity of ASEC for ASEAN economic integration and \nthus accelerate the creation of the AEC. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.2  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  At the 9th ASEAN Summit in Indonesia in October 2003, the ASEAN leaders agreed to \ncreate the AEC by 2020 and transform ASEAN into a stable, prosperous, and highly competitive \nregion with reduced poverty and socioeconomic disparities. The 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu, \nPhilippines, in early 2007 advanced the deadline to 2015, and the 13th ASEAN Summit in \nSingapore in November of that year produced an agreement to develop an AEC blueprint. The \nblueprint would map out the measures to be taken, as well as targets and timelines, for the \ncreation of the AEC. ASEC has been tasked to monitor the implementation of the AEC.  \n \n4.  ADB provided the first regional TA (footnote 1) for 2007\u20132008 at the request of ASEC to \nstrengthen its capacity to facilitate and monitor the implementation of the AEC. The major \noutputs3 of the TA, after a year of implementation, have been well received by the economic and \nfinance  ministers  of  ASEAN.  Among  others,  these  outputs  include  (i) macroeconomic \nsurveillance  reports  and  policy  issue  papers  presented  at  various  ASEAN  meetings  and \nsummits; (ii) background and working papers used in discussions on free-trade agreements \n(FTAs), liberalization of trade in services, and priority integration sectors; (iii) inputs to the \ndrafting of the AEC communication plan and AEC implementation scorecards; (iv) support for \nvarious workshops and dialogues; and (vi) capacity development activities for ASEC staff. The \nTA also facilitated the participation of ADB in high-level regional policy dialogues like the East \nAsia Summit and ASEAN Finance Ministers Meeting.  \n \n5.  The  unfolding  global  economic  crisis  is  affecting  the  ASEAN  countries  and  has \ncompelled them to redouble their efforts to integrate their economies. More than ever before, \nthe creation of a single ASEAN market is imperative. The traditional export markets of ASEAN \nlike Japan, the European Union, and the United States are in recession. ASEAN can no longer \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Capacity of the ASEAN Secretariat in Regional Economic \nIntegration and Policy Dialogue. Manila (TA 6393-REG). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 20 February 2009. \n3  A more detailed summary of the accomplishments is available upon request. \n ", "2  \nrely on exports to these markets as it did in the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial and economic crisis. \nA single ASEAN market would help cushion the impact of the current crisis on ASEAN countries.  \n \n6.  This  timely  follow-on  TA  will  support  ASEC  and  the  ASEAN  member  countries  in \naccelerating the achievement of the AEC. It will build on the progress made and lessons learned \nin the first TA. One of the main lessons from that TA is the need to increase support for ASEC to \nstrengthen  its  capacity  for  macroeconomic  surveillance,  trade,  and  investment.  Continued \nsupport for ASEC in these areas through the proposed TA will facilitate the realization of the \nAEC blueprint by 2015.  \n \n7.  Other donor countries and institutions recognize the importance of ASEAN as a de facto \nregional  economic  hub  and  have  provided  technical  assistance  to  ASEC.  Among  these \ncountries  and  institutions  are  Australia  (new  ASEAN-Australia  Development  Cooperation \nProgram); the European Union (ASEAN Program for Integration Support); Japan (support for \nthe  Economic  Research  Institute  for  ASEAN  and  East  Asia);  and  the  United  States \n(ASEAN-USAID Technical Assistance and Training Facility).4 \n \n8.  ASEC presented the AEC blueprint at an informal coordination meeting of donors on \n9 July 2008 and discussed the proper coordination of donor assistance for priority programs \nover  the  next  3\u20135  years.  The  donor  countries  and  institutions  sought  ways  of  avoiding \nduplication and overlap in their work, and identified critical gaps in project implementation. This \nconsultation mechanism will be regularized and formalized by ASEC.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA is aimed at strengthening the capacity of ASEC to facilitate and monitor the \nrealization of the AEC by 2015.  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will support improvements in the quality and effectiveness of ASEAN policy \ndialogues for ASEAN economic integration. It is expected to enhance the institutional capacity \nof ASEC to facilitate and coordinate the achievement of \n(i)   a single market and production base, \n(ii)   a competitive economic region, \n(iii)   equitable economic development in the region, and  \n(iv)   an ASEAN that is more integrated into the global economy. \n \n11.  Single Market and Production Base. The expected results and deliverables in this \narea include the following: \n(i)  a study on nontariff barriers and nontariff measures applied at industry and firm \nlevel in selected ASEAN countries; \n                                                 \n4 The A$45 million ASEAN-Australia Development Cooperation Program was first implemented in 2002\u20132003. The \nEuropean Union\u2013ASEAN Program for Integration Support, a \u20ac4.5 million project, is a framework program whose \naim is to assist ASEAN member countries in regional integration. Established in 2004 and housed within the \nASEAN Secretariat, the $6 million ASEAN\u2013United States Technical Assistance and Training Facility is the flagship \nproject of the ASEAN Cooperation Plan. (Available: http://www.aseansec.org/4982.htm) \n \n ", "      3\n(ii)  a trade facilitation assessment framework, including a trade facilitation manual; \n(iii)  a study on ways of liberalizing trade in services, identifying the limitations, issues, \nimplications, and approaches;  \n(iv)  training and workshops in trade in services; and \n(v)  macroeconomic  assessment  tools,  models,  and  methods,  including  manuals, \nguidelines, and materials for implementing them.  \n \n12.  Competitive Economic Region. The expected results and deliverables in this area \ninclude the following: \n(i)  studies on business practices in markets and products of critical importance to \ngovernments and consumers in ASEAN; \n(ii)  recommendations on possible areas of reform and strengthening in competition \npolicy, laws, and administrative regulations in markets and products of critical \nimportance to governments and consumers in ASEAN, and concrete measures \nto achieve such reform and strengthening; and \n(iii)  a better understanding and improved capabilities of ASEC staff on international \nbest practices in markets and products of critical importance to governments and \nconsumers in ASEAN, and ASEC staff with increased capability to deal with \nthose practices. \n \n13.  Equitable  Economic  Development.  The  expected  results  in  this  area  will  be \nincorporated into the other outcome areas. For example, more of the participants in the capacity \ndevelopment programs will come from less-developed ASEAN member countries, and country \nstudies will be carried out in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam.  \n \n14.  Integration into the Global Economy. The expected results and deliverables in this \narea include the following: \n(i)  studies on the effectiveness of ASEAN FTAs, the potentials of ASEAN FTAs with \nGulf Coast Countries (GCC) and the Mercado Com\u00fan del Sur (Mercosur, the \nSouthern Common Market), and the impact of the ASEAN\u2013People\u2019s Republic of \nChina FTA; \n(ii)  studies reviewing and identifying areas needing revision and development in the \nASEAN dispute settlement system; \n(iii)  training in legal interpretation and drafting, international trade and business laws, \nand compliance monitoring and evaluation; and \n(iv)  a compilation of training materials, case law abstracts, and studies, as well as \nanalytical methods and approaches used in World Trade Organization (WTO) \ndispute  cases,  the  Vienna  Convention  on  the  Law  of  Treaties  and  other \ninternational trade and business laws, and compliance monitoring and evaluation.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will continue to support the Bureau of Economic Integration and Finance (BEIF) \nof ASEC in two broad areas\u2014research and policy support. All the activities in each of these \nareas will have a capacity development component.  \n \n16.  International consultants will be hired to undertake technical studies and other activities \nidentified in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. Seminars and workshops will \nbe held to disseminate results, and training will be conducted to reinforce learning. Regular \nexchange of knowledge and information will allow the monitoring of activities.  ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000. This amount, to be financed with a grant from \nthe Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility, will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants, as \nwell  as  training,  workshops,  publications,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be executed by ADB and managed by the ADB Office of Regional Economic \nIntegration (OREI), in close coordination with the ADB Southeast Asia Department. It will be \nimplemented by BEIF in close consultation with ADB over 18 months, from March 2009 to \nAugust 2010.  \n \n19.  A grant agreement will be signed by ADB and ASEC. Patterned after the ADB grant \nagreement for the Prevention and Control of Avian Influenza in Asia and the Pacific,5 it will give \nASEC the flexibility to undertake studies on emerging issues in ASEAN economic integration. A \nseparate account will be created in ASEC to contain the funds for the TA activities. ASEC will \ndraw from the account according to the terms and conditions of the grant agreement.  \n \n20.  Two international consultants\u2014a macroeconomist and a trade economist\u2014based at \nASEC in Jakarta, Indonesia, will oversee the work related to macroeconomics and finance, and \ntrade. Two national consultants, also based at ASEC in Jakarta, will support the international \nconsultants and coordinate with ADB.  \n \n21.  In  addition,  a  project  coordinator  based  at  ADB  headquarters  will  oversee  the \nimplementation  of  the  TA  and  coordinate  with  ASEC.  When  necessary  and  with  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence, ASEC may also hire experts in pertinent fields to undertake studies on emerging \nissues. All consultants will be hired individually for three main reasons: (i) all consultants will \nwork separately with their own responsibilities, outputs, and geographic coverage; (ii) the work \ndoes  not  require  coordination  of  tasks;  and  (iii)  the  required  expertise  is  specialized  and \ndiversified and therefore difficult to source from a single firm. The selection and hiring of the \nconsultants, and their services, will conform to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done according to \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.6 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening the Capacity of the ASEAN Secretariat in Regional Economic Integration and \nPolicy Dialogue\u2014Phase 2, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.
