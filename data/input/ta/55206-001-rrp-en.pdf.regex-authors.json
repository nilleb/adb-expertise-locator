THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the COVID-19 Vaccine Support Project \nunder the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX). \n \n2.  The project will finance the procurement of vaccines against the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19), logistics, and capacity strengthening for the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic \nthrough APVAX.1 The Kyrgyz Republic has met all the APVAX access criteria (Table 1). The rapid \nresponse component and the project investment component under APVAX will be utilized. The \nproject will support the implementation of the National Vaccination Deployment Plan (NVDP), in \nline with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 It will complement efforts to \ncontain the COVID-19 pandemic and enable economic recovery in the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) region. \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \n Access Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nDemonstrated adverse  The COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp recession in which GDP declined by 8.6% in 2020, \nimpact of COVID-19  compared with growth of 4.6% in 2019.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  The COVID-19 Pandemic \n  \n3.  Status of the pandemic. The Kyrgyz Republic confirmed its first cases of COVID-19 on \n17 March 2020, and 176,682 cases and 2,557 deaths have been reported as of 8 September \n2021. Access to testing remains low, resulting in underreporting of cases. Noncompliance with \nsocial distancing and masking guidelines, and the emergence of highly infectious variants, have \nresulted in a third wave of infections beginning in June 2021. The country experienced a record \nnumber (about 2,000) of new cases per day at the end of June, and the situation remains unstable. \nWidespread vaccination is needed to end the pandemic and facilitate economic recovery.  \n \n4.  Country context. The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked, lower middle-income country in \nCentral Asia. Transit arrangements with neighbors are critical to maintain trade and tourism, and \nto  ease  the  mobility  of  migrant  workers,  as  remittances  are  important  for  the  economy\u2014\naccounting for about a third of gross domestic product (GDP). The country remains one of the \npoorest countries in Central Asia, with gross national income per capita of $1,160 (Atlas method) \nin 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic has achieved better health outcomes than most other lower middle- \nincome  countries (e.g.,  the  diphtheria,  tetanus,  and  pertussis  immunization rate  was  95%, \ncompared with 84% in lower middle-income countries, in 2019). However, even with relatively \nstrong health indicators and high levels of government financing in the health sector), the Kyrgyz \nRepublic has not been able to control the pandemic effectively.3 \n \n2.  Impact of the Pandemic \n \n5.  Economic impact. The economy of the Kyrgyz Republic has experienced major negative \nimpacts from COVID-19 because of external (remittances, migration, border closures, interrupted \ntrade) and domestic (direct health effects, lockdown, and social distancing) factors. Import \ndisruption under COVID-19\u2014affecting raw materials, equipment, and food from other countries\u2014\nheld back manufacturing, construction, and other import-dependent industries. In 2020, GDP \ndeclined by 8.6% (from 4.6% growth in 2019) because of negative performance across all sectors \nexcept agriculture. Average annual inflation jumped from 1.1% in 2019 to 6.3% in 2020 as prices \nrose by 17.6% for food, 2.4% for other goods, and 3.0% for services because of border closures \nand supply chain disruptions.4 Economic growth is projected to recover to 3.5% in 2021 and 5.0% \nin 2022, but with significant downside risks because of the country\u2019s dependence on broad \nrecovery in the subregion and the Russian Federation. Any recurring pandemic waves or slow \nvaccine rollout could derail growth.    \n  \n6.  Impact on poor and vulnerable groups. In 2019, 20.1% of the population was below the \nnational poverty line.5 With the downturn linked to the pandemic, the share of the population that \nis poor increased by almost 11.0% (700,000 people) in 2020, according to government estimates.6 \nA 2020 joint ADB\u2013United Nations Development Programme report found that the pandemic \naffected the welfare of vulnerable groups through (i) lost income and/or loss of work or jobs (both \nat home and abroad) because of lockdowns and border closures, (ii) higher consumer and food \n \n3  World Health Organization (WHO).

One Year Later in the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s Battle Against COVID-19.  \n \n ", "  3 \n \nprices, (iii) reduced access to quality health care and other essential social services, and \n(iv) reduced resilience to future shocks (e.g., by reducing savings or other assets).7 Particularly \nvulnerable groups include older persons, poor households with children, women, people with \nspecial needs, and the unemployed.  \n \n7.  Impact on gender equality. Women are disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 \npandemic because of large gender gaps in employment, wages, and income; the rise in domestic \nviolence; and increased responsibilities for domestic care. Women also make up 83% of the \nhealth workforce in the Kyrgyz Republic, leading to increased risks of disease transmission and \nmortality. An assessment of the impact of COVID-19 found that women in the Kyrgyz Republic \nwere particularly vulnerable to lockdown restrictions including decreased access to food supplies, \nmedicines, health care, and social services.8 Women reported an 80% increase in unpaid care \nand domestic work because of lockdowns and school closures compared to a 58% increase \nreported by men. Domestic violence also rose by 65% in 2020 compared with 2019. More self-\nemployed women than men have reported job losses and shortened work hours since the start of \nthe pandemic.9 \n \n8.  Impact on the health system. As of 17 June 2021, more than 6,000 health workers out \nof about 30,000 health workers in the country have been infected. The Kyrgyz Republic has \n4.4 hospital beds, 2.2 doctors, and 5.9 nurses per 1,000 people, which is high compared with \nother lower middle-income countries. Despite this relatively high level of resources, the health \nsystem was still stretched to the limit during the peaks of the pandemic. The health sector budget \nincreased by more than 20% in 2020 to absorb the additional expenditures to fight COVID-19. \nTreatment is provided free of charge to patients. According to the World Health Organization \n(WHO) and media reports, routine immunizations were interrupted and hospitals were inundated \nduring the second wave of the pandemic, with patients turned away and health workers in short \nsupply. \n  \n3.  Country Response \n  \n9.  Measures to control the pandemic. The government adopted its first legislation to \naddress COVID-19 on 29 January 2020. It requested emergency assistance from ADB on 6 April \n2020. To coordinate the COVID-19 response, the Republican Headquarters for the Prevention of \nthe Spread of COVID-19 was established in the Ministry of Emergency Services, with the Prime \nMinister of the Kyrgyz Republic as chair and representatives of all ministries and state agencies \nas members. To respond to the substantial adverse impact of COVID-19, the government \ninstituted countermeasures of about $570 million10 covering food security, business support, state \nbudget stability, and health. A separate COVID-19 headquarters was established in the Ministry \nof  Health  and  Social  Development  (MOHSD)  to  manage  the  health  sector  response.  The \ngovernment prepared the National Contingency Action Plan for COVID-19 response with partners \nled by WHO, and activated inter-sector and interagency coordination mechanisms.  \n \n \n7  ADB and United Nations Development Programme. 2020.

Washington, DC. \n \n ", "4   \n \n10.  Since the pandemic began, the government has implemented several health system \nmeasures with development partners\u2019 support, including (i) enlisting medical students and interns \nto increase the number of health workers, (ii) designating COVID-19 treatment and quarantine \nfacilities, (iii) providing virtual medical consultations to limit in-person contact, (iv) setting up a \nCOVID-19 hotline to respond to public concerns and inquiries, (v) increasing testing capacity by \naccrediting additional public and private laboratories, and (vi) providing hardship allowances to \nhealth workers working with COVID-19 patients. Partners such as ADB, WHO, and the World \nBank have all supported the country to strengthen its response to COVID-19 by providing \ntechnical guidance and clinical recommendations; procuring supplies such as patient beds, \nventilators, ambulances, personal protective equipment (PPE), and medicines; and upgrading \nmedical facilities. These actions have contributed to improved quality of care and health system \ncapacity.  By  the  end  of  2020,  the  government  had  deployed  an  additional  8,000  beds  in \n161 facilities all over the country, more than 800 of which were for intensive care patients to \naccommodate patient surges. \n \n11.  ADB approved the COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency Project for the Kyrgyz Republic in \n2020, which has delivered more than $5 million in PPE and medical supplies. The project plans \nto equip at least 102 intensive care unit beds and 650 COVID-19 patient beds across 18 COVID-\n19 treatment facilities; and supply 13 ambulances, 91 ventilators, and 17 x-rays, among other \nsupplies, by 2022.11 It will improve the quality of select COVID-19 treatment facilities through \ncapacity building of health workers, the provision of civil works to upgrade facilities, and supplies \nto conduct at least 100,000 additional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for COVID-19.  \n \n12.  National  Vaccination  Deployment  Plan  for  COVID-19  Vaccines.  The  MOHSD \ndeveloped the NVDP in February 2021 with members from the National Immunization Technical \nAdvisory Group and representatives from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and \nWHO to establish a clear strategy for implementing the COVID-19 vaccine program. The NVDP \nbuilds on WHO\u2019s Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool and the World Bank\u2019s \nVaccine Readiness Assessment Framework. The NVDP is aligned with WHO policies and \nstrategies. The government aims to vaccinate 40% of the population at present.12 The first stage \nis vaccination of priority groups. The first group (3% of the total population) includes all health \nworkers, social and education sector workers, and people with cancer. The second group (17% \nof the total population) includes people aged 60 and above, special populations working at border \nentry points and in direct contact with travelers, and people with specific chronic comorbidities. \nThe second stage covers the remaining 20% of the population and includes people who are \nabove 18 years old but do not fall into any of the categories outlined in the first two groups. The \nWHO Regional Review Committee has approved the NVDP. \n \n13.  Vaccination services are provided by primary care health workers who receive targeted \ntraining, through various sites including mass vaccination centers, primary health centers, and \nother facilities. Mobile clinics are deployed to reach older persons, people with disability, and \nrural populations in remote and border areas to ensure equitable distribution. All vaccines are \noffered free of charge to the public. Cold chain equipment has been provided by Gavi, the Vaccine \nAlliance (Gavi) and UNICEF through previous projects and is expected to be sufficient to manage \nthe additional supplies for COVID-19 vaccinations.  \n \n \n11 ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n12 Excluding minors 18 years of age and below (about 2.4 million people) and migrant workers who are not in the \ncountry (about 1.0 million people) out of the total population of 6.6 million. \n \n ", "  5 \n \n14.  The total cost estimate to implement the NVDP is $51.3 million. The amount includes the \nfunding requirements for vaccines and injection supplies, with an estimated cost of $13 per dose. \nThe NVDP will be funded through the government budget; COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access \n(COVAX); Gavi, channeled through UNICEF and WHO; and development partners including ADB, \nthe Islamic Development Bank, and the World Bank.13 The MOHSD has led vaccine procurement, \nwith support from the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The government plans to procure \nadditional vaccines to implement the NVDP through COVAX, UNICEF, and bilateral agreements \nwith manufacturers. \n \n15.  The NVDP will be monitored with the support of the government\u2019s Republican Center for \nImmunoprophylaxis, which is responsible for the surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases. \nWith the support of the World Bank, the government introduced a digital registration system for \npatients and facilities in June 2021. The Communication and Social Mobilization Working Group \nof the MOHSD will lead social listening, media monitoring, and community engagement. Vaccine \nhesitancy is being addressed through targeted outreach and education campaigns, with the \nsupport of community groups such as religious leaders and local governments. An inventory \nmanagement system is in place to track vaccine stocks. Adverse events following immunization \nwill be monitored and reported in line with WHO guidelines at all levels of the health system; and \nwill involve health care facilities, territorial Centers for Disease Prevention; district, city, and/or \nregional  State  Sanitary  and  Epidemiological  Surveillance;  the  Republican  Center  for \nImmunoprophylaxis; and the National Drug Regulatory Authority. The COVID-19 vaccination \nprogram began on 29 March 2021. As of 6 September 2021, 710,470 people have been \nvaccinated with at least one dose (490,322 have received two doses).  \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n16.  The MOHSD is working closely with development partners through the health sector \nworking group of the Development Partner\u2019s Coordinating Committee to mobilize funding and \nensure close coordination to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.14 ADB\u2019s proposed project \ncomplements the assistance of other development partners. The Kyrgyz Republic is a member \nof the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC), one of the four pillars of the Access to \nCOVID-19 Tools Accelerator.15 The priority 20% of the population will be financed through \nCOVAX AMC for about $18.3 million, and the initial delivery of vaccines (226,560 doses of \nAstraZeneca) was received on 30 July 2021. The government vaccination campaign also uses \nvaccines donated by and procured from the People\u2019s Republic of China (Sinopharm) and the \nRussian Federation (Sputnik V). COVAX supports the government with additional cold chain \nequipment funded through Gavi, and with technical assistance through UNICEF and WHO. In \nJune 2021, the World Bank approved $20 million of additional financing to support vaccine \nprocurement and deployment.  \n \n17.  Lessons learned. The proposed APVAX project draws on important lessons learned \nduring the design and implementation of ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency Project in the \nKyrgyz Republic (footnote 11). That project has demonstrated the importance of (i) collaborating \nclosely  with  development  partners  to  minimize  overlap  and  coordinate  key  activities; \n \n13  More details are in the Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15  Launched in April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator is a groundbreaking global collaboration to \naccelerate the development and production of, and equitable access to, COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. \nIt is organized into four pillars: diagnostics, treatment (therapeutics), vaccines, and health system strengthening \n(WHO. COVAX). Each pillar is vital to the overall effort and involves innovation and collaboration (WHO. The Access \nto COVID-19 Tools Accelerator). \n \n ", "6   \n \n(ii) partnering with technical experts, such as in UNICEF, who have extensive experience in \nvaccine  deployment  and  procurement;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) through capacity building and regular training. The rollout of the current \nCOVID-19 vaccination program in the Kyrgyz Republic and other countries has also underscored \nthe need to address vaccine hesitancy aggressively through targeted communications and \noutreach once vaccination progresses, and the value of maintaining flexibility and adapting \nrapidly to the country context. Countries facing limited supplies also need to consider multiple \nchannels for vaccine procurement; and the value of going through well-established channels such \nas COVAX and UNICEF, which may be able to negotiate better prices, terms, and delivery \nschedules because of economies of scale.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n18.  The project responds to the government\u2019s request for ADB support under APVAX to help \nmeet the COVID-19 vaccine response challenges. Following the guidance in Appendix 5 of the \nAPVAX policy, the rapid response component will support the procurement of vaccines and the \nproject  investment  component  will  support  project  implementation.  The  rapid  response \ncomponent will be financed through a concessional loan and grant, while the project investment \ncomponent will only be financed by the grant.  \n \n19.  Impacts and outcome. The project is aligned with the following impact: the spread of \nCOVID-19 reduced and confidence of citizens restored.16 The project\u2019s outcome is priority \npopulations vaccinated against COVID-19.17 The project outputs are described in paras. 20\u201321. \n \n20.  Output  1:  COVID-19  vaccines  procured  and  delivered  to  designated  points.  \nUnder the rapid response component, the project plans to finance vaccine procurement with \nUNICEF as the procurement agent, through a turnkey service either through COVAX or directly \nand, possibly, through bilateral agreements. The project will support the procurement of about \n1.7 million doses, which will be sufficient to vaccinate more than 0.76 million people or about 12% \nof  the  population  (assuming  two  doses  per  person).  The  expenditure  items  will  include \n(i) vaccines that meet the eligibility requirements of the APVAX policy,18 including advance \npayments;  (ii) safety  boxes,  syringes,  and  other  ancillary  items  required  to  administer  the \nvaccines; and (iii) international and national logistics and related services required to transport \nvaccines from the place of purchase to national, regional, and district health facilities.   \n \n21.  Output 2: Vaccination program implementation capacity strengthened. Under the \nproject investment component, the output will help strengthen the MOHSD\u2019s capacity to manage \nthe procurement and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines effectively and efficiently. The capacity-\nstrengthening activities will be coordinated with the existing emergency assistance project and \nregional technical assistance under the CAREC framework to support information and knowledge \nsharing with other CAREC member countries.19 Consultant support will be provided to strengthen \nthe PIU in project management and coordination, procurement, financial management and \ndisbursement, gender mainstreaming, monitoring and evaluation, performance and financial \naudits, and a satisfaction survey among vaccine recipients. Local logistics and the transport of \nvaccines may be covered as required. \n \n16 ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Support to Enhance COVID-19 Vaccine Access.

The project is integral to ADB\u2019s support for the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response. ADB provided $50 million through the COVID-19 Active Response and \nExpenditure Support Program20 and the $20 million COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency Project in \n2020 (para. 11 and footnote 11). For the immediate procurement of medical supplies and PPE for \nhealth care staff, ADB provided about $1 million sourced from regional technical assistance.21 A \nregional health security project in the pipeline for 2022 will build on ADB\u2019s health sector program \nand promote comprehensive sector-wide reforms. Since the Kyrgyz Republic is an open economy \nand serves as a key node in an international transport network in Central Asia, the project will \ngenerate  significant  regional  public  goods  by  reducing  COVID-19  transmission  and \ncomplementing efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and support growth in the CAREC \nregion, through addressing pandemic risks and cross-border health threats. The proposed project \nis  aligned  with  the  CAREC  2030  Strategic  Framework  and  the  upcoming  CAREC  Health \nStrategy.22 \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n23.  The project is estimated to cost $27.6 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).23 \nThe major expenditure items of the project are the purchase and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, \ngoods, and consulting services to strengthen the MOHSD\u2019s capacity. \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Debt sustainability analysis. The debt sustainability analysis indicates that despite the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and the resulting rise in gross financing needs,24 the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \npublic debt remains sustainable and at moderate risk of debt distress for both external and \ndomestic debt. With the gradual fading of the pandemic and economic recovery during 2021\u2013\n2026, the present value of the public debt\u2013GDP ratio will remain well below the debt threshold of \n70% and stabilize around 51% of GDP by 2026. The analysis points out that while the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s capacity to repay its external debt obligations remains adequate, public debt would \ncontinue to rise in the long run without consolidation measures. External debt ratios are also \nprojected to remain well under their respective thresholds. Under the baseline scenario, the \nexternal debt remains at moderate risk of debt distress. It is, however, vulnerable to GDP growth \nand export shocks. Nevertheless, all the debt\u2013GDP ratios under the baseline and alternative \nscenarios show a downward trajectory before 2031.   \n \n27.  The proposed loan of $12.5 million, on broadly concessional terms, represents only 0.2% \nof the country\u2019s outstanding public debt stock of $6.8 billion in 2020. While providing critical \ncountercyclical support to the economy, it will not significantly affect the debt ratio and will not add \nsignificantly to the annual debt service obligations facing the government. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  Project  organization  structure.  The  MOHSD  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The \nimplementing unit will be the current PIU under ADB\u2019s emergency assistance project, which will \nbe augmented with consultants. The deputy minister of health will be the project director. The \nproject director will be supported by the PIU, which will oversee day-to-day implementation. The \nkey PIU staff will be selected competitively and financed by the project under the recurrent cost \ncategory. An auditing firm (financial and performance) will be engaged to ensure comprehensive \nfiduciary assurance to ADB on the overall project delivery.

The project will be guided by the directives of the Republican \nHeadquarters for Prevention of the Spread of COVID-19. The MOHSD has the overall mandate \nto implement the NVDP. Development partners such as ADB, Gavi, UNICEF, WHO, and the \nWorld Bank will meet regularly to ensure timely implementation of the NVDP. Well-established \ncountrywide institutional mechanisms will be used to execute the vaccination plan. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  30 November 2021\u201330 June 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2023 \nEstimated loan and grant  31 December 2023 \nclosing date \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Republican Headquarters for the Prevention of the Spread of COVID-19 \nPrime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic (chair)  \nRepresentatives of all ministries and state agencies (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Health and Social Development  \n(iii)  Implementing agency  Ministry of Health and Social Development \n(iv)  Implementing unit  Project implementation unit of the COVID-19 Emergency Response Project \nProcurement  Direct contracting to manufacturers,  Multiple contracts  $21.800 million \nUNICEF, or COVAX Facility for vaccine \nsupply and ancillary items \nRFQ (ICT equipment)  1 contract  $0.100 million \nConsulting services   Individual consultants (PIU staff)  Multiple contracts  $0.100 million \n  RFQ (public relations firm)  1 contract  $0.025 million \nSSS (auditing firm: financial and  1 contract  $0.100 million \nperformance audit) \nRetroactive financing and/or  Loan and grant funds may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures incurred before \nadvance contracting  effectiveness, subject to a maximum amount equivalent to 30% of the loan and grant \namount, if expenditures are incurred before project effectiveness but after the \ndeclaration of the COVID-19 emergency or allocation of resources but not earlier than \n12 months before the date of the loan and grant agreements, and disbursement \nconditions are met. \nIssuing (i) invitations for bids for RFQ, and (ii) consulting services recruitment notices \nunder advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval.  \nDisbursement   Disbursement of the loan and grant proceeds will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nbetween the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVAX = COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, \nICT = information and communication technology, PIU = project implementation unit, RFQ = request for quotations, \nSSS = single source selection, UNICEF = United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s standard due diligence requirements for processing sovereign operations have \nbeen applied. \n \nA.   Economic and Financial Analysis \n \n31.  The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis, causing loss of lives \nand a major economic downturn arising from the introduction of containment measures that \nrestrict economic activities and an economy-wide slowdown in investment and international trade. \n \n ", "10   \n \nReducing morbidity and mortality will create an enabling environment for the return of normal \ncross-border activities, contributing to economic growth. A project financial viability assessment \nwas not undertaken since project outputs are not meant to produce direct revenue and basic \npublic health services are provided in Kyrgyz Republic free of charge.  \n \n32.  The project team undertook an analysis of historical and projected health sector budget \nallocations, as well as their use by the MOHSD, to assess the financial capability of the MOHSD \nto implement, operate, and maintain the project in a financially sustainable manner. Annual health \nsector spending was relatively stable during 2016\u20132019, when measured as a share of the state \nbudget. Government funding for the health sector increased marginally during this time. Health \nsector spending increased notably in 2020, reflecting government efforts to address the COVID-\n19 pandemic. While the government\u2019s health sector budget allocation for 2021 dropped to a level \nnot seen since 2016 because of the fiscal impact of the pandemic, external funding in 2021 will \nenable total health sector spending to exceed pre-pandemic levels. The government\u2019s medium-\nterm expenditure plan includes an increase in government funding for 2022\u20132024. Considering \nthat the project does not involve the purchase of new assets, projected midterm expenditures \nshow that adequate financing is expected to be available for the MOHSD to maintain existing \nservice levels and ensure adequate asset maintenance. The current NVDP is fully funded. The \nMOHSD may update the NVDP to increase the number of people targeted for vaccination (e.g., \nstudents),  authorize  booster  shots,  and  revise  cost  assumptions  and  commitments  from \ndevelopment partners, which could result in a financing gap.  \n \nB.   Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n \n33.  The government has a relatively comprehensive anticorruption legal framework in place, \ncomprising a dedicated law and the Criminal Code as well as laws on asset declaration and \nconflict of interest. The Law on State Civil Service and Municipal Service, 2016 (as amended) \naims to ensure efficiency in the public service as well as the stability and independence of \nprofessional office activities; and the Law on the Protection of Persons Reporting Corruption \nOffenses,  2019  provides  whistleblower  protection.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOHSD. The \nrisk assessment and risk management plan (Table 5) includes governance-related risks and \nmitigating measures, developed with inputs from ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. \n \nC.   Environment and Social Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n35.  Environment (category C). The COVID-19 vaccination will result in a temporary increase \nin hazardous health care waste (e.g., used syringes, needles, and PPE) at service points. The \nmanagement of incremental waste generated from this activity will be monitored by the PIU to \nensure adequate implementation of the standard operating procedure.25 \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project does not \nentail any physical intervention that would cause involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous \npeoples. \n \n \n25 Environment Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "  11 \n \nD.   Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  Poverty  and  social  considerations.  The  project  supports  reducing  poverty  with \nmeasures to safeguard health to allow people to resume their livelihoods.26 Overall food security \nF\ndeteriorated during the pandemic, with rising numbers of people reporting going hungry, reducing \ndietary diversity, worrying about obtaining enough food, being less able to pay for utilities, and \ncoping by selling assets and reducing spending on medical care. The government recognizes the \nurgent need for vaccination, especially for vulnerable people, to reduce poverty, improve food \nsecurity, and enable economic growth. By reducing the load on the health system, the project will \nimprove COVID-19 management capacity and responsiveness, treatment quality, and survival \nrates. \n \n38.  Gender. Women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and globally. Slightly more men (73%) than women (69%) are aware of COVID-19 \nvaccines.27 Misinformation, such as the impacts on fertility, can lead to reduced access to \nvaccination  for  women.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will \ncontribute to (i) improving access to information to address vaccine hesitancy and limited \nawareness of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, the benefits of vaccination, and safe post-\nvaccination care procedures through a gender-sensitive communication plan; (ii) enhancing \ngender sensitivity in capacity-building activities for health care workers, staff of vaccination \ncenters and mobile clinics, and other personnel involved in the vaccination program to help them \nadminister the vaccines in a culturally appropriate way that respects beneficiaries\u2019 gender, class, \nand beliefs; (iii) developing a sex-disaggregated database of the priority groups for vaccination; \n(iv) updating the guidelines and budget for mobile teams to ensure access to vaccination services \nfor people in remote areas and people with mobility restrictions; and (v) assessing gender-\nsensitive approaches to vaccination through a satisfaction survey on the vaccinated population. \nThe services of mobile teams are valuable to women in remote areas; women providing home \ncare for household members with disability; and older persons, most of whom are women. \nVaccination can benefit women by allowing the resumption of social and economic activity. \n \nE.  Financial Due Diligence  \n \n39.  Financial management. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk of the \nproject is substantial partly because of the risks associated with weaknesses in accounting and \ninternal controls, the exclusion of the project from the Ministry of Economy and Finance\u2019s internal \naudit plan, fiduciary risks related to insufficient vaccine supplies, vaccine hesitancy, inefficient \ninventory and supply chain management, inadequate health sector staffing and cold chain \ncapacity, and a paper-based vaccine supply chain management system. A time-bound financial \nmanagement action plan has been agreed between ADB and the government to address these \nweaknesses. The ongoing emergency assistance project has been reporting regularly on the \nimplementation of the previous financial management action plan, and the only concern is \nregarding  the  delayed  submission  of  audited  project  financial  statements.  Risk  mitigation \nmeasures mainly include the annual conduct of (i) a performance audit of vaccine inventory \nmanagement activities, (ii) the preparation of a financial management manual, (iii) the preparation \nof an accountability policy, (iv) an internal audit of the project and strengthened monitoring and \nevaluation on an ongoing basis, and (v) digitalization of the vaccine logistics and management \ninformation system. \n \n26 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n27 CAREC Institute. 2021.

Procurement will be undertaken in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).28 \nFollowing the APVAX policy (footnote 1), universal procurement will apply. UNICEF is expected \nto be engaged through direct contracting as a turnkey procurement agent to handle all aspects \nof goods and logistics procurement either through COVAX or directly with manufacturers. Goods \nand logistics services will be procured following UNICEF\u2019s Supply Manual.29 The use of direct \ncontracting as the procurement method is justified since most vaccine contracts are being \nentered into globally through UNICEF under COVAX. UNICEF has the resources to provide \nservices immediately through COVAX and is best positioned to navigate the quickly evolving \nvaccine market. UNICEF has been procuring for the routine immunization program of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  is  well  positioned  to  handle  in-country  logistics,  and  UNICEF\u2019s  cold  chain \nexperience  is  critical  for  the  safe  handling  of  vaccines.  Bilateral  contracts  with  approved \nmanufacturers may also be considered.  \n \n41.  Procurement due diligence found that the procurement risk is high. To mitigate this risk, \nADB will support the executing agency with market intelligence; assist the government to prepare \nfor negotiations with vaccine manufacturers; and, as part of its normal procurement review \nmandate for vaccine contracts, identify legal risks in proposed contracts, support with price \nvalidation, and inform the government of any adjustments necessary to render the contracts \nacceptable to ADB. Value for money in procurement will be achieved by (i) selecting candidate \nvaccine  types  that  are  best  suited  to  the  domestic  logistics  supply  chain  and  distribution \nmechanisms; (ii) identifying vaccines that will meet project disbursement conditions; (iii) engaging \na procurement agent who has direct contact with manufacturers and who can ascertain vaccine \navailability and delivery timelines; and (iv) entering into agreements on terms and conditions that \nare reasonable, noting the currently constrained global market for vaccines. ADB will only provide \nfinancing for vaccine procurement once the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria have been met \n(footnote 18). \n \n42.  WHO has prequalified all cold chain equipment, from the national to the district level. The \nMOHSD  will  handle  all  other  procurement  requirements  (Table  4)  following  the  approved \nprocurement plan in the PAM. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n43.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 Considering that risks and the required \nmitigation measures will evolve as vaccines are rolled out, ADB will work with the MOHSD and \nother development partners on monitoring the rollout of the vaccines and mitigation measures. \n \n28 APVAX Strategic Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 ADB. 2010.
