The National Science Technology Authority 1 (NSTA) of the Office of the Prime Minister \nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto support the piloting of e-centers in rural areas to help reduce the urban-rural digital divide. \nBased on stakeholder consultations, the focus will be on the health sector, which is one of the \nfour priority sectors of the Government and supported by ADB. The technical assistance2 (TA) \nwill demonstrate the use of e-centers3 in rural health facilities to improve the skills of health staff \nand  to  promote  health  in  rural  communities.4 The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Lao PDR has made significant progress in reducing poverty. However, rural areas \nare lagging with a poverty incidence of 41% compared with 29% in urban areas. In its Sixth \nNational Socio-economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010), the Government gives high priority to \nreducing rural poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals by improving health \nservices in rural areas.  \n \n3.  The Government has built a rural network of health staff in district hospitals, health \ncenters, village health workers, and increasingly peer educators, for delivering health services to \nsmall and scattered populations. While support systems are in place, communication problems, \nespecially  during  the  rainy  season,  result  in  health  staff,  village  health  workers,  and  peer \neducators working in relative isolation. The provincial capacity for providing quality in-service \ntraining  and  skills-training  materials  for  rural  health  workers  is  limited.  Consequently,  the \nMinistry of Health (MOH) is seeking to strengthen health promotion and primary health care \nworker skills through information and communications technology (ICT)-based training. Many \nrural health staff, village health workers, and peer educators could benefit from e-centers in \nnearby hospitals and health centers.  \n \n4.  The Government gives high priority to promoting ICT in rural areas to offer residents \nbetter access to information. Since 2003, the Government has been expanding access to \ninformation and the internet through public-private partnerships. High-speed internet services \nare available in most provincial headquarters, and district towns and health centers along the \nmain roads have access to dial-up services. However, assistance with the initial provision of \nequipment and training is needed, and services need to be managed and sustained. Given the \nincreasing provincial ICT infrastructure and support capacity, expansion into rural areas is \nincreasingly possible.  \n \n5.  Despite substantial interest from the Government and partners, little external assistance \nis available to promote rural ICT. ADB has supported a regional technical assistance\u2014the Asian \nDevelopment Community Broadcasting Initiative, which piloted satellite broadcasting to improve \naccess to information on the risks of HIV/AIDS among ethic groups in northern Lao PDR.5 The \n                                                 \n1   Formerly the Science, Technology and Environment Agency. \n2  Concept clearance was obtained on 15 June 2007.   \n3  E-centers  are  an  outlet  for  providing  the  general  public  with  affordable  access  using  information  and \ncommunication technology, such as the internet, e-mail, computer training, distance learning, online services, and \nother kinds of services and information beneficial to the community. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 July 2007. \n5  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Greater Mekong Subregion for HIV/AIDS Vulnerability and Risk Reduction \namong Ethnic Minority Groups through Communication Strategies. Manila. \n ", "2     \nassistance  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  using  local  languages  to  improve  the \nunderstanding  of  health  issues.  The  United  Nations  Education,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization is establishing a community multimedia center6 in the Lao PDR. Experiences \nelsewhere suggest that e-centers such as those being developed under the regional rural  \ne-development initiative in South Asia7 are in high demand in rural communities.  \n  \n6.  ADB is well suited as a partner for the Lao PDR to explore the potential of e-centers in \nrural health facilities as this TA builds upon and complements other ADB supported initiatives in \nLao PDR. ADB\u2019s Primary Health Care Expansion Project8 has helped expand health services in \nthe eight northern provinces by constructing hospitals and health centers and training health \nstaff, village health workers, and peer educators many with an ethnic minority background. \nDifferent types of staff could greatly benefit from ICT-based training to upgrade their skills. The \nrecently approved Health System Development Project9 will help improve service delivery in the \nsector and can support ICT initiatives for several years. \n \n7.  A substantial amount of health education content is already available. In particular, \nunder ADB\u2019s Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project that \naddresses regional risks and challenges in communicable diseases control,10 an interactive CD-\nROM11 on immunization was produced for training health staff. The CD provides a highly skill-\noriented  but  user-friendly  set  of  audiovisual  tools  to  upgrade  the  capability  of  health  staff \nthrough self instruction and could be used as a template for similar CDs on topics such as  \n(i) maternal and child health and nutrition; (ii) control of communicable diseases; and (iii) village \nhealth  worker  skills  in  basic  curative,  preventive,  and  promotive  care.  These  and  other \nexperiences will be used in developing content for e-centers. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA is improved health in rural communities. The outcome is improved \nquality and utilization of health staff and village health workers, and increased use of ICT \nservices.  \n \nB.  Outputs  \n9.  The TA will (i) develop e-center networks with ICT access and facilities in two rural \nprovinces, (ii) develop practical health information and skills training for rural health staff and \ncommunities through e-health services, (iii) build local capacity in ICT use and sustainable \noperation  of  e-centers  in  rural  communities,  and  (iv)  monitor  and  evaluate  activities  and \noutcome. The TA will be implemented in 16 district hospitals and health centers in the pilot \nprovinces of Savannakhet and Xieng Khouang.  The 16 sites will be determined in collaboration \n                                                 \n6  The community multimedia center combines community radio with community telecenter facilities.  \n7  ADB. 2005.

Output 1: Development of e-Center Networks. In each targeted province, the TA will \nsupport the establishment of a small network with an e-center in four district hospitals and four \nhealth centers with internet dial-up connections that can also connect to the provincial health \noffice and hospital. The TA will also support the contracting of a private internet service provider \n(ISP)  to  operate  and  maintain  the  network  in  cooperation  with  NSTA.  A  website  will  be \ndeveloped for the pilot to upload and update health-related content and services, as well as to \ndisseminate other relevant information. The users of the e-centers will be charged small fee on \na revolving fund basis similar to the drug revolving fund to cover the costs of the telephone \ncharges and ISP.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Development of e-Health Content and Services. Output 2 will support the \ndevelopment of e-health content and applications of e-health services to improve access to \nhealth information and quality of district and subdistrict services in rural areas. E-health content \nwill be developed based on the needs of (i) health staff at district hospitals and health centers \nfor skills training, and (ii) village health workers and peer educators in local communities for \nbasic health information. Output 2 will primarily support the development of user-friendly CD-\nROMs that contain videos, graphics, and interactive questions and answers accompanied by \ntranscripts and manuals. Three separate CDs are expected to be produced on (i) maternal and \nchild health and nutrition; (ii) control of communicable diseases; and (iii) village health worker \nskills in basic curative, preventive, and promotive care. In addition, other health information will \nbe adapted for uploading onto the website. The content will be based on existing MOH policies, \nguidelines, and standards; adapted to a local context; and translated into local languages. The \nTA will enable health workers to communicate with and seek advice from the provincial health \nstaff, and report disease outbreaks and services.  \n \n12.  Output 3: Capacity Building. Output 3 will support three types of capacity building \nprograms: (i) ICT-based health education and skill training for health staff in district hospitals \nand  health  centers,  village  health  workers,  and  peer  educators;  (ii)  training  of  e-center \nfacilitators with regard to sustainable operation and maintenance of the e-center; and (iii) basic \ncomputer literacy training for health staff in district hospitals and health centers, village health \nworkers, and peer educators. About 250 people will participate in various training programs. \n \n13.  Output 4: Monitoring and Evaluation. All three outputs of the TA will be carefully \nmonitored and evaluated to assess the outcome of the e-center network and ICT applications in \nimproved quality and utilization of health workers and village health workers, and increased use \nof ICT services.  \n \n14.  Expected Results and Deliverables. The TA will result in (i) a piloted network of eight \ne-centers in each of the two pilot provinces; (ii) interactive CD-ROMs for health promotion and \nskills training for e-health services with local content; (iii) operationalized and well-managed  \ne-centers;  (iv)  documented  key  lessons  from  evaluation  of  e-centers  and  e-health  service \nimplementation; (v) a website for e-health content and dissemination; (vi) improved ICT literacy \nfor  health  staff  in  district  hospitals  and  health  centers,  village  health  workers,  and  peer \neducators; and (vii) better understanding of targeted health services and practices. \n \n ", "4     \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 including government contributions. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund. ADB will administer the $500,000 grant. The Government of the Lao PDR will \nprovide $100,000 as in-kind contribution. The cost and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will take the role of Executing Agency, while NSTA and MOH will be implementing \nagencies. NSTA will be the lead agency responsible for developing and implementing outputs 1, \n3, and 4 and for the overall project outcomes. MOH will be responsible for developing and \nimplementing output 2, and facilitating smooth implementation of the project in health facilities. \nNSTA will work in close partnership with MOH and provincial health offices, and set up a small \nsteering committee including MOH representatives to oversee TA implementation.  \n \n17.  A project management unit will be set up in NSTA with the deputy director general, \nDepartment of Science and Technology, as the project director. NSTA will appoint a focal point \nfrom both the Savannakhet and Xieng Khouang provincial NSTA offices to coordinate provincial \nactivities under the guidance of the project director. The NSTA provincial offices will provide \nsupport to the pilot e-centers and be responsible for ongoing support. The deputy director of the \nCabinet of MOH will be the project director for MOH, and MOH\u2019s Centre for Information and \nEducation for Health will be a key partner for the development of health information for the CD-\nROMs and the website. MOH will mobilize its provincial, district, and subdistrict health services \nstaff to support implementation in the pilot communities.  \n \n18.  Training. NSTA will be responsible for coordinating and delivering training activities. \nBasic computer literacy training will be provided through face-to-face and CD-ROM delivery to \nhealth staff in district hospitals and health centers, village health workers, and peer educators to \nenable them to effectively access the e-health education material.  \n \n19.  During a 1 month inception period, the TA team comprising assigned Government staff  \nand consultants will review relevant government policies and plans and lessons from various \nprojects; and conduct consultations with NSTA, ministries, the Primary Health Care Expansion \nProject team, development partners in Vientiane, provincial officials and staff, and potential \nbeneficiaries. These inputs will be used to identify key issues and prepare an implementation \nplan. The team leader will submit an inception report describing progress in establishing the \nteams and implementation plan. Quarterly progress reports and a midterm report will also be \nsubmitted. The draft final report will be submitted after 16 months, and a final report and \nimplementation memorandum on completion of the TA.
