At the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in \nDhaka, Bangladesh, in 2005, SAARC leaders agreed on the need for the group to \u201cbroaden its \nengagement  with  civil  society  organizations,  professional  groups  and  entrepreneurs  in  the \nregion.\u201d However, public opinion and the overall climate for regional cooperation remain weak. \nThis lack of adequately positive climate in favor of regional cooperation could be addressed by \nindependent and reputable research institutes and think tanks in the region as the work done by \nthese bodies highlights the benefits of regional cooperation and thus influences public opinion \nand the thinking of political leaders. There appears to be a need for some greater attention to be \ngiven to strengthening the capability of research institutes, think tanks and experts, and to \npromoting effective networking among them for strengthening regional cooperation. Enhancing \nanalytical  and  research  capabilities  and  establishing  an  effective  network  among  research \norganizations  are  generally  referred  to  as  \u201ctrack  two\u201d  measures  to  distinguish  them  from \nmeasures directed at governments and public sector agencies. The output from studies by \nresearch institutes, think tanks and experts will contribute toward molding public opinion and \ncould  be  expected  to  influence  positively  the  views  of  leaderships  in  the  region,  thereby \ncontributing to stronger political will for regional cooperation. In addition, the report of the \nEminent Persons Group1 highlights the importance of ADB\u2019s role as a platform for sharing \ninformation  about  knowledge  management  activities  in  terms  of  regional  know-how.  The \nproposed regional technical assistance (RETA) responds to requests by developing member \ncountries (DMCs) at several meetings, including ADB\u2019s annual meeting in Kyoto, Japan, from 5 \nto 7 May 2007. The RETA was not included in the South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy \nand Program (RCSP) 2006\u20132008, but the concept paper for the RETA was cleared on 18 July \n2007 by the Vice President, Operations 1. During a fact-finding mission from 30 August to 3 \nSeptember 2007, major research institutes in South Asia were consulted and agreed with the \nproposed RETA. The RETA design and monitoring framework is shown in Appendix 1.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n 2.   Most  South  Asian  countries  have  fairly  well  developed  and  analytically  oriented \nresearch institutes, think tanks and experts. Many of these undertake studies related specifically \nto regional cooperation, and their work is beginning to have a positive impact as policy makers \nin the region develop greater appreciation of the benefits of regional cooperation. However, the \nactivities in conducting research and disseminating findings remain somewhat limited. In view of \nthe significant role that regional cooperation can potentially play in accelerating the pace of \ndevelopment and reducing poverty in South Asia, the activities of research institutes, think tanks \nand experts need to be strengthened further by supporting (i) a timely and enhanced scope of \nanalytical  work  on  regional  cooperation  activities,  and  (ii)  wider  dissemination  of  research \nfindings to encourage policy recommendations being put into practice.  \n \n3.  In 2004 ADB undertook a regional small scale technical assistance (SSTA) to promote \nregional cooperation in South Asia, by facilitating \u201ctrack two\u201d measures to enhance the capacity \nof  research  institutes  in  South  Asia.3  Through  the  SSTA,  ADB  has  promoted  regional \ncooperation by (i) strengthening current initiatives and networks of research institutes, and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Toward a New Asian Development Bank in a New Asia: Report of the Eminent Persons Group to the \nPresident of the Asian Development Bank.

Technical Assistance for Supporting Network of Research Institutes and Think Tanks in South Asia. \nManila (TA 6189-REG, approved on 30 September 2007). \n ", "2   \nenhancing the scope of analytical work undertaken; (ii) increasing interaction among regional \nexperts;  and  (iii)  widening  the  dissemination  of  research  material  that  supports  regional \ncooperation. Positive evaluation of the \u201ctrack two\u201d measures to promote regional cooperation \nand integration (RCI), and further recent positive developments in cooperation in the SAARC \nregion,  under  the  SSTA,  led  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Department  (SARD)  to  conduct  several \nadditional activities for the SAARC summit in New Delhi, India, in April 2007. SAARC also \nprioritizes knowledge sharing among its member countries. For example, leaders at the latest \nsummit agreed to the vision of a South Asian community where goods, services, peoples, \ntechnologies, knowledge, capital, culture and ideas flow smoothly around the region.4\n \n4.  The SSTA has successfully conducted five studies on specialized topics and supported \nfour workshop or seminars on regional cooperation. This includes inputs for the SAARC summit, \nundertaken by the South Asian Centre of Policy Studies, one of the most established networks \nof research institutes in the region. The SSTA also supported the eighth annual conference of \nthe  South  Asia  Network  of  Economic  Research  Institutes,  also  a  well-established  regional \nnetwork, which was held in Kathmandu, Nepal, from 31 August to 1 September 2007. The \nconference covered a variety of topics including foreign direct investment, human resource \ndevelopment, and development of the financial and agriculture sectors. \n \n5.  These  seminars  and  studies  succeeded  in  raising  awareness  about  key  areas  of \nregional cooperation such as investment cooperation, energy cooperation, South Asia\u2019s strategy \nfor World Trade Organization negotiations, the South Asian Free Trade Area, macroeconomic \npolicy harmonization, and a Citizens\u2019 Charter for South Asia. However, such initiatives need to \nbe enhanced further in order to gain broader socio-political support for regional cooperation. \nThe current favorable environment provides an opportunity to push the regional cooperation \nagenda further. ADB\u2019s unique and close involvement with sub-regional cooperation initiatives \nputs it in a strong position to take the process further by assisting to build broad consensus for \ncooperation initiatives through activities to be undertaken by research institutes in the region. \n \n6.  During the SSTA\u2019s implementation, research institutes, think tanks and experts in South \nAsia proposed many useful, practical and constructive research plans and related workshops to \npromote regional cooperation, including policy recommendations. They have since requested \nmore timely and wider-scale support from ADB to (i) develop a medium-term framework to \npromote their research activities and \u201ctrack two\u201d measures, (ii) enhance their research capacity, \nand (iii) further develop research networks in South Asia. In the coming years, these research \ninstitutes, with capacity to conduct useful research, including addressing policy implications and \nmaking recommendations, plan to undertake many important studies on regional cooperation. \nThese studies need to be completed and delivered through publications and workshops in a \ntimely manner. They will be built on lessons of the SSTA and other regional cooperation \nactivities. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The proposed RETA will promote regional economic cooperation in South Asia through \nknowledge sharing on RCI and policy making for RCI, and enhance the capacity of research \ninstitutes  in  South  Asian  DMCs  through  studies,  workshops  and  dissemination  of  the \n                                                 \n4  SAARC. 2007.  Declaration of the Fourteenth SAARC Summit. New Delhi. \n ", "  3\noutcomes.5 The RETA will further strengthen existing networks of research institutes in South \nAsia, and facilitate interaction between academics, policy makers and researchers in order to \npromote the \u201ctrack two\u201d measures. The RETA supports research on RCI issues by DMC experts \nas well as existing research institutes and networks in the region. The studies and workshops \nunder the RETA will recommend policies and plans of joint actions to enhance cooperation \namong the SAARC member countries. The studies and workshops may also identify priority \nareas  and  projects  for  which  technical  and  financial  assistance  could  be  provided  by \ndevelopment  partners,  including  ADB,  and  further  facilitate  coordination  of  development \npartners in the region. \n \n8.  The RETA will build knowledge and capacity in specific development topics related to \nregional cooperation. It will help to enhance the understanding and awareness of policy makers \nand the public regarding important regional sectoral and thematic issues. It also will strengthen \nADB\u2019s partnership with local research institutes, think tanks, experts and academia, which will \nfacilitate ADB\u2019s recommendations on regional cooperation.6 The RETA will foster knowledge \ncommunities  throughout  the  region  and  provide  learning  opportunities  on  key  and  priority \ndevelopment topics where ADB\u2019s financial assistance is made available for research in regional \ncooperation. The expected development of research networks may be integrated into ADB\u2019s \nlending operations and knowledge management activities, which is in line with the report of the \nEminent Persons Group to the President proposing ADB as a platform for knowledge sharing \nrather than as the primary source of knowledge. In addition, the network will support DMCs in \ntheir development efforts and enhance ADB\u2019s ability to respond to their needs more effectively \nand in a timely manner. Research activities to be proposed will primarily cover regional and \nsubregional  economic  cooperation  programs  on  cross-border  infrastructure  and  related \nsoftware, trade and investment cooperation and integration, and cooperation in regional public \ngoods, which are three of four pillars in ADB\u2019s RCI strategy.7  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  RETA  will  identify  two  research  institute  networks  in  the  region  to  serve  as \ncoordinating centers for specific research topics particularly related to regional cooperation, to \nbe financed under the assistance. The networks should have the technical skills and capacity to \nundertake these activities and to influence policy makers to implement their recommendations. \nADB will identify research topics and research institute networks through internal consultation \namong relevant departments, the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI), DMCs and other \nstakeholders.  Research  networks  will  consult  and  coordinate  with  their  regional  network \ninstitutes  on  the  details  of  research  activities.  They  will  advertise  the  details  of  research \nactivities  to  be  financed  through  their  networks  on  their  websites  in  order  to  encourage \nadditional collaboration and support from experts in the region. These coordinating centers will \nhold  workshops  on  related  topics  to  disseminate  research  outcomes.  To  ensure  effective \nsynergy  and  knowledge  sharing,  research  networks  and  their  member  institutes  will \ncommunicate with each other as much as possible. To further promote regional cooperation and \nintegration  through  \u201ctrack  two\u201d  measures,  the  networks  will  also  collaborate  with  existing \nresearch institute networks and governments in the region. In order to build on lessons learnt \nand  find  effective  ways  to  see  relevant  governments  realize  policy  recommendations, \nworkshops to discuss case studies of \u201ctrack two\u201d measures in South Asia and other regions will \nbe held during the early stages of implementing the RETA.  \n                                                 \n5  The RETA will be conducted in SAARC member countries Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, \nNepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \n6  ADB. 2007.

The outputs of the RETA will be a series of operational policy studies and analytical \nworks  on  development  of  RCI  in  South  Asia,  workshops,  seminars  and  conferences,  and \ndissemination  of  the  findings  of  these  studies  through  publication  and  the  internet.  The \nworkshops will involve a variety of stakeholders, including representatives of the private sector, \nto facilitate dissemination of the findings and effectively influence policy makers. A set of papers \nand studies will be generated by local research institutes that are members of a research \nnetwork in SAARC member countries. The studies will cover regional cooperation in areas such \nas  transport,  trade  and  investment,  energy,  macroeconomic  policies,  health  and  migration \nissues, many of which are priority sectors in the South Asia RCSP 2006\u20132008. Each network of \nresearch institutes, working as a coordinating center, will be asked to conduct a stocktaking \nstudy of research activities for each sector to avoid redundant work and identify research topics \nin each area. \n \n11.  In addition to supporting two research institute networks, a portion of research grant \nfunds will be available to research institutes in the region that are not already part of the \nnetworks. Competitive research grants, open to all research institutes and experts in the region, \nwill be developed and implemented to promote research on regional cooperation by research \ninstitutes, think tanks and experts from SAARC countries. A steering committee8 will receive \nand select proposals to be financed by grants. For research proposals under coordinating \ncenters and competitive research grants, a template for proposals and evaluation criteria will be \ndeveloped to ensure a uniform process. \n \n12.  Synergies with ADBI will be explored in the design of workshops and the selection of \nstudies to be conducted.9 The RETA also will explore opportunities for cooperation with the \nresearch and training institutes of other multilateral institutions such as the World Bank Institute. \nThe RETA will build on the lessons and extensive experience of other subregional cooperation \nprograms, such as the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Program, the GMS Phnom Penh Plan \nfor Development Management, the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nProgram, the CAREC Capacity Development for Regional Cooperation in CAREC Participating \nCountries,10 studies, workshops and training courses conducted by the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration and the SSTA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The  total  cost  of  the  proposed  RETA,  estimated  at  $1,200,000  equivalent,  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  costs  will cover  consulting \nservices,  regional  conferences,  the  research  program  and  publication.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates for the proposed RETA are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency of the RETA. ADB\u2019s SARD will be responsible for \noverall administration of the assistance. The RETA is expected to begin in December 2007 and \nbe  completed  by  December  2010.  The  selected  networks  of  research  institutes  will  be \nimplementing agencies. No activities will be financed under this RETA in any member country of \n                                                 \n8  See paragraph 15 of this paper. \n9  ADBI held an Asian think tanks workshop in June 2007.  \n10 ADB. 2006.
