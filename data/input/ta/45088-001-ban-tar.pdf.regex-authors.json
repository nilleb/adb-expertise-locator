INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide capacity development support to the Bangladesh Bank. An \nADB mission visited Dhaka in March 2011 and finalized, in consultation with the senior staff of \nthe Bangladesh Bank, the technical assistance (TA) impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants.1 The TA is \nconsistent with ADB strategy to support the government\u2019s effort to deepen and diversify the \nfinance  sector, make  it  more  efficient,  and  strengthen money  market  governance  and  the \nregulatory environment. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 has reopened the debate about the contours \nof monetary management by the central banks in avoiding systemic risk. The crisis raises two \npolicy challenges for central banks: (i) how to modify monetary policy strategic frameworks to \nbetter prevent or mitigate the effects of financial crises and (ii) how to adjust central bank \noperational frameworks to cope with future crises.2 The use of a broad-based monetary policy \nstrategic framework, supported by forward-looking indicators, has proven to be key to effectively \nmanaging challenges to monetary and financial stability in an uncertain environment. In general, \nthe three main monetary policy objectives in a broad-based monetary policy strategic framework \nare  (i)  price  stability,  (ii)  gross  domestic  product  growth,  and,  more  recently,  (iii) financial \nstability.  The  Bangladesh  Bank,  which  was  set  up  on  16  December  1971,3 reiterated  its \ncommitment to the three broad monetary policy objectives with policy rates\u2014the repo and the \nreverse repo rates\u2014as the main instruments of monetary policy, supported by other indirect \ninstruments such as open market operations and reserve requirements4 The Bangladesh Bank \nhas  sought  ADB  support  in  acquiring  important  building  blocks  encompassing  monetary \nmanagement, systemic risk assessments, and financial sector supervision, supported by a \nlearning-by-doing partnership between international experts and the Bangladesh Bank staff.5  \n \n3.  The Bangladesh Bank lacks adequate capacity in implementing a broad-based monetary \npolicy framework that includes financial system oversight. In the area of conventional monetary \nmanagement, the Bangladesh Bank needs to improve its internal capacity to formulate and \nimplement monetary and exchange rate policy, including strengthening its capacity to monitor \nmarket liquidity based on market expectations about growth and inflation. Similarly, financial \nsystem oversight requires tighter supervision in many areas: (i) sustained improvements in \ninformation collection through market surveys and the use of the stress-testing methodology; (ii) \nimproved  supervision  through  risk-based  supervision,  as  opposed  to  compliance-based \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 July 2011. \n2   International Monetary Fund. 2010.

No. 127 of 1972. \n4  The Bangladesh Bank reiterated its vision in its strategic plan for 2010\u20132014 \u201cto develop continually as a forward-\nlooking central bank with competent and committed professional of high ethical standards, conducting monetary \nmanagement  and  financial  sector  supervision  to  maintain  price  stability  and  financial  system  robustness, \nsupporting rapid broad-based inclusive economic growth, employment generation, and poverty eradication in \nBangladesh.\u201d See also A.

The working paper provides \na detailed discussion on issues pertaining to the operational framework of central banks. \n ", "2   \nsupervision;  and  (iii)  improved  assessment  of  banks\u2019  risk  profiles. 6  Consequently,  the \nBangladesh  Bank  requires  sustained  capacity  development  initiatives  to  carry  out  its  core \nfunctions efficiently. \n \n4.  The Bangladesh Bank has acknowledged that (i) inadequate training, professionalism, \nand a shortage of specialists; (ii) inadequate human resource policy including on training needs \nassessment;  and  (iii)  improper  workload  distribution  causing  dependency  on  only  a  few \nexperienced  staff  may  constrain  the  smooth  conduct  of  monetary  management  and  other \ncentral bank functions.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The impact of the TA will be the improved conduct of monetary policy. The performance \nindicators are (i) a policy paper on an inflation management framework detailing operational \nprocedures in line with the broad monetary policy objectives that go beyond traditional inflation \ntargeting8 and (ii) a framework for finance sector risk management and assessment in place. \nThe outcome of the TA will be strengthened in-house capacity of the Bangladesh Bank, which is \nnecessary to improve the conduct of monetary policy by addressing its multiple objectives. \nThus,  the  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  assessed  by  institutional  structures  and  guidelines \ndeveloped on (i) preparing biannual financial stability reports (FSRs), (ii) carrying out surveys of \nbusiness  and  inflation  expectations  at  regular  intervals,  (iii)  implementing  revised  banking \nregulations in line with international best practices, and (iv) publishing a few well-articulated \npolicy and strategy papers on relevant topics by the Bangladesh Bank staff. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n6.  The TA will support implementing a capacity development plan for the Bangladesh Bank, \nwhich is necessary to improve the conduct of monetary policy in Bangladesh. This will be \nachieved by adopting a comprehensive, two-pronged approach. First, the TA will help the \nBangladesh Bank to improve its internal capacity by providing training to selected staff on \n(i) preparing  high-quality  technical  reports  and  guidelines  covering  conventional  monetary \nmanagement and financial supervision,9 (ii) carrying out the technical analysis and surveys \nnecessary to  prepare these reports  and guidelines; and  (iii)  implementing  new  supervision \n                                                \n6  International Monetary Fund. 2009. Bangladesh: Financial System Stability Assessment. Washington, DC. \n7  Bangladesh Bank. 2009. Strategic Plan: 2010\u20132014. \n8  Inflation targeting is a policy framework designed to stabilize inflation and is based on a monetary policy that \nsupports an announced medium-term inflation target. In pursuing a traditional strategy targeting inflation, countries \ncommit themselves to price stability as the main objective of monetary policy, stipulating that medium- to long-term \ninflation is where an inflation target is set. Policy rates are adjusted in response to deviations in inflation and growth \nfrom their targets. An emphasis on price stability over the long run could be one of the principal goals of monetary \npolicy and monetary policy rules, but targets need to be designed carefully to ensure compatibility with other core \nobjectives.  \n9  The FSR is one such initiative. The purpose of the FSR is to identify at an early stage any vulnerability that could \ncause a crisis in the finance system and to recommend policy measures to address it. Conveying information on \nfinancial stability may be perceived as important to enhancing public understanding of financial stability and \nawareness of the role the central bank can play in ensuring it.  \n ", "  3 \nguidelines.10 Second, the TA will support the dissemination of new initiatives and monetary \nmanagement tools through workshops and conferences. \n \n7.  The outputs of the TA fall into four groups: (i) preparing the FSRs,11 (ii) preparing an \ninflation management framework, (iii) designing new banking supervision guidelines, and (iv) \nupgrading the skills those are crucial for either preparing these reports and frameworks in the \nfuture or for implementing new guidelines. The last group includes (i) designing and carrying out \nsurveys of business and inflation expectations, including producing the reports on the first \nsurveys; (ii) designing a set of macroprudential policies and instruments, which are important for \nimproved financial supervision;12 (iii) implementing regulations on banking supervision; and (iv) \nimproving writing and editing capacity. The TA will further upgrade skills by organizing field and \nexposure training for selected staff in other central banks in the regional countries. \n \n8.  A unique feature of this TA is that the outputs, while guided by international consultants, \nwill  be  joint  products  emanating  from  core  partnerships  and  collaboration  between  the \nconsultants and the staff of the Bangladesh Bank defined across each of the major outputs. This \nwill be important for ensuring full ownership and understanding of TA deliverables by the staff of \nthe Bangladesh Bank, and to ensure the effective rollout and sustainability of these initiatives \nonce the consultants' work is complete. \n \n9.  The effective implementation of the TA crucially hinges on certain major assumptions: (i) \nthe  Bangladesh  Bank\u2019s  long-term  commitment  to  implementing  reforms  in  monetary \nmanagement; (ii) no circumstances such as a banking crisis in the country that would force the \nBangladesh Bank to shift its reform agenda; (iii) necessary human resources, hardware, and \nsoftware  being  made  available  and  maintained  by  the  government;  and  (iv) necessary \ninstitutional arrangements with other central banks being in place for training. Major risks are (i) \nthat the Bangladesh Bank may not sustain long-term capacity to address emerging monetary \npolicy challenges and (ii) that the Bangladesh Bank may be unable to recruit or make suitable \nuse of key staff to work with the consultants toward implementing TA initiatives.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $545,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV).  The remaining $45,000 will be \ncontributed  by  the  government,  which  will  provide  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  office \naccommodation  and  supplies,  transport,  and  other  logistical  support.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n                                                \n10 Redesigning and implementing the banking supervision regulation is one of the tasks in this category, including the \nconsolidated supervision of banking groups. All central banks are still designing recommendations to improve the \nconduct of both prudential supervision and consumer protection.  \n11 A typical FSR starts with an overview of key developments affecting the country\u2019s financial system. This is followed \nby sections that (i) review the provision of financial services in the economy, (ii) identify key risks to the financial \nsystem, (iii) assess the resilience of the system, and (iv) consider policies that can help safeguard stability. FSRs \nneed to be periodic exercises reviewing the nature, magnitude, and implications of risks that have a bearing on the \nmacroeconomic environment, financial institutions, markets, and infrastructure. Thus, proper capacity development \nand training of the trainers are crucial for sustaining this initiative. \n12 Macroprudential policy broadens the perspective of traditional prudential policy away from individual institutions \nand considers a systematic approach to promote sound practices and limit excessive risk-taking in the economy \n(see Bank for International Settlements. 2010. 80th Annual Report. Basel). \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The Bangladesh Bank will be the executing agency for the TA. Implementation will be \nsupervised by a steering committee chaired by the deputy governor dealing with monetary \npolicy. The Bangladesh Bank will form the committee before the TA consultants are engaged. A \nproject implementation unit will be set up, also before the consultants are engaged, to supervise \nand  coordinate  the  TA.  The  steering  committee  will  nominate  key  senior  officials  from \nconcerned departments to manage the unit. The executing agency will provide office space, a \nconference/workshop venue, furniture, equipment, and counterpart staff for the TA.  \n \n12.  Twenty person-months of consultancy will be required, 8 person-months international \nand  12 national.  All  consultants  will  be  hired  on  individual  and  intermittent  bases.13 The \ninternational  consultants  will  be  a  monetary  management  specialist  and  a  finance  sector \nspecialist.14 The national consultants will be a survey expert and an economics editor. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Appendix 3 provides the terms of reference. \nMoreover, senior resource persons from central banks will be invited for the conference. All \nprocurement  of  equipment  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and handed over to the executing agency on \nTA completion. Disbursement under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be \nimplemented over 2 years and is expected to commence in September 2011. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Capacity Development for Bangladesh Bank, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n13 The requirements are so diverse and specialized that no single firm is expected to have all required expertise. \n14 The consultants are expected to coordinate closely and draw inputs from another project preparatory TA provided \nby ADB on the development of capital markets in Bangladesh. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved conduct of  An effective inflation  Bangladesh Bank  Necessary long-term \nmonetary policy with  management framework  annual reports  government commitment for \nmultiple objectives,  in place     implementing reforms in \nincluding price and    Economic surveys  monetary management \nfinancial stability   A finance sector risk     \nassessment framework  International  No circumstances such as a \nin place   Monetary Fund  banking crisis in the country \n  reports  forcing the Bangladesh Bank \nAn effective finance    to shift its reform agenda \nsector risk management  Other relevant   \nframework in place   reports and  Risk \n  assessments, e.g.,  The Bangladesh Bank not \nfrom the World  sustaining long-term \nBank  capacity to carry out \n  improved conduct of \nmonetary policy \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened  Fully operationalized  Bangladesh Bank  Necessary human \ncapacity in the  institutional structures  annual reports  resources, hardware, and \nBangladesh Bank  and guidelines by    software maintained in key \nSeptember 2013 for    departments of the \n(i) preparing biannual    Bangladesh Bank. \nfinancial stability reports,   \n(ii) carrying out biannual  Necessary commitment for \nsurveys of business and  change management by the \ninflation expectations,  Bangladesh Bank \n(iii) implementing revised   \nbanking regulations, and  Risks \n(iv) publishing well- The Bangladesh Bank \narticulated policy and  failing to retain key staff to \nstrategy papers on  sustain the reform initiatives \nrelevant topics by the  implemented under the TA \nstaff of the Bangladesh   \nBank   Staff not being given \nopportunities to work in the \nareas in which they have \nbeen trained \nOutputs        \nCapacity       \ndevelopment support       \nfor       \n      Assumptions \n1. preparing financial  First financial stability  Bangladesh Bank  Necessary human \nstability reports,  report   annual reports  resources, hardware, and \n      software made available by \n2. preparing a policy  Policy paper on inflation  ADB reports of  the government \npaper on inflation  management and  monitoring visits   \nmanagement and  targeting     Necessary institutional \ntargeting,      arrangements with other \n    central banks in place for \n3. revising and  Revised banking  training  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nimplementing  regulations manual   Suitable training made \nregulations on    available \nbanking     \nsupervision,    Risk \n    The Bangladesh Bank \n4. carrying out  First results from  failing to recruit or make \nsurveys on  surveys of business and  suitable use of key staff \nbusiness and  inflation expectations   adequately to work with \ninflation    consultants toward \nexpectations,    implementing TA initiatives \n     \n5. designing  First financial stability \nmacroprudential  report  \npolicies and   \ninstruments,   \n   \n6. writing and editing  Editorial manual  \nskills training,   \n   \n7. study tours, and  Reports on study tours  \n   \n   \n8. conference/  Conference volume  \nworkshop \nActivities with Milestones   \n  Inputs \n1.1 Prepare the manual for the financial stability report (January 2012).
