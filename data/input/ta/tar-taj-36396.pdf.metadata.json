During the 2003 Country Programming Mission to Tajikistan, the Government confirmed \nits request for technical assistance (TA) to help prepare a project for the second phase of \nimprovement of the road from Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz border and associated rural roads (the \nProject). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Fact-Finding Mission visited Tajikistan in March \n2004, visited the project area, carried out an initial poverty and social assessment and rapid \nenvironmental  assessment,  and  discussed  project-related  issues  with  Government  officials.  \nAn understanding was reached with the Government on the objectives, scope, costs, terms of \nreference,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TA.1  This  paper  is  based  on  the \nunderstanding reached with the Government and the Mission's observations in the field. The TA \nframework, outlining the goal, purpose, outputs, and inputs, is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Tajikistan is the poorest of the Central Asian republics, with a per capita gross domestic \nproduct of about $184 in 2002 and a poverty incidence of 83% (1999). Average wages are less \nthan $1 per day.2 Economic growth resumed in 1997, following a prolonged decline due to the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union and civil war, and averaged 7.3% per year during 1998\u20132002. \nAgriculture now employs more than 60% of the workforce, including many displaced from urban \njobs. As a landlocked country with a small market, Tajikistan needs access to regional markets \nto achieve sustainable economic growth. \n \n3.  Roads comprise the most important transport mode in Tajikistan, excluding Uzbek transit \ntraffic carried on the railway. The combined length of Tajikistan\u2019s road network is about 26,000 \nkilometers (km), consisting of 4,700 km of national and 21,300 km of local roads. The length of \nthe network is adequate to accommodate existing traffic levels and support economic growth \nand  sustainable  development  in  the  medium  term.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  has \njurisdiction over 13,700 km, including all of the national roads and 42% of the local roads (9,000 \nkm). The remaining 12,300 km of local roads not under MOT jurisdiction are mostly rural and \nfarm  roads.  The  major  part  of  the  network  was  constructed  before  1970,  and  inadequate \nmaintenance and damage from civil conflict and recent natural disasters have left it in a state of \nsevere deterioration. Of the national roads, 42% are asphalt, 50% are other pavement, and 8% \nare gravel. Many of the asphalt roads are in a seriously deteriorated condition, and in many \nplaces the asphalt has been worn away. Of the total roads in Tajikistan, 20% are estimated to \nbe in fair condition, 48% in poor condition, and 32% in very poor condition. Practically none of \nthe roads are estimated to be in good or very good condition. \n \n4.  The state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road \nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development \nagencies. In January 2000, the Government terminated the Road Fund to meet the International \nMonetary Fund requirement to maintain one consolidated state budget. The taxes and receipts \nformerly contributing to the Road Fund are still collected, but now are paid directly to the \nnational treasury. Road maintenance and construction are now funded from the general state \nbudget. The following amounts (in million somoni) have been allocated to the road subsector in \nthe national budget for 2003: 5.3 for maintenance, 10.5 for new construction, and 10.6 for \nrehabilitation, for a total of 26.4. These are approximately equivalent to the following amounts \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 March 2004. \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2003. Country Report No. 03/10. Washington, DC. ", "2  \n(in million dollars): 1.8 for maintenance, 3.5 for new construction, 3.5 for rehabilitation, and 8.8 \ntotal.  The  allocations  for  the  road  subsector  comprise  approximately  3%  of  total  planned \nGovernment expenditures for 2003. The annual requirement for maintenance of the 4,700 km of \nnational roads is estimated at $16 million, which is almost twice the total road subsector budget. \n \n5.  Funding for road maintenance has decreased substantially since independence in 1991, \nand this inadequate funding is reflected in the deteriorated condition of the road network. \nMaintenance funding was also unavailable during the civil war, when numerous bridges and \nroad  sections  were  damaged.  Allocation  of  funding  is  often  restricted  to  emergency \nmaintenance  needs  and  is  insufficient  for  routine  or  periodic  maintenance  requirements.  \nLittle preventive maintenance is currently being undertaken outside of Dushanbe as part of a \nplanned road maintenance program. MOT is responsible for planning and coordinating the \nmaintenance of the road network in the country. MOT maintains roads and bridges through five \nregional maintenance divisions that are responsible for maintaining approximately 13,700 km of \nroad, and employed 3,291 people in 2001. The road maintenance divisions are state entities, \nattached to MOT. \n \n6.  The  Government\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Policy  Statement  of  1998  outlines  the  policy \ndirective requiring development of the transport sector to be based on market-oriented reforms \nand restructuring to improve efficiency. The Government\u2019s strategy for the road subsector is to \nrehabilitate and maintain the road infrastructure and to develop an efficient road transport \nindustry through an increased role for the private sector in providing transport services, greater \nreliance on cost recovery to finance road maintenance, and rehabilitation of the critical parts of \nthe road network and transport services that remain under state control. The Government aims \nto increase expenditures on road maintenance, and has been doing so in line with ADB's policy \ndialogue,  and  to  implement  changes  to  the  regulatory  framework  necessary  to  encourage \ngreater involvement by the private sector in road transport. The Government\u2019s strategy includes \nthe development of international road corridors to facilitate Tajikistan\u2019s external trade. \n \n7.  ADB has provided the largest amount of assistance to the transport sector of any of the \ninternational organizations, with four loans and six TAs fully or partly related to the sector.3  \nADB has been intensively involved in policy dialogue for the transport sector in general, and the \nroad subsector in particular, since it began its involvement with the transport sector in 1998.  \nThe  areas  covered  by  the  policy  dialogue  include  financing  of  road  maintenance, \ncommercialization of transport services, improvement of management efficiency in the transport \nsector by improving key institutions, separation of regulatory and operational functions of the \nsector, and other areas primarily related to the transition to a market economy. Market-oriented \nreforms  for  the  transport  sector  have  been  and  are  now  being  introduced  through \nimplementation  of  ongoing  project  loans,  the  completed  program  loan,  and  advisory  TA.  \nThe policy dialogue has achieved substantial progress in establishing the legal framework for \nthe transport-sector institutions, through passage of laws and regulations, but less progress has \nbeen made in commercialization of transport enterprises.4 As a result of policy dialogue with and \nTA from ADB, the administration of the transport sector was reorganized and MOT was created. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003.

", "  3\nMOT is now responsible for planning and coordinating all modes of transport within the country. \nIn the future, most state-owned enterprises will play a minor role and will be expected to operate \nas  independent  commercial  enterprises.  MOT\u2019s  Roads  Department  is  responsible  for \nadministration, maintenance, and construction of roads in Tajikistan, and has a number of \nassociated entities involved in these activities. Tariffs for road freight have been completely \nderegulated; road haulage organizations enter into agreements with customers at negotiated \nrates. Tariffs for passenger transport are still regulated, but in practice fares vary according to \ncompetition. Separate deputy ministers have regulatory and oversight responsibilities for rail \ntransport and air transport. \n \n8.  The  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  Border  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  I)  (footnote  3), \napproved in 2003, will improve about 140 km of the road from Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz border, \nwhich has a total length of 350 km. The first phase includes (i) a combination of rehabilitation of \nkm 22\u201395, minor rehabilitation of km 95\u2013150, and minor works on the km 9\u201322 section; and  \n(ii) improvement of 77 km of rural roads in the project area. The project's policy dialogue is \naddressing the issue of financing road maintenance through loan covenants requiring specified \nincreases  in  financing  of  maintenance  of  the  project  road  and  other  roads  under  MOT \njurisdiction. The proposed Project will continue ADB\u2019s improvement of the road from Dushanbe \nto the Kyrgyz border, focusing on the two-lane section from km 140 (between Nurobod and the \nTavildara Junction) to Nimich (km 217, the Tajikabad Junction), a distance of approximately  \n77 km.5 In addition, about 100 km of rural roads in the project area will also be rehabilitated.  \n \n9.  The project road is important both as a national and international transport corridor for \nTajikistan. As a key national road, the project road provides the primary link between Dushanbe \nand the Rasht Valley, to the northeast. For several months during the winter, the road also \nserves as a link between the northern Sugdh region of Tajikistan and the rest of the country. \nThe  road  is  also  important  from  a  regional  perspective,  as  it  forms  part  of  the  corridor \nconnecting Afghanistan and Tajikistan to the People's Republic of China and other countries in \nthe region. After crossing the Tajik-Kyrgyz border, the road connects to Sary Tash in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and to the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road corridor. Improvement of the Osh-Sary \nTash-Irkeshtam  road  was  studied  under  ADB's  TA  for  Regional  Cooperation  in  Transport \nProjects in Central Asia.6 ADB\u2019s program for the Kyrgyz Republic for 2004 includes a loan for \nthe rehabilitation of sections of this road as well as a loan for regional customs modernization, \nwhich will facilitate regional trade. In addition to rehabilitating this key transport corridor, the \nproposed Project will address the national problem of road maintenance through continued \npolicy dialogue.  \n \n10.  The initial poverty and social assessment and rapid environmental assessment for the \nProject are in Appendix 2. The project area is rural and mountainous, and agriculture is the \nprimary economic activity. Approximately 174,000 people live in the three districts through which \nthe proposed project road section passes. Most project beneficiaries live in rural areas where the \nincidence of poverty is particularly severe. The project area is adjacent to that for the Loan 2062-\nTAJ(SF), the first phase, and has similar social and economic conditions, although the project \narea for the proposed Project is further from Dushanbe and thus more remote. The project area \nwas the scene of heavy fighting during Tajikistan\u2019s civil war in the mid-1990s. The poverty \nincidence is expected to be about the same as the 91% incidence in the project area for the first \n                                                 \n5  The works on km 95\u2013150 under Loan 2062-TAJ(SF), phase I (footnote 3) will comprise minor rehabilitation, limited \nto safety improvements and mitigation of the impact of landslides. The civil works under the proposed Project \n(phase II) will begin at km 140. This does not comprise duplication of work on km 140\u2013150, as the works on these \n10 km under phase I are limited to maintenance necessary before the commencement of the works under phase II.  \n6  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Regional Cooperation in Transport Projects in Central Asia. Manila. ", "4  \nphase. The main causes of poverty are lack of employment opportunities and low prices received \nfor agricultural produce. The Project will address these causes by improving access to Dushanbe \nand other locations with more employment opportunities and larger markets for agricultural \nproduce. The Project will lead to reduced transport costs, most of which will be passed on to \ntransport users. The Project will also improve access to health and other social services and \nimprove road safety. The population in the project area is primarily Tajik. The environmental and \nsocial impacts are expected to be minimal, as the project will rehabilitate the existing alignment, \nexcept  for  minor  deviations  due  to  difficult  geotechnical  conditions  or  to  improve  safety \nconditions. No resettlement or resettlement effects are anticipated. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy7 in Tajikistan focuses on promoting economic growth through \n(i) rural development, including improving transport and other infrastructure; and (ii) regional \ncooperation, including rehabilitating transport links to neighboring countries. The Project will \ncontribute to the achievement of ADB\u2019s strategy by rehabilitating the road linking Tajikistan to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and the People's Republic of China, and by improving rural roads. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  prepare  the  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  Border  Road \nRehabilitation Project (Phase II), suitable for ADB financing, including furthering the progress of \ninstitutional development and policy reforms in the road subsector initiated by previous projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will prepare a feasibility study and preliminary design to rehabilitate the section of \nthe road from km 140 (between Nurobod and the Tavildara Junction) to Nimich (km 217, the \nTajikabad Junction), a total distance of approximately 77 km, and selected rural roads totaling \nabout 100 km. The feasibility study prepared under the TA will include (i) an update of the \ntransport sector profile for Tajikistan, including financial status, road safety, road maintenance, \nand traffic management; (ii) a review of the status of institutional development and policy reforms \nin  the  road  subsector  initiated  under  previous  projects;  (iii)  selection  criteria  and  prioritized \nrankings, based on poverty and other indicators, for rural roads and bridges to be included in the \nProject; (iv) cost estimates and the technical and economic feasibility study for the main road and \nrural roads comprising the Project, including an examination of the appropriate use of labor-\nintensive techniques for construction and maintenance; (v) an environmental impact assessment; \n(vi) social impact analysis including any involuntary resettlement effects attributable to the Project; \n(vii) poverty impact analysis; and (viii) analysis of the need for further advisory TA for institutional \nstrengthening of MOT. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix \n3. Implementation of the TA is contingent on the United Nations security classification for the \nproject area (and any areas through which travel is required) remaining at the current level 3 or \nlower.8 No deterioration of the security situation is anticipated. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent, consisting of $298,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $292,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government has \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008): Tajikistan.

", "  5\nrequested ADB to provide $500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$202,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Tajikistan will \nfinance the balance of the local currency cost equivalent of $90,000 by providing required office \naccommodation and services, local communications, remuneration and per diem for counterpart \nstaff, and other items, mostly in kind. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The draft cost estimates for the TA are \nshown in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MOT, which will appoint a project coordinator \nfrom its project implementation unit to be responsible for the TA's day-to-day implementation and \nto provide administrative and technical support to the consultants. MOT\u2019s existing project steering \ncommittee will monitor the TA's implementation.  \n \n16.  An international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants will be selected \nand engaged by ADB, using the quality- and cost-based selection method. The consultants will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The simplified \ntechnical proposal procedure will be used to select the consultants. A total of about 11 person-\nmonths of international and 50 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. \nThe consultants will have had extensive experience in (i) transport economics, including related \nfinancial  management;  (ii)  economic  evaluation  of  road  projects;  (iii)  highway  engineering, \nincluding mountainous topography, bridges, and drainage structures; (iv) road maintenance and \nroad safety; and (v) environmental, social, and poverty impact assessments. For MOT to obtain \nthe maximum benefit from the consulting services, the consultants will be based full-time in \nDushanbe, with a field office in Garm or Nurobod during fieldwork. To facilitate the work and \nensure that MOT gains technical expertise and knowledge, the consultant team will work closely \nwith  counterpart  technical  experts  from  MOT.  MOT  has  agreed  to  provide  the  counterpart \ntechnical staff, who will assist with the necessary surveys and fieldwork, in a timely manner. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  7  months  beginning  in  November  2004.  \nThe consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month of the commencement of their \nservices; (ii) an interim report within 3 months; (iii) a draft final report within 6 months, including \nthe environmental, social, and poverty impact assessment reports as separate documents; and \n(iv)  a  final  report  within  3  weeks  after  the  receipt  of  comments  from  MOT  and  ADB.  \nThe Government, ADB, and the consultants will meet in Dushanbe to review and endorse the \ninception report and the draft final report. The consultants will conduct seminars for MOT staff \nand any other interested Government organizations concerning the techniques, analysis, and \nfindings of the TA. Equipment to be provided under the TA will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tajikistan for preparing the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation \nProject (Phase II), and hereby reports this action to the Board.

The road subsector contributes to poverty \nreduction directly through improved access to and reduced costs for transport of agricultural products to markets, \nemployment opportunities, and social services; and indirectly through stimulating economic development. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Poverty Classification: Poverty Intervention \n   \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?    \n \nTajikistan is the poorest country among the Central Asian republics, with a poverty incidence of 83%. The poverty \nincidence in the project area is expected to be higher than the national incidence, with a preliminary estimate of \n91%. The project area is rural and mountainous, and agriculture is the primary economic activity. The project road \nprovides the area\u2019s only access to the capital and to other urban areas. The Project will reduce poverty by reducing \nthe cost of road transport and improving the access of the rural poor population to market opportunities, other \neconomic activities, and social services by improving the project road and rural roads. The Project will also \ngenerate employment in construction activities for local residents. \n \nA detailed poverty analysis will be carried out as part of the technical assistance (TA) to identify the causes of \npoverty in the project area and demonstrate how the Project will help reduce poverty by incorporating specific \nmeasures in the project scope. The analysis will be based on the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis and \nHandbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThrough public consultation and a detailed socioeconomic survey, stakeholder analysis will be carried out by the \nexecuting agency and the consultants during the preparation of the initial environmental examination (IEE) and the \nsocial and poverty impact analysis. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?

Identify  and  describe \ninternational traffic and transnational transit traffic. \n \n9.  Carry out topographic surveys; and prepare alignment plans, longitudinal sections, cross-\nsections, and drainage surveys. Assess the right-of-way requirements for the project roads. Study \nthe existing road structure. Review pavement condition and strength through visual inspection, \nroughness measurement, and deflection measurements, and by making test pits and conducting \nlaboratory tests on the pit samples. Based on the investigation results, determine the most cost-\neffective way of rehabilitating the pavement to accommodate the forecast traffic and meet Tajik \nand  international  standards,  and  undertake  necessary  preliminary  engineering  design.  \nConfirm the suitability of locally available construction materials, and identify quarries and borrow \npits.  If  warranted  by  social  surveys,  include  in  the  preliminary  design  possible  locations  for \n\u201croadside stations\u201d (for provision of roadside services, sale of local goods, etc.) \n \n10.  Examine rockfall and landslide hazards, study the properties of rocks and soils of mountain \nslopes, study slope stability of embankments and cuttings, and propose possible remedial actions. \nStudy the geology, soil and rock properties, and hydrology of the problem areas. Prepare a \npreliminary design for the chosen remedial structures. Study the feasibility of retaining walls, \ngalleries,  and  tunnels  to  address  difficult  topographical  and  geological  road  conditions,  if \napplicable. Examine the existing bridges, culverts and other drainage structures, and retaining \nstructures on the project roads to determine their condition, adequacy, load-bearing capacity, \nanticipated future serviceability, and the general extent of repairs and strengthening needed. \n \n11.
