The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy in Pakistan gives high priority to human \nresource development, including literacy and skills development among women. Low levels of \nliteracy among women, especially in the rural areas, have been of particular concern since \nliteracy is a first step in skills development and hence an improved capacity to undertake \nlivelihood activities. With this in view, consultations on improving literacy levels and basic skills \namong women were conducted with the Government, local elected officials, and representatives \nof civil society during the technical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission for the proposed ADB \nSustainable Livelihood in Barani Areas Project, Punjab (SLBAP) in May 2003. A concept paper \nwas prepared, aimed at improving literacy levels and basic skills among women in conjunction \nwith the livelihood opportunities to be provided under the proposed SLBAP. The concept was \nendorsed for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund at its Fourth Strategy Meeting \nin January 2004. To further discuss the scope and implementation arrangements of this TA, a \nreconnaissance mission was undertaken in June 2004 followed by a Fact-Finding Mission in \nAugust. During these missions, detailed discussions were also held with concerned government \ndepartments,  district  government  officials,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and \ndevelopment partners experienced in nonformal literacy and skills training education. The aim \nwas to formulate a viable TA1 intervention to support literacy and skills development that is to be \nimplemented along with the proposed SLBAP. The TA framework is included as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  At 45%, Pakistan has one of the lowest literacy rates in the South Asian region (58% for \nmales and 32% for females).2 There were an estimated 49 million illiterates in the country in \n1995, out of which 28.4 million were women. The need for increasing literacy and a realistic \nemphasis on providing education for all was laid out in the National Education Policy 1998\u2013\n2010. Basic education, comprising early childhood education, elementary education, and adult \nliteracy,  have  been  assigned  top  priority  in  this  policy.  The  policy  provided  for  nonformal \neducation by emphasizing that nonformal systems will be adopted to complement the formal \nsystem. In the Perspective Plan 2001\u201311, Education For All was assigned a central position in \nimplementing this policy. Education sector reform strategies have been developed and attempts \nare being made to address the literacy issue down to district level. Nonformal education for rural \nwomen is also an important pillar in the poverty reduction strategy of the Government and of the \nprovincial  government  of  Punjab.  The  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper \nrecognizes that the incidence of poverty affects women more adversely on account of their \nweak  position  and  draws  attention  to  the  country\u2019s  high  rates  of  female  illiteracy  and  the \n8 million girls out of school. The Government therefore assigns a high priority to empowerment \nof women through literacy.  \n \n3.  As  an  indication  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  toward  literacy,  an  independent \ndepartment for literacy has been created in 2001 at the provincial level in Punjab. Further, as a \nresult of the devolution of powers to district governments, Executive District Office for Literacy \nhave been posted at all districts of the province. In each district, the Literacy Department, under \nthe provisions of the Part C of the First Schedule of the Local Government Ordinance, 2001, is \nresponsible  for  literacy  campaigns,  basic  education,  continuing  education,  and  vocational \neducation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 26 April 2004. \n2  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Pakistan. Manila. \n ", " 2  \n4.  At  present,  a  large  number  of  NGOs  in  Punjab  are  working  in  the  field  of  social \ndevelopment; however, only a few of them are in the area of literacy and nonformal education \nand are also implementing functional literacy courses for women. Other programs in the area of \nskills training are the rural support programs. These programs focus on social mobilization, \ncapacity  building,  skills  learning,  microcredit,  vocational  training,  and  establishing  linkages \nbetween communities and governmental departments. The Government\u2019s and NGOs\u2019 programs \nin the field of literacy and basic education have provided benefits to about 0.2 million people on \naverage per year. However, these efforts do not seem to be making sufficient progress in \neliminating illiteracy in the country. There are many reasons for their failure, including the lack of \nfinancial  resources,  unrealistic  targets,  the  conservative  attitude  of  the  community,  and \noverpopulation, as well as a lack of focused material suited to local needs. There has been no \nspecial curriculum available for nonformal basic education for adults and children, and so the \ncurriculum of the formal schools was used for these programs. Adults were taught a syllabus \nthat did not have any functional or occupational usefulness. The curriculum has more emphasis \non knowledge and less on skills. This situation is now changing for basic literacy with the \nongoing development of a syllabus with the assistance of United Nations Educational, Scientific \nand Cultural Organization. However, the need for a syllabus for functional literacy aligned to \nskills training remains. \n \n5.  Barani areas in Punjab are areas that do not have access to canal irrigation and are \ncharacterized by low economic productivity and a high incidence of poverty. Out of the 10 \ndistricts in the proposed SLBAP, four are in the lowest poverty quintile with an estimated 47% of \nthe population living below the poverty line. Sources of livelihood are limited and people are \nvery dependent on agriculture for their food and income. The goal of the proposed SLBAP is to \nimprove the social and economic well-being of the population in the barani areas. Specifically, \nthe project is aimed at improving the livelihood system of the poor households in the project \nareas with an emphasis on vulnerable segments of the rural population, including women. The \nproject approach will include linkages and partnerships among the main stakeholders, such as \npoor people, through the organization of groups of poor women and local governments to \ndevelop  good  governance  at  the  grassroots  level.  One  of  the  primary  constraints  to \ndevelopment in the project area is the very low literacy rate, especially among women, which in \nrural  Punjab  is  only  21%,  far  less  than  the  rate  nationwide.  With  low,  indeed  practically \nnonexistent literacy and numeracy skills, it is very difficult for women to learn new livelihood \nskills. On the other hand, in a very traditional society where the main daily preoccupation is \nfinding the basic necessities, it is difficult to promote literacy programs without some kind of \nincentive  over  and  above  literacy  itself.  Experience  in  Pakistan  indicates  that  combining \nprograms in skills training and literacy is one means of both overcoming illiteracy and promoting \nlivelihood improvements. This is especially the case if skills training can be itself linked to rural \nfinance programs so that the skills can be turned into investments. Accordingly, a dedicated \ncomponent (Literacy through Skills Training) has been included in the design of the proposed \nSLBAP aimed at direct poverty reduction by targeting a particularly deprived section of the \npopulation,  namely  poor  women  and  girls.  The  activities,  supported  through  extensive \ncommunity mobilization, will be aimed at small groups of between 10 and 15 women. Support \nfor group formation and supervision will be financed by SLBAP.  \n \n6.  The following themes or thrusts on women\u2019s literacy were identified by ADB missions \nduring consultations with the Government, development partners, government agencies, and \nNGOs involved in nonformal education programs: (i) skills training should be an integral part of \nthe functional and literacy programs, as it is apparent that women are uninterested in literacy \nalone, and need some economic incentive to participate in literacy programs; (ii) the TA should \nbe focused in a few selected unions of the barani districts to test more appropriate delivery \n ", "  3\nprocesses and produce more impact on the local communities; (iii) the TA should be carried out \nthrough NGOs to help build their capacity as well as to ensure the ownership of the program by \nthe community; (iv) establishing a women\u2019s literacy resource center under the TA would be an \ninnovative aspect of the Project and would provide future support for district governments for the \nimplementation  of  nonformal  education  programs;  (v) the  target  area  of  the  TA  should  be \ndifferent from the target areas of the programs implemented by other development partners and \nthe Government.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The  objectives  of  the  TA  are  to  undertake  the  preparatory  work  for  a  program  to \nempower rural girls and women through the nonformal provision of functional literacy, skills \ntraining, and basic education to be financed as part of SLBAP. Participation in the training under \nthe proposed SLBAP will then increase access of rural poor women both to development \nactivities financed by the ensuing investments made under the proposed SLBAP and to other \nopportunities for self-advancement. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will consist of the following components: (i) the preparation of a syllabus and of \ntraining materials suited for literacy training and skills training aimed specifically at girls and \nwomen in isolated, underdeveloped, and disadvantaged rural areas;3 (ii) the pilot testing and \nassessment  of  service  delivery  to  poor  girls  and  women  in  selected  pilot  villages;  (iii)  an \nexpansion of the training program to meet the demand expected from the implementation of \nSLBAP; and (iv) the establishment of women\u2019s literacy resource centers in each district covered \nby the proposed SLBAP to aid in sustainability and expansion of the program. \n \n9.   The TA will be implemented with the assistance of a national-level NGO experienced in \nwomen\u2019s education and skills training within rural areas of the country. The first step in the \nprocess of material development will be for the national NGO and the Department of Literacy \nand Non-Formal Education (DLNE) to agree on the skills to be imparted along with literacy and \nprimary education training. The NGO, with guidance from an international and a domestic \nconsultant, will then design simple syllabi for the skills to be imparted and work with an audio-\nvisual production team to produce simple, inexpensive, and easily replicated training materials. \n(Illustrated comic books have proven very successful both for literacy training and for skills \ntraining in South East Asia and other regions). Literacy and skills trainers from the NGO will \nthen be trained in the use of the materials. These materials will be tested in pilot villages located \nwithin each of the 10 barani districts of Punjab, which will form the project area for the proposed \nSLBAP. The target group for participation in the pilot areas will be females aged 15\u201340. The \nNGO will be responsible for identifying particularly vulnerable and poverty-affected groups and \nfor organizing women\u2019s community organizations among them. These groups will be provided \nwith training and support and will be linked to partners associated with the literacy program and \nrural financial agencies for possible enterprise financing. \n \n                                                 \n3  Basic skills will include such activities as household health and sanitation, child care, dietary improvement and food \npreservation, basic household finances, as well as small-scale domestic enterprises such as livestock raising, \nkitchen gardening, small-scale handicrafts and tailoring, and business development. \n ", " 4  \n10.  Upon completion of 6\u20138 months of pilot training, the curricula and training materials will \nbe reviewed by the consultant team together with the NGO staff involved in the pilot areas and \nstaff of DLNE. Improvements will be made based on feedback from both the trainers and the \ntrainees  and  will  be  incorporated  into  the  program.  Training  materials  will  then  be  mass-\nproduced and made available at both the district and union levels and to all NGOs active in \ntraining in the province. Further training of trainers will then be undertaken, based on the \nupgraded  and  revised  training  materials.  Pilot  classes  will  continue  throughout  the  TA \nimplementation period. \n \n11.   The TA will provide for the establishment of women\u2019s literacy resource centers in each \ndistrict within the Department of Literacy offices that will be responsible for the development of \ninformation, knowledge, and imparting training to the teachers, vocational trainers, and NGO \nfield staff. These centers will be provided with printed material relating to literacy training as well \nas an Internet connection so that the TA-developed syllabus as well as other literacy aides can \nbe readily accessed. These centers will also provide information on SLBAP, which may be \nrelevant to individuals and agencies promoting skills-based literacy training. They will also \nsupport female beneficiaries by enhancing their exposure and access to financial products \noffered by  microfinance institutions. In addition, marketing of high value agriculture produce and \ncrafts will also be supported through these centers. The provincial government of Punjab has \nassured that the women\u2019s literacy resource centers will be operated and maintained as part of \nthe  district  literacy  infrastructure.  The  TA  will  also  help  DLNE  in  effective  monitoring  and \nevaluation of activities by carrying out baseline and follow-up surveys and assessments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 consisting of $60,000 in foreign cost \nand $440,000 in local cost. A detailed cost estimate and financing plan is shown in Appendix 2. \nADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $60,000 and a portion of the local currency \ncost amounting to $340,000 for a total of $400,000. The funds will be sourced from the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund and will be used for financing international and local consultants, \nNGO contracts for course material preparation, field staff training, and the field-testing and mass \nproduction of training materials. The balance of the local cost (amounting to $100,000) will be \nfinanced  by  the  provincial  government  of  Punjab,  primarily  in  kind  and  will  consist  of  the \nprovision  of  office  space,  venues  for  workshops  and  training,  space  for  teacher  resource \ncenters, salaries of counterpart staff of DLNE and school teachers, and logistical support for \ncarrying out the baseline and follow-up surveys. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  DLNE  and  will  have  an  advisory  and \nsupervisory role. DLNE will monitor the activities of the proposed project through the Executive \nDistrict  Office  for  Literacy  and  their  field  supervisory  staff.  The  Agency  for  Barani  Areas \nDevelopment4  will  assist  in  identifying  locations  for  field  interventions  and  monitoring  field \nactivities during the implementation of the TA. An international and a domestic community \neducation specialist will be recruited as individual consultants to assist DLNE to coordinate \nimplementation of the TA and to provide technical guidance on an intermittent basis. The terms \nof reference for the consultants are shown in Appendix 3. A steering committee under the TA \nwill be established and chaired by DLNE. Representatives from the Education Department, \n                                                 \n4  The Agency for Barani Areas Development will be the Executing Agency for the proposed SLBAP. \n ", "  5\ndistricts concerned, and NGOs will be members of the committee, which will meet on a quarterly \nbasis. \n \n14.  The consulting services for the TA total 13 person-months. An NGO with experience in \nrural nonformal education will be recruited in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants to undertake curriculum and training material development. The NGO will provide \na team of experts experienced in literacy material development as well as technical specialists \nin  health  and  sanitation,  nutrition  and  food  microfinance  processing,  horticulture,  livestock \nextension, microenterprises, and home economics. In addition, the NGO will manage the day-\nto-day field-testing of service delivery to poor girls and women. The selection of the NGO will be \nbased  on  (i) demonstrated  experience  in  the  implementation  of  nonformal  basic  education \nprograms including functional literacy, livelihood skills, and primary education in rural areas of \nPunjab; (ii) demonstrated experience in and capacity to provide and conduct teacher training as \nwell as capacity to arrange skills training in the area; (iii) experience in the development and \nprovision of suitable and needs-based learning materials for the target group; and (iv) ability to \ndevelop  a  sound  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  for  the  TA  and  project  and  effective \nmonitoring tools for the local NGO(s) in the field. Detailed activities to be undertaken by the \nNGO are shown in Appendix 3. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over a 2-year period in accordance with the implementation \nschedule  shown  in  Appendix 4.  The  TA  is  expected  to  start  in  January  2005  and  to  be \ncompleted by 31 December 2006. The first 3 months will be devoted to the selection of the \nnational-level NGO by the consultants, in consultation with ADB. The next 3 months will be \ndevoted to training material development. Training of NGO staff in the use of the materials will \nthen be undertaken over the fourth and fifth month of the project. The next 10 months will entail \nfield-testing by the NGO. This period will be followed by a 2-month feedback and assessment \nperiod through a series of district-level seminars, after which revisions will be made to the \nteaching materials and a contract let for mass production. The balance of the TA period will be \nspent on training additional NGO/community teachers in the use of the revised training materials \nand expansion of the field program in anticipation of further funding from SLBAP. \n \n16.  The consultants and the NGO will submit an inception report to ADB within the first 2 \nmonths of implementation, followed by a midterm review after the first 12 months and a full \nreview after the completion of initial field-testing. Structured impact assessments will be carried \nout during the implementation of the TA. A final report detailing the results and achievements of \nthe TA will be submitted to ADB 1 month prior to the end of the project implementation period.  \n \n \nIV.
