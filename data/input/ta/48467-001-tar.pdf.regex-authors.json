INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Concessions for Ulaanbaatar\u2019s Municipal Services. \nFollowing a reconnaissance mission to Ulaanbaatar City in September 2014, and a follow-up \nmission in February 2015, ADB and the government reached a preliminary understanding on \nthe objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference (TOR) for \nconsultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A decade of strong economic growth driven by the mining sector has substantially \nboosted average incomes in Mongolia and helped ensure that the Millennium Development \nGoals for education and health are on track to being achieved. However, Mongolia is trailing \nwith regard to the poverty, malnutrition, and environment goals. More than a quarter of the \npopulation were living below the national poverty line in 2012, and inequality has increased. \nUnderinvestment in public services and quality shortcomings constrain Mongolia\u2019s economic \nand development prospects\u2014the 2014\u20132015 Global Competitiveness Report ranked Mongolia \n112nd out of 144 countries on infrastructure quality, and the World Bank\u2019s 2014 Logistics \nPerformance Index ranked Mongolia\u2019s infrastructure 120th out of 160 countries.2 \n \n3.  Inequality is stark in the capital Ulaanbaatar, where almost half of the residents lack \naccess  to  clean  water  and  sanitation,  and  the  use  of  highly  polluting  coal-fired  stoves  is \nwidespread because of an absence of district heating. About 60% of Ulaanbaatar\u2019s urban \nresidents, or 800,000 people, live in informal ger areas\u2014expanding, unplanned settlements of \nlow-  and  medium-income  households  with  un-serviced  plots,  unpaved  roads,  and  scant \nfacilities. A lack of employment opportunities and basic urban services elsewhere in Mongolia, \ncombined with high population growth, underpins migration to Ulaanbaatar and expansion of the \nger areas, which adds to pressures on the already inadequate services there. Much of the other \nbuilt-up areas of Ulaanbaatar also lack adequate access to essential public services. \n \n4.  Ulaanbaatar City government initiated a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) program in \n2013.  The  city\u2019s  economic  development  strategy  commits  to  developing  a  policy  that  will \nenhance and encourage the development of PPPs, and lists key actions to be taken in support \nof PPPs.3 Reflecting these commitments, in 2013, the city adopted a list of planned concessions \ncovering a range of small and medium-sized projects in transport, energy, wastewater and \nsanitation,  education,  health,  elderly  care,  and  social  housing.4  In  2013\u20132014,  six  small \nconcessions were signed by Ulaanbaatar City in health and elderly care, transport, wastewater \ntreatment, and for a government building; one reached financial closure. \n \n5.  PPPs offer a number of advantages. The strong performance incentives provided by \nPPPs, the life-cycle approach to asset management inclusive of full-funded maintenance, and \nthe expertise brought by the private sector can help overcome problems with construction \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 February 2015. The TA is not \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Mongolia.  Clearance  to  proceed  was  received  on \n25 February 2015. \n2  World Economic Forum. 2014.

Ulaanbaatar Economic Development Strategy. Ulaanbaatar. \n4  In Mongolia, the term \u201cconcessions\u201d encompasses PPPs, build\u2013transfer projects, and a range of other structures. \nPPPs are a subset of concessions that deliver public services under performance-based agreements that share \nrisks between partners. \n ", "2  \nquality and operational efficiency in the city\u2019s public services. By drawing in additional financial \nresources, PPPs can help Ulaanbaatar City speed up the expansion of service coverage. \n \n6.  While Ulaanbaatar City's budget is prepared in cooperation with the central government, \nit is approved by the city assembly and the city has the authority to borrow.5 Ulaanbaatar City \nalso has the authority to approve a list of proposed concessions and to enter into concessions \nunder the Law on Concessions. The city benefits from Mongolia\u2019s relatively well-developed legal \nand regulatory framework for PPPs and the operation since 2011 of a PPP unit within the \ncentral government. But Ulaanbaatar City\u2019s operational framework for PPPs is still in the early \nstages of development.6 In Ulaanbaatar, as elsewhere in the country, PPPs are still a new \napproach for senior decision makers, and capacity is in its formative stages. It is particularly \nimportant that Ulaanbaatar City complete high-quality PPPs to (i) improve public services, and \n(ii) provide a tool for building capacity for PPPs and refining approaches to project preparation \nand financing. \n \n7.  Under  its  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2012\u20132016,  ADB  encourages \nprivate participation in the financing and management of infrastructure and social services, \nincluding through support for model transactions. Underlying the strategy is an emphasis on \ncapacity development, policy reform, and strengthening of the enabling environment for PPPs. \nThe expected result is fewer bottlenecks to growth, increased access to basic services, and \nwider  participation  in  the  growth  process.  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy  for \nMongolia, 2014\u20132016 retains these directions, while emphasizing the needs of Ulaanbaatar.7 \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s support has focused on the central government.8 This experience provides a \nbasis for extending ADB\u2019s assistance to PPPs to local governments. Ulaanbaatar City is a good \ncandidate  for  ADB  support  as  it  has  wide  responsibilities  for  the  delivery  of  basic  public \nservices, has an independent budget, and generates most of its own revenue. It has about \n3,000 employees and 25 separate entities, and is large enough to sustain adequate capacity in \nPPPs. ADB is already actively involved in ger area development, and can help establish PPPs \nas an additional tool for addressing the needs of Ulaanbaatar\u2019s poorer households.9 \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be the enhanced development of PPPs in Ulaanbaatar City. The TA is \naligned with the commitment of the Ulaanbaatar Economic Development Strategy to enhance \nand encourage the development of PPPs. The outcome will be a road map for the fiscally \naffordable delivery of municipal services in Ulaanbaatar City by PPPs. Performance will be \n                                                \n5  Mongolia's legal framework assigns Ulaanbaatar City responsibility for baslc municipal services, and allows the \ncentral government to delegate responsibility for delivering additional, specific social services. \n6  ADB presents a PPP operational framework as comprising four pillars: advocacy and capacity development \n(pillar 1), the enabling environment (pillar 2), project development (pillar 3), and project financing (pillar 4).

Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will extend ADB\u2019s engagement in PPPs in Mongolia to local government level, \nwith a focus on Ulaanbaatar where the needs and opportunities are largest. It will help build the \ncapacity  of  Ulaanbaatar  City  for  PPPs  through  a  \u201clearning-by-doing\u201d  approach,  which  will \naddress capacity and institutional development while emphasizing project preparation. \n \n11.  Output 1 will be a PPP institutional assessment for Ulaanbaatar City. This will be a \nbuilding block for other outputs. An assessment of the enabling environment will be conducted \nfollowing  the  Infrascope  tool.10  The  market  and  technical  readiness  of  the  projects  in \nUlaanbaatar  City\u2019s  concession  list  and  other  potential  projects  will  be  assessed,  and  the \nperformance of recently completed concessions will be examined. The legal framework for \nPPPs will also be reviewed. Both supply- and demand-side considerations will be addressed. \n \n12.  Building on these assessments, initiatives will be identified that can be undertaken by \nUlaanbaatar  City  to  strengthen  project  planning  and  identification,  preparation,  and \nmanagement.11 The output will address the fiscal checks and balances required in Ulaanbaatar \nCity and by the central government to ensure a sound PPP program, such as the need to \nsubject projects to a fiscal risk assessment. The output will examine the potential need for a \nproject  development  facility,  drawing  on  ADB\u2019s  support  for  project  development  facilities \nelsewhere in Asia. Long-term staff capacity development needs will also be examined, and \nclose  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  role  and  responsibilities  of  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  Growth  and \nDevelopment  Committee  and  a  new  corporation  that  the  city  proposes  as  a  facilitator  of \neconomic development initiatives with the private sector. \n \n13.  The output will address institutional arrangements needed to correct for demand-side \nconstraints. The assessment will explore whether the private sector will have sufficient interest \nand resources to engage in PPPs in Ulaanbaatar City\u2019s municipal services, including whether \npotential concessionaires and financiers will require help to understand and be ready to engage \nin PPPs (e.g., via outreach programs). This will include considering the potential need for \ngovernment financial support to PPPs, e.g., viability gap payments or guarantee schemes.  \n \n14.  Drawing  on  consultation  with  relevant  central  and  Ulaanbaatar  City  government \nagencies,  regulators,  academics,  potential  concessionaires,  financial  institutions,  and  other \nstakeholders, an options paper will be prepared detailing the most feasible institutional reform \ninitiatives. A workshop supported by the TA will review the options paper. The options paper will \nidentify key issues and lessons requiring close attention, and help Ulaanbaatar City appraise the \ninitiatives and guide the finalization of an institutional assessment by the TA consultants. \n                                                \n10 This tool allows a government to assess the strengths and weaknesses of its enabling environment for PPPs by \nranking performance against indicators (Economist Intelligence Unit. 2015. Evaluating the Environment for Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership in Asia\u2013Pacific: The 2014 Infrascope. Manila: Economist Intelligence Unit and ADB (March). \n11 Matters expected to be addressed include the allocation of roles and decision-making responsibilities; coordination \narrangements between different levels of government and agencies; planning schedules, time lines, and process \nflowcharts; links of PPPs with public investment planning; the integration of PPPs into Ulaanbaatar City\u2019s budget; \nthe process for preparing the concession list and prioritizing projects; risk allocation and management; the \nassessment of fiscal risk and affordability; procurement practices; the management of social and environmental \nsafeguards; and transparency arrangements. \n ", "4  \n15.  Output 2 will be screened PPP projects. At least 10 PPPs will be screened, and TOR for \ntransaction advisory services will be prepared for PPPs that are to proceed and will require the \nengagement of external advisors. Projects to be screened will provide priority and essential \nservices for Ulaanbaatar, and be at an advanced stage of preparation (e.g., feasibility studies \nare complete). Priority will be given to projects in areas of Ulaanbaatar with a high presence of \npoor  households,  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  At  least  five  small,  low-risk  pro-poor \nprojects focusing on serving ger and remote areas of Ulaanbaatar City will be screened.12  \n \n16.  The screening will be undertaken by Ulaanbaatar City staff with the support of the TA, \nand thereby provide a valuable learning-by-doing exercise.13 Candidate PPPs for screening \ninclude water and wastewater plants, building energy efficiency, education and health facilities, \nelderly care facilities, community bath houses, social housing, waste management and recycling \nfacilities, car parks, industrial parks, and logistics terminals. The project screening will follow \nMongolia\u2019s PPP handbook, which was prepared with ADB support. The handbook recommends \nthat PPPs be screened before feasibility studies are conducted and transaction advisers are \nappointed. The screening process will assess whether a project is likely to deliver value for \nmoney  by  considering  the  scale  of  a  project,  the  specificity  of  the  outputs,  risk  transfer \nopportunities,  the  likelihood  of  financial  viability  and  market  interest  in  the  project,  and \naffordability for the government. Screening will identify any potential fiscal obligations and their \naffordability. The affordability to users will also be assessed. \n \n17.  Output 3 will be completed agreements for pro-poor PPPs. At least five small, low-risk \nPPPs that can provide quick benefits to poorer areas of Ulaanbaatar will be completed to \nprovide a practical application of the insights gained under other outputs of the TA. The PPPs \nwill be prepared by Ulaanbaatar City staff, with background technical support provided by the \nTA consultants. The PPP agreements will be finalized under the TA so that construction may \ncommence during the term of the TA. The most likely projects are community bath houses, \nkindergartens, small health facilities, or wastewater treatment plants in ger or remote areas. \nSuccessful completion of these simple projects will be an important test of the effectiveness of \nthe TA, and will provide a visible demonstration of the effectiveness of PPPs. \n \n18.  Output 4 will be enhanced analytical capacity of Ulaanbaatar City officials. Drawing on \nthe results of the other three outputs, a PPP road map will be prepared to provide a prioritized, \nfiscally  affordable  PPP  pipeline.  This  will  outline  the  actions  needed  to  strengthen  the \noperational framework for PPPs in Ulaanbaatar, including the legal framework. Key milestones \nand implementation schedules will be identified. Overall responsibility for drafting the road map \nwill rest with the staff of Ulaanbaatar City, with consultants undertaking specific tasks in a \nsupporting role. One issues paper will address the fiscal sustainability of the PPP program, and \nat least two other issues papers will be prepared. A summary of the issues papers will be \npublicly released. \n \n19.  The  road  map  will  address  both  demand-  and  supply-side  considerations,  setting \ndirections for the preparation of PPP policies, laws, and regulations; scaling up to a PPP \nprogram and pipeline; the potential role of a project development facility to improve project \nquality;  a  PPP  project  cycle  and  procedures  tailored  to  Ulaanbaatar  City;  PPPs  manuals, \n                                                \n12 Project selection under the TA will be coordinated with and complement the ger area development project \nsupported by ADB. It will also draw on reports and data that indicate where the poor of Ulaanbaatar City live (such \nas the results of National Statistical Office. 2012. Household Socio-Economic Survey 2011. Ulaanbaatar). \n13 A complementary, modest classroom-based training program in PPP concepts and skills will be provided to \nUlaanbaatar City\u2019s core PPP staff by the ongoing ADB TA for Developing a Conducive Environment for Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnerships. \n ", "  5\nguidelines, checklists, forms, and standardized contract definitions and terms; the formation and \ncomposition of a PPP unit; staff development; the role and usage of specialist advisers; fiscal \nchecks and balances; and the implementation of demonstration projects and learning by doing. \nWhile the focus will be on actions to be undertaken by Ulaanbaatar City, essential actions \nrequired by the central government will also be identified. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart staff, other services to \nconsultants,  and  other  in-kind  contributions;  and  will  assist  in  arranging  meetings  with \ncounterpart agencies. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 27 months from 31 July 2015 to 30 September 2017. \nThe executing agency will be Ulaanbaatar City Municipality Government and the implementing \nagency will be the Economic Development Department. The TA will be implemented in close \ncooperation with the central government\u2019s PPP unit, and in close coordination with related ADB-\nsupported projects, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and other development partners \nsupporting  PPPs  and  public  investment  in  Mongolia  (including  Canadian  Aid,  German \ndevelopment cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, \nthe International Finance Corporation, and the World Bank). An existing development partner \ncoordination group on PPPs will facilitate sharing information on the TA. Targeted workshops \nand  seminars  and  other  outreach  activities  will  raise  awareness  among  stakeholders, \ndisseminate findings, and seek feedback on the TA. \n \n22.  International consultants (including a team leader and PPP and institutional advisors) will \nprovide a total of up to 16 person-months input. National consultants (including a deputy team \nleader, legal specialist, project management specialist, and technical specialists) will provide a \ntotal of up to 51 person-months input. The outline TOR for consultants are in Appendix 3. As a \nsingle firm is likely to find it difficult to provide the diversity of skills and experience required, \nsome of which will only be known once project screening is completed, and timeliness in \nrecruitment is important, consultants will be recruited individually. PPP advisors and technical \nspecialists will be engaged on an output, lump-sum basis.14 \n \n23.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs, following the agreed time line and budget allocation. To support \nmonitoring and evaluation, consultants will submit an inception report, midterm report, draft final \nreport, and final report to the government and ADB. TA review missions will provide the main \nmeans of monitoring progress, assessing performance, and ensuring relevance. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for  Concessions  for  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \nMunicipal Services, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 ADB will engage consultants, as well as resource persons, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).
