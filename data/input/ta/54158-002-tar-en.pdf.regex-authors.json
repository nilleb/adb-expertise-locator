THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Government of the Philippines (GOP) has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  to  provide  support  for  developing  a  longer-term  funding  mechanism  to  combat  the \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus. In this regard, \nGOP and ADB have initiated discussions on various approaches to respond especially to the \nsocial impact of the pandemic, including establishing a fund for COVID-19 response projects. The \nproject would aim to impact through an accelerated response all aspects of the value chain for \ncombating COVID-19. The outcome would be a platform with clear principles for leveraging public \nfunds to catalyze funds from private and philanthropic sources for a deeper and wider impact on \nvulnerable  households  in  the  Philippines.  Outputs  would  include  establishing  institutional \nstructure and mechanism for a COVID-19 fund, principles for innovative finance usage, and \nhouseholds targeting methodology, and  providing financing for eligible subprojects.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The proposed Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision (RESP) technical assistance (TA) will \nsupport the GOP in developing a mechanism and principles for establishing a fund to combat the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. A series of activities to be implemented under the proposed TA will provide \ninputs for the structure of the fund. The GOP is addressing the urgent and still-unfolding crisis \nresulting from the spread of COVID-19 in the National Capital Region (NCR) and broader Luzon \narea, where a large majority of the country\u2019s 636 COVID-19 cases (as of 25 March 2020) reside. \nThe  social  and  economic  impact  of  COVID-19  containment  through  enhanced  community \nquarantine is felt most acutely in these areas of the country. \n \n3.  The TA will implement activities aimed at accelerating the immediate amelioration of the \ndirect and indirect effects of COVID-19 through socio-economic relief to the poorest and most \nvulnerable segments of the population in the NCR, by facilitating equitable access to food and \nessential supplies likely to prevent the spread of COVID-19 across the NCR and the Philippines. \nThese activities will directly contribute towards the design of a longer-term fund to respond to the \nsocial and economic impacts of COVID-19 epidemic. The TA will implement a scalable public-\nprivate-philanthropic-collaboration to provide food and essential supplies to the poorest and most \nvulnerable households to improve the health, living conditions, and resilience of the most COVID-\n19-impacted-households (CIHH) in the NCR and broader Luzon area. The TA proposal was \ndiscussed between ADB and GOP as part of ADB\u2019s overall response to contain impact of COVID-\n19 on 20 March 2020. The Department of Finance (DOF) has confirmed the proposal and \nimplementation arrangements. The TA is being identified as the \u201cFood by Friday\u201d program in GOP \nand ADB external disseminations. \n \n4.  TA Role. In its support to the GOP in designing and implementing a response for the \nCOVID-19 pandemic in the NCR, the TA will cover both emergency response phase activities and \nformulation of further prevention phase activities, including provision of immediate and short-term \ncritical components (such as food and essential supplies), partnerships with private entities for \nenhanced  emergency  responses,  and  supporting  national  capacities  for  emergency \npreparedness and mitigation, in line with ADB\u2019s disaster and emergency assistance policy.1 \n \n \n1 ADB. 2015. Disaster and Emergency Assistance. Operations Manual. OM D7. Manila.  \n ", "2 \n5.  Emergency Response Rationale. The epidemic has erupted at a staggering pace and \nscale, with 636 confirmed cases and 38 deaths (as of 25 March 2020) in the country, with over \n32 of these deaths between 12 and 25 March 2020.2 The scale of the disaster is deepening with \nthe number of medical personnel either placed under quarantine with suspected exposure to \nCOVID-19  or  passing  away  rapidly  escalating.  An  \u201cenhanced  community  quarantine\u201d  and \nmandated temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses have been put in effect on \nthe entire Luzon island, which includes the NCR.  \n \n6.  Quarantine restrictions have already begun to impact especially those households already \nat poverty level thresholds as well as informal, self-employed, seasonal, and contractual workers, \nwith a three-fold and interconnected impact: (i) catastrophic loss in income (inability to access \ndaily wage activities), (ii) closures of retail outlets reducing the ability to purchase essential \nsupplies (even if there were some savings), and (iii) limited supply of goods for the most \nvulnerable and weakest segments of the population with panic buying by the more economically \nprosperous. Further, for older age groups or people with pre-existing health issues, who are at \nmajor risk from COVID-19, there is a heightened need for isolation restricting the use of cash or \nvoucher schemes. There is thus a need to provide, in the immediate term, at least basic food and \nhygiene items to ensure the health of such households, allow for self-isolation to prevent further \nspread of COVID-19, and reduce socio-economic tensions or possibly even riots.   \n \n7.  Targeting Rationale. Over 75% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 are in the NCR. With \nover 12 million population, the NCR is the largest contributor to the country\u2019s GDP (36%). With a \ndense population spread (over 20,000 persons per square kilometer), it is also at the greatest \nthreat \u2013 already in evidence - from an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases, threatening also \nthe health, financial, and economic well-being of the nation. The most vulnerable households and \ninformal workers in the NCR is estimated to be around 756,000 households, or 3.8 million people, \nbased on existing social programs.3 The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) \nhas identified around 100,000 households as highly vulnerable and commenced provision of food \nand essential items to some of these households under its Pesos 1.3 billion quick response fund. \nThe GOP has also begun measures (including the creating of an Inter-Agency Task Force) to \nprovide essential items, faster procurement of medical and emergency supplies, and acceleration \nof release of donated relief goods. A private sector initiative, Project Ugnayan, is also aiming to \ndistribute  Pesos  1,000  food  vouchers  to  poorer  communities  in  the  NCR.  In  coordination \ndiscussions with these initiatives, ADB estimates that at least 55,000 CIHH are likely to be in \nurgent need of bridging support over an immediate term of between 2-8 weeks until other \nmeasures kick in. Providing essential food items to these 55,000 CIHH alone for a 3-month period \nwould require almost $25 million. Geographical selection of barangays/cities to identify CIHH \nhouseholds will be done during the preliminary phase of the proposed TA, as part of output 1. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision (RESP) mechanism established. \nThe TA will rapidly mobilize staff across ADB, under the \u201cOne ADB\u201d spirit, and experts who will \nwork with executing agency staff to design the mechanics for the RESP, including (i) CIHH \ntargeting approaches for CIHH in the NCR, (ii) composition and costing for essential food supplies \npackages per CIHH per month for an initial 2-8 week period, (iii) procurement and contracting \nprocesses for acquiring such supplies, (iv) linkages with local governments and barangays for \n \n2 Department of Health, GOP and World Health Organization online statistics, 22 March 2020. \n3 Including NCR population under the 4Ps program, indigent elderly people under the Listahan program, \nand 334,000 household-equivalents (covering 50% of the estimated informal workers in NCR). \n ", "3 \neffective  CIHH  identification  and  disbursement  support,  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystems.   \n \n9.  Output  2:  Public-Philanthropic-Partnerships\u2019  Platform  established.  The  TA  will \nestablish partnerships to leverage funds and core strengths of philanthropic-private entities in the \nPhilippines and across the world to help the poor and vulnerable in the NCR.  Specifically, the TA \nwill support the GOP in (i) expanding the pool of philanthropic-private sector entities willing to \nsupport the RESP (e.g. large manufacturing business, logistics entities, philanthropic funds, and \nbusiness associations),  (ii)  establishing contributions as either funds,4 in-kind goods (for the \nessential  food  supplies  packages)  or  services  (logistics,  distribution,  etc.),  (iii)  developing \nmechanisms with good governance practices for the deployment of, monitoring and reporting on, \nsuch  contributions,  and  (iv)  development  and  finalization  of  collaboration  agreements  with \nfinalized participants. Appropriate integrity due diligence principles and practices will be followed \nas required before accepting contributions (cash or in-kind) from third parties. \n \n10.  Output 3: Essential Food Supplies Provided to CIHH. TA funds will be utilized to (i) \nprocure and deliver essential food supplies packages5 for the pilot targeted CIHH in the NCR over \na 2-8 week period (targeting of CIHH will be led by DSWD supported by ADB experts to ensure \nno overlaps and coordination with other measures), (ii) procure additional distribution services to \nidentified CIHH, and (iii) procure consulting and technology services to provide coordination and \nmanagement information systems. The scale of activities will depend on both costing aspects as \nwell as collaborations with philanthropic-private sector entities. \n  \n11.  Output 4: Proposal for a Fund for COVID-19. The TA will engage consulting services to \ndevelop a possible ensuing project, conceptually entitled, Fund for COVID-19. This fund will aim \nto provide a longer-term proposal for the GOP to consider for meeting any widening spread of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and build on the learnings from the implementation activities in outputs 1 to \n3 above, while also exploring use of innovative financing instruments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $5,555,555, $5,000,000 of which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others) of ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, secretarial assistance, local transportation, and other in-\nkind contributions (use of warehouse facilities for collection, packaging, distribution as well as \nprovision of personal protective equipment to all distribution teams). Any TA scope expansion \nthrough partnerships between GOP, ADB, and philanthropic-private institutions will be explored \n \n4 All options for funds inclusion in the TA will be explored.  One option is for third parties to contribute cash \ndirectly to ADB to administer in support of the TA. ADB\u2019s Controllers\u2019 Department has set up separate \nbank accounts to receive financial contributions in pesos and United States dollars from third parties.  \nOther options include transfer of funds to a third party to administer on behalf of the Department of \nFinance (the executing agency) and ADB. Appropriate due diligence and documentation will be prepared \nto operationalize funding options.    \n5 Current DSWD estimates for a basic pack of critical food items for emergency support: a household of 5 \npeople, in a 2-day period: 6 kgs of rice, 4 tins tuna flakes, 5 coffee sachets, 2 tins sardines, 4 tins corned \nbeef, and 5 sachets powdered cereals. Under the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, paragraph \n98, technical assistance for disaster and emergency can provide critical components of early emergency \nassistance, including acquisition of critical supplies for basic services. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nfor increased impact.6 The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA on behalf of the GOP. Southeast Asia Regional Department \nwill  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  consultants.  ADB  may  also  utilize  consultants  already \nengaged under existing TA projects to support this TA. The executing agency (EA) will be the \nDepartment of Finance (DOF) with two implementing agencies (IAs):  DSWD and Department of \nthe Interior and Local Government (DILG). The strengths of each IA will be combined seamlessly \nfor implementation, including identifying essential food needs and qualities (DSWD) and assisting \nin targeting and distribution (DILG). DOF will ensure overall coordination, including with ADB. and \neffective use of public and private contributions (i.e. ensuring no overlaps between initiatives).  \n \n14.  A steering group established by the GOP, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-\n19, will provide policy guidance and oversight on TA implementation. The IATF comprises officials \nfrom the DOF, DSWD, DILG, and Department of National Defense (DND). Three subgroups within \nthe IATF will provide guidance on 3 separate aspects: finance, procurement, and logistics. \n \n15.  Procurement of goods and services (for output 3) under the TA will be undertaken by ADB, \ncoordinating with and receiving endorsements from the EA on all aspects (including composition \nof essential items, and targeting CIHH). All goods procured by ADB will be delivered directly (by \nsuppliers) to specified warehouse facility locations (under the DND) as instructed by the EA. The \ndesignated government agency under DND will be responsible to keep such goods under its \ncustody until delivery to beneficiaries. The designated government agency will be responsible for \nthe quality assurance and inspection certification of all goods before distribution. Warehousing, \npackaging, and distribution of goods procured will be managed by the DND and the Armed Forces \nof the Philippines all the way to impacted Barangays; Barangay captains will also be supported in \ndelivering to individual CIHH. As ADB will procure the goods and services (for output 3), direct \npayment method will be used to make payments to suppliers upon receipt by ADB of EA verified \nreports from (i) deliveries to warehouse, (ii) deliveries to Barangay nodes, and (iii) deliveries to \nindividual CIHH with (iv) ADB\u2019s coordinator (consultant) facilitating these reports as well as \nproviding third party verification.  \n \n16.

This could be substantially extended with private sector contributions, \nwith an aimed for additional $15 million (in cash or kind) contributions. This is set as an aspirational target, \ngiven  the  large-scale  income  and  livelihood  losses  from  the  much-needed  enhanced  quarantine \nmeasures.
