", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the Developing the Economic Cooperation Zone Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will serve as a catalyst for diversifying Mongolia\u2019s economy, integrating it into \nregional and global value chains, and increasing employment opportunities for the country\u2019s \npeople. The focus will be the Zamyn-Uud soum (district), where the busiest international border \nport between Mongolia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is located and the population \nrelies heavily on border traffic and trade activities.2 The project will support the development of \nan economic cooperation zone between Mongolia and the PRC. It will realize the untapped \neconomic potential of Mongolia\u2019s existing Zamyn-Uud free zone and its strategic position along \ncorridor 4 under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program. CAREC \ncorridors link the region\u2019s key economic hubs and connect landlocked CAREC countries such as \nMongolia with markets in Asia, Europe, and rest of the world.3 The project will generate economic \nand employment activities in Zamyn-Uud through (i) construction and operation of infrastructure \nand facilities in the free zone, (ii) promotion of sustainable operations and management of the \nfree zone, and (iii) establishment of a port of entry system within the free zone.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Endowed with considerable mineral resources, Mongolia\u2019s economy is highly dependent \non commodity exports. The mining sector contributes 24% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP), 70% of inward foreign direct investment, and 90% of its exports. Because of its narrow \neconomic  base,  Mongolia  suffers  from  boom-bust  economic  cycles  and  is  vulnerable  to \nfluctuations  in  global  commodity  prices  and  foreign  investment  inflows.  Economic  growth \naveraged 12.3% during the mining industry boom of 2011\u20132014 but plunged to 2.4% in 2015 and \n1.2% in 2016, before picking up in 2017\u20132019.5 The mining industry is capital intensive and only \ncontributes to 4% of employment. \n \n4.  International trade plays a critical economic role in Mongolia where the exports-to-GDP \nratio stands at 62%. Trade is conducted primarily via road and railway transport with its two \nneighboring countries (the PRC and the Russian Federation). However, Mongolia\u2019s exports are \nconstrained by the border delays, poor infrastructure, and weak regulatory environment that drive \nup its trade costs. Mongolia ranked 130th out of 160 countries in logistics performance in 2018 \n \n1  The project originally appeared as the Developing Cross-Border Economic Cooperation Zone Project in Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2019\u20132021. Manila. \n2  This document uses the most recent English-language spelling of the district name: Zamyn-Uud. The name is also \nsometimes spelled Zamiin-Uud. \n3  CAREC Corridor 4 connects Mongolia with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation. It \ncomprises three subcorridors: 4a in the western region of Mongolia, which serves road transit trade between the \nRussian Federation and the PRC and bilateral trade between the PRC and Mongolia; 4b, which provides both a \nhighway and a railway connection between the PRC and the Russian Federation through Ulaanbaatar; and 4c, which \nconnects the eastern region of Mongolia with the PRC by road. The Zamyn-Uud free zone is located in corridor 4b. \n4  A free zone is defined (under Mongolia\u2019s Law of Free Zones, as amended on 12 February 2015) as a part of the \nterritory of Mongolia that is deemed to fall outside the customs territory for the purposes of customs duties and other \ntaxes and adopts special treatment of business activity in such areas as customs and tax exemptions, ease of entry \nand exit customs control and clearance, and registration and employment within the zone.  \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Industry and Trade, and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \nand 117th out of 190 on ease of trading across borders in 2019.6 Empirical evidence suggests \nthat a 10% reduction of import time at the border could expand trade and raise the share of trade \nin Mongolia\u2019s GDP by 0.65 percentage points.7 Trade facilitation is thus crucial to improving \nMongolia\u2019s export competitiveness, growing the economy, and increasing employment.  \n \n5.  Pandemic impact. The unprecedented disruptions to the global economy due to the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)\u2014particularly  the  economic  slowdown  in  the  PRC\u2014are \nsignificantly affecting Mongolia\u2019s exports and economy. Mongolia\u2019s GDP growth is expected to \nfall sharply from 5.1% in 2019 to 2.1% in 2020.8 The COVID-19 outbreak has heightened \nMongolia\u2019s  need  to  facilitate  international  trade,  which  will  be  crucial  to  its  post-pandemic \neconomic recovery. An enabling environment is required for the private sector to maximize the \nimpact of the government\u2019s emergency stimulus package and adapt to the rapidly evolving global \neconomic and trade landscape. The development of an economic cooperation zone with project \nsupport  is  important to  this  effort.  By  providing  the  necessary  infrastructure,  facilities,  and \nsustainable operations and management capacity in the zone, the project is expected to enable \nthe private sector to build and improve production capacity and expand trade activities. In addition, \nthe travel restrictions, border closures, and stricter border controls imposed worldwide to slow \nCOVID-19\u2019s  spread  highlight  the  importance  of  strengthening  the  country\u2019s  resilience  to \ntransboundary health risks. Greater use of technology and stronger systems will equip Mongolia\u2019s \nborder agencies to better manage these risks, especially future pandemics, by enabling them to \nshare information with one another and with their counterparts in neighboring countries. The port-\nof-entry system to be established under the project will support this interagency and cross-border \ninteroperability  and  data  sharing,  particularly  on  customs,  immigration,  and  inspection \ninformation. Improved traceability and coordinated risk management will result, making the cross-\nborder movement of goods and people safer and more efficient.      \n   \n6.  Cross-border trade. As a member of CAREC since 2003, Mongolia is positioning itself \nas a transit and trade node between Northeast Asia and Europe. The government recognizes that \ntransforming Mongolia\u2019s inherent constraint as a landlocked country into an opportunity requires \nconcerted  efforts  to  facilitate  trade,  improve  physical  connectivity,  and  enhance  regional \ncooperation and integration (RCI).9 Mongolia will benefit from its connectivity and trade facilitation \nprojects along CAREC corridor 4, which traverses Mongolia\u2019s key border crossing points.10  \n \n7.  Free  zone  development.  Free  zone  development  is  one  of  Mongolia\u2019s  economic \ndiversification initiatives and will also strengthen Mongolia\u2019s participation in global and regional \nvalue chains.11 Industries established in the zones are expected to generate a variety of exports, \nranging from agricultural and manufacturing products to trade-related services.

The Office of the \nDeputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has oversight over the free zones, but each zone also has a \ngovernor\u2019s office that is responsible for managing its operations (footnote 4). \n \n8.  The Zamyn-Uud free zone. The Zamyn-Uud free zone is 780 kilometers southeast of \nUlaanbaatar and adjacent to the border crossing point at Zamyn-Uud. This is the largest and \nbusiest border crossing point on CAREC corridor 4 and where road, rail, and air transport \nnetworks meet. It is also the border crossing closest to Tianjin, the gateway port in the PRC for \nMongolia\u2019s shipments to Japan and the Republic of Korea. Under the framework of their 2011 \ncomprehensive strategic partnership, Mongolia and the PRC signed an agreement in June 2019 \nto establish the economic cooperation zone to connect Mongolia\u2019s Zamyn-Uud free zone with the \nPRC\u2019s Erenhot zone located in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.12 As Mongolia\u2019s largest \ntrading partner, the PRC was the recipient of 93% of Mongolia\u2019s exports and the source of 34% \nof Mongolia\u2019s imports in 2018. A substantial portion of this trade goes through the Zamyn-Uud \nborder crossing point.13 Developing the economic cooperation zone will reduce Mongolia\u2019s trade \ncosts and support its economic diversification. It will also benefit the district\u2019s population of 18,930, \nof which about 6,000 are women who cross the border daily to engage in informal trade.14 \n \n9.  Development challenges and the government\u2019s response. While the Zamyn-Uud free \nzone was established about 17 years ago, it has not become fully operational despite its strategic \nlocation (footnote 3) and investment incentives (footnote 4).15 Several physical and nonphysical \nconstraints limit the zone\u2019s development. First, the necessary infrastructure within the zone \nremains incomplete; and gaps are evident in the water, wastewater, heating, power, and road \nsystems.16 There is an urgent need to fill the infrastructure gaps and prepare a comprehensive \nfree zone master plan with appropriate zoning for different land uses to attract priority industries \nand services to locate within the zone.17 There is also a need for clear regulations for the \noperations and maintenance of the zone in order to instill business confidence in long-term \ninvestments. The Zamyn-Uud Free Zone Governor\u2019s Office (ZUFZGO) faces institutional and staff \n \n12 Joint Communique on Establishing Strategic Partnership Relationship between the PRC and Mongolia, issued on 17 \nJune 2011 in Beijing, PRC, which aims to promote connectivity, access, and economic and social cooperation. The \nagreement establishing the economic cooperation zone includes provisions on investment; intellectual property; \nbanking and finance; and areas of cooperation on environment, safety, protection and control, and social services.  \n13 The border crossing point handles traffic of about 3,100 passenger vehicles and 800 lorries per day. During 2015\u2013\n2018, the Zamyn-Uud border crossing point processed an annual average of 1,600 export and 37,721 import \ndeclarations with a combined total value of MNT521.3 million. ADB. 2019.

Improved coordination among border agencies is crucial to improve trade \ntransactions especially for zone operations.18 \n \n10.     The government is currently developing the Zamyn-Uud free zone through a phased \napproach. The initial phase, which will be the focus of the proposed project, will develop about \n300 hectares of the zone. The project will provide infrastructure to service each investor lot within \nthe project area through direct connections for water, wastewater, and heating utilities and power \ntransmission lines. In addition to improving physical infrastructure, the government will address a \nnumber of nonphysical impediments to more efficient trade and investment within the zone. This \nwill  involve  improving  the  transparency  and  predictability  of  the  application  of  laws  and \nregulations, including those governing special treatment of customs duties and employment within \nthe zone (footnote 4). There is a need to strengthen zone operations and management and to \nintegrate the systems maintained by border agencies responsible for customs, inspection, and \nimmigration.  Addressing  these  nonphysical  or  software  constraints,  including  the  use  of \ntechnology, will enable simplified clearance procedures, thereby facilitating movement of goods \nand people while improving surveillance and traceability within the economic cooperation zone.  \n \n11.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority of \nfostering RCI, particularly the Operational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering RCI, 2019\u20132024.19 The \nproject is also a priority under the CAREC Integrated Trade Agenda 2030.20 The project is \ndesigned to promote the use of innovative technology and strengthen policies and institutions and \nis classified as effective gender mainstreaming.21 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020 (pillar 2: developing infrastructure for economic \ndiversification) and ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021 (footnote \n1).22 \n \n12.  The project complements ongoing ADB-funded RCI projects in the Zamyn-Uud soum. The \nRegional  Improvement  of  Border  Services  Project  is  upgrading  the  Customs  Automated \nInformation System  of the Mongolian Customs General Administration to improve customs \nprocesses, including those at the border crossing point in Zamyn-Uud.23 Another project in \nZamyn-Uud is modernizing laboratories and inspection facilities to align Mongolia\u2019s sanitary and \nphytosanitary  measures  with  international  standards.24  The  Zamyn-Uud  Logistics  Center, \nfinanced by ADB and expected to be operational in 2020, will provide road\u2013road, road\u2013rail, and \nrail\u2013rail transshipment services and transport connections for a full range of cross-border trade \n \n18 Sharing by border agencies\u2014including sharing of customs agency data, systems, and analytics for activities such \nas facilitation, risk screening, and enforcement\u2014will facilitate business transactions and minimize processing times. \nMcKinsey  and  Company.  2019.

Mongolia: Regional Logistics Development Project. Manila. \n26 A market survey was conducted from July 2019 to September 2019 through focused group discussions involving \nseven free zone investors, consultation meetings with the Green Zone investment council (representing 28 investors), \nand questionnaires involving 20 non-investor companies. Interested investors are seeking to either produce goods \n(manufacturing, trade, and food processing) or provide services (travel, logistics and storage services, fuel stations, \nand construction). As of December 2019, 58 investors had been granted lease contracts in the Zamyn-Uud free \nzone. About 5 investors had started construction of their factories.  \n27 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n28 The project will determine and establish arrangements for the operation and maintenance of project facilities within \nthe zone. Consideration will be given to outsourcing business-related functions to private entity, introducing value-\nadded services, and funding mechanisms for the maintenance of zone facilities.  \n ", "6 \ndatabase. The database will promote interagency coordination by linking  the Customs Automated \nInformation System of  Mongolian Customs General Administration (para. 12) with the Inspection \nManagement System of the General Agency of Specialized Inspection and the Immigration \nSystem, which is a joint platform shared between the General Authority of Border Protection and \nthe Mongolia Immigration Agency. \n \n18.  Lessons. Lessons from Mongolia\u2019s past attempts to develop free zones (para. 9) and \nprevailing international good practices show a need for enabling infrastructure, a sound regulatory \nenvironment, good governance, and streamlined procedures.29 Interagency coordination and \nstrong partnership with the private sector are also crucial.30 The project reflects these lessons and \nprovides a holistic response to address the free zone\u2019s development needs, i.e., by combining \ninfrastructure (output 1) with capacity development and use of technology (outputs 2 and 3). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  Through this project, ADB will further strengthen Mongolia\u2019s role in RCI and participation \nin  the  CAREC  program\u2014particularly  the  CAREC  Integrated  Trade  Agenda  2030,  which \nconsolidates and coordinates trade-related initiatives and projects between 11 CAREC member \ncountries and their development partners (footnote 20). By addressing infrastructure gaps within \nthe zone and improving connectivity, ADB will help  Mongolia reduce trade costs. On the non-\nphysical side, ADB\u2019s experience in trade facilitation initiatives will support Mongolia\u2019s efforts to \nstreamline its trade procedures and integrate the inspection and surveillance systems of border \nagencies with the adoption of a single-window system for trade transactions (para. 12).31  \n \n20.  ADB has also been actively supporting Mongolian multisectoral institutions such as the \nNational Committee on Trade Facilitation and the National Council on Border Development. ADB \nwill  strengthen  coordination  with  the  development  partners  supporting  programs  in  road \ndevelopment, promotion of agricultural exports, and modernization of the standardization system. \nThese include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Union, \nand the World Bank. ADB will also cooperate with other development partners actively engaged \nin managing transboundary health risks and combating human trafficking and illegal trade.32  \n \nD.

The PSC, established in January \n2020, is chaired by the executing agency. The PSC will guide overall project implementation and \nmeet quarterly and as needed to approve annual budgets and plans. The project will have two \nimplementing agencies: the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development, and the ZUFZGO. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  the  quality  of  civil  works,  goods,  and  services  of \nconsultants; and safeguards compliance as specified in the PAM, including a gender action plan \nand the environmental management plan (EMP).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Based on the RCI assessment, the project is expected to generate regional economic \nbenefits and spillover effects. Physical infrastructure (output 1) and use of information and \ncommunication technology (output 3) will create time and cost savings for industries in the \ncooperation zone. The skills training and labor database for Mongolian nationals could help meet \nworkforce demand in both zones, and advisory and coordination will support Mongolia\u2019s bilateral \nagreement with the PRC (output 2). Economic benefits will result when investors begin activities \nin the zone. In this regard, economic analysis was carried out combining public investments \n(project costs) and private investments (set-up and operational costs using data from a limited \nsurvey extrapolated to the prospective investors). The estimated benefits are: (i) employment, (ii) \ntime  savings  from  movements  of  cargo  and  travelers,  and  (iii)  the  labor  value-added  of \nincremental trade to both the Mongolian economy and regional economic benefits.36 The project \nis found to be economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of up to 13.2% and an \neconomic net present value of MNT124.2 billion; and to remain economically viable when each \ncost and benefit parameter is separately and adversely varied by 10%.37 \n \n26.  The financial analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.38 By law, the \nzone\u2019s revenues go to national treasury and are not retained by the ZUFZGO. The financial \nanalysis was undertaken based on the incremental recurrent cost of the general government \nsector unit (the ZUFZGO) using 5-year historical performance and 10-year projections. Provisions \nfor (i) asset management of project facilities, and (ii) service-related costs were added to the total \nZUFZGO operating costs beginning in 2026, when the zone will be fully operational.39 Of these \nprovisions, recurrent costs were initially allocated for years 4 and 5 of the project to support early \noperations of the ZUFZGO. The total operating costs for ZUFZGO are projected at MNT5,486 \nmillion in 2026 and MNT7,523 million in 2030. The financial sustainability risk is assessed as \nsubstantial because of ZUFZGO\u2019s dependence on the state budget and the additional asset \nmanagement and service-related costs that will follow the project.40  \n \n27.  The  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability  risk  is  mitigated  by  its  low  fiscal  impact.  The \ngovernment expenditure, including counterpart funds and debt servicing, is calculated at less than \n0.05% of the government\u2019s fiscal budget throughout the 10-year period. Further, based on direct \nand indirect revenues arising from the free zone operations, a whole-of-government cash flow \nanalysis estimates that the zone will generate surpluses for the treasury from the 10th year of full \nzone operations. Once adopted, the public\u2013private partnership model developed under the \nproject\u2019s output 2 will include arrangements (such as ZUFZGO retaining a portion of the zone\u2019s \nrevenues for its operations and maintenance) that will reduce reliance on the state budget, \nimprove efficiency, and promote financially sustainable zone management.  \n \n \n36 Incremental trade is estimated as the value of incremental output, net of raw materials costs, produced by investor \ncompanies that are attracted to locate and operate within the zone as a result of the project. \n37 The Economic Analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB. 2017.

Sustainability \n  \n28.  Available  ADB-funded  technical  assistance  (footnotes  17  and  20)  will  complement \nmeasures to ensure project sustainability by providing options such as a management contract \nfor zone operations. The project has developed an EMP for the free zone operations, which \nrecommends environmentally suitable free zone operations such as prioritizing water-saving \nindustries and measures providing thresholds for water use, water-saving, and waste-water \nrecycling. The available water resources are sufficient to support zone operations within the \nproject area and the local community with the adoption of water-efficiency measures, which are \nincorporated in the project implementation arrangements.41  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.42 The executing agency has no independent accounting staff or system and is part of \nthe  Cabinet  Secretariat.  Accordingly,  the  assessment  was  undertaken  on  the  Cabinet \nSecretariat\u2019s Finance, Investment and Service Division and the two implementing agencies. The \nfinancial management risk is assessed as substantial. Both the Cabinet Secretariat and the \nZUFZGO  have  weak  in-house  financial  management  capacity  and  no  prior  experience  in \nimplementing ADB-funded projects. This is mitigated by the extensive experience in externally \nfunded  projects,  including  ADB  operations,  of  the    Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban \nDevelopment, a key implementing agency, and its qualified and experienced staff accountants. \nThe financial management action plan, detailed in the PAM, includes the following mitigating \nmeasures: (i) financial management training for the executing and implementing agencies; (ii) \nrecruitment of a PIU financial specialist with ADB project experience; (iii) the use of appropriate \nfinancial  management  systems,  including  financial  reporting  software;  and  (iv)  closer  ADB \nmonitoring and guidance. \n \n30.  The project procurement risk assessment, undertaken in accordance with ADB guidelines, \nassessed the overall procurement risk as medium.43 The key risks include lack of (i) a dedicated \nprocurement unit under the executing and implementing agencies, and (ii) experience with ADB \nproject procurement and implementation by the executing agency and ZUFZGO. To mitigate \nthese risks (i) a PIU procurement specialist with ADB experience will be recruited, (ii) high-risk \nand high-value contracts will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior review, and (iii) the executing and \nimplementing agencies and ADB will jointly undertake regular reviews of the project. Value-for-\nmoney will be achieved by using the lowest-evaluated cost together with appropriate qualification \nand technical requirements as the main evaluation criteria for procurement of goods and works, \nalong with scoring systems that emphasize quality in the case of consulting services. \n \n31.  No  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n \n41 Overall water availability for Zamyn-Uud is estimated at about 2,000 cubic meters per day. Based on potential \nindustrial and commercial use, water demand for the potential 58 investors that signified interest and/or leased land \nis 1,386 cubic meters per day (or 69% of available supply).  \n42 ADB. 2005.

The total will grow to 1,900 jobs after 10 years (footnote 37). This will benefit Zamyn-\nUud, where more than 2,000 labor-aged people are unemployed. About 32% of the population \nare women, most of whom are involved in informal trade.44 The project is categorized as effective \ngender  mainstreaming,  and  a  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  to  support  economic \nempowerment of women through (i) promotion of hiring of skilled women within the zone; (ii) pilot \nentrepreneurship training for women traders; (iii) assessment of a potential trader\u2019s market; (iv) \ndevelopment of a database to match investors with job seekers, especially unemployed women; \nand (v) enhanced gender awareness.45 In addition, the project will take an integrated approach to \nprevent human trafficking through (i) a biometric recognition system; and (ii) awareness and anti-\nhuman trafficking campaigns for relevant government agencies, investors, and local communities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.46 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination indicates that because \nof the nature and scale of the project\u2019s investment in civil works, adverse impacts during \nconstruction will be moderate and temporary and can be mitigated. Once the Zamyn-Uud free \nzone becomes operational, further impacts are expected from the economic activities of investors \ninside the zone and from operations of linked facilities (footnote 16). The EMP for zone operations \nhas been developed to avoid, minimize, and mitigate such impacts (para. 28).47 \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). There will be no land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement resulting from project land use. The Zamyn-Uud free zone is located on state-owned \nspecial purpose land, and civil works under the project will be within the existing right-of-way or \non government land allocated for such purposes under the 2011 free zone master plan. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no communities within the zone, and the \nproject location is not identified as hosting any ethnic groups.48  \n \nF.
