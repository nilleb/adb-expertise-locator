INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \ndevelopment  of  an  education  sector  master  plan  (ESMP)  in  Mongolia  through  capacity \ndevelopment, research and development, and policy advice aimed at improving the planning and \nmanagement of the education system. The Government of Mongolia has requested the TA from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop a long-term plan for the education sector that \nclearly maps the road toward the goals in Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030 (Vision \n2030).1 ADB provided technical assistance for the development of the first ESMP, 2006\u22122015 \nand its update, 2009\u22122015, and has been one of the major development partners in the education \nsector in Mongolia since the late 1990s. During the mission conducted in June 2017, ADB and \nthe government reached agreement on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, and consulting service requirements.2 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2017\u20132019.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s education sector underwent a decade of reforms (2004\u20132015) associated with \nthe restructuring of the education system from a 10-year (4+4+2) into a 12-year (5+4+3) system \nin line with international standards. During this reform period, the first ESMP, developed jointly by \nthe Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Sports (MECSS), development partners, and \nother stakeholders, guided and coordinated their interventions in the sector. There was also an \ninstitutionalized  mechanism  led  by  MECSS\u2014Education  Donors\u2019  Consultative  Mechanism \n(EDCM)\u2014to  review  progress  in  ESMP  implementation  and  discuss  issues  related  to  the \neducation sector with development partners. The ESMP and EDCM helped reduce overlaps and \nensure synergies between different interventions supported by development partners, increased \npredictability and sustainability in policy directions, and enhanced accountability. \n \n3.  The  EDCM,  however,  ceased  to  function  in  the  early  2010s  because  institutional \nleadership was lacking, and the first ESMP expired in 2015. Since then, no further education \nsector plan has been developed based on solid assessments and broad consultations with \ndevelopment partners. In addition, no mechanism has been in place for education stakeholders \nto gather, jointly review, and discuss progress and issues in the sector. Underlying is the \nfundamental issue\u2014weak capacity and systems to plan and manage the education sector based \non detailed studies and assessments and to make education policies and reforms more credible, \naccountable, and sustainable. This issue further involves inadequate staffing as well as frequent \nmanagement and staff turnover at MECSS and associated institutions.   \n \n4.  Mongolia\u2019s severe economic difficulties have amplified the negative effects of the lack of \nlong-term planning for the education sector. Although the kindergarten-aged population has been \ngrowing by 10%\u201325% annually since 2009, and the school-aged population by 8%, timely \ninvestments have not been made to meet the growing demand for education. As a result, the \nenrollment capacity of kindergartens and schools has been overstretched, resulting in large \nclasses with more than 30 students (occasionally 40\u201350 students) at schools and kindergartens, \nand schools operating in two and three shifts in Ulaanbaatar and some aimag (province) centers. \nUnless  long-term planning and forward-looking investments are made, progress in the net \nenrollment rates at pre-primary, primary, and junior secondary levels may be reversed, as the \n                                                 \n1  State Great Khural. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2016\u20132030. Ulaanbaatar. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 August 2017.  \n3  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2017\u20132019. Manila.  \n ", "2 \nkindergarten-aged  population  is  projected  to  grow  further  until  2019  and  the  school-aged \npopulation until 2025.4 The lack of long-term planning also led to difficulties with the introduction \nof  elective  courses  at  senior  secondary  level\u2014the  key  reform  action  in  senior  secondary \neducation\u2014in the school year 2016/17, especially at small schools with only a handful of students \nat senior secondary level (grades 10\u201312). The delays in the reform of senior secondary education \nhave slowed down the reform of other areas in pre-primary, primary, junior, and senior secondary \neducation, such as curriculum, student learning assessment, teaching and learning materials, \npre-service and in-service teacher training, school leadership, and evaluation. A new loan is \nincluded in the country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2017\u22122019 to mitigate these \nnegative effects and support forward-looking investments. \n \n5.  Sluggish economic growth has also accentuated the importance of skills and human \nresource  development  that  responds  to  and  anticipates  labor  market  needs.  As  youth \nunemployment rates rise, poor employability of senior secondary and higher education graduates \nhas increasingly become an issue. Likewise, as the current economic difficulties have highlighted \nthe need for investments in science, technology, and innovation to diversify the economy, \nstrengthening  research  and  development  in  higher  education  and  developing  science  and \ntechnology  human  resources  have  become  a  priority.  Addressing  these  issues  requires  a \nconcerted effort in the long run.  \n \n6.  Vision 2030, approved by the Parliament in 2016, sets out broad directions and goals for \nthe education sector until 2030 in line with Sustainable Development Goal 4. However, no detailed \nplan exists at present that defines concrete actions in a rational sequence to attain the goals of \nVision 2030, nor does a credible and comprehensive expenditure framework. Moreover, the lack \nof an evidence-based, long-term education sector plan means that the operations of development \npartners are uncoordinated. The joint development of a new ESMP by MECSS and its associated \ninstitutions, development partners, and other stakeholders can fill the gap, while opening up new \npossibilities for adopting a sector-wide programmatic approach to education sector development \nin Mongolia.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: access to, and quality and relevance of \neducation  improved  (footnote  1).  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  planning  and \nmanagement of the education system strengthened.5  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  The TA will have three outputs that correspond to three phases of ESMP development, \nas follows.  \n  \n9.  Output  1:  Management  and  coordination  mechanisms  for  ESMP  development \nestablished (Phase I). The TA will support the establishment of mechanisms to plan, manage, \nand coordinate the process of ESMP development, based on a rapid assessment of institutional \narrangements  and  capacity  in  the  education  sector,  and  in  consultation  with  development \n                                                 \n4  The net enrollment rate in the school year 2015/16 was 75.1% at pre-primary level, 96.3% at primary level, 98.1% at \njunior secondary level, and 68.7% at senior secondary level.  \n5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \npartners\u2014Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); United Nations Educational, Scientific, \nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO); United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF); the World Bank; \ninternational  and  national  nongovernment  organizations\u2014and  other  stakeholders.  The \nmechanisms, to be led by MECSS, will comprise (i) a project management unit to provide \nmanagement, coordination, and logistics support for MECSS throughout phases I\u2212III; (ii) a core \ntechnical team to coordinate technical sub-teams and their inputs for in-depth studies and reviews, \nand public consultations; and to prepare a draft ESMP, policy simulations, and expenditure \nframework;6 and (iii) the EDCM to review and endorse plans, studies, and frameworks, and other \ndocuments to be developed throughout phases I\u2212III. A detailed work plan with clear roles and \nresponsibilities for each institution involved, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for the \nimplementation of the work plan will be developed by (i) mapping education policy and reform \nactions  undertaken  and  planned  by  MECSS,  and  ongoing  and  planned  education  sector \noperations of development partners; (ii) taking stock of studies and assessments conducted by \nMECSS and development partners in 2015\u20132017 as well as global study reports on trends in the \neducation sector and 21st century competencies;7 (iii) determining the scope of the ESMP and \nareas in which to conduct in-depth studies and reviews; and (iv) agreeing on a task allocation \nbetween  the  institutions  involved,  key  milestones,  and  joint  monitoring  and  evaluation \nmechanisms.  \n \n10.  Output 2: In-depth education sector studies and reviews of international experience \nand  lessons  completed  (Phase  II).  The  TA  will  support  in-depth  studies  and  reviews  of \ninternational experience and lessons in the areas defined in the detailed work plan. These will \ninclude studies and reviews of higher education, junior and senior secondary education, and other \nareas identified under output 1 from the perspectives of access, quality, relevance, and equity, \nand with an emphasis on student learning and labor market outcomes. International experience \nand lessons will be assessed through literature and desk reviews of policies and reforms that \nhelped improve access, quality and relevance of teaching and learning, student learning and labor \nmarket outcomes, and equity in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development. The TA will also build the capacity of MECSS and associated institutions \nengaged in the technical core team and sub-teams to collect and analyze data by organizing \ntraining and seminars. Findings and recommendations of in-depth studies and reviews will be \npresented and discussed at meetings and workshops organized through the management and \ncoordination mechanisms established under output 1.  \n \n11.  Output 3: ESMP and expenditure framework developed (Phase III). The TA will \nsupport the identification of priority policy and reform actions, physical investments, institutional \ncapacity development, and their sequencing with a view to improving student learning and labor \nmarket outcomes in accordance with Vision 2030 and through broader public consultations. \nBased on the priorities and sequences identified, and several macroeconomic and demographic \nscenarios, the TA team will perform policy simulations and develop a medium-term expenditure \nframework that includes ongoing and planned funding of development partners. The draft ESMP, \npolicy simulations, and expenditure framework will be presented and discussed at meetings and \nworkshops organized through the management and coordination mechanisms. The TA will also \n                                                 \n6 The core technical team will include representatives from the Institute of Education, Institute of Teachers Professional \nDevelopment, Education Evaluation Center, Mongolia State University of Education, National University of Mongolia, \nand development partners.  \n7  Include studies and assessments conducted under ADB\u2019s ongoing TA projects (ADB. 2015.

The key risk to achieving the outcome lies in leadership changes in the government that \nmay jeopardize the institutional mechanisms for managing, coordinating, and monitoring ESMP \nimplementation. Inadequate staffing and frequent management and staff turnover at MECSS and \nassociated institutions, on the other hand, may slow down TA implementation, which is seen as \nthe major risk to the development of the three outputs.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. Key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. Ineligible expenditures include (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) salaries for civil \nservants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering design, \n(vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or \nNegative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.8 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, data, information and relevant documents, and other in-\nkind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. It will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and \ncoordinate with JICA; UNESCO; UNICEF; the World Bank; and nongovernment organizations \nuntil the management and coordination mechanisms are established under output 1. MECSS \nwill be the executing and implementing agency and will be responsible for providing guidance \nand  support  to  consultants  engaged  under  the  TA  and  to  all  institutions  involved  in  TA \nimplementation as part of the technical core team and sub-teams, or the EDCM, such as Institute \nof Education, Institute of Teachers Professional Development, Education Evaluation Center, \nuniversities, metropolitan and aimag education departments, schools, lifelong learning centers, \ndevelopment partners, nongovernment organizations, and other stakeholders. A project steering \ncommittee, chaired by the state secretary of MECSS and comprising the directors of MECSS \nand representatives of institutions, will be established to review implementation progress and \nprovide guidance on a quarterly basis. The TA will be implemented from October 2017 to October \n2019. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2017\u2013October 2019  \nExecuting and implementing agency  MECSS \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Quality- and cost- 24 person-months  $288,800 \nbased selection \n  Individual consultant  32 person-months  $296,800 \nselection \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2011.

Consulting services. ADB will engage a consulting firm (international, 4 person-months; \nnational,  20  person-months)  to  provide  expertise  in  planning  and  management  of  ESMP \ndevelopment throughout the three phases, while serving as a project management unit. The \nconsulting firm will be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 90:10, and simplified technical proposal. ADB will also engage individual consultants \n(4 international specialists, 10 person-months; 4 national specialists, 22 person-months) in \nphases II and III as part of the technical sub-teams to provide expertise on secondary education, \nhigher education, and other areas identified under output 1. Output-based, lump-sum contracts \nwith a provision for fixed out-of-pocket expenditures will be considered for the consulting firm and \nindividual consultants. ADB will engage consulting firms and individual consultants in accordance \nwith ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated project \nadministration instructions and TA staff instructions.9  \n \n16.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, the consultants will submit an inception report, a midterm report, a draft final \nreport, and a final report to ADB and MECSS. The main mechanism to monitor and assess the \nTA will be review missions jointly conducted by ADB and MECSS.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nSupporting the Development of an Education Sector Master Plan, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n \n                   \n                 \n                                                 \n9 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nAccess to, and quality and relevance of education improved (Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision \n2030)a \n   Performance Indicators    Data Sources and   \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020     \nPlanning and  a.
