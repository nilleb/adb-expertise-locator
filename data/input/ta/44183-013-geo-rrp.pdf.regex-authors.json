I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Georgia for the Regional Power Transmission Enhancement Project.1 \n \n2.  Georgia  is  endeavoring  to  develop  a  regional  power  market  comprising  Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, and Turkey, with Georgia serving as a transmission hub and as a seasonal exporter \nof  environmentally  clean  hydropower.  To  achieve  this,  in  addition  to  the  development  of \nhydropower  and  cross-border  transmission  facilities,  investments  are  required  to  upgrade \nsystem operation reliability and efficiency, and enhance transmission capacity. The project will \ninclude three main components: (i) substation rehabilitation and improvement, (ii) construction \nof a new Khorga 220/110-kilovolt (kV) substation, and (iii) consulting services.2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n1.  Sector Overview \n3.  Georgia has made significant progress in energy sector reforms over the past 10 years \nto address chronic power shortages and the poor financial condition of electricity companies. \nDuring the 1990s, the sector experienced major technical and commercial challenges following \nthe breakup of the former Soviet Union and a general collapse in payments within the sector. In \n1996, the existing utility was unbundled into separate generation, transmission, and dispatch \ncompanies.  The  distribution  was  split  between  municipal  and  regional  companies.  Further \nreforms followed with the consolidation of regional distribution companies and the introduction of \nmanagement contractors to manage the unified distribution company. The privatization of power \ngeneration and distribution has improved management of operations. Most of the generation \nassets have been privatized with the exception of the Enguri hydropower plant (HPP), the \nlargest HPP with an installed capacity of 1,300 megawatts (MW). It supplies about half of the \ncountry\u2019s electricity needs. Distribution is fully privatized to foreign strategic investors. \n \n4.  Georgian  State  Electrosystem  (GSE)  is  a  100%  state-owned  joint  stock  company \nproviding  transmission  and  exclusive  dispatch  services  to  about  50  eligible  companies  in \nGeorgia. GSE owns most of the transmission grid including the 220 kV and 110 kV lines and \npart of the 35 kV networks used for transmission services. GSE is also responsible for operation \nof the transmission system and owns the national dispatch center.  \n \n5.  The reliability of electricity services has improved significantly due to investments in \nenergy infrastructure and maintenance. Financial viability has strengthened with tariff reforms, \nimproved revenue collection, and reduced quasi-fiscal deficits in the sector. Retail tariffs for \nresidential  customers  are  set  close  to  full  cost  recovery  but  cross-subsidization  persists.3 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Preparing the Regional Power \nTransmission Enhancement Project. Manila. \n3  The Georgian National Energy and Water Regulatory Commission, the independent regulator, sets tariffs following \nmethodology and procedures set out in its Resolution No. 3, issued on 1 July 1998. The current tariffs for \nresidential customers are GEL0.135\u2013GEL0.177 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), equivalent to $0.075\u2013$0.099 per kWh; \nthese are reasonable by international and regional standards. ", "2   \nCollection rates increased to 95% in 2011. Since 2006, network losses have been reduced \nsubstantially, but remain high by international standards.4 \n \n6.  The  country  possesses  tremendous  untapped  hydropower  resources.  Currently, \nhydropower generation accounts for over 85% of annual energy output. Its hydropower potential \nis estimated at up to 80 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, of which up to 60 TWh are economically \nfeasible. The current system comprises about 60 HPPs with maximum output capability of 8.0\u2013\n9.5 TWh per year, i.e. 15% of the economically feasible potential. \n \n7.  Since  2007,  generation  production  has  surpassed  the  annual  demand,  due  to  the \nrehabilitation of existing HPPs, improvement in the efficiency of energy use, and reduction of \nlosses.  Currently, Georgia has power trade with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and the Russian \nFederation.  In  2011, Georgia  exported  0.93 TWh of  electricity,  accounting for  10%  of the \ncountry\u2019s total electricity generation.5 \n \n8.  In 2008, the Government of Georgia launched a large hydropower investment promotion \ncampaign and has since awarded a number of concession agreements for HPP construction. By \n2016\u20132017, 1,400 MW of new HPPs are estimated to be added to the existing 2,510 MW of \nHPPs, providing an additional 3.8 TWh of capacity available for export at an economic value to \nGeorgia of $300 million per year.6 Of Georgia\u2019s potential export markets, Turkey is the most \nattractive given its summer peak in demand, projected capacity shortfalls, and high market \nprices.7 Transit trade from Armenia and Azerbaijan to Turkey is also possible. Power transit \nthrough Turkey would mean that the rich energy resources in the Caucasus could eventually be \nexported to the European market. Georgia could therefore act as a regional hub for energy \ndispatch and transit through the Caucasus area. \n \n2.  Key Problems and Constraints \n9.   To develop the hydropower potential and expand power export, and especially to attract \nprivate sector capital for these investments, two critical technical issues need to be resolved:  \n(i) ensure the stability, reliability, and efficiency of Georgia\u2019s power transmission system; and  \n(ii) enlarge the transmission capacity and provide market access to the most promising export \nmarkets for surplus power. \n \n10.   The government has entered into agreements with neighboring countries to enhance \nand develop transmission infrastructure and interconnection facilities to expand power trade. \nNew  cross-border  interconnection  lines  with  adjacent  countries  are  scheduled  for \ncommissioning  in  2013\u20132015. 8  At  present,  domestic  transmission  network  capacity  is \ninadequate and the operating system remains unstable and unreliable, increasing the potential \n                                                \n4  The total transmission losses were reduced from 2.7% in 2006 to 1.9% in 2011. The total distribution losses in 2011 of \nvarious distribution companies were 16.0%\u201327.0%. \n5  In 2011, Georgia\u2019s export market shares are the Russian Federation, 63%; Turkey, 23%; Armenia, 13%; and Azerbaijan, \n1%. Power exports were during the summer when Georgia had excess hydro outputs and imports were during winter. \nTotal electricity imports in 2011 were 0.47 TWh, with 95% from the Russian Federation and 5% from Azerbaijan. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Wholesale electricity prices in Turkey have been steadily increasing and are now among the highest among energy \ncommunity members. In 2011, the average wholesale electricity price in Turkey was \u20ac0.08 per kWh ($0.0102 per kWh). \n8  The Black Sea Transmission Network Project, a 500/400 kV interconnection line between Georgia and Turkey, which will \nadd 1,050 MW of additional interconnector capacity with Turkey, is ongoing and scheduled to be completed in 2013\u20132017 \nin three phases. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, and German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW are financing the project. The new 500 kV interconnection line between Georgia \nand Azerbaijan was completed in 2011. A new 400 kV interconnection line between Georgia and Armenia is \nplanned. \n ", "3 \nrisk of frequent system blackouts.9 This constrains existing and future power swaps or export \npotential. Since 2008, considerable investments were spent to rehabilitate existing substation \nfacilities, mainly in primary equipment. However, the protection systems and substation control \nsystems supported by electromagnetic analogue technology are obsolete; they were installed \n30\u201350 years ago and have serious problems meeting operating and technical requirements. \nAny fault on the existing transmission lines will result in a large power deficit in populated areas \nand  have  considerable  social  and  economic  impacts.10 To  reduce  such  impacts,  more \ninvestment is urgently required for substation rehabilitation and enhancement of transmission \nfacilities. \n \n11.  The Georgian power system has a significant generation-load regional imbalance: two-\nthirds of the energy resources are located in the northwest, while two-thirds of domestic demand \nis located in the east. Additionally, most of the potential export market is located to the south. \nThe  major  potential  export  market,  i.e.  Turkey,  is  experiencing  rapid  growth  in  electricity \ndemand. Other countries, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan, while experiencing modest or at \ntimes zero demand growth are likely to avail of a relatively cheap supply of hydropower from \nGeorgia to augment and offset thermal and thermal-nuclear power generation. Power delivery to \nthese markets requires a reliable high-voltage transmission network. \n \n12.  The  new  Khorga  substation,11 together  with  other  ongoing  transmission  investment \nprojects,  will  improve  the  reliability  of  the  grid  and  quality  of  the  power  supply.  The  new \nsubstation will increase transmission capacity by an additional 400 megavolt-amperes (MVA), \nstrengthening  and  stabilizing  the  transmission  network  operation.  It  will  guarantee  stable \ntransmission of energy produced at Enguri HPP to the industrial zone of Poti and to Turkey \nthrough Batumi substation. In addition, it will help stabilize transmission power flows providing \nadditional event redundancy and lowering the incidence of outages. As energy trading between \nGeorgia and Turkey stabilizes, the risk of incurring power trade contract penalties decreases. \n \n13.  To accelerate hydropower development, the government asked the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  consider  financing  a  run-of-the-river  HPP  with  40\u201350  MW  capacity.  The \ngenerated power will be required to meet the increased demand of domestic water utilities due \nto rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply system.12 Part of the generation may be \nexported to neighboring countries.  \n \n3.  Sector Policy and Priorities \n14.  The government recognizes that the development priority for power is the  effective \ndevelopment and utilization of rich hydropower resources.13 The energy sector policy has a \nstrong  focus  on  (i)  efficient  utilization  of  power  resources;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  existing \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  facilities;  (iii)  interconnection  with  neighboring \ncountries  to  promote  energy  trade,  including  transit;  and  (iv)  attraction  of  investment  and \nprivatization. \n \n                                                \n9  GSE system blackouts totaled 8 and 2 times, respectively, in 2010 and 2011\u2014high by international standards. \n10 In 2007, undelivered energy due to system faults totaled 1.2 gigawatt-hours, representing a loss to Georgia of \n$706,000 per annum. \n11 The Khorga substation is located near Khorga village in Khobi district of Samegrelo region in west Georgia. \n12 ADB is providing a multitranche financing facility for $500 million to support Georgia\u2019s urban water supply and \nsanitation sector development plan over 8 years from 2011 to 2020. \n13 The government\u2019s power policy is set out in the Main Directions of State Policy in the Power Sector of Georgia, \napproved by Parliament on 7 June 2006. \n ", "4   \n15.  Due to its geographic location, the government aims to establish Georgia to act as a \ntransit country for import\u2013export and transit operations of energy carriers in the Caucasus \nregion. This will move the Caucasus countries closer to establishing a regional power market to \nfacilitate flexible and mutually profitable cross-border energy exchanges. It will eventually result \nin regional energy resources being used in an efficient and environment-friendly way. \n \n4.  ADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n \n16.  Under  Strategy  2020,  ADB  will  support  regional  cooperation  activities  to  foster \naccelerated economic growth.14 ADB will help its member countries realize growth through \nintegration and closer links with their neighbors. The project is in line with ADB's strategy for \nGeorgia,  which focuses  on  upgrading  and  developing  energy  infrastructure  and  enhancing \nregional energy trade by developing the Caucasus regional energy market.15 \n \n17.  ADB has not had lending in Georgia\u2019s energy sector in relation to sovereign operations; \nthe project provides a unique opportunity for ADB to enter the sector. Presently, government \nfunding is not sufficient on the scale needed for expanding and rehabilitating the power system. \nADB\u2019s involvement will contribute to filling the funding gap and enhance the confidence of the \nprivate sector in investing in power. In addition, the project will complement other ADB support \nfor infrastructure, including the development of the transport and water supply sectors. \n \n18.  ADB will work with the government and development partners to improve the structural, \nlegal,  and  regulatory  framework  needed  to  attract  private  sector  funding  in  the  sector. \nSubstantial progress in sector reforms and strong improvements in the efficiency of power \noperations  have  been  achieved.  This  has  generated  strong  commitment  among  the \ndevelopment community to continue supporting the sector through project financing, institutional \nreforms, and capacity building.16 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The project is an integral part of Georgia\u2019s power development plan and the selected \ncomponents are under GSE\u2019s investment priorities. The project objective is to enhance regional \npower trade by (i) rehabilitating and improving 11 existing substations, and (ii) constructing a \nnew substation. \n \n20.  The project impact will be the contribution to expanding Georgia\u2019s power trade in the \nCaucasus region. Net power exports are expected to increase from 10% of domestic power \ngeneration (2011) to 20% by 2019. The project outcome will be a reliable, stable, and efficient \npower operating system to meet increasing demand for power export and transit. \n \nC.  Outputs \n21.  The project outputs consist of the following components: \n \n(i)  Substation  rehabilitation  and  improvement.  Rehabilitate  11  existing \nsubstations by installing modern digital control and relay protection systems to \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2008.

Investment and Financing Plans \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $67 million. The investment plan is summarized in  \nTable  1.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR \n30,981,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will have \na term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with interest at 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. The government will be the borrower for the ADB loan \nand relend it to GSE (excluding $2 million for the hydropower project study) on similar terms and \nconditions as the ADB loan. GSE will assume the foreign exchange risk.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amount   \nA.  Base Cost     \n  1.

Implementation Arrangements \n24.  GSE will be the executing agency for the project, except for the study on potential \nhydropower investment projects, where the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MOENR) \nwill be the executing agency. \n \n25.  The procurement capacity assessment revealed that GSE and MOENR have adequate \ncapacity but have limited experience with ADB procedures. Several transmission and substation \nrehabilitation projects funded by other international development partners, such as the World \nBank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, \nand German development cooperation through KfW are under implementation with satisfactory \nperformance. Goods and works to be financed under the project will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).18 ADB approved \nadvance procurement action for procurement and consultants. The government and executing \nagencies have been advised that approval of advance procurement does not commit ADB to \nfinance the project. \n \n26.  GSE will recruit a consulting firm to support the existing Project Management Unit with \nproject  supervision  and  management. In  addition,  MOENR  will  recruit  a  consulting firm  to \nundertake the feasibility study and safeguards due diligence on potential hydropower projects. \nAll consulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n27.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n28.  The  current  Georgian  power  operating  system  remains  unstable  and  unreliable. \nRehabilitation and improvement of substation facilities through the installation of modern digital \ncontrol and protection systems will significantly improve system reliability and security. The \nprotection  system  is  to  isolate  any  short  circuits  that  may  occur  in  the  system  in  a  time \ncompatible with the security of the power system. During short circuits, the condition of the \ntransmission system is unstable. The system must be returned to a stable situation as soon as \npossible by isolating the short circuit. Ongoing instablity may lead to a voltage collapse and a \nregional or system blackout. Rehabilitation of substation facilities not only helps GSE deliver \npower  reliably  and  safely  to  customers  but  also  reduces  transmission  losses  and  lowers \noperating costs. The new Khorga substation will enhance transmission capacity to meet the \nincreasing demand in the western part of Georgia, while the additional capacity will contribute to \npower transmission in the main grid. A reliable and stable power transmission system is a \nprecondition  for  efficient  regional  power  trade  as  well  as  investments  in  hydropower \ndevelopment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n29.  A financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines.19 \nAll financial costs and benefits are expressed at constant 2012 prices. Cost streams used to \ndetermine  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  i.e.  capital  investment,  operation  and \nmaintenance, and taxes, reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. \n \n30.  The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is 3.8%, which compares favorably with the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 0.2%, indicating expected financial viability for the \nproject. Financial viability was gauged by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \nwith-project and without-project investment scenarios. The incremental benefits arise from GSE \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8   \nrevenues in Georgia as well as those accruing to the region, i.e. to Turkey from additional \nrevenues generated from the ability to export. Regional financial benefits such as additional \nrevenues generated in neighboring countries are not included in the financial evaluation. \n \n31.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  13.4%  compares  favorably  with  the  12.0% \nopportunity cost of capital in the country; this fully justifies investment in the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n32.   ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and GSE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \n33.  GSE has adequate capacity to manage funds flow under the project. Until 2006, GSE \noperated at a significant loss, and was nearly bankrupt because of the failure of customers to \npay their bills. To avert bankruptcy, in 2008 GSE entered into a legally binding rehabilitation \nplan with its creditors, mainly the Ministry of Finance. The plan sets out plans for investment and \noperating  expenditure  and  a  schedule  of  debt  repayment  in  15  years.  Revenue  collection \nproblems have been resolved since 2007; GSE has collected most of the invoiced amounts. \nGSE reported a profit of GEL19.4 million in 2011.   \n \n34.  GSE  has  experience  in  managing  externally  financed  projects,  and  maintains  its \naccounting and reporting procedures according to international financial reporting standards. \nThe government has committed to specific financial performance for GSE. Periodic tariff reviews \nwill  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor  financial  performance  to  achieve  long-term \nsustainability, and to ensure that the project does not have an adverse fiscal impact on GSE \nand  the  government.  Financial  management  risks  are  assessed  low  after  proposed  risk \nmitigation measures. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n35.  By increasing the supply of efficient and reliable electricity to the system, the project will \nincrease  the  reliability  of  the  power  supply  nationwide,  benefiting  the  poor  and  neglected \nregions.  Since  the  rural  poor  are  the  first  to  be  cut  off  from  supply  during  winter  power \nshortages,20 system loss reduction and stronger supply reliability will particularly benefit the poor \nand the socially excluded. Women, who are mainly responsible for household tasks in Georgian \nfamilies, will especially benefit from reliable power supply to households. The project will provide \nequal opportunities for female staff to avail of training opportunities required to operate the \nsupervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system.  The  project  will  also  benefit  hydropower \ndevelopment and enhance regional power export, which will stimulate economic growth and \nincrease employment opportunities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n36.  Environmental assessment. Only the construction of Khorga substation will involve \nphysical activities that could potentially result in environmental impacts. The project is classified \nunder environment category B. An initial environmental examination, including an environmental \nmanagement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), was prepared \n                                                \n20 Currently, no power supply deficits (around 5% of the total domestic demand) during the winter have to be \nbalanced from imports. \n ", "9 \nand adopted by the government.21 No significant natural habitats will be affected by the Khorga \nsubstation development due to its location within an area where the natural habitat has been \nhighly modified by recent agricultural activities and human settlement. Overall, the project will \ngenerate only minor environmental impacts that can be reduced to acceptable levels through \nimplementation  of  practical  mitigation  measures  normally  associated  with  internationally \nrecognized good engineering practice. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement. Of all the project components, only the construction of the \nKhorga substation will entail land acquisition and resettlement impacts. These impacts  are \nminor. The area required for the substation belongs to the government and no land acquisition \nwill be needed. However, three encroacher families, with no legal rights, cultivate the area. \nThese families will be provided with compensation for the crop income they lose in 2013, and \nwith allowances for severe impacts and for vulnerable people (the families lose more than 10% \nof their income and are registered as poor  by the province\u2019s Social Services Office). The \nresettlement plan, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), was prepared \nand adopted by the government.22 \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples. No indigenous people live in the project area. The project will not \ntrigger indigenous peoples safeguards in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The project classification is C. No indigenous peoples development plan is required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.  The  government  fully  supports  the  project.  MOENR  will  coordinate  the  work  of \ngovernment  agencies  to  ensure  that  issues,  if  any,  are  resolved  promptly.  Technologies \nadopted  under  the  project  conform  to  international  standards  and  best  practices  that  are \ncommercially  proven  and  widely  used  internationally.  GSE  has  significant  experience  in \nmanaging projects in cooperation with international financial institutions. However, it remains \nresource-constrained and its ability to manage multiple large projects is uncertain without the \nsupport of external international expertise. Another potential risk relates to GSE\u2019s financial \nposition:  a  low  ratio  of  available  cash  from  operations  to  current  capital  expenditure \ncommitments and future debt service obligations, implying continued reliance by GSE on debt to \nfund capital expenditures with little ability to contribute from its own cash reserves. Risks have \nbeen analyzed and deemed acceptable or mitigated. Major risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGSE has limited project management  International consultants will undertake project design, bidding \ncapacity and lacks experience with  preparation support, and evaluation.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n40.  The government and GSE have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n41.  The government and GSE have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n42.
