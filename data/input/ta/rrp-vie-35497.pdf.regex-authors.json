Environmental implications were reviewed and no \nAssessment  significant environmental impact was identified. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  sustainable \nhousing  finance  market  in  Viet  Nam,  which  would  ultimately \nmobilize substantial capital for housing finance and facilitate the \nlong-term  establishment  of  a  strong  mortgage-based  collateral \nmarket to provide housing loans to all sections of the population. \nThe loan will be used as a line of credit to the State Bank of Viet \nNam  (SBV)  for  refinancing  housing  loans  originated  by \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs) for urban low-income and \npoor households (ULIPHs) through a newly established housing \nfinance  facility  (HFF).  The  Project  will  assist  approximately \n137,000  urban  low-income  and  poor  persons  improve  their \nhousing,  health  standards,  and  economic  well-being  by  giving \nthem  access  to  affordable  housing  finance.  For  the  poor \nhouseholds that cannot afford to buy a new house, the Project will \nprovide market-based lending for housing improvement and own-\nbuild  options  through  community-based  financial  institutions \n(CFIs).  \n   \nRationale  Rapid population growth and rural-urban migration have created \nserious problems in access to housing in the urban centers of Viet \nNam. Almost 40% of households in urban areas occupy a usable \nhousing area of less than 36 square meters (m2), with 16% of \nhouseholds occupying an area of less than 24 m2. The majority of \nthe population live in semipermanent houses. Only 26% of urban \nhouseholds  have  permanent  housing  types  and  20%  have \ntemporary, unstable structures. The problem affects particularly \nULIPHs who lack access to affordable options to finance their \nhouse improvements or new housing in the absence of an efficient \nhousing finance system.  \n \nThe lack of access to long-term credit funds prevents financial \ninstitutions from providing long-term loans for housing. The lack of \nlong-term loans makes access to housing finance unaffordable for \nalmost 65% of the urban population. Short-term loans require high \ndebt  service  repayment.  To make  housing  loans  affordable  to \nULIPHs, it is necessary to establish an efficient housing finance \nsystem  that  can  provide  long-term  financing  for  purchase  of \nhousing and financing options for the poor to upgrade or build \ntheir own house. \n \n ", "iv   \nThe development of an efficient housing mortgage market in Viet \nNam  requires  the  establishment  of  a  HFF  that  will  refinance \nhousing loans originated by qualified PFIs. HFF will be initially \nestablished within SBV and would become the apex institution for \nhousing finance in Viet Nam. In the long term, HFF will become an \nindependent mortgage refinance agency (MRA) that would act as \na conduit to attract additional funds to the sector through the issue \nof bonds or securities. All loans to PFIs will be channeled through \nHFF,  which  will  act  as  a  refinance  facility  (revolving  fund)  in \ncharge of disbursement to the PFIs and repayments on a regular \nbasis.  The  establishment  of  a  HFF  is  justified  to  (i)  promote \ncommon  standards,  procedures,  documentation,  and  good \npractices among PFIs for the development of an efficient and \ntransparent primary mortgage market accessible to ULIPHs; and \n(ii) build up basic requirements for the emergence of a secondary \nmortgage market. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan is \nneeded to (i) provide initial resources to HFF to start its operations \non a pilot basis; and (ii) provide capacity-building activities for HFF \nand PFIs, with the objective of developing human resources in the \nnational housing finance sector. The establishment of HFF will \nprovide an opportunity to test mechanisms for loan disbursement \nto ULIPH, and act as a catalyst to facilitate the progress of policy \nand legal reforms in the sector.  \n \nADB\u2018s involvement in housing finance is justified to (i) develop the \ninstitutional and policy framework for a housing finance system \nthat  integrates  housing  and  finance  issues;  (ii) make  housing \nloans affordable to ULIPHs and so reduce poverty and enhance \nthe quality of their life; and (iii) create employment and business \nopportunities in the construction, and banking sectors. \n \n   \nObjectives   The Project\u2019s goal is to improve the quality of life for ULIPHs \nthrough improved housing. The specific objective of the Project is \nto  promote  the  establishment  in  Viet  Nam  of  a  sustainable \nhousing finance market accessible to ULIPHs. The Project will \nprovide  approximately  27,500  housing  finance  loans  for  over \n137,000  people,  disbursed  through  PFIs,  in  the  first  round  of \nlending. The Project consists of three parts: (i) mortgage lending \nto urban low-income households through participating commercial \nbanks (PCBs), (ii) housing microfinance to urban poor households \nthrough  CFIs,  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding. The Project will support the establishment of a HFF that \nwill become the apex institution for the housing finance sector, \nand the implementation of a policy and institutional reform action \nplan that will facilitate the development of the housing finance \nsystem.   \n \n   ", "  v\nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $51.8  million \nequivalent,  including  all  the  investments  in  new  and  improved \nhousing expected to be generated through the catalytic effect of \nthe ADB-financed subloans. The cost estimates assume that the \nULIPHs receiving housing loans through the Project will invest an \namount equal to at least 30% of the value of the total housing \nexpenditure. This beneficiary contribution is conservative and was \nbased on information from commercial banks currently providing \nhousing loans and on results of household surveys and focus \ngroup discussions conducted during project preparation.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $30 million equivalent to \nfinance about 57.9% of the total project cost. ADB will finance the \nentire foreign  exchange  cost  of  $8.5 million  and  $21.5  million \nequivalent (49.7%) of the local currency cost. The balance will be \nborne  by  the  PFIs  and  the  Government  as  well  as  by  the \nbeneficiary  households  from  their  own  resources.  The  PFIs \ncontribution  represents  12.3%  of  the  total  project  cost.  This \ncontribution is regarded as important, as it means the PFIs share \nsome of the risks associated with lending to the target group. \nBeneficiaries will contribute some 28.8% of the project cost. The \ngovernment  contribution  arises  from  incremental  administration \ncosts associated with project management and operation of HFF. \n   \n         ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local   \nSource  Exchange Currency  Total Cost  Percent \n           \nADB  8.5  21.5  30.0  57.9 \nPFIs    6.4  6.4  12.3 \nGovernment    0.5  0.5  1.0 \nBeneficiaries    14.9  14.9  28.8 \nTotal  8.5  43.3  51.8  100.0 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, PFIs = participating financial institutions. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  equivalent  of  SDR22.438  million  ($30.0  million)  will  be \nprovided in various currencies from the Special Funds resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter.  \n   ", "vi   \nAllocation and Relending  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  enter  into  a  financing \nTerms  agreement with SBV with a loan term of 20 years and a grace \nperiod of 5 years. Funds will flow from MOF to HFF established in \nSBV in dong, which will be the currency for all subsequent fund \nflows. The funds for the institutional strengthening and capacity \nbuilding component will be provided by MOF to HFF as a grant. \nEach PFI will sign a housing finance credit (HFC) loan agreement \nwith HFF. HFF will refinance loans from PFIs at a reference rate \ndefined  as  the  weighted  average  of  all  time  deposits  in  the \nbanking system of Viet Nam. HFF will have a fixed management \nfee for handling the housing loan funds, agreed at 1% annually on \nthe outstanding subloans and payable quarterly from PFI subloan \nrepayments to HFF. MOF will bear the foreign exchange risk from \nthe remaining interest payments from PFIs to HFF, after deducting \nof the HFF management fee. PFIs will be free to set the onlend \ninterest rate to the final subborrower. PFIs will be required to \nprovide  from  their  own  resources  capital  equal  to  20%  of  all \nsubloans to borrowers from PCBs and 10% of all subloans to \nborrowers from CFIs.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until June 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee (PSC) will be established to oversee \nArrangements  overall  project  implementation.  The  PSC,  to  be  chaired  by  a \ndeputy governor of SBV, will consist of representatives from the \nMinistry  of  Construction,  MOF,  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and \nMinistry of Justice. The PSC will meet at least quarterly to review \nthe progress of the Project. These arrangements are expected to \nestablish more effective links between government agencies for \ndeveloping  the  housing  finance  system  and  implementing  the \npolicy  and  institutional  reform  action  plan.  A  housing  finance \nconsultative  group  (HFCG)  will  assist  HFF  in  coordinating  the \nProject. Members of the HFCG will initially be HFF and the PFIs.  \n \n   \nExecuting Agency  State Bank of Viet Nam \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  works  to  be financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n   ", "  vii\nConsulting Services  A  total  of  38  person-months  of  international  and  26  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  support  capacity \nbuilding and project implementation. HFF will select and engage \nall consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for \nselecting and engaging domestic consultants. Consultants will \nguide on-the job training to HFF officials involved in implementing \nthe Project. \n   \nProject Benefits and  ULIPHs will improve their houses with the available affordable \nBeneficiaries  long-term funding. It will (i) reduce their vulnerability to natural \ndisasters  by  providing  a  safer  space  to  live,  (ii)  increase  the \nresidential and household stability due to the possession of a \nvaluable  asset,  (iii) provide  an  alternative  source  of  income  in \nemergencies  when  the  house  is  used  as  collateral  to  obtain \nadditional credit, and (iv) reduce rent costs. Improved housing will \ncreate a healthier environment, particularly for women, children, \nand students who spend much of their time in the house. The \nhealth  of  family  members  and  the  education  performance  of \nstudents will in turn improve. Work productivity can also increase \nfor those households that use their own house as their workplace, \nas is common in Viet Nam. \n \nThe project beneficiaries will be ULIPHs willing to take loans from \nPFIs for purchasing, constructing, or improving their houses, and \nwith the capacity to repay subloans by installments. Approximately \n32% of the total project beneficiaries are expected to be poor. The \nProject will benefit more than 137,000 urban low-income and poor \npersons including about 44,000 urban poor. Under the Project, \nPFIs will refinance housing and house upgrading loans to ULIPHs \nwith  monthly  incomes  of  D0.35  millon-3.5  million  ($20-233 \nequivalent). The PCBs will focus on urban low-income households \n(ULIHs)  in  the  D0.75  million-3.5  million  ($50-233  equivalent) \nmonthly household income range who can afford to finance a new \nor  existing  housing  unit  at  a  cost  of  D100  million  ($6,666 \nequivalent) at 70% financing or could upgrade housing for a cost \nup to D20 million ($1,333 equivalent), at commercial interest rates \nand a maturity of up to 20 years. The CFIs will focus on urban \npoor households (UPHs) under the poverty line in the D350,000\u2013\n750,000 ($23-50 equivalent) monthly income range. Affordable \noptions for the poor consist of (i) a building materials loan for self-\nhelp housing, and, (ii) smaller housing improvement for a cost up \nto D15 million ($1,000 equivalent) at commercial interest rates but \nat maturities of 5\u201310 years. \n   ", "viii  \nRisks and Assumptions  Several  risks  associated  with  project  implementation  and \nsustainability  were  identified  and  assessed  during  project \npreparation: (i) the leakage of project subloans to income groups \nabove the target ULIPHs; (ii) PFI unwillingness to lend to ULIPHs \nbecause they are considered risky; (iii) ULIPHs\u2019 unwillingness to \nborrow  from  PFIs;  (iv)  HFF\u2019s  inefficient  management  and \nmonitoring systems; (v) ULIPHs\u2019 nonrepayment of the subloans \nfrom PFIs; (vi) PFIs nonrepayment of the loans from; (vii) slow \nissue  of  land  use  rights  certificates  (LURCs);  and  (viii)  slow \nimplementation of the policy and institutional action plan. Each \nrisk was carefully assessed, taking due account of past lessons \nfrom similar projects in developing countries, and risk mitigation \nmeasures  identified  and  built  into  project  implementation \nprocedures. \n   ", " \nI.   THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Housing Finance Project. \n \nII.   RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The urban population in Viet Nam has increased by about 6 million over the last 10 years at \nan average annual increase of 3.8%. By 2000 the urban population had reached 19 million and \naccounted for 23% of the total population. The Government estimates that the rate of urbanization \nwill increase to 45% of the population, with 46 million people living in urban areas by 2020. With the \ngrowing pressure on urban land due to population growth and rural-urban migration, access to \nhousing has become increasingly problematic in the major urban centers, particularly in Ho Chi Minh \nCity (HCMC), Hanoi, and other large cities. Making land and finance for housing available to the \nurban population, especially the low-income and poor, at affordable rates is a challenge for the \nGovernment.  \n \n3.  In the last decade, the total housing area increased considerably by 739 million square \nmeters (m2) throughout Viet Nam, of which about 185 million m2 is in the urban areas. Upgraded and \nnewly built housing by owners accounted for 75% of total housing, while housing generated by \nconstruction companies accounted for 25%. Per capita living space in the urban areas increased \nfrom 8.2 m2 to 10.4 m2. Notwithstanding this significant progress, housing conditions for a growing \nsegment of the population have deteriorated despite the Government effort to provide low-income \nhouses through housing projects. The housing shortage is serious in urban areas, and low-income \ngroups live in narrow and poor-quality accommodations. Almost 40% of households in urban areas \noccupy a usable housing area of less than 36 m2, including 16% of households that occupy an area \nof less than 24 m2. The majority of the population live in semipermanent houses. Only 26% of urban \nhouseholds have permanent housing types and 20% live in temporary, unstable structures.  \n \n4.  The units constructed by the Government were insufficient to satisfy the huge need and \ndemand for housing in urban areas, particularly for the lower-income groups, given the relatively \nlarge units provided \u2013 which are attractive to middle-income groups \u2013 and inappropriate locations of \nthe units. With the expected rapid growth of the population and increased urbanization and rural-\nurban migration, the imbalance in demand and supply of the housing stock in urban areas will \nincrease. The Ministry of Construction (MOC) targets the construction of some 60 million m2 of \nhousing in urban areas nationwide (24 million m2 to be built through projects and 36 million m2 to be \nbuilt  by  the  people  themselves)  by  2005.  After  2005, the  average  housing  area  per capita  is \nexpected to reach 12 m2, with housing unit averaging 50 m2. MOC has not clearly identified the \nsource for financing house construction on this scale. \n \n5.  The  lack  of  appropriate  financing  mechanisms  has  denied  urban  low-income  and  poor \nhouseholds  (ULIPHs)  access  to  affordable  options  for  housing  construction  or  improvement. \nAppraisal forecasts indicated the potential ULIPH requirements to upgrade and replace current \nhousing to be 65 million m2, involving a cost of D59 trillion ($3.9 billion equivalent) and current latent \nhousing  demand  is  assessed  at  8.1  million  m2,  involving  a  cost  of  D16.3  trillion  ($1.1  billion \nequivalent). The average annual ULIPH new space demand is estimated at 5.6 million m2, involving \na cost of D11.2 trillion ($750 million equivalent) during 2000\u20132010, rising to 6.5 million m2, involving \na cost of D13.0 trillion ($900 million equivalent), during 2010\u20132020. A detailed analysis of low-\nincome housing demand projections is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n ", "2      \n6.  About 80% of housing finance credit (HFC) in Viet Nam comes from the informal sector. That \nincludes moneylenders, friends, relatives, and informal rotating savings and credit associations \n(ROSCAs). Friends and relatives provide loans without charging interest, while moneylenders will \ncharge 5\u201320% monthly. Less than 20% of HFC comes from the formal banking or Government \nsectors. Government finance has declined dramatically since 1986, as the Government shifted \nhousing ownership from the State to individual households. However, the Government is still actively \ninvolved with providing direct housing finance, particularly to the poor and low-income groups. The \nGovernment share of housing finance mobilization is around 10% of the total, but is declining rapidly \ndue to lack of funds. Formal housing finance is still relatively underdeveloped, but is increasing \nrapidly. Commercial retail banks providing housing loans to house owners represent about 10% of \nthe total housing finance market. The more successful commercial banks have experienced rapid \ngrowth in housing loan origination and seen the housing loan share of their loan portfolio increase \nsteadily over the last 3 years. The seven commercial banks most involved in retail housing finance \nloans increased their total housing finance loan portfolio from D1.3 trillion ($95 million equivalent) in \n1998 to D3.0 trillion ($197.7 million equivalent) in 2001, recording an average annual growth rate of \n32%. For some commercial banks, housing finance loans are the fastest growing segment of their \nloan portfolio. \n \n7.  Most banks giving housing loans lack significant access to long-term credit funds for long-\nterm loans, an important prerequisite for developing a strong housing finance market. At present, \nless than 10% of the total funding of these organizations is long-term credit. Consequently, most \nhousing loans originating from these institutions have a relatively short duration \u2013 no longer than 5 \nyears \u2013 and are available only to medium and high-income groups. ULIPHs cannot afford the high \ndebt service required to repay short-term loans. Average housing loan sizes from the banks suggest \nthe loans are made predominantly to medium and higher-income groups.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  The comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy that the Government approved in \nMay 2002 recognizes the multifaceted nature of poverty and poverty reduction. In the strategy, \nurban housing programs and housing finance for the poor and low-income groups are referred to in \nthe context of efforts and programs to reduce urban poverty. Considerable emphasis is placed on \nupgrading urban poor areas, providing land and infrastructure, formulating small-scale credit and \nsavings programs, and mobilizing the community. The ADB country strategy and program for Viet \nNam identifies housing finance for low-income households as one of the priority sectors for ADB \ninterventions in the urban sector.  \n \n9.  It is recognized that the housing sector has the potential to enhance the quality of life and \nreduce poverty and vulnerability. Lack of access to credit has prevented ULIPHs from breaking out \nof poverty by developing the household\u2019s asset base. Lack of medium- and long-term finance has \nbarred ULIPHs from access to affordable credit for their priority housing improvement and new \nhousing. Except beneficiaries of limited Government housing projects, ULIPHs below the mean \nincome level do not have access to any housing credit beyond very short-term finance, often at \nexorbitant terms and conditions. \n \n10.  MOC prepared a broad policy, planning and program document for housing development \nand management in Viet Nam during 2001,1 paying more attention to housing for urban people, \nespecially low-income and poor people. The document formed the basis for two major housing \nsector papers delivered at the third national housing conference in Hanoi during March 20022 that \n                                                \n1  Orientation for Housing Development 2001\u20132010, prepared by the Ministry of Construction, presents the orientation, \nobjectives, and detailed solutions for housing development. \n2  Housing Development and Management Action Plan for 2001\u20132005, Report on Housing Development and Management \nduring 1991\u20132000, and Major Objectives and Measures for the Period 2001\u20132010. ", "  3\noutlined the current housing sector policies, plans, and programs in Viet Nam. Government housing \npolicy initiatives have involved the sale of state housing to residents; access to state land for \nhousing developments; subsidies for the costs of infrastructure for land development; subsidized \nhousing for sale or rent to low-income and priority groups; land, house, and rental price regulation; \nland  and  other  property  tax  exemptions;  and property  management and  maintenance  support. \nGovernment housing policy initiatives on the demand side have been limited to providing subsidized \nhousing credit, at zero or less than market interest rates, to poor and low-income households. \nAccess to such credit has been limited to a small proportion of total urban households in that \ncategory, and is generally associated with resettlement projects in major cities and replacement of \nflood-prone housing in the Mekong Delta and other regions. Supplementary Appendix B describes \nthe housing finance system in Viet Nam. \n \n11.  Although  these  reforms  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  housing  sector,  many \nconstraints still remain, including lack of (i) a national housing finance policy that is integrated with \noverall financial and housing policies; (ii) an institutional and regulatory framework for the housing \nfinance sector; (iii) long-term capital financing for housing; (iv) savings schemes linked to housing \nimprovements and development; (v) a system of transparent, well-justified, and targeted subsidies \nfor  poor  households;  and  (vi)  a  well-functioning  legal  system  for  mortgages  and  valuation  of \nproperties. \n \n12.  The financial system is in poor health. Profitability is low, the capital base is low, and non-\nperforming loans (NPLs) are a major problem. In the last few years, the Government has prepared a \n3-year reform program with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,3 \nunder  the  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  and  poverty  reduction  support  credit.  The \nGovernment\u2019s reform program for the banking sector consists of the following elements: (i) phasing \nout policy and noncommercial directed lending by state owned commercial banks (SOCBs), except \nfor a few cases in the transition where explicit Ministry of Finance (MOF) guarantees are provided; \n(ii) phasing the recapitalization of each SOCB over a 3-year period, conditional on the SOCB\u2019s \nsatisfactory  annual  performance  on  key  actions  and  key  operational  targets  specified  in  their \nindividual restructuring plans; (iii) resolving NPLs of SOCBs through their own asset management \ncompanies  and  loan  workout  units;  (iv)  international  auditors  conducting  annual  independent \ninternational account audits; and (v) raising the share of credit to the private sector. ADB under two \nfinance sector program loans,4 supported the Government efforts to develop alternative channels of \nfinancial  intermediation  through  money/capital  markets,  insurance  and  leasing  subsectors,  and \nfinancial infrastructure to enhance public confidence in the system. Improvements in the nonbanking \nsubsector and capital market will provide long-term funds and investment capital, largely lacking in \nViet Nam, which could fund mortgage refinancing. The Project has taken into consideration all these \ninterventions and is consistent with them. \n \n13.  The housing finance problem in Viet Nam can be defined in several ways: (i) from the point \nof view of a household the problem is the possibility of obtaining a loan at affordable terms; (ii) for \nMOC, the problem is the lack of resources to carry out public housing projects; and (iii) for MOF and \nState  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV)  the  problem  is  to  prevent  financial  instability  and  to  increase \nconfidence in the financial system. The Project will support the establishment of a sustainable \nhousing finance system that will reconcile three partially conflicting objectives (i) affordability to \nhouseholds, (ii) viability of financial institutions, and (iii) resource mobilization to expand the sector.  \n                                                \n3  The International Monetary Fund approved a poverty reduction and growth facility for SDR290 million ($368 million \nequivalent) on 6 April 2001 and the World Bank approved a poverty reduction support credit for $250 million on 4 June \n2001. The areas of reform are comprehensive, covering the private sector, state-owned enterprises, banking, trade, and \npublic expenditure management. \n4  ADB. 1996.

Housing Finance Orientation Policy (Document). Satisfying the requirements for low-\nincome HFC is beyond the reach of Government funding or international external assistance. The \nsolution lies in mobilizing domestic capital finance by facilitating the development of the primary \nhousing finance market and the longer term development of a secondary mortgage market. Housing \nfinance needs to be viewed as a key component of both housing sector and financial sector policies. \nThe Government needs to increase housing policy initiatives to the demand side through a strategy \nthat includes (i) establishing an efficient institutional framework, and improving regulations and \npractices for the housing finance market; (ii) creating new savings products linked to housing loans; \n(iii) developing the primary mortgage market and establishing the basis for a future secondary \nmarket; and (iv) establishing specific measures to support the poor, particularly through urban \nupgrading and own-build options, and transparent targeted subsidies. The Project will support the \nGovernment in developing a housing finance orientation (policy document) that will have those \nelements and promote housing finance as a main element in the national housing and finance \npolicies.  \n \n15.  Institutional Framework for Housing Finance. No particular institution in Viet Nam has the \nmandate to develop the demand side of the housing finance market. The development of an efficient \nhousing mortgage market in Viet Nam requires the establishment of a housing finance facility (HFF) \nthat will be placed initially within SBV and will refinance housing loans from qualified participating \nfinancial institutions (PFI). The HFF would become an independent mortgage refinance agency \n(MRA) and apex institution for housing finance. The Project will provide (i) initial resources to HFF to \nstart its operations on a pilot basis; and  (ii) capacity building and training activities for HFF and \nparticipating  financial  institutions  (PFIs),  with  the  objective  of  developing  the  national  housing \nfinance system. The establishment of HFF will be an opportunity to test the mechanisms for loan \ndisbursement to ULIPHs, and act as a catalyst to facilitate reforms in the housing finance sector. \nHFF will lead to (i) the development of an efficient primary mortgage market accessible to ULIPHs \nby institutionalizing standards, procedures, and good practices among PFIs; and (ii) building up of \nbasic requirements for the emergence of a secondary mortgage market.  \n \n16.  Establishing  HFF  within  an  existing  commercial  bank  was  considered  during  project \npreparation;  however,  international  experience  has  shown  that  this  option  would  prevent  the \ndevelopment of a sustainable housing loan refinancing market because of (i) the conflict of interest \nbetween that bank\u2019s apex wholesale banking function and its retail housing finance function; and \n(ii) the inhibiting influence of competitive retail banks disclosing retail housing finance activities to a \ncompetitor. Once the primary mortgage market has been developed, and HFF has acquired a \nreputation as an efficient, low-risk, and stable facility, HFF would become an independent MRA. \nInitially, however, it is more appropriate to establish HFF inside SBV, as the implicit authority of SBV \nwill ensure sound principles of effective governance and prompt PFIs to accept prudential operating \nstandards. Relocating HFF will be examined in the project midterm review, and ADB and the \nGovernment will agree on a timetable for establishing it as an independent MRA, at the latest, at the \nend of the Project implementation period.  \n \n17.  Long-Term Finance and Expansion of the Housing Finance System. A key constraint to \ndeveloping an effective housing finance market is the absence of long-term credit funds in the Viet \nNam banking system. This disproportionately affects ULIPHs. To expand ULIPH\u2019s access to housing \nloans, the Project will provide a long-term HFC line to HFF to refinance housing loans originated by \nPFIs. Providing medium- and long-term loans for housing will catalyze the development of the \nhousing  finance  market.  Furthermore,  as  capital  markets  and  institutional  investors  such  as \ninsurance companies and pension funds develop in Viet Nam, a sustainable domestic capital flow \ninto HFF/MRA could develop. This will require transforming HFF into a completely independent MRA \nthat would act as a secondary market facility (SMF) with its own capital, efficient management, and \ntransparent procedures, and able to attract long-term capital to the housing sector.  The MRA/SMF \ncould purchase performing housing mortgage loans from PFIs, thus providing new capital to create ", "  5\nfurther housing loans and enlarge the housing finance market in Viet Nam. The Project will support \nthe Government to conceive and design features for mortgage bonds to be issued by a potential \nSMF for long-term institutional investors, and to establish the basis for the long-term of objective of \ndeveloping a secondary mortgage market. \n \n18.  Savings Schemes Linked to Housing Improvement and Development. No particular \nproducts in the banking system link formal savings with mortgage lending for housing. Access to the \nformal housing finance sector can be enhanced through the development of contractual housing-\nsaving schemes, where a ULIPH undertakes to save a given amount over a prescribed period of \ntime and the housing finance institution agrees to provide a housing loan at the end of the saving \nperiod for an amount and term dependent on the accumulated savings amount. Such schemes \nreduce the element of uncertainty for both the ULIPH and the bank. The Project will promote the \nestablishment  of  these  long-term  savings  instruments  linked  to  housing  in  the  participating \ncommercial  banks  (PCBs).  In  the  CFIs,  microcredit  deposit  saving  schemes  would  help  poor \nhouseholds to access the formal housing finance sector through a group savings and lending \nmechanism. Such schemes will be developed and administered under the Project by sustainable \nmicrofinance organizations, generally working through mass organizations such as the Women\u2019s \nUnion  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  This  mechanism  will  involve  microcredit \norganizations lending for home improvement to groups of poor households on the strength of prior \ncollective  group  savings,  with  the groups  being responsible for  dealing  with  individual  savings \ncollection, lending, and loan repayments themselves. \n \n19.  Housing Finance Awareness and Marketing Campaign. ULIPHs have limited knowledge \nof and access to the formal housing finance sector. Survey data collected during project preparation \nindicated that ULIPHs were interested to learn more about housing loans from financial lending \ninstitutions and would consider sourcing housing finance from the formal sector rather than from the \ninformal market sources, particularly moneylenders. To ensure that ULIPHs better understand and \nutilize the project subloans, the Project will enable an awareness and marketing program specifically \ntargeted ULIPHs. \n  \n20.  Database of Housing Finance Demand. There is a large demand for new and improved \nhousing for ULIPHs in resettlement areas, shanty housing improvement projects, industrial estate \nemployee housing projects, as well as government employees. However, commercial banks have \ndifficulties identifying these opportunities for lending to ULIPHs. The Project will help PFIs assess \nthe housing demand of ULIPHs by gathering information on opportunities from particular social \ngroups. Under the Project, HFF will establish a database of ULIPHs. The database will include \nnational registers of resettlement, shanty housing improvement, and industrial estate employee \nhousing projects, as well as government employees requiring housing finance. \n \n21.  Legal Improvements of Mortgage System. The right to grant a mortgage to secure a loan \nusing land use right (LUR) is one of the rights established under the Land Law. There is no legal bar \nto  mortgages  being  used  in  all  cases  where  land  use  rights  certificates  (LURCs)  or  building \nownership and land use certificates (BOLUCs), have been granted or existing historical rights have \nbeen or are entitled to be recognized. However, commercial banks are reluctant to use mortgages \ndue to the uncertainty in calling up property in case of default. While the Land Law and Civil Code \npermit mortgages and the right to sell land in case of loan default, this right is seldom exercised \nbecause the spread and confusion of legislation on mortgages make it difficult for judges to interpret \nand implement the law. To make it easier for both credit institutions and borrowers to understand, \naccept and use mortgages over LUR and houses, the laws relating to mortgages of LURs and \nbuildings attached to land should be revised and consolidated to (i) remove all constraints imposed \nby Government or local authorities on the unrestricted transfer, exchange, or lease of residential \nland, with or without buildings; and (ii) more clearly define the procedures to be followed when \ncalling up a mortgage in default, selling the mortgaged LUR and house, and defining the extent of ", "6      \nthe  court\u2019s  jurisdiction  in  such  cases.  An  interministerial  committee  chaired  by  SBV  will  be \nestablished with senior representatives from MOC, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment \n(MNRE),  and  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  to  prepare  legal  reforms  required  to  ensure  the \nestablishment of a transparent and efficient legal framework for mortgages. The Project will support \nthis process and the preparation of appropriate legislation on mortgages. \n \n22.  Valuation of Housing Mortgage Collateral. Decree 178/1999 requires credit organizations \nto use frame prices when valuing land used as collateral for housing mortgage loans. The land \nframe prices in urban areas are outdated, arbitrary, and inaccurate, as they had been set by \nprovincial people\u2019s committees (PPC) based on the national frame price set by the Government in \n1994. Frame prices for urban land are generally significantly lower than the actual market value. \nThis  decree  requirement  restricts  credit  institutions  from  making  their  own  value  and  risk \nassessments and frequently disadvantages borrowers, as it limits the size of the loan. For ULIPHs \nthis requirement is particularly onerous as it increases the proportion of deposit they are required to \nmeet from savings or additional borrowings. While the credit organization obtains better collateral \ndue to the small loan size relative to the actual land value, the borrower\u2019s access to appropriate loan \nlevels  is  restricted.  When  they  borrow  from  more  than  one  source  to  meet  the  high  deposit \nrequirement, the additional repayment requirements are onerous and in some cases lead to loan \ndefaults. In addition, some ULIPHs are unable to access such credit facility, as they cannot meet the \nhigh deposit and/or repayment requirements. The Project will address this issue in the policy and \ninstitutional action plan by eliminating the use of frame prices by credit organizations valuing land \ncollateral, and providing support for the establishment of a market-based valuation system for \nproperties. \n \n23.  Issue of Land and Building Title Certificates. The slow grant of LURCs and BOLUCs has \nbeen a serious problem in the urban areas in Viet Nam. It is estimated that approximately 18% of the \nurban population have a title certificate for their properties although in particular areas almost half of \nthe population do. Without a BOLUC or LURC, landholders cannot use their land and building assets \nas security under a mortgage. This issue arises from the lack of sufficient numbers of suitably \ntrained  and  experienced  cadastral,  administration,  and  legal  staff  in  the  Department  of  Land \nAdministration (DLA)  or  Department  of  Land Administration  and  Housing  (DLAH)  in  each  city, \nprovince, district, and town, and from the complexity of the mechanism required to obtain the title. As \na result, the land and housing registers maintained by DLAs and DLAHs are incomplete and have \nlimited use as the basis for registering mortgages. MNRE is actively engaged in improving the \nsystem for issuing LURC and BOLUC in cooperation with DLAs and DLAHs of the major cities and \nprovinces. The Government has assured that issuing of titles will continue with the support of \nseveral development partners.  \n \n24.  External Assistance to the Sector. External assistance to housing finance related sectors \nhas been extensive and has advanced the legal and institutional framework for developing the \nhousing  finance  market  in  the  last  10  years.  External  assistance  has  focused  on  (i)  land \nadministration reform, (ii) housing sector, (iii) urban development, and (iv) financial and banking \nsectors. The external assistance to the urban, housing and financial sector is presented in Appendix \n1. \n \n25.  Lessons Learned. Key lessons from past developing country experience with low-income \nhousing loan projects include (i) subsidized interest rates on subloans to ULIPHs invariably leak to \nhigher income groups, regardless of the criteria on income qualification criteria; (ii) supply-side \napproaches involving the provision of sites, services, and housing for ULIPH borrowers generally \nresult in high cost and inappropriate housing unaffordable to the target beneficiaries; (iii) housing \nsubloan origination and repayment management practices frequently lead to leakage of subloans to \nnontarget  beneficiaries  and  high  subborrower  repayment  delinquency  and  loan  default,  unless \nsustainable  capacity  building  technical  assistance  is  provided  and  monitoring  systems  are ", "  7\nestablished; and (iv) secondary mortgage markets are unsustainable unless a primary mortgage \nmarket has developed based on sound land titling and, valuation, and legal provisions for mortgage \nloan recovery. These lessons have been factored into the design of the Project. \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n26.  The Project\u2019s goal is to improve the quality of life for ULIPHs through improved housing. The \nspecific objective is to promote the establishment of a sustainable housing finance market in Viet \nNam accessible to ULIPHs. The Project will provide approximately 27,500 housing finance loans \ndisbursed through qualified PFIs, and will benefit over 137,000 people in the first round of lending.5 \nThe Project will support the establishment of a HFF that would become the apex institution for the \nhousing finance sector. All loans to PFIs will be channeled through HFF, which will become a \nrefinance facility (revolving fund) in charge of disbursement to the PFIs and repayments on a regular \nbasis. The Project will have an institutional strengthening and capacity building program and a policy \nand institutional reform action plan. The Project framework is in Appendix 2. A policy and institutional \naction plan is presented in Appendix 3. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n27.  The Project consists of three parts: (i) mortgage lending to urban low-income households \n(ULIHs);  (ii)  housing  microfinance  to  urban  poor  households  (UPHs);  and  (iii)  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building. \n \n1.  Mortgage Lending to Urban Low-Income Households \n \n28.  Housing mortgage loans to ULIHs through PCBs will be provided through two subprojects: \n(i) mortgage loans for housing purchase (up to D100 million per housing unit cost); and (ii) mortgage \nloans for housing upgrade (up to D20 million per housing project cost). Approximately 4,100 ULIHs \nwill obtain loans to buy or build houses and about 14,600 will obtain loans to upgrade/improve \nexisting houses. \n \n2.  Housing Microfinance to Urban Poor Households \n29.  Through  established  microfinance  community-based  financial  institutions  (CFIs),  housing \nmicrofinance loans to UPHs existing depositors will be provided through two subprojects: (i) loans \nfor small home improvement (up to D15 million per housing project cost); and (ii) loans for own-build \nhousing (up to D15 million housing project materials cost). At least 6,700 UPHs will obtain loans to \nupgrade/improve existing houses, and 2,100 will obtain loans to own-build new houses. \n \n3.  Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building \n30.  The  Project  will  support  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building to  develop  the \nhousing finance system in Viet Nam. The subcomponents follow: (i) support for establishing an HFF \nthat would become the apex institution for the housing finance sector, (ii) a training and capacity \nbuilding  for  HFF  and  PFIs,  (iii)  a  housing  finance  awareness  and  marketing  program,  and \n(iv) establishment of a housing demand database for ULIPHs.  \n \n31.  The Project will include a significant institutional strengthening and capacity building program \nto facilitate the development of a sustainable and effective housing finance market in Viet Nam. All \n                                                \n5  It is possible that the number of beneficiaries over the loan term will increase 2-3 times with housing loan rollovers, \ndepending on the experienced average length of the loan term. ", "8      \nstakeholders will benefit from capacity building activities to develop and enhance management \nprocedures and staff technical capabilities. The Project will (i) train PFIs to attract new customers \n(savers and borrowers) by designing new savings and lending instruments for housing; (ii) train PFIs \nto reinforce their capacity in marketing strategy for housing finance, particularly for ULIPH target \ngroups; (iii) provide advisory services to SBV and PFIs for standardizing mortgage instruments, \nunderwriting,  and  servicing  procedures;  (iv)  assist  SBV  and  the  Government  in  designing  an \nadequate housing-savings scheme that will increase the long-term domestic savings available for \nthe housing sector; (v) assist the financial authorities in developing new instruments based on \nhousing mortgages to be offered in the capital market; (vi) establish the basis for issuing mortgage \nbonds and developing a sustainable secondary mortgage market; (vii) support MNRE, MOC, MOJ, \nand SBV in consolidating and improving the laws, regulations, and practices relating to mortgages \nand valuation of LURs and houses; and (viii) support the Government in preparing a housing finance \norientation (policy document). \n \n32.  Some key characteristics of the Project are that (i) housing loans will be demand-driven, in \ncontrast to the supply-driven approach of sponsored housing development programs involving very \nlimited housing option choices; (ii) the interest rate structure will be at full market rates, without any \nsubsidies,  subject  to  competitive  market  influences;  (iii)  Government  subsidies  through free or \nsubsidized land, infrastructure services, tax rebates, or direct cash advances to UPHs, given through \ntransparent procedures, could complement the Project, but are not required; (iv) housing loans will \nbe available for flexible terms of 5-20 years at levels affordable to ULIPH; and (v) housing finance for \nnew and existing houses and house upgrading, will be provided only for urban areas.  \n \n33.  The four key outputs of the Project are (i) the establishment of HFF to monitor project funds, \nestablish procedures and documentation, and act as a think-tank in developing the housing finance \nsector; (ii) refinancing through HFF to PFIs originating ULIPH housing loans; (iii) establishment of \nlinkages between CFIs and NGOs and people\u2019s committees (PCs) to facilitate small loans to UPH \nfor own-build and house improvement; and (iv) capacity building and institutional strengthening \nthrough  HFF,  resulting  in  effective  project  management  systems  in  PFIs,  a  housing  finance \norientation (policy document), and improvements in legislation on mortgages and valuation. \n \n34.  A wide range of potential PFIs (PCBs and CFIs) have been identified and assessed. Recent \nfinancial statements and operating data, experience in housing finance, and commitment to develop \ntheir housing finance portfolio for low-income households were reviewed. Six PCBs and two CFIs \nwere prequalified as PFIs that could participate in the Project, provided they comply with all the \nconditions established to qualify. The selection of the prequalified PFIs was based on their past \nexperience in housing finance, commitment to participate in the Project and financial indicators. The \nprequalified  PCBs  are  the  Bank  of  Investment  and  Development  of  Viet  Nam,  Industrial  and \nCommercial Bank of Viet Nam, Housing Development Bank of Mekong Delta, Asia Commercial \nBank, Ho Chi Minh City Housing Bank, and Sacombank. The pre-qualified CFIs are the People\u2019s \nCredit Funds network, and Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. Other CFIs could \nbe prequalified after the Government completes the legal framework for microfinance institutions. \nIndependent auditors will prepare a detailed due diligence analysis of the PFIs before they are fully \nqualified and can access project funds. A summary of the key PFI financial performance and \nfinancial forecasts for 10 PCBs and 2 CFIs are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n35.  PFIs must sign a HFC loan agreement with HFF before they can access housing loan \nrefinancing  for  beneficiary  subloans.  The  HFC  loan  agreement  will  outline  (i)  eligible  housing \nsubborrowers;  (ii)  subloan  terms  and  conditions;  (iii)  subloan  management;  and  (iv)  audit, \nsupervision, and reporting requirements. The HFC loan agreement will have these key features \n(i) eligible housing subborrowers have a monthly income in the range of D0.35 million-3.5 million; \n(ii) the maximum subloan for house purchase and home improvement/upgrade is equal to 70% of \nthe value of house or house upgrade cost, requiring a 30% subborrower equity contribution; (iii) the ", "  9\nmaximum price of the house eligible for a subloan is D100 million; (iv) maximum subloan term is 20 \nyears; (v) subborrower provides LURC or, where appropriate, BOLUC as collateral for all subloans \nfrom PCBs, while for housing microfinance from CFI, other forms of collateral will be allowed (e.g., \nindividual or group guarantees); (vi) HFC loans from HFF to PFIs will be for the term of the subloans; \n(vii) HFC loans from the HFF to PFIs will be at a variable interest rate adjusted quarterly and set at \nthe weighted average of all time deposits in the banking system; (viii) interest rates for subloans will \nbe in accordance with the interest rate policy of each PFI; subborrowers can choose a fixed rate \n(prevailing variable rate as defined above plus a premium) for the term of the subloan, or a variable \nrate periodically adjusted; (ix) PCBs will be required to lend 20% of each subloan from their own \nfunds, while CFIs due to their lower equity base will be required to contribute only 10% of each \nsubloan from their own funds; (x) when PFI fails  to repay the principal and/or interest due on a HFC \nloan from HFF, the HFF has the right to call either the outstanding balance of the PFI\u2019s entire HFC \nloan portfolio or the specific HFC loan(s) in default (based on the circumstances of that default and \nthe financial condition of the PFI) and suspend the right of the PFI to obtain further HFC loans; and \n(xi) all risks inherent to subloans by PFIs will be borne by PFIs. \n  \n36.  Loan terms and conditions for loans to PFIs and subloans to individual households under the \nProject have been developed after extensive consultation with potential PCBs and CFIs currently \nengaged in housing finance lending to ULIPHs as well as survey and focus group discussions with \nULIPHs. A summary of survey findings during project preparation is in Appendix 4. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Institutional Development \n \n37.  The establishment of HFF will be the basis for developing institutions and organizing the \nhousing finance sector in Viet Nam. HFF will carry out the following responsibilities: (i) coordinate \ninstitutional support and technical assistance to PFIs; (ii) be the think-tank for conceiving new \nfinancial  instruments  and  developing  the  primary  and  secondary  markets  for  housing  finance; \n(iii) refinance  housing  loans from qualified  PFIs;  and  (iv)  advise  SBV  and  the Government  on \nhousing  finance  strategy  and  policy  matters.  Initially  HFF  would  (i)  establish  assessment  and \nmonitoring procedures for PFIs; (ii) complete the process of qualification of PFI, selected among the \nprequalified PFIs; and (iii) monitor the qualified PFIs and ensure that onlending terms to ULIPHs are \napplied. HFF will be an autonomous unit within SBV. In the medium-term, HFF will ideally become \nan independent MRA that could act as a commercial wholesale facility for refinancing mortgage \nloans. In the long-term, it could become a SMF, with its own capital, able to attract additional long-\nterm funds to the housing sector through the issuance of bonds and mortgage-backed securities. \n \n  2.  Policy Dialogue \n \n38.  Policy dialogue has centered on issues that will facilitate the development of a sustainable \nhousing finance market: (i) a national housing finance orientation (policy document) that integrates \nhousing and finance policy concerns and objectives and establishes the framework for developing a \nsustainable  housing  finance  market  will  be  prepared  and  approved  by  the  Government; \n(ii) consolidating  and  rationalizing  mortgage  legislation  and  preparing  regulations  for  effective \nimplementation;  (iii) releasing organizations from the requirement to use or be influenced by frame \nprices when assessing the value of LURC, and promoting international, market-based valuation \ntechniques and best practices; (iv) continuing the policy reform agenda of the Government in areas \nthat affect housing finance such as the increased issuance of LURCs and BOLUCs, and banking \nsector reform; (v) preparing the basis and assessing options for the long-term expansion of the \nhousing  finance  system  by  developing  contractual  savings  schemes  linked  to  mortgages,  a \nmortgage insurance scheme, and issuance of bonds by a SMF. In many of these areas, policy and \nlegal reform has been an ongoing process and significant positive changes have occurred in recent ", "10      \nyears. In the banking sector, for example, interest rate controls were completely liberalized from 1 \nJune 2002, when the interest rate for lending and deposit rates were deregulated. The project policy \nreforms are in line with the Government\u2019s national policy objective of moving from Government \nsubsidized and control policies to an open market economy.  \n \n  3.  Poverty Intervention \n \n39.  The Project has been classified as a poverty intervention. Approximately 32% of the total \nproject beneficiaries are expected to be poor. Approximately 43,700 urban poor will benefit from the \nProject  directly  through  the  microfinance  component.  Official  estimates  indicate  9%  of  urban \nhouseholds were below the poverty line in 1997/98 Viet Nam Living Standards Survey (VLSS), but \nthis is believed to be an underestimate, as participatory poverty assessments showed that the VLSS \ndid not cover unregistered migrants (whose number is significant in the larger urban areas). The \nproportion  of  urban  households  below  the  poverty  line  is  estimated  to  be  around  15%.  Such \nhouseholds are classified as poor, while households with incomes above the poverty line, but below \nthe average income are classified as low-income for the purpose of the Project. Nationally, two \npoverty lines are in use \u2013 one based on the VLSS analysis, and one used by the Ministry of Labor, \nInvalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA).  For  urban  areas  these  poverty  lines  were  estimated  at \nD873,000 ($58 equivalent) and D750,000 ($50 equivalent) per household per month, while the \naverage household income was D3,550,000 ($237 equivalent) per month. The Project has used the \nMOLISA poverty line to classify the beneficiaries as poor. A poverty reduction and social strategy is \npresented in Appendix 5. \n \n40.  Particular groups of UPHs with stable income could especially benefit from the Project \nincluding (i) resettlement households associated with infrastructure development projects; (ii) canal \nand shanty area households designated for rehabilitation; and (iii) housing projects for selected \ngovernment and major employer worker groups. Resettlement projects have the advantage that land \n(including the grant of LURC) and infrastructure service costs for resettlement housing are generally \nincluded in the project or contributed by the relevant people\u2019s committee (PC) from their own funds. \nAdditionally,  the  compensation  package,  provided  to  affected  households  at  replacement  cost, \nprovides the households with enough funds to pay for a significant part of an improved house unit, if \nthey decide to use the opportunity for a larger or better house. Resettlement projects also have the \nadvantage that they usually have a choice of appropriate housing options for target UPHs. Finally, \nsome resettlement projects have social survey inputs, community consultation, and savings credit \nschemes to prepare households for relocation. In all, resettlement projects offer an opportunity for \nthe Project to provide the vital, and usually lacking, long-term housing credit facility to resettlement \nand rehabilitation projects, without the need to develop an entire housing and infrastructure project. \nAccess  to  housing  loans  for  resettlement  households  would  be  in  addition  to  the  house \ncompensation entitlements to which resettlement-affected people are already eligible. \n \n  4.  Affordability \n \n41.  Affordability analyses were carried out to ensure that project loans will not create an undue \nfinancial burden on the ultimate beneficiaries. Loan repayments for different average loan sizes for \neach component were calculated on a monthly basis and the minimum household income required \nto service the loan amount was estimated for each case. The Project provides a wide array of \nhousing options for ULIPHs wishing to improve their current housing standards, including house \npurchase, own-build housing, and house upgrading. These options provide access to affordable \nhousing credit for all low-income households and even households with a relatively steady income \nstream who are below the poverty line. Households with monthly incomes at the top of the low-\nincome housing range (between D1.8 million-3.5 million per month) can readily afford housing \nfinance to buy a new house or apartment at commercial bank rates (around 10% per annum). \nHouseholds with monthly household incomes below D1.8 million can readily afford to upgrade their ", "  11\nexisting houses or take the own-build option. Households at the bottom of the low-income band (less \nthan D1 million per month) and poor households (above D350,000 per month) will be able to afford \nthe existing house improvement or own-build options. The affordability of different loan products is \npresented in Appendix 6, and a detailed sensitivity analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n  5.   Flow of Funds and Onlending Arrangements \n \n42.  MOF will enter into a financing agreement with SBV, which will establish a HFF-project \nmanagement unit (PMU). Funds will flow from MOF to SBV/HFF in dong, which will be the currency \nof all subsequent fund flows. Qualified PFIs will be required to sign a HFC loan agreement with HFF \nbefore they can access housing loan refinancing for beneficiary subloans. HFF will provide credit \nlines for each HFC of a maximum of $2 million for PCBs and $1 million for CFIs. The maximum total \naccumulated HFC amount for any PFI will be $7 million. PFIs will provide from their own resources \ncapital equal to 20% of all subloans to borrowers from PCBs and 10% of all subloans to borrowers \nfrom CFIs. Subborrowers will contribute some 30% of their housing costs, ensuring they have \nsignificant equity in their housing project.   \n \n43.  MOF and SBV will sign a financing agreement acceptable to ADB providing for (i) the \ntransfer of the funds for the institutional strengthening and capacity building component as a grant; \n(ii) the transfer of the loan from MOF to SBV/HFF for purposes of the Project with a loan term of 20 \nyears and a grace period of 5 years; and (iii) SBV/HFF to pay MOF all interest rate funds on the loan \ndisbursed except 1% for a management fee to be retained by HFF. HFF will use this management \nfee (i) to cover the cost of operating HFF-PMU (including training and capacity building for HFF-PMU \nand PFIs), (ii) to cover the cost of conducting marketing campaigns to ULIPHs to advise them of the \nProject, (iii) to accumulate reserves for working capital when HFF becomes an independent MRA, \nand (iv) to relend to project beneficiaries. The management fee will be calculated at 1% annually on \nthe outstanding subloans, and payable quarterly to HFF from PFI subloan repayments to HFF. MOF \nwill bear the foreign exchange risk from the remaining interest payments from PFIs to HFF, after \ndeducting the HFF management fee. The financial arrangements for the Project are presented in \nAppendix 7. \n \n  6.  Sustainability \n \n44.  The Project will initiate the process to develop a sustainable market-based facility to provide \nhousing finance to ULIPHs. The use of market-based interest rates will lead to sustainability of the \nProject. The establishment of a revolving fund at HFF for refinancing mortgage loans from PFIs will \nensure the sustainability and reuse of the funds. The commitment from PCBs and CFIs to provide \n20% and 10%, respectively of the total loan value will also ensure sustainability. In the medium-term, \nstandardizing the housing loan underwriting procedures, practices, and documentation will facilitate \nthe establishment of appropriate control mechanisms, and in the long-term attract capital to the \nsector for the development of a secondary market. The long-term sustainability of the housing \nfinance sector will be strengthened. \n \n  7.   Project Beneficiaries \n \n45.  The beneficiaries will be ULIPHs, who are willing to take loans from PFIs for purchasing, \nconstructing, or improving their houses, and have the capacity to repay the subloan proceeds by \ninstallments.  The  Project  will  benefit  more  than  137,000  urban  low-income  and  poor  persons \nincluding more than 43,000 urban poor. Under the Project, PFIs will refinance housing and housing \nupgrade loans to ULIPHs with monthly incomes of D0.35 million-3.5 million. The PCBs will primarily \nfocus on ULIHs in the D0.75 million-3.5 million monthly household income range who can afford to \nfinance a new or existing housing unit at a cost of D100 million at 70% financing, or could upgrade \nthe house for a cost up to D20 million, at commercial interest rates and a maturity of up to 20 years. ", "12      \nThe CFIs will focus on UPHs below below the poverty line in the D350,000\u2013750,000 monthly income \nrange. Affordable options for this household segment follow: (i) a building materials loan for own-\nbuild housing; and (ii) smaller home-improvement loans. PFIs will also benefit directly from the \nProject, while construction companies will benefit indirectly. \n \n  8.   Involvement of NGOs and Local Community Groups \n \n46.  The loan delivery mechanism for smaller own-build and house improvement loans will be \nimplemented through CFI-managed credit schemes administered with the assistance of PCs, local \ncommunity groups, and NGOs. These intermediaries will facilitate scaling of UPHs\u2019 individual small \nsavings and lending activities to a larger group scale more attractive to CFIs. NGOs could also \nparticipate by preparing and implementing a social intermediation program that will be part of the \nawareness and marketing program to promote housing finance. The role of the NGOs will be \nparticularly important in implementing the housing microfinance component and will enhance the \nsustainability  of  group-based  long-term  lending  schemes.  The  role  and  contributions  of  these \nintermediary  organizations  and  the  community  group  support  mechanism  are  described  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n \n  9.  Qualifying Criteria for PFIs \n \n47.  The qualifying criteria for PFIs are outlined in Appendix 7. The prequalified PFIs should \ncomply with all the required criteria to become qualified PFIs including: (i) legality standards that \nrequire PFIs to be established, organized, and operate in compliance with regulations of SBV; (ii) \nsolvency standards that assess PFIs in terms of loan portfolio quality and capital adequacy; (iii) \nliquidity standards that assess the capacity of PFIs in converting assets into cash or liquid assets to \ncover short-term liabilities; (iv) profitability and efficiency standards that assess the capacity of PFIs \nin utilizing resources; and (v) standards on management quality of staff that address whether PFIs \nhave staff with managerial and professional skills in accordance with SBV-stipulated regulations.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n48.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $51.8  million  equivalent,  including  all  the \ninvestments in new and improved housing expected to be generated through the catalytic effect of \nthe ADB-financed subloans. The cost estimates assume that the ULIPHs receiving housing loans \nthrough the Project will invest an amount equal to at least 30% of the value of the total housing \nexpenditure.  This  beneficiary  contribution  is  conservative  and  was  based  on  information  from \ncommercial banks currently providing housing loans and on results of household surveys and focus \ngroup discussions conducted during project preparation. Project cost and impact by number of \nbeneficiaries is presented in Appendix 8. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n49.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $30 million equivalent to finance about 57.9% of the \ntotal project cost. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $8.5 million and $21.5 million \nequivalent (49.7%) of the local currency cost. The balance will be borne by the PFIs and the \nGovernment  as  well  as  by  the  beneficiary  households  from  their  own  resources.  The  PFIs \ncontribution represents 12.3% of the total project cost. This contribution is regarded as important, as \nit means the PFIs share some of the risks associated with lending to the target group. Beneficiaries \nwill contribute some 28.8% of the project cost. The government contribution arises from incremental \nadministration costs associated with project management and operation of HFF.

The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will be the Borrower of the ADB loan. The proposed loan \nwill be from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and will have a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years. A service charge of 1% will be levied on the loan during the grace period and \n1.5% during the amortization period.

The provision for financing local currency costs is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local \ncurrency financing policy.6 The Project is expected to have a high demonstration and catalytic value \nin reforming the housing finance sector to make it more efficient and effective in improving access of \nULIPHs to sources of finance for shelter. The relatively high level of local currency support is \njustified, as there is insufficient opportunity for ADB to achieve its objectives by foreign currency \nlending  alone.    The  local  currency  component  of  the  Project  is  high  because  most  housing \nconstruction materials are produced locally, particularly for the upgrading and own-build components \nfor UPHs. \n \n                                                \n6  R1-95: Review for Local Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects. ", "14      \n52.  A project preparatory technical assistance to the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 was provided for preparing the Housing \nFinance Project.7 The portion of the initial grant that exceeds $250,000 equivalent will be charged \nagainst the project loan (part C), and recovered from it. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n53.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be SBV. A project steering committee (PSC) \nwill be established within 3 months of loan effectiveness to oversee overall project implementation. \nThe PSC, to be chaired by a deputy governor of SBV, will comprise representatives from MOC, \nMOF, Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), MNRE, and Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The PSC \nwill meet at least quarterly to review progress of the Project, particularly the institutional, policy, and \nlegal aspects. These arrangements are to establish effective links between government agencies for \ncollaboration in developing the housing finance system and implementing the policy and institutional \nreform action plan. \n \n54.  HFF will be the PMU established within the international credit projects management unit \n(ICPMU) in SBV, to be headed by a project director, who has already been selected. HFF-PMU will \nbe in charge of (i) monitoring the channeling of funds and recovery of the ADB loan; (ii) coordinating \nthe  institutional  support  and  capacity  building  program,  including  recruiting  and  supervising \nconsultants; (iii) developing new financial and savings instruments to attract additional funds to the \nhousing sector; and (iv) advising SBV and the Government on a housing finance strategy and policy \nmatters. HFF-PMU will be responsible for day-to-day management, and monitoring of all project \nactivities, including coordination with SBV departments, government ministries, and agencies, and \nPFIs. HFF-PMU will have a staff of at least 15 professionals, including a project director and a full-\ntime project manager, and supported by international and domestic consultants. A solid financial \nmanagement  system  for  HFF-PMU  including  internal  financial  and  accounting  controls  will  be \nestablished before the first disbursement to refinance the subloans under the Project.  \n \n55.  To facilitate implementation, and ensure the credibility and standardization of the mortgage \nfinancing facility in the marketplace, a Housing Finance Consultative Group (HFCG) will assist in \ncoordinating the Project. Members of the HFCG will initially consist of HFF and the PFIs.  \n \n56.  Project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  as  separate  housing  finance  units  will  also  be \nestablished  in  each  PFI  to  manage  the  loans  provided  under  the  Project.  The  HFF  role  and \nresponsibilities, and organizational structure are described in Appendix 9. A project organization \nchart is presented in Appendix 10. \n   \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n57.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years and is expected to be completed by December \n2007.  To  ensure  timely  implementation  and  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  emphasis  on  the \ndisbursement readiness of approved loans, HFF will prepare a detailed disbursement plan for the \nfirst year of the Project, and thereafter annually, based on disbursement plans submitted by PFIs. \nWithin  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  HFF  will  develop  appropriate  lending,  monitoring,  and \nreporting procedures for PFIs, and finalize HFC loan agreements with individual PFIs. New housing \nloans are expected to come from qualified PFIs within 12 months of loan effectiveness. During this \nperiod, the consultants will be recruited, will provide capacity building services to HFF, and will \n                                                \n7  This technical assistance was financed initially as a grant, but was subject to the reimbursement arrangements set forth \nin the Board papers on Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R51-77, dated 20 May 1977) and Streamlining Technical \nAssistance Operations (Doc. R44-88, dated 21 March 1988). ", "  15\ndesign  and  implement  training  programs  for  HFF  and  PFI  personnel.  Within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness,  the  consultants  will  review  the  operations  of  HFF  and  analyze  the  feasibility  of \ndeveloping a plan and timetable for the evolution of HFF into an independent MRA. The status of \nHFF and the creation of an independent MRA will be evaluated during the midterm project review. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n58.  Goods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. In procuring goods and services to be financed out from the loan \nproceeds,  the  borrowers  will  satisfy  ADB  that  the  procurement  procedures  they  applied  are \nappropriate in the circumstances. Moreover, they will ensure, and certify to ADB if requested, that \nthe goods and services to be financed are purchased at reasonable prices, account being taken of \nrelevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency, and reliability of goods; their suitability; the \navailability of maintenance facilities and spare parts; and, in the case of services, their quality and \nthe competence of the parties rendering them. Equipment items that are locally available and cost \nless  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  through  direct  purchase  in  accordance  with \nprocedures satisfactory to ADB. Indicative contract packaging for equipment and a vehicle for HFF is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n59.  A total of 38 person-months of international and 26 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices will be required for capacity building and project implementation support. HFF will select \nand engage all consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements acceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. A \nconsulting firm will be engaged by HFF to provide all services required using the ADB quality-and-\ncost-based selection method. Individual consultants may be engaged to provide specific services if \napproved by ADB. Consultants will provide on-the-job training to HFF officials implementing the \nProject. Appendix 12 presents the outline terms of reference for consulting services. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n60.  The Borrower will disburse funds under the Project through two imprest accounts (one for \nconsulting services and equipment, and the other for subloans refinancing), to be established at a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB immediately after loan effectiveness. The imprest accounts will \nreceive an initial advance equivalent to the Borrower\u2019s anticipated disbursements to HFF and to \nsubborrowers  over  a  6  month  period.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001), as \namended from time to time. ADB's statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used to \nliquidate  advances  into  the  imprest  accounts or for  reimbursements.  However,  each  individual \npayment reimbursed or liquidated using the SOE procedure will not exceed $100,000 equivalent; \notherwise, HFF needs to submit supporting documents. To monitor the subloan repayments by PFIs \nto HFF, the PFIs and HFF need to attach a copy of the subloan repayment account statement as a \nsupport document for further uses of the ADB loan proceeds. \n \n61.  Each PFI will submit the first 10 subloans to be refinanced by HFC loans individually with all \nrelevant loan appraisal documentation to be reviewed by HFF. Subsequently, HFF will disburse HFC \nloans to PFIs on the basis of lists of subloans (LOS) of not less than D500 million ($33,333 \nequivalent). Initially, the LOS will be accompanied by relevant loan appraisal documentation, and \nHFF will review and approve the documentation for 5 subloans included in the LOS before approving \nthe disbursement of HFC loans. After the submission of the third LOS by any individual PFI, HFF, \nwith the concurrence of ADB, may suspend submission by that PFI of loan appraisal documentation ", "16      \nfor  that  PFI  and  rely  on  monitoring  the  appraisal  documentation  during  the  6  monthly  review \nsessions. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n62.  HFF-PMU  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples, with sufficient details to identify the type and number of subloans financed by the loan \nproceeds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit annually all the accounts, financial statements and \nstatements of expenditures and revenues. Audited project accounts, together with the report of the \nauditor, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the fiscal year. In addition to the \naudited project accounts, HFF-PMU will submit audited annual financial statements throughout the \nlife of the loan. HFF-PMU will also submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the loan closing \ndate, a completion report on loan utilization, subproject implementation, and the performance of \nPFIs  and  subborrowers  with  respect  to  onlending  funds  to  ULIPHs  for  housing  purchase, \nimprovement, and own-build housing. In addition, under the HFC loan agreements between HFF \nand each PFI, the PFIs will be required to maintain full records on the subloans. HFF and ADB may \nreview and audit these records on a random basis. \n \n63.  An  administration  and  reporting  division  to  be  established  within  HFF-PMU  will  be \nresponsible for project supervision, monitoring, and reporting. HFF-PMU, on behalf of MOF and \nSBV, will submit to ADB a quarterly progress report on commitments and disbursements, problems \nencountered during the quarter under review including any material or adverse change in the \nProject\u2019s activities, actions taken or proposed to be taken to remedy the problems, and expected \nprogress during the following quarter. HFF-PMU will keep records of all onlending activities under \nthe  Project,  identifying  the  subborrower  or  intermediary;  the  purpose  and  use  of  loans  to  the \nbeneficiaries; the size, term, and interest rate of the subloans to subborrowers; and the estimated \nnumber and income levels of ULIPH beneficiaries. The PFI will maintain adequate records to show \nthat ADB funds were used to finance 80% of total lending through PCBs, and 90% of total lending \nthrough CFIs. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n64.  The Project includes a project performance monitoring system (PPMS) to be undertaken by \nHFF with the help of consultants. The Government will ensure that a PPMS is implemented to \nmonitor and evaluate the technical performance and social and economic benefits of the Project, \nespecially to the ULIPHs, and to ensure the target beneficiaries realize the anticipated benefits. The \nPPMS will (i) monitor the Project\u2019s implementation performance, dealing mainly with the efficiency \nand  effectiveness  of  the  subloan  lending  arrangements;  (ii)  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  operational \nperformance, mainly in relation to the PFIs performance in meeting their respective lending targets; \nand (iii) evaluate the Government\u2019s performance during and after project implementation. The key \nmonitoring indices, in addition to targets and actions outlined in the project framework and the policy \nand institutional action plan, will be (i) internal efficiency of sublending operations, (ii) satisfaction of \nULIPHs\u2019 demand for housing finance; (iii) level of beneficiary contribution; (iv) sustainability of \nmicrocredit CFIs and associated linkages with supporting mass organizations (Women\u2019s Union, \nWorkers\u2019  Union,  Veterans  Union)  and  NGOs;  and  (v)  socio-economic  impact  on  the  ULIPH \nbeneficiaries. In the first quarterly report for each calendar year, the Government will provide ADB \nwith information produced under the PPMS. \n \n65.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, HFF, assisted by the consultants, will finalize and \nrefine the project performance indicators and establish baseline conditions in consultation with PFIs \nand other stakeholders for the purpose of project monitoring and evaluation. This will include socio-\neconomic  data  to  monitor  and  measure  project  impacts.  SBV  and  HFF  will  refine  the  PPMS \nframework, confirm achievable goals, firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish ", "  17\nsystems and procedures within 6 months of loan effectiveness. Baseline and annual data will be \nreported at regular intervals by HFF, which will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the \ndata through its management information system. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate \nflexibility to adopt remedial action related to project design, schedule, activity, and development \nimpacts.  \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n66.  ADB will conduct reviews every 6 months from the date of loan effectiveness during the first \n2 years. The reviews will assess matters relating to the implementation of the subloan refinancing \ncredit line to PFIs, including percentage of loan proceeds disbursed; the type of subborrowers \n(particularly  household  income  levels)  and  category  of  subprojects  (house  purchase,  house \nupgrade, and own build house); interest rates charged to PFIs and subborrowers; loan repayment \nperformance; and appropriateness of the eligibility criteria for qualified PFIs. The findings of the \nreviews will be taken into account in further implementation of the Project. PFIs will be required to \nprovide subborrower socioeconomic data on income, type of housing activity financed, lending \nterms, and other aspects determined by HFF. In addition to regular reviews to be undertaken during \nthe project implementation period, the Government and ADB will jointly carry out a comprehensive \nmidterm review approximately 2 years and half after loan effectiveness, to monitor progress and \nachievements,  and  particularly  to  agree  with  the  Government  on  a  program  and timetable for \ncreating an independent MRA as the first step in moving HFF along the path to a fully functioning \nSMF. Outline terms of reference for the midterm review mission are in Appendix 13.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n   \n67.  This Project will support the establishment of a sustainable housing finance market in Viet \nNam that would ultimately mobilize substantial capital for housing finance and facilitate the long-term \nestablishment of a strong mortgage-based collateral market to provide housing loans to all sections \nof the population. The Project will directly assist 137,000 urban low-income and poor persons to \nimprove their housing, health standards, and economic well-being by giving them access to long-\nterm housing finance. ULIPH housing financing mechanisms are expected to develop through the \nformal financial sector, leading to a gradual shift in housing finance from the constrained and, \nsometimes  expensive,  informal  finance  sector  to  formal  housing  finance  institutions.  The \nGovernment\u2019s high-level targets for the number of housing units and space upgrade standards may \nprove more reachable as the formal housing finance market develops. A strong housing finance \nmarket will create demand for more appropriate housing \u2013 in terms of size, standards, and quality \u2013 \nwhich will, in turn, lead to more demand-driven housing development activities and the emergence \nof market-driven housing development companies. \n \n68.  A  sustainable  housing  finance  market  will  be  a  source  of  small-  and  medium-sized \ndevelopment finance and will unlock underutilized capital currently tied up in residential property that \nis inaccessible because there is no established instrument for property mortgage as collateral. The \nProject will also have an impact on the construction industry and stimulate the production of local \nconstruction materials. This activity will, in turn, increase employment in the construction sector, one \nof the most labor-intensive industries. Employment could also increase in the banking sector. \n \n69.  The  development  of  the  housing  finance  subsector  will  facilitate  linkages  between  the \nhousing and the finance sectors. This linkage will create a flow of long-term credit funds into the \nsubsector that will allow the creation of outflows of long-term mortgage loans to householders. The \nProject will provide initial long-term credit funds to test long-term mortgage lending mechanisms that \nwill in turn attract additional long-term credit funds into the subsector. The impacts of the housing \nfinance subsector on the housing and finance sectors will foster a strengthened and more market-\ndriven approach to housing creation in both sectors, particularly for ULIPHs. ", "18      \n \n70.  The Project will help mobilize private savings and channel them toward the housing sector. \nThe  limited  public  resources  raised  by  the  Government  could  then  be  used  as  leverage  for \nexpanding private savings. The Project will assist the Vietnamese banking sector in raising long-\nterm resources, implementing sound working methods, and offering adequate savings products and \nlong-term mortgage instruments to their customers. In the medium term, the Project will contribute to \nthe development of the conditions for the creation of efficient housing finance primary and secondary \nmarkets comprising (i) a well- functioning titling and mortgage registration system; (ii) standardized \nmortgages; (iii) proper housing loan and mortgage origination techniques; (iv) proper housing loan \nservicing  techniques;  and  (v) existence  of  a  conduit  (MRA)  that  will  make  housing  mortgages \nattractive to potential investors.  \n \n71.  With the availability of affordable long-term funding, ULIPHs will (i) reduce their vulnerability \nto natural disasters by having a safer space to live in, (ii) increase the residential and household \nstability due to the possession of a valuable asset, (iii) have an alternative source of income in \nemergencies by using the house as collateral to obtain additional credit, and (iv) reduce their rent \ncosts. Improved housing will create a healthier environment, particularly for women, children, and \nstudents who spend much of their time in the house. The health of family members and the \neducation performance of students could improve. Work productivity can also increase for people \nthat use their own house as the work place, as is common in Viet Nam. \n \n72.  Risks. Several risks associated with project implementation and sustainability were identified \nand assessed during project preparation. They include the following: (i) project subloans may go to \nhouseholds in income groups above the target ULIPHs; (ii) PFIs are unwilling to lend to ULIPHs \nbecause the latter are considered credit risky; (iii) ULIPHs do not want to borrow from PFIs; (iv) HFF \ndoes not establish efficient management and monitoring systems; (v) ULIPHs do not repay the \nsubloans to PFIs; (vi) PFIs do not repay the loans to HFF; (vii) the issuance of LURCs is slow; and \n(viii) implementation of the policy and institutional action plan is slow. Each risk was carefully \nassessed, taking due account of lessons learned from similar projects in developing countries. Risk \nmitigation  measures  were  identified  and  built  into  the  project  implementation  procedures.  The \nProject will not trigger ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples since it will \nfocus on mortgage lending to individual ULIPH and strengthening and capacity building for housing \nfinance in urban areas. \n \n73.  Risk Mitigation. A number of mechanisms will be incorporated in the Project to ensure that \nsubloans are initiated by PFIs in accordance with the proposed project components, and reach the \ntarget ULIPHs. (i) Household income eligibility criteria for subloan borrowers are incorporated in the \nHFC loan agreements between HFF and PFIs. As household incomes of ULIPHs are difficult to \nassess and validate, this criterion is supplemented by limiting the maximum subloan size and the \ntotal cost of the house to individual ULIPH borrowers. These measures will make it very unlikely that \nsuch subloans will attract higher-income borrowers. (ii) Subloan interest rates will be at financial \nmarket interest rates without any subsidy. This criterion will ensure that higher income borrowers \ngain no financial advantage, even if they try to finance a small part of their housing finance needs \nfrom project subloans. (iii) The housing finance awareness and marketing campaign will explain the \nadvantages of mortgage lending and clarify procedures so as to reduce ULIPHs\u2019 reluctance to \nborrow and to manage risks. (iv) The potential establishment of a Government-backed mortgage \nguarantee fund or a mortgage insurance scheme will correct commercial banks\u2019 perception of \nULIPHs as risks. (v) The development of housing deposit-loan products will assist PFIs to assess \nmore objectively the credit value of ULIPH customers and will reduce the risk of lending to them. \n(vi) The establishment of an effective management information system by HFF will mitigate risks \nassociated with nonpayment of subloans by ULIPH borrowers and repayment of the HFC loans by \nPFIs. The HFC loans and ULIPH subloans will be monitored monthly and recovery procedures \noutlined in the HFC loan agreement between HFF and PFIs. Consultants will be recruited to assist in ", "  19\nestablishing the system. PFIs will bear the credit risks of ULIPH subloans and will partially contribute \nwith their own funds. (vii) Risks associated with any slowing of policy and institutional reforms will be \nmonitored through the activities of the PSC, regular EA reports required by the Project and project \nreview missions. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n74.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SBV will be requested to give \nthe following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will undertake the actions described in the policy and institutional \naction plan (Appendix 3) within the agreed upon time frame, and will advise ADB of \nits progress through the quarterly reports. Lack of sufficient progress in complying \nwith the plan in a timely manner, in the opinion of ADB, will lead to suspension of \ndisbursement of the funds.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that the qualified PFIs will comply with the eligibility \ncriteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB, including the prudential norms \nissued by SBV. The Government will ensure that no ADB loan proceeds will be re-lent \nto a PFI until (a) the opinion of an independent auditor acceptable to ADB has been \nissued, to the effect that such PFI is in proper financial condition, and (b) the PFI \nestablishes a housing finance PIU and separate accounts for Project-related housing \nlending, and formulates loan underwriting, services, and field audit procedures to \nensure that subloans are made only to ULIPHs. \n \n(iii)  The Government will cause the PFIs to ensure that (a) subloans are made available \nonly to eligible subborrowers, including those who are not in default, individually or \ncollectively, on any prior loan; and (b) the subloans will be used only for house \npurchase, upgrading, or own-build housing. \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that quarterly subloan capital repayments to HFF from \nPFIs, net of ADB loan repayments, are re-lent through HFF to the beneficiary income \ngroup specified in the Project. \n \n(v)  Each PFI will observe subloan financing criteria that include maximum ADB financing \nof 80% of the subloans provided by PCBs for ULIHs and 90% of the subloans \nprovided by CFIs for UPHs. \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that subloans will not entail any involuntary resettlement \narising from land acquisition or changes in land use. \n \n(vii)  The relocation of HFF will be examined in the midterm review, and ADB and the \nGovernment will agree on a timetable to establish it as a separate independent MRA, \nat the latest, at the end of the project implementation period, except otherwise agreed \nby ADB. ", "20      \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n75.  The following actions will be required prior to loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  A HFF-PMU will be specifically established within SBV to ensure the implementation \nof the Housing Finance Project and promote the development of the housing finance \nsector in Viet Nam. HFF-PMU will have at least 15 qualified professional staff and \nadditional  supporting  staff,  including  a  project  director  and  a  full-time  project \nmanager. SBV will have issued a Decision of the SBV governor to empower the \nICPMU under the Regulation on the Organization and Operation of the ICPMU, to \nestablish and undertake the responsibilities of HFF, and for HFF to maintain separate \nProject  accounts  for  loan  disbursements,  payment  of  interest  and  repayment  of \nprincipal to MOF and to hold the HFF fee. \n \n(ii)  MOF and SBV will sign a financing agreement, in form and substance acceptable to \nADB, providing for the transfer of the loan from MOF to SBV/HFF for purposes of the \nProject. \n \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n76.  No  disbursement  will  be  permitted  from  the  loan  (except  for  consulting  services  and \nequipment for HFF-PMU) unless the following conditions are satisfied: \n \n(i)  HFF-PMU will have established a financial management system acceptable to ADB, \nincluding internal financial and accounting controls. \n \n(ii)  HFF-PMU will have prepared draft HFC agreements between HFF and PFIs, with \nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB. \n \n \nVI.   RECOMMENDATION \n \n77.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing \nRights 22,438,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Housing Finance Project from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n27 November 2002 ", "Appendix 1  21 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE HOUSING, URBAN, AND FINANCE SECTORS \n \n1.  External assistance to housing finance-related sectors has been extensive and has \ncreated the legal and institutional framework for the development of the housing finance market \nin the last 10 years. External assistance has focused on four areas: (i) land administration \nreform, (ii) housing sector, (iii) urban development, and (iv) financial and banking sector.  \n \n2.  In land administration reform, the Australian Agency for International Development has \nbeen assisting the Government in legal reform in the housing sector. The Swedish International \nDevelopment Assistance (Sida) has been assisting General Department of Land Administration \n(GDLA) through the Viet Nam-Sweden Cooperation Program on Land Administration Reform \n(CPLAR). The first phase of CPLAR, which started in 1997 and was completed in 2001, focused \non land registration, cadastral mapping, land-use planning, land-use mapping, land valuation, \nand land information systems. It has implemented training activities in those areas in nine \nprovinces. Sida is currently discussing the second phase of the project with the Government. \nNew  Zealand  Asian  Development  Aid  Facility  has  been  assisting GDLA  in  assessing  and \nrecommending improvements to the Land Law and its administration and developing a pilot land \nand property valuation system with greater emphasis on rural areas. \n \n3.  The World Bank funded a project for implementation of land policies during 1998-1999 \nthat focused on (i) registration procedures and implementation of a simple land policy reflected \nin a stable land law, (ii) implementation of a unified registry of real estate property transactions, \nand (iii) creation of an effective mortgage system. The World Bank is currently considering a \ncadastral mapping systems project component for the cities participating in its future Viet Nam \nUrban Upgrading Project (VUUP) under preparation. This project component would support the \nproject cities (Ho Chi Minh City, Haiphong, Can Tho and Nam Dinh). Such inteventions will be \ninstrumental in accelerating the grant of land use right (LUR) and the issuance of land use rights \ncertificates (LURC) and building ownership and land use certificates, as one of the major \nimpediments to the grant of LUR is the large amount of work needed for a detailed survey of \neach parcel of land. \n \n4.  In the housing sector, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation produced a report \non the evolution of and recommendations for the sector in 1999, including a component on \nhousing finance. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has been assisting the Ministry of \nConstruction on housing policies since 1999 providing a seconded full-time housing policy \nspecialist. The World Bank, under a 2001 Cities Alliance project to enhance access of the urban \npoor and vulnerable groups in Viet Nam to basic infrastructure and housing, included such tasks \nin the housing sector as: (i) assessing constraints faced by the urban poor in housing and \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  reviewing  recent  and  ongoing  urban  upgrading  programs;  (iii) developing \nnational strategy on scaling up programs and providing better housing and services for the \nurban poor; and (iv) developing a detailed action plan for a selected city. The proposed VUUP \nunder preparation has two proposed housing sector components: (i) microfinance capital for \nlow-income housing upgrading credits \u2013 a credit line will be set up in each project city to provide \nmedium-term financing to house upgrading in the project areas; and (ii) appropriate resettlement \nhousing for low-income households and/or serviced sites for self-build housing. Financing will \nalso be made available to prepare sites serviced with basic infrastructure so that relocated \nhouseholds can build housing themselves. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, and most bilateral sources are extensively involved in \nurban infrastructure projects, and many of which have resettlement housing components that \nmay provide prospective home loan borrowers for the Project. \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \n5.  External assistance in the banking and financial sector has been predominantly through \nADB, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. Assistance is focused on creating a sound \nbanking system in Viet Nam. The key elements of the banking sector reform program: (i) State \nBank of Viet Nam (SBV) is leading a D30 trillion ($2 billion equivalent) reform and restructuring \nprogram over the next 5 years; (ii) D7 trillion ($0.47 million equivalent) will be spent on settling \nbad debts of state-owned enterprises (SOENs); (iii) SBV is to strengthen the risk protection fund \nand set up an asset management company to buy bad bank loans; first step is for the banks to \nestablish their own asset management units; (iv) the above capital is to come from commercial \nbanks, nonconvertible Government bonds, public bills, and foreign aid; (v) the average capital of \ncommercial banks will be increased from the current $70 million to $200 million in a 3-year \nprogram involving independent auditing of the banks; (vi) SBV was to shut down or merge the \nless  viable  of  48  mainly  small  joint-stock  banks;  (vii) the  Government  will  halt  politically \nmotivated lending to SOENs, except when a Government guarantee is provided in special \ncases; and (viii) the restructure or closure of 5,500 inefficient SOENs that consume more than \nhalf of all available bank credit but employ only 10% of the workforce.

A considerable volume of information on the housing and housing finance needs of \nurban low income and poor households (ULIPHs) was collected during the Project from surveys \nand secondary sources. Household surveys were conducted in Hanoi and eight other urban \ncenters,  covering  1,000  households  with  5,100  household  members.  Twelve  focus  group \ndiscussion sessions were conducted in five urban centers with participants including  (i) low-\nincome housing experts of Government agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \nmass organizations (e.g., Youth, Women\u2019s and Trade Unions); (ii) project management unit \n(PMU) members of savings-credit group projects; (iii)  ULIPHs with member experience of \nmicrocredit deposit savings and lending groups; (iv) ULIPHs who have previously participated in \nresettlement or slum upgrading schemes (e.g., Binh Trung Dong Ward Ho Chin Minh City \n(HCMC) residents, HCMC canal relocation schemes, Hanoi housing redevelopment schemes); \n(v) ULIPHs currently involved with resettlement or slum upgrading processes, but not yet \nrelocated; and (vi) ULIPH people with a stable income base. The main secondary information \nsources were official statistics from the Population Census and Vietnam Living Standard Survey \n(VLSS). \n \nB.  Survey Objectives \n \n2.  The primary objective of the surveys was to profile ULIPHs to establish their willingness \nto invest in housing and affordability of the investment. The surveys involved (i) assessing \nULIPH socioeconomic characteristics, their housing needs, and their potential demand for \nhousing finance; (ii) developing an understanding of ULIPH capacity to absorb housing finance; \n(iii)  identifying  existing  sources  and  constraints  related  to  housing  finance  for  ULIPHs; \n(iv) investigating forms of collateral for ULIPH housing finance subloans; (v) assessing technical \nand  capacity-building  support  required  for  loan-financed  housing  improvements;  and \n(vi) assessing the impact of improved housing on poverty reduction and the empowerment of \nwomen. \n \n3.  The objectives of the focused group discussions, based on experiences of savings and \ncredit group projects and resettlement projects, aimed to obtain the following information: \n(i) saving capacity and housing expenditure of  ULIPHs; (ii) affordability of housing to ULIPHs; \n(iii) commercial bank accessibility for  ULIPH housing finance; (iv) advantage, disadvantage, \ndemand, and needs of ULIPHs related to housing issues; and (v) experiences of savings and \ncredit group activities. \n \nC.  Key Survey Findings \n \n1.  Household Demographics \n \n4.  The  ULIPHs  showed  demographic  characteristics  similar  to  those  reported  in  the \nPopulation Census and VLSS statistics. The average household size was 5.4 persons, with \n66% of households having 5 or more resident members. Some 60% of ULIPH residents had \nfinished high school and an additional 10% had progressed to graduate or postgraduate level. \nMore  than  one  half  of  ULIPHs  were  income  earners  slightly.  More  than  30%  were  in \nnonprofessional jobs and just less than 25% were professionals. Some 20% were retired and \none-fourth were less than 15 years of age. Some 90% of ULIPHs had resided in their existing \nhousing for more than 10 years. The monthly household income profile was concentrated in the ", "Appendix 4  29 \nD1 million-2 million band, accounting for almost 70% of ULIPHs surveyed. Only 2% had monthly \nhousehold incomes above D3.5 million and 20% had incomes below D1 million per month. \nExpenditure levels tended to be lower, indicating that savings does occur, with some 35% of \nULIPHs surveyed reporting monthly expenditures below D1 million. \n \n2.  Existing Housing Characteristics \n \n5.  Housing occupied by the surveyed ULIPHs was significantly concentrated in the small \nsize range, with some 65% occupying housing units with less than 50 square meters (m2) of \nliving space, mostly less than 35 m2 (45% of ULIPHs interviewed). Most housing had little land \narea outside the house; slightly less than 70% of ULIPHs had a land area less than 50 m2. The \nresults were validated by other surveys. A survey of ULIPHs in the Tan Hoa-Lo Gom area of Ho \nChi Min City (2000) revealed that some 60% of ULIPHs were living in housing less than 35 m2. \nMore than 90% of ULIPHs housing units were older than 10 years, predominantly of semi \npermanent materials, and without LURC. While access to social services (kindergarten, school, \nhealth care, market, shops) was regarded as satisfactory, some 60% of ULIPHs surveyed \nregarded the public water supply and drainage and wastewater system services as poor.  \n \n3.  Housing Demand and Preferences \n \n6.  There is a significant demand for new housing, with some 75% of ULIPHs requiring new \nhousing or housing improvements, predominantly in attached houses (60% of ULIPHs), and \ngenerally in the same area (40% of ULIPHs) or district of city (additional 20% of ULIPHs). The \nlower down the income scale, the higher is the preference for home improvements rather than \nnew house purchase. Around 80% of ULIPHs indicated their existing house structures were bad \nand 75% had undertaken some form of dwelling improvement in the past (40% once, 20% \ntwice, and 15% more than twice). The majority of ULIPHs (55%) preferred housing units in the \nsize range 30-50 m2, while 35% preferred units larger than 50 m2. \n \n7.  Focus group ULIPHs indicated a past experience and a strong interest to invest in \nhousing as an asset to generate income through at-home work and to use capital gains from \nlandholdings purchased and their existing small houses to purchase and/or build larger and \nimproved housing. There was clear evidence that, through the informal real estate and housing \nfinance market segments, some ULIPHs are actively engaged in buying and selling land and \ntheir houses to upgrade to improved housing. If ULIPHs had improved access to long-term \nhousing finance loans, they would use this source to accelerate their current slow progress with \nimproving their housing circumstances. The resultant spin-off would be that the existing housing \nstock would be released to ULIPHs lower down the chain, inducing the generally lower income \nlevel ULIPHs to purchase their own house or upgrade from housing of poorer condition. \n \n4.  Housing Finance Sources and Accessibility \n \n8.  Sources for housing finance come from savings (30-60%), loans without interest from \nrelatives and friends, and a maximum one third from bank loans. Some households spend more \nmoney than their capacity and estimated budget for a new house and need to borrow from \nmoneylenders (D2 million-5 million) at high interest rates (5-20% per month). Where there are \nno savings-credit groups, ULIPHs in the lower income levels find it difficult to save and repay (at \nlevel of D2 million-3 million per year). Few ULIPHs have experience with commercial banks and \nthink they are difficult to access for both deposit and borrowing purposes. The reasons for not \nusing  bank  loans  were  nonavailability  of  collateral  (55%  of  ULIPHs)  and  the  complicated \nprocedures (30% of ULIPHs). There was significant interest from ULIPHs in obtaining more ", "30  Appendix 4 \n \ninformation on bank lending for housing and a strong desire for public information programs \noutlining housing finance loan opportunities and procedures. \n \n5.  Willingness to Borrow Using Housing Loans \n \n9.  Some one third of ULIPHs interviewed expressed a current interest to access bank \nhousing finance for loans in the range D5 million-200 million, with an average loan level at D47 \nmillion, for a new house and D20 million for house upgrading. Because repayment capacity is \nlimited, most ULIPHs do house upgrading step by step. Many ULIPHs prefer 3-5 year loan \nterms for housing upgrading and 5-10 years for new houses. Poor households prefer a loan size \nof D5 million-10 million for step-by-step house upgrading. ULIPHs supported a one-third deposit \ncondition for a housing finance loan.  \n \n6.  Capacity to Repay Loans \n \n10.  ULIPHs prefer to repay housing loans as soon as they can, as there is a strong culturally \ningrained obligation to repay debt in Viet Nam. This preference has been influenced by the lack \nof long-term loan availability for housing finance. Repayments of 30% of income are generally \nconsidered to leave sufficient income for food and other necessities, and with the current short-\nterm financing for housing in Viet Nam, much higher percentages ?u p to 50% of income ?a re \ncommon. Currently, typical loan sizes of D40 million-50 million are serviced by ULIPHs, and \nthose with a salary or stable income can easily repay a D15 million loan over 3 years, but it is \nless easy for those who have a small business without stable income. Preferred monthly \nrepayment levels indicated by ULIPHs interviewed were an average level up to D1.2 million in \nsome areas and an overall average of D780,000. \n \n7.  Gender Issues \n \n11.  Traditionally, a husband is the household head, though, some 32% of all households in \nViet Nam have a female head. Women are the ones who manage household expenditure and \nsavings, while men earn money and are responsible for housing. Women play the role of saving \nand repaying, but have not been able to obtain loans. Most ULIPHs thought it is better if loans \nare issued in both husband and wife's names to prevent the husband from improperly using \nand, sometimes, transferring land use rights certificates (LURCs) without the consent of the wife \nor other members of the household. At present, women are more involved in savings-credit \ngroups and improve their knowledge and skills. Women have lower levels of education and \ncommunication  skill,  so  they  feel  inadequate  in  discussing  business  matters  with  banks, \nespecially if their names do not appear on the LURC or building ownership and land use \ncertificate (BOLUC). Savings-credit programs supported by the Women's Union (WU) and \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have strongly encouraged the role of women in loan \nactivities. Such programs have helped residents, especially women, to improve their knowledge \nand skills in savings and repayment management. ", "                      Appendix 5  31 \nPOVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.   Linkages to Country Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy recognizes the multifaceted \nnature of poverty and poverty reduction. Urban housing programs and housing finance for the poor \nand low-income groups are referred to in the context of efforts and programs to reduce urban \npoverty. Emphasis is on (i) upgrading urban poor areas, (ii) providing land and infrastructure, \n(iii) formulating small-scale credit and savings programs; and (iv) mobilizing communities. \n \n2.  It is recognized that the housing sector has the potential to bring the efforts together in \nurban upgrading programs, building on individual household efforts. The Government's role is an \nenabling one ? f acilitating the provision of land and land tenure, neighborhood infrastructure and \naccess to credit. Lack of credit ? d irectly income -generating activities, as well as credit to develop \nthe household's asset base ? h as prevented  urban low income and poor households (ULIPHs) \nfrom breaking out of property. Lack of finance at terms of more than 1-2 years has hindered \nULIPHs from undertaking priority housing improvement and affordable new housing. Except for \nbeneficiaries of limited Government housing projects, ULIPHs do not have access to any housing \ncredit beyond very short-term finance, often at exorbitant terms and conditions. \n \n3.  Housing finance currently exists in rudimentary form, with some banks and microcredit \ninstitutions providing a limited volume of short-term housing loans. The Project will support the \ndevelopment of the housing finance subsector by providing participating financial institutions (PFIs) \nhousing subloans to refinance house and housing upgrade to ULIPHs with monthly incomes of \nD0.3 million-3.5 million. ULIPHs in this range comprise about 50% of all urban households in Viet \nNam. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \u2013 Proposed Classification: Poverty Reduction \n \n4.  In 1999, Viet Nam's urban population was estimated at 17.9 million (4.0 million households \nand 23.5% of national population). Urban population growth is expected to be 3.0% per year for the \nperiod 2000-2010. Viet Nam living standard survey (VLSS) indicate 9% of urban households were \nbelow the poverty line in 1997/98, but the figure is believed to be an underestimate, as the survey \ndid not cover unregistered migrants (of which there are significant numbers in the larger urban \nareas), as indicated by participatory poverty assessments carried out. By these assessments, the \nproportion of urban households below the poverty line is around 15%. Such households are \nclassified as poor, while households with incomes above the poverty line, but below the average \nincome, are classified as low-income for the purpose of this project. Nationally, there are two \npoverty lines in use, one based on the above VLSS analysis, and one used by Ministry of Labor, \nInvalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA). For urban areas, these poverty lines were estimated at \nD873,000 and D750,000 per household per month in early 2002, while the average household \nincome was estimated at D3,500,000 per month, for the purpose of the Project. \n \n5.  Government's achievements in reducing poverty are very significant, with poverty levels in \nboth urban and rural areas now  reduced significantly (according to VLSS data, from 25% in \n1992/93 to 9% in 1997/98 for urban areas, and from 66% to 45% in rural areas in the same years \n?B ut as noted above, urban poverty incidence is underestimated). Still, some elements of poverty \nreduction have lagged, while some dimensions of poverty have become more acute. With the \ncontinuing significant difference in population growth between urban and rural areas (national \nannual average population growth rate projected at 1.1% per year for 2000-2001 and at 3.0-3.2% \nin urban areas), poverty is becoming urbanized along with these demographic changes. ", " 32  Appendix 5   \n6.  Poverty related to housing in urban areas has not been reduced; urban poor households \n(UPHs) still face significant bottlenecks in access to (i) land use rights (LURs), (ii) community-level \ninfrastructure, and (iii) medium- to long-term finance for shelter. Insufficiently serviced urban land \nfor buildings has come on the market but issuing the  land use rights certificates (LURCs) and \nbuilding ownership and land use certificates (BOLUCs) has lagged behind the demand spurred by \nurban population growth. \n \n7.  With growing pressure on urban land and the absence of comprehensible and enforceable \nplanning regulations, access to minimum infrastructure has increasingly become problematic in the \nmajor  urban  centers,  particularly  in  HCMC  and  Hanoi.  The  lack  of  appropriate  financing \nmechanisms has denied UPHs access to affordable housing. Housing conditions for a growing \nsegment of the population have deteriorated despite Government efforts to provide low-income \nhousing through the Ministry of Construction (MOC) project-based housing development model. \nThe units produced by this model were insufficient to make a difference, particularly since the \nrelatively large unit sizes make them attractive to both middle-income groups and ULIPHs, and \nthere are problems with inappropriate locations of the units. Private sector developer housing is \nlimited and out of reach for ULIPHs. Thus, the overwhelming majority of ULIPHs continue to rely on \ntheir own efforts to provide shelter. \n \n8.  A  critical  challenge  is  to  overcome  the  indicated  bottlenecks  in  access  to  land,  local \ninfrastructure, and services,1 and to appropriate housing finance loans. The Project will support the \ninitial stages of development of a targeted housing finance system, and will provide  housing \nfinance credit (HFC) loans to PFIs to refinance house and house upgrading subloans to ULIPHs \nwith monthly incomes of D0.3 million-3.5 million. A variety of housing options are affordable to \nhouseholds in this income range, as demonstrated by the affordability analysis in Appendix 6. \n \n9.  The participating commercial banks (PCBs) will focus primarily on ULIHs in the D0.75 \nmillion-D3.5 million monthly household income range who can afford to finance a new or existing \nhousing unit at a cost up to D190 million at 70% financing, or could upgrade their house for a cost \nup to D20 million, at commercial interest rates and maturity of up to 20 years. The microfinance \ncommunity-based financial institutions (CFIs) will focus on UPHs below the poverty line in the \nD300,000-D750,000 monthly income range. Affordable options for this household segment are (i) a \nbuilding materials loan up to D15 million subproject cost; and (ii) smaller home-improvement loans \nup to D15 million subproject cost, at commercial interest rates and terms of 5-10 years. The Project \nwill  benefit  approximately  137,000  urban  low-income  and  poor  people.  Around  32%  of  the \nbeneficiaries (43,700) will be below the poverty line. \n \n10.  The Project will focus on the major urban areas. It is likely that the impact of the Project will \nbe felt particularly in HCMC and Hanoi where (i) urban poverty is highly significant, (ii) local \nauthorities have already started to address land and infrastructure issues, and (iii) which have the \nonly exclusively urban-based and well-developed CFIs. \n \n11.  For the UPH, reliance will be placed on group-supported or group-based savings and loans \nstrategies, in line with the current practice of already active CFIs. A major support mechanism to \nensure adequate participation of eligible groups (and particularly women heads of households) is \nthe involvement of the Women's Union (WU) in forming solidarity groups. Households will generally \n                                                 \n1  Local authorities in urban centers have become increasingly aware of such issues, and recently implemented slum \nupgrading and began reviewing sites-and-service resettlement schemes. Planning standards are being modified \n(downward) to make them more responsive to target group requirements and affordable, and to make them less \nattractive to competing demand from more affluent social groups. ", "                      Appendix 5  33 \nborrow individually, but in solidarity groups of five borrowers, supported by the WU in the ward \nconcerned (through a center leader supporting on average eight such groups in the ward). The WU \ncenter leader facilitates initial loan preparation and documentation, and acts as a collection agent \nfor CFI branches. Other mass organizations, such as the Veterans Union, Youth Union, and Labor \nUnion, as well as selected nongovernment organizations, will play similar roles. \n \n12.  Where appropriate, this group-supported approach will be supplemented by group-based \nlending, in which the CFI will lend to groups, with the groups themselves being responsible for \ndealing with individual savings collection, lending, and loan repayments. In many cases, this \nmeans intermediation to existing informal  rotating savings and credit associations, which have \nlimited experience in the major urban centers. \n \n13.  Such group-based mechanisms will be reinforced by the introduction of a new, largely \ngroup-based savings for housing loan programs by the CFIs, in which 2-3 years prior savings will \nbe required to provide guaranteed access to a housing loan of at least four times the built-up \nsavings. Credit terms will be market based, with medium- to long-term repayment periods. \n \n14.  Within the housing finance facility, a unit for the microfinance component for UPH through \nCFIs will be established and will be supported by consultants with experience in microfinance. \n \n \nTable A5.1: Social Issues \n \nSubject  Significant Degree  Strategy to Address Issues  Output Prepared \n       \nResettlement  None    None \n       \nGender  Not significant  Limited gender action plan  Yes, limited \n       \nAffordability  Long-term financing will  Appropriate housing options are  No \nmake access to finance  affordable; different housing \nmore affordable to urban  finance products will be offered \nlow income and poor  under the project, including \nhouseholds (ULIPHs),  affordable options for UPHs \nincluding urban poor  such as house upgrading and \nhouseholds (UPHs).  own-build housing. \n       \nLabor  None    No \n       \nIndigenous People  None    No \n       \nOther Risks/Vulnerabilities  ULIPH targeting and UPH  Safeguarding UPH's access  Yes, lending criteria; \ntargeting in particular  through end-use and  project performance \ninvestment/loan size eligibility  monitoring system  \ncriteria to be used by  and capacity-building \nparticipating financial institutions  measures in PFIs \n(PFIs) and particularly in \ncommunity finance institutions \n       \n \n ", " 34  Appendix 5   \nTable A5.2: Outline Gender Action Plan \n \n   \nIssues  Proposed Action Steps \n \n   \n1.

The loan will be from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. A service charge of 1% will be levied on the loan during the \ngrace period and 1.5% during the amortization period. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will enter into \na financing agreement1 with the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) acting as Executing Agency, where \nthe housing finance facility (HFF) will be set up as an independent project management unit. Funds \nwill flow from MOF to SBV/HFF in dong which will be the currency for all subsequent fund flows. \nThe funds for the institutional strengthening and capacity building component will be provided by \nMOF to HFF as a grant.

This rate will be set at a reference rate defined as the weighted average of all \n                                                 \n1  The loan term between MOF and SBV will be for 20 years, with a grace period of 5 years.

PFIs will be free to set the onlend interest rate based on the \nnegotiation between PFIs and their subborrowers. \n \nB.  HFF Margin Funds \n \n3.  HFF will retain a 1% management fee for handling subloan disbursement to PFIs. This \nmanagement fee will be retained exclusively for the use of HFF in a special account under its \ncontrol, to be used (i) to cover the operating costs of HFF-PMU (including training and capacity \nbuilding for HFF-PMU and PFIs), (ii) to cover the cost of conducting marketing campaigns to urban \nlow-income and poor households (ULIPHs) to advise them of the Project, (iii) to accumulate \nreserves for working capital when HFF becomes an independent entity, and (iv) to relend to project \nbeneficiaries. The management fee will be calculated at 1% annually on the outstanding subloans, \nand payable quarterly to HFF from PFI subloan repayments to HFF. MOF will bear the foreign \nexchange risk, from the remaining interest payments from PFIs to HFF, after deducting the HFF \nmanagement fee. \n \nC.  Accounts, Disbursement, and Payment Procedures \n4.  HFF  will  be  required  to  keep  at  least  four  separate  accounts.  Two  separate  imprest \naccounts will be opened for (i) loan fund disbursement for consulting services and equipment \npurchases, and (ii) subloan disbursements. Funds will flow from MOF to these imprest accounts. \nPayments  from  the  subloan  imprest  account  will  flow  to  PFIs  to  refinance  housing  subloan \npackages approved by HFF. In addition to the two imprest accounts, HFF will also maintain at least \ntwo other accounts. One of such accounts will be established to hold quarterly repayments on \nloans from the PFIs. Payments out of this account will be to PFIs to refinance further subloans, with \nfunds from this account to be disbursed before drawing down funds from the subloans imprest \naccount. The other account will be established to hold quarterly interest payments on HFC loans \nfrom the PFIs. HFF will deduct and retain the management fee from this account.  \n \n5.  MOF will deposit an initial amount from the ADB loan into the imprest accounts. Each PFI \nwill submit the first 10 subloans to be refinanced by HFC loans individually, and all relevant loan \nappraisal documentation to be reviewed by HFF. Subsequently, HFF will disburse housing finance \ncredit (HFC) loans to PFIs, for subloan refinancing, on the basis of lists of subloans (LOS) of not \nless  than  D500  million.  Initially,  the  LOS  will  be  accompanied  by  relevant  loan  appraisal \ndocumentation, and HFF will review and approve the documentation for 5 subloans included in the \nLOS before disbursement of HFC loans is approved. After the submission of the third LOS by any \nindividual PFI, HFF, with the concurrence of ADB, may suspend submission by PFI of loan \nappraisal  documentation  and  rely  on  monitoring  the  appraisal  documentation  during  review \nsessions that will be held at least twice a year.  \n \n6.  Each  PFI  will  be  allocated  a  guaranteed  credit  line  up  to  $2  million  for  participating \ncommercial banks (PCBs) and up to $1 million for community-based financial institutions (CFIs) for \ndrawdown over 3 years. There will be a residual HFC loan pool for the balance of loan funds to be \navailable for any PFI after it has used its guaranteed credit line, on a first-come first-served basis. \nHFF  will  review  individual  PFI  drawdown  of  the  guaranteed  credit  line  annually,  and  where \ndrawdown has been less than 30%, HFF may revise the credit line and reallocate it to the HFC \nloan pool. The maximum total accumulated principal amount for any PFI will be $7 million. This \nmechanism will provide some measure of guarantee for PFIs to commit to development and \nmarketing programs and at the same time provide an incentive to originate subloans quickly. \n ", "38  Appendix 7 \n \n7.  The project funds and the subloan repayments will provide a revolving line of credit for \nhousing finance for additional end users. Repayment of funds from HFF to MOF will be made twice \na year to correspond with the Government\u2019s loan repayments to ADB. \n \nD.  Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) \n \n8.  Six PCBs and two CFIs were selected as prequalified PFIs, which can qualify to participate \nin the Project, provided they comply with all the conditions established. Selection was based on \ntheir past experience in housing finance, commitment to participate in the Project, and financial \nindicators. The prequalified PCBs are the Asia Commercial Bank (ACB), the Bank of Investment \nand Development of Viet Nam (BIDV), Housing Development Bank of Mekong Delta (MHB), Ho \nChi Minh City Housing Bank (HHB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of Viet Nam (ICBV),  and \nSaigon Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Sacombank). Prequalified CFIs are the People\u2019s Credit \nFunds (PCF) network, and Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD). Other \nCFIs could be prequalified after the completion of the legal framework for microfinance institutions \nthat the Government will prepare in the following months. Independent auditors will prepare a \ndetailed due diligence analysis before the PFIs are fully qualified and can access project funds. \n \nE.  PFI Qualify Criteria \n \n9.  The qualifying criteria to be applied to PFIs are outlined in Table A7.1. Some criteria vary \nslightly between PCBs and CFIs. The broad qualifying standards follow. (i) Legality standards \nrequire PFIs to be established, organized and operate in compliance with regulations of SBV. \n(ii) Solvency standards assess PFIs in terms of loan portfolio quality and capital adequacy. Two \nmajor financial indicators reflect the loan portfolio quality: total overdue balance over total loan \nportfolio and net bad debts over total loan portfolio. Capital adequacy is reflected by the own \ncapital or net equity over risk assets: the lower the overdue rate and the higher the capital \nadequacy ratio, the more solvent the PFI will be. (iii) Liquidity standards assess the capacity of \nPFIs to convert assets into cash or liquid assets to cover short-term liabilities, indicated by the \ncurrent ratio and the medium- and long-term loan portfolio over medium- and long-term sources. \n(iv) Profitability and efficiency standards assess the capacity of PFIs in utilizing resources, which \nare reflected by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). (v) Management quality of \nstaff  standards  address  whether  PFIs  have  staff  with  managerial  and  professional  skills  in \naccordance with SBV-stipulated regulations.  \n \n10.  The eligibility for qualification of PFIs and rates defined are derived from international \nstandards and the prudential norms issued by SBV (e.g., capital adequacy, liquidity, classification \nand provisioning for nonperforming loans, and lending concentration). HFF is entitled to consider \nthe  refinement  of  specific  qualifying  criteria  in  concurrence  with  ADB  in  the  process  of  PFI \nqualification. When calculating the financial ratios, the results of the last 3 completed financial \nyears will be used, to take account of abnormal annual fluctuations. The criteria were applied to the \nprequalified PFI during appraisal and the results are in Table A7. 2.  \n \nF.  PFI Loan Arrangements \n \n11.  Qualified PFIs will be required to sign a housing finance credit (HFC) loan agreement with \nHFF before housing loan refinancing for beneficiary subloans can be accessed. The HFC loan \nagreement  will  define  (i)  eligible  housing  subborrowers;  (ii)  subloan  terms  and  conditions; \n(iii) subloan management; and (iv) audit, supervision, and reporting requirements.  \n ", "Appendix 7  39 \n12.  Before  starting  disbursements,  each  PFI  will  establish  a  specially  dedicated  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) to manage all aspects of the HFC loan and subloan origination and \nmanagement procedures. \n \nG.  PFI Loan Terms \n \n1.  Eligible Subborrowers and Subloan Purpose \n \n13.  Eligible housing subborrowers will be defined in the loan agreements as households having \na monthly income in the range of D350-750,000 for CFIs and D0.75-3.5 million for PCBs. Eligible \nsubloan purposes for PCBs will be housing purchase with a maximum subloan value of D70 million \n(maximum house price of D100million) and small home improvement with a maximum value of D20 \nmillion. For CFIs, eligible loans will be for small home improvement and own-build housing with a \nmaximum  cost  of  D15  million.  The  maximum  subloan  for  new  housing  and  home \nimprovement/upgrade will be equal to 70% of the house value or house upgrade cost.  \n \n14.  During project preparation, extensive discussions were undertaken with potential PFIs, \nhousing construction companies, housing development agencies, as well as surveys and focus \ngroup discussions with urban low-income and poor households (ULIPHs) to get a cross section of \ninformation and views on appropriate ULIPH loan eligibility criteria and maximum levels. The \nmaximum housing component levels were set based on appropriate existing and proposed ULIPH \nhousing projects successfully completed and sold, detailed feasibility studies of planned ULIPH \nprojects and the experience of ULIPHs purchasing such housing. Subloan terms were developed \nin consultation with potential PFIs, and reflect the experience of existing ULIPH housing loans from \nbanks specializing in this category of borrowers, and the views of ULIPHs surveyed (see Appendix \n4 \u2013 Summary of Survey Findings, for details). \n \n2.  Capital Contribution and Risk \n \n15.  PFIs  will  provide  from  their  own  resources  capital  equal  to  20%  of  the  subloans  to \nborrowers from PCBs and 10% of the subloans to borrowers from CFIs, reflecting the lower capital \nbase of most microfinance CFIs. This contribution is regarded as important, as it means PFIs share \nsome of the risk associated with lending to the target group. Subborrowers will contribute some \n30% of their housing costs, ensuring they have significant equity in their housing project. In line \nwith the move into a commercially driven domestic market economy, all risks inherent to subloans \nmade by PFIs will be borne by the PFI that originates the subloan. Upon the failure of a PFI to \nrepay the principal and or interest due on a HFC loan, HFF will have the right to call either the \noutstanding balance of the PFI\u2019s entire HFC loan portfolio or the specific HFC loan or loans in \ndefault (based on the circumstances of that default and the financial condition of the PFI) and \nsuspend the right of the PFI to obtain further HFC loans. \n \n3.  Interest Rates \n \n16.  HFC loans from the HFF to PFIs will be at a variable interest rate adjusted quarterly and set \nat the weighted average of all time deposits in the banking system as computed and informed by \nSBV at the end of each quarter. Interest rates for subloans will be in accordance with the interest \nrate policy of each PFI. Subborrowers will be given a choice of fixed rate (prevailing variable rate \nas defined above plus a premium) for the term of the subloan, or a variable rate periodically \nadjusted. \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \n \n4.  Collateral \n \n17.  Subloans through PCBs will be mortgage based, requiring subborrowers to provide land \nuse rights certificates (LURCs) or, where appropriate, building ownership and land use certificates \n(BOLUCs) for collateral. Microfinance CFI subborrowers will generally provide individual or group \nguarantees or similar collateral (both physical and moral guarantees), though the provision of \nLURC and BOLUC will be encouraged for subloans more than D10 million.  \n \n5.  Other Subloan Conditions \n \n18.  The maximum subloan term would be 20 years. HFC loans from HFF to PFIs will be for the \nterm of the subloans.  \n ", "Appendix 7  41 \nTable A7.1: Criteria for Qualification of PFIs \n    Required Standards \nCriteria     PCBs  CFIs \nA.

Background and Rationale \n \n1.  In Viet Nam, the major funding source of retail banks, deposits, is usually of short term. \nConsequently, most of the mortgage loans originated have short maturity (1-5 years, with a \npredominance of 1 year), which has a serious impact on the affordability of housing for urban low- \nincome and poor households (ULIPHs). To address this constraint, banks specializing in housing \nfinance have three alternatives: (i) be heavily capitalized, (ii) raise institutional savings on the \ncapital market, or (iii) create long-term saving instruments to offer to their clients. The first option \nis presently being addressed in the banking sector reform program through individual bank \nrecapitalization plans. The second option will develop with the emergence of pension funds, \ninsurance funds, and long-term institutional investors in Viet Nam. The third option can be \nimmediately  implemented  should  the  banks  develop  innovative  loan-savings  products  and \nimprove their marketing. Vietnamese banks have limited experience in the retail sector and \nmarketing savings products that could satisfy people presently resorting to land purchase or \ndeposits for the purpose of capital appreciation. Banks have to offer their customers new savings \nproducts, most likely (i) linked to loan access; (ii) incorporating a higher interest differential for \nlong-term savings accounts; (iii) with multiple interest rate levels; and (iv) more sophisticated than \nsimply based on a single interest rate. The deposits raised by banks are still too short term \ndespite the incentive provided by State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), which does not impose any \nreserve requirement on deposits of more than one year. \n \n2.  The core  of the strategy in Viet Nam\u2019s housing finance sector should be to boost the \nmobilization of private savings and channel them toward the housing sector. The limited public \nresources raised by the Government should be used only as leverage for expanding private \nsavings, for instance, through the provision of urban infrastructure. The short-term strategic \napproach should aim at assisting the whole Vietnamese banking sector in raising long-term \nresources, implementing sound working methods, and offering adequate savings products and \nlong term mortgage instruments to their customers to develop the primary mortgage market. The \nmedium-term strategic approach should aim at creating a secondary market facility (SMF) in \nhousing finance. The creation of a SMF requires the existence of an efficient primary mortgage \nmarket  whose  main  prerequisites  are  (i)  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment,  (ii)  a  well-\nfunctioning  titling  and  mortgage  registration  system,  (iii)  mortgages  that  are  attractive \ninvestments,  (iv) standardization  of  mortgages,  (v) proper  origination  techniques,  (vi)  proper \nservicing techniques, and (vii) existence of potential investors. Not all these prerequisites are \nsatisfied in Viet Nam and there is a need to prepare both the conditions for a more efficient \nprimary market and the conditions for an emerging secondary mortgage market in the near future. \n \n3.  The development of an efficient housing mortgage market in Viet Nam, then, requires the \nestablishment of a specialized agency, the housing finance  facility (HFF) that will be initially \nplaced within SBV. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will provide initial resources to HFF \nto start its operations on a pilot basis with the objective of developing the national housing finance \nsector. The establishment of HHF with support from an ADB loan will lead to the (i) development \nof an efficient primary mortgage market accessible to ULIPHs by institutionalizing the standards \nand procedures of the HFF within the participating financial institutions (PFIs); and (ii) building up \nof basic requirements for the emergence of a secondary mortgage market in the future. \n \n4.  This institutional creation and development process provides the primary reason why HFF \nneeds to be an apex institution and distinguishes the revolving fund activities of HFF from a \nproject involving only subloan distribution and recycling activity. Setting up revolving funds in \neach PFI would diffuse housing finance sector policy and development activity and would not lead \nto the creation of a sustainable housing loan refinancing market. Establishing an apex HFF within ", "46  Appendix 9 \nan existing commercial bank would also inhibit the development of a sustainable housing loan \nrefinancing market because of (i) the conflict of interest between that bank\u2019s apex wholesale \nbanking  function  and  its  retail  housing  finance  function;  and  (ii)  the  inhibiting  influence  of \ncompetitive commercial banks disclosing retail housing finance activities to a competitor. Ideally, \nHFF should be a separately incorporated and independent agency, but as this is a pilot loan \ntesting mechanism, it is appropriate to initially establish HFF inside SBV, as the implicit authority \nof SBV will ensure sound principles of effective governance and facilitate the acceptance of \nprudential operating standards. The relocation of HFF will be examined in the project midterm \nreview, and the necessary steps will be to transform it into an independent mortgage refinance \nagency (MRA) agreed upon before the end of project implementation. \n \nB.  Mandate and Objectives \n \n5.  The mandate of HFF is to develop a sound and self-sustaining housing finance system in \nViet Nam by establishing a network of housing finance outlets across the country. Its primary \nobjectives will be to (i) promote and assist the housing finance sector, (ii) provide advisory \nservices and technical assistance in operational policies to PFIs, (iii) mobilize new resources for \nthe housing sector, and (iv) address legal and institutional constraints to the development of the \nhousing finance system. \n \nC.

Status of HFF \n \n7.  HFF will be an autonomous operating unit, with its own operational budget, financial \naccounts, suitable equipment, and permanent staff under the authority of a Project director. The \ndirector of HFF will report to the governor of SBV.  \n \nE.  HFF Tasks as PMU of the Project \n \n8.  HFF will be responsible for managing the ADB loan revolving fund, as the apex institution \nfor subloan refinancing and repayments through the PFIs, with the default risk of subloans \nremaining with the PFIs. HFF will be the focal point for ADB and the local organizations in respect \nof all matters relating to implementation, management, and coordination of the Project, including \n(i) qualification of PFIs and monitoring their financial performance; (ii) approving PFIs' subloan \napplications according to housing finance credit (HFC) loan agreement terms; (iii) monitoring \nproject implementation and preparing reports; (iv) paying principal and interest to the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) for repayment of the ADB Loan; (v) carrying out studies and surveys pertaining to \nhousing finance development in the country; (vi) selecting, contracting and supervising capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening consulting and training services; (vii) providing support to \nSBV and MOF in policy matters relating to housing finance; (viii) carrying out  accounting for all \nproject activities, including bookkeeping, disbursement to PFIs, and recording of collections and \nrepayments; and (ix) carrying out procurement activities under the Project. A more detailed \noutline of selected specific tasks to be undertaken by HFF follows. \n \n1.  Contractual Housing-Savings Schemes \n \n9.  Such schemes are an effective way to finance housing through a mechanism where an \nULIPH undertakes to save a specified amount over a prescribed period of time and the PFI \nundertakes to grant, at the end of that period, a loan whose amount and term depend on the \namount of savings accumulated. The advantage of such a scheme is that it reduces the element \nof uncertainty, both for the PFI, which can more easily project its financial commitments, and for \nthe ULIPH, who knows for certain that it can obtain a housing loan at the end of the agreed upon \nperiod. A specific task of HFF will be to facilitate the development and introduction of such \nschemes through a consultative and product development support program to PFIs. \n \n2.  Microcredit Deposit Savings Schemes \n \n10.  The  rationale  of  saving  for  housing  loan  products  derives  from  the  principles  that \n(i) private deposits are the backbone of any financial institution; (ii) households perceive housing \nas the first objective worth saving for; (iii) knowing the savings behavior of the future borrowers \nhelps in assessing the personal credit risk; and (iv) by linking prior savings and borrowing by the \nsame household, it is possible to use the savings as collateral for the loan. Applying this rationale, \nmicrocredit organizations  lend for home improvement to groups of poor households on the \nstrength of prior collective group savings. The groups are responsible for dealing with individual \nsavings  collection,  lending,  and  loan  repayments  themselves.  In  many  cases,  this  means \nintermediation, with cost savings for the microcredit intermediary institution, as it has to deal with \nonly one (larger) loan for the group, rather than with a number of smaller loans for individuals. \nThe outreach is better and, even if the net cost of the additional layer as reflected in the interest \nrate for the end user is higher, credit still reaches the households at more favorable terms than \nthose of informal sources of funds accessible to them. A specific task of HFF will be to facilitate ", "48  Appendix 9 \ndeveloping  and  introducing such schemes through a consultative and product development \nsupport program to PFIs. Common features of these products include: (i) 2-3 years prior savings \nwill be required to provide guaranteed access to a housing loan of at least four times the built-up \nsavings; (ii) credit terms will be market based, with a medium- to long-term repayment period; and \n(iii) the savings-for-loan product will generally be group-based, supported by mass organizations \nsuch as the Women\u2019s Union and by nongovernment organizations (NGOs.)  \n \n3.  Awareness and Marketing Campaign \n \n11.  ULIPHs  have  limited  knowledge  of  and  access  to  PFIs,  particularly  participating \ncommercial banks (PCBs). To maximize access to the project subloans at PFIs, it is important to \nensure that ULIPHs are aware of the Project and the ease of access to such subloans. In addition \nto the normal loan product marketing that PFIs will undertake at their own expense, HFF needs to \nprovide  a  generic  housing  finance  awareness  and  marketing  program.  This  program  will \nspecifically target ULIPHs and will aim to inform them of the (i) purpose and benefits of long-term \nhousing loans; (ii) cost and affordability of long term loans through PFIs; (iii) ULIPH eligibility for \nsubloans; (iv) eligible housing finance subloan purposes, maximum loan levels, and other loan \nconditions; (v) procedures for obtaining information and applying for such loans; (vi) contact \ndetails for obtaining further information; and (vii) a step-by-step checklist for determining their \neligibility for a project subloan and obtaining approval for such subloan. Such an awareness and \nmarketing program will emphasize simplicity and ease of access. \n \n4.  HFF Housing Finance Demand Database \n \n12.  There are a large number of housing development projects to resettle ULIPHs, upgrade \nshanty areas, provide major employee housing, and improve government employee housing in \nthe urban areas of Viet Nam. As no central database of such projects exists, it is essential that \nHFF develop such a database and assist PFIs to directly target ULIPHs associated with such \nprojects. These projects have a number of advantages: (i) land and infrastructure service costs \nfor resettlement housing areas are generally included in the external assistance projects or \ncontributed by the relevant People\u2019s Committee agency from their own funds, thus reducing total \nhousing costs if they are passed on to the resettled households; (ii) they usually have designated \nhousing resettlement areas and a choice of appropriate housing options; (iii) most resettled \nhouseholds receive compensation at replacement cost, providing a contribution to the deposit \nrequirements for housing loans if they decide to improve their houses; and (iv) often they have \nsocial survey inputs, community consultation, and savings credit schemes to prepare households \nfor relocation. These groups include a significant proportion of the project target ULIPHs. Few, if \nany, belong to higher income groups, thus eliminating a potential leakage of project loan funds to \nincome groups above the low-income band.  \n \n5.  Mortgage Guarantee Fund/Mortgage Insurance Scheme \n \n13.  PFIs have concerns about the risks of lending to ULIPHs, particularly regarding the \nsecurity of household earnings. This concern could be limited through either a Government- \nbacked mortgage guarantee fund, or through a mortgage insurance scheme. It could involve joint \ncontributions by Government and PFIs to build up a fund that could be accessed to pay part or all \nof the residual debts arising from defaulting subloans. A mortgage insurance scheme could be \nestablished through an insurance company willing to provide a special housing finance protection \npolicy that covers housing subloan payments for subborrowers who experience earning losses \ndue to job loss, temporary or permanent disability, or death as well as property loss due to fire. \nThis is a premium-based insurance product and the monthly premium can be added to a \nsubborrower\u2019s subloan repayment schedule. The HFF will conceive and design features of a \nmortgage insurance scheme targeting low-income households. ", "Appendix 9  49\nF.  HFF Organizational Structure and Staff  \n \n14.   HFF will be managed by a project director and a full-time project manager and staffed with \nat least 15 full-time professional staff including the project director and project manager, and five \nsupporting staff. HFF will have four divisions (Figure A9).

In addition, the survey will include feedback, through focus group \ndiscussions  or  other  mechanisms,  from  beneficiary  households,  PFIs,  and  intermediary \norganizations involved with microfinance mechanisms, on the project benefits as well as specific \nactions that will enhance the Project\u2019s impact. The results of the survey will be incorporated into \nthe midterm review findings \n \nB.  Specific Terms of Reference \n \n1.  Policy Review \n \n3.  The review will carefully examine progress made by the Government in key policy areas \nimpacting on the development of the housing finance sector, namely, (i)  developing a national \nhousing finance orientation (policy); (ii) increasing the number of urban land use certificates issued \nand improvement in registration procedures; (iii); improving in the legal procedures for calling up \ndefaulting  mortgages  and  selling  mortgaged  land  and  houses;  (iv)  improving  the  mortgage \nregistration system; (v) improving the valuation system for land and houses; (vi) improving banking \nsector  performance;  (vii)  promoting  household  savings  in  PFIs  for  housing  purchase  and \nimprovement; (viii) attracting additional funds to the housing sector; and (ix) introducing a mortgage \ninsurance scheme or mortgage guarantee fund. In addition, the review will examine compliance \nwith other conditions and covenants of the Project. \n \n2.  Implementation Performance \n \n4.  The review will (i) compare the actual implementation performance with the agreed-upon \nimplementation  program  and  will  determine  the  Project\u2019s  success  to  date  in  meeting  the ", "58  Appendix 13 \n \nestablished targets; (ii) critically assess the achievements and limitations of the Project based on \nthe first 2 \u00bd years\u2019 performance and identify existing and possible constraints impeding project \nperformance; and (iii) formulate and recommend appropriate countermeasures and modifications \nto overcome the identified weaknesses and deficiencies. \n \n3.  Performance of PFIs \n \n5.  The  review  will  evaluate  PFI  compliance  with  the  participation  criteria,  including  the \nbeneficiary household income range, lending terms, and use of subloan funds. The effectiveness \nof these criteria and of the PFIs to increase ULIPH access to housing finance will be assessed, \nand modifications will be proposed as required. The drawdown rate of the PFIs will be evaluated \nand, if insufficient, changes will be proposed to increase the funding available to ULIPH borrowers. \n \n4.  HFF Evaluation \n \n6.  The review will assess the progress of HFF toward a MRA as a first step along the path to a \nfully functioning secondary market facility (SMF). The review will consider (i) the functioning status \nof  the  titling  and  mortgage  registration  system;  (ii)  quality  and  standardization  of  mortgage \ndocumentation; (iii) procedures and quality of mortgage origination in PFIs; (iv) PFI housing loan \nmanagement and defaulting loan procedures; (v) level of development of the primary mortgage \nmarket; (vi) status and effectiveness of legal procedures for calling up defaulting mortgages and \nselling mortgaged land and houses; (vii) existence of mortgage market potential investors or long- \nterm finance credit lines; and (viii) stage of mortgage refinancing activity attained by the HFF. The \nreview will examine the merits of keeping HFF as an independent operating unit within SBV, \nconsider alternative locations and the desirability of establishing it as an independent MRA, and \nrecommend a timetable for this evolutionary process. A timetable will be agreed upon by ADB and \nthe Government to establish it as a separate independent MRA, at the latest, at the end of the \nproject implementation period. \n \n5.  Review of Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  Consultants\u2019 Performance \n \n7.  The review will assess (i) the consultant\u2019s performance in terms of work output in relation to \ntheir  terms  of  reference,  and  assistance  provided  to  HFF  and  PFIs  among  others;  (ii)  the \nrelationship among the consultants, HFF, government agencies, and PFIs; (iii) the consultant\u2019s \noverall  compliance  with  the  agreed-upon  terms  of  reference;  and  (iv)  any  further  needs  for \nconsulting services. The review will recommend appropriate modifications to ensure successful \nproject implementation. \n \nb.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n8.  The review will incorporate the findings of the PPMS survey implemented in anticipation of \nthe mission into the midterm review findings; and make recommendations to modify the PPMS, as \nrequired, to better capture project impacts. \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R332-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021129084436Z", "Title": "R332-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030206085433+08'00'"}, "author_page": "SMF  \u2013  secondary market facility \nSOCB  \u2013  State-owned commercial bank \nSOE  \u2013  statement of expenditure \nSOEN  \u2013  state-owned enterprise \nULIH  \u2013  urban low-income household \nULIPH  \u2013  urban low-income and poor household \nUPH  \u2013  urban poor household \nVLSS  \u2013  Viet Nam living standard survey \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n  This report was prepared by a team consisting of: A.
