Key \nfunctions and institutions of the Government have to be altered to respond to the immense \nchanges taking place. As decentralization should lead to balanced development, managing \nregional disparities in economic and poverty reduction programs is a major central government \nresponsibility. The Government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance during \nthe 2001 Country Programming Mission to support an advisory technical assistance (ADTA) \nproject to address this issue. An ADTA project\u2014Managing Regional Disparity in Economic and \nPoverty Reduction Programs under Decentralization\u2014was programmed for 2002. ADB staff \nundertook fact finding in June-November 2002, and reached a broad understanding with the \nGovernment on the project\u2019s design and scope.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  decentralization  program  has  devolved  vast  responsibilities  on  regional \ngovernments. Under Laws 22 and 25 of 1999, which underpin decentralization, other than \nforeign policy, defense, security, judiciary, monetary and fiscal matters, and religious affairs, \nalmost all other matters are being devolved to regional2 governments in 31 provinces and about \n360 districts and cities. The primary responsibility to provide basic services as well as the \nnational3 effort to reduce poverty will now mainly be their responsibility. However, the fiscal \ncapacities of regional governments vary considerably, hindering the national effort to reduce \npoverty. Many governments in regions with large numbers of poor have inadequate resources to \naccelerate overall development, particularly in rural areas, and to reduce poverty and continue \nthe previous central government-assisted efforts begun before decentralization.  \n \n3.  Wide  disparity  exists  among  regional  governments  in  poverty  reduction,  human \ndevelopment, and access to development resources. Although Indonesia made rapid progress \nin poverty reduction before the Asian economic crisis, incidence of poverty sharply increased \nduring the crisis. The 1999 National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS) revealed that 23.5% \nof the population was poor (current estimates are 17%). Recent data indicate that, nationally, \nreal wages are at about 20% below the precrisis levels, suggesting persistent poverty. As part of \nits  geographical  focus  strategy  for  Indonesia, ADB found considerable disparity in poverty \nincidence, human development, and access to financial resources among regions. Before \ndecentralization,  the  central  government  directly  addressed  this  issue,  particularly  poverty \nreduction, through a nationally  driven effort that focused on rapid and sustained growth of \nagriculture, high growth in nonagricultural sectors, high investments in human development, and \ntargeted  poverty  programs.4  Under  decentralization,  the  coordinated  national  effort  might \nweaken, and institutional arrangements, particularly, might not be adequate to reduce economic \nand social disparities across regions.  \n \n4.  The fiscal instruments available after decentralization to achieve equity in providing \nbasic  services  and  reducing  economic  disparities  are  ineffective  and  insufficient.  The \ndecentralization laws provide for revenue sharing under the General Allocation Fund (DAU), \ngrant transfers under the Special Allocation Fund (DAK), and market borrowing by regional \ngovernments.  However,  due  to  the  absence  of  proper  guidelines  and  execution,  these \n                                                 \n1    The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in April 2002. \n2    The term \u201cregion\u201d refers to province, district and city \n3    Throughout this paper, \u201cnational\u201d refers to the country as a whole, embracing center and regions.     \n4   The most prominent among the latter was the grant-based 20,000-village INPRES Desa Tertinggal program    \n     launched in 1993. ", "2 \ninstruments are ineffective. Although the allocation formula for DAU, for instance, has strong \nfeatures to support equity (such as weight on population and level of income), stipulations of \nParliament that allocations received should not fall below the previous year's allocation have \nseverely  limited  DAU\u2019s  effectiveness.  DAK  guidelines  are  yet  to  be  finalized,  although \nallocations for 2003 have been made in some sectors. The regional borrowing instrument is not \nin  operation  as  the  central  government  has,  in  the  interest  of  fiscal  prudence,  placed  a \ntemporary moratorium on the instrument\u2019s use. The central government has not yet developed a \nframework for intergovernmental fiscal relations or a detailed policy of fiscal support to weaker \nregional governments for development and poverty reduction.  \n \n5.  Law 22 of 1999 provides that national planning and national development should be \ncentral government responsibilities. The supporting regulations are being finalized by National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). Current thinking focuses mainly on coordination \nof national development goals and priorities with local ones, to be reflected ultimately in the \nmain planning documents at the central and regional levels (National Development Program \n[PROPENAS],  Regional  Development  Program  [PROPEDA],  Regional  Strategic  Plan \n[RENSTRADA], Regional Annual Development Plan [REPETADA], etc.). Formal coordination \nmeetings between agencies responsible for the various levels of planning have been prescribed \nat the district/city, provincial, and national levels through the Development Coordination Forums \n(RAKORBANG). The Government has so far held three large national RAKORBANG workshops \nsince decentralization.5 Discussion has also begun on monitoring and evaluation of planning \noutcomes although nothing concrete has emerged. \n \n6.  The centralized planning system has to give way to one responsive to the challenges of \ndecentralization.  However,  the  discourse  on  developing  a  new  system  of  central-regional \ndevelopment relationships could clearly benefit from insights into the following three main areas. \n \n7.  First, the planning and budgeting process at the regional level is not sufficiently geared \nto reduce poverty, and the consultative validation with the central government of strategic \npriorities\u2013-particularly those that should be transformed into programs for implementation\u2013-is \nweak. To begin with, these plans should be poverty oriented and realistic. Financing of the plans \nis not emphasized and the central government\u2019s role in supporting regions\u2019 pro-poor planning is \nnot adequately defined. Although RAKORBANG provides for consultation, the process has not \nbeen sufficiently structured to yield meaningful results. This is partly because the end results of \nthe consultations\u2014the annual plans\u2014are not sufficiently grounded on resource considerations \nand are, therefore, often unrealistic, making them inadequate tools for development and poverty \nreduction. The process also appears to need a higher degree of systematic technical evaluation \nof regional development plans and adequate representation of stakeholders such as civil society \nand the private sector.  \n \n8.  Second, resource planning remains weak. The regional development strategies and \nannual plans are limited by lack of resources. The central government plays virtually no role in \nmaking resources available for priorities agreed upon at the regional level. Discussions on the \narchitecture for intergovernmental fiscal relations are taking place independently of the planning \nprocess. So far, most discussions have centered around revenue sharing, and discussions \nbeyond that on funding development (such as DAK) are at a preliminary stage (para. 4.) \n                                                 \n5    A workshop of the Development Coordination Forum for central government agencies (RAKORBANGPUS) was \nalso conducted in September 2002, emphasizing poverty  reduction, employment generation, development of \nlagging regions, and human resource development. The workshop also emphasized sharing information on \ncentral government budgetary allocations with regions. ", "    3 \n \n9.  Finally, the process pays no attention to a major central government responsibility: \nfostering regional balance and facilitating reduction of regional disparities by focusing on the \nneeds  of  weaker  regions.  Regional  governments  with  insufficient revenues from revenue \nsharing and own revenue mobilization efforts will require assistance to generate development \nfunds  for  high-priority  programs.  The  Committee  on  Poverty  Reduction  established  under \nPresidential Decree (Kepres) 124 of 2001 mandates BAPPENAS to develop basic policy on \nmacro planning involving regional governments and other stakeholders. An area-based poverty \nprofile has to be developed and all sources of funding\u2014public, private, and from the financial \nsector\u2014tapped.  The  committee  will  rely  on  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to  coordinate \ndevelopment programs at the regional level. This work may need to be coordinated with the \nongoing development of the architecture for decentralized planning. \n \n10.  Although BAPPENAS is strongly committed to bring about improvements along the \nabove lines, given the scale of work required, the central and regional governments should be \nprepared to address the problems mentioned. Central draft regulations for regional planning and \nbudgeting are under development and must be supported. First, however, the ideas to be \nincorporated into these regulations need to be pilot-tested. Five poor regional governments will \nbe selected under this TA for this purpose.  \n \n11.  Although Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and United States Agency for \nInternational  Development  (USAID)  provided  some  bilateral  support  for  some  aspects  of \nregional planning, they do not address the issue of achieving equity in the distribution of fiscal \nresources for fighting poverty. The ADTA\u2019s support will fit in well with ADB's overall activities in \nsupport of decentralization, and the coordinated funding agencies' efforts in this area.6 Apart \nfrom  an  institutional  structure  for  decentralized  planning,  regional  governments  need \nconsiderable capacity building. A capacity-building project for regional governments, including in \nplanning and development,7 is programmed for 2002 and can utilize the TA outputs. During TA \nimplementation, learning from all relevant funding agency-assisted activities,8 past and ongoing, \nwill be incorporated. \n \nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  With  decentralization,  poor  regional  governments  have  little  capability  to  promote \ndevelopment and fight poverty. The TA\u2019s goal is to support processes and/or procedures to \nimprove pro-poor planning and develop recommendations for a national program of action to \nreduce regional disparities and poverty. The TA will identify pragmatic approaches to ensure \nthat poor regions have adequate resources and support to deliver basic services and to pursue \ndevelopment programs, particularly in reducing poverty, to catch up with the better-off regions of \nthe country. The TA will help the Government pilot-test policies and systems in one province, \none city, and three districts (Appendix 1). \n \n                                                 \n6    The Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI) Working Group on Poverty Reduction has also sought support in this \narea. \n7    Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization Project, programmed for 2002. \n8    Such as World Bank's Kecamatan Development Project. ", "4 \nB.  Key Activities and Methodology \n13.  Central and regional government readiness to make planning and budgeting practices \npro-poor is uncertain. A key outcome of this TA is an assessment of such readiness. The \nfollowing activities are involved: \n \n(i)  Select  five  of  the  poorest  regional  governments  which  show  readiness  to \nundertake sound pro-poor planning and budgeting practices, and help them build \ncapacity in these areas utilizing national and international best practices. \n(ii)  In  these  selected  regional  governments,  pilot-test  consultative  processes \nbetween  regional  and  central  governments  and  hold  consultations  with \nstakeholders such as civil society and the private sector. Develop best processes \nto ensure that local conditions are adequately reflected in the plans. Study the \nRAKORBANG process to improve its effectiveness so that it leads to a concrete \nvalidated  development  strategy,  agreed  between  the  central  and  selected \nregional governments, including agreements on minimum  quality of services \nprovided through detailed annual inventory of projects and schemes based on \ntechnical analyses and clear annual budgeting of resources for development. \nHelp the central government develop processes to validate these plans. \n(iii)  Based on needs of the five regions and their validated pro-poor plans, provide \nadvice on financial support mechanisms from the regions\u2019 own and outside \nsources to support the plans. Explore coordinating arrangements and the role of \nthe central government in enabling regions to utilize the whole range of fiscal and \nother instruments to provide needed development resources, including grants \nthrough DAK, block loans from the center to the regions, external assistance, \nnational schemes supported by cost-sharing between the center and the regions, \nnational resource mobilization through market borrowings by regions facilitated \nby the center, improved provision of resources from the financial system for \npoverty reduction programs (such as microcredit), private sector participation, \nand participation by civil society.  \n \n14.  Based on these regions\u2019 experience, the TA will propose to the central government \nalternative development-cum-financing arrangements to support sustainable development and \nfocus on reducing regional disparities and poverty, and enable the central government to finalize \nits draft regulations on regional planning under preparation. A follow-on ADTA (phase 2) will be \nprepared  to  utilize  the  experience  gathered  from  this  TA  to  make  national-level \nrecommendations, particularly with respect to methods to determine if regional plans are pro-\npoor, and to advise on mechanisms to identify and broker alternative funds for poor regions left \nwith gaps in their resources to support pro-poor initiatives. Phase-II will also cover the issue of \nmechanisms to monitor expenditures to ensure that they achieve pro-poor outcomes. \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing Plan \n15.  The total TA cost is estimated at $605,000 equivalent, of which $270,000 is the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $335,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $484,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, and \n$214,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed as a grant from the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom. The Government of Indonesia will bear the balance of \n$121,000 equivalent of the local currency cost by providing office facilities, administrative ", "    5 \nsupport,  and  remuneration  and  per  diem  of  counterpart  staff  and  their  local  transport \n(Appendix  2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency will be BAPPENAS (under the deputy minister for local autonomy \nand  regional  development).  A  steering  committee  will  be  established,  comprising \nrepresentatives from the Offices of the Coordinating Ministers for the Economy and for Peoples' \nWelfare, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Committee on Poverty Reduction, the \nChamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN), civil society, and the five concerned regional \ngovernments. The steering committee members are expected to provide coordination and \ndetailed advice to the consultants during the tripartite meetings based on the reports (para. 18) \nsubmitted to them before meetings. BAPPENAS, the EA, will establish a project management \noffice (PMO), at least 1 month before the TA starts and keep it fully functional during TA \nimplementation. One staff member at the appropriate level will be designated full-time to head \nthe PMO and will be responsible for coordination, facilitation, and supervision of the consultants\u2019 \nwork. The EA will provide adequate administrative support for the consultants.  \n \n17.  ADB will select and engage, using the simplified technical proposal, a firm or consortium \nof international and domestic consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. A \ntotal  of  12  person-months  of  international  and  24  person-months  of  domestic  experts  (in \ndecentralized  planning  and  public  finance,  poverty  reduction  and  decentralization  law)  is \nanticipated to be required to implement the TA. The work of the consultants is expected to \ncommence in March 2003 and continue for 8 months, the expected TA duration. The outline \nterms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n \n18.  Wide  stakeholder  consultations  (including  with  those  engaged  in  external  funding \nagency supported activities) through workshops will be essential. The consultants will prepare a \nbrief inception report after the first fortnight, an interim report after the end of 4 months, a draft \nfinal report in the middle of the eighth month of the TA, and a final report at the end of the eighth \nmonth. These reports will be circulated in advance (at least 5 days before meetings) to steering \ncommittee members and discussed at tripartite meetings consisting of the Government (steering \ncommittee members), consultants, and ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $484,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for \nManaging  Regional  Disparity  in  Economic  and  Poverty  Reduction  Programs  Under \nDecentralization (Phase 1), and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n   \n \n  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms \nGoal  \u2022  Pro-poor planning and  \u2022  Regional  \u2022  (A) The central and national \nSupport processes and/or  budgeting in target  government plans  governments are fully \nprocedures to improve pro-poor  regions   and budgets  committed to reduce \nplanning and develop  \u2022  Sufficient response to    poverty. \nrecommendations for a national  suggest feasibility of   \nprogram of action to reduce  replication on national  \u2022  ADB review \nregional disparities and poverty   scale   missions \nPurpose      \u2022  (R) The Government, while \nDevelop, through pilot testing in five  \u2022  Enhanced capacity in  \u2022  ADB reviews of  interested in issuing \npoor regions pro-poor planning  five pilot regional  capacity in  guidelines for pro-poor \npractices involving central  governments to  regional  regional planning, may not \ngovernment and stakeholders, pro- undertake pro-poor  governments  adequately appreciate the \npoor regional plans that are realistic  planning   need for pro-poor planning \nand fully funded to achieve pro-poor  \u2022  (R) The political \noutcomes  environment and \nrelationship with regions \nmay not be conducive to \ncarrying out the TA. \nOutputs       \n\u2022  Five regions helped with training  \u2022  Five such pro-poor  \u2022  Workshops to  \u2022  (A) The regions are fully \nto improve capacities to prepare  plans developed,  review outputs and  committed to undertake \npro-poor regional plans   leading to improved  develop  pro-poor planning. \n\u2022  Improved RAKORBANG process  allocations and well- recommendations  \u2022  (R) The regions may resist \ninvolving technical evaluation of  designed projects and  for adoption of  being subjected to central \nregional plans and participatory  schemes for poverty  phase 2 of the TA  validation processes.  \nprocesses to ensure that local  reduction  \u2022  (R) The regions may not \nconditions are adequately    accept central guidelines. \nreflected in the plans  \u2022  Improved \n\u2022  Identified funding sources for  RAKORBANG \nregional plans pilot-tested in five  process used to \nregions  prepare five regional \n\u2022  BAPPENAS helped to finalize the  plans \npolicy and regulatory framework   \nand operational guidelines on  \u2022  Policy and regulatory \nplanning and budgeting for  framework and \nregional planning  operational guidelines \nfinalized by \nBAPPENAS based on \nconsultancy inputs  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nActivities      (A) The concerned parties \n\u2022  Inception workshop  \u2022  ADB review  participate properly and \n\u2022  Regional training workshops  missions  provide inputs on time. \n\u2022  Interim workshop  Central and regional \n\u2022  Draft final report workshop  governments and \n\u2022  Final workshop  stakeholders provide \nadequate support to the \nactivities.  \n \n Inputs      \u2022  (A)  Consultants  provide \n\u2022  ADB TA grant of $484,000   \u2022  ADB and  inputs  according  to  TA \n\u2022  Consultancy and other TA  government  Terms of Reference \nsupport  contribution to  \u2022  (A)  Central  and  regional \n\u2022  Government counterpart  TA resources  governments  provide  full \nsupport of $121,000  (Appendix 2)  counterpart support. \n\u2022  Stakeholder inputs  \u2022  (A)  All  stakeholders  fully \nsupport  the  project  and \nprovide necessary inputs \n \nADB=Asian  Development  Bank,  BAPPENAS=  Badan  Perencanaan  Pembangunan  Nasional  (National \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency)  RAKORBANG=  Rapat  Koordinasi  Pembangunan  (Development  \nCoordination Forum), TA=Technical Assistance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($) \n               \n             \nForeign  Local  Total \nItem \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n             \nA.
