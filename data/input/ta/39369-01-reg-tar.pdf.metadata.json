INTRODUCTION \n1.  The regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Carbon \nFinancing for Regional Grassland Management in Northeast Asia1 is a continuation of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) support for regional cooperation among the countries of Northeast \nAsia to combat dust and sandstorms. The TA will contribute to the implementation of the \nregional master plan that was prepared under TA on Prevention and Control of Dust and \nSandstorms  in  Northeast  Asia.2  In  January  and  February  2010,  ADB  missions  visited  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  Mongolia,  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the \ngovernments  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Dust and sandstorms are the end products of desertification, which has become a \nregional  environmental  (ecosystem  degradation)  problem  in  grasslands  in  Northeast  Asia.3 \nGrasslands constitute about 40% of land area in the PRC and 80% in Mongolia. Inappropriate \ngrassland management practices and development policies have led to degradation and the \nbreakdown of traditional resource management systems. Conversion to cultivated crops and \novergrazing through changes in the number, type, and movement of livestock have reduced \nland cover, biodiversity, and soil fertility. Moreover, grasslands are vulnerable to the impacts of \nclimate change, including more frequent droughts, and shortage of water and forage.  \n \n3.  Ecosystem degradation has caused a steady increase in the annual number of dust and \nsandstorms in Northeast Asia. The environmental, economic, and social consequences for the \nrural population in Northeast Asia are serious and include the destruction of farmland; loss of \nlivestock;  and  damage  to  houses,  settlements,  and  community  infrastructure.  Dust  and \nsandstorms have also disrupted power supplies, telecommunications, and transport services, \nwhile poor air quality has led to more health problems. The same events have also reduced air \nquality in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, and dust particles originating from the PRC and \nMongolia have reached as far as the west coast of North America. \n \n4.  Over the last 20 years, the PRC and Mongolia have developed new environmental \npolicies and implemented investment programs to address the problems of land degradation. \nRecognizing that dust and sandstorms have regional impacts, the governments of the PRC and \nMongolia collaborated in the development of a regional master plan for the prevention and \ncontrol of such events in Northeast Asia.4 The master plan was developed in association with \nJapan and the Republic of Korea, and supported by ADB, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and \nthe United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Secretariat. \n \n5.  Improvement of grassland management practices and the development of sustainable \nfinancing mechanisms are among the key actions proposed in the regional master plan. While \nthere are many studies and programs to improve grassland management practices, to date \nthere are only few projects that (i) monitor soil carbon sequestration, (ii) demonstrate the value \n                                                 \n1  The  TA  first  appeared  in  the  business  opportunities  section  of  ADB's  website  on  22  February  2010  as \nStrengthening Regional Grassland Management to Reduce Dust and Sandstorms in Northeast Asia.  \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance on Prevention and Control of Dust and Sandstorms in Northeast Asia. Manila \n(TA 6068-REG, $1,000,000, approved on 11 December, financed by Japan Special Fund and GEF). \n3  The term \"grasslands\" is intended to include rangelands, grazing lands, agro-silvo pastoral systems (a combination \nof trees or shrubs with crops and animal husbandry), and cultivated pastures. \n4  The master plan was developed under ADB TA 6068-REG (footnote 2).  \n ", "2   \n(as an environmental service) of helping reduce dust and sandstorms, and (iii) support local \ncommunities in adapting to climate impacts. Recent research shows that more sustainable \nmanagement practices can significantly increase carbon stocks in the degraded grasslands.5 \nReported  carbon  sequestration  potential  for  grassland  management  practices  includes \nvegetation  cultivation  (9.39  tons  [t]  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  per  hectare  per  year \n[CO e/ha/year]),  land-use  change  (0.40t  CO e/ha/year),  grazing  management  (2.16t \n2 2\nCO e/ha/year),  fertilizer  management  (1.76t  CO e/ha/year),  and  fire  control  (2.68t \n2 2\nCO e/ha/year). Considering that current voluntary emission reductions are traded at prices \n2\nbetween $2 and $10 per t CO e/ha/year,6 depending on the applied verification standards, \n2\nsequestration opportunities in grasslands could benefit local communities. \n \n6.  The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s core area of operations under Strategy 20207 and its \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Strategy (2006).8 It is also in line with the efforts of the \nPRC  and  Mongolia  to  strengthen  sustainable  development  and  reverse  environmental \ndegradation at the national levels.9   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will help reduce the occurrence of dust and sandstorms in Northeast Asia. It will \nhelp reduce infrastructure damage and public health issues resulting from these events for \nmillions of people, particularly the poor, in the participating countries. Specifically, the TA will \nstrengthen the capacity of the governments of the PRC and Mongolia to support communities in \naccessing carbon financing by applying sustainable grassland management practices. It will \nprovide  the  necessary  methodologies,  tools,  and  studies  to  introduce  sustainable  carbon \nfinancing  mechanisms  for  grassland  management  projects  in  the  PRC  and  Mongolia.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will deliver the following outputs:  \n \n(i)  Review of financing mechanisms for sustainable grassland management. A \nstudy on financing sustainable grassland management will (a) review the current \npolicy and regulatory framework for grassland management in Northeast Asia, \n(b) estimate the economic value of the grasslands, (c) identify the link between \nconditions of grasslands and occurrence of dust and sandstorms, (d) review \nregional data-monitoring and information-sharing arrangements regarding land \ndegradation  and  carbon  stocks,  and  (e)  prepare  recommendations  on \nopportunities to access international and local carbon markets. The findings of \nthe study will be discussed and disseminated through a regional workshop, and \nthrough  the  publication  of  a  report  on  potential  financing  mechanisms  for \n                                                 \n5  Drylands in East Asia region contain an estimated 33% of the total carbon stocks. \n6  January 2010 prices. \n7  ADB. 2008.

A  study  tour  will  be  conducted  to  gain \npractical experience from similar initiatives outside of Northeast Asia.  \n \n(ii)  Field assessments on carbon sequestration potential and monitoring of \ngrasslands. Selected field studies will be conducted to determine and confirm \nthe potential for carbon sequestration in grasslands, such as (a) establish soil \ncarbon  baselines  at  eight  demonstration  sites;  (b)  establish  quantitative \nestimates  of  carbon  sinks,  according  to  representative  types  and  state  of \ndegraded grasslands; (c) develop methodological guidelines for assessing and \nmonitoring soil carbon, including establishing a practical approach to extrapolate \nfield sampling data;10 (d) design a network to monitor carbon sequestration, and \ndust  and  sandstorms  at  the  demonstration  sites;  and  (e)  determine \nmethodologies for establishing baselines, measuring, and monitoring, reporting, \nand verifying sequestered CO . Building on the initial achievement of ADB TA on \n2\nPrevention and Control of Dust and Sandstorms in Northeast Asia (footnote 2), \nthe TA will also further enhance regional cooperation on monitoring and data \nsharing, and establish cooperation mechanisms to supplement ongoing regional \nand national initiatives for soil carbon and land degradation monitoring. The \nfindings of the study will be discussed and disseminated through a regional \nworkshop, and the publication of a final report on carbon sequestration potential \nand monitoring of grasslands in Northeast Asia. \n \n(iii)  Heightened awareness of carbon financing opportunities for sustainable \ngrassland  management.  The  TA  will  support  the  local  communities  and \ngovernments  at  the  eight  demonstration  sites  in  determining  and  adopting \ngrassland management practices that may be eligible for carbon financing. The \nTA will (a) review international experiences with payment for ecological services \nand land tenure, including in Northeast Asia; (b) consult beneficiaries at the eight \ndemonstration sites to identify opportunities for carbon financing through better \ngrassland management practices; (c) assess opportunities for and barriers to \ncommunity participation in accessing voluntary carbon markets (adaptation and \nmitigation); (d) identify institutional arrangements to maximize ownership by the \nbeneficiaries  of  the  potential  projects;  (e)  draft  methodologies  for  preparing \ncommunity agreements for accessing carbon financing through voluntary carbon \nmarkets; and (f) prepare training materials to raise awareness of the grassland \nsequestration  potential.  The  findings  of  the  study  will  be  discussed  and \ndisseminated through a regional workshop, and the publication of a final report \non the approaches to community participation in voluntary carbon markets for \nmore sustainable grassland management in Northeast Asia. \n \n(iv)  Development  of  terrestrial  carbon  financing  opportunities  for  Northeast \nAsia. Based on the field assessment and the identified potential for soil carbon \nsequestration, the TA will support the governments of the PRC and Mongolia in \nformulating project proposals that will be eligible for financing through possible \npost-201211  adaptation  or  mitigation  carbon  markets  or  funds.  The  activities \ninclude  (a)  reviewing  possible  post-2012  regional  and  international  carbon \n                                                 \n10  Standard low-cost soil carbon measurements are easy to conduct, but reliable extrapolation standards for boosting \ncarbon stocks are still being developed.  \n11  Post-2012 refers to the time when the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008\u20132012) expires. \nAgreements for subsequent commitment periods under the Kyoto Protocol are still being negotiated.  \n ", "4   \nmarket  mechanisms;  (b)  assessing  opportunities  for  carbon  financing  for \ngrassland sequestration, particularly among the voluntary carbon markets (e.g., \nthe Chicago Carbon Exchange or regional voluntary markets); (c) preparing at \nleast two project proposals for carbon financing; and (d) initiating discussions \nwith  the  potential  financiers.  A  regional  workshop  will  be  organized  to \ndisseminate the final TA report. \n \n(v)  Project management and support. The TA will provide overall support for the \nimplementation of the project activities specified for each component, and ensure \nthat project outcomes and outputs are delivered on time and with the expected \nquality. The outputs will include all project-related reports and workshops.  \n \n9.  Eight demonstration sites12 were identified during the implementation of ADB TA on \nPrevention and Control of Dust and Sandstorms in Northeast Asia (footnote 2). The sites, all \nsource  areas  of  dust  and  sandstorms,  were  selected  because  they  represent  different \necosystems with an array of land uses, population densities, and poor ecological conditions. \nFurther details on the feasibility of working in these demonstration sites will be discussed with \nthe consultants and national experts during the inception phase. The key considerations will be \n(i) the potential of the degraded grasslands to sequester carbon, and (ii) the capacity for low-\ncost soil carbon measurements that will establish reliable baseline conditions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,800,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $1,000,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility and $400,000 equivalent \non  a  grant  basis  from  the  People's  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty \nReduction  Fund,  administered  by  ADB.13  The  governments  of  the  PRC  and  Mongolia  will \nfinance the remaining $400,000 equivalent in kind to cover counterpart costs and services \nincluding  office  accommodation,  data  processing  and  preparation,  and  remuneration  of \ncounterpart staff. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented from July 2010 to June 2012. ADB will be the executing \nagency  for  the  TA.  In  the  PRC,  the  implementing  agency  will  be  the  Foreign  Economic \nCooperation Center of the Ministry of Agriculture. Guided by the ministry\u2019s Department for \nInternational Cooperation, the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center will closely cooperate with \nthe PRC's Center of Grassland Supervision and Monitoring. A national technical working group \nwill be established with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, \nthe State Forestry Administration, and the Ministry of Environmental Protection. In Mongolia, the \nDepartment of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Nature, Environment, and Tourism \nwill be the implementing agency. A national technical working group will involve experts from the \nDepartment of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry; \n                                                 \n12 These consist of four sites in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the PRC (Alashan, Hulunbuir, Ordos \nPlateau, and Xilingol) and four sites in the southern part of Mongolia (Dornogobi, Omnogobi, Ovorhangai, and \nSukhbaatar). \n13  Partial funding was secured from the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund in 2005. Proposed cofinancing from the GEF never materialized. A revised scope of the TA suitable for \nfinancing by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund was prepared in consultation with the governments of \nthe PRC and Mongolia. ", "  5\nthe Ministry of Finance; the National Agency for Meteorology and Environment Monitoring; and \nthe National Committee for Climate Change.  \n \n12.  Both national working groups will ensure close coordination and cooperation with the \nnational focal points for the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the United \nNations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  and  other  relevant  stakeholders.  The \nnational focal points will be invited to join the national technical working groups, and discussions \nwill be held among the stakeholders on efficient information and data-sharing arrangements, \nboth  nationally  and  regionally.  Notably,  the  ongoing  programs  of  the  National  Agency  for \nMeteorology  and  Environment  Monitoring  in  Mongolia  and  the  Ministry  of  Environmental \nProtection in the PRC will contribute to the work at the demonstration sites.  \n \n13.  A team of individual consultants will be recruited for a total of 114 person-months, \ncomprising three international experts for 18 person-months and eight national experts for 96 \nperson-months.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  using  the  individual  selection  method  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Individual consultant engagements are considered as more efficient for the TA as they will \nallow quality control in the selection and management of the national experts, and consultants \ncan  be  mobilized  more  rapidly.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  of  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. The international consultants will distribute their inputs equally between the PRC \nand Mongolia to work directly with the respective implementing agencies. The implementing \nagencies will handle the procurement of equipment under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Ownership of the equipment will \nbe transferred to the implementing agencies upon TA completion. Disbursement under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.14 \n \n14.  Implementation progress will be monitored through (i) inception, interim, and final TA \nreview missions; (ii) regional workshops; and (iii) TA reports and technical publications. The \nschedule for the regional workshops and TA reports is in the design and monitoring framework. \nThe main reports will be prepared in Chinese, English, and Mongolian languages. The findings \nwill be disseminated through workshops, conferences, and a TA website. The outputs of the TA \nwill also be made available on websites of ADB and the implementing agencies.  \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 \non a grant basis for Strengthening Carbon Financing for Regional Grassland Management in \nNortheast Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2008.
