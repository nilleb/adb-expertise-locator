The  12th  summit  meeting  of  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation \n(SAARC), held on 4\u20136 January 2004 in Islamabad, has opened new avenues of regional \ncooperation  among  the  South  Asian  countries.  The  Islamabad  Declaration1 reaffirms  the \n\u201ccentrality of SAARC for promoting regional cooperation\u201d and emphasizes the need to increase \nits efficiency and effectiveness. The Islamabad Declaration identified several priority areas of \npotential  cooperation  among  the  SAARC  countries.  In  view  of  the  improved  prospects  for \nregional cooperation in South Asia, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the SAARC Secretariat \nstarted  the  discussion  for  mutual  cooperation  to  this  end,  and  signed  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding on 12 April 2004. In parallel, ADB and the SAARC Secretariat discussed possible \nADB assistance to assess regional cooperation prospects in South Asia, and to identify specific \nprograms and projects that will foster closer economic linkages between the SAARC member \ncountries. A fact-finding mission visited Kathmandu from 31 March to 2 April 2004, followed by a \nconsultation mission from 1 to 3 June 2004, and held discussions with the Secretary General \nand other senior officials of the SAARC Secretariat to determine the scope and implementation \narrangements of the proposed subregional technical assistance (TA).2 Appendix 1 provides the \nTA framework. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \n2.  ADB is mandated by its Charter to foster regional cooperation in the Asia and Pacific \nRegion and contribute to the acceleration of economic development. ADB has considerable \nexperience in promoting subregional and regional cooperation initiatives, including the Greater \nMekong Subregion program, Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation, and South Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC). ADB\u2019s experience in promoting subregional and \nregional cooperation has differed across regions because of varying sociological, political, and \neconomic factors. The main lessons learned are that subregional and regional cooperation \ninitiatives result in better allocation and use of resources through trade liberalization, better \nconnectivity and knowledge sharing, and creation of opportunities for an increased level of \nproductive  investments.  Subregional  and  regional  cooperation  also  enhances  social \ndevelopment  by  facilitating  joint  delivery  of  essential  public  services  and  by  reducing  the \nnegative externalities, particularly through reducing conflicts. Improved understanding and trust \nthrough cooperation can also contribute to peace and stability in the region. Such opportunities \nfor regional cooperation and potential benefits to be gained from cooperation also exist in the \nwhole Asia and Pacific Region, and important lessons on effective and efficient implementation \nof  cooperative  activities  may  be  learned  from  other  subregional  and  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives.  \n \n3.  SAARC was formed in 1985 by the heads of states of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the \nMaldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, to promote collaboration and mutual assistance in \neconomic, social, cultural, technical, and scientific fields, and to strengthen cooperation among \nthe  member  states  in  international  forums  on  matters  of  common  interest.  The  SAARC \nSecretariat  is  in  Kathmandu,  Nepal,  and  eight  sector/theme-specific  SAARC  centers  are \ndistributed in the SAARC member states.3 \n                                                 \n1  The Islamabad Declaration was signed at the Twelfth SAARC Summit held on 4\u20136 January 2004 in Islamabad, \nPakistan.   \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 30 July 2004. \n3  These  include  centers  for  agricultural  information  (Dhaka);  meteorological  research  (Dhaka);  tuberculosis \n(Kathmandu); documentation (New Delhi); human resource development (Islamabad); culture (Kandy); coastal \nzone management (Mal\u00e9); and information (Kathmandu). The establishment of the latter three centers has been \napproved but yet to be done. ", "2  \n4.  Owing to recent history between some member states as well as wide ranging diversity \nin the region in terms of size of countries and level of development, SAARC has not made \nsignificant progress in implementing a cooperation agenda on economic issues. As a result, \nSAARC\u2019s  intraregional  trade  as  a  proportion  of  total  trade  has  remained  small  and  has \nincreased marginally from 3.0% in 1985 to 4.2% in 2002. Intraregional investment flows were \nalso insignificant, and regional economies have not been able to reap any substantial benefits of \nregional cooperation.  \n \n5.  Given the unsupportive political and economic conditions in South Asia for pursuing \nregional cooperation agenda, ADB has been taking project-based and subregional approaches \nbased on mutual economic interests and political will to work together among participating \ncountries.  Thus,  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  SASEC  program,  involving  four  SAARC \ncountries\u2014Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. The four countries are grouped under the \nSouth  Asian  Growth  Quadrangle  (SAGQ)  initiative,  which  identified  five  priority  sectors  for \ncooperation: transport, energy, environment, tourism, and trade and investment, and requested \nADB assistance. ADB approved TAs 5936 (SASEC phases I)4 and 6010 (SASEC phase II) 5 to \nassist  the  participating  countries  in  (i)  identifying  and  prioritizing  subregional  projects;  (ii) \ndeveloping action programs; and (iii) preparing a needs assessment, including human resource \ndevelopment, for implementing the action program in the five priority sectors. Information and \ncommunication technology was added as the sixth priority sector under the SASEC phase II TA. \n \n6.  Following a successful ADB-organized ministerial conference in mid-2003 to promote \ntransport, transit, and trade by exploring the feasibility of using the two corridors connecting \nland-locked Central Asian countries to the sea ports of South Asia via Afghanistan,6 and based \non the findings and recommendations of small-scale technical assistance, provided separately \nto Afghanistan and Pakistan in early 2003, ADB approved TA 6156 the Subregional Economic \nCooperation in South and Central Asia (SECSCA).7 ADB also approved two TA grants to \nconduct  technical  feasibility  studies  of  the  Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan  Natural  Gas \nPipeline  Project.8 In  addition,  other  subregional  cooperation  initiatives  are  being  explored \nthrough two separate small-scale TAs, for the Maldives and Sri Lanka. \n \n7.  The  renewed  commitment  to  SAARC  from  all  its  member  states  could  make  the \nIslamabad  Declaration  a  watershed  in  regional  cooperation  in  South  Asia.  The  Islamabad \nDeclaration  highlights  the  scope  for  enhancing  regional  cooperation  in  poverty  alleviation \nstrategies (based on the SAARC Social Charter, which was also adopted at the 12th SAARC \nsummit), energy, transport, trade and investment, transit, communication, tourism, creation of a \nregional  food  bank,  human  development,  water  sharing,  and  environment.  The  Islamabad \nDeclaration  also  emphasizes  measures  to  combat  terrorism,  and  development  of  mutually \nbeneficial  links  between  SAARC  and  other  regional  and  international  organizations.  A \nframework agreement for implementing the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) was \nalso signed during the summit. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2000.

ADB can play a strong supportive and catalytic role assisting SAARC to realize some of \nthe major regional cooperation agendas of the Islamabad Declaration, particularly in the areas \nwhere greater strategic impact is expected and ADB has comparative strengths and substantial \nexperience. While this TA will build and extend on the work already undertaken with ADB \nsupport, such as the SASEC and SECSCA programs, these ongoing project-based subregional \ninitiatives will be maintained.   \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The objectives of the TA are to (i) assist the SAARC Secretariat, including its eight \nsector/theme-specific centers, to implement the regional cooperation activities effectively in the \nselected priority areas, as outlined in the Islamabad Declaration; (ii) enhance the capacity of the \nSAARC Secretariat, its centers, and government entities of the member states for effective \nplanning, processing, and implementation of the key regional cooperation agenda; and (iii) \nsupport collaborative activities to strengthen cooperation between SAARC and the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other regional organizations.  \n \n10.  The main outputs of the TA are (i) a road map to improve regional connectivity through \nmajor modes of transport to facilitate the movements of goods and people,9 (ii) enhanced \ncapacity  of  the  SAARC  organizations  and  its  member  states  in  carrying  out  cooperation \nactivities in the priority areas, and (iii) strengthened cooperation between SAARC and other \nregional organizations.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will include four components: \n \n(i)  SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study. The study will  \n(a)  analyze the current constraints and challenges, and potential benefits of \nimproved regional transport connectivity through several transport modes; \nand \n(b)  prepare a road map for enhancing regional connectivity, and develop a \ntime-bound investment action plan with possible external assistance. \n \n(ii)  Capacity building. This component will \n(a)  assist the SAARC organizations and its members\u2019 government entities in \ncapacity building and human resource development in the priority areas \nand sectors identified in the Islamabad Declaration, and to be agreed with \nADB; and \n(b)  emphasize training of the trainers using SAARC centers.  \n \n(iii)  Conferences,  workshops,  and  seminars.  This  component  will  entail \nconducting conferences, workshops, and seminars in the priority areas, including \nactivities  related  to  exploring  the  possibilities  for  SAARC  cooperation  with \nASEAN and other regional organizations. \n                                                 \n9  Out of several areas for cooperation included in the Islamabad Declaration, the SAARC Secretariat has obtained \nan endorsement, from the SAARC Standing Committee, only for carrying out a regional multimodal transport study \nand capacity-building activities in the priority areas. The studies in other priority areas will be considered in the later \nstage of ADB-SAARC cooperation based on the memorandum of understanding signed by the two institutions.  \n ", "4  \n \n(iv)  Logistics services and support. This component will, with the assistance of \nexperienced  consultants  based  at  ADB\u2019s  headquarters  and  Nepal  Resident \nMission,  assist  the  SAARC  Secretariat  to  implement  the  TA  activities  and \nproduce outputs effectively and efficiently. \n \n12.  In view of the broad range of commitments made at the recent SAARC summit in \nIslamabad, and because any activities to be covered by the TA require all SAARC member \nstates\u2019 unanimous endorsement, the TA will take a \u201cprocess approach\u201d by which some activities, \nsuch as training and convening conferences, will be determined during TA implementation. For \nthis purpose, the SAARC Secretariat and ADB will determine the milestones for implementing \nsuch specific activities at the TA inception and later stages.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing  \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The SAARC Secretariat and SAARC member states will make \nin-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over a 16-month period beginning in October 2004. Of the \nfour  components  under  the  TA,  the  following  three  will  be  implemented  by  the  SAARC \nSecretariat and/or the SAARC centers under ADB\u2019s overall supervision (i) SAARC Regional \nMultimodal Transport Study (SRMTS); (ii) capacity building; and (iii) conferences, workshops, \nand seminars. The logistics services and support component will be done by ADB in close \ncoordination with the SAARC Secretariat.  \n \n15.  Within ADB, an ADB TA team will be established, comprising staff of the South Asia \nOperations and Coordination Division, South Asia Transport and Communications Division, \nNepal Resident Mission, and consultants, as well as other ADB divisions and other resident \nmissions as appropriate. The South Asia Operations Coordination Division will be responsible \nfor overall TA implementation and maintain close coordination with the SAARC Secretariat and \nwithin ADB, while the South Asia Transport and Communications Division will take a lead role \nfor monitoring and overseeing the SRMTS. \n \n16.  The three components to be implemented by the SAARC Secretariat will be carried out \nunder  the  overall  guidance  of  the  SAARC  Standing  Committee  comprising  seven  foreign \nsecretaries  of  the  SAARC  member  states.  The  SAARC  Secretariat  will  coordinate  and \ncommunicate with the Standing Committee, the governments concerned, and all stakeholders \ninvolved in the TA implementation, and keep in close touch with ADB. \n \n17.  The SRMTS will be implemented in two phases: phase I\u2014national transport sector \nreviews; and phase II\u2014road map for regional connectivity. The SRMTS will be undertaken by a \nteam of consultants comprising national sector experts and regional sector experts (domestic \nconsultants) to be engaged for 24 person-months and 9 person-months, respectively (a total of \n33 person-months).  \n \n18.  The SRMTS will use, as inputs, a background paper, a review of SAARC Regional \nTransport Connectivity, which is being prepared by ADB. The background paper includes the \ndetailed scope and terms of reference of the SRMTS for discussion and final determination at \n ", "  5\nthe inception workshop10 scheduled within 2004. The workshop will provide recommendations \nand clear direction for the SRMTS to be conducted by national and regional sector experts. In \neach SAARC country,  a national TA team will be established, comprising the staff of the \nrelevant  agencies  and  national  sector  experts.  The  national  sector  experts  will  prepare \nindividual country studies. The regional sector experts, who are eminent transport specialists to \nbe recruited from the SAARC countries and who have access to individual countries\u2019 data and \ninformation, will synthesize the individual country studies, prepare a draft report from regional \nperspectives for discussion at the second workshop, and finalize the SRMTS incorporating \ncomments.  The  consultants\u2019  team  will  work  under  the  overall  supervision  of  the  SAARC \nSecretariat and the guidance of the ADB TA team. The SAARC Secretariat and the ADB TA \nteam will meet, as necessary, to assess the progress of work. The SAARC Secretariat will \nconsult,  coordinate,  and  communicate  with  the  concerned  governments  and  the  SAARC \nTechnical Committee on Transport,11 when appropriate. The final report will be submitted to the \nStanding Committee for its endorsement.   \n \n19.  The capacity-building programs will be implemented as agreed between the SAARC \nSecretariat and ADB, using existing SAARC centers and other facilities as appropriate. The \ndetails  of  capacity-strengthening  needs  will  be  identified  by  the  SAARC  Secretariat  in \nconsultation with its member states before and during TA implementation. Emphasis will be \nplaced  on  the  training  of  trainers  in  the  priority  sectors/areas  included  in  the  Islamabad \nDeclaration. To this end, the SAARC Secretariat will submit the capacity-building programs for \nADB review and concurrence.  \n \n20.  As ADB TA team members, a senior sector advisor (international consultant) for quality \ncontrol of the SRMTS and a program analyst (domestic consultant) providing logistics services \nto all activities under the TA will be recruited for 1.5 and 14 person-months, respectively. In \naddition, Nepal Resident Mission will be staffed by a TA implementation advisor (domestic \nconsultant)  for  16  months,  for  coordinating  with  the  SAARC  Secretariat  and  assisting  TA \nimplementation.  An  organization  chart  on  the  proposed  implementation  arrangements  is \npresented in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.  All consultants and experts under the TA will be engaged as individual consultants in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nacceptable to ADB for the engagement of the domestic consultants. The outline of the terms of \nreference for the consultants is given in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nPromoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                 \n10 To be attended by the SAARC Secretariat; the representatives of member states, including government officials \nand transport sector experts; and the ADB TA team. \n11 A technical committee on transport comprises senior officials of the line ministries of the SAARC member states \nand meets on an ad hoc basis to discuss regional and technical issues related to transport sector.  \n  \n ", "6           Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Monitoring   Assumption  \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanism  and Risks \n     \nGoal  \n   \nEffective cooperation among  Implementation of  Reports by the SAARC \nall South Asian countries,  cooperation activities,  Secretariat. \nenabled by the South Asian  including projects and   \nAssociation for Regional  training, through a SAARC  SAARC Standing \nCooperation (SAARC), helps  framework.

Under the technical assistance (TA), consultants, mostly domestic consultants, will be \nrecruited  for  two  components:  (i)  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation \n(SAARC) Regional Multimodal Transport Study (SRMTS); and (ii) logistics services and support. \n \nA.  Regional Transport Study  \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n2.  The  main  objective  of  the  SRMTS  is  to  prepare  a  road  map  to  improve  regional \nconnectivity through the major modes of transport (road, rail, seaports, inland waterways, and \ncivil aviation) to facilitate trade and travel among SAARC member states. The road map will \nexplore the possible ways for establishing better connectivity between key political/economic \ncenters of SAARC member states so as to promote intraregional movements of goods, services, \nand people. The SRMTS will identify the major physical, institutional\u2013nonphysical constraints \nhindering the smooth movement of goods and people between the SAARC member states and \nrecommend an integrated and multimodal approach to overcome these constraints to enhance \nregional connectivity. The SRMTS will augment outputs under ongoing ADB assistance to \nsubregional cooperation among the SAARC member states. \n \n2.  Scope of the Study \n \n3.  The SRMTS will be implemented in two phases. Phase I\u2014national transport sector \nreviews\u2014will  be  conducted  in  each  SAARC  country  and  will  entail  detailed  analysis  of \nsubregional and regional corridors that would connect key locations and economic centers of \nthe SAARC countries and neighboring countries in an efficient manner. The number of corridors \nwill be limited to those connecting country capitals or key economic centers so as to create \nmaximum impact for the improvement. Parallel exercises will be carried out for identifying  \n(i) areas for which capacity-building activities and/or reforms are needed, (ii) projects that will \nyield quick and visible impacts, and (iii) options for conducting empirical studies on the poverty \nreduction impact. \n \n4.  Phase  II\u2014road  map  for  regional  connectivity\u2014will  look  into  specific  proposals  for \nestablishing  improved  multimodal  transport  links  in  the  region  and  develop  a  time-bound \ninvestment action plan with possible external assistance. In identifying viable links based on \nassessments of physical, financial, and institutional factors of the individual projects and their \nlinking,  the  phase  II  study  will  also  identify  associated  safeguard  issues  that  need  to  be \naddressed, including measures to prevent or minimize risks of air pollution and HIV/AIDS,1 \nhuman trafficking, and money laundering. In addition, proposals for improving transport links \nshould, where possible and appropriate, distinguish national and regional components. Regional \ncomponents could be considered for financing from the regional indicative planning figures of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n   3.  Areas of Focus \n \n5.  To  establish  reliable,  effective,  efficient,  and  fully  integrated  multimodal  transport \nconnectivity between the SAARC member states, the SRMTS will focus on the following specific \naspects. \n                                                 \n1 HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "12           Appendix 4 \n \n(i)  Roads, rail and inland water transport subsectors. The SRMTS will identify \nkey  regional  corridors  and  major  border  points/gateways,  and  assess  the \nphysical  and  nonphysical  (documentation,  procedures,  and  institutional) \nconstraints  to  smooth  movement  of  goods  and  people  between  the  SAARC \nmember states, by road, rail, and inland water, or a combination of these modes. \n \n(ii)  Land ports. The SRMTS will identify the land ports, which will act as the major \ngateways for overland traffic movement between the SAARC member states, \nwhich would need to be upgraded and expanded. The SRMTS will also assess \nthe physical and nonphysical (documentation, procedures, etc.) constraints. \n \n(iii)  Civil aviation. The SRMTS will identify key air routes to be connected, examine \nthe  current  civil  aviation  operations,  assess  the  physical  and  institutional \nconstraints to the smooth movement of freight and passengers between the \nSAARC member states, and identify possible routes to be served by scheduled \nor charter flights. \n \n(iv)  Ports and shipping. The SRMTS will (i) identify the key shipping routes and \ntheir  connection  with  major  seaports  in  South  Asia,  including  those  in  the \nMaldives and Sri Lanka, and their connectivity with major trading partner cities in \nSouth Asia; (ii) assess the adequacy of the current port facilities and level of their \nefficiency; and (iii) examine the adequacy of current shipping operations, and \nassess the physical and institutional constraints at the sea ports to the efficient \nmovement of freight and (where applicable) passengers, between the SAARC \nmember states. \n \n4.  Scope of work \n \n6.  The SRMTS will be carried out by a team of national sector experts and regional sector \nexperts. By the time the SRMTS commences, ADB will prepare a background paper with \ndetailed  scope  of  work  and  terms  of  references  for  both  phases  of  the  SRMTS.2 The \nbackground paper will be discussed and finally determined at the inception workshop to be held \nwithin 2004, which will be attended by the representatives of the SAARC Secretariat and its \nmember states, transport experts from South Asia region, and the ADB TA team. The work of \nnational sector experts and regional sector experts may include but not limited to the following. \n \na.  National Sector Experts (domestic, 24 person-months) \n \n7.  National sector experts of each of seven SAARC member states will be engaged for a \nnational transport sector review, based on the terms of reference to be prepared by ADB and \nagreed at the inception workshop. The total inputs of the experts will be 24 person-months but \ntheir engagement will vary from one country to another depending on the existing or planned \n                                                 \n2  ADB (South Asia Operations Coordination Division, South Asia Transport and Communications Division, and staff \nconsultants) will prepare, using its own resources, a background paper on SAARC regional transport connectivity \nreview. The paper includes the examination of major transport modes in South Asia from regional connectivity \nviewpoint. The paper will also identify major institutional and physical constraints hindering movement of goods \nand people among the SAARC member states; draw from other completed studies and projects, and recommend \nan integrated and multimodal approach to overcome these obstacles to enhance regional connectivity. The paper \nwill include detailed scope and terms of reference for the work conducted under TA.
