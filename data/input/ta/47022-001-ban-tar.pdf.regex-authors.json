The  proposed  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  consistent  with  the \nSouth  Asia  regional  cooperation  strategy,  2011\u201320151 and  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) country partnership strategy for Bangladesh,2 both of which place high priority  on \nregional  connectivity  and  trade  facilitation  projects.  The  TA  was  conceptualized  following \nconsultations conducted for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) trade \nfacilitation from October 2012 to March 2013, and was included in ADB\u2019s South Asia regional \ncooperation operations business plan, 2013-2015.3 \n \n2.  At the meetings of the SASEC trade facilitation and transport working group (TFTWG) in \n2010\u20132012, the governments of SASEC countries4 requested continued support from ADB on \nSASEC  trade  facilitation.  At  the  SASEC  TFTWG  meeting  held  in  Thimphu,  Bhutan  on  8 \nNovember  2012,  SASEC  country  delegations  (i)  agreed  to  expand  assistance  to  trade \nfacilitation through additional TA to ensure that full support is provided to ongoing initiatives, and \n(ii)  requested  ADB  to  explore  the  possibility  of  providing  TA  to  respond  to  specific  trade \nfacilitation needs of SASEC countries. \n \n3.  An ADB mission visited Dhaka in January 2013 to discuss with the Government of \nBangladesh the assistance required with regard to the participation of Bangladesh in SASEC \ntrade  facilitation  initiatives,  including  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  and  activities  of  the \nproposed TA. Subsequent consultations with the government resulted in agreement on the TA\u2019s \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. At the \nSASEC customs subgroup meeting in Bangkok in March 2013, representatives of SASEC \ncountries, ADB, and the World Customs Organization (WCO) discussed priority training needs \nto  support  customs  modernization  efforts  in  SASEC  member  countries.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1.5  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The Doing Business Report 20136 by the World Bank estimates that it takes 25 days in \nBangladesh to complete all procedures related to export and 34 days for import. Costs of \ntransporting a 20-foot container average $1,025 for export and $1,430 for import. High costs \nand time to trade greatly reduce prospects for trade in Bangladesh and rank the country 119 on \nefficiency in trading across borders. Data indicate that a significant portion of the time needed to \ntrade is due to institutional barriers, such as the time taken to prepare documentation and \ncomplete customs clearance. \n  \n5.  Need to facilitate border clearance. The government needs to put in place the legal \nand regulatory framework to facilitate border formalities. The accession of Bangladesh to the \nRevised Kyoto Convention (RKC) 7 in September 2012 is an important first step in this direction. \nWith the assistance of the WCO, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) of Bangladesh has \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n4  Comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 May 2013. \n6   The World Bank and IFC. 2013. Doing Business 2013. Washington.  \n7  The RKC, or the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (as \namended), came into force in 1999 and represents the most widely accepted blueprint for modern customs \noperations. \n ", "2   \nfinalized a strategic plan of action for customs for 2013\u20132016, which lists high-priority actions \nincluding modernizing and automating customs procedures, applying risk management tools, \nand developing a national single window in line with the RKC. Many of the required policy \nactions to implement the RKC and the strategic action plan for customs are included as tranche \nconditions under the ADB-assisted SASEC Trade Facilitation Program loan in Bangladesh.8 \nInitial  experience  in  implementing  the  Program  loan  suggests  that  the  government  needs \nassistance in ensuring that these tranche conditions are satisfied, and in putting in place the \nother  key  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  and  capacity  requirements  for  customs \nmodernization and reforms in Bangladesh.9 \n \n6.  The large volume of required documentation is a major impediment to the smooth flow of \ngoods across borders. A large number of documents, multiple copies, and multiple signatures \nare required to undertake customs clearance. For example, exporting a standard container of \ngoods requires six documents, while importing the same container of goods requires eight \ndocuments.10 Alignment of trade documents with international standards and harmonization of \ndocuments across agencies and/or ministries and across countries will reduce the burden on \ntraders. \n \n7.  The absence of a structured risk management regime is another major impediment. \nAlthough about 10% of cargo needs to be inspected at the borders, inspection is mainly at the \ndiscretion of the senior management at customs stations. Risk-managed inspection on the basis \nof carefully drawn risk profiling is still absent. As a result, highly compliant traders are denied \nfacilitation measures, such as pre-arrival clearance, post-clearance audit, and other methods for \nnonintrusive inspections. Valuation of goods is another major source of dispute at borders, \nwhich leads to goods being detained for a long time. \n \n8.  Lack of full customs automation. Bangladesh currently uses the Automated System \nfor Customs Data (ASYCUDA)++ for the operation of customs. To date three ports\u2014 Benapole, \nChittagong,  and  Dhaka\u2014have  been  automated  through  the  adoption  of  ASYCUDA++.  In \npractice,  however,  automation  is  partial  at  best,  with  several  key  functions  still  conducted \nmanually  and,  therefore,  with  low  levels  of  efficiency.  Procedures  in  all  other  ports  are \nconducted manually. This is followed by entry of ex-post data, which are collected on CD-ROMs \nand sent to the central customs office in Dhaka at the end of each month. This is an inefficient \nand  outdated  method  of  customs  data  management.  Under  the  present  system,  customs \nofficers are unable to interface with the other border agencies, such as quarantine, immigration, \nand  the  Bangladesh  Land  Port  Authority,  which  use  other  systems. There  is  also  lack of \nconnectivity with banks, freight forwarders, and importers and exporters. There is no pre-arrival \ndeclaration  or  advance  ruling  facility.  However,  Bangladesh  is  migrating  its  customs \nmanagement  system  from  ASYCUDA++  to  ASYCUDA  World.  This  new  system  will  allow \nelectronic data interchange system across customs stations and border agencies, an electronic \nnational single window (NSW), and other e-customs facilities.  \n \n9.  Need for enhanced trader access to information. One of the ongoing initiatives that \nthe government is undertaking to promote accelerated trade and investment is to make key \ninformation on trade regulations and procedures easily available to the trading community. With \ninitiative from the Ministry of Commerce, Bangladesh is in the process of developing a trade \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n9  A similar situation was observed in Bhutan and Nepal, which were also recipients of the SASEC Trade Facilitation \nProgram loans and grants. CDTA support is also being planned for Bhutan and Nepal. \n10 World Bank. 2012. Doing Business 2012.

Private sector \nrepresentatives in Bangladesh, including chambers of commerce, are also working actively to \nprovide information to businesses, including on market access and bank and other finance \nopportunities. The government has requested ADB\u2019s support in providing timely and relevant \ninformation to traders. \n \n10.  Bangladesh has made significant efforts to implement trade facilitation measures. With \nits accession to the RKC, the government has made a strong commitment to simplify and \nmodernize customs laws, rules, and regulations, for which it needs technical assistance in \nvarious areas. This includes development of audit-based risk management systems, authorized \neconomic operators, and measures to enhance the transparency and speed of transactions at \nborders. Through the SASEC Trade Facilitation Program loan (footnote 8), Bangladesh has also \nagreed to pilot a scalable NSW led by the NBR. To implement these policy actions, Bangladesh \nis in need of adequate resources and capacity to put the new systems in place.11 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA is a reduction in the time and cost needed to undertake trade in \nBangladesh, which will be measured by faster export and import processes. The expected \noutcome  is  better  alignment  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  customs  procedures  and  practices  with \ninternationally accepted standards.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have three outputs, as follows:  \n(i)  Improved  border  clearance  mechanisms.  The  TA  will  assist  in  (a)  the \nformulation of necessary draft amendments to the Customs Act of 1969 and \nrelated legislation to make the act fully compliant with the general annex of the \nRKC; 12 (b)  the  conduct  of  a  regulatory  impact  assessment  of  proposed \namendments  to  the  Customs  Act  and  related  legislation  to  make  them  fully \ncompliant with the general annex; (c) establishment and operationalization of an \nauthorized economic operators program;13 (d) formulation of updated standard \noperating procedures on risk management, post-clearance audit, assessment, \nphysical  inspection,  and  nonintrusive  inspection  that  are  compliant  with  the \nStandards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade (SAFE) Framework; and (e) the \nconduct of WCO time release studies covering major border-crossing points to \nserve as benchmarks for a performance monitoring system.14 In collaboration \nwith the WCO, the TA will also help undertake training needs assessment on the \nabove areas, and conduct technical training on identified training needs. The TA \nwill also help identify and prepare future assistance by ADB in the above areas. \n                                                \n11  Bhutan and Nepal are also in need of resources and capacity to put into effect the reforms being promoted under \nthe SASEC Trade Facilitation Program loans and grants (footnote 9). \n12  ADB will coordinate with the International Finance Corporation in identifying the remaining gaps in similar work that \nit is supporting. \n13  ADB will coordinate with the United States Agency for International Development, which has plans to support \nsimilar work. \n14  The International Finance Corporation plans to carry out time release studies for Benapole and Chittagong ports, \nand the Dhaka Customs House. \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Strengthened customs automation. Through provision of experts and, possibly, \nsoftware  upgrades,  the  TA  will  support  the  NBR  in  the  transition  from \nASYCUDA++ to ASYCUDA World, which will be interfaced with a pilot NSW \nprogram  connecting  with  the  electronic  data  processing  systems  of  selected \nagencies such as commerce and shipping. Associated technical training for the \nNSW on the application of ASYCUDA World will also be supported by the TA. \nPilot testing of the new customs automation system will be carried out in at least \ntwo border checkpoints. \n(iii)  Enhanced trader access to information. The TA will strengthen the institutional \narrangements for trade facilitation by ensuring greater participation of traders and \nother private sector stakeholders. It will also assist in the development of a trade \nportal, which is being undertaken by the Ministry of Commerce under the SASEC \nTrade Facilitation Program loan.15 The planned trade portal will be linked to \nASYCUDA World. It will facilitate greater access of importers and exporters to \ntrade data and information, especially for timely processing and issuance of \nimport and/or export registration certificates and permits. \n \n13.  Attainment  of  the  TA\u2019s  expected  impact  assumes  that  other  ongoing  and  planned \ncomplementary trade facilitation measures achieve their desired results, and that transport and \nborder-crossing infrastructure along SASEC corridors has been upgraded or modernized. The \noutcome  of  the  TA  can  only  be  achieved  if  the  government  remains  committed  to  trade \nfacilitation and subregional cooperation with other SASEC countries. A key risk is that influential \ngroups with vested interests in the status quo lobby against custom reforms. The outputs of the \nTA can only be achieved if there is sufficient customs staff to carry out the needed customs \nreform. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.6 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and office accommodation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from  August 2013 to July 2015. The \nRegional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division of the ADB South Asia Department \n(SARD), in cooperation with the ADB Bangladesh Resident Mission, will be the  executing \nagency for the TA as the TA will support Bangladesh\u2019s participation in SASEC trade facilitation, \nfor which SARD is the secretariat. The NBR will be the implementing agency. ADB will work \nclosely with the WCO in implementing the TA. SARD will closely coordinate and regularly share \ninformation with the Customs and Tariff Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of Japan.  \n \n16.  A total of 136.5 person-months of consultancy services will be engaged for the TA. \nConsultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nthe Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended). \n \n                                                \n15  ADB will coordinate with IFC, which is assisting the Ministry of Commerce in developing the trade portal. \n ", "  5 \n17.  The TA will require 64.5 person-months of international consultancy services and 72.0 \nperson-months of national consultancy services, consisting of (i) international trade facilitation \nspecialist (team leader) (20.0 person-months); (ii) international customs law specialist (10.0 \nperson-months);  (iii)  international  NSW  and  information  and  communication  technology \nspecialist (12.0 person-months); (iv) international risk management and post-clearance audit \nspecialist (12.0 person-months); (v) international transport and transit specialist (6.0 person-\nmonths); (vi) international resource persons (4.5 person-months), who will participate in capacity \nbuilding activities to discuss international good practices and provide advice on specific TA \noutputs;  (vii)  national  customs  specialists  (48.0  person-months);  and  (viii)  national  trade \nfacilitation coordinating analyst (24.0 person-months). \n \n18.   Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  because  of  (i)  the  diversity  of  tasks  to  be \nundertaken, (ii) the expected active involvement of focal points in the NBR of Bangladesh, and \n(iii) active overall management of the TA implementation by SARD staff.  \n \n19.   The TA  will  be  monitored  and  coordinated  principally  through  the  meetings  of the \nSASEC TFTWG, the SASEC customs subgroup, and national and regional meetings to be held \nunder the auspices of the TA.16 Evaluation of the TA\u2019s outputs will be carried out by SARD \nthrough  the  annual  TA  implementation  review  mission  with  the  assistance  of  the  resident \nmission. \n \n20.   Good practices and lessons from the TA will be documented in the progress reports \nsubmitted to the SASEC TFTWG and posted on the SASEC website (www.sasec.asia). Good \npractices  and  lessons  learned  will  also  be  reported  during  meetings  of  ADB\u2019s  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Community of Practice. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Supporting Participation in the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nTrade Facilitation Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n16  ADB is planning to implement a regional TA, which will, among other things, help coordinate the activities of the TA \nand planned TA projects for Bhutan and Nepal in support of the SASEC Trade Facilitation Program loans and \ngrants. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact    For all indicators:  Assumptions \nReduction in time  By 2018, time needed to  Doing Business Report,  Other ongoing and planned \nand cost to trade in  export and/or import  World Bank    complementary trade \nBangladesh   decreases by at least 10%.  facilitation measures achieve \nBaseline: Average export time  their desired results. \n25 days, average import time   \n34 days (2012)  Transport and border crossing \n  infrastructure along SASEC \nBy 2018, costs of trade  corridors have been upgraded \ndecrease by at least 10%.   and/or modernized. \nAverage export cost $1,025,   \naverage import cost $1,430 \nper container (2012) \nOutcome      Assumption \nBetter alignment of  By 2015, the LPI Ranking of  LPI, World Bank  Government of Bangladesh \nBangladesh  Bangladesh has improved by  remains committed to trade \ncustoms procedures  10%.
