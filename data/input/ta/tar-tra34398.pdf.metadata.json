INTRODUCTION\n1.      A Fact-Finding Mission1  from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) visited Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan  on  14-25  May  2000  to  formulate  the  regional  technical\nassistance2  (TA)  project  for  the  Audit  Training  Program  for  Central  Asian  Republics.  The\nMission reached an understanding with the three governments on the objectives, scope, and\nimplementation arrangements of the proposed TA. The Mission also held consultations with\nofficials concerned at the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI),3\nINTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI),4 and Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions\n(ASOSAI).5  The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.    The ADB Anticorruption Policy6 provides increased emphasis to strengthening key\ninstitutions to advance transparency and accountability in ADB\u2019s developing member countries\n(DMCs), as part of ADB\u2019s broader emphasis on governance and capacity building. Within the\nframework of advancing accountability, ADB recognizes that improving accounting and auditing\nprocedures is the first line of reform in the public finance system. In this context, government\nauditing plays a key role in ensuring that adequate controls exist and work effectively, relevant\nlaws and regulations are complied with, public funds are properly safeguarded, and public\naccounts and records are properly kept.\n3.      ADB lending operations in the DMCs in the Central Asian Republics (CARs) started in\n1994 and have been growing since then. One requirement for ADB-funded loan projects is the\nsubmission of audited financial statements pertaining to the project. This requirement aims to\nstrengthen accountability for the use of funds, thus promoting sound financial management and\ngood governance. The Mission noted that for all existing loans to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic,\nand  Uzbekistan,    (i)  the  required  audits  are  being  conducted  by  private  auditors  since\ngovernment   auditing  is  focused  mainly  on  compliance  with  budgetary  regulations, and\n(ii) financial or performance audits are not generally conducted. While there is no prohibition in\nthe current laws or in their mandate, lack of expertise has kept the government auditors from\nundertaking such audits.  The Mission also noted that assistance to Kazakhstan by the World\nBank  and  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  by  the  European  Union  was  recently  provided  for\nstrengthening  auditing in those countries.  The assistance resulted in proposals for a new audit\nlaw or for revisions to the existing laws, as well as proposals for adopting international auditing\nstandards.  However, no training for auditors was provided under these projects and no further\nallocations were contemplated by the international organizations.  Although the international\norganizations did not provide similar assistance to Uzbekistan, Uzbekistan nevertheless initiated\nrevisions to its audit law.\n4.      The approach adopted in public sector audits in the three countries appears to be\ntransaction-based, which does not require the review of the systems that support the delivery\nand achievement of objectives, and does not correspond to the modern international concept of\nauditing.  It  therefore,  does  not  adequately  contribute  to  the  strengthening  of  systems  and\n                                                \n1  The Mission was composed of V. T. Virtucio, Senior Audit Specialist; and J. M. Lafreniere, Audit Specialist.\n2     The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in June 2000. \n3  INTOSAI is the professional organization of supreme audit institutions in countries that are members of the\nUnited Nations.\n4  IDI is the training arm of INTOSAI.\n5  ASOSAI is one of the regional working groups of INTOSAI. Kyrgyz SAI has been a member of ASOSAI since\n1994. Kazakhstan SAI is in the process of becoming an associate member.\n6  R89-98: Anticorruption Policy, 11 June 1998.", "2\ncontrols within government organizations. Suitable training in modern auditing techniques is\ntherefore required to enable government auditors to conduct effective and efficient audits.\n5.      Strengthening the skills of government auditors is considered timely with the recent\ncompletion of a TA7 that strengthened the institutional capacity of executing agencies of ADB-\nfinanced projects in preparing project accounts following government and ADB requirements,\nand therefore laid the basic groundwork for introducing a suitable training program in auditing.\n6.      One criterion for acceptability of auditors for ADB-funded projects is competence. To\nachieve competence, intensive training and a continuing professional development program for\nauditors are necessary.  Basic training in financial auditing, to be covered by the proposed TA,\nwill enable government auditors to have deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts of\nauditing. Simulated audits, focusing on ADB-funded projects, will be included in the training to\nprepare the government auditors to undertake financial audits of ADB-funded projects. The\ntraining will also introduce them to audit procedures and techniques established along lines of\ninternational best practice and applied in accordance with international standards.\n7.     The subject of fraud awareness and fraud investigations will be part of the training\nprogram so as to emphasize ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, and also to enable the government\nauditors to assist in conducting effective investigations on allegations of fraud and corruption.\n8.      To  ensure  the  sustainability  of  audit  knowledge  within  the  governments  of  the\nparticipating CARs, the program will likewise train the participants to effectively impart their\nacquired knowledge to other government auditors on a continuing basis.\n9.   A regional approach in training is consistent with ADB\u2019s program of encouraging\nregional cooperation.  Workshops will provide the participants an opportunity to discuss possible\nsolutions to problems and issues common to the three countries.  A regional approach will also\nfacilitate collaboration with IDI and ASOSAI, particularly in the use of relevant course materials\nthat have been utilized in other regional training seminars.\n10.     The TA will reinforce the benefits that Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic gained\nfrom the TA granted to them in 1997 for strengthening their accounting capabilities.  Uzbekistan\nis included in this TA due to the  commonalities, as noted by the Mission, in the three countries\nin the area of government auditing. These commonalities make it economically feasible to\nconduct the training on a regional basis8. The two other DMCs in the CARs namely, Azerbaijan\nand Tajikistan, could not be accommodated in this TA because (i) they were not part of the\nearlier  TA for strengthening accounting capabilities; and (ii) when the need for this TA was\nanalyzed in late 1998, Tajikistan had just joined ADB.  Azerbaijan joined later, in 1999.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n11.      The  TA  aims  to  improve    capacity  and  efficiency  in  conducting  financial  and\nperformance  audits  in  the  governments  of  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan\nthrough the introduction of basic auditing concepts and techniques consistent with international\nbest practices; and to enhance fraud awareness in government auditing as well as introduce\nbasic techniques in fraud investigation by training government auditors.  It is envisaged that,\n                                                \n7 TA 5724-REG: Capacity Building in Project Accounting in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Republic\nof Uzbekistan,  in the amount of US$500,000, and approved by ADB in February 1997.\n8     Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan have given their no-objection for inclusion in the TA.", "3\nwith enhanced auditing skills, government auditors would be able to assume the responsibility of\nconducting periodic audits of projects funded by ADB and other multilateral financial institutions.\nA.  Scope\n12.      The TA  will  include  (i) a study of government auditing in the participating CARs;  and\n(ii)  preparation  of  training  materials,  auditing  guidelines  and  training  manuals  for  the\nparticipating CARs, to be used in conducting a strategic planning workshop and an audit training\nworkshop  in  financial  and  performance  audits  including  training  the  trainers,  and  in  fraud\ninvestigation.  There will be an extensive use of the accounting manuals prepared under the\nprevious TA for capacity building in project accounting in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic\nto  familiarize  the  government  auditors  with  the  generally  accepted  accounting  principles\nadopted in the country.\n1.     Strategic Planning Workshop\n13.      This  will  be  a  three-day  strategic  planning  workshop  for  senior  officials  of  the\ngovernment audit institutions concerned. It will  provide a forum for these officials to discuss the\nfollowing: (i) the goals and objectives of the TA project,  (ii) actions to be taken to ensure that\nnewly acquired audit and investigation skills are applied on the job,  (iii) criteria for selecting the\nparticipants, and (iv) the governments\u2019 action plan to ensure the continuity of training within their\nrespective audit institutions. The workshop also aims to obtain commitment from the recipient\ngovernments that the participants would be allowed to complete the training program and\nencouraged to remain in their current or similar positions for a specified minimum period so that\ntheir newly acquired skills are put to use.  An evaluation framework will be prepared during the\nworkshop.\n2.  Audit Training Workshop\n14.    Three main topics will be covered in this workshop: financial and performance audit,\nfraud awareness in auditing, and training the trainers.  Financial and performance audit will take\nabout 17 days and will deal with the complete audit process comprising planning, execution,\nreporting, and follow-up. Two case studies involving simulated audits of an ADB-funded project\nand a selected government function will be used.  Fraud awareness will be imbedded within this\nsegment to familiarize the participants with the basic techniques of detecting potential fraud\ncases during an audit.  This will be followed by a three-day training-the-trainers segment to\nupgrade the presentation skills of the participants, and assist them in effectively passing on their\nacquired audit knowledge and skills to other government auditors in their respective institutions.\n3.    Fraud Investigation Workshop\n15.    The five-day workshop on fraud investigation will deal with preventing, investigating,\nand reporting fraud and corruption cases.  This workshop will be segregated from the audit\ntraining workshop due to its specialized nature. It aims to provide the participating CARs the\nflexibility of selecting other participants, whose jobs may be more suitable to this subject.  It is\nenvisaged that the workshop will be held at least two months after the completion of the audit\ntraining workshop.\n4.    Auditing Guidelines and Training Manual\n16.    Auditing guidelines for each of the recipient countries will be provided to serve as a\nguide for audits. The guidelines will include basic auditing techniques and highlight ADB\u2019s\nauditing  requirements.  The  training  manual  will  be  used  as  reference  in  training  other", "4\ngovernment auditors on a continuing basis.  The auditing guidelines and the training manual will\nbe in both English and the Russian language.\nB.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17.     The total cost of the  TA is estimated at $509,000 equivalent of which $500,000 will be\nprovided by ADB (Appendix 2) on a grant basis, from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the\nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  participating  governments  will  provide  the  remaining  $9,000\nequivalent, which represents the estimated cost of office accommodation and administrative\nsupport.\n18.    Due to the differences in the development of accounting and auditing in the three\nparticipating CARs, it is essential that ADB be represented in a mitigating role at the inception\nas well as at the end of the program. It is unlikely that the consultant engaged for this project\nwould be able to play this role.  Therefore, the associated costs to be incurred by ADB staff for\nattending the Strategic Planning Workshop and the tripartite meetings at the conclusion of the\nprogram are included in the TA costs.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n19.    The Executing Agency of the TA will be the Office of the General Auditor (OGA) of\nADB.  An international consulting firm with extensive experience in international accounting and\nauditing standards and practice and in working with supreme audit institutions (SAI), or an\nequivalent,  preferably  in  the  CARs,  will  be  engaged.  The  consulting  firm  will  provide  a\nconsultant who is fluent in the Russian language and has substantial experience in conducting\ntraining in the Russian language and in developing audit-related manuals.  Preference will be\ngiven to a consultant who is familiar with accounting and auditing standards and practice within\nthe governments of the CARs.\n20.     The consultant will be required to acquire the services of a domestic consultant in each\nparticipating CAR.  The domestic consultants will (i) be familiar with the local accounting and\nauditing practices in the government and have substantial experience in working with the local\nSAI, or its equivalent, (ii) assist the international consultant in preparing auditing guidelines and\ntraining manuals suitable for use in each participating CAR, and in developing training programs\nin auditing, training the trainers, and fraud investigations, and (iii) assist in the workshop in their\nrespective country.\n21.    The consultants in each participating CAR will  (i) conduct a study of the current\nauditing practice,  (ii) conduct a training need analysis,  (iii) develop training materials and case\nstudies for the workshops, (iv) conduct the workshops, (v) prepare the auditing guidelines and\nthe training manuals, and (vi) submit periodic reports to ADB regarding the workshops and other\nproject activities.\n22.     Approximately 22.5 person-months of consulting services will be required during an\nimplementation period of 20 calendar months.  The input is estimated to be 10 person-months,\nfor the international consultant and about 12.5 for the domestic consultants. The TA is expected\nto commence in January 2000 and be completed by August 2002.  The terms of reference for\nthe  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.    The  international  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplified technical proposal procedures and the Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.", "5\n23.     The three senior officials of audit institutions of the participating CARs are encouraged\nto attend the strategic planning workshop. The consultants will provide these officials with\nrelevant materials well in advance  to allow them to adequately prepare for the workshop.  The\ncriteria for selecting participants to the audit training workshop will be decided in the strategic\nplanning  workshop.    It  is  emphasized  that  this  audit  training  workshop  will  last  for  four\ncontinuous weeks.  As such,  the governments are expected to (i) be prepared for the absence\nof their staff from work for that period of time, and (ii) allow them to complete the workshops.  To\nmaximize learning and interaction, the size of the audit training workshop will be restricted to not\nmore than 36 participants (12 government auditors from each country).  Each Government may\ndraw an initial list of about 15 staff from whom to select the final 12 on a priority basis to ensure\navailability of replacements if needed.\n24.     It is envisaged that the strategic planning workshop will be held in Kazakhstan, the\naudit training workshop including the training-the-trainers program in the Kyrgyz Republic, and\nthe workshop on fraud investigation in Uzbekistan. The host governments will provide, at their\nexpense, adequate secretarial and clerical support and a furnished and equipped office for the\nconsultants while working on the project.\n25.     For the smooth implementation of the TA, each Government of the participating CARs\nwill appoint, at their  expense, a project coordinator (preferably from the SAI or equivalent) who\nwill be responsible for close interaction with the international consultant and ADB and for\nmonitoring the daily activities of the workshops.  These coordinators will also liaise with the\ninternational and domestic consultants and/or ADB in setting up the office to be provided by\neach Government for the project, in preparing the venue for the workshop in their respective\ncountries, and in the planned activities during the workshops. Details of the planned activities\nwill be decided during the strategic planning workshop.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n26.    The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$500,000 for the purpose of the Audit Training Program for Central Asian Republics, and hereby\nreports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\n1.
