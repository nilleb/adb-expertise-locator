The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will help build the \ncapacity of Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs) to enhance \nwater security and resilience in Asia and the Pacific. It will (i) support increased climate resilience \nin water projects, programs, and policies by facilitating a shift toward climate-resilient and low-\ncarbon development; and (ii) help build the capacity of DMC clients to use information and \ncommunication technology (ICT), digital and remote sensing technologies, and innovations. The \nTA cluster is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly operational priorities 2 (gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment), 3 (tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability), 4 (making cities more livable), and 5 \n(rural development and food security).1 The TA is included in the 2021 ADB Management-\napproved  results-based  work  plan  of  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment (SDCC) and in the Water Sector Group (WSG) work plan, 2021\u20132022.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Sector challenges. Climate change threatens achievements in economic development, \nimproved livelihoods, well-being, and water security for millions of people across Asia and the \nPacific.3 As the most disaster-affected region in the world, Asia and the Pacific is home to more \nthan 40% of disasters triggered by natural hazards and 84% of the people they affect. Climate \nchange  will  alter  ecosystem  services\u2019  benefits,  have  detrimental  health  impacts,  stimulate \nmigration, and possibly lead to conflicts. These changes disproportionately affect the poor, \nwomen, children, and the elderly.3 Many ADB DMCs with limited resources are extremely \nsusceptible to climate change impacts and lack investment and policy development to address \nclimate adaptation. \n \n3.  Water is the primary medium through which the effects of climate change are felt. Effects \nmay include increased, more intense, and frequent flooding; storm surges; and increased and \nprolonged droughts. The direct impacts on water resources and water, sanitation, and hygiene \nare already present across Asia and the Pacific and will continue to grow, threatening sustainable \nand inclusive prosperity in the region. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has also \nhighlighted the linkages between water, sanitation, and hygiene; climate resilience; and health. \nClimate change may also affect the chance of water-related disasters striking during pandemics \nand epidemics, compounding their impacts.4 \n \n4.  Contribution  to  global  commitments.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) by building resilience for water sector infrastructure, systems, and \nstakeholders. By doing so it will contribute to clean water and sanitation for all (SDG 6), poverty \nreduction (SDG 1), hunger reduction (SDG 2), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), and \naction to combat climate change impacts (SDG 13). \n \n5.  With ADB\u2019s water sector projects contributing about 60% to ADB\u2019s total climate adaptation \nfinancing, proactively targeting climate resilience through adaptation-focused water interventions \nand engagement with clients offers the greatest opportunity to develop more robust, sustainable, \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Additional upstream efforts are required at the country level to integrate project \nplanning with each country\u2019s nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies, so that \ninvestment projects are planned with an adaptation focus, rather than simply climate proofing them. \nIntegrating ICT and digital and remote sensing tools and technologies has become an important \nand necessary aspect of water resilience, increasingly available at cost-effective prices. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the glaring lack of digital technologies for water and \nsanitation service providers and the need to adopt them. The water sector has been slow to adopt \ndigital technology, with resistance stemming too often from lack of awareness of what is available \nand affordable. The gender divide is particularly evident in the water sector in service delivery and \nwater resources management. Improving water resilience will benefit women and girls since climate \ninduced disasters affect them disproportionately as primary care givers.  \n \n6.  Building resilience and adaptive capacity is one of the five guiding principles in the \nupcoming ADB water sector framework, 2021\u20132030.6 In 2021, the WSG prepared a guidance note \nthat provides an operational road map to integrate climate resilience into the water sector and DMC \ninvestment planning and policy development.7 Additional assistance is needed for ADB and its \nclients to implement this road map and these measures, so that current and future water operations \nand programs of ADB and its DMCs can shift their focus towards adaptation and resilience. \n \n7.  Digitalization. To support and spearhead digitalization for water resilience in DMCs, the \nWSG  will  foster  collaboration  with  development  partners,  institutions,  and  private  solution \nproviders.  In  March  and  October  2021,  ADB  organized  e-marketplace  events  for  water \nmanagement, bringing together ICT and digital and remote sensing technology solution providers \nand connecting them with water sector DMC clients and staff. The WSG plans to continue such \nevents and synthesize solutions, both internal and global best practices, on an interactive virtual \nlearning hub for staff and DMC stakeholders. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n8.  Owing to the increasing need for greater resilience in the water sector, the TA cluster \nmodality allows (i) greater flexibility to mobilize resources from multiple funding and knowledge \npartners, and (ii) a harmonized, phased, and holistic approach to supporting DMC clients. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n9.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: resilience in the water sector of Asia \nand  the  Pacific  enhanced  (footnote  1).  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  resilient \ninvestments and policies in the water sector increased.8 It will help DMCs mainstream water \nresilience by increasing climate adaptation and promoting digitalization through four outputs \n(paras. 10\u201317).9 \n \n5  Based on 2016\u20132020 figures. \n6  ADB.

Manila. \n8   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  The TA cluster will maintain particular emphasis on inclusive decision-making processes and systems to include \nwomen and girls while delivering all outputs and outcome. \n \n ", "3 \n10.  Output 1: Climate resilience integrated into water projects, programs, and policies. \nThe TA will help DMCs strengthen climate actions in the water sector, particularly on adaptation, \nthrough all phases of investment planning, policy making, and project preparation. It will help \nintegrate climate resilience into water sector investment projects and programs, with a focus on \ngroup A and B countries, across the full project cycle, emphasizing upstream work to ensure \nclimate resilience considerations are incorporated at pre-concept or the earliest possible stage of \nwater project development.10 This will help projects embrace climate considerations and DMCs \nbuild the capacity to transition toward full adaptation type (Type II) projects, which in turn would \nhelp ensure more robust and resilient development pathways. Support may include: (i) climate \nrisk  and  adaptation  assessments;  (ii)  employing  the  latest  technologies  (gray  and  green \ninfrastructure) with an emphasis on nature-based solutions, digitalization, and earth observation; \n(iii) review of planning and engineering guidelines; (iv) ensuring that projects and programs are \nParis Agreement aligned;11 (v) calculating climate adaptation finance; (vi) conducting economic \nand/or financial analysis for adaptation-focused projects, because clients are often concerned \nabout additional costs for resilience measures; (vii) assistance with project readiness; and (viii) \nenhancing  the  enabling  environment  and  capacity  to  mobilize  nonsovereign  financing  and \nleveraging access to climate finance from concessional resources. ADB will select DMCs based \non a comparative needs assessment and following a demand driven approach.  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  provide  support  for  water  sector  assessments  for  country  partnership \nstrategies and upstream diagnostic work related to water and climate resilience and/or DMC water \nsector or subsector programs that mainstream climate resilience, i.e., long-term strategies and \nsectoral and/or national policies. At national and subnational levels, the TA will strengthen the \nstakeholders\u2019 capacity to plan, budget, deliver, monitor, report, and verify climate outcomes and \nclimate finance, particularly on adaptation for the water sector. \n \n12.  Individual consultants and firms will be engaged to assist operations departments and \nDMCs depending on their specific needs. This will include use of a framework agreement for a \npre-qualified roster of technical specialists or consultants. \n \n13.  Output 2: Digitalization integrated into water management. The TA will support the \nintegration of innovative ICT and digital and remote sensing technologies in ADB\u2019s projects and \nprograms in two ways:12 \n \n(i)  The TA will provide support to selected municipal and village governing bodies, \nutilities, water resource management entities, or other sector-related organizations \nand agencies in DMCs on the use of ICT and digital and remote sensing tools and \ntechnologies to improve operations. Technologies may include:  \n(a)  supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) (traditional and cloud-\nbased),  hydro-meteorological  measurement  and  information  systems, \nasset mapping and management tools, internet of things and internet of \npeople (mobile based) and other ICT and digital technologies for service \ndelivery improvement and nonrevenue water reduction in water supply and \nsanitation services delivery; and  \n(b)  earth  observation,  remote  sensing,  drone  technologies,  geographic \ninformation system (GIS), and digitalization to improve water resources \n \n10  ADB. 2019. Classification of Developing Member Countries. Operations Manual. OM A1. Manila. Group C countries \nwill also be supported for full adaptation type (Type II) projects. \n11 The Paris Agreement (2015) has reframed climate action from a focus on the near-term incremental increase of \nadaptation and mitigation actions to emphasize the long-term transformation of economies and societies.  \n12 Around ten proposals from many operational departments have been received and tasks are being detailed out.  \n \n ", "4 \nmanagement, including flood risk management; enhance food security \nthrough  increased  agricultural  production,  energy  efficiency,  crop \nefficiency, and irrigation scheduling; improve water quantity and quality \nmonitoring, biodiversity monitoring, and tracking of pollution loads and \nillegal dumping of pollutants into the rivers; support dams and canals \nmanagement  optimization;  and  improve  governance,  financing,  and \ncapacity.  The  TA  may also  provide  support  during  upstream  work  of \noperations  departments  to  develop  investment  projects  with  high \nreadiness, demonstration value, and scalability. The TA will maintain a \nfocus on strengthening inclusive decision-making processes and systems \nto include women and girls. \n(ii)  The TA will provide deep dive or handholding support to selected water supply and \nsanitation  service  providers,  water  resource  managers,  and  sector-related \norganizations and agencies on digitalization to improve operations, efficiency, and \nresilience.  These  entities  will  undergo  a  process  of  (a)  gap  identification  or \ndiagnostic study and (b) an assessment of needs and readiness for digitalization. \nSupport will include identifying entry points for pilot projects and implementing the \npilot integration of ICT and digital and remote sensing technologies to improve \nresilience and efficiency. Based on the pilots, ADB will prepare an improvement \nand scaling-up plan, including training and capacity-building, to ensure gains \nachieved are sustained and replicated. \n \n14.  Output 3: Capacity development for increased water resilience supported. The TA \ncluster will enhance water sector DMC stakeholders\u2019 capacity to plan and implement resilient \nservices as follows: \n \n(i)  The TA will support the establishment of a virtual Asia and the Pacific water \nresilience hub.13 The hub will be a collaborative platform with a water community \napproach to DMC water resilience capacity-building and will facilitate coalitions of \ninternal and external stakeholders to leverage collective efforts toward resilience. \nIt  will  partner  with  established  knowledge  partners,  universities,  specialized \ntraining centers, and think tanks on water resilience to assist in tailored training, \ncapacity-building,  and  upskilling  DMC  partners\u2019  knowledge  and  skills.  Skills \nmapping  of  selected  DMC  water  clients  will  be  conducted,  with  gender \ndisaggregated data, with support from operations departments. The hub may \ndevelop and provide tailored training courses or capacity enhancement sessions \nthrough established partners. The hub will include an interactive data and virtual \ncapacity enhancement center to enable knowledge sharing and management on \nwater resilience for DMCs.  \n(ii)  The TA will help enhance DMC water sector stakeholders\u2019 awareness and capacity \nin  climate-resilient  policy  making  and  investment  planning.  It  will  support \ncounterparts in line agencies, utilities, local bodies, and planning and finance \nministries, through workshops, seminars, and/or training to build capacity, create \nan enabling environment, and improve absorptive capacity to (a) balance water-\nrelated investment and infrastructure needs against future risks and consideration \nof climate investment options; (b) enhance access to climate finance; (c) promote \n \n13 The proposed hub will be shaped based on the needs of ADB\u2019s water sector implementing and executing agencies\u2019 \nfeedback, skills mapping, and extensive consultations with clients and partners. A mapping of similar hubs has \nalready been conducted. ADB will partner with relevant regional hubs, stakeholders, training centers, and/or utilities \nto harness collective knowledge and outcomes. \n \n ", "5 \ncollaboration between stakeholders; (d) develop climate strategies and policies by \nfully addressing environmental and climate change considerations; (e) integrate \nhard infrastructure investments with improved policy making and governance; (f) \npromote environmental sustainability and soft interventions such as nature-based \nsolutions;  (g)  promote  the  water-energy-food  nexus;  (h)  promote  institutional \nreforms  in  agencies;  (i)  create  institutional  and  cross-sectoral  incentives  for \nclimate-resilient projects; and (j) create development policies and projects that \npromote full adaptation investments. \nThe TA cluster will enhance DMC water sector stakeholders\u2019 awareness and \ncapacity in ICT and digital and remote sensing resilience through customized \ntraining courses and/or workshops to share lessons.  \n \n15.  Output 4: Support for increased knowledge base on water resilience expanded. The \nTA will help develop and disseminate a range of knowledge products, which will include guidance \nand/or technical notes to support resilient development in the water sector and knowledge products \nto promote resilience tools and technologies. Dissemination will include various modalities, such as \nworkshops, seminars, and/or training, use of social media platforms, and production of web-based \nmaterials, to facilitate wider reach and accessibility beyond the TA duration.  \n \n16.  The TA cluster will help produce, share, and manage knowledge through the development \nand dissemination of knowledge products and services for DMC counterparts to better incorporate \nclimate resilience in water sector projects, programs, and policies. To improve and standardize \napproaches, the TA will carry out a detailed review of ADB water sector projects to analyze the \ndata sources, tools, and approaches used; adaptation and resilience components incorporated; \nand lessons learned. This will be combined with a comparative review of international best \npractices. A knowledge framework will be developed, for the water sector, on aspects such as: (i) \ncollation and incorporation of latest climate information and projected medium- to long-term \nclimate  change  impacts;14 (ii)  assessment  tools  and  best  practices  for  climate  risks  and \nvulnerability screening; (iii) robust evaluation approaches for incorporating climate uncertainty in \nproject design; (iv) tools for conceptualizing and incorporating hard and soft climate resilience \ncomponents  into  project  design;  (v)  detailed  guidance  and  tools  for  aligning  water  sector \ninvestment projects and programs to the Paris Agreement; (vi) tools for estimating adaptation \nfinancing ; (vii) cost\u2013benefit considerations and return on investment estimates; (viii) strategies \nfor  transforming  projects  with  adaptation  attributes  to  full  adaptation  projects;  (ix)  climate \nadaptation  finance  scaling-up  for  institutional  and/or  intersectoral  incentives;  and  (x) \nunderstanding the opportunities for climate financing through internal or cofinancing sources. \n \n17.  The TA will support knowledge production, sharing, and management on ICT and digital \nand remote sensing technologies through events such as periodic e-marketplaces to cross \nconnect digital solution providers to DMC water sector stakeholders and staff and to share lessons \nfrom the experiences of water service providers and water resource management organizations. \nIt will also support production of knowledge products, such as annual e-newsletters that promote \ntools and technologies on water resilience and security. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $5,000,000, of which (i) $2,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund; (ii) $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \n \n14 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 2021.
