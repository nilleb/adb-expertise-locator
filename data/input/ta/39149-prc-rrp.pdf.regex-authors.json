An environmental impact assessment was completed; the \nAssessment  summary was circulated to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board \nand made public through the ADB website on 9 April 2007.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project is located in western Guangxi, one of the poorest areas in \nthe PRC. With a per capita gross domestic product that is 63% of the \nnational  average,  Guangxi  ranks  27th  among  the  31 administrative \nareas.  The  Project  is  designed  to  promote  pro-poor  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  western  Guangxi,  preparing  it  to  cope  with  an \nincreasingly important role in regional cooperation and trading with Viet \nNam. The Project will provide an integrated road transport network in \nwestern Guangxi by (i) constructing the 177 kilometer (km) Longlin\u2013\nBaise  expressway;  (ii)  upgrading  the  associated  1,060  km  of  local \nroads;  (iii) improving  road  transport  services  by  constructing \n50 township  bus  stations  and  implementing  passenger  bus  route \nlicensing reforms; (iv) improving road maintenance by implementing \nrural  road  maintenance  policy  reform;  and  (v)  improving  corporate \ngovernance  and  strengthening  institutional  capacity  by  providing \nconsulting services, equipment, and training. \n   \nRationale  Underdeveloped  roads  and  transport  services  are  major  causes  of \npoverty in Guangxi. Rural poverty incidence is 30% in the project area, \nparticularly  in  the  border  area  with  Viet  Nam.  Existing  transport \ninfrastructure is currently being used to saturation levels, creating high \ntransport costs for producers and consumers. This transport bottleneck \nneeds to be removed to facilitate the movement of goods and people \nbetween  rural  and  urban  areas  and  between  interior  and  coastal \nprovinces. \n \nThe Project will improve an important national transport network by \nbuilding  a  section  from  Baise  to  Longlin  (Guizhou  border)  of  the \nKunming  (Yunnan)\u2013Shantou  (Guangdong)  corridor,  one  of  the  high \npriority east\u2013west corridors in the PRC. It will connect the poor and \nisolated interior provinces (Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan) and the city of \nChongqing to the nearest seaports in Guangxi (Beihai, Fangcheng, and \nQinzhou) and Guangdong (Map 2). \n \nThe Project is one of the high priority projects identified by the Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Transport  Sector  Strategy,  which  was \nendorsed by the six GMS governments at the 11th meeting of the GMS \nTransport Forum in Vientiane, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic in \n2006.  The  Project  will  provide  the  missing  link  in  the  Kunming\u2013\n ", "iv \nNanning\u2013Hanoi section of the GMS economic corridor. The Project will \n(i) improve border roads and transport services for trade activities, and \n(ii) provide facilities and equipment to meet expected demand for freight \ntransshipment and storage at the border crossing point in Pingxiang \n(international land port with Viet Nam). It will link Nanning and Kunming, \nthe two major growth centers in the western PRC to Hanoi (Viet Nam), \nsupporting  the  strategic  thrust  of  strengthening  connectivity  and \nfacilitating cross-border movement and tourism with Viet Nam (Map 1).  \n   \nImpact and  The Project will contribute to pro-poor sustainable economic growth in \nOutcome  western  Guangxi  and  northern  Viet  Nam.  This  will  be  achieved  by \ndeveloping  an  efficient,  safe,  and  environment-friendly  regional \ntransport system to promote trade in, and through, western Guangxi \nand reduce trade barriers with Viet Nam. \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $1,566  million \nPlan  equivalent. Of the $300 million ADB loan, $40.26 million will finance \nnonexpressway  components  including  rural  roads  ($28.6  million), \ntownship  bus  stations  ($1.4  million),  border-trade  logistics  center \n($10 million), rural transport service demonstration project ($0.16 million), \nand a rural road maintenance study ($0.1 million). \n \nFinancing Plan   ($ million) \n \nSource     Amount   % \n  Asian Development Bank  300.0  19.0 \n  China Bank of Communications   550.0  35.0 \n  Ministry of Communications  170.0  11.0 \n  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional \n546.0  35.0 \nPeople\u2019s Government \n  Total  1,566.0  100.0 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. \n \nAllocation and  The PRC Government will make the ADB loan proceeds available to \nRelending Terms  the  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Regional  People\u2019s  Government \n(GRG), and further to the Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) \nwith the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan \nwith GCD bearing the exchange rate and interest rate variation risk. On \nimplementation  of  the  GCD  restructuring  plan,  and  incorporation  of \nGuangxi  Communications  Investment  and  Construction  Group \nCompany Limited (GCIG), GCD will onlend the loan proceeds to GCIG, \nwith GCIG then bearing the exchange rate and interest rate variation \nrisk. All relending and onlending under the Project will be on the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \n ", "v\n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 April 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 October 2012 \n   \nImplementation  The Project Management Office (PMO) established within GCD will be \nArrangements  responsible for overall implementation of the Project.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Guangxi Communications Department  \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  works  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Contracts and mode of procurement envisaged under \nthe  Project  are  indicated  in  the  procurement  plan.  ADB  approved \nadvance contracting on 26 February 2007 and retroactive financing for \neligible expenditures not exceeding $30 million on 4 April 2007.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The ADB loan will finance 45 person-months of international consulting \nservices  for  supervising  construction;  providing  advice  on  structural \nengineering,  pavement,  road  safety,  road  transport  services,  and \ncorporate  governance;  and  formulating  a  capacity  development \nprogram. The international consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nThe Project will also finance national consulting services for the (i)  rural \ntransport  services  demonstration  project,  and  (ii)  rural  road \nmaintenance policy reform study, each at an estimated cost of no more \nthan $100,000. The required national consultants will be recruited in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  In \naddition, GCD will engage and finance 7,700 person-months of national \nconsulting services. All national consultants, not financed by ADB, will \nbe recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to \nADB. \n   \nProject Benefits  The expressway forms part of the Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi section of \nand Beneficiaries  the GMS economic corridor, which is a major artery for the regional \ntransport network connecting with national and regional roads. It will \nhave a significant, positive impact on the economic development of the \nregion. \n \nThe expressway will reduce travel time by at least 3 hours and shorten \nthe travel distance between Baise and Longlin by 34 km. Improved \nlocal roads will link villages to the road network and border areas with \nViet Nam, and hence to the national and regional economy. Improved \nrural  transport  services  will  link  rural  households  with  the  wider \neconomy. A developed and efficient transport network will integrate \npoor  isolated  regions  with  the  centers  of  economic  growth.  The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is 17.5%. The financial \ninternal rate of return is 4.5%, which is higher than the real weighted \naverage cost of capital. The Project will directly benefit about 2.3 million \npeople in Baise, of whom 87% live in rural areas and 30% of these live \non  less  than  $1  per  person  per  day.  The  Project  will  also  benefit \n ", "vi \n240 million people indirectly in the southwestern region of the PRC. \nMore  broadly,  the  Project  will  benefit  the  three  poor  northeastern \nprovinces in Viet Nam adjacent to Guangxi with a total population of \n2.3 million. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit road users (e.g., passengers, traders, \ntransport providers, and bus and truck operators), as well as labor, the \nlocal economy, and the private sector. The Project will help reduce \ntraffic accidents, vehicle emissions, and traffic noise in the corridor. The \nProject will also boost tourism. Rural households are also important \nbeneficiaries, and will benefit from increased incomes through better \naccess  to  roads,  transport  services,  markets,  off-farm  opportunities, \nand better access to trade services. The Project will create 18.6 million \nperson-days of local employment amounting to CNY318 million in wage \npayments  during  construction,  and  another  CNY20  million  of  wage \npayments expected to go to the local communities annually after start \nof project operation. A total of 18,500 local people are likely to gain \nemployment and skills training throughout the Project. The ability and \nskills  of  local  communities  will  be  greatly  enhanced.  The  improved \nregional transport system will enhance the local investment climate to \nattract more investment to the region and act as a catalyst for future \ninvestment.  \n   \nRisks and  The  Project  is  formulated  to  reduce  technical,  economic,  financial, \nAssumptions  safety, and social risks. The main technical risks are associated with \nthe construction of tunnels and bridges. Project preparatory technical \nassistance  consultants  have  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and \nconstruction methods and found them in order. During implementation, \nthe bidding system will focus on contractors\u2019 financial and technical \ncapabilities in handling similar complex works. Monitoring and contract \nmanagement  information  systems  will  be  set  up  to  quickly  identify \ntechnical  and  environmental  problems  and  correct  them.  The \ncontractors will be required to strictly enforce work safety rules and \nmeasures. GCD has experience and has performed satisfactorily in \ninternationally financed projects. \n \nThe financial risk associated with construction and operation of the \nexpressway will depend on traffic volume, capital cost, and toll rates. To \nmitigate the financial risks, GCD will build up a commercial business \nenvironment  for  expressway  operations,  the  Project  will  receive \nsubstantial injections of equity from central and provincial governments, \nand a market-oriented toll structure will be adopted. The Project has no \nmajor environmental, resettlement, or HIV/AIDS infection risks; and has \nmitigation and monitoring mechanisms in place. GCD demonstrated \nsignificant ownership in preparing the resettlement plan, environmental \nimpact assessment, and ethnic minorities development plan. \n ", "Map 1\n98 o 00'E 108 o 00'E\nNorth-South\nCorridor Northern\nCorridor Guilin\nI N D I A\nMyitkyina Dali\nHexian\n24 o 00'N\nKunming\nLongshuanka\nChuxiong Wuzhou\nRuili Mangshi Baise GUANGXI ZHUANG\n24 o 00'N Tamu Yuxi AUTONOMOUS REGION\nYUNNAN PROVINCE\nPEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nHS Tonzang Muse Gejiu Yulin\nEDALGNA Chindwin R.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Western Guangxi Roads Development Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC has made remarkable progress in economic growth and poverty reduction \nsince the late 1970s. However, its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is still modest, and \nabout 135 million people living on less than $1 day consumption line (more than 10% of the \nglobal poor).1 Moreover, the distribution of income is highly imbalanced between eastern coastal \nand interior provinces and between urban and rural areas. Poverty is more widespread in the \nwestern region. Infrastructure constraints and lack of access to consumer markets are the main \ncauses of the region\u2019s high incidence of poverty. Thus, developing economic infrastructure in \nkey corridors, including seaport links and trade corridors connecting the western and coastal \nregions, is essential to promote trade and reduce regional development disparities in the long run. \n \n3.  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) is one of the five autonomous regions  \n(equivalent to a province) in the PRC. Guangxi has highlands in the northwest and lowlands in \nthe southeast, and mountains on three sides. Since Guangxi is the only western province with a \ncoastline, it assumes a very important role in the Western Region Development Program. \nGuangxi borders Guangdong province in the east, Hunan and Guizhou provinces in the north, \nYunnan in the west, and Viet Nam in the south. Hence, it provides a strategic link between the \nresource-based economies in the western PRC and the trade-oriented economies in the eastern \nPRC. The proposed Project forms an integral part of the east\u2013west trade corridor connecting the \nsouthwest hinterland provinces with coastal provinces. Together, the five provinces (Guizhou, \nYunnan, Guangxi, Chongqing city,2 and Sichuan) have a population of about 240 million, about \n19% of the country\u2019s total. Support for developing the proposed corridor will extend the benefits \nof increased accessibility to the west region, where average incomes are the lowest in the PRC. \n \n4.  Like  other  parts  of  the  PRC,  Guangxi\u2019s  economy  has  grown  rapidly.  Nevertheless, \nGuangxi still lags the coastal provinces and the country as a whole. With a per capita GDP of \nCNY8,788 in 2005 (63% of the national average), Guangxi ranks 27th of 31 administrative areas. \nGuangxi\u2019s per capita GDP is only about one third of Guangdong province. The lack of an \nefficient and effective transport system is an important constraint for the sustainable growth of \nGuangxi. Although road density by area or by population is comparable to the national average, \nroad density by area (2.61 kilometers [km] per 1,000 square km) is only 40% of Guangdong \nprovince; and class-II and above roads comprise 13% of all roads, or half of Guangdong \nprovince. Guangxi has a 1,595 km coastline. Given its geographic location, transport corridors in \nGuangxi need to be developed into the western region and within Guangxi. \n \n5.  Developing  markets  becomes  more  important  as  the  PRC  becomes  more  open \neconomically. The openness ratio, measured as the ratio of foreign trade to GDP, reached 60% \nin 2005 from 31% in 1991. Coastal provinces benefit from much greater shares of investment \nand foreign trade than inland provinces. Guangdong accounted for 30% of the PRC\u2019s foreign \ntrade in 2005. The southwestern region, including Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Chongqing, and \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2006. China Country Partnership Strategy (2006\u20132010). Washington. \n2  One of four provincial-level municipalities in the PRC. \n ", "2 \nSichuan, accounted for 0.10% to 0.56%. While the western region accounts for over 28% of the \ncountry\u2019s population, it accounts for only 3.2% of total foreign trade; it has yet to benefit from the \ntrade-led growth. Since the use of transport infrastructure is essential to any trade-oriented \neconomy, the western region needs to improve its infrastructure to attract investment to develop \nenterprises that take advantage of abundant raw materials and relatively low labor costs. If \nwestern provinces are to have an important share of the country\u2019s total trade, access to these \nprovinces must improve, and constraints on the transport of trade overcome. \n \n6.  More than 90% of the poor in the PRC live in rural areas. Roads usually are the only \nmode of transport that can help the poor reach markets and services. Recognizing the role of \nrural roads in reducing poverty, the Government has accelerated rural road improvement to \nclose the development gap between urban and rural areas.3 During the 10th Five-Year Program \n(FYP) 2001\u20132005, investment in rural roads totaled CNY418 billion, three times that in the \nprevious 5 years. By 2010, all villages will have road access, and all townships will have paved \nroads. Paved roads will link all eastern villages, 88% of central villages, and 50% of western \nvillages. To achieve this, the indicative plan prepared by the Ministry of Communications (MOC), \nenvisages investment in rural roads to reach about CNY800 billion (about $100 billion) from \n2006  to  2010.  Of  this,  MOC  will  provide  CNY140 billion,  representing  17.5%  of  the  total \ninvestment; the provinces and domestic and foreign loans will finance the remainder. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Challenges \n \n7.  Despite rapid economic growth, the PRC has suffered from imbalanced growth among \nthe provinces. In 2005, the GDP per capita of the western provinces was about half of the \nnational average and only one third of that in the eastern coastal region. The road network still \ndoes not provide adequate access to the poorer inland region; vast distances and difficult \nmountainous terrain isolate it from local, regional, and national markets. Most exports and \nimports  reach  major  markets  through  other  provinces,  meaning  that  regional  transport \ndevelopment is an important determinant of growth and development. \n \n8.  Guangxi has made significant progress in poverty reduction since 1990s as a result of \neconomic growth and concentrated development efforts. Nevertheless, it remains one of the \nmost  underdeveloped  regions  in  the  PRC.  Currently,  Guangxi  has  28  national  designated \npoverty  counties,  accounting  for  4.7%  of  total  national  poverty  counties  in  the  PRC.  The \n28 counties  have  4,060 identified  poverty  stricken  villages  with  an  average  net  per  capita \nincome of CNY1,586. These villages account for 28.4% of the total administrative villages in \nGuangxi. Twenty-one additional counties are provincial designated poverty counties. Almost all \nborder counties in Guangxi are poverty counties and among the poorest poverty counties in the \nPRC. Three provinces in Viet Nam\u2019s northeast region are adjacent to Guangxi: Quang Ninh, \nLang Son, and Cao Bang, with a population of 2.3 million in 2005, 2.8 % of Viet Nam\u2019s total. \nThey are the poorest in Viet Nam (Map 2). Improvement of border roads in border counties will \nstimulate cross-border trade and consequent employment opportunities for the poor living along \nthe border area with Viet Nam. The problem and constraints analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  Inadequate infrastructure is the main reason for the project area\u2019s high incidence of \npoverty. The project area includes one district and seven counties in Baise,4 of which seven are \n                                                 \n3  In 2005, the annual per capita net income of rural households was CNY3,255 ($402), while the annual per capita \ndisposable income of urban households was CNY10,493 ($1,306), three times more than that of rural households. \n4  Baise is a prefecture-level city that includes an urban district, 11 counties, and one autonomous county. \n ", "3\n   \nnational designated poverty counties (Map 3).5 About 30% of rural residents are poor and \npoverty incidence exceeds 40% in four counties. Furthermore, due to mountainous terrain, most \nof  the  rural  population  is  scattered  in  13,710  sub-villages  that  lack  basic  infrastructure, \nespecially roads. In Baise, 592 administrative villages are not served by an all-weather road and \n3,844 natural villages have no road access. Without the minimum of accessibility, they are \nunable to integrate into the market economy, their income level will remain low, and their \neconomic  growth  will  not  be  achievable  or  sustainable.  The  counties  with  the  greatest \naccessibility  problems  also  have  limited  financial  resources,  and  therefore  need  the  most \nsupport for rural road development from national and provincial governments as well as ADB. \n \n10.  Between 1995 and 2005, road freight in Guangxi grew at an average annual rate of \n6.1% and passenger traffic grew by 9.3%. The increased traffic is reflected in main corridors, \nincluding national highway (NH) 324. NH324, which runs parallel to the project expressway, is \nmainly class-III roads with insufficient shoulders, very poor alignment, and limited capacity. \nBetween  1995  and  2005,  NH324  traffic  increased  by  an  average  12.7%  per  annum.  The \naverage travel speed is about 40 km per hour. Traffic congestion is growing and will exceed the \nroad\u2019s capacity by 2012; several sections are already approaching their capacity. The road is \ndangerous as it has many side frictions due to the high incidence of slow-moving traffic and \nsubstantial ribbon development on most of its length. When completed, the project expressway \nwill  help  to  ease  severe  congestion  and  traffic  accidents,  and  improve  traffic-induced  air \npollution in the project corridor. \n \n11.  Poor  roads  have  also  led  to  inadequate  and  costly  transport  services.  In  Baise, \n580 administrative villages and 3,564 natural villages have no direct access to formal licensed \nbus services as bus operators are unwilling to use bad roads because of high costs and danger. \nTransport demand is usually met by various informal transport services such as motorized \ntricycles,  dual-purpose  pickups,  and  agricultural  tractors.  During  the  10th  FYP,  Guangxi \nCommunications Department (GCD) formulated plans to provide organized bus services to rural \nareas. In general, formal bus services are of better quality, but suffer from low rates of vehicle \nutilization because of poor roads, low demand, inefficient scheduling of vehicles, and rigid bus \nroute licensing system. This results in relatively high unit costs. The project preparation survey \nindicates that 40%\u201360% of households are not satisfied with the quality of services in Longlin \nand Xinlin counties. \n \n2.  Government and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n \n12.  The  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP,  2006\u20132010,  focuses  on  balanced,  equitable,  and \nsustainable development, with a strong emphasis on rural and western region development. \nThe Government pledges to increase farmers\u2019 incomes, improve infrastructure, and enhance \npublic services in the countryside. Road development is a high priority as an effective means of \npromoting  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty.  To  reduce  regional  disparities,  the \nGovernment aims to link the western region with central and eastern regions, provide western \nregion access to trade outlets at sea and land ports, and promote regional cooperation with \nneighboring countries. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the PRC road sector gives high priority to removing infrastructure \nconstraints and supporting policy and institutional reforms. ADB supports (i) building roads that \nconnect  major  growth  centers,  and  improving  access  in  the  western  and  central  regions; \n(ii) integrating the network so that the national trunk highway system is supported by a system \n                                                 \n5  The project area is defined as Youjiang district, Longlin and Tianlin counties on the line of the expressway, and \nXilin, Leye, Linguyn, Tianyang, Jiangxi counties on the line of the local roads, all in Baise (Map 3). \n ", "4 \nof local roads, particularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) promoting road safety \nand reducing vehicle emissions; (iv) strengthening corporatization and commercialization of \nexpressway organizations; (v) adopting appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of \nroad transport capacity; and (vi) using alternative methods of investment financing, including \nprivate sector participation. ADB assistance for roads targets the poor western provinces and \nregional economic corridors. The Project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities \nand ADB\u2019s strategy. The road sector policy reform matrix is in Appendix 3 and road sector \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n  3.  Opportunities \n \n14.  The expressway from Baise to Longlin (border with Guizhou) is an important section of \nthe Kunming (Yunnan) to Shantou (Guangdong) national high-priority east\u2013west corridor. The \nproject expressway also forms part of the Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi section of the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) economic corridor (Map 1).6 This road corridor not only supports the \nGMS Economic Cooperation Program, but also the Two Corridors-One Ring7 initiative between \nthe  governments  of  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam,  which  started  in  July  2005.  Opening  up  the \ntransport corridor will strengthen connectivity and facilitate cross-border movement of goods \nand tourism, thereby promoting economic growth and reducing regional disparities.8  \n \n15.  Cross-border  economic  cooperation  is  especially  important  for  the  poor  regions  in \nGuangxi and Viet Nam as many are border areas. The value of cross-border trade amounted to \n$1,049 million (exports $386 million and imports $663 million) in 2006. About 85% of the exports \nand  77%  of  the  imports  are  traded  by  private  enterprises  and  individuals.  The  area  has \n11 crossing points (four class-I land ports and seven class-II land ports) and 28 small border \ntrade markets along Guangxi\u2019s 637 km border with Viet Nam. The four class-I ports\u2014Dongxing, \nPingxiang, Shuikou, and Longbang\u2014are by far the most important. While cross-border trade is \nminor in the overall context of the PRC, the existence of a border port is crucial to local \ncommunities for both Guangxi and Viet Nam, and future regional border trade. The Project will \nupgrade rural roads and build township bus stations to improve the access of Jingxi (border \ncounty) to its nearest crossing point at Longbang (national class-I land port), Yuexu (class-II \nland port) and small-scale trade markets. \n \n16.  Eighty percent of Guangxi\u2019s population of 49 million is rural. The climate is subtropical \nmonsoon. Although agriculture features strongly in the economy, primary industry is decreasing \nas a proportion of GDP. In 2000, primary industry accounted for 26% of Guangxi\u2019s GDP but by \n2005, this had fallen to 22%. Secondary industry accounted for 37% of GDP in 2005, the same \nas in 2000. Tertiary industry is leading growth in GDP, accounting for 41% in 2005 as compared \nwith only 37% in 2000. The orientation of Guangxi\u2019s economic structure is conducive to the \ngeneration of major trade flows. Improved transport infrastructure will improve the investment \nclimate, increase the production and export of mineral products, reduce the transport cost for \ncash crops, and promote tourism. \n \n17.  External assistance to the PRC road sector has come mainly from ADB, Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, and World Bank. Since 1991, ADB has extended 34 loans totaling \n                                                 \n6  The GMS comprises Cambodia, Guangxi, and Yunnan of the PRC, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. With ADB assistance, the six member countries launched the GMS Program in 1992. \nGuangxi joined the GMS Program in 2004. \n7  Two corridors represent Nanning\u2013Hanoi (Viet Nam) and Kunming\u2013Hanoi corridors. One Ring means Economic \nBelt around Beibu Gulf (Gulf of Tonkin).   \n8  The GMS Program does not include Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, and the city of Chongqing, which are likely to have \nsignificant trading relationships with GMS countries including Viet Nam. They will benefit from the project corridor. \n ", "5\n   \n$6.9 billion to finance 4,589 km of expressways and 9,321 km of associated local road networks. \nProject  completion  reports  prepared  for  18  road  projects  conclude  that  17 were  highly  or \ngenerally successful and 1 partly successful.9 ADB has also supplied 62 technical assistance \n(TA) projects totaling $34 million to the road sector. The advisory TA projects have addressed \npolicy  and  institutional  issues,  including  highway  planning,  road  safety,  socioeconomic \nassessment,  transport  pricing,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial  resources.  The \nWorld Bank has provided about $7.1 billion and Japan Bank for International Cooperation about \n\u00a5219  billion  to  finance  road  investments  (Appendix  4).  ADB  coordinates  with  both  these \norganizations to ensure that each major development partner focuses on different corridors, and \ninformation related to policy advice is shared across the development community. \n \n4.  Lessons \n \n18.  The evaluation of ADB assistance for roads and railways in the PRC10 concludes that \n(i) ADB\u2019s program for roads was successful overall, and (ii) ADB has potential to formulate new \nfocus and priorities to continue playing a significant role in the road sector. The evaluation \nrecommends that transport services is a useful area for ADB support since transport service \nefficiency is an important factor in determining the benefits of transport improvements to users, \nparticularly the poor. A proactive approach is being taken in this area. Guangxi was selected as \none of the case study provinces in the ADB TA Sustainable Rural Transport Service.11 The TA \nreviewed the current issues in the provision of rural road transport services and recommended a \nnumber of reforms to help establish more demand-responsive services between townships and \nnearby villages. The proposed reforms of rural transport services will be demonstrated and \ntested by a pilot demonstration project (estimated to cost $160,000 and to be financed by ADB) \nin Baise to ensure that the reforms are workable before introducing the reforms throughout the \ncountry. \n \n19.  GCD has successfully implemented four externally financed road projects without major \nproblems.12 While the overall performance of road projects is satisfactory, several identified \nissues are reflected in the design of the proposed Project and are discussed in paras. 20\u201322. \n \n20.  Planning and design of interchanges, and administrative and service facilities merit \nrigorous examination and review before contracts are awarded.13 To ensure good quality at the \ndesign stage, (i) the preliminary designs were started early and reviewed carefully by national \nand provincial road engineers; (ii) site investigation was more comprehensive at the preliminary \ndesign stage; and (iii) close site supervision of international and national supervising consultants \nwill be undertaken to ensure quality and timely scheduling and completion of work. \n \n                                                 \n9  The partly successful rating is mainly due to inadequate safety facilities and enforcement. Remedial actions were \ntaken to rectify the issues. The Project was rated as satisfactory in the project performance audit report after \nremedial measures were taken. \n10  ADB. 2007.

Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Sustainable Rural Transport Service. \nManila. \n12  The Fangcheng Port Project (includes a 48 km highway), Guangxi Roads Development Project (approved in 2001), \nand Guangxi Roads Development II Project (approved in 2004) financed by ADB, and the Guangxi Highway \nProject financed by the World Bank (main highway opened to traffic in September 2004). \n13  Under the 2001 Guangxi Roads Development Project, one toll plaza was found to be incorrectly located and the \ndesign of the non-ADB financed portion was inconsistent with traffic demand. The additional works required to \nrectify the noted deficiencies resulted in additional cost and prolonged project implementation. It also contributed to \nthe lower than expected traffic on the expressway (opened to traffic in December 2005). \n ", "6 \n21.  Traffic demand forecasts for expressways in Guangxi need to be improved. The lower \ntraffic volume on the Guangxi Roads Development Project (Guangxi I)14 during the first year of \noperation was due to overoptimistic estimates of future GDP growth in the counties traversed by \nthe expressway15 and slower than expected implementation of agreements related to border \ntrade with Viet Nam. For the proposed Project, this should not be a problem as the majority of \ntraffic is established, long-distance, through traffic. Given the completion of the contiguous ADB-\nfinanced Guangxi Roads Development II Project (Guangxi II) expressway from Nanning to \nBaise by 2008,16 the diversion to the project expressway from the existing NH324 for long \ndistance traffic is expected to be immediate. However, the forecast traffic volumes on the \nexpressway have conservatively assumed a ramp up17 in traffic diversion volumes in the first \nfew years of operation. \n \n22.  Institutional  and  corporatization  plans  need  to  be  closely  aligned  with  that  of  the \ngovernment, in terms of capacity and time frames. In the past, difficulties were experienced in \nimplementing the corporatization agenda for Guangxi I due to inadequate regional readiness. \nEventually in 2005, Guangxi Southwest Expressway Company Limited (SWEC) was formed to \noperate roads constructed under Guangxi I and II. GCD has also realized that instead of \nadopting a piecemeal approach to corporatization, a more efficient approach is to consolidate \nnot  only  operation,  but  also  construction  of  the  expressways  in  Guangxi  under  a  single \ncorporate entity, which can then access financial markets for raising additional capital. GCD has \ninitiated a restructuring plan (para. 23). Given the progress achieved, the private sector is also \nshowing interest in GCD\u2019s restructuring agenda. The Project, therefore, works within Guangxi\u2019s \nown corporatization plans, and streamlines the direction and process. \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n \n23.  Pioneering  Institutional  Arrangements.  Within  GCD,  Guangxi  Communications \nInfrastructure Administration Bureau (GIAB) constructs expressways in Guangxi, and Guangxi \nExpressway Administration Bureau (GEAB) provides operation and maintenance (O&M). Prior \nADB-financed projects led to the creation of SWEC in 2005. SWEC is responsible for operation \nof  roads  under  both  Guangxi  I  and  Guangxi  II  projects.  The  dialogue  on  institutional \narrangements with GCD during project preparation helped raise awareness of the importance of \ndeveloping an integrated corporatization approach. GCD has now constituted a working group \nto  develop  a  restructuring  plan  to  establish  Guangxi  Communications  Investment  and \nConstruction Group Company Limited (GCIG). GCIG will be structured to consolidate both GIAB \nand  GEAB,  either  as  operating  divisions  or  subsidiaries.  GCIG  will  also  take  over  SWEC \noperations of, and thereby assume complete responsibility for construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of the project expressway and other expressways in Guangxi. GCD agreed to \ncomplete its analysis and prepare a restructuring plan for consolidation of relevant expressway \noperations of GIAB, GEAB, and SWEC in GCIG by 31 October 2007. GCD will implement its \nrestructuring plan, and incorporate and commercialize GCIG by 30 June 2008. The integrated \napproach will help to build a strong GCIG to effectively build, manage, and utilize assets; and \nprovide efficient services for road users. An institutional road map and action plan for GCIG \nagreed with GCD is set out in Appendix 5. \n \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n17  Ramp-up is the propensity for some traffic not to immediately transfer from the existing road to the expressway as \nits benefits are not immediately known to all who would benefit from diversion. \n ", "7\n   \n24.  Promoting  Corporate  Governance.  Consolidation  of  construction and  operation  of \nexpressways  from  the  existing  government  bureaus  into  a  separate  corporate  entity \nincorporated under the new Company Law of the PRC (effective 1 January 2006) is a first step \nin promoting corporate governance. The new Company Law includes provisions for disclosure \nof interest by directors, representation of employees on the board of directors, external audit, \nand constitution of a board of supervisors to have general oversight over the board of directors. \nA corporate development plan will be developed by 31 March 2008 to set additional standards \nfor corporate governance, management, financial reporting, and human resource development \nin GCIG. A comprehensive institutional development and training program will be implemented \nin close coordination with various divisions in GCD. Additionally, GCD and GCIG will enter into \nconcession agreement/s to ensure that GCIG has autonomy in construction and operation of the \nhighways; and assumes responsibility for meeting all agreed financial, engineering, technical, \nenvironmental, and O&M standards. \n \n25.  Facilitating Private Sector Participation (PSP). In the PRC, the private sector has \nbeen  involved  in  the  road  sector  through  cooperative  joint  ventures,  build-operate-transfer \nprojects,  and  other  forms  of  securitization.  In  Guangxi,  PSP  has  mostly  been  used  for \nexpressways connecting larger cities, e.g., the transfer of operation rights of part of the Guilin\u2013\nLiuzhou expressway to a joint venture between GCD and a Hong Kong investment bank. GCD's \n11th FYP aims at introducing more PSP. GCD will explore various options with potential private \ninvestors in close consultation with ADB to ensure that project implementation progresses \nsmoothly. In addition, 6 months prior to the opening of the project expressway, GCIG will \nanalyze the feasibility of tapping financial markets for future road sector investments, and \npossible PSP in O&M of the project expressway. Therefore, establishment of GCIG will facilitate \nPSP in the road sector in Guangxi on a strategic basis. \n \n26.  Improving Rural Transport Services. Despite good progress in providing rural transport \nservices connecting townships with counties, some villages still do not have roads and bus \nservices. In the project area, passenger bus productivity (the average daily kilometers driven per \npassenger bus) is very low (30 km/day on average for small buses). This reflects low demand, \npoor roads, inefficient scheduling of vehicles, and inability to rotate buses onto other routes. Unit \ncosts are consequently high. Therefore, the first priority will be to increase passenger bus \nproductivity. A system of regional licenses that eases the requirement that buses and drivers be \nrestricted to fixed routes will result in increasing productivity and lower unit costs. Under the \nProject, GCD agreed to implement bus route licensing reforms between townships and nearby \nvillages in Baise. Implementing the reforms will allow operators flexibility in customizing their \nroutes, schedules, and services in line with passenger needs, and use their vehicles and drivers \nmore efficiently. Ultimately these lower costs should enable lower fares in terms of quality of \nservice provided. The proposed reforms will be tested by a rural transport reform demonstration \nproject. Experience from the demonstration project will be replicated in other areas. Appendix 6 \nprovides a discussion of rural transport services and policy reform in Guangxi. \n \n27.  Enhancing Road Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC including Guangxi. \nThe Project will address road safety by (i) focusing on black-spot analysis and treatments, and \nenhancing road signage along the project local roads; and (ii) enforcing stringent controls on \nspeeding and vehicle overloading, and (iii) conducting road safety audit. Traffic police in the \nregion  will  enforce  traffic  laws  including  stringent  speed  management,  enhancing  vehicle \ninspection and driver license systems, deterring unacceptable road-user behavior, and providing \n24-hour  hotline  service.  The  police  also  will  conduct  education  campaigns  targeting \n ", "8 \ncommunities through lectures and publicity materials developed under the ADB Road Safety \nImprovement TA (Appendix 7).18 \n \n28.  Introducing Weight-Based Tolls. To control overloaded vehicles, GCD will implement \nweight-based tolling for all expressways and parallel toll highways by the end of 2007. The \nprinciple behind weight-based tolling is that goods-carrying vehicles pay a rate per ton-km \nbased on the weight class of the vehicle plus a penalty rate per excess tonnage. Experiences \ngained in other provinces show that this is an effective way to manage overloaded vehicles if \ncomplemented with effective control measures. For example, after introducing the weight-based \ntolls, overloaded vehicles were reduced from 40% to 17% in Shandong province, and from 65% \nto 13% in Anhui province (Appendix 7). \n \n29.  Controlling Vehicle Emissions. The Government has taken several steps to control \nemissions: imposing regulations on the automobile industry, requiring an annual vehicle test, \nand improving the vehicle inspection and maintenance program. The new measures also set \nemission  and  fuel  efficiency  targets,  and  offer  tax  incentives  for  manufacturers  of  more \nenvironment-friendly cars. Guangxi follows national vehicle emission control strategies including \nenforcing national emission standards for new vehicles, improvement of conventional fuels and \nalternative or cleaner fuels, vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, and retirement of \nobsolete polluting vehicles. The strategic vehicle emission reduction plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n6.  Rationale for ADB Support \n \n30.  Constraints and Opportunities. Rural poverty incidence is very high in the project area \n(Map 3). Roads and transport services are underdeveloped, which is a major cause of poverty. \nExisting  transport  infrastructure  is  currently  being  used  to  saturation  levels,  creating  high \ntransport costs for producers and consumers. This transport bottleneck needs to be removed to \nfacilitate moving goods and people between rural and urban areas, and between interior and \ncoastal provinces. At the national level, the Project will connect interior provinces, now poor and \nisolated, to the nearest seaports in Guangxi and Guangdong. At the regional level, the Project is \none of the high priority projects identified under the GMS Transport Sector Strategy,19 endorsed \nby the six GMS governments at the 11th meeting of the GMS Transport Forum in Vientiane, Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic in March 2006. It is also included in the Strategy for the Closer \nIntegration of Guangxi into the GMS, and GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program \nUpdate (2007\u20132009).20 The Project will provide the missing link in the Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi \ntransport corridor, which will support the GMS strategic thrust for strengthening connectivity and \nfacilitating cross-border trade and tourism with Viet Nam (Map 1). \n  \n31.  Project Alternatives Considered. Considering the existing and future socioeconomic \nconditions in the western region of the PRC, trade, economic development, poverty, volume and \ncomposition of traffic on the corridor, and capacity of the existing transport infrastructure, the \nproposed alignment was selected as the most cost-effective and appropriate way to improve \ntransport. The alternative of improving existing roads was investigated and rejected as being \nneither  technically  viable  nor  cost-effective  in  the  long  run.  Also,  technical  alternatives  to \nconstruct class-I or class-II highways were discussed and rejected. Four alternative expressway \nalignments  were  also  studied.  The  proposed  alignment  has  obvious  advantages  and  was \ntherefore selected. Appendix 9 summarizes the project alternatives considered.

In addition to financing, ADB\u2019s involvement will contribute to \n(i) integrated corporate development strategy and sound corporate governance for the project \nexpressway, (ii) continued strengthening of road management practices, and (iii) management \nof sector externalities (safety, environment, and social dimensions). ADB also contributed to the \nintegrated design of the Project by working closely with GCD on the selection of local roads that \nwill link into the national high-priority corridor and poor minority villages. Upgrading of the project \nborder road will be linked with measures to promote cross-border trade, which will improve \naccess for rural communities and small-scale traders in a much more cohesive way to provide \nan  integrated  transport  solution  to  transport  needs.  Most  importantly,  ADB\u2019s  involvement \naccelerates institutional and policy reforms to improve corporate governance, road transport \nservices, and road maintenance practices. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n33.  The Project will contribute to pro-poor sustainable economic growth in western Guangxi \nand northern Viet Nam. This will be achieved by developing an efficient, safe, and environment-\nfriendly  regional  transport  system  to  promote  trade  in,  and  through,  western  Guangxi  and \nreduce trade barriers with Viet Nam. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n34.  The project outputs will be derived from the following components: \n \n(i)  Component A. (a) Construction of 177 km, access-controlled toll expressway \nfrom  Baise  to  Longlin  (Guizhou  border);  and  (b)  installation  of  facilities  and \nequipment at the Wantong Logistics Center at Pingxiang, on the main Nanning\u2013\nHanoi corridor. \n(ii)  Component  B.  Upgrading  of  1,060  km  of  local  roads  in  Baise  comprising \n(a) 3 priority border road sections totaling 50 km, (b) 3 priority rural road sections \ntotaling 260 km, and (c) village access roads totaling 750 km. \n(iii)  Component C. (a) Construction of 2 border area bus stations at Longbang and \nYuexu, and 48 township bus stations in Baise, and (b) implementation of the \npassenger bus route licensing reform in Baise. \n(iv)  Component D. Implement rural road maintenance policy reform in Baise. \n(v)  Component  E.  Improve  corporate  governance  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity by providing consulting services, equipment, and training. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n35.  Border-Road Improvement for Trade Activities. This includes upgrading three border-\nroad sections totaling 50 km: (i) the Jingxi\u2013Longbang road is an important link integrating the \ntransport system and the planned development of the land ports in Longbang and Yuexu; and \n(ii) two border access roads, one accessing a border livestock market and a planned border \n\u201ctrading street,\u201d and the other providing improved access to a new border facility and freight \nstation. The improvements will facilitate access to border ports to stimulate border trade, create \nemployment opportunities, and increase regional cooperation with Viet Nam. The border road \nupgrading will serve strategic border development projects that are expected to result in a \n ", "10 \nsignificant increase in trade and traffic. By lowering transport costs and improving the transport \nlinks to the Viet Nam border at Pingxiang, Longbang, and Yuexu, the Project will spur economic \nactivity and interregional and international trade, helping reduce poverty over a wide region, \nincluding on both sides of the border. The ADB loan will provide $13.2 million to finance border-\nroad improvements for trade activities (Appendixes 10 and 11). \n \n36.  Rural Road Improvement for Network Integration. This comprises three rural road \nsections  totaling  260  km  linking  to  expressway  interchanges  and  thereby  integrating  the \nexpressway to the local road network and rural areas. It will help spread the benefits to the poor \nand minorities, who are mainly farmers and dependent on local road networks to reach markets. \nBetter  connections  between  the  expressway  and  rural  roads  will  enable  more  agricultural \nproducts to reach markets and allow farmers to upgrade their farming practices. As reliable \ntransport to markets becomes more readily available, cash crop farming in remote or isolated \nareas will be stimulated and access to off-farm employment opportunities will be broadened. \nFresh and high-value-to-weight agriculture products will be made profitable to market due to \nlower transport cost. The ADB loan will provide $12.4 million to finance rural road improvement \nfor network integration (Appendix 10). \n \n37.  Village Road Improvement for Poverty Reduction. The primary objective of the village \nroad improvement is poverty reduction. Under the recently completed World Bank financed \nSouthwest Poverty Reduction Project, Guangxi Poverty Alleviation and Development Office \n(GPAO) learned that (i) improving rural infrastructure was a powerful and fast-acting measure to \nimprove well-being and poverty, and (ii) utilizing an integrated approach is very effective for \naddressing severe poverty. A major innovation, led by GPAO under the World Bank project, was \nsupport for village access roads. The improved access roads had important synergistic effects \non other project activities (for example, with road access, schools and heath clinic construction \nwas made much easier and materials such as chemical fertilizer for agricultural activities were \nmore easily transported to the area). The project preparatory interviews observed that poor \nhouseholds  were  extremely  supportive  of  projects  implemented  by  GPAO.  Working  in \ncollaboration with GPAO, the Project will provide $3 million to rehabilitate 750 km of 4,000 km of \nrural roads in the project area following the village roads implementation framework (VRIF) \nagreed upon with GCD. The VRIF, as presented in Supplementary Appendix B, integrates a \nresettlement framework; environmental framework; and technical, procurement, and financial \nmanagement framework.  \n \n38.  Rural Transport Services. To improve the availability, efficiency, and affordability of \nrural passenger services, the Project includes a component to help GCD achieve the 11th FYP \nstrategy  of  improving  the  accessibility  of  isolated  rural  and  border  communities.  It  will \n(i) construct 48 class-V township bus stations in Baise and two class-III border stations at \nLongbang  and  Yuexu;  and  (ii) implement  passenger  bus  route  licensing  reforms  to  allow \noperators the flexibility to customize their routes, schedules, and services to increase demand, \nraise productivity, lower costs, and more closely meet the needs of rural communities. The ADB \nloan will provide $1.56 million to finance the rural transport services component. Together with an \nexisting rural bus services tax deduction scheme,21 these will help expand the network of formal \nbus services and spread the benefits of improved accessibility that will be brought about by the \nProject\u2019s expressway and local road components (Appendix 6). \n \n                                                 \n21  It applies only to buses with at least 20% of their route on roads of class IV or lower. They receive a 30%\u201350% \nreduction (depending on vehicle size and the proportion of the route on rural roads) in the road maintenance fee, \npassenger surcharge, transport management fee, and flood control and security fee; and a 50% reduction in city \nconstruction tax, transport facilities maintenance fee, and vehicle safety inspection fee. \n ", "11\n   \n39.  Energy Efficiency and Reduced Vehicle Emissions. By July 2010, before the project \nroad opens, Guangxi is expected to have adopted stricter emission standards for both new and \nused vehicles. The Project will significantly contribute to control of vehicle emissions because it \noffers better road roughness value, lower congestion, and more efficient operation. In the first \nyear of the expressway operation, fuel savings are expected to be more than 11,000 tons oil \nequivalent, or 25% lower than without the Project. This will result in the reduction of pollutant \nemissions of 39,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ), 5,100 tons of carbon monoxide (CO), and \n2\n1,200 tons of hydrocarbon in 2012. The direct benefit of the increased capacity on the new \nexpressway and the improved traffic flow on NH324 will result in a total reduction of CO  by \n2\n4.7 million ton over the 20-year forecast period. Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau will \nmonitor emissions on project roads (Appendix 8). \n \n40.  Regional Cooperation. Discussions are under way between the governments of the \nPRC and Viet Nam to expand the existing bilateral road transport agreement on exchange of \ntraffic rights along the Nanning\u2013Hanoi corridor. This corridor is part of the GMS  transport \ncorridors identified under the GMS Transport Sector Strategy (Supplementary Appendix C). \nAgreement on this is expected by 31 December 2007. To meet expected demand for freight \ntransshipment and storage, the Project will provide facilities and equipment at the Wantong \nLogistics Center at Pingxiang on the main Nanning\u2013Hanoi corridor. Based on the user need \nsurveys, a list of trade logistics facilities and equipment was selected and agreed with GCD, of \nwhich ADB will finance $10 million to help reduce transshipment costs and delays to multimodal \ntransport flows in Pingxiang. In addition, the project expressway will improve regional linkages \nfor long-distance traffic; the project border roads will substantially reduce travel times and costs \nfor  road  freight  and  passengers;  and  the  passenger  bus  stations  and  bus  route  licensing \nreforms  will  improve  the  availability,  efficiency,  and  quality  of  road  passenger  services \n(Appendix 11). \n \n41.  Rural Road Maintenance. Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the sustainability \nof  rural  roads.  Building  on  the  new  national  policy  for  funding  and  managing  rural  road \nmaintenance announced by the State Council in 2005, GCD\u2019s 2006 rural road maintenance \npolicy reform is to be introduced in three trial cities. GCD will also implement the reform in Baise. \nImplementation  of  the  policy  reform  will  help  ensure  improved  funding,  a  systematic  and \npreventive approach, and more local privatization. The Project will help increase attention to the \nneeds of rural road maintenance by local government officials, and increase skills needed by \nlocal road authorities and communities to carry out road maintenance. GCD agreed to conduct a \nstudy  on  rural  road  maintenance  estimated  at  $100,000  to  be  financed  by  the  loan \n(Appendix 12). \n \n42.  Environmental Institutional Capacity. Paving of the Tianlin\u2013Leye road will eliminate \nthe dust that plagues roadside communities for 6\u20137 months of the year. People living along the \nroad  will  benefit  greatly  from  this  air  quality  improvement.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the \nmanagement capability of the Cenwanglaoshan Nature Reserve Management Organization by \nproviding financing of up to CNY890,000 for capacity building, monitoring, and supervision in \naccordance with the approved environmental impact assessment (EIA). The Project will also \nsupport ecosystem monitoring focused along the road. This will be a valuable contribution to the \nfuture protection of Guangxi\u2019s biodiversity, and will introduce better nature reserve management \nand operation methods to the Cenwanglaoshan Nature Reserve Management Organization. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n43.  The project investment cost is estimated at $1,566 million, including taxes (Table 1). \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 13. \n ", "12 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta  ADB Financing \nA.

Interest during construction is computed at the 5-year forward London \ninterbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.6%. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n44.  The Government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35% per annum, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The ADB loan will finance 19% of the total project cost. The \nremaining cost will be financed by MOC; Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional People\u2019s \nGovernment (GRG); and cofinancing through a loan from China Bank of Communications, \nwhich has appraised the Project and provided a commitment letter to GCD (Table 2). MOC and \nGRG have made budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. The PRC Government will \nmake the ADB loan proceeds available to GRG, which will relend to GCD, with GCD bearing the \nexchange rate and interest rate variation risk. On implementation of the GCD restructuring plan \nand incorporation of GCIG, GCD will onlend the loan proceeds to GCIG. GCIG will then bear the \nexchange rate and interest rate variation risk. All relending and onlending under the Project will \nbe on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource          Amount          Percent \nAsian Development Bank  300.0    19 \nChina Bank of Communications  550.0    35 \nMinistry of Communications  170.0    11 \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional  546.0  35 \nPeople\u2019s Government   \nTotal  1,566.0     100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "13\n   \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \n45.  GCD will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project implementation. Within \nGCD, the project activities will be coordinated by three bureaus\u2014GIAB (GCIG after June 2008), \nGuangxi Highway Administration Bureau (GHAB), and Guangxi Transport Administration Bureau \n(GTAB)\u2014the implementing agencies. The Project Management Office (PMO) established within \nGCD will be responsible for overall project implementation. The PMO is led by a deputy director \ngeneral, five deputy chiefs (three directors from GIAB, GHAB, GTAB, and two directors in GCD). \nUnder the overall direction of the PMO, three sub-PMOs have been identified to be responsible \nfor  implementation  of  the  following  components:  (i) GIAB,  for  the  expressway  under \ncomponent A(a); (ii) GHAB for local road improvement and maintenance under components B \nand D; and (iii) GTAB for transport service improvement under component C. GCD, through \nPMO,  will  directly  implement  the  cross-border  trade  facility  under  component  A(b),  and \ncorporate  governance  under  component  E.  GCIG,  after  its  incorporation,  will  take  over \nimplementation of component A(a) in accordance with the terms of its concession agreement. \nThe PMO will coordinate and oversee project implementation, submit progress and audit reports \nto ADB, and organize ADB supervision missions. Organization charts are in Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n46.  The Project will be implemented over about 5 years, from October 2007 to October 2012. \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 14. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n47.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The expressway works will be divided into 13 packages, 10 of \nwhich will be financed by ADB and procured under international competitive bidding procedures. \nAll  pavement  and  equipment  packages  will  be  financed  by  ADB  and  procured  under \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. All other packages, including connector roads, \ntraffic safety and management facilities, landscaping works, buildings, and ancillary facilities will \nbe financed by the Government and procured under government bidding procedures acceptable \nto ADB. Local road sections and the two border bus stations financed by ADB will be procured \nthrough national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and \nBidding Law (1999), subject to clarifications to the law that have been agreed with ADB for the \npurposes of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. All village access roads and 48 class-V township \nbus stations financed by ADB will be procured through shopping procedures. Various thresholds \nfor procurement and the contract packages are set out in the procurement plan in Appendix 15. \nThe  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be \nincluded in all documents and contracts related to project bidding and implementation. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n48.  The Project will finance 45 person-months of international consulting services, including \n27 person-months for the team leader of the international consultants; and 3 person-months \neach for the following specialists: (i) bridge, (ii) tunnel, (iii) road pavement, (iv) road safety, \n(v) restructuring  and  corporate  governance,  and  (vi)  road  passenger  transport.  The  road \npassenger  transport  specialist  will  be  directly  recruited  from  the  international  consultant \nengaged for the Sustainable Rural Transport Service TA (footnote 11) to provide necessary \n ", "14 \nadvisory inputs for the rural transport services demonstration project. All other international \nconsultants will be selected and engaged based on a full technical proposal using the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Project will also provide $100,000 each \nto finance (i) a rural transport services demonstration project, based on the recommendations of \nthe Sustainable Rural Transport Services TA (footnote 11), and (ii) a rural road maintenance \npolicy reform study. The two TAs will be undertaken by the national consulting firms. Given the \nvery small contract values and the intensive relevant experience of the two national firms22 \nproposed by GCD in the areas of the studies, these firms will be selected using the single-\nsource selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. In \naddition, GCD will engage and entirely finance 7,700 person-months of national consultants. \nThe national consultants, not financed by ADB, will be recruited in accordance with government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The chief supervision engineer will be responsible for overall \nproject supervision, assisted by two deputies, one of whom will be the team leader of the \ninternational  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n49.  ADB  approved  advance  contracting  on  26  February  2007;  this  includes  the \nprequalification  of  contractors,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  awards.  The  advance \ncontracting will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. ADB also \napproved the requested retroactive financing for eligible expenditures not exceeding $30 million \nincurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan \nagreement. The Government has been advised that approval of the advance contracting and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n50.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be \nmade for large contracts, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw \nthe  loan  funds.  If  the  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB's \nreimbursement procedure will be used. To expedite funds flow and simplify the documentation \nprocess, Guangxi Finance Department may establish an imprest account as required by GCD \nafter  loan  effectiveness.  Disbursement  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an \nappropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest \naccount will be set as either the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the \nloan account, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided into the imprest \naccount  in  respect  of  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $200,000  in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the Borrower and ADB. \n \n  7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n51.  GCD and GCIG, after its incorporation and commercialization in accordance with the \nterms of the restructuring plan, will maintain separate accounts for the Project and related \nfinancial  statements,  and  will  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  appropriate \n                                                 \n22  Institute of Comprehensive Transportation of National Development and Reform Commission, and Southwest \nJiaotong University.  \n ", "15\n   \nauditing  standards  consistently  applied  by  independent  auditors,  whose  qualifications, \nexperience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. GCD and GCIG will submit to ADB \nwithin  6 months  of  the  end  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project \naccounts and financial statements, and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, in both English and \nChinese. A separate audit opinion on the use of statement of expenditures and the imprest \naccount, if any, will be included as part of the auditor\u2019s report. During project implementation, \nGCD and GCIG will submit quarterly progress reports. GCD and GCIG will provide ADB with a \ncompletion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n  8.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the local and central governments. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency, GIAB, GCIG, GHAB, GTAB, \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. \n \n53.  GCD and GCIG will ensure, during the project implementation, that (i) officials from the \nDiscipline  and  Inspection  Bureau  will  monitor  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii) an \ninternal audit unit will be established in GCIG; (iii) a two-contract system will be adopted where \nthe winner of a civil works contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; \n(iv) periodic inspection of contractors will be undertaken to ensure that fund withdrawal and \nsettlement procedures are followed, and (v) the status of procurements and awards of contracts \nwill be published on GCD\u2019s website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. GCD \nand GCIG will initiate liaison meetings with the Prosecutor's Office, as needed, to discuss any \nwarnings about, or information on, any corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices.  \n \n  9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n54.  The project performance monitoring system (PPMS) indicators, their relevance, and \nmonitoring  practicalities  were  confirmed  and  agreed  with  GCD  during  project  preparation. \nBaseline  socioeconomic  and  trade  indicators  are  in  Appendix  16.  The  key  indicators  and \nassumptions outlined in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and monitoring of \nsocioeconomic  and  poverty  impacts  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  will  form  the  core  data \nrequired for this assessment. GCD will measure the indicators and report the key findings to \nADB on project inception, during the mid-term review, at completion, and for 3 years thereafter. \nGCD will recruit a capable local institute to provide 20 person-months for surveys, analysis, and \nreporting. The terms of reference are included in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n  10.  Project Review \n \n55.  Two years after the Project starts, GCD, GCIG, and ADB will carry out a midterm review \nof the Project, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, \nsocial, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may \nhave an impact on the project\u2019s performance and its continuing viability. \n ", "16 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n56.  The existing national highway is congested and carries high traffic volume. The Project \nwill increase the corridor\u2019s capacity to meet transport demand and will significantly reduce \ntransport costs and travel times. The expressway will reduce the trip length between Baise and \nthe Guizhou border by 34 km and result in time savings of at least 3 hours. Traffic on the \nexpressway is forecast to grow from an average 6,330 passenger car units per day in 2012 to \nan average of 30,500  per day in 2032. To reflect experience in previous projects, the opening \ntraffic projection considers the \u201cramp-up\u201d effect (footnote 17) on expressways immediately after \nopening (Appendix 17). \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n57.  The  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing \nscenarios with and without the Project. The project\u2019s economic costs reflect (i) the capital cost \nfor construction including physical contingencies, land acquisition, and resettlement; (ii) O&M \ncosts,  which  include  replacing  depreciated  equipment  and  periodic  maintenance;  and \n(iii) environmental monitoring costs. The economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating \ncosts as a result of reduced road length, and improved traffic and road conditions; (ii) time \nsavings for road users; (iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents; and \n(iv) benefits from generated traffic. The Project is economically viable. The EIRR for the whole \nProject is 17.5%. The EIRR is 17.1% for the expressway, 21.7% for the local road network, and \n29.2% for the rural transport service component. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of \nthe project\u2019s economic viability (Appendix 18 and Supplementary Appendix G). \n \nC.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n \n58.  The proposed toll rates23 for the project expressway are considered reasonable to attract \nsufficient traffic to meet the criteria for the economic and financial internal rates of return. \nFinancial projections have been prepared in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects (2005). Projected financial statements indicate that its \ninternal financial revenues will be sufficient to cover O&M costs and debt service from the sixth \nyear of full operation. The expressway financial internal rate of return is estimated at about 4.5% \nafter  taxes\u2014better  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.3%,  also  net  of  taxes. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the financial internal rate of return is robust under adverse \nconditions.  The  Project  is  considered  to  be  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Financial \nmanagement assessment found that the Project meets the minimum financial management \nrequirements and can provide accurate and timely information on its status in the reporting \nformat agreed with ADB (Appendix 19 and Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nD.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n59.  Socioeconomic  Profile.  The  Project  is located  in  a  poor  rural  area  predominantly \ninhabited by ethnic minorities. The Project will benefit 2.3 million people in Baise, of whom 87% \nlive in rural areas and 30% of these live on less than $1 per person per day.24 The project area \n                                                 \n23  The proposed toll rates are CNY0.40\u2013CNY1.68 per vehicle-km. Under the Guangxi provincial \u201cgreen passage\u201d \nregulations, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls. \n24 Per Baise Poverty Alleviation Office, 138,416 absolutely poor people live below CNY668 per capita per year and \n468,445 poor people live below CNY924 per capita per year. In total, 606,861 live well below the international \npoverty line of $1 per person per day (using purchasing power parity and measured in terms of consumption). \n ", "17\n   \nhas 1,184 administrative villages, of which 54% are classified as poverty villages. Rural poverty \nis  due  to  remote  and  isolated  locations,  low  education  and  technical  skills,  disease,  and \ndisability. Of the small urban population (13% of total), 11% are considered poor; urban poverty \nis primarily due to unemployment, old age, or disability. \n \n60.  Social Benefits. The construction of the expressway will shorten travel distance and \ntravel time, and relieve traffic congestion on NH324, which is the only main road for local \nresidents. Transportation improvements will promote local production of higher-value cash crops. \nUpgrading of 310 km of local roads will benefit 412,000 people, of which 30% are poor and 80% \nare ethnic minorities. Many rural villages still have poor access and may not benefit directly from \nthe Project. The results of the analysis in Guangxi II show that the average agricultural income \nin villages served by gravel roads was 35% higher than those for villages served by tracks, \nreflecting greater sales of agricultural produce made possible with better access to markets. For \nthis reason, GCD has agreed to (i) construct 50 township bus stations and (ii) upgrade 750 km \nof village roads, which will benefit 200\u2013400 poverty villages and 250,000 people, of which 50% \nare poor and 90% are ethnic minorities (Appendix 20). \n \n61.  Job and Skill Training Benefits. In addition to improved transport, the construction of \nthe expressway and rural roads will provide significant employment and skill training benefits. \nApproximately 53.1 million person-days will be required for expressway construction; 70% of \nthis labor is expected to be unskilled. At least 50% of the unskilled work will be sourced locally. \nThus, about 18.6 million person-days of local employment amounting to CNY318 million in \nwages will benefit local communities. About 70% of landscaping work and supplying daily \nnecessities can employ women. In total, 18,500 local residents will gain employment and skill \ntraining during project implementation.  \n \n62.  Control  and  Mitigation  of  Epidemic  Diseases. To address the risks of spreading \nHIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable  diseases,  implementation  of  the  following  measures  is \nrequired:  (i) health  screening  of  contract  and  migrant  workers  and  locally  hired  workers  for \nHIV/AIDS and other transmissible diseases (malaria and tuberculosis), (ii) awareness programs \nfor construction workers and local communities, (iii) monitoring of workers and possible cases \nduring construction; and (iv) a targeted awareness campaign at the start of expressway operation. \nInformation  will  be  also  provided  in  bus  stations,  service  areas,  and  border  crossings.  The \nmonitoring  will  be  implemented  by  the  Baise  Center  for  Disease  Control.  Guangxi  Health \nDepartment has been allocating additional funds to Baise to address their increasing needs. \nHealth, awareness, screening, and treatment requirements are stipulated in the standard contract \nbidding document, and compliance will be monitored regularly. The regional technical assistance, \nFighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific,25 will assist in developing and implementing effective \nmeasures for HIV/AIDS prevention in road transport in Guangxi and Yunnan. \n \n63.  Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (EMDP). Ethnic minorities in the project area \nmake  up  80.3%  of  the  total  population  and  comprise  87.7%  of  the  absolute  poor.  Ethnic \nminorities will be one of the primary beneficiaries of the Project. Some smaller groups such as \nthe Miao and Yao (6.7% and 5.3% of total, respectively) live in very isolated mountain areas and \ntend to be the poorest. Efforts will be made to target the Miao and Yao for enhancement \nmeasures,  including  provision  of  village  roads,  improved  bus  service,  skill  training,  and \nmicrocredit. Enhancement measures are specified in the EMDP; priority will be given to women \nto enhance direct and indirect project benefits and ensure protection against social risks such as \nHIV/AIDS. GCD will take the lead in assisting the concerned local agencies in implementing the \nEMDP with the support of Guangxi Ethnic Affairs Commission and its local offices (Appendix 21). \n                                                 \n25  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n ", "18 \n64.  Small Business Development. The Project will promote small business development in \ntwo aspects: (i) tourism and (ii) agricultural product trading. The Project will have direct impacts \nby reducing travel times and transport cost, improving rural roads that serve tourist sites, and \nconstructing two class-III bus stations in Jingxi county, which will enhance small business \ntrading near the border crossings (such as the livestock market in Naxi). Local governments will \nsupport small business development in the project area by providing financial resources for \nsmall business. The construction tax revenue to be collected by local governments is estimated \nat CNY240 million (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n65.  Beneficiary Participation. More than 5,000 people were interviewed during the public \nopinion  surveys,  social  and  environmental  assessments,  and  resettlement  planning \n(Supplementary Appendix J). Overall, local residents show strong support for the Project and \nwelcomed the opportunity to express their views. According to local residents, the greatest \nbenefit will be increased economic development in the area resulting in increased income \nsources and more job opportunities. Farmers have a keen understanding of the direct link \nbetween transport costs and farm profit margins, and expect lower freight costs and improved \naccess to benefit them directly. People also place emphasis on a cleaner environment with less \ndust, and easier and faster transport in general. Residents also state that improved roads would \nprovide better access for children traveling to schools and improve road safety. The consultation \nand participation process, including the needs of the poor and women, has influenced the \nproject design and alignment, and the formulation of the environment management plan (EMP), \nresettlement plans, and EMDP. \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment and Management Plan \n \n66.  ADB  classifies  the  Project  as  environment  category  A.  The  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  for  the  expressway  was  prepared  by  GCD  and  approved  by  the  State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration in October 2006. GCD prepared EIAs for Tianlin\u2013Leye \nand  Napo\u2013Dingye  local  roads;  these  were  approved  by  Guangxi  Environmental  Protection \nBureau in March 2007. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) were prepared for other local \nroads. For the bus stations and village roads, the sites and road sections will be selected during \nproject implementation. Environmental assessment review procedures were prepared as part of \nthe village road implementation framework (VRIF) (para. 37) and agreed with GCD. A summary \nEIA for the Project was endorsed by GCD, circulated to the ADB Board, and made public \nthrough  ADB\u2019s  website  on  9  April  2007.  The  EIAs,  IEEs,  and  summary  EIA  assess  the \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  selected  alignments  of  the  expressway,  local  roads,  and  bus \nstations; and prescribe environmental protection and mitigation measures costing $23 million. To \nensure that all potential adverse environmental impacts of the Project are mitigated, GCD will \nimplement  the  EMP  as  specified  in  the  EIAs,  IEEs,  and  summary  EIA.  The  EMP  will  be \nincorporated in the bidding documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nF.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n67.  This  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  project.  GCD  has  prepared  draft \nresettlement plans for the expressway and for the six local roads. For the bus stations and \nvillage roads, the sites or road sections will be identified during project implementation, a \nresettlement policy framework and procedural guidelines were prepared as part of the VRIF. \nResettlement information booklets were distributed to affected villages in March 2007. Based on \nthe Chinese standard for impact assessment, the equivalent of 6,030 people would lose all their \nland and agricultural livelihoods. Since the expressway will actually cross many parcels of \nscattered farmland, the average loss of land per household is estimated at 20%, which means \nthat about 30,150 people would be partially affected. About 1,568 households will be relocated. \n ", "19\n   \nLocal  government  will  implement  resettlement  with  supervision  by  GCD.  In  addition,  an \nindependent  agency  will  be  contracted  by  GCD  to  carry  out  the  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation. For land compensation, the expressway will apply national standards and the local \nroads  will  apply  provincial  regulations.  GCD  will  finance  the  cost  of  resettlement  for  the \nexpressway component. Local government will finance resettlement for other components with \npartial subsidy from GCD (Appendix 22). \n \nG.  Borrower Commitment, and Ownership \n \n68.  Central and provincial governments strongly support the Project, particularly the regional \nimpact, integrated design, participatory approach, and policy and instructional reform initiatives. \nOverall, the project preparatory team met more than 1,500 local residents during consultation \nmeetings  and  field  surveys.  GCD,  local  governments,  and  residents  express  tremendous \nsupport  and  emphasize  the  need  for  the  Project;  and  they  participated  in  the  project \nidentification  and  planning  process.  Current  government  program  (such  as  comprehensive \nvillage poverty reduction program) in the project area will be ongoing throughout the life of the \nProject.  Specific  objectives  of  the  government  program  include  improvements  to  living \nconditions of rural poor through improved rural infrastructure, training, micro credit, access to \ndrinking water, increased arable land, improved housing, and biogas facilities. The government \nprogram will complement activities undertaken by the Project, which provides an integrated \napproach for addressing poverty. \n \nH.  Risks \n \n69.  The project design has considered potential technical, financial, and social risks. The \nmain technical risks are associated with the design and construction of many bridges and \ntunnels. To minimize technical risks, (i) the Project will be implemented by experienced staff; \n(ii) preliminary  design  will  focus  on  detailed  geotechnical  investigations;  (iii)  international \nconsultants will help prepare a risk management plan; (iv) the bidding system will focus on \nfinancial  and  technical  capabilities  of  contractors  in  handling  similar  works;  (v)  a  contract \nmanagement information system will help identify technical problems and implement corrective \nmeasures on time; and (vi) given the safety hazards associated with bridge and tunnel works, \nthe contractors will be required to strictly enforce working safety rules and measures. To control \nthe financial risks, the Project will (i) strengthen contract management, (ii) inject more equity into \nthe Project, (iii) introduce a market-based approach to formulating tolls and regularly reviewing \ntoll rates to ensure cost recovery, and (iv) build a business environment to generate nontoll \nrevenues. Social issues include resettlement and HIV/AIDS infection. Appropriate mitigation \nmeasures are in place in the resettlement plans and EMDP. GCD demonstrated high ownership \nin preparing and committing to implement these action plans. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n70.

SWEC was created on 20 July 2005 to operate and maintain the roads under ADB\u2019s \nGuangxi Roads Development Project (Guangxi I) and Guangxi Roads Development Project II \n(Guangxi II). GCD now proposes to restructure and consolidate the expressway operations of \nGIAB,  GEAB,  and  SWEC  into  a  new  company\u2014GCIG\u2014either  as  operating  divisions  or \nsubsidiaries  of  GCIG.  GCD  will  complete  its  analysis  and  prepare  a  restructuring  plan  by \n31 October 2007, and a corporate development plan for GCIG by 31 March 2008. Thereafter, \nGCD will implement the restructuring plan in accordance with its terms, and incorporate and \ncommercialize GCIG by 30 June 2008. \n \n2.  Scope  of  Business.  The  primary  objective  of  GCIG  will  be  to  construct,  develop, \nmaintain, and operate the project expressway and other expressways, and select class-I and \nclass-II highways in Guangxi. GCIG will (i) have the right to collect tolls from users of the roads, \nin accordance with the terms and conditions of each concession granted to it; (ii) be authorized \n ", "34   Appendix 5 \nto retain toll and nontoll revenue in the business; and maintain full financial accounts of its \nassets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses; and (iii) have the right to engage in developing and \noperating other infrastructure projects such as toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and ancillary facilities, \nincluding property development along the toll roads in Guangxi and elsewhere in the PRC. \n \n3.  Capitalization. GCIG will be incorporated with an initial equity capital of CNY3 billion. \nGCIG will initially be registered as a solely state-owned company, and will explore possible \ncapital contributions from private investors, and on receipt of which, will convert itself into a joint \nstock company under the Company Law of the PRC. At least 6 months prior to the opening of \nthe expressway, GCIG will analyze the feasibility of accessing financing from the financial \nmarkets for future road sector investments, and possible private sector participation in O&M of \nthe project expressway; and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n4.  Corporate Governance. GCIG will have a board of directors with a minimum of 5 and \nmaximum of 19 directors. The board will have at least one director representing the employees, \nwho will be democratically elected in a general meeting of employee representatives. On receipt \nof  any  private  sector  investment,  GCIG  will  modify  its  articles  of  association  to  permit \nappointment of independent directors and directors representing other investors. \n \n5.  The board of directors will be responsible, inter alia, for determining the operation, \ninvestment, and financing plans; annual budgets; appointment of a manager for day-to-day \noperations;  and  developing  administrative  and  management  policies.  A  chairperson  and  a \ndeputy chairperson will be appointed from the members of the board and will not hold a \nconcurrent  post  in  any  other  limited  liability  company,  joint  stock  company,  or  economic \norganization. \n \n6.  GCIG  will  also  have  a  board  of  at  least  5  supervisors,  of  whom  employee \nrepresentatives will account for at least one third. The board of supervisors will have the right to \nscrutinize the financial affairs of the company; supervise the directors and senior managers; and \neven require their removal in the event of violation of any law, administrative regulation, or \narticles of association. \n \n7.  GCIG will appoint an external auditor to annually audit its financial reports in accordance \nwith the National Audit Law and the Company Law of the PRC. \n \n8.  Corporate Development Plan. A corporate development plan will be formulated to set \nstandards for corporate governance, management, financial reporting, and human resource \ndevelopment in GCIG by 31 March 2008. Comprehensive institutional development and training \nprograms will be implemented under the Project. This plan will involve (i) establishment of a \nmanagement structure and adoption of good corporate governance measures, (ii) organizational \nand  resource  development,  (iii)  creation  of  financial  and  administrative  systems,  and \n(iv) preparation of short- and long-term strategic business plans. \n \n9.  Concession Agreements. GCD will enter into concession agreements with GCIG for \nthe project expressway and other expressways in Guangxi. Such agreements will ensure that \nGCIG (i) bears the responsibility for construction, operation, and maintenance of the project \nexpressway  and  other  expressways  in  accordance  with  the  engineering,  technical,  social \nsafeguards  including  environmental,  and  highway  operation  and  maintenance  standards; \n(ii) complies with the required financial requirements, including the agreed financial performance \nratios; (iii) performs all other obligations in the ADB loan and project agreements to the extent \napplicable to it; and (iv) enjoys autonomy in construction, operating, and maintaining of the \nproject expressways. \n \n ", "    Appendix 6  35 \nRURAL TRANSPORT SERVICES AND POLICY REFORM \n \nA.  The Rural Transport System in Guangxi \n \n1.  Rationale. The project\u2019s transport services component comprises a program of building \nbus stations and introducing associated bus route improvements through licensing reforms. \nTogether with the expressway and rural road improvements, it will help establish an integrated \nrural transport service network and raise the accessibility of the areas served. Cheaper, more \nfrequent, more reliable, and safer transport services will improve access to jobs and education, \nand health and welfare services; raise incomes from the sale of produce; increase the range of \ngoods  and  services  available  locally;  and  improve  access  to  information  on  prices  and \nmarketing opportunities. As well as encouraging these service improvements, the bus stations \nwill themselves offer employment opportunities, create a market for small-scale traders (of food, \ndrinks,  etc.)  and  businesses  (e.g.,  vehicle  maintenance  and  repair),  improve  access  to \ninformation by public telephone, and provide better amenities for passengers. \n \n2.  Transport Services. In Guangxi, formal passenger services in rural areas are mostly by \n6\u20138-seat minibuses or 15\u201320-seat buses. They are licensed to stop only at designated places \nand stations, but few towns and none of the villages have stations, even simple stops. Where no \nformal services are available, the informal sector plays an important role, especially on poorer \nquality roads, but their safety standards are deficient and they are often more expensive than \nformal services. Generally, bus services are good along routes between county and township \ncenters, but do not exist between villages and are rare between villages and townships. Overall, \nin 2005, all townships had a formal service, but 580 administrative villages and 3,654 natural \nvillages in the project area did not have a formal service. \n \n3.  Regulatory Framework. Guangxi Transport Administration Bureau (GTAB) is the main \nagency involved in road transport administration in Guangxi. The bureau is responsible for \nregulating the road transport industry by licensing intercity bus services.1 County communications \nbureaus  are  responsible  for  the  regulation  of  road  transport  within  provinces.  Licensing \nconditions for bus services, routes, and stations are restrictive, requiring buses and drivers to be \nconfined to their authorized routes and schedules to be fixed by station operators. While freight \ntariffs are fully deregulated, passenger fares are allowed to vary within narrow bands around \nguideline rates set by Guangxi Communications Department (GCD). \n \n4.  Transport Demand and Users\u2019 Needs. Most trips in rural areas are to buy and sell \nproduce and for work. The average household in the project area makes 22 trips per annum to \ntheir nearest township and only 4 to their nearest county center; the poor travel much less. \nWhere formal services, which charge CNY0.10\u2013CNY0.20 per kilometer (km), are unavailable, \nfares on informal services are expensive: as much as CNY0.40\u2013CNY0.50 per km. Consequently, \nhalf of all trips by poor households are on foot (bicycles are unsuited to the mountainous terrain), \neven over distances of up to 14 km. On average, transport accounts for 4%\u20138% of household \nexpenses. For poor villages and those with poor road access, the proportion is much higher. To \nhelp reduce costs and encourage expansion of services, Guangxi discounts selected fees and \ntaxes for buses that have at least 20% of their route on roads of class IV or lower. Some \n6,798  buses benefited from this in 2006. \n \n5.  Issues and Priorities for Improvement. Bus productivity in the project area is very low: \n170 km per day on average for medium-sized buses and less than 30 km per day for small \nbuses, according to official statistics. This reflects low demand, poor roads, and inefficient \nscheduling of vehicles; in turn a function of long waiting times at stations and inability to rotate \n                                                 \n1  City bus services are the responsibility of the regional agencies of the Ministry of Construction. \n ", "36   Appendix 6 \nbuses onto other routes. Unit costs are consequently high. In addition to extending the network \nof formal services into villages, the cost of rural services needs to be lowered by raising vehicle \nand driver productivity and providing users with more frequent services and a wider range of \nchoices. Safety needs to be increased by bringing more of the network under the control of \nsafety regulations. \n \nB.  Rural Transport Services Component \n \n6.  Township Bus Stations. The Project will support the construction of 48 class-V and \n2 class-III township bus stations (Map 3). The main criteria include that the new station will (i) be \nin accordance with GCD\u2019s 11th Five-Year Program; (ii) help develop bus services in areas also \nbenefiting from the Project\u2019s expressway and rural road components, i.e., contribute to an \nintegrated solution to the needs of communities in the project area; (iii) help improve access to \npoorer villages and townships in the project area; and (iv) serve as a focus for bus services \noperating  between  townships  and  surrounding  villages.  The  layout  and  design  of  the  bus \nstations will not be standardized but vary with local circumstances, provided that they comply \nwith a basic set of functional principles. \n \n7.  Each  bus  station  will  provide  ancillary  facilities  for  small-scale  businesses  where \nappropriate after consultations with local communities and potential operators. The two class-III \nstations are in Longbang and Yuexu to help facilitate cross-border trade and development of \nlocal businesses and employment. The locations of both are near the center of town and closely \nintegrated with planned border trade markets and freight interchange facilities. The component \nis projected to cost CNY27.6 million ($3.6 million), of which $1.4 million will be financed by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) loan (Table A6). The remaining cost will be financed by the \nMinistry  of  Communications,  local  governments,  and/or  the  private  sector.  Each  will  be \nmanaged by bus or station operators following tender. The investors selected by competitive \nbidding will have the opportunity to include additional commercial facilities within the design.  \n \nTable A6: Estimated Cost of Rural Bus Stations  \n    Unit Cost  Cost  Cost  ADB Financing  Total ADB Financing \nStandard  No.  (CNY million)  (CNY million)  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million) \nClass V  48  0.5  24  3.1  40  1.20 \nClass III    2  1.8  3.6  0.5  40  0.20 \nTotal  50    27.6  3.6    1.40 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, No. = number. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n8.  Bus  Route  Licensing  Reform.  The  Ministry  of  Communications  issued  the  Road \nPassenger Transport and Terminal Regulation in August 2005 allowing the communications \nbureaus some flexibility in issuing regional rather than fixed-route licenses for rural services. \nHowever, the following restrictions remain: (i) specific buses are designated for licensed routes, \nthereby restricting their use on other routes (thus limiting opportunities for improved utilization \nthrough inter-working); (ii) licensed routes must have one end in a terminal (thus limiting the \nextension of services into rural areas with no terminals); and (iii) licensing of bus routes on \nunclassified roads where many of the isolated poor live is restricted.  \n \n9.  ADB  has  had  extensive  dialogue  on  how  to  improve  the  performance  of  transport \nservices in the project area. Guangxi was selected as one of the case study provinces in the \nSustainable Rural Transport Services technical assistance (TA) in 2006.2 The TA reviewed the \ncurrent issues in providing rural road transport services and recommended reforms to help \nestablish more demand-responsive services between townships and nearby villages. Under the \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Sustainable Rural Transport Services. \nManila. \n ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nProject, GCD and local transport authorities agree to implement township/village bus route \nlicensing reforms in Baise. This will allow some flexibility for operators to adjust their services in \nline with passenger needs and use their vehicles and drivers more productively. \n \n10.  Pilot Demonstration Project. The proposed reforms of rural transport services will be \ndemonstrated and tested by means of a pilot demonstration project in Baise to ensure that they \nare workable before an attempt is made to introduce the reforms throughout the country. The \npilot project involves establishing a township-based bus cooperative or rural bus company \nbased at a township within the city. The bus company or cooperative will hold a license for \nvillage bus routes with freedom to select bus sizes and allocate buses to routes according to \ndemand, with clear incentives to optimize bus utilization. The pilot project will \n \n(i)  demonstrate how the proposed reforms to village bus services would operate; \n(ii)  involve all stakeholders in designing and monitoring the effectiveness of the \nvillage bus service system; \n(iii)  draft documents and procedures needed to plan, issue, and monitor operations \nunder the recommended system; \n(iv)  identify the training needed to establish the necessary planning and regulatory \nskills in the communication bureaus; and \n(v)  identify any problems and shortcomings, and adjust the proposed arrangements \ngiven practical experience. \n \n11.  GCD will oversee implementation and monitoring of the pilot project (Box A6). The \ncommunications bureau will be responsible for its day-to-day management. Overall direction will \nbe given by a steering committee chaired by the director of Guangxi Transport Administration \nBureau. Under the pilot project, a network of county-based routes extending to the villages \nbeyond a given township will be replaced by a village bus service based in the township. The \nholder of the township-based village bus route licenses will be a local company or cooperative \nformed by local bus or minibus owners. The pilot project will help formulate this group, and \nprovide training for new operators in basic management techniques, bus service planning and \noperations, and safety. ADB will provide $160,000 to implement the pilot project.  \n \n \nBox A6: Action Plan for the Pilot Demonstration Project \n \n \n  \u2022  Establish a project implementation group, chaired by Guangxi Transport Administration Bureau, to oversee \n  the project briefings and consultations with all parties affected, including bus and taxi operators, informal \n  operators, local business groups, and local leaders and their communities. \n\u2022  Select a suitable group to operate the village bus routes, and brief them on the proposals, carrying out \n \ndemand surveys, and providing training and simple management tools. \n \n\u2022  Draft the necessary decrees and dispensations to enable the pilot project to proceed and to authorize the \n  participation of the public sector stakeholders. \n  \u2022  In consultation with the operators, select the routes for the village bus network, and define stopping places. \n  \u2022  Draft the village bus route license conditions, and issue temporary licenses to the group chosen to operate \nthe route. \n \n\u2022  Draft the conditions for a village bus license, and issue temporary licenses to bus owners who wish to join the \n \ngroup holding the village bus route licenses. \n \n\u2022  Clarify the role and procedures of the communications bureau in relation to the village bus services, including \n  planning/designing village routes; canvassing for interest from potential operators; helping with the formation \n  of operating groups; setting conditions for village bus route licenses; adjusting route structures if necessary; \nand monitoring operations to safeguard the interests of operators, users, and the general public. \n \n\u2022  Evaluate  the  results  of  the  pilot  project,  circulate  these  for  discussion  and  review  among  county \n \ncommunications bureaus, Guangxi Communications Department, and Ministry of Communications; and draft \n \ndetailed guidelines and revisions to the draft decrees to enable implementation throughout the country. \n   \n  Sources: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank. \n ", "38  Appendix 7 \nROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT \n \n1.

According to official statistics, in 2006 the country recorded 378,781 traffic accidents \nwith 89,455 fatalities; the number of deaths might have been greater if unrecorded accidents \nwere included. At 3 recorded deaths per 1,000 vehicles, the PRC\u2019s accident rate is high by \ninternational standards; Guangxi records 6 deaths per 1,000 vehicles. In response, the Ministry \nof Public Security\u2019s Road Safety Action Plan is to facilitate implementation of the 2004 Road \nSafety Law by improving vehicle safety, driver training, and traffic management. The accident \nrates have started to fall. In 2006. Guangxi reported 8,895 road accidents, 3,016 fatalities, and \n11,336 injuries, down from 17%, 14%, and 10% in 2005. \n \n2.  Like other provinces in the PRC, Guangxi Public Security Bureau (GPSB) and Guangxi \nCommunications Department (GCD) are the main institutions involved in road safety. GPSB is \nresponsible for vehicle testing and licensing, driver training and testing, law enforcement and \neducation,  treatment,  and  collection  of  accident  data.  GCD  is  responsible  for  design, \nconstruction, and maintenance of highways; as well as installation and maintenance of road \ntraffic  signs  and  markings.  The  safety  work  is  coordinated  between  GPSB  and  GCD,  but \ncooperation between GPSB and GCD is not strong and needs strengthening. The Project will \nhelp  share  road  safety  information;  identify  the  relationship  between  accidents  and  road \nconditions;  as  well  as  improve  detection,  education,  and  enforcement.  GPSB  will  conduct \neducation campaigns targeting communities through lectures and publicity materials developed \nunder the Asian Development Bank Road Safety Improvement technical assistance.1 \n \n \n  Box A7: Road Safety Improvement Program \n   \n  \u2022  Signs and Markings. Speed limit signs will be placed at 0.2 kilometer (km) after the end of each interchange \nentry taper, with repeaters on the main expressway at approximately 20 km intervals and proposed for all \n \ntunnels. Signage warns of tiredness, drunk driving, and rear-end collisions; and indicates the safe driving \n \ndistance between vehicles. The use of thermoplastic paint is recommended for road markings and reflected \n  road studs are to be mounted along the centerline of the road as well as at the carriageway edges to reduce \n  wandering of vehicles at night. Variable message signs will be used on the expressway. \n \n \n\u2022  Controlling Overloading of Vehicles. This is essential to reduce pavement damage and increase road \n  safety because of (i) higher demands on vehicle braking systems, chassis strength, and flexibility; (ii) vehicle \n  stability when rounding curves; and (iii) steering difficulties resulting from heavy rear-end loads. To control \noverloading, in coordination with Guangxi Public Security Bureau, Guangxi Communications Department \n \n(GCD) will implement weight-based tolling for all expressways and parallel toll highways by 31 December \n \n2007. \n   \n\u2022  Black-Spot Treatment Pilot Program. Systematic black-spot analysis and treatments have proved to \n \neffectively improve road safety. GCD agrees to carry out a special black-spot program under the Project. A \n \nspecial black-spot group will be established in Guangxi and trained under the Project by an international \n  consultant for about 1.5 months during the first year of project implementation. They will fix the black spots \n  identified along national highway (NH) 324. During the second year, the consultants will return for a half \n  month to make sure the group can identify and analyze black spots, and carry out work in control sites along \nNH324; and provide guidance as needed. After completion of the pilot program, the black-spot work will be \n \ncontinued as a part of GCD\u2019s normal regular traffic safety maintenance work. The personnel who participated \n \nin the pilot black-sport work will be responsible for training the relevant personnel in city and county \n  communication bureaus. \n   \n\u2022  Road Safety Audit. The following areas need particular attention to achieve road safety improvement in \n  Guangxi,  e.g.,  safety  in  work  zones,  safety  audit  procedures  for  improved  road  management, speed \nmonitoring and control, tunnel construction and operation, truck and bus safety, and control of overloaded \nvehicles. The Project will conduct road safety audit reviews and make recommendations in these areas. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Increasing the number of vehicles and vehicle kilometers traveled has raised concern \nabout local air pollution and global warming. Major vehicle emission are carbon monoxide (CO), \ncarbon  dioxide  (CO ),  hydrocarbon  (HC),  nitrogen  oxides  (NO ),  sulfur  oxides  (SO ),  and \n2 x x\nsuspended particulate matters (SPM). CO, HC, NO , SO , and SPM cause local air pollution and \nx x\nhealth issues, and CO  increases global warming and causes climate change. Improvement of \n2\ntraffic efficiency and vehicle quality could decrease all vehicle emissions. The major pollutants \nto be measured to by the Project are CO, CO , HC, SO , NO , and SPM. The amount of \n2 x x\nreduction of CO, CO , HC, and NO  at project level were assessed. \n2 x\n \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n2.  Reduction of NO , HC, CO, and CO  was estimated by comparing the case with and \nx 2\nwithout the Project. Without the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing road, which will \nbe  more  congested,  engines  will  consume  more  fuel  and  produce  more  pollutants  by \ndecelerating, accelerating, and driving at very slow speed. With the Project, traffic will benefit \nfrom shorter distance, optimal alignment, and less congestion. Vehicles will operate efficiently at \nhigh speed without stop-and-go, which will result in lower fuel consumption and less emission of \npollutants. The estimation of vehicle emissions is based on the relationship of fuel consumption, \nemission of pollutants, and vehicle average speed.  \n \n3.  For the first operating year, fuel conservation for passenger and freight vehicles in the \ncorridor is estimated to be more than 11,000 tons oil equivalent (toe) with a total saving of \n982,000 toe over the 20-year forecast period, or 25% lower than without the Project. In addition, \nit will result in the reduction of pollutants emission of 39,000 ton of carbon dioxide (CO ), with a \n2\ntotal  reduction  of  CO   by  4.7  million  tons  over  the  20-year  forecast  period.  Guangxi \n2\nEnvironmental Protection Board will monitor emissions on project roads (Table A8.1). \n \nTable A8.1: Estimated Vehicle Emission Reduction in the Project Corridor  \n(ton oil equivalent) \nItem  2012  2032  2012\u20132032 \nFuel Savings  11,000   89,000   982,000  \nReduced CO  Emission  39,000   450,000   4,700,000  \n2\n  Sources: Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau and Guangxi Public Security Bureau. \n \n4.  Guangxi  Province  adheres  to  national  vehicle  emission  control  strategies  including \n(i) enforcing national emission standards for new vehicles; (ii) improving conventional fuels; \n(iii) legislating the use of alternative or cleaner fuels; (iv) increasing vehicle inspection and \nmaintenance programs; and (v) using the national regulated requirement for the retirement of \nobsolete polluting vehicles. Table A8.2 provides an integrated plan developed to help agencies \nreduce vehicle emissions in Guangxi and the project area. \n \n5.  Vehicle  emission  enforcement  administration  for  operating  vehicles  requires  good \ncoordination among agencies: Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau and Guangxi Public \nSecurity Bureau. But these agencies have little dialog on this issue. The Project will catalyze \nsuch  cooperation.  The  two  bureaus  will  provide  checkpoints  for  vehicle  emissions  in \nstrategically planned locations. For example, two checkpoints will be established on the Tainlin\u2013\nLeye local road. \n \n ", "40   Appendix 8 \nTable A8.2: Strategic Vehicle Emission Reduction Plan: Targets and Expected Outputs \n      Expected  Responsible \nTarget  Proposed Action  Schedule  Output  Agency \n1.

The project expressway is located in the northwest of Guangxi. Most of the alignment is \nmountainous with altitudes of 100\u2013800 meters (m) and natural gradient of over 20 degrees. The \nexpressway will be a 177 kilometer (km), four-lane access-controlled tollway from Baise to the \nborder with Guizhou province in Longlin county, which is one of the high priority east\u2013west \ncorridors in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The expressway connects at the south with the \nNanning\u2013Baise Expressway and at the north with the planned Guizhou\u2013Kunming expressway in \nXingyi city. It will go through the Youjiang district of Baise, Tianlin, and Longlin counties. The \nfollowing paragraphs describe the alternatives considered. \n \n2.  Do-Nothing  Alternative.  The  do-nothing  option  would  require  traffic  to  use,  as  at \npresent, the existing road, national highway 324. This highway is already operating at close to \ncapacity and would require substantial upgrading, first to a divided class-II standard to carry \nprojected normal growth traffic, and then by 2022 to class-I or expressway standard. Upgrading \nthe existing road would require significant realignment to provide adequate capacity and reduce \nroadside friction, especially in the northern section, and require the upgrading of many bridges \nand tunnels. The tunnels and bridges would have to be constructed to class-I or expressway \nstandard initially to prevent major expensive upgrading later. The combined cost of initial and \nlater upgrading of the road could well approach the cost of the new expressway, while providing \nan  inferior  alignment  but  involving  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  decreased \nsafety, and less total capacity. For this reason, the do-nothing option is not recommended. \n \n3.  Road Class Analysis. The option of constructing a road of lower technical class instead \nof the project expressway was considered but rejected for the following reasons: (i) The only \nroad classes with the capacity to carry traffic up to 2022 are four-lane expressway or class-I \nhighway. (ii) The major difference between the expressway and class-I highway according to \nMinistry of Communications (MOC) design standard is that class-I highway may be only partly \naccess-controlled  whereas  an  expressway  must  be  fully  access-controlled.  Thus,  the \nconstruction costs differ only in the number and types of access control by overpass or grade \nseparation, which accounts for about 3%\u20135% of the total cost. (iii) Reducing access control and \ngrade separation reduces capacity and safety. \n \n4.  Road  Capacity  and  Service.  In  accordance  with  the  new  MOC  highway  design \nstandard, the road capacity for design speed of 80 km/hour is 25,000\u201345,000 passenger car \nunits (pcu) per day, and for 100 km/hour 35,000\u201350,000 pcu per day under ideal conditions.1 As \nfor the capacity for the project expressway, the following adjustment factors need to taken into \nconsideration:  (i)  lane width  and/or  lateral  clearance  restriction;  (ii)  the  presence  of  heavy \nvehicles in the traffic steam; (iii) the development environment and type of multilane highway, \nand (iv) driver population. In addition, level of service is an important factor as it has a close \nrelation with road capacity. Following the standard set by MOC, the expressway service should \nreach class II (equivalent to United States class C) at the end of the forecast year.  \n \n5.  Two design speeds were adopted taking into account the topographical and geological \ncondition and traffic volume for the main expressway, namely: 80 km/hour from Guizhou border \nkm 0 to km 114, and 100 km/hour for km 114 to km 177 (Baise). The traffic projection for the \nfirst section is 30,000 average annual daily traffic (AADT) passenger car units and for the latter \n                                                 \n1  Ideal conditions include: (i) level terrain, (ii) 3.75 m lane widths, (iii) a minimum of 0.75 lateral clearance between \nthe edge of travel lanes and obstructions at the roadside, (iv) 2.75 m hard road shoulder, (v) passenger cars only in \nthe traffic stream, and (vi) a divided highway cross section. \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \nsection 32,000; both are within the range of class-II to class-III service under different design \nspeed at the end of the projection year (Table A9). \n \nTable A9: Road Capacity and Level of Service \nDesign Speed   100 kilometers/hour  80 kilometers/hour \nLevel of Service         LOS II  LOS III       LOS IV  LOS II        LOS III       LOS IV \nV/C (MOC standard)  0.67  0.86  1  0.6  0.75  1 \nMSF(MOC standard)  1,400  1,800  2,100  1,200  1,500  2,000 \nSF  2,179   2,802   3,268   1,868   2,335   3,113 \nAADT  31,034   40,325   49,522   26,601   33,605   47,164 \nAADT= annual average daily traffic, LOS = level of service, MSF = maximum service flow rate (pcu/hour/lane),       \npcu = passenger car unit, SF = service flow rate under the prevailing roadway and traffic condition in pcu per hour, \nV/C = volume/capacity. \nSources: Guangxi Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  Alignment Alternatives. The recommended expressway alignments were selected after \nin-depth analysis of four schemes based on developing local economies, coordinating with the \nhighway network; avoiding areas with complex geological conditions; and minimizing social and \nenvironmental impacts, and agriculture land acquisition. The technical features of the project \nexpressway are described in Box A9. \n \nBox A9: Technical Features of the Project Expressway \n \nTechnical  Standards.  Two  technical  standards  were  adopted  due  to  complex  topographic  and \ngeologic conditions along the route: (i) km 0 to km 114, the design speed is 80 km/hour and subgrade \nwidth 24.5 m; (ii) km 114 to km 177, the design speed is 100 km/hour and subgrade width 26 m. \n \nStructures. The expressway includes (i) 214 bridges with total length of about 64 km (36% of total \nlength); and (ii) 11 unidirectional, 4-lane tunnels with total length of about 7 km (4% of total length). \n \nPavement. Asphalt concrete pavement is recommended except for tunnels and toll plazas where \ncement concrete will be utilized, with an 18-centimeter (cm) asphalt surface, a 60 cm cement stabilized \nbase and subbase, and a 15 cm graded aggregate subgrade capping layer. This pavement thickness \nshould be adequate to withstand the high proportion of heavy vehicles in the traffic flow. \n \nInterchanges  and  Facilities. The expressway has 10 interchanges over 177 km; spacing is a \nminimum of 9 km and a maximum of 30 km; four service areas provide facilities for refueling and \nvehicle repair; restaurants; three rest areas for parking and resting; nine toll stations at interchange \nramps; and one mainline toll station at the border with Guizhou. Electrical and mechanical equipment \nfor tolling, traffic monitoring, and telecommunications will be installed. \n \nConnector Roads. The Project includes the improvement of seven class-II connecting roads with a \ntotal length of 27 km. They will link the expressway interchanges to Longlin (22.1 km), Bianya (0.9 km), \nShali (1.5 km), Juizhou (0.8 km), Bantao (0.35 km), Xiatang (0.45 km), and Baise (0.65 km) thereby \nintegrating the expressway to major towns and local highway network. \n \nConstruction  Supervision.  A  joint  international-national  team  will  supervise  implementation. \nInternational experts will assist the chief supervision officer and support national firms in managing, \nsupervising, and monitoring project contracts. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  43 \nLOCAL ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM \n \n1.  Objective. The main objective of the Local Road Improvement Program is to help \nreduce poverty in the project area by providing and improving all-weather access to the rural \npopulation. Under this program, the Project will rehabilitate and upgrade 1,060 kilometers (km) \nof local roads in seven counties and Youjiang district of Baise. The program will result in lower \ntransport costs (for people and goods), and provide all-year access to the affected communities. \nFurthermore, this should improve access of rural people to social services such as education \nand health. In addition, the provision of such access will increase employment opportunities, \nparticularly during construction and for ongoing maintenance. \n \n2.  Poverty and Isolation. The program addresses the lack of basic access in remote and \npoor counties in the project area. Of the 1,184 villages in the project area, 633 (54%) are \ndesignated as poor, and 592 (50%) of these have no basic road access. Various surveys \nconducted  during  project  preparation  provide  evidence  that  poverty  is  more  pervasive  in \n\u201cunconnected\u201d areas, that is areas with no or unreliable motorized access. For example, in Leye \ncounty, where 48% of the residents are living below the poverty line, 65% are without basic \naccess (Table A10.1). \n \nTable A10.1: Lack of Basic Road Access in the Project Area \nCounty  Youjiang  Tianyang  Jingxi  Lingyun  Leye  Tianlin  Longlin  Xilin  Total \nPoverty Villages  38  50  168  67  52  97  106  55  633 \nNumber of Villages  108  152  291  110  86  165  179  93  1,184 \n% of Poverty Villages  \n(Average)  35  33  58  61  60  59  59  59  53 \n% of Poverty \nIncidence (Average)  20.0  20.0  22.0  41.0  48.0  42.0  27.0  55.0  34 \n% of Without Basic \nAccess (Average)  29.0  70.0  57.0  24.0  65.0  61.0  56.0  47.0  51 \n                   \nSources: Guangxi and Baise poverty alleviation and development offices, and Guangxi Communications Department. \n \n3.

Integrated Poverty Reduction Efforts. Guangxi has gained useful experiences under \nthe recently completed Southwest Poverty Reduction Project financed by the World Bank. It \nshows that the best means of assisting poor is to take an integrated approach to helping areas \nexperiencing severe poverty. ADB has been improving on previous interventions by introducing \na participatory approach to project design, and addressing a range of problems in the project \narea by working in collaboration with Guangxi Poverty Alleviation and Development Office \nthroughout  design  and  implementation.  The  local  road  maximizes  the  benefits  of  the \nexpressway component of the Project, i.e., to provide improved links to the expressway, and \nhelps maximize the beneficial impact of the Project as a whole on people in poverty in the \nproject  area.  Thus,  the  two  components  of  the  Project\u2014expressway  and  local  roads\u2014act \ntogether to reduce poverty. The expressway reduces costs and improves access to the markets \nalong the corridor; the rural road improvements help spread the associated economic and social \nbenefits to the most remote and disadvantaged (Box A10). \n \nBox A10: Poverty Reduction Impacts of the Local Roads \n \nDe\u2019e\u2013Shali Road (106 km). This road starts from the Shali expressway interchange and retains the existing \nalignment up to the Xilin\u2013Longlin border. The area is mainly mountainous with elevations ranging from 700 to \n1,600 meters and road conditions are very poor. In Longlin, the road travels through five towns and serves over \n50 villages with a population of more than 100,000, 26% of whom are poor. Guangxi Poverty Alleviation and \nDevelopment Office (GPAO) is assisting farmers to diversify into high-value produce such as tobacco. The main \nconcern of villagers is the road condition, the problems it causes for transporting crops, and its impact on higher \nprices paid for agricultural inputs. In Dalan village, where the main crop of tobacco must be transported to the \ntobacco company station at Longhuo, the road condition is too poor for truck transport so tractors, animal carts, or \nthe village minibus must be used to transport the crop. From 10 to 15 tractor loads equal one truck load. The road \nis too bad to transport pigs to market so they must be sold to an intermediary at a lower price. Road conditions \ncause too much spoilage to exploit surplus fruit and vegetable production. The improved road will also provide \nalternate access to Xilin and Longlin county towns and surrounding area, thus improving the overall transport \nsystem.  \n \nTianlin\u2013Leye Road (117 km). In addition to connecting the two counties of Tianlin and Leye, the road provides \naccess to six towns and 64 villages. Tianlin has a population of over 240,000 of which 42% are poor. The ethnic \nminority population is 175,000, of which 45% are poor. Leye has a population of 157,000; the poverty rate is 48%, \nwith 11% designated as absolute poor. Given the considerable agricultural activities along the road, local \nresidents depend on the road to move products from fields to distant towns. The road is very dusty in summer and \nimpassible in the rainy season because of the clay bound macadam pavement and poor drainage system. In its \npresent condition, the road results in unhealthy air quality as well as unsafe driving conditions due to the extreme \ndust, and landslide and mud conditions. Road accidents are frequent and serious (41 traffic accidents on this road \nsection in 2005). More than 80% of Tianlin county\u2019s rice is grown by villages in this area and GPAO is \nencouraging farmers to diversify into high-value fruit products as well as mulberries, and is providing intensive \ntraining for silkworm production. The area produces many high-value specialty items such as persimmons, prickly \nash, bamboo, oil seed, tea oil, chestnuts, and ginger along with other high quality vegetables. The improved road \nwill (i) reach the isolated Leye communities that are quite distant from the main road network and where road \nconditions are very poor, (ii) reduce traffic accidents along the road, and (iii) eliminate the dust that plagues \nroadside communities for 6\u20137 months of the year. \n \nVillage Access Roads (750 km). The Project includes upgrading of 750 km of village access roads to poor \nnatural villages mainly in mountainous areas. In general, these villages are served only by rough tracks, which are \nusable only by foot and animal traffic, and so the current level of accessibility and mobility of villagers is very low. \nShortage of natural village access roads has made daily trips to school and health care facilities difficult. Access \nto health services is a serious concern. In Tianlin, farmers from a village without basic roads told the story of \ncarrying a sick man for 3 days in an attempt to get him to hospital but he died along the route. The results of the \nsurveys show that poor people in the project area recognize isolation as a major contributor to their poverty and \nmarginalization. Providing village access roads is considered essential to promote rural development, to increase \nuptake of human development services (educational and health), to facilitate inclusion of different ethnic and other \ngroups, to improve employment opportunities, and to stimulate growth for poverty reduction. It will allow villagers \nmotorized transport access to markets, reducing costs and allowing changes to cropping patterns. Village access \nroads will integrate the targeted efforts by GPAO and adopt a more demand-driven approach: road sections will \nbe chosen in the course of project implementation.  \n \nSources: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank. \n ", "  Appendix 11  45 \nREGIONAL COOPERATION AND CROSS-BORDER TRADE \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.  Guangxi\u2019s Trade with Viet Nam. Trade between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand Viet Nam increased from $8.2 billion in 2005 to $9.9 billion by 2006, i.e., 21%. The PRC is \nViet Nam\u2019s second-largest trading partner; excluding Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, \nit accounted for 12.6% of trade in 2005. Small-scale border trade between Viet Nam and \nGuangxi, within administrative districts on both sides and no more than 20 km from the border, \ngrew by 50% to $1 billion in 2006. Three provinces in Viet Nam\u2019s northeast region are adjacent \nto Guangxi\u2014Quang Ninh, Lang Son, and Cao Bang, with a population of 2.33 million in 2005\u2014\nare among the poorest in Viet Nam. Support for developing cross-border trade will contribute to \npro-poor economic growth in western Guangxi and northern Viet Nam. \n \n2.  Regional  Cooperation.  Regional  cooperation  is  strongly  supported  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) 2006 strategy for regional economic cooperation and integration,1 \nand strategy and program for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which includes goals of \nfacilitating cross-border movements and tourism, and integrating markets to promote economic \nefficiency and private sector development. The PRC and Viet Nam cooperate under GMS \ninitiatives; Guangxi joined the GMS in 2004. The GMS strategic framework for action on trade \nfacilitation  and  investment  covers  four  key  activities:  customs  procedures,  inspection  and \nquarantine  measures,  trade  logistics,  and  mobility  of  people.  The  GMS  countries  are \nimplementing provisions of the Cross Border Transport Agreement to simplify and harmonize \ncross-border transport procedures and promote integrated logistics. \n \n3.  Border Trading Ports. Four main crossings of Guangxi\u2019s 637 km border with Viet Nam \nare at Dongxing, Pingxiang, Shuikou, and Longbang, all national class-I land ports through \nwhich international transport is authorized. In addition, there are seven class-II land ports, as \nwell  as  25  border  trade  markets.  Regional  trade  through  Youyiguan  will  benefit  from  the \nproject\u2019s improved expressway connections to/from Yunnan, Guizhou, and areas further west \nand north and associated facilities. Two of the others, Longbang (class I) and Yuexu (class-II), \nwill benefit from upgraded rural roads upgraded, which will establish good-quality links to the \nproject expressway via Jingxi, Debao, Tianyang, and Baise; and serve border trade flows \nto/from Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and beyond. Passenger services to/from Longbang and \nYuexu will be improved by a program of bus stations and bus route reforms.  \n \nB.  Project Components \n \n4.  Aside from providing the missing link in the Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi transport corridor, \nthe Project includes components with strong GMS dimensions, i.e., (i) provision of facilities and \nequipment to meet expected demands for freight transshipment and storage at the Wantong \nLogistics  Center  in  Pingxiang  (para.  5),  (ii)  border  road  improvement  for  trade  activities \n(Box A11);  and  (iii)   bus  station  (para.  6)  and  pilot  bus  route  licensing  improvements \n(Appendix 6), which will improve the efficiency and quality of bus services. \n \n5.  Trade Facilitation at Pingxiang. Discussions are under way between the governments \nof  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  to  expand  the  existing  bilateral  road  transport  agreement  on \nexchanges  of  traffic  rights  along  the  Nanning\u2013Hanoi  corridor.  Agreement  is  expected  by \n31 December 2007. The opening of the Wantong Logistics Center in October 2006 at Pingxiang \nprovided a major impetus to cross-border trade along the Nanning\u2013Hanoi corridor, one of the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \nkey GMS economic corridors. Two project preparation surveys were carried out in Youyiguan \nand Longbang in September 2006 to collect concerns and suggestions of potential users of \nborder trade facilities. Based on the user need surveys, a list of trade logistics facilities and \nequipment  was  selected  and  agreed  with  Guangxi  Communication  Department.2 ADB  will \nfinance the total cost of equipment and transport information system estimated at $10 million. It \nwill facilitate efficient transshipment throughput at the Logistics Center, lowering handling costs \nand reducing transshipment delays for goods crossing the border. \n \n \nBox A11: Border Roads Improvement for Trade Activities \n \n \n \nJingxi-Longbang Road. Along Jingxi county\u2019s 152 km border with Viet Nam are Longbang class-I land port; \n \nYuexu class-II port; and four border markets in Longbang, Yuexu, Xinxing, and Mengma. The current poor and \n  low capacity of the existing Jingxi\u2013Longbang road cannot meet the demands of the increasing traffic, both local \n  and cross-border. The road upgrading is to serve traffic using the land ports and border markets. It will integrate \n  the transport system in the area with planned development of the land port. Improved access to international \ntrade at Longbang and Yuexu will pass on the benefits of reduced travel costs on the expressway to poor \n \ncounties in the project area, simulate border trade, and create employment opportunities. \n   \n  Naxi (Longbang) Border Market Access Road. The road section near Longbang passes through Naxi village, \n  the site of Guangxi\u2019s only livestock border market, trading some 300 head of cattle, horses, goats, and pigs each \nday, mostly benefiting small-scale producers. Jingxi has plans to expand this facility, almost doubling its capacity. \n \nIn addition, some 1,000 small-scale traders cross the border every day, trading agricultural produce, utensils, \n \npoultry, livestock, fruit, timber, etc. with people from adjacent Vietnamese townships. Jingxi has approval for a \n  plan to develop a border trade street at the Naxi border, to provide improved facilities for traders and help \n  generate local employment. The Project is expected to increase annual border trade by CNY100 million, raise \n  CNY10 million per annum in taxes and tariffs, and increase local incomes by CNY5 million. Thus upgrading of this \nroad is crucial to local development. \n \n \n  Yuexu Border Access Road. The road is located at a class-II land port opposite Pobiao port in Viet Nam. Trade \n  is mostly in cement, animal feed, manganese, herbs, and foodstuffs. An estimated 50,000 people cross the \n  border each year, mostly small-scale traders exchanging agricultural goods, foodstuffs, and consumer products. \nThis will increase substantially when the planned new border freight station is constructed and the Vietnamese \n \nfinish upgrading their road to Trung Khanh. The road will serve small-scale cross-border traffic and the new \n \ntransshipment facility to be constructed behind the present border post. \n \n \n \n6.  Bus Stations. To facilitate cross-border trade, the Project includes two class-II bus \nstations at Longbang and Yuexu, which currently do not have formal bus stations. Buses stop at \nthe roadside, interrupting traffic and market activities and posing a safety risk. At Longbang, at \nthe end of the route, buses have difficulty turning for their return journey and have no off-street \nspace to wait for passengers. The proposed location of Longbang bus station is close to the \ncenter  of  town,  near  the  existing border  crossing  and  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations Free Trade Area (AFTA) being developed to handle export traffic. The proposed Yuexu \nbus  station  is  adjacent  to  Yuexu  town  center  and  will  be  integrated  with  a  major  freight \ntransshipment facility and border trade market. Experience in Guangxi has been that transport \nservices respond to road improvements, with bus operators taking advantage of better access \nto areas of potential demand. This is expected to result in more trade and investment, better \ninformation on market opportunities, and higher incomes for the poor. \n \n                                                 \n2  The Youyiguan survey (included both Chinese and Vietnamese) showed a significant demand for improved cargo-\nhandling facilities (72%), truck major repairs (54%), and warehousing (50%). Interest in parking facilities (46%), \nopen storage (41%), and temperature-controlled storage (21%) was high. Equipment with higher capacity (35% \nover 15 tons, 55% over 20 tons) was preferred over those of less than 15 tons (10%). \n ", "  Appendix 12  47 \nRURAL ROAD MAINTENANCE POLICY REFORM \n \n1.  Existing  Situation.  Adequate  and  timely  maintenance  is  important  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of rural roads. In Guangxi, county communication bureaus are responsible for rural \nroads maintenance, and the quality of rural roads is periodically monitored by city and provincial \nhighway administration bureau. In Baise, county roads in good condition account for 62% of the \ntotal county road network, and there is an urgent need to upgrade rural roads and improve the \nmaintenance. Main issues associated with rural road maintenance are: (i) poor road quality; \n(ii) insufficient  funding,  (iii)  inadequate  planning,  (iv) limited  implementation  capacity,  and \n(v) lack of market-oriented approach and framework.  \n \n2.  Rural Road Maintenance Policy Reform. In line with its \"people first\" development \nstrategy and the desire to create a socially harmonious society, the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) Government has taken several actions. In 2005, the PRC State Council launched the \nPolicy Reform for Rural Road Maintenance. In December 2006, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous \nRegional People\u2019s Government (GRG) issued a rural road maintenance reform, which is being \nintroduced in three trial cities in Guangxi (Box A12). Experience from the trial cities will be \nreplicated in other areas.  \n \n \nBox A12: Guangxi Rural Road Maintenance Policy Reform \n \n \n \n\u2022  Demarcate responsibilities with county governments. \n    County governments are the main administrators for rural road maintenance. \n    Local governments should manage the fund, and ensure proper maintenance of rural roads. \n  \u2022  Stipulate a specific ratio of the road maintenance fee collected for road maintenance. \nEighty percent of the road maintenance fee collected from motorized vehicles by local governments after \n \ndeductions (such as collection costs, traffic police, and water conservancy construction fund) should be used \n \nfor road maintenance. \n    By 2010, 100% of the road maintenance fee collected from motorized vehicles by local governments after \n  deductions should be used for road maintenance. \n  \u2022  Impose a minimum level of funding for major road maintenance. \n  The allocation will not be lower than CNY7,000 per kilometer (km) per annum for county roads, CNY3,500 per \n \nkm per annum for township roads, and CNY1,000 per km per annum for village roads. \n \n\u2022  Impose minimum funding for routine road maintenance. \n    The allocation will not be lower than CNY5,000 per km per annum for county roads, CNY2,500 per km per \n  annum for township roads, and CNY1,000 per km per annum for village roads. \n  \u2022  Introduce a market-oriented mechanism. \n \n \n  Source: Guangxi Communication Department. \n \n \n3.  Improve Rural Road Maintenance in Baise. To ensure the sustainability of the project, \nGCD agreed to implement the rural road maintenance policy reform in Baise. GCD will ensure a \nreasonable share (at least 80%) of the total revenue of the road maintenance fee is allocated for \nroad maintenance and rehabilitation. GCD will be in charge of (i) operationalizing rural road \nmaintenance  funding  policy  reform;  (ii) developing  the  rural  road  information  system  and \neffectively using it for maintenance, planning, and operations; (iii) adjusting its organization \nstructures  and  training  programs  to  devote  more  resources  to  rural  maintenance,  and \n(iv) increasing competitive and market-based procurement of maintenance services through \ncontractual schemes drawing on the capacity of private sector contractor.  \n \n4.  Road Inventory and Condition Databank. GCD conducted a regional road inventory \nand condition survey in 2006 using relevant data collection requirements developed by the \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \nMinistry of Communications. The survey identified about 20,000 rural unclassified roads in \nGuangxi. All of the data and information will be inputted in the road condition databank being \ndeveloped by GCD. At present, fund allocation for prioritizing maintenance work is still being \ndone manually, with emphasis given to national and provincial highways and other emergency \nneeds. GCD will design a maintenance cost and fund allocation model and integrate it with the \nroad condition databank. Rural road management and administration will be strengthened and \nregularly assessed by this model. \n \n5.  Rural  Road  Maintenance  Study.  ADB  held  an  in-depth  dialogue  during  project \npreparation that led to a good understanding of rural road maintenance issues and of how to \naddress them. The Project will support GCD initiatives to implement policy reform by identifying \nand test market-based mechanism and technologies that offer possibilities for improving the \nquality and efficiency of road maintenance. To achieve this objective, a rural road maintenance \nstudy will be conducted under the Project to develop an effective maintenance mechanism and \nregulations. Guangxi Highway Administration Bureau (GHAB) will be responsible for the study, \nwhich will be supported by $100,000 of the ADB loan. The study will review road maintenance \nissues in Guangxi and focus on the following areas (paras. 6\u20139). \n \n6.  Effective Maintenance Mechanism. Surveys will be carried out to review current road \nmaintenance practice and identify needs for improvement based on international and domestic \nexperience. The review will focus on funding and its source, institutional arrangement, new \ntechnologies in maintenance, maintenance standards, road condition survey and assessment, \nshort- and medium-term maintenance program, budgeting, and market-based procurement and \nactivities. Based on the output of the review, experiences relating to market-based effective \nmechanisms and new technologies will be analyzed and tested under the study. The study will \nprepare an action plan for wide-scale implementation of good practices and modalities. \n \n7.  Rural Road Maintenance Handbook. To provide practical guidance for crew leaders \nand workers, a rural road maintenance handbook will be developed. It will make use of current \navailable handbooks (both international and domestic practice) and maintenance codes; and \nincorporate more information on labor, application of necessary equipment, appropriate data \ncollection, treatment for various defects, and development of human resource management and \nsafety at work. The handbook will cover the maintenance activities for paved and unpaved \nroads, road facilities and drainage, and environment and work zone safety issues. \n \n8.  Road Inventory and Condition Databank. The study will review the road inventory and \ncondition databank prepared by GCD to identify the current status and application situation. The \nreview  may  include  (i)  inventory  data;  (ii)  condition  data;  (iii)  data  collection  and  update; \n(iv) funding,  institution,  equipment,  and  staff  to  maintain  the  databank;  (v) function  and \napplication of the databank; and (vi) the function and attributes of the digital road network. The \nstudy will recommend improvements and actions plans to utilize the databank more effectively. \n \n9.  Relevant  Training.  At  least  300  persons-months  of  training  and  dissemination  of \ninformation will be included in the study, which may include the use of the handbook, concept of \nlife-cycle cost, and the benefit of market-oriented implementation mechanism. The attendees of \ntraining session will be relevant subnetwork managers, county and township authorities, crew \nleaders, local communities, and contractors. \n \n \n ", "Item    DETAILED COCoSsTt E($S mTIiMllioAnT)ES ABD%YB  FoIfN CAoNstC IER CComhimnau nBiacna%kti  ooonff  sC ost  Gover%nm oefn Ct ost                        \n$a Categoryb $ Category $ Category\nA.

The  project  expressway  forms  a  key  section  of  the  east-west  Kunming  (Yunnan)\u2013\nShantou (Guangdong) corridor of the National Expressway Network Plan. This corridor starts \nfrom Shantou in Guangdong province goes through Liuzhou, Hechi, Baise, and Longlin in \nGuangxi province, then passes through Xingyi in Guizhou province before heading west to \nKunming. It will help reduce imbalanced development between western and eastern regions. \nThe Project is also one of the sections of the proposed Guangxi regional expressway network. \nConnected with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed Guangxi Roads Development II \nProject (Nanning\u2013Baise expressway), it will provide the shortest route to seaports and the \nborder between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam for inland southwest \nprovinces in the PRC such as Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan. \n \n2.  In Guizhou, the expressway will connect the planned expressway from Banba (Guangxi \nborder) to Jiangdi (126 kilometers [km]; the prefeasibility study was already approved and \nconstruction will start in 2007; completion is targeted for 2012). In Yunnan, it will connect from \nJiangdi to Kunming, total 260 km (Kunming\u2013Yiliang\u2013Shilin opened to traffic in 2003, and Shilin\u2013\nZhaokua\u2013Jiangdi  opened  to  traffic  in  2006).  The  ADB-financed  Nanning  (Tanluo)\u2013Baise \nexpressway will be opened to traffic in 30 June 2008; the Nanning to Youyiguan and Youyiguan \nto Hanoi sections are functioning well. By 2012, the Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi section of the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Corridor will be completed. \n \n3.  The project expressway will be built parallel to the existing national highway (NH) 324, a \nmajor class-III road. The pavement condition of most of road is poor due to the many heavy \nloaded trucks that travel its length. Much of the highway is in mountainous country and has tight \ncurves and steep grades resulting in low speeds and high safety risks. The estimated motorized \ntraffic in 2006 is about 3,854\u20138,369 passenger car units (pcu) per day by section. The current \ntraffic  may  reach  the  road\u2019s  designed  capacity  before  2012,  the  proposed  opening  year, \nthroughout most of its length. Compared with the existing NH324, the project expressway will be \napproximately 34 km shorter and offer a time savings of at least 3 hours. \n \n4.  Estimated  traffic  on  the  project  road  is  based  on  routine  traffic  counts  and  the \ncomprehensive origin and destination surveys carried out in May 2004 (calibrated and updated \nduring October 2006 by project preparatory technical assistance consultants) at seven selected \nobservation stations on the NH324 and other roads under the feasibility study. A traffic demand \nmodel was made on the basis of a conventional growth model. Traffic demand was projected \nseparately for passenger and freight vehicles for 2012, 2022, and 2032 from the base year of \norigin and destination matrix and demand elasticities of 1.0 and 0.9. The average traffic growth \nrates in the project corridor are estimated to be 9% per year during 2006\u20132012, 6% per year \nduring 2012\u20132022, and 5% per year during 2022\u20132032. \n \n5.  The traffic forecasts allow for potential generated and diverted traffic as a result of \n(i)  additional traffic generated by the Project because of the lower cost of expressway travel; \n(ii) traffic diverted to the rail network because of rail capacity enhancement and some low value \nbulk freight transport (e.g., coal) with the same origin and destination as the highway; and \n(iii) potential diverted traffic from other road networks as a result of the increased capacity \nprovided by the expressway. Generated traffic was estimated using price elasticities of minus \n0.3 for passenger traffic and minus 0.2 for freight traffic, and is anticipated to be 11.2% of \nnormal passenger traffic and 9.1% of normal freight traffic. The traffic projection also takes \naccount of nonmodeled local intrazone traffic on the road network. \n \n ", "  Appendix 17  55 \n6.  Traffic was assigned between every pair of traffic zones. Vehicles moving from one zone \nto another make a choice of link paths based on their perceptions of generalized travel costs, a \nfunction of travel time, distance, and associated toll cost, affected by road conditions and traffic \ncongestion. The diverted traffic from existing roads was calculated using ADB\u2019s toll diversion \nmodel. The results of the analysis indicate that an average of 53% of vehicles may be diverted \nto the expressway in 2012. The traffic diversion rate is expected to increase to 88% by 2022 \nand stabilize thereafter. \n \n7.  Ramp-up has been a factor on several expressways opened recently. Ramp-up is the \npropensity for some traffic not to immediately transfer from the existing road to the expressway. \nIt often takes a few years for the full potential of expressway traffic to be realized. To estimate \nthis effect, the assumptions, based on the data for the Liuzhou\u2013Yizhou expressway, were made \nas follow: 60%, 75%, and 90% of the expected flow for 2012, 2013, and 2014. \n \n8.  The resulting traffic projection, by sections, is summarized in Table A17. The forecast \ntraffic volume on the expressway is expected to grow from an average of 6,330 pcu in 2012 to \nan average of 18,800 pcu in 2022, an 11.5% average annual growth rate. It will then grow \nslowly at 5% per annum thereafter to reach an average of 30,500 pcu in 2032. \n \nTable A17: Average Annual Daily Traffic on Project Expressway by Sections \n(passenger car unit) \n \nYear  Border Weile\u2013 Jiuzhou\u2013 Luchen\u2013 Tianlin\u2013 Xiatang Yongle Baise\u2013 Weighted \n\u2013Weile  Jiuzhou  Luchen  Tianlin  Xiatang  \u2013Yongle  \u2013Baise  Sitang  Average \n                   \nA.

General. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project, as the indicator of \neconomic analysis, was estimated by comparing the situation with and without the Project. \nWithout the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing road network, national highway (NH) \n324, which will be more congested and expensive to maintain due to rapidly increasing traffic \nvolume, causing delays and resulting in increased travel time, vehicle operating cost (VOC and \nroad accidents. With the Project, traffic will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer travel due to \nrapid reduction of congestion along the corridor. Some additional trips will be generated as the \neconomy responds to lower transport costs and better services. Some traffic will be diverted \nfrom other road networks in the corridor. \n \n2.  Assumptions.  The  economic  analysis  incorporates  5  years  of  implementation  and \n20 years of operation. Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2007 prices, expressed in \nCNY using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.013 for \nforeign  exchange  effects.  Unskilled  labor  is  valued  using  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of \n0.7 considering the low productivity and unemployment in the area. The economic costs of the \nexpressway include (i) the capital costs, including physical contingency, land acquisition and \nresettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs;  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) for the expressway, including the costs of replacing depreciated equipment \nand periodic maintenance. The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOC resulting from \nreduced travel distance and improved road conditions; (ii) savings in the value of passenger \ntime tied up in transit; (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents; (iv) benefits to generated \ntraffic; and (v) savings in capital and O&M costs for NH324. \n \n3.  Expressway  Component.  The  project  expressway  will  shorten  the  route  by \n34 kilometers (km). The calculations of VOC savings allow for differences in roughness, terrain, \nspeed, and congestion; and also for a changing vehicle mix for both passenger and freight \nvehicles, and improvements in vehicle performance. The typical economic VOCs are shown in \nTable A18.1. Travel time savings are valued for passengers in vehicles only, as the time of crew \nmembers  is  valued  in  the  VOC.  They  are  valued  at  25%\u201375%  of  the  average  wage  of \npassengers on the project expressway. The values used per person-hour are CNY5.47 for car \npassengers and CNY1.04 for bus passengers. The economic costs of accidents are estimated \nin terms of direct property damage and forgone income on the basis of national data for 2005. \nThe  average  economic  cost  of  an  accident  is  estimated  at  CNY108,800  on  expressways, \nCNY93,000 on class-II roads, and CNY70,000 on class-III roads. The benefits of generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the VOC and time savings of normal traffic as a proxy for willingness \nto pay. In addition, savings in capital and O&M costs for NH324 are calculated on the basis of \nmaintaining a volume-to-capacity ratio of 1.0 without the Project. The EIRR for the expressway \ncomponent is estimated at 17.1%, indicating that the Project is economically viable, with a net \npresent value of CNY4,206 million. \n \n4.  Rural Road Component. The rural roads for upgrading under the Project were chosen \nbased on the effect on overall road network efficiency and benefit-cost analysis, economic \ndevelopment potential, and population density. The rural road costs include capital costs and \nO&M costs. The principal benefits of the local road improvement are identified as (i) VOC \nsavings (Table A18.1), (ii) benefits to generated traffic, and (iii) savings in O&M costs. The rural \nroads have a combined EIRR of 21.7% per annum with net present value of CNY504.3 million. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 18  57 \nTable A18.1: Estimated Economic Vehicle Operating Cost, 2012 \n(CNY per km, 2006 prices) \nVehicle  Expressway  Existing Road \nCar  1.26  1.45 \nMedium-Sized Bus  2.01  2.34 \nSmall Truck  1.29  1.63 \nMedium-Sized Truck  1.83  2.40 \nHeavy Truck  2.06  2.49 \nArticulated Truck  2.74  3.39 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Guangxi Communications Department staff. \n \n5.  Rural Transport Service Component. The combination of rural bus stations and route \nlicensing changes will benefit passengers through (i) time savings resulting from more frequent \nand  reliable  services  and  quicker  bus  turnaround  at  terminals,  (ii)  lower  fares  reflecting \noperators\u2019 cost savings, (iii) reduced safety risk, (iv) improved amenities at terminals, and \n(v) increased travel in response to lower transport costs and travel times. Bus operators will \nbenefit by lower unit VOC with higher productivity and fleet savings resulting from the same \ndemand being met by fewer buses. For a typical station and associated routes, bus turnaround \ntimes and average passenger waiting times at terminals are estimated to fall by 70%, the \nnumber of buses to decrease by a third, bus utilization (km/day) to increase by 75%, average \nheadways and passenger waiting times at the roadside to fall 14%, time per passenger round \ntrip to decrease by 30%, and unit bus operating costs to decrease by 18%. For the typical rural \nterminal costing CNY0.5 million, the EIRR is as high as 29.2%. Passenger time savings account \nfor 37% of discounted benefits, operators\u2019 savings due to a smaller fleet 20%, and direct \nsavings in VOC 44 %; benefits to generated traffic are negligible. \n \n6.  The Whole Project. The Project as a whole generates an estimated EIRR of 17.5% \n(Table A18.2). The EIRR is 17.1% for the expressway, 21.7% for the rural roads, and 29.2% for \nbus stations. The VOC savings from the expressway are the major economic benefit (75%) \nfollowed by passenger time savings (8%). Avoided accident costs, savings to generated traffic, \nand other benefits are all relatively small. The benefits of the rural roads and bus stations, while \nimportant to the communities concerned, account for 10.3% of the total benefits. The results of \nsensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability (Table A18.3). The \ncapital cost would have to be 76% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall to the cutoff rate of \n12%. Considering the experience of ADB in the People\u2019s Republic of China, such an increase in \ncapital cost is unlikely. A distribution analysis was conducted to determine the project effects for \nvarious beneficiaries, including road users, labor, and government. Road users will receive the \nlargest share of net benefit, accounting for 92% (41% for passenger traffic and 51% for freight \ntraffic) of the total net benefits.  \n \nTable A18.3: Sensitivity Analysis \nItem  EIRR (%)  NPV (million)  Switching Valuea (%) \n1.

The financial analysis was undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). To ensure financial sustainability, the \nfinancial analysis measured the project\u2019s ability to generate sufficient revenue from operations \nto meet all costs, including operation and maintenance (O&M), depreciation, financial costs, and \na reasonable rate of return on investment. \n \nA.  Financial Projections \n \n2.  Base year tolls in 2007 prices are shown in Table A19.1. The toll charges are assumed \nto increase once every 5 years to keep up with inflation. Under the current Guangxi \u201cgreen \npassage\u201d regulations, to reduce the burden for the poor, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural \nproduce or livestock are exempted from tolls. Local communities benefit from the exemption. \nTen percent of such vehicles are assumed to be exempted from tolls. Other income (from fuel \nsales, rental income) amounts to 3% of toll revenue. \n \nTable A19.1: Base Year Tolls at 2007 Prices (CNY per vehicle-km) \nVehicle Class  A  B  C  D1  D2  E \nPassenger vehicles  \u22647 seats  8\u201319 seats  20\u201339 seats  \u2014  \u2265 40 seats  \u2014 \nGoods vehicles  \u22642 tons  2\u20135 tons  5\u201310 tons  10\u201315 tons, TEU  \u2014  >15 ton, 2 TEU \nToll rate in CNY  0.40  0.8  1.2  1.44  1.6  1.68 \nTEU = twenty-foot equivalent unit containers, 2 TEU = 40-foot containers. \nSources: Guangxi Communication Department and Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n3.  Annual incremental O&M costs are calculated based on the following estimates: (i) toll \noperation  cost  totaling  CNY8.53  million  in  2012  (320 employees  and  other  administration \nexpenses); (ii) routine maintenance costs at CNY200,000/kilometer (km) per annum in 2007 \nprices to increase in line with traffic flows using an elasticity of 0.1; (iii) tunnel O&M costs at \nCNY5.3 million in 2012 using 2007 prices; and (iv) periodic maintenance cost required in 2022 \nat a cost of CNY1.5 million/km in 2007 prices. All incremental O&M costs are projected to \nincrease annually in line with domestic inflation rates. \n \n4.  The project funding is based on 46% equity or grants, 54% long-term loans. The China \nBank of Communications loan will be repayable over 25 years, including a 5-year grace period. \nThe terms of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan are assumed as 25-year maturity, \nincluding  a  5-year  grace  period,  US  dollar  London  interbank  offered  rate,  with  a  0.35% \ncommitment  fee.  Applicable  business  taxes  at  a  rate  of  5.6%  are  charged  on  revenue. \nCorporate income tax at 33% is paid on income after deducting business taxes, depreciation \nand interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward. Despite \nthe low profitability, the forecast revenue under the base assumptions is sufficient to cover \nannual recurrent costs, depreciation, and debt repayments from the expressway operation from \nthe sixth year of full operation. Projected financial statements are in Table A19.2. \n \n5.  Based on this projection, the project expressway could achieve (i) a debt-equity ratio of \nnot more than 65:35; (ii) a working ratio (annual O&M cost, but excluding periodic maintenance \ncost, to revenue) of not more than 15%; and (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than \n1.2 from the sixth year of its full operation. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n6.  The major assumptions used for calculating the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare (i) all calculations are made in 2007 prices, covering 2007 to 2031; (ii) capital costs include \nall  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the  construction  and  equipment  for  the \nexpressway, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) O&M costs \n ", "60  Appendix 19 \ninclude all annual incremental expenses incurred in operating the expressway, but exclude \ndepreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from tolls used in financial \nprojections are adjusted to 2007 prices; and (v) the residual value equal to undepreciated value \nof capital investment is included as a benefit of the FIRR calculation. \n \n7.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital, after-tax, in real terms was calculated \nusing an estimated capital mix and cost of funds. Costs are considered as follows: (i) the \napplicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is used for ADB \ndebt, (ii) the estimated interest costs of 6.16% per annum are used for domestic loan funds, and \n(iii) cost of equity is assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to reflect the impact of \nincome tax of 33%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost of debt by applying \ndomestic  and  international  average  inflation  rates  for  domestic  and  foreign  currency \ndenominated  debt,  respectively.  The  FIRR  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  is  4.5%.  This \ncompares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also computed at an after-tax \nbasis, of 3.3% (Table A19.3). The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \nThe sensitivity of the project's financial indicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in \nTable A19.4. \n \nC.  Impact of Toll Rate \n \n8.  The toll rate needs to satisfy two criteria: (i) generates enough revenue to obtain a \nhigher financial return on investment, and (ii) does not deter potential users and compromise \neconomic objectives. These criteria can be contradictory. The analysis for this Project shows \nthat the overall average revenue from tolls will be about CNY0.70 per passenger car unit \n(pcu)/km in 2012, which should generate sufficient funds to service the loan while at the same \ntime involving little sacrifice of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The sensitivity test for \nthe  toll  rate,  taking  into  account  traffic  elasticity  to  tolls,  shows  that  even  at  a  toll  of \nCNY0.88/pcu/km the FIRR would reach 4.7% but the EIRR would remain in an acceptable \nrange (16%). Beyond the toll rate of CNY0.88/pcu/km, the EIRR would fall rapidly while the \nFIRR levels off.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?     No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nDespite rapid economic growth, the PRC\u2019s GDP per capita was still modest (CNY14,040) in 2005, with the absolutely \npoor population of 26.1 million and a low income population of 49.8 million. Using the international poverty line of \n$1/day consumption poverty line, the country still has about 135 million poor. The PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Program \nplaces a strong emphasis on rural development with a pledge to increase farmers\u2019 incomes and enhance public \nservices in the countryside. \n \nThe country program and strategy update for the PRC (2007\u20132008) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) seeks to \npromote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty through transport sector in ADB operations in the PRC. This \nProject directly contributes to these objectives by improving road transport efficiency and improving the access of rural \nvillages to income-generating opportunities and social services. More poor villages will have improved connectivity as a \nresult of expressway, rural road, and transport service improvements, which will help create the conditions necessary \nfor developing local resources and generating employment to raise living standards. \n \nThe ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program update for the Greater Mekong Subregion (2007\u20132009) support \nharmonizing cross-border trade and improving transport infrastructure. The Project will directly contribute through road \nimprovements and bus stations near the border with Viet Nam. This will promote regional cooperation by improving \ncross-border trade, transport services, and livelihoods of the poor living in the border area.  \n \nThe Project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, which focuses on aligning ADB operations with a \ncountry\u2019s own poverty reduction strategy and fostering of partnerships. Accordingly, the project\u2019s social and poverty \ninterventions were prepared in the context of Guangxi\u2019s poverty reduction and development plans. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe project area covers one district and seven counties. It has a population of 2.3 million with a poverty rate of 30% \nand 7% of residents live in absolute poverty. Ethnic minorities comprise 80% of the population; 36% are poor. The road \nimprovements will lead to lower transport costs, improved transport services, improved access to markets and social \nservices, increased competitiveness, expansion of economic opportunities, diversification of rural livelihoods, and \npoverty reduction. Farmers will benefit from reduced transport costs, better access to markets, increased opportunities \nfor diversification, and increased competition for their products leading to increased incomes. This will promote \ndiversification and significantly enhance the impact of local development programs on farmer\u2019s incomes and community \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  increase  economic  development  in  the  area  and  the  growth  of  off-farm  income \nopportunities including jobs during implementation. The rural transport services improvements will help establish better \ntransport services providing improved efficiency and affordability, thereby increasing services to poor villages. The \nimproved rural transport network will provide better access to jobs, markets, health care, schools, and other services; \nand will increase the range of goods and services available in the community. The Project will also facilitate cross-\nborder trade, much of which is undertaken by small-scale traders, many of who are women. The improved roads and \nmore open border between the PRC and Viet Nam will also help to boost tourism development. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes        No \nProject surveys and community participatory consultations were carried out in preparing the poverty and social strategy \nwith priority given to rural areas, especially poverty-stricken villages and ethnic minority villages. This provided an \nunderstanding of the concerns and constraints facing farmers and gave villagers the opportunity to express transport-\nrelated concerns and opinions of both positive and negative impacts arising from the Project. In total, 979 households in \nthe project area were surveyed. According to local residents, the greatest benefits will be increased economic \ndevelopment in the area resulting in increased income sources and more job opportunities. Farmers had a keen \nunderstanding of the direct link between transport costs and farm profit margins and expected lower freight costs and \nimproved access to benefit them directly.  People also placed a good degree of  emphasis on a cleaner environment  \n ", "  Appendix 20  65 \nwith less dust and easier and faster transport. Residents also stated improved roads would provide better access for \nchildren traveling to schools and improve road safety.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe  resettlement  plans  and  the  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  include  plans  for  consultation  and \nparticipation during implementation. For example, before the alignment was finalized, local government officials and \nvillagers will be consulted to minimize losses of high-quality arable land and structures. Township governments and \ncommunity organizations will be directly involved in the implementation of the resettlement plans and EMDP. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nRural women participate actively in agricultural production in the project area; this, together with child care, care of the \nelderly, animal care, and household chores, results in heavy workloads for women. Local programs to improve rural \nhousehold living conditions, such as biogas systems and sanitation and drinking water facilities, have brought benefits \nto women, particularly to poor women in mountain communities. Nevertheless, female illiteracy is considerably higher \nthan male illiteracy and women\u2019s health situation, especially in mountain communities, is poor. \n \nThe Project will benefit women significantly and not have an adverse impact on women or children. They will benefit \nfrom easier transport, time savings, and improved access to medical facilities and other social facilities; and from a \ngeneral improvement in the quality of life. Women will benefit from greater access to information, jobs, and increased \nopportunities for selling and buying goods at markets. The participation strategy will give priority to women for benefits \nand protection against social risk; special gender measures are included in the EMDP and resettlement plans. Gender \ndisaggregated indicators will be monitored by the project performance management system. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nE.

One  resettlement  plan  covers  the  177  kilometers  (km)  expressway  and  related \nconnector roads, interchanges, toll stations, and service areas; while the other four resettlement \nplans  cover  the  local  roads  (310  km).  A  resettlement  policy  framework  and  procedural \nguidelines address the 750 km of village roads and 50 township bus stations. The location of \ntowns where bus stations will be built is known, but sites have not yet been decided. The village \nroads will be selected during implementation. Prior to commencement of land acquisition and \nhouse demolition, Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) will update all resettlement \nplans based on a detailed measurement survey and submit them to the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for approval.  \n \n2.  The  proposed  expressway  and  its  connector  roads  will  affect  10  townships  and \n35 administrative villages in Longlin and Tianlin counties, and Youjiang district of Baise. The \npreliminary design estimates that 1,475 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, of which about \n38% is farmland (comprising 12.6% paddy fields, 13.3% dry land, and 12.1% orchards), 42.5% \nforestland, 13% wasteland, and 6.5% other. Based on the standard of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) for impact assessment, the equivalent of 3,990 residents would lose all their land \nand agricultural livelihoods. Since the expressway will actually cross many parcels of scattered \nfarmland, the average loss of land per household is estimated at 20%, which means 19,950  will \nbe partially affected. Another 245 ha of land is estimated to be occupied temporarily during \nconstruction. Also, 140,400 square meters (m2) of houses will be demolished, necessitating \nrelocation of 1,390 rural households involving 4,000 people. The six local roads will require \n283 ha of land, which partially affects 10,200 people; 178 households will be relocated. \n \n3.  The resettlement objective is to ensure equal or better income and living standards, so it \nwill be implemented in accordance with the PRC Land Administration Law (2004), State Council \nDocument No. 28, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). GCD agreed that (i) for \nthe expressway, Guangxi Communications Infrastructure Administration Bureau will apply the \nnational standard for land compensation, which requires a minimum of 16 times annual average \noutput value; (ii) for the three local roads, Guangxi Highway Administration Bureau will apply the \nland  compensation  standards  based  on  Document  No.  39  issued  by  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous Regional People\u2019s Government; and (iii) for the village roads, the ownership of the \nroads and lands will be retained by the relevant village collective. The land compensation \nstandards used for all components are sufficient to meet replacement cost. The relevant village \ncommittees will ensure that those affected will be compensated through the provision of reserve \nland,  land  readjustment,  cash  payment,  or  payment-in-kind.  For  demolished  structures, \nreplacement value will be based on compensation rates in Baise. Those losing housing will be \nable to acquire new housing sites within their existing group or village, and close to a road. All \nsites  will  be  provided  with  water  supply,  electricity,  telephone  and  television  cable,  where \navailable.  The  relocated  families  will  receive  moving  allowances  and  temporary  housing \nallowances. \n \n4.  Detailed  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  plans  for  seriously  affected  villages  will  be \ndeveloped and included in the updated resettlement plan for the expressway component. Based \non consultations, most people affected prefer to get cash compensation directly to be used to \nexpand businesses, improve animal husbandry, plant cash crops and trees, and provide income \nsecurity until they find outside work. New employment and income generation opportunities will \narise during construction and after the expressway is completed. Expressway contractors will \ngive priority to affected households in the allocation of unskilled jobs during construction. \n ", "  Appendix 22  69 \n5.  Resettlement will be implemented by local governments with supervision by GCD to \nensure compliance with the approved resettlement plans. For the expressway component, the \nResettlement Division within the Longlin\u2013Baise Expressway Construction headquarters will be \ndirectly  responsible  for  coordinating  the  planning,  supervision,  financing,  and  reporting  of \nresettlement for the expressway and connector roads. A resettlement leading group and office \nwas established in Baise on 20 October 2006. Offices will also be set up in all the relevant \ncounties, and staff assigned in all affected townships and villages to implement resettlement. \nFor economically vulnerable people, including elderly living alone, disabled, households headed \nby women, and poverty households, the Project will provide additional training and physical \nsupport. For these measures, GCD has agreed to a budget of 1% of basic resettlement fees. \n \n6.  The 2004 Land Law requires disclosure and consultation with people affected. Affected \nvillages were notified about the key elements of the resettlement plans during meetings and \ninterviews. Information was disclosed through newspapers to all those affected in March 2007. \nDuring detailed resettlement planning, further notifications and consultations will discuss specific \nimpacts and how they will be addressed. In case of grievance, all complaints will be processed \nbased on the resettlement plans on Grievance and Redress. \n \n7.  The requirements for internal and external monitoring and evaluation are included in the \nresettlement plans. GCD will engage a qualified domestic monitor to carry out independent \nmonitoring and evaluation. The monitor will conduct a baseline survey prior to resettlement, \nsemiannual investigations during resettlement, and annual survey updates for 2 years after \ncompletion of resettlement; and will provide ADB and GCD with copies of the reports. For the \nexpressway component, an internal monitoring and reporting system will be established in the \nResettlement Division of the Longlin\u2013Baise Expressway Construction headquarters and report \nto ADB on the progress of land acquisition and resettlement through quarterly progress reports \nand a resettlement completion report. A summary of the resettlement audit will be provided to \nADB prior to the project completion review mission. For the other project components, internal \nmonitoring will be done by GCD and the land and resources bureaus; progress will be reported \nto ADB every 6 months. \n \n8.  The resettlement budget for the expressway is estimated at CNY600 million, for 6 local \nroads  at  CNY90  million;  and  for  other  components  at  CNY10  million.  Costs  include \ncompensation for land, housing, other assets, moving allowances, assistance for vulnerable \ngroups,  infrastructure,  administration,  taxes,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  contingencies. \nGCD will supplement the resettlement budget, as necessary, to meet any shortfall that emerges. \n \n9.  The  land  acquisition  and  housing  demolition  for  the  expressway  component  will \ncommence by September 2007. For the local roads and bus stations, some implementation will \ncommence in 2007; village road construction will commence in 2008. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20070821132519+08'00'", "Author": "LPC", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: prc 39149, guangxi roads development project,road transport network, road transport services improvement,economic capacity building,transport communications", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20070822092625+08'00'", "Title": "Western Guangxi Longlin-Baise Expressway"}, "author_page": " \n \n \n \n \n  Vice President  C.
