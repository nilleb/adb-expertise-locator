I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Raising Incomes of Small and Medium Farmers Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will reduce the market and business risks for small and medium farmers2 \nwho  diversify  into  high-value  commodities  (HVCs)  in  10  districts  of  Nepal\u2019s  Mid-Western \nDevelopment Region and Far-Western Development Region.3 The two regions have the lowest \nhuman development indexes within Nepal because of minimal investment in access to services, \nphysical, social, and economic infrastructure. Poverty incidence on average is high for both \nregions; within the regions, the hill areas suffer particularly high rates of poverty\u2014up to 70% of \nhouseholds fall below the poverty line. Small-farmer incomes are limited by (i) low returns from \ntraditional agricultural commodities, (ii) small and declining farm sizes with low productivity, and \n(iii) a supply-driven production system that has not captured the potential market benefits for \nHVCs.4  \n \n3.  The project will help small and medium-sized farmers diversify into HVCs by establishing \nmarket links; and providing capital for inputs and better technology, and for building postharvest \nvalue chain infrastructure such as storage, packaging, grading, and processing.5 Project grants \nwill  be  provided  to  (i)  small  and  medium  farmers  who  are  members  of  farmer  groups  or \ncooperatives with established market supply agreements for initial inputs and farm technology, \nand (ii) postharvest enterprises for the development of value chain infrastructure to support the \nmarket  supply  agreements.  The  project  will  outsource  service  delivery  to  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and the private sector for farmer mobilization, training, production, and \nbusiness planning, and for feasibility studies on access to project funding.  \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  Nepal\u2019s national development priorities are poverty reduction and food security through \neconomic growth. The importance of the agriculture sector is demonstrated by the fact that \n(i) about 80% of the population lives in rural areas and (ii) around 70% of that rural population is \nengaged in agriculture. Although agriculture\u2019s contribution to the gross domestic product has \nfallen from 72% in 1975 to 33% in 2008, most rural people continue to rely on agriculture, \nlivestock, and forestry for their livelihoods. Higher economic growth in urban areas has reduced \nurban poverty incidence to 10%, compared with 35% for the rural population. Within the project \nregions\u2019 districts, poverty incidence exceeds 40%, and surveys of small farmers show that more \nthan 65% of households are below the poverty line. As a consequence, men migrate for work, \nand  agriculture  and  the  rural  communities  are  increasingly  feminized.  There  is  minimal \ninvestment by the private sector because of low returns, high business risks arising from conflict \nand political uncertainty, high logistic costs and cost of doing business. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the list of linked documents is in Appendix 2. \n2  Defined as farmers with less than 1 hectare (ha) of land in the hills or less than 3 ha in the Terai. \n3  The project districts in the Mid-Western Development Region are: Banke, Bardiya, Dang, Dhailekh, and Surkhe. \nThe project districts in the Far-Western Development Region are: Baitadi, Dadeldhura, Darchula, Doti, and Kailali. \n4  HVCs are agricultural crops and other non-livestock-based commodities, such as honey, that generate a higher \nrate of return to the farmer per hectare than the production of staple crops such as cereals. \n5  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing the Crop Diversification and Commercialization Project. \nManila. The title of the project changed during the implementation of the technical assistance. \n ", "2 \n5.  Agricultural productivity in Nepal is low by international standards and in comparison \nwith India. The low yields and the declining relative yields reflect underinvestment in inputs and \ninnovation. Where yield advantages exist\u2014for example, in HVCs such as vegetables, fruit, and \nspices\u2014production growth occurs. Agriculture incomes are constrained by reliance on low-\nvalue, low-yield crops such as rice and wheat that are grown to offset food security risks \n(82% of the planted crop area). Farmers underinvest and employ low levels of technology on \nsmall fragmented plots of land, resulting in limited marketable output. Weak supply chains, \nlimited access to credit, weak husbandry practices, poor infrastructure, underdeveloped market \nchains, and lack of services all contribute to low productivity, low incomes, and risk-averse \ndecision making. Increasing climate change impacts from drought and high-intensity rain events \nwill  add  risk  to  farm  systems.  Public  sector  agricultural  services  reach  only  15%  of  farm \nhouseholds. Microfinance institutions withdrew services during the recent period of conflict, \ncurbing household purchasing power and supply-chain development.   \n \n6.  While trade with India has been growing at an annual rate of 16%, growth in agricultural \ntrade is low owing to limited trade surplus and complex trade requirements, especially World \nTrade Organization regulations regarding border quarantine certification, traceability, and food \nstandard certification. Trade with India is dominated by imports of HVCs, and farm inputs such \nas fertilizers and agricultural chemicals. Regarding fruit, domestic production directly substitutes \nfor declining imports; whereas for vegetables and spices, both domestic production and imports \ncontinue to increase, reflecting growth in demand and off-season export opportunities. Annual \ndomestic urban demand is estimated at 105,000 tons for fruit; 92,000 tons for vegetables; and \n7,400 tons for spices. Annual export demand is estimated at 736,100 tons for fruit; 683,954 tons \nfor vegetables; and 119,000 tons for spices.6 While there is unsatisfied domestic demand, local \nproduction can create selling risks through oversupply and distressed sales, especially during \npeak production season.7   \n \n7.  Significant opportunities in agriculture include (i) greater demand for HVCs as urban \nincomes increase; (ii) added demand for HVCs from continued growth in the tourism sector; and \n(iii) production and processing of high-value off-season products. Key market opportunities \ninclude substituting for the import of HVCs such as fruit and vegetables, and exporting to India \nand regional markets products with comparative advantage. Nepal is currently unable to meet \nWorld Trade Organization border compliance requirements that will limit the export of Nepal\u2019s \nagricultural products.8 \n \n8.  Government policy aims to improve productivity in the agriculture sector as a driver for \neconomic growth. The objectives of the National Agricultural Policy (2004) are (i) an increase in \nproductivity,  (ii)  expansion  of  commercial  agricultural  production,  and  (iii)  promotion  of \nsustainable natural resource management. To achieve commercial agricultural objectives, the \npolicy  and  its  supporting  agricultural  perspective  plan  propose: (i)  development  of market-\nbased, large-production pockets to achieve economies of scale in production and marketing;                \n(ii)  promotion  of  market-based,  high-value  commercial  agricultural  production  along  major \nhighways and north\u2013south road corridors; (iii) provision of incentives for educated youths to \nengage in agribusinesses; (iv) promotion of export-based organic farming; (v) protection of \nindigenous knowledge and technologies in agriculture; and (vi) promotion of cooperative farming \nand marketing of agricultural products. \n                                                \n6  Netherlands  Development  Organisation.  2010.

Sector objectives require commercially competitive agricultural production. The country \npartnership  strategy9 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identifies  the  agriculture  and \nnatural resource sector as a priority sector. The project, while complimenting on-going initiatives \nin the rural sector, including those in irrigation, rural infrastructure, commercial agriculture and \nrural finance,10 will continue to facilitate diversification and commercialization of agriculture in \nregions with highest poverty levels in Nepal. And will contribute to enhanced  food security and \npoverty reduction by supporting the transition of the rural poor and socially excluded groups \nfrom a largely subsistence economy to a commercial one.    \n \n10.  The project design responds to key lessons accumulated in the sector, including greater \ncoordination  with  other  sectors,  partnership  with  nongovernment  organizations,  catalyzing \nprivate sector investments, establishing strategic market linkages and institutionalizing impact \nevaluation processes. The design is also aligned with initiatives by other development partners \nsupporting commercialization of agriculture. These include the World Bank-funded Agricultural \nCommercialization and Trade Project, and the International Fund for Agriculture Development-\nfunded High Value Agriculture in Hill and Mountain Areas Project. Technical expertise supported \nby the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) and other rural initiatives with synergy \npotential are included in project awareness and training activities.   \n \n11.  The project contributes to level 1 of ADB\u2019s results framework by boosting rural incomes, \nreducing poverty and increasing food security in Nepal (ADB targets 17.14% of the Asia\u2013Pacific \npopulation living on less than $1 per day by 2015); under the project, over 45,000 individuals will \nmove above this threshold. ADB\u2019s level 2 country outcome performance targets are addressed \nby  providing  project  grants  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  including  farmer \ncooperatives; the project will support an estimated 220 enterprises and 890 farmer groups \n(ADB\u2019s target is to support 54,000 enterprise accounts). The project contributes to the level 3 \noperational targets through development of the private sector in the poorer parts of rural Nepal \n(ADB\u2019s target is for private sector involvement in 30% of projects) and gender mainstreaming \n(ADB\u2019s target is for gender mainstreaming in 40% of projects). The implementation modality \nbuilds strong partnerships with NGOs (ADB\u2019s target is for NGO inclusion in 80% of projects).  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project impact will be greater profitability of small and medium-sized farmers in \n10 project districts. The outcome of the project will be increased production of HVCs by small \nand medium-sized farmers (footnote 1). By 2017, the 7,500 hectares (ha) of contracted HVC \nproduction will achieve an estimated annual output of 64,500 tons with a projected retail value of \n$31.0 million; farm-gate value of $13.5 million; and a gross margin to farmers of $9.5 million per \nannum. Since HVC production falls into the domain of women, the project will increase women\u2019s \ncash income. The project is expected to benefit an estimated 18,700 farm households that \nwould grow HVC crops on the average in 0.4 ha for existing farmers and 0.25 ha for the \ndisadvantaged persons.11  \n  \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2009.

The  project  outputs  will  comprise:  (i)  establishing  the  agribusiness  grant  facility  for \nbuilding HVC value chains in the project regions to supply markets; (ii) formulating business \nplans for producing, and adding value to, HVCs in the two regions; and (iii) ensuring effective \nand efficient project management.   \n14.  Output  1:  Establishing  the  agribusiness  grant  facility  for  building  high-value \ncommodity value chains to supply markets. To achieve output 1, the project will establish a \nfacility to provide grants to beneficiaries to invest in (i) postharvest facilities and support for \nfarmer cooperatives; (ii) essential inputs for HVC production; and (iii) selected essential farm \ntechnology, including for climate change adaptation, all of which will benefit disadvantaged \npersons including indigenous peoples, and households headed by women that are involved in \nthe production and marketing of HVCs. Grants will be given to successful applicants upon \nreview by an independent advisory panel12 and approval by the project director. The grant \neligibility  criteria  and  approval  process  are  described  in  the  project  administration  manual \n(PAM).13 The provision of grants to beneficiaries is justified by the observed market failure in the \nagribusiness investments and the cost of doing business in the project regions: (i) high logistical \ncosts, and (ii) political and business risks, including the costs of aggregating supply. \n \n15.  Output  2:  Business  plans  for  producing,  and  adding  value  to,  high-value \ncommodities. The project will (i) provide postharvest enterprises with HVCs and agribusiness \ntraining, supplier agreements,  and support for formulating  business plans; (ii) develop and \ndisseminate agriculture market information; (iii) use market supply agreements, build integrated \nmarket chains linking buyers to farmer cooperatives, and cooperatives to farmer groups, with \nsupporting  production  plans;  (iv)  open  up  access  to  on-farm  services,  technical  support \n(including climate change adaptation), and production planning services to build capacity of \nsmall and medium farmers; (v) support HVC producers by strengthening the capacity of district \nagriculture  development  offices,  community  agricultural  service  centers,  and  agricultural \nresource centers to respond to the needs, constraints, and opportunities of disadvantaged \npersons,  indigenous  peoples,  and  women;  and  (vi)  mobilize  existing  and  new  groups  of \ndisadvantaged farmers with predominantly female members. \n  \n16.  Output 3: Effective and efficient project management. Output 3 will be achieved \nthrough project management and administration, and by ensuring the efficient and effective \nimplementation of the project by the project management unit (PMU) in Nepalgunj and a liaison \noffice  in  Kathmandu.  The  project  will  provide  consulting  services  to  support  project \nmanagement,  technical  backstopping  for  HVC  value  chain  development  and  on-farm  HVC \nproduction.  Post-graduate  training,  HVC  awareness  programs,  agricultural  marketing  fairs, \nadherence to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and monitoring will be undertaken.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $33.54 million (Table 1). \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n12 The independent advisory panel will include regional agricultural directors; a representative of the Agro Enterprise \nCenter; technical specialists; and social and environmental safeguard staff from the project management unit. \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem     Amounta \nA.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $20.10 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2.  ADB \nwill  finance  60%  of  the  total  costs,  including  contingencies.  The  government  will  provide \n$5.33 million equivalent to 16% of the project cost, including PMU staff salaries and taxes.  \nBeneficiary contributions of $7.62 million include contributions to investments and increasing \npayments for services established under the project. SNV will finance the agribusiness and \nvalue-chain backstopping package with parallel grant financing for 50% of the direct costs of \nprofessional staff, with the ADB grant providing the remainder. The PMU will contract SNV \naccording to the terms of reference at a price that is equivalent to the agreed cost less the \ndiscount being offered by SNV. To determine the contract's value, the executing agency will \ndiscount the firm's representations regarding cost to the extent that the parallel grant financing \nis fully offset.  Provision of the services by SNV will not be conditional upon its parallel financing \nits part of the project.

Grants will be provided to enterprises and producers with market supply agreements that \nare signed between buyers and producer cooperatives or farmer groups based on business and \nproduction plan applications. Applications will be reviewed by the independent advisory panel \nthat will advise the PMU of eligibility. The PMU shall prepare guidelines for the submission of \ngrant applications, including monthly deadlines and timelines for panel meeting dates. Grant \neligibility criteria are provided in the PAM. Once an application is approved, the applicant will \nenter into a contract with NRB and DOA pursuant to which funds will be disbursed to the \napplicant. Applicants will procure according to commercial practices and provide procurement \ndocumentation to the PMU for review. Upon proof of eligibility, the PMU will instruct the NRB to \nadvance funds in installments to the beneficiary\u2019s bank account. Should the advisory panel \nfindings  be  disregarded,  the  project  director  must  obtain  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval  before  any \ncontract or disbursement is undertaken.

Output 2: Business Plans for Producing, and Adding Value to, High-Value \nCommodities in the Project Regions \n21.  Activities for output 2 will be implemented by AEC and service providers contracted for \nHVC supply. AEC will also implement the securing of markets. AEC\u2019s role provides (i) access to \nthe 700 members of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, which \ninclude domestic agribusiness enterprises, (ii) local presence in the two regions and 10 project \ndistricts,  which  will  be  strengthened and  sustained  beyond  the  project,  and (iii)  access to \nagribusiness capacity-building products that the AEC can supply to project beneficiaries. AEC \nwill implement market-linking programs, HVC market network promotion, and the development \nof knowledge products. AEC will support the PMU in procuring training services for postharvest \nenterprises, and other related tasks such as service provider prequalification procedure, and \nreviewing local service provider business plans and grant applications. AEC will expand its \nagricultural market information system to the project districts. Office facilities and equipment will \nbe procured through shopping while staff costs will be considered implementation costs.  \n \n22.  To secure supply from farmer groups with market agreements, the PMU will contract a \nnational service provider through the quality- and cost-based selection procedures for technical \nsupport, overall quality control, and supervision of local service providers. The national service \nprovider will develop training programs, apply quality control to local service providers, and \nensure training for and awareness of the project grant eligibility and application process. At the \ndistrict level, the PMU will contract local NGO services. These service providers will deliver \nsocial  mobilization,  HVC  awareness  and  training  programs,  and  planning  assistance  that \nenables farmer groups to access project grants for inputs to HVC production. The project, \nthrough  separate  NGO  contracts,  will  set  up  as  many  as  90  farmer  groups  among \ndisadvantaged persons. These contracts include provision for mobilization, access to project \ntraining and project grants, and the leasing of land for 1.5 years (three crop seasons) to groups \nof landless farmers. \n \nIII.

The project benefits will (i) boost incomes of small and medium farmers from HVC \nproduction and increase cropping intensity by 16%; (ii) provide additional employment\u2014on-farm \nhired labor will increase by about 6,180 jobs per year;16 postharvest employment is estimated to \nbe about 4,130 jobs per year, of which aout 1,830 are unskilled; and (iii) strengthen capacity of \nrural enterprises and farmer cooperatives through value addition within HVC value chains. \n                                                \n15 This requirement reflects sector experience with delays of such disbursements and also highlights the critical \nnature of timely availability of inputs for HVCs, which have short growing seasons defined by market opportunities \nand/or climatic conditions.  \n16 One full-time equivalent is assumed to be 200 paid days per year. \n ", "8 \nProject beneficiaries will be an estimated 18,700 producers of HVCs (Economic and Financial \nAnalysis, Appendix 2). \n24.  Farmers  diversifying  into  HVC  production  will  have  higher  incomes.  Small-farmer \nincomes per household are estimated to rise by NRs5,380 in the Terai (an increase of 17%) and \nby NRs8,780 in the hills (a 68% increase). Medium-sized farm incomes per household are \nestimated to increase by NRs22,130 in the Terai and by NRs34,690 in the hills\u2013to three times \ntheir current levels. A sample of potential value chain investments was assessed in financial and \neconomic  analysis,  and  all  are  deemed  financially  and  economically  viable.  The  financial \ninternal rates of return range from 12% to 30% compared with an estimated weighted average \ncost  of  capital  of  4.7%.17 The  economic  internal  rates  of return  range from  14%  to  30%, \naveraging 23% for the indicative postharvest investments. Inclusion of farmer output benefits, \nand project implementation and management costs results in a project economic internal rate of \nreturn of 21%.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n25.  MOAC has experience in implementing ADB and donor programs. Project measures to \nenhance governance and prevent corruption during implementation include (i) establishment of \ntransparent procedures for financial transactions; (ii) the use of private providers to undertake \ndue diligence during business planning and the review of this by the national service providers; \n(iii) the inspection of a sample of project grants for the first 2 years by staff from district \nagriculture development offices; (iv) the review of grant proposals by the independent advisory \npanel, with prior ADB approval for grants of more than $100,000; (v) stakeholders\u2019 annual \nprogress evaluations; and (vi) the PMU\u2019s reporting of all project activities and related financial \nstatements to the public on its website.18 \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOAC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.19 \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  The project supports the agriculture sector and ties in with Nepal\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy by contributing to poverty alleviation. The project is estimated to benefit 18,700 farm \nhouseholds in the project regions, which have the highest incidence of poverty in the country.20 \nThe headcount measure of poverty incidence is 45% in the Mid-Western Development Region \nand 41% in the Far-Western Development Region, compared with a national average of 31%. \nThe project promotes the inclusion of women and disadvantaged persons, such as marginalized \nand small indigenous farmers, to ensure benefits deliver inclusive growth. The majority of farm \nhouseholds (65%) in the project regions have food deficits, and an estimated 1 in 3 households \nis rated as food insecure.21  A poverty reduction and social strategy, a gender equity and social \ninclusion  (GESI)  plan,  and  an  indigenous  peoples  assessment  and  measures  have  been \n                                                \n17 Postharvest  indicative  investments  include  multi-commodity  on-farm  storage,  collection,  cool  storage,  and \ncommodity-specific processing. \n18 Nepal  Post-Conflict  Sensitive  Approach:  A  Peace  Building  Tool  (Peace  Filter)  for  Project  Design  and \nImplementation (Appendix 2). \n19 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n20 The data used in this paragraph is taken from Central Bureau of Statistics. 2004. Nepal Living Standards Survey \n(NLSS), 2003\u20132004. Kathmandu. \n21 ADB. 2010. Socio-economic and Gender Analysis Report, Consolidated and Management Services Nepal (P) Ltd. \n ", "9 \nprepared.22 The GESI  plan for the  project  has three themes: (i) mainstreaming  of gender \nempowerment in recognition of women\u2019s prevalence in agricultural work and of the potential for \nHVC production, processing, and marketing to further reduce the gender gaps; (ii) a program to \ninclude  disadvantaged  persons,  such  as  help  to  access  services,  capital,  and  land;  and \n(iii) capacity building of project stakeholders to understand the differing needs, constraints, and \nopportunities of indigenous peoples and disadvantaged persons, and the gender impacts. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n28.  An environmental and social management system (ESMS) for the project has been \nprepared, and the disaster and climate change risk screen applied.23 The project is classified as \ncategory FI. Screening procedures have been established under the ESMS to ensure that all \nsubprojects  financed  under  the  project  meet  ADB  requirements  specified  in  Safeguard \nRequirements 1-3. The eligibility for project grant funds excludes investments that fall under \nenvironment category A. Possible adverse impacts of project activities are expected to be \nreversible, site-specific, and small in magnitude. The PMU, AEC, and the national on-farm \nservice  provider  will  be  responsible  for  the  ESMS,  implementing  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism, implementing the monitoring plan, and reporting progress to MOAC and ADB.  \n \n29.  The gender strategy, articulated in the GESI plan, also includes a strategy for social \ninclusion of indigenous peoples and disadvantaged persons. The social impacts are expected to \nbe  positive,  especially  regarding  participation  by  women,  disadvantaged  persons,  and \nindigenous peoples, and their access to project opportunities and benefits. The previous Crop \nDiversification Project demonstrated the benefits for women and disadvantaged persons of \nintroducing HVCs, and it is envisaged that 75% or more of farmer group members will be \nfemale. The project will provide specifically designed programs to work with disadvantaged \npersons and indigenous peoples to ensure their opportunity to benefit is achieved. The  project \nis unlikely to trigger any involuntary resettlement safeguards. However, as subprojects are not \nknown at this stage and are stakeholder driven, a resettlement framework has been included in \nthe ESMS24 which outlines the triggers for, and indicative content of, a resettlement plan, in \ncase  one  is  needed.  Two  full-time  positions  are  included  in  the  PMU  for  applying  social \nsafeguards. \n \nE.  Risk and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  Risks and mitigating measures developed in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan are summarized in Table 4.25  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Main Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate attention to effective  Project  implementation  will  use  service  providers,  including  AEC,  with \nproject management may  technical backstopping from SNV and NGO service providers to offset human \nadversely impact implementation    resource  weakness  and  reduce  risk  of  inadequate  government  funding \nsources. \n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Gender and Social Inclusion Plan, and Environmental and Social \nManagement System Arrangement (Appendix 2). \n23 Environmental and Social Management Arrangement, and Disaster and Climate Change Risk Screening Results \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 No resettlement is envisaged under the project.
