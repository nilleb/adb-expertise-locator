INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  A capacity-building technical assistance (TA) project1for the National Directorate of Water \nand Sanitation (DNAS, abbreviated from the Portuguese language name) is included in the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU)  for  2006\u20132008.  The \nproposed TA is associated with the proposed Dili Urban Water and Sanitation Project (DUWSP), \ncurrently being prepared. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Dili from 24 to 31 August 2006. The \nMinister  of  Natural  Resources,  Minerals,  and  Energy  Policy  signed  the  fact-finding  mission \nmemorandum of understanding, which included a draft TA paper. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  National Water Supply and Sanitation. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target \nfor water supply in Timor-Leste is to increase from 44% to 78% the proportion of people with \nimproved access to water. The target for sanitation is to increase from 19% to 46% the proportion \nof people with improved sanitation. Only about 13% of families have connections to piped water in \ntheir homes, and 16% are served by community taps.2 Most East Timorese live in rural areas \nwhere access to safe water sources and sanitation is the worst. Because success in rural areas is \nvital  for  achieving  MDG  7  targets,  most  water  supply  and  sanitation  (watsan)  development \nassistance  in  Timor-Leste  targets  rural  communities.  Meanwhile,  Timor-Leste  is  experiencing \nsignificant rural\u2013urban migration and Dili\u2019s population is expected to increase from an estimated \n160,000 in 2006 to about 311,000 by 2020. While rapid urbanization in developing countries \ntypically brings growth and poverty reduction, it can also trap the urban poor in unhealthy and \ndemeaning  living  conditions.  Poorly  managed  urban  development,  resulting  in  backlogs  of \ninfrastructure and services, can stifle economic growth. A shortage of clean water is a frequent \nchokepoint.  \n \n3.  Water Supply in Dili. Despite significant capital investments since 1999,3 only 25\u201330% of \nthe population of Dili city is covered with 24-hour safe water supply. This proportion is well below \nthe Government\u2019s National Development Plan (NDP) sector target of 80% of the urban population \nwith access to safe piped water supply by 2020 (recently revised to 2015). More than 50% of the \nDili water supply system experiences high leakage, low or variable pressure, and intermittent \nsupply, i.e., water available for only 10\u201316 hours per day. Complaints of no water and low pressure \nmake up one third of consumer complaints. Water sources, treatment plants, and transmission \nmains have sufficient capacity to meet Dili city\u2019s water needs for several years. The primary and \nsecondary  distribution  networks  are  now  in  good  condition.  The  poor  service  levels  and  low \ncoverage of DNAS piped water are largely caused by (i) lack of tertiary pipes, (ii) poor condition of \ntertiary  pipes  and  service  connections,  and  (iii)  poor  demand  management.  Although  an \nappropriate tariff policy for urban water supply is in place, revenue generated from water sales in \nDili city covers less than 5% of water-supply-system operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.  \n \n4.  Dili Urban Water and Sanitation Project (DUWSP). The DUWSP Fact-Finding Mission in \nJune 2005 established the rationale for an ADB-supported watsan project for Dili. So long as \nDNAS  is  unable  to  deliver  a  reliable  supply  of  piped  water  in  Dili,  (i)  DNAS  will\n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 25 September 2006. \n2  United Nations Development Programme. 2004. Timor-Leste Human Development Report: Paths out of Poverty. Dili. \n3  $30 million has been invested in water production, primary and secondary distribution, and connections; $5 million has \nbeen spent on establishing and strengthening DNAS.   \n ", "2   \nfail financially and technically, (ii) DNAS will be unable to support watsan services in district \ncenters, (iii) benefits from capital investments will not be protected, and (iv) the Government will \nhave  no  means  of  sustaining  its  urban  and  rural  NDP  watsan  targets.  On  this  basis,  the \nGovernment and ADB approved a project preparation TA for DUWSP, which is ongoing. The \nproposed DUWSP would commence in 2007 and by focusing on tertiary distribution and demand \nmanagement it would complement Dili water supply improvements financed by the Government of \nJapan. DUWSP aims to improve water supply infrastructure and reduce nonrevenue water (NRW) \nthrough leak detection and associated physical works in one to three of Dili\u2019s 10 water supply \nzones.  DUWSP  will  apply  a  \u201czonal  approach\u201d,  i.e.,  subdivide  the  network  into  smaller,  more \nmanageable, hydraulically isolated zones and subzones, controlled by valves and meters. It will \nfocus  on  improving  water  supply\u2014mainly  tertiary  pipes,  meters  (initially  for  commercial, \ninstitutional, formal housing, and communal/bulk customers), valve and pressure management, \nrevenue collection, and customer relations in one to three selected zones, which will serve as \nmodels for replication in other zones. \n \n5.  DNAS Performance. Staff shortages4 and low skill levels hinder DNAS from managing its \nDili water supply system efficiently, and contribute to low levels of service and poor organization \nperformance. Staff shortages are evident in most areas of DNAS operations, particularly operation \nand  maintenance  of  engineering  infrastructure,  customer  services,  financial  management, \nmetering, and water quality testing. DNAS lacks accountability to the Government, to customers, \nand to the public. Neither DNAS nor the Government adequately monitors the organization\u2019s \nperformance.  Dili  city  water  operations  data  are  not  collated,  analyzed,  and  reported  in  a \nsystematic way, and are often outdated. \n \n6.  The Government of Japan implemented the Project for Improvement of Water Supply in Dili \nin 2005, providing capacity development and training to DNAS staff in (i) planning of distribution \nand service pipes, and (ii) preparation of customer logbooks. The project helped DNAS to update \nthe pipe network and customer logbook information for Zone 1, prepare a customer database for \nmost of Dili city in geographic information system (GIS) format, and provide GIS training and \ntechnology transfer to five DNAS staff. The work, however, is incomplete. GIS maps, GIS software, \nand data files are not yet available to operations staff. Likewise, the project\u2019s AutoCAD engineering \ndrawings  covering  most  of  Dili  water  supply  infrastructure  are  not  yet  standardized  or \nsystematically registered on networked computers. Follow-up support from the Government of \nJapan will enable DNAS to finish this work by March 2007, but DNAS will need ongoing help to \nsustain these systems.  \n \n7.  Even before the April-May 2006 crisis, DNAS\u2019s attempts to meter, bill, and collect from its \nDili customers were not succeeding. The number of paying customers fell from about 900 in \nJanuary 2006 to 195 in March 2006. Customers were deterred from paying by the time-consuming \nbill payment procedure and other disincentives. Payments from larger commercial customers had \nincreased during 2005 but DNAS was unable to sustain the effort. Metering, billing, and collecting \nfrom commercial, institutional, and formal housing customers should be a crucial early component \nof any strategy to improve DNAS performance in Dili. \n \n8.  Strengthening  DNAS  to  Sustain  Benefits  from  DUWSP.  Organization  capacity \ndevelopment in Timor-Leste is particularly challenging because managers are inexperienced and \nfew staff are skilled or \u2018trainable\u2019. With its current management, staffing, and resources, DNAS by \nitself cannot expand and sustain watsan services in Timor-Leste\u2500the Government cannot achieve \n                                                 \n4  In 2005/2006, DNAS had 161 permanent staff, including 29 staff dedicated to Dili city water supply operations. In \n2006/07, DNAS is proposing a budget for 171 permanent staff and 56 temporary staff. These numbers include 29 \npermanent water supply operational staff and 41 temporary operations staff for Dili water supply.   \n ", "  3\nand protect its NDP targets. Therefore, through DUWSP, DNAS will recruit contract staff and \ntechnicians to help operate and maintain Dili\u2019s improved water supply network, facilities, and \nsystems. Contract staff would be retained by DNAS after the project. The capacity of DNAS \nmanagement  must  also  be  strengthened.  In  the  short  term,  the  TA  project  will  provide  an \nexperienced water utility executive and technical managers to work alongside DNAS management. \nLater, a management contract may be a possible option for DNAS. The Minister for Natural \nResources, Minerals, and Energy Policy cited the management contract procured for Timor-Leste\u2019s \nelectricity supply utility in November 2003 as a precedent. The Minister believes that DNAS and \nthe Ministry of Natural Resources, Minerals, and Energy Policy (MoNRMEP) do not need more \n\u201cadvisors\u201d. \n \n9.  Good governance and adequate operating revenues are crucial prerequisites for improving \nurban watsan services, especially for the underserved urban poor. These conditions also apply to \nDNAS, but the way forward is complicated by the social and economic disruption still widespread in \nDili. Improving water supplies in Dili will need to reflect post-crisis political, technical, financial, and \nsocial realities. A conventional strategy to install meters and to bill and collect payment from all \ncustomers will not be immediately practical in post-crisis Dili. The political will to immediately \nimprove DNAS governance is strong, but improving revenue performance requires a more gradual \nand selective strategy.  Since metering, billing, and collecting are important demand-management \nelements,  the  post-crisis  environment  in  Dili  poses  special  challenges  for  improving  DNAS \nperformance. Consumer and public satisfaction are important for success.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  expected  impact  of  the  TA  project  is  improved  water  supply  for  households, \nbusinesses, and institutions in Dili city. The expected outcome is improved performance of DNAS \nin managing and operating its Dili city water supply services. The TA project will have a primary \nfocus on improving demand management, including nonrevenue water (NRW) reduction,5 and will \nbe delivered around two components: (i) improving demand management and reducing NRW; and \n(ii) improving business planning, management, and reporting.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be associated with DUWSP. The TA consultants will help MoNRMEP and \nDNAS management (i) confirm staffing and systems requirements for Dili water operations; (ii) \nrecruit, assimilate, and manage additional staff and contract staff; (iii) design capacity-development \nprograms; and (iv) deliver on-the-job and in-house training. The TA consultants will be experienced \nwater utility executive and technical managers and will provide management support.  \n \n12.  Component  1:  Improving  Demand  Management  and  Reducing  NRW.  A  demand \nmanagement task force will be established within DNAS to focus and drive change, particularly for \nNRW reduction. Consultants from the TA project and DUWSP will provide training and continuous \ntechnical and management support to the demand management task force and to DNAS operating \nsections. The TA will help DNAS recruit, establish, and train three permanent leak detection teams \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n(18 staff) who will work with the DUWSP implementation team. The TA will upgrade the capacity of \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nDNAS\u2019s Planning and Design Division and the Dili O&M Section in water supply network analysis, \n                                                 \n5  NRW is a key indicator of overall organization performance as it integrates management, commercial, and technical \nperformance.   \n ", "4   \nAutoCAD drafting, and GIS. It will also (i) upgrade Dili city engineering infrastructure drawings, (ii) \nstrengthen  the  drawing  registration/record  system,  (iii)  install  new  networked  computers  and \nsoftware, and (iv) develop and run the Dili city hydraulic network model. Activities designed to \nstrengthen network analysis and GIS would complement those funded by the Government of \nJapan. The TA will help (i) DNAS develop meter management policies and (ii) Support Services \nSection  implement  the  program  (using  contractors).  The  TA  will  also  help  (i)  DNAS  develop \ncustomer services policies and procedures and (ii) Customer Services Section carry out customer \nregistration,  customer  surveys  and  relations,  customer  awareness,  connection  policies,  meter \nreading and billing, and installation of new billing software and computers. Metering will focus \ninitially  on  commercial  businesses,  institutions,  households  in  \u2018formal\u2019  neighborhoods,  and \ncommunal/bulk customers. The current urban water supply tariff will be reviewed and alternative \ncharging arrangements will be designed for lower-income households and groups.6 The TA will \nhelp DNAS establish bill payment centers in the east and west of Dili city. The TA and DUWSP will \nhelp  the  Planning  and  Design  and  Dili  O&M  Sections  develop  distribution  planning,  zone \nmanagement, valve and bulk meter management skills and technical standards, and will provide \ntraining and ongoing support. This will enable DNAS staff to identify subzones, valve and meter \nlocations for the DUWSP leak detection work. The TA will also help DNAS to recruit and train \npermanent subzone caretakers (approximately 10 caretakers, maximum one caretaker per 1,000 \nconnections) for the DUWSP target areas. \n \n13.  The TA project and DUWSP designs will incorporate measures to sustain NRW reduction \nbeyond project completion: (i) the demand management task force will have the mandate to \ncontinue NRW reduction work in other Dili water supply zones after DUWSP is completed; (ii) \nplanning, work plans, and targets for NRW reduction will be prepared for the next target zones; (iii) \nleak  detection  team  members  will  be  retained  as  permanent  DNAS  staff;  (iv)  procurement7 \ncontracts will be let, DUWSP implementation members retained, and funding committed for NRW \nreduction work in the future target zones; (v) consultants will be engaged by the Government to \nassist  with  future  NRW  work;  and  (vi)  permanent  subzone  caretakers  will  carry  out  NRW \nmonitoring and control after the projects are completed.  \n \n14.  Component 2: Capacity Development for Improved Business Planning, Management, \nand Reporting. The TA consultants will provide training and ongoing management support for \ncapacity development. The TA will upgrade the capacity of DNAS senior managers in strategic and \nannual  business  planning,  human  resources  management  and  development,  staffing  needs \nanalysis and organization structure, financial management, management information systems, and \nperformance benchmarking. It will assist DNAS (i) to develop formats for a strategic business plan \nwith annual rollovers and a monthly management report; and (ii) to identify and implement required \ndata  collection,  business  process,  and  information  system  changes.  The  TA  will  include  a \ncomprehensive and detailed assessment of DNAS staffing needs (i) to support the DUWSP, and \n(ii) to carry out the Dili city water supply business. The assessment report will confirm staffing and \nskills deficiencies, recommend a costed recruitment plan, and outline a training program. The TA \nwould be consistent with an eventual ministerial capacity-development action plan8 for MoNRMEP. \n \n                                                 \n6  Many European and United Kingdom cities do not meter residential customers. Instead, they charge flat rate tariffs, \nwithout encountering profligate water usage. Water \u201cliterate\u201d customers make this possible. The same approach in Dili \nwould not by itself contain profligate water consumption, including irrigating urban crops. The tariff could be revised to \nencourage domestic consumers to choose metering. As is typical in many low-income cities, the broad lifeline tariff in \nDili is resulting in the non-poor capturing subsidies.  \n7  Procurement contracts cover (i) pipe, valve, and meter supply; (ii) leak repairs; (iii) pipe replacement; (iv) pipe \ninstallation; (v) valve and meter installation; (vi) valve and meter chamber construction; and (vii) service connection \nand customer meter installation. \n8  Ministerial capacity-development action plans are planned for all ministries, guided by the Capacity Development \nCoordination Unit, Office of the Prime Minister. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000. ADB will provide $1,000,000, while the \nGovernment will provide $200,000 in kind to cover mainly office accommodation and remuneration \nof counterpart staff. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by \nthe Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MoNRMEP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  TA,  providing  day-to-day \nimplementation counterpart support through DNAS. The DNAS Director will be the Government\u2019s \nTA project director, and the DNAS chief of urban water supply will be the day-to-day counterpart of \nthe TA consultant team leader. The TA consultants will work alongside the DUWSP implementation \nteam  (consultants,  DNAS  staff  and  contract  personnel).  The  Corporate  Services  Division  of \nMoNRMEP will provide monitoring and oversight support and will report to the Minister. The TA is \nexpected to begin in June 2007 and to be completed in December 2009.    \n \n17.  ADB will select and engage a team of international consultants (50 person-months) in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The international consulting firm will \nbe recruited using ADB\u2019s quality-based approach to guarantee that the consultants and proposed \napproach  can  deliver  the  specialized  capacity-development  support  required.  The  simplified \ntechnical proposal format will be used to invite and evaluate proposals from international consulting \nfirms.  The  water  utility  management  specialist  will  be  the  team  leader.  Other  international \nconsultants  will  be  (i)  a  systems  accounting  specialist,  (ii)  a  water  utility  technician  (meter \nmanagement), (iii) a water utility drafter (drawing office systems), and (iv) a network modeling \nengineer. Appendix 3 gives the outline terms of reference for the consultants. Equipment for the TA \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and procedures acceptable to \nADB and will be retained by the EA after the TA. Equipment costs are in Appendix 2. To facilitate \nimplementation, the TA will use an advance-payment facility for training, seminars, conferences \nand surveys. The amount of the advance and its liquidation will be arranged in line with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grant. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s water team in the Regional and Sustainable Development Department will help \ndocument and disseminate the results, experiences, and lessons learned from the TA\u2019s demand \nmanagement and NRW reduction work.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Timor-Leste for Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved WS services for  Percentage of the  DNAS customer registration,  \u2022  Government replicates new \nhouseholds, businesses,  population of Dili city with  consumption records, and  WS infrastructure \nand institutions in Dili city  24-hour piped water supply  field surveys  improvements in all 10 Dili \n  increased from 25% in    city WS zones. \n2006 to 80% by year 2015     \n     \u2022  Government allocates \nCustomer satisfaction with  DNAS customer complaints  DNAS revenues to finance \nDili city piped WS services  records  DNAS operations and \nimproved, with less than    system improvement and/or \n180 complaints per 1,000  Structured customer surveys  expansion. \ncustomers per year by 2015     \n    \u2022  Government remains \ncommitted to strengthening \nDNAS.  \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved DNAS  NRW ratio for Dili city  DNAS customer, billing,  \u2022  Government is committed \norganization performance in  reduced from 95% to 40\u2013 production, and consumption  to develop DNAS Dili city \nits Dili city WS business  50%, citywide, by month 30   records (see Note 3)  WS operation into an \n      efficient, commercially \n  Monthly water sales  DNAS monthly billing records  focused WS business. \nrevenue for Dili city reaches  and CFET/MPF monthly   \n$20,000, by month 30  records of water sales (see  \u2022  MoNRMEP monitors and \n  Note 4)   holds DNAS accountable \nOperating cost coverage is    for the performance of its \n40%, citywide, by month 30    Dili city WS business. \n(early focus on commercial,     \ninstitutional, formal housing,    \u2022  Upgraded skills and \nand communal/bulk    systems will be applied in \ncustomers)    target zones and citywide, \n     as appropriate. \nProcurement contracts let,  Procurement contracts and \nNRW targets set, and work  monthly NRW task force \nplans in place for ongoing  reports (see Note 5)  \nleak detection and NRW   \nreduction work in future \ntarget zones, by month 30 \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement technical assistance (TA) aims to improve \nthe performance of the National Directorate of Water Supply and Sanitation (DNAS) in managing \nand operating its Dili city water supply services. The TA will be focused primarily on improving \ndemand management, including nonrevenue water (NRW) reduction,1 and will be delivered around \ntwo  components:  (i)  improving  demand  management  and  reducing  NRW;  and  (ii)  improving \nbusiness planning, management, and reporting. The TA will be implemented in association with the \nDili Urban Water and Sanitation Project (DUWSP).2 With its current levels of management, staffing, \nand resources, DNAS by itself cannot expand and sustain water supplies in Dili. So, through \nDUWSP, DNAS  will recruit contract staff and technicians to help operate and maintain Dili\u2019s \nimproved water supply network, facilities, and systems. Contract staff will be retained by DNAS \nafter  the  project.  To  strengthen  management  capacity,  the  Government  may  consider  a \nmanagement  contract  in  the  medium-term.  In  the  meantime,  a  TA  package  is  needed  to \nsupplement DNAS management. DNAS needs an experienced water utility executive and technical \nmanagers who can work alongside DNAS managers. \n \n2.  The TA is expected to be implemented over 30 months beginning in 2007, and will be \nassociated with DUWSP. The TA consultants will help the Ministry of Natural Resources, Minerals, \nand  Energy  Policy  (MoNRMEP)  and  DNAS  management  (i)  confirm  staffing  and  systems \nrequirements for Dili water operations; (ii) recruit, assimilate, and manage additional staff and \ncontract staff; (iii) design capacity-development programs; and (iv) deliver on-the-job and in-house \ntraining. TA consultants will be an experienced water utility executive and technical managers and \nwill provide ongoing management and technical support. The scope of consulting services will \ncover both TA components (para. 1). International consultants will be engaged to provide a total of \n50 person-months as follows. \n \nA.  Scope of Consulting Services \n \n  1.  Supporting Demand Management and NRW Reduction (42 person-months) \n \n3.  The TA consultants will: \n  \n(i)  undertake a comprehensive assessment of the skills levels, systems, and practices \nof DNAS Dili city operating sections;  \n(ii)  design capacity upgrading programs in collaboration with MoNRMEP and DNAS \nmanagers; \n(iii)  assist DNAS to establish a demand management task force with agreed objective, \nmandate, and operating procedures; \n(iv)  assist DNAS to recruit three leak detection teams (18 staff) and subzone caretakers \n(approximately 13 staff) with agreed duty statements;  \n(v)  provide ongoing management and technical support to the demand management \ntask force and DUWSP implementation team; and \n(vi)  provide on-the-job and in-house training, together with ongoing management and \ntechnical  support  to  DNAS  operating  sections,  to  support  NRW  reduction  and \nongoing  operations  in  the  following  areas:  (a)  hydraulic  network  modeling, \nengineering  drawing  and  record  systems,  computer  and  software  upgrades  for \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n1  NRW is a key indicator of overall organization performance as it integrates management, commercial, and technical \nperformance.   \n2  DUWSP is a proposed investment project to be funded by a grant from the Asian Development Bank and a budget \nallocation from the Government of Timor-Leste.  \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nDNAS  technical  operations  (network  analysis,  AutoCAD,  and  GIS  software); \n(b) meter management including meter database, management practices/policies, \ntest  bench  installation  and  commissioning,  meter  and  service  connection \ninstallation;  (c)  customer  services  including  customer  services  policies  and \nprocedures,    customer  registration,  customer  surveys  and  relations,  customer \nawareness, connection policies, new billing software and hardware, meter reading, \nand billing, and new bill payment centers in the east and west of Dili city, and (d) \ndistribution planning and management, including zone and subzone planning, zone \nmanagement, valve and bulk meter management, and technical standards. Because \nDili city experienced major social and economic disruption during much of 2006, it \nwould be impractical to implement a mass meter installation program across all \nclasses  of  customers.  The  TA  will  initially  focus  on  metering  commercial, \ninstitutional,  formal  housing,  and  communal/bulk  customers.  All  registered \ncustomers should be billed, but probably not all can be metered by the conclusion of \nthe TA.    \n \n  2.  Management, Human Resources, and Reporting (8 person-months) \n \n4.  The TA consultants will: \n \n(i)  undertake a comprehensive assessment of the skills levels of DNAS Dili city senior \nmanagers;  \n(ii)  assess business planning, management, and reporting systems;  \n(iii)  design capacity upgrading programs in collaboration with MoNRMEP and DNAS \nmanagers;  \n(iv)  provide on-the-job and in-house training, together with ongoing management and \ntechnical support to DNAS senior managers, in the following areas: (a) human \nresources  management  and  development,  staffing  needs,  and  organization \nstructure; (b) business planning; (c) financial management; and (d) management \ninformation systems and benchmarking;  \n(v)  assist DNAS to prepare its strategic business plan and annual rollovers;  \n(vi)  assist  DNAS  to  develop  a  monthly  management  reporting  system,  implement \nroutine data collection activities, prepare monthly management reports, and ensure \nintegration  with  \u2018Free  Balance\u2019,  the  whole-of-government  financial  management \ninformation system administered by the Ministry of Planning and Finance;  \n(vii)  assist DNAS to review and update duty statements of key Dili city water supply staff \nto reflect their new functions and responsibilities; and  \n(viii)  assist DNAS to undertake a detailed staffing needs analysis and report for Dili water \nsupply operations.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n5.  MoNRMEP will be the Executing Agency for the TA, providing day-to-day implementation \ncounterpart  support  through  DNAS.  The  DNAS  Director  will  be  the  Government\u2019s  TA  project \ndirector, and the DNAS chief of urban water supply will be the day-to-day counterpart of the TA \nconsultant team leader. MoNRMEP is planning to establish a whole-of-sector project management \noperations unit covering all capital works programs in the water supply and sanitation (watsan) and \npower sectors. This project management operations unit will be located within the new Corporate \nServices Division and will handle all aspects of project management, including procurement and \ncontract management, for all capital programs in the watsan and power sectors. The unit will \nsupport and oversee both TA and DUWSP implementation and will offer a reporting mechanism to \n ", "    Appendix 3  13\nthe Minister. The TA and DUWSP teams will work towards common outputs under the demand \nmanagement and NRW reduction program.  \n \nC.  Reporting Requirements \n \n6.  The consultants will prepare: \n \n(i)  an inception report by the end of week 6 covering the following: (a) confirmation of \nTA rationale and design; (b) proceedings of the project orientation workshop for \nMoNRMEP and DNAS managers and demand management task force members; \n(c) technical skills assessment of Support Services, Customer Services, Planning \nand Design, and Dili O&M sections; and (d) assessment of practices and systems in \nthese sections; \n(ii)  quarterly progress reports; \n(iii)  a  first  annual  report  covering  the  following:  (a)  consolidated  progress  against \nactivities and milestones; (b) confirmation of validity of TA assumptions, and impact \nof risks; and (c) progress against TA outputs; \n(iv)  a second annual report combined with a draft final report covering the following: (a) \nconsolidated progress against activities and milestones; (b) confirmation of validity \nof  TA  assumptions,  and  impact  of  risks;  (c)  progress  against  TA  outputs  and \nassessment  of  TA  success;  (d)  recommendations  for  follow-on  capacity \ndevelopment; and (e) lessons learned from the TA; and \n(v)  a final report that incorporates comments on the draft final report from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and the Government. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061207153358+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061122102404+08'00'", "Title": "Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Author": ""}}
