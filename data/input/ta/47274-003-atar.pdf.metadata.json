THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The project will support environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive development in \nthe cities of Ha Giang, Hue, and Vinh Yen in Viet Nam to enhance their economic competitiveness. \nIt will (i) control urban stormwater runoff and reduce flood risks, (ii) improve sanitation for public \nhealth, (iii) enhance green landscaping and public amenities, (iv) upgrade urban road networks \nand  their  connectivity,  and  (v)  promote  public  participation  in  planning.  The  project  will \ndemonstrate green and climate-resilient development approaches that will be scaled up for \nnationwide secondary green city development in Viet Nam. This technical assistance (TA) will \nprovide much needed capacity development support. \n \n2.  Development constraints. Because of rapid urbanization, 31.1 million people live in cities \nin Viet Nam, and they contributed about 70% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 2015 \n($193.4 billion).1 Although a structural shift from agriculture to industry and services is driving Viet \nNam\u2019s rapid growth, the country\u2019s urbanization is uneven because development of secondary \ncities is lagging.2 In secondary cities, only 10% of their urban wastewater is treated by a \ncentralized system, and domestic wastewater treatment relies heavily on poorly maintained \nhousehold septic tanks. The lack of proper stormwater management has reduced the capacity of \ndrainage systems and causes frequent flooding. Many urban road networks reach their capacity \nand have difficulty accommodating an increasing number of vehicles. Moreover, climate change \ncan severely impact secondary cities regardless of their location. By 2100, a projected sea-level \nrise of 100 centimeters could flood a 40,000-square-kilometer area and affect an estimated 9 \nmillion\u201311 million people.3. \n \n3.  Government effort and challenges. Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Strategy, \n2011\u20132020 aims to sustain economic growth rates while achieving social inclusiveness and \nenvironmental protection.4 This has led the government to issue the National Program on Urban \nDevelopment,  and  to  guide  efficient,  sustainable,  and  equitable  urbanization. 5  However, \nsecondary cities are constrained by the lack of financial resources and local investment because \nof insufficient basic urban infrastructure and services.6 Infrastructure development in these cities \nrelies heavily on public investment as their limited size and coverage cannot support economies \nof scale or cost recovery. Yet, their weak capacity to plan, design, and prioritize investments \nprevents the efficient use of public funds and application of innovative ideas. Secondary cities\u2019 \nslow development prevents them from contributing to the national socioeconomic growth, through \n(i) providing job opportunities and livable environments for locals and migrant workers; and (ii) \nminimizing income disparities by supporting the growth of middle-income groups \n \n4.  The government requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which \nhas been supporting the comprehensive basic urban infrastructure development in secondary \n                                                \n \n1  Government of Viet Nam, General Statistics Office of Viet Nam. 2016. Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2015. Ha Noi. \nUrbanization is increasing at a rate of 4.0% per year, much faster than the national population growth rate of 1.1%. \n2  A secondary city generally has a population of 50,000\u2013300,000. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009.

Ha Noi (Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 445/2009). \n6  Due to the government\u2019s financial decentralization policy, many local governments have had to confront large \nfinancial deficits stemming from reduced fiscal budget transfers and limited sources of own fiscal revenue. \n ", "2 \ncities since 2003.7 ADB has found that responding to complex socioeconomic and financial \nconstraints requires strategic support in upstream city planning, and the identification of prioritized \nand effective investments for cities. ADB selected Ha Giang, Hue, and Vinh Yen as demonstration \ncities because they represent different socioeconomic characteristics, development constraints \nand priorities, and geographic locations; and supported the preparation of a GrEEEn city action \nplan (GCAP) for each city.8 The GCAPs mainstreamed integrated urban planning and the \npreparation of an investment framework to boost the cities\u2019 economic competitiveness while \nincorporating  climate  resilience,  social  inclusiveness,  and  environmental  sustainability  in \ninfrastructure planning and development. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  solution  builds  on  knowledge  work  and \naddresses complex secondary city development issues through TA and loan projects. The project \ncomponents were selected based on ADB\u2019s capacity development TA9 that conceptualized, \nanalyzed, and integrated green and climate-resilient development approaches in cities. Project \npreparatory TA10 refined the GCAPs and prioritized investment for city development. The project \nimpact  will  be  the  improved  efficiency,  sustainability,  and  equitability  of  secondary  cities \ndevelopment in Viet Nam. The project outcome will be strengthened environmental sustainability, \ninclusiveness, and climate resilience of Ha Giang, Hue, and Vinh Yen. The project is estimated \nto cost $223.9 million. The government has requested (i) a regular loan of $50 million and (ii) \nconcessional loan of $120 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. \nThe Global Environment Facility (GEF) will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $2.0 million \nand the UCCRTF under the UFPF will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $4.0 million, both \nto be administered by ADB, pursuant to terms and conditions set forth in the grant agreements. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n6.  The challenge of mainstreaming the green city development approach in Viet Nam stems \nfrom (i) the slow uptake of the national-level policy framework to build an enabling environment \nto promote green city development, (ii) limited human and financial capacity at the provincial and \ncity levels to build an adequate pool of successful models, and (iii) insufficient analysis of \ninnovative approaches for green and climate-resilient development in the project cities. The \nproposed TA will help refine, scale up, and strengthen foundations for promoting green city \ndevelopment in Viet Nam. It will build on ADB\u2019s past and ongoing knowledge and financial support. \nThe TA attached to the project will leverage the project impact by (i) updating and refining the \nGCAPs and improving overall city master plans for Ha Giang, Hue, and Vinh Yen; (ii) replicating \nthe approach to secondary city development elsewhere in Viet Nam; and (iii) mainstreaming \nintegrated green and climate-resilient development through national policy and regulatory reform. \nThe TA will be managed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), the \nkey central agency to coordinate and promote national climate resilience in Viet Nam.11 \n                                                \n \n7  ADB. 2003.
