Building the capacity of Pacific audit institutions is fundamental to improving governance \nin  the  region,  and  high-quality  external  audit  is  an  essential  requirement  for  creating \ntransparency in the use of public funds. \n \n2.  In October 2005, Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders endorsed for further study and \nanalysis the Pacific Plan Initiative 12.1 (Key Integrity Institutions), which included the Pacific \nRegional Audit Initiative (PRAI).1 The PRAI design was subsequently developed by the Pacific \nAssociation of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI),2 with support from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and Australian Aid, under the coordination of the PIF Secretariat.3 The August 2008 \nPIF Leaders\u2019 Meeting endorsed the PRAI design. Following this endorsement, ADB, Australian \nAid,  the  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  (INTOSAI)  Development \nInitiative, the New Zealand Aid Programme, and the World Bank supported the successful initial \nimplementation and delivery of PRAI outputs during 2008\u20132013.4 \n \n3.  This proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will support the \ncontinued implementation of the PRAI in Pacific island countries, and has been developed in \nconsultation with the PASAI secretariat and development partners. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The  overarching  objective  of  the  PRAI  is  to  raise  Pacific  public  auditing  by  audit \ninstitutions (known as supreme audit institutions [SAIs]) to uniformly high standards. This in turn \nwill  contribute  to  good  governance  through  improved  transparency,  accountability,  and \nefficiency in the management and use of public resources in the Pacific island countries. \n \n5.  Pacific SAIs face similar difficulties in the areas of human resource capacity and the \neffectiveness  of  their  audit  methodologies,  systems,  and  governing  legislation.  Common \nchallenges include small numbers of trained and qualified personnel, disproportionate effects of \nstaff turnover or absences, outdated audit methodologies, inefficient governance arrangements, \nand legislation that does not provide for the appropriate independence of the audit function. \nThese issues mean that public accounts are often not audited to high standards in a timely \nmanner, and legislatures do not always act on audit findings and recommendations. To be \neffective, SAIs must (i) audit all entities within the audit portfolio, (ii) issue timely audit opinions \n                                                \n1  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2005.

PASAI operates \na small secretariat currently located in Auckland, New Zealand. Supreme audit institutions from ADB member \ncountries that are members of PASAI and will be supported by this TA are the Cook Islands, the Federated States \nof Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \nTonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n3 ADB. 2006.

The PASAI Annual Report 2011/12 provides a comprehensive outline of achievements \nfrom the PRAI to date and notes the improvements to capacity and associated audit impacts.6 It \ndescribes the following outputs. \n \n(i)  Regional cooperation and coordination. Under this output (a) four manuals \ncovering human resources management, quality assurance guidelines, reporting \nguidelines, and performance audit were produced and are being used by audit \ninstitutions  in  the  region;  (b)  three  regional  cooperative  performance  audits \ncovering  solid  waste,  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  and  management  of \nsustainable fisheries were completed; and (c) annual PASAI congresses were \nheld to support regional coordination on audit issues. \n(ii)  Organizational  capacity.  Training  workshops  on  auditing  fundamentals, \nintermediate  auditing,  supervisory  auditing,  and  audit  management  were \ndeveloped, piloted, and conducted with a total of 101 staff trained from 17 audit \ninstitutions in the Pacific island countries. A total of 15 coordinators from within \nthe region were involved. \n(iii)  Technical  ability.  Under  this  output  the  subregional  audit  support  (SAS) \nprogram was completed. The SAS program uses an innovative model to deal \nwith public auditing challenges in small island states by pooling the resources of \nthe subregion. The program is working to raise the quality of public auditing in \nKiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu through the establishment of a team of secondees \nfrom each of the participating countries, supported by specialist audit expertise. \n(iv)  Transparency  and  accountability.  A  second  report  on  the  state  of \naccountability and transparency in the Pacific island countries was published by \nPASAI in July 2012.7 The report is being used to communicate with governments \nand regional organizations, and to conduct broader advocacy about the role of \nSAIs and associated governance mechanisms in achieving the accountable and \ntransparent use of public resources. \n \n7.  A key initiative introduced in late 2012 is a twinning arrangement, which potentially lays \nthe groundwork for an eventual exit strategy by PASAI from development partner support. The \ntwinning arrangement teams an audit institution from Australia (including the Australian state \naudit institutions) or New Zealand with a developing country PASAI member. The twinning \narrangements will develop in various ways depending on the needs of each audit institution; \nhowever, they will include the provision of mentoring, advice, training, and knowledge sharing \nbetween the more developed audit institution and the PASAI member. \n \n8.  The  PRAI  was,  and  remains,  highly  consistent  with  regional  priorities.  It  was \nconceptualized in response to growing regional concern, as articulated by PIF leaders, that \ninstitutional weaknesses were undermining transparency, accountability, equity, and efficiency \nin the management and use of resources in the Pacific island countries; and with the belief that \na  regional  approach  could  be  taken  to  addressing  these  issues.  The  PRAI  design  was \ndeveloped  by  PASAI  after  an  extensive  consultation  process  and  significant  background \ndiagnostic studies. These assessments included undertaking detailed SAI-specific stock takes, \n                                                \n6  PASAI. 2012. Annual Report 2011/12. Auckland. \n7  PASAI. 2012. Accountability and Transparency in the Pacific Region 2011. Auckland. \n ", "  3 \nbuilding on earlier SAI assessments, along with regional benchmarking of capacity through the \nPASAI capability model.8 \n \n9.  An independent review of the PRAI and PASAI was undertaken by ADB\u2019s Independent \nEvaluation Department (IED) at the request of and in coordination with the Government of \nAustralia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the New Zealand Aid Programme.9 The \nreview gave PRAI an overall assessment of generally successful. The PRAI was rated highly \nrelevant, effective (on major outputs), efficient, and likely to be sustainable. The IED review \nprovided lessons for the next PRAI program period, including the need for (i) stronger and more \nfrequent diagnostic assessments of SAIs, including self-assessments, to improve monitoring \nand sharpen targeting of support; (ii) more proactive approaches to advocating transparency \nand accountability and to working with governments and legislatures to address long-standing \nconstraints to SAI effectiveness; (iii) reporting more regularly on transparency and accountability \nissues;  and  (iv)  establishing  formal,  results-oriented  agreements  between  PASAI  and  key \npartners  such  as  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  the  Pacific  Financial \nTechnical Assistance Centre (PFTAC). \n \n10.  PASAI  has  now  prepared  a  new  strategic  plan  in  consultation  with  member  audit \ninstitutions  that  incorporates  the  findings  of  the  IED  review.10 The  plan\u2019s  approach  was \nendorsed by PASAI members in September 2013. \n \n11.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach,  2010\u20132014,  which  identifies \ncontinued  support  to  good  governance  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration  activities, \nincluding public financial management (PFM).11 Also, in supporting regional and international \ndeclarations on development partner coordination and aid effectiveness, development partners \nhave committed to relying on country PFM systems, including audit institutions.12 Furthermore, \nADB  is  a  signatory  to  the  memorandum  of  understanding  between  INTOSAI  and  the \ndevelopment  partner  community,  under  which  development  partners  have  committed  to \nsupporting the strengthening of PFM in partner countries, including the government auditing \nfunction, with a view to ensuring that public resources are properly used, and that funding \nreaches the intended end user.13 \n \n12.  The proposed TA complements other support being provided to PFM in the Pacific \ndeveloping member countries, including by PFTAC.14 PFTAC provides PFM support in three \nareas:  (i)  support  for  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessments  and  the \ndevelopment of PFM road maps; (ii) PFM TA missions or training designed to assess, discuss, \nand deliver solutions; and (iii) delivering training and supporting the development of regional \ninstitutions or processes with the aim of ensuring long-term PFM system sustainability. Support \nto audit institutions is, however, not covered by PFTAC. \n \n \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2008.

Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA will support public entities in Pacific island countries to improve transparency \nand accountability in the management and use of their public resources. The outcome of the TA \nwill be that SAIs in Pacific island countries will operate in accordance with uniform standards at \na measurably higher level. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will deliver the following outputs and associated activities during 2014\u20132016, \nconsistent with PASAI\u2019s new strategic plan. \n \n(i)  Strengthened supreme audit institution independence. The TA will assist the \nPASAI secretariat in providing support to SAIs that need to have their audit \nlegislation revised or enhanced to improve accountability and transparency.15 \nSome SAIs in the Pacific island countries have yet to obtain full independence, a \ncomplete mandate encompassing the entire public sector, unrestricted access to \ninformation, and freedom from restrictions to report on their work. \n(ii)  Strengthened  transparency  and  accountability  by  contributing  to  and \npromoting an integrated approach to public financial management. The TA \nwill support the PASAI secretariat in continuing to regularly survey and report on \nthe  status  of transparency  and  accountability  in  the  Pacific  island  countries. \nConsistent with the recommendations in the IED review, the report will be used to \ninform stakeholders and advocate the significance of good accountability and \ntransparency. In addition, PASAI, together with key partners, will start working \ntoward a more integrated regional approach to strengthening the accountability \nsystem. \n(iii)  Strengthened  public  financial  reporting,  public  audit,  and  legislative \noversight. The TA will continue to support two initiatives that have demonstrated \nresults under phase 1\u2014cooperative audits and the SAS program. Cooperative \naudits involve multiple audit institutions working together on a single audit. They \nalso enable high-quality audit services to be delivered, particularly in specialist or \ncomplex areas, and support effective capacity development. The TA will continue \nto support the completion of cooperative performance audits using this approach. \nThe TA will also support the SAS program for Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu; and \nmay add a fourth country. \n(iv)  Strengthened capacity and capability of supreme audit institutions to carry \nout their mandates. Under phase 1 of the TA, SAIs were provided with advice \nand support on strategic and corporate planning; records management; internal \nperformance  management  and  reporting;  and  human  resources,  legal, \ninformation  and  communication  technology,  and  funding  models.  These \nrequirements  and  other  management  and  operational  best  practices  are \ncontained in the PASAI Strategic Management and Operational Guidelines. The \nTA will continue to assist SAIs in the development of strategic and business \nplans  consistent  with  the  guidelines,  or  provide  advice  where  necessary  to \n                                                \n15 Consistent  with  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  Resolution  on  SAIs  (resolution  A/66/209)  and  the \nInternational Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions. \n ", "  5 \nensure  that  the  plans  align  with  PASAI  initiatives,  as  well  as  the  INTOSAI \nperformance measurement framework.16 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  PASAI  secretariat  and \nparticipating SAIs will provide in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2. The PASAI secretariat is currently consulting with other development partners on \nits new strategic plan to also provide financing to support the continued implementation of the \nPRAI. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency and the PASAI secretariat will be the implementing \nagency.17 Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The equipment will \nbe purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time \nto time). \n \n17.  The TA will require international consultants (estimated 30 person-months of inputs) and \nnational consultants (estimated 24 person-months of inputs) with skills and expertise in public \nauditing, performance auditing, legal and governance support, capacity development, and TA \nadministration. All consultants will be engaged on an individual basis.18 The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). TA activities will be implemented over 30 months, from 1 January \n2014 to 30 June 2016. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  Monitoring of the broader aims of the TA will draw on the findings of assessments by \nADB and development partners. This will include measuring the performance of each PASAI \nmember against the PASAI capability model. Ongoing monitoring of activities will be undertaken \nthrough regular meetings of the PASAI governing board.19 Good practices and lessons will be \ndisseminated throughout the implementation of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,300,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Implementing the Pacific Regional \nAudit Initiative (Phase 2), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n16 INTOSAI.  2013.
