THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Analysis of Key Issues \n \n1.  Central and West Asia (CWA) countries have been experiencing growth in the past five \nyears, albeit at varying levels.  However, within each country, the benefits are not equally shared \nby all. Despite their high educational attainment and participation in economic activities, working \nwomen generally receive 40% less than the salaries received by men.1 Women in Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyz Republic are 40% more likely to be unemployed than their \nmale counterparts. Women often work in the agriculture and service sectors which pay lower \nwages compared to jobs in industry.  There are less women managers of medium and large \nenterprises or that hold management positions in government, especially in infrastructure sectors \nsuch as the energy, water, or the transport ministries. Job segregation and wage discrimination \naccount for lower representation of women in higher-paying sectors and for the wage gap \nbetween sexes. A limited range of employment opportunities is available to women.2 The wage \ngap is associated with gender specialization in tertiary education and women\u2019s burden of doing \ndomestic and care work in their prime child-bearing years.  Decrease in social infrastructure \nprovisions and social services restrict women\u2019s participation in wage employment.3  \n \n2.  While all CWA countries are committed to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs), including SDG 5 on gender equality, they need support in mainstreaming gender equality \ngoals especially in the infrastructure sectors, as well as in finance and public sector management.  \nInvestments by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in these areas have often tried to mainstream \ngender but have not always been successful. Of the 155 ongoing ADB projects in CWA, 37% are \nin the transport sector, 21% are in the energy sector, and 12% are in finance and public sector \nmanagement \u2013 totaling 70% of projects in the most challenging sectors for gender mainstreaming. \nSectors such as agriculture and natural resources, water supply and urban development, as well \nas the social sectors have been successful in incorporating gender in project design, as direct \ncommunity interface presents gender mainstreaming opportunities. To address the challenges \nfaced in mainstreaming gender in the infrastructure and finance and public management sectors, \ninitiatives under  the regional technical assistance (TA) on Strengthening Gender-Inclusive \nGrowth  in  Central  and  West  Asia 4 demonstrated  effective  gender  mainstreaming  (EGM) \napproaches in energy, transport, and finance and public sector management, and addressed \nsome of the gender capacity building and policy support needs of executing and implementing \nagencies. The proposed transaction TA cluster will build on the lessons from the implementation \nof the regional TA, to inform the design of ensuing gender-responsive transaction TA subprojects. \n \nB.  Justification for Cluster Modality \n \n3.  The  transaction TA cluster will provide gender capacity building support and policy advice, \nas well as implement a gender component in each of the following ensuing sovereign projects:  (i) \nBatumi\u2012Sarpi  Bypass  Road  Project  (Georgia),  (ii)  Kyzylorda\u2012Zhezkazgan  Road  Project \n(Kazakhstan),  (iii)  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (Tajikistan),  (iv)  Bukhara\u2012Miskin\u2012\nUrgench\u2012Khiva Railway Electrification Project (Uzbekistan), (v) Mortgage Market Development \n \n1  UNESCAP. 2018.

The transaction TA cluster will address these gender \nmainstreaming challenges, by supporting gender components of ensuing projects. These gender \ncomponents are aligned with the gender focus area under Strategy 2030 on Operational Priority \n2 Gender Mainstreaming Approaches, and SDG 5 on Transformative Gender Agenda.5 Details \nof ensuing projects are in Appendix 1. Support from the transaction TA cluster is envisaged to \nimprove  CWRD\u2019s  gender  mainstreaming  performance  at-entry  and  at-exit,  and  help  the \ndepartment meet its gender targets.6  \n \n4.  The transaction TA cluster will also provide capacity building support to executing and \nimplementing agencies of ongoing sovereign projects with gender mainstreaming. Most ongoing \ngender equity (GEN)/EGM projects have difficulties implementing their gender action plans due \nto the weak gender capacities of implementing agencies.  This may be attributed to the weak \ngender mainstreaming capacities of executing agencies (EAs)/implementing agencies (IAs), \nincluding the lack of gender integration in their policies, programs, projects, and services.  The \ntransaction TA cluster will strengthen their gender capacities through provision of customized \nlearning programs and provision of technical guidance and thereby improve the implementation \nand  monitoring  of  the  project  gender  action  plans  (GAPs).  The  ADB\u2019s  Corporate  Results \nFramework  2019\u20122024  includes  enhanced  gender  targets  and  indicators  that  need  to  be \nmonitored and reported on.7 There are 103 ongoing projects with gender targets and indicators \nthat need to be monitored. The transaction TA cluster will support the tracking of gender indicators \nand targets of ongoing projects. Due to its regional nature, the proposed transaction TA cluster is \nnot included in a country operations business plan (COBP). \n \n5.  The advantage of a regional transaction TA cluster over the previous regional capacity \ndevelopment TA (footnote 2) is the ability of the transaction TA cluster to support the integration \nof gender components into ADB projects and programs that are difficult to engender, such as in \nenergy, transport, and finance and public sector management.  At the same time, the transaction \nTA cluster allows for the continuing gender capacity building and policy development of sector \nministries in connection with specific ADB projects, and is therefore a more effective modality than \na knowledge and support TA. \n \n5  ADB.  2018.  https://www.adb.org/documents/strategy-2030-prosperous-inclusive-resilient-sustainable-asia-pacific. \nManila. The five areas of focus under Strategy 2030 include: women\u2019s economic empowerment, gender equality in \nhuman development, gender equality in decision-making and leadership, reduced time poverty of women, and \nwomen\u2019s resilience to external shocks.  Operational Priority 2 identifies approaches to achieve Strategy 2030 gender \ntargets. The SDG 5 Transformative Gender Agenda include: violence against women, unpaid care and domestic \nwork, voice and leadership, sexual and reproductive rights, economic assets, ICT, legal/institutional reforms for \nnorms change.  \n6  ADB\u2019s gender corporate target is that 55% of its projects should meet requirements for GEN or EGM categorization \nby 2030, as per ADB\u2019s 4-tier gender classification system at-entry. Category 1 or gender equity (GEN) projects have \ndirect gender benefits at the outcome level; category 2 or effective gender mainstreaming (EGM) projects have \nmajority of their outputs incorporated with proactive gender design elements; category 3 or some gender elements \n(SGE) projects have only a sprinkling of proactive gender elements; and category 4 or no gender elements (NGE) \nprojects do not have proactive gender elements. Only categories 1 (GEN) and 2 (EGM) contribute to meeting the \n55% gender target. Gender target at-exit is 80% of GEN/EGM projects should be rated \u201csuccessful in GAP \nimplementation\u201d. \n7  ADB. 2019. https://www.adb.org/documents/adb-results-framework-2019-2024-policy-paper. Manila.  \n    \n \n ", "3 \n \nC.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n6.  Overall outcome. The transaction TA cluster will have the following overall outcome:  \nGender mainstreaming in CWA operations expanded and improved.  Each transaction TA cluster \nsubproject will deliver on the output to which it is aligned and this will be specified in each \ntransaction TA subproject proposal. \n \n7.  Output  1:  Gender-inclusive  components  in  sovereign  projects  and  programs \nincorporated. Projects that do not easily lend themselves to gender mainstreaming require \nadditional support to incorporate measures that will address gender gaps or promote gender \ninclusion.  Selected  components  of  upcoming  infrastructure  projects  will  model  women\u2019s \nempowerment measures such as livelihood and entrepreneurship support, or financial literacy \nand investment trainings, or technical trainings to increase the number of women in science, \ntechnology, and engineering courses and improve women\u2019s participation in infrastructure sectors, \nor  financial  inclusion  measures  for  unbanked  women  and  vulnerable  sectors.  Specifically, \ntransactional TA subprojects 4, 5, 6, 8,10, 11, and 12 will provide capacity building support that \nwill enable the ensuing projects to deliver their gender-related outputs. Subprojects 7 and 9 will \nprovide capacity building support and policy advice on gender-responsive budgeting and inclusive \nfinancial inclusion to an ongoing8 and an ensuing project. Ensuing projects and programs with \ngender-inclusive  components  supported  by  the  transaction  TA  will  have  at  least  an  EGM \ncategorization at-entry.  \n \n8.   Output 2: DMC capacity for GAP implementation and monitoring of gender equality \nresults enhanced. The quality of gender mainstreaming of ongoing sovereign projects with GAPs, \nand in sovereign programs with gender targets, will be improved. Ongoing projects and programs \nthat have gender actions and targets in their design and monitoring frameworks (DMFs), or GAPs, \nor  policy matrices  need  to  be  carefully monitored to  ensure  quality  implementation.   Past \nexperiences show that not all gender actions that have been implemented would result in the \nenvisaged targets, and thus, do not help make the project \u201csuccessful\u201d at-exit. To systematize the \nmonitoring of gender equality results, the development and maintenance of the Gender Database \nis included in this output. The database will track implementation of GAP activities and assess \nthe  progress  towards achieving GAP  targets. Remedial  actions  can  be  taken  on  problem \nareas identified early enough and mitigate the risk of non-achievement of GAP targets. Close \nmonitoring of GAP implementation also helps identify capacity building needs of EAs/IAs to better \nimplement project GAPs. While project implementing units would usually have gender consultants \nto implement GAPs, there is still the need for ADB to monitor and provide technical gender \nguidance to ensure the quality achievement of GAP targets, ensure a \u2018successful\u2019 gender rating \nat-exit, and meet the Department\u2019s overall gender targets at-exit. International and national \ngender consultants will be recruited in headquarters (HQ) and resident missions (RMs) to support \nthe implementation, monitoring and reporting of gender actions of projects and programs in their \nspecific countries of assignment.  (The list of ongoing projects with gender actions and targets \nthat will be monitored is in Appendix 3.) Gender capacity building of partner sector agencies and \nnational women\u2019s ministries and agencies will be conducted at the national and subregional levels.  \n \nD.  Cost and Indicative Financing \n \n9.  The transaction TA cluster is estimated to cost $3.0 million which will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6 and TASF-other sources).

The list of indicative TA subprojects and their indicative budgets is provided in Table 2. \nDetailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each TA subproject \nproposal submitted for approval. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB will be the executing agency and will administer the transaction TA cluster. CWRD\u2019s \nPortfolio,  Results,  Safeguards  and  Gender  Unit  (CWOD-PSG)  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the transaction TA cluster, in close coordination with the sector divisions involved \nin the processing and implementation of specific subprojects. Each transaction TA subproject \nproposal will be submitted for approval to the CWRD Director General in accordance with the \nbusiness process for transaction TA cluster processing. Subproject activities attached to loans \nwill  start  only  after  loan  effectiveness.  CWOD-PSG  will  conduct  an  annual  review  of  the \nimplementation progress of the transaction TA. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  April 2020 \u2013 December 2022 \nimplementation period \nfor the transaction TA \ncluster \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nCWRD, CWOD-PSG \nConsultants  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by \n  Individual: Gender  ICS  ADB \nMonitoring Experts \nSubproject 1 (6 individual \nconsultants) \n  Individual: Gender  ICS  ADB \nMonitoring Experts \nSubproject 2 (6 individual \nconsultants) \n  Firm: Gender Database  CQS  ADB \nDevelopment  \nSubproject 2  \n  Individual: Gender  ICS  ADB \nMonitoring Experts \nSubproject 3 (6 individual \nconsultants) \n  Firm:  Women in Energy   CQS  ADB \nTraining Package \n(Subproject 4) \n  Firm:  Putting Women on  FBS  ADB \nthe Right Track in the \nRailway Sector \nSubproject 5) \n  Firm: Women in Border  CQS  ADB \nCommunities Support \nPackage (Subproject 6) \n \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \n  Individual: Gender  ICS  ADB \nBudgeting Expert \n(Subproject 7) \n  Firm: Women in  CQS  ADB \nTransport Training \nPackage (Subproject 8) \n  Individual: Gender and  ICS  ADB \nFinance Expert \n(Subproject 9) \n  Firm: Training Package  CQS  ADB \nfor Women \nEntrepreneurs \n(Subproject 10) \n  Firm: Training Package  CQS  ADB \nfor Energy-Based \nLivelihoods for Women \n(Subproject 11) \n  Firm Building Capacities  CQS  ADB \nof Women in Renewable \nEnergy (Subproject 12)  \nAdvance contracting and  Use of advance contracting or retroactive financing will be specified in each subproject \nretroactive financing  proposal \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nUse of advance payment facility or reimbursement will be assessed and specified in \neach subproject proposal. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualification selection, CWOD = Office of the Director General, \nCWRD = Central and West Asia Department, FBS = fixed budget selection, ICS = individual consultant selection, PSG \n= Portfolio, Results, Safeguards and Gender Unit, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n11.
