INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)1 strategic framework 2002\u20132012 identifies five \nstrategic thrusts to realize the vision and goals of subregional cooperation and integration. One of \nthese includes developing human resources and skills competencies. The midterm review of the \nGMS strategic framework2 concluded that while good progress had been made on the \u201chardware\u201d \naspects of subregional cooperation, especially improved physical connectivity, less progress had \nbeen  made  on  the  \u201csoftware\u201d  aspects  to  realize  and  achieve  the  overall  vision,  goals,  and \nobjectives of the GMS program. The review recommended more emphasis on skills development, \nlabor migration, prevention of trafficking of women and children, and surveillance and control of \ncommunicable diseases. It suggested modifying the structure and organization of the human \nresource development (HRD) working group to strengthen and revitalize it so as to focus on \ncritical subregional HRD concerns requiring subregional solutions.  \n \n2.  The proposed regional policy and advisory technical assistance (TA)3 supports the GMS \nstrategic framework and is included in the Regional Cooperation Business Plan 2009\u20132011. It is \nconsistent  with  the  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)4 and supports two core operational areas: regional operation and \nintegration, and education. The TA will implement some of the recommendations of the GMS \nmidterm  review  and  the  2008  regional  cooperation  assistance  program  evaluation  by \nstrengthening  the  working  group  on  HRD  (WGHRD),  restructuring  the  organizational \narrangements, building capacity, and implementing some of the priority initiatives from the GMS \nHRD Strategic Framework and Action Plan (SFAP). The proposed SFAP provides the framework \nfor subregional cooperation in education, health, labor and migration, and social development that \nrequires  subregional  actions  and  solutions.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  improved  subregional \ncooperation in HRD through (i) support for an improved system for technical skills recognition and \nqualifications, (ii) strengthened regional labor market information system and labor migration \nmanagement programs, and (iii) assessment of the impact of economic corridors on ethnic and \nvulnerable groups. The TA design and monitoring framework identifying the impact, outcome, \noutputs, and activities is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The GMS is developing rapidly in the context of an emerging subregional economy as a \nresult of increased physical and economic connectivity. A number of HRD issues, several of \nwhich are interlinked, have emerged as a result of improved road links, rapid economic growth, \nlabor mobility, and uneven economic development. These include (i) lack of compatibility between \nthe subregion's education systems; (ii) inadequacies in labor migration policies and management \nsystems; (iii) the spread of communicable diseases, including HIV;5 (iv) increasing potential for \nhuman trafficking; (v) disproportionate impact of these issues on vulnerable groups such as \nwomen and ethnic minority communities; and (vi) inadequate national capacity to effectively \nmanage the social impacts of accelerating regional integration. While the current financial crisis is \nexpected to slow economic growth in the subregion, these HRD challenges will remain and need \nto be addressed both in the short-term and for the GMS countries to retain their competitive edge \nwhen the economies recover in the medium term.  \n                                                 \n1  The Greater Mekong Subregion countries are Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic  of China, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n2  ADB. 2007. Midterm Review of the Greater Mekong Subregion Strategic Framework (2002\u20132012). Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 March 2009. \n4  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n5  Health is an important subregional HRD challenge and links to other HRD issues, but is covered under other ADB \nGMS projects.  \n ", "2   \n \n4.  Stronger  subregional  economic  links  are  generating  new  skills  requirements  and \nemployment opportunities within each country and across the subregion. To satisfy projected \nemployment  demands  needed  to  sustain  and  promote  economic  growth  and  contribute  to \nregional integration, significant improvement is required in the education and skill levels of the \nGMS workforce. National education and skills development systems need to be upgraded and \nmade compatible so that the skills and qualifications of graduates are mutually recognized across \nthe subregion. Higher education institutions need to be linked for better cooperation on standard \nsetting and quality assurance mechanisms. Improved subregional cooperation is required to \nreach agreement in these areas. Further, technical and vocational education and training systems \nneed to be better aligned with regional skill demands and requirements.  \n \n5.  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  studies  report  that  several  Southeast  Asian \ncountries (including Thailand) suffer from a chronic shortage of qualified workers, indicating a \nmismatch between the supply and demand of workers with appropriate education and skills. The \ngap  has  widened  with  the  region's  accelerated  economic  growth,  and  potentially  poses  a \nconstraint to continued growth. Countries need to build strong and responsive higher education \nand technical and vocational education and training systems that are regionally compatible, with \nqualifications and skills mutually recognized. To sustain economic growth, the subregion requires \na workforce with the right mix of knowledge and skills which can move freely between the \ncountries to meet projected labor demands and simultaneously provide improved employment \nopportunities. Migrant workers are a key source of skilled and unskilled workers. \n \n6.  More  than  2  million  migrant  workers  are  estimated  to  have  moved  between  GMS \ncountries in the last few years for economic reasons.6 The stock of GMS labor migrants is \nestimated at 4.1 million and is projected to increase to 5 million during the next 10 years.7 This \ntrend is driven by factors such as uneven development patterns, slowing labor force growth in \nThailand, and improved physical connectivity. Thailand is the major GMS receiving country, with \nthe largest number of migrants from Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and \nMyanmar. Thailand is estimated to have 2.6 million irregular and legal migrants living in the \ncountry, not including several hundred thousand daily migrants in border areas. It has been \nestimated that migrant workers contribute 1.25%\u20136.20% of Thailand\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP),8 with benefits also flowing to sending countries in the form of remittances. According to \none ILO study, annual remittances from Cambodian labor migrants are equal to 4.1% of GDP.9 \nADB's  study  of  the  labor  market  in  Asia  states  that  \u201cIncreasingly,  Asia's  high-performing \neconomies are drawing on migrants to meet demands along the whole spectrum of skills.\u201d10 A \nrecent study concluded that the current economic downturn will have only minor impacts on \nmigration stocks but is likely to have large short-term effects on migration flows (footnote 6).  \n \n7.  While there has been considerable interest in mutual recognition of technical skills and \nqualifications there has been little progress, in part due to the lack of well-functioning national \nsystems (except in Thailand). Subregional cooperation is required to support the development of \npractical systems for comparing and recognizing technical skills and qualifications. A framework \nfor the mutual recognition of technical skills and qualifications is required within the GMS. This \nwould help to address the subregional skills shortages and enhance subregional competitiveness.  \n \n                                                 \n6  World Bank. 2006.

High-quality labor market information is essential to support informed decision making by \npolicy makers, employers, workers, job seekers, and training providers. Quality labor market \ninformation helps to better manage the demand for labor and design appropriate employment and \ntraining  programs.  With  increased  economic  integration  of  the  GMS,  it  is  important  that \ncomparable regional labor market information, based on an agreed set of indicators, is shared to \nfacilitate  better  understanding  of  the  regional  trends  and  workforce  supply  and  demand. \nSubstantial work is required at the national level to develop labor market information systems that \nare compatible regionally and help to monitor regional labor market trends.  \n \n9.  The new transport corridors and emerging economic hubs are transforming many parts of \nthe  subregion,  providing  improved  access  to  income-generating  opportunities,  markets,  and \nsocial services such as education and health. However, these positive benefits can sometimes be \nundermined by negative impacts of improved physical connectivity and integration. Further, the \ncurrent financial crisis may also result in increased poverty and deprivation. As noted in the GMS \nmidterm review, \"further measures are required to minimize and mitigate the adverse impact of \nrapid  economic  development\"  and  to  manage  the  social  changes  taking  place,  especially \namongst remote communities. Improved regional road networks are leading to increased mobility \nand  migration  resulting  in  the  spread  of  communicable  diseases,  including  HIV,  and  the \nemergence of new types of social relationships that can sometimes be exploitative. The negative \neffects of improved physical connectivity, large infrastructure projects, and regional integration\u2014\nsuch as trafficking of women, emergence of a commercial sex trade, and social and economic \ndisruption and displacement\u2014need to be mitigated and managed. Effective mitigation activities \nrequire understanding of the nature of social changes in the context of economic integration. \nSocial impact assessments along the transport corridors and economic hubs are needed to better \ncomprehend the economic, social, and cultural impacts of subregional integration on vulnerable \ngroups  such  as  women  and  ethnic  minorities.  These  assessments  can  then  lead  to  the \ndevelopment and implementation of more effective prevention and mitigation programs. \n \n10.  Given  the  multifaceted  nature  of  HRD  cooperation  in  the  GMS,  the  WGHRD  needs \nrestructuring and strengthening in order to fulfill its dual mandate of supporting the HRD needs of \nthe  subregion  while  simultaneously  mitigating  the  potential  negative  effects  of  increased \nconnectivity and regional integration. This dual mandate, combined with the multisector make-up \nof  the  WGHRD,  requires  the  active  involvement  and  cooperation  of  different  ministries  and \nagencies both within and between countries. Unfortunately there has been limited interagency or \nsubregional cooperation on subregional HRD issues. The lack of continuity of participants at the \nWGHRD meetings reflects its low priority. However, GMS countries have stated the importance of \nsubregional HRD and have called for this working group to be more effective. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA is strengthened human resource development and enhanced social \ninclusion in the GMS. The outcome is improved HRD cooperation in the GMS. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will support the implementation of the HRD SFAP by restructuring the WGHRD \nand  its  subgroups,  building  capacity  of  the  WGHRD  members  and  relevant  agencies,  and \nimplementing some of the priority initiatives of the SFAP to improve regional HRD cooperation. \nThe following four specific outputs will be supported. \n \n ", "4   \n1.  Strengthened Subregional Institutional Arrangements for Human Resource \nDevelopment Cooperation \n13.  Given the multisector nature of the WGHRD, the TA will support separate meetings of the \nfour sector subgroups (education, health, labor and migration, and social development) both \nnationally and subregionally to implement their respective work plans. More regular meetings, \ndiverse communication approaches, and networking will facilitate continuity of membership and \ngreater ownership of the GMS HRD agenda. At the country level subgroups will be encouraged to \nwork together to address issues of common interest. Similarly, at the subregional level, the sector \ngroups will be supported to meet on a more regular basis to further develop subregional actions. \nThe umbrella HRD working group will meet every two years to review strategic issues, such as \nthe strategy to sustain HRD cooperation, and review the progress and next steps in the priority \nactions. Appendix 4 provides an explanation of the institutional arrangements. The TA will also \nprovide support for addressing HRD issues in the programs of other GMS sector working groups. \n \n2.  Agreed  Framework  for  Mutual  Recognition  of  Technical  Skills  and \nQualifications \n14.  The TA will contribute to the development and piloting of a subregional technical skills and \nqualifications recognition framework. This activity will identify, develop, and pilot the regional \ncertification of three technical skill areas. The criteria for identifying the three pilot skill areas \ninclude (i) economic importance, (ii) cross-border industry demand, (iii) employment of large \nnumbers of migrant workers, and (iv) being at a relevant stage of the development of national \nstandards for that skill area. Recognition by the participating GMS countries of the competency-\nbased skill certificates for three technical skill areas will be supported under the TA. A desk study \nwill assess and review the current status of skills recognition arrangements or proposals. A GMS \ntechnical skills recognition framework for the three pilots will be developed for discussion and \nendorsement by the relevant government ministries. \n \n3.  Improved  Labor  Market  Information  System  and  Labor  Migration \nManagement Programs \n15.  The TA will support the development and adoption of a common set of indicators for \nmonitoring labor market trends across the subregion. The indicator set will include both supply \nand demand data of key skill areas to enable better labor force projections and management, \nincluding labor migration. It will also support the endorsement of a methodology to collect, collate, \nshare, and manage this indicator set. An analysis of the current labor market information sharing \nsystem will be prepared as a basis for GMS country discussions. The TA will also support \nactivities to (i) improve labor migration management; (ii) develop and conduct an information \ncampaign  for  potential  migrant  workers  in  at  least  two  sending  countries,  focusing  on  the \nmigration process, potential problems, rights, and general information on labor demand; and (iii) \ndevelop a draft standard employment contract for technical migrant workers for consideration by \nthe GMS countries. \n \n4.  Completed Social Impact Assessments along the Greater Mekong Subregion \nEconomic Corridors \n16.  Social impact assessments will be conducted in selected areas along the transport and \neconomic  corridors  to  better  understand  the  impacts  of  increased  physical  and  economic \nintegration on vulnerable groups such as women and ethnic minority communities. Further social \nimpact assessment of the financial crisis on poor people and marginalized groups will also be \nconducted. The findings will be used to guide future initiatives to promote social inclusion and to \nmitigate potential negative impacts. Lessons learned will be applied in the design of future GMS \nprojects across the different sectors. A desk study of the findings and lessons from previous ADB \n ", "  5\nsocial impact assessments and the results of other relevant studies will be undertaken, and this \nwill be used as input into assessing the design of, and identifying the locations for assessments.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is $1.4 million, of which (i) $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility; (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund, administered by \nADB; and (iii) $150,000 will be in-kind government contributions. Detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will commence on 1 May 2009 with a completion date of 31 October 2011, i.e., 2.5 \nyears.  The  executing  agency  will  be  ADB  with  the  respective  ADB  subgroup  focal  points \ncoordinating  the  subgroups  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  specific  outputs.  The \nimplementing agencies will be government ministries responsible for education, employment, \nlabor, migration, and ethnic minorities. The subsector focal point in each GMS country will be the \ncontact point for their subgroup. Consultations will occur with civil society for outputs 2, 3, and 4, \nand with the private sector for outputs 2 and 3. Reports will be made to the GMS Senior Officials' \nmeeting and the WGHRD and subgroup meetings, and on the GMS website. A no-objection letter \nwill be obtained before the start of TA activities in the territory of the participating countries. \n \n19.  In output 1, the ADB WGHRD focal point will manage individual national consultants. For \noutput 2, a firm will be engaged to develop and pilot the framework for mutual technical skills \nrecognition using quality and cost-based selection and a performance-based contract. In output 3, \nthe labor migration awareness campaign is politically and socially sensitive work and the single-\nsource selection with a lump sum contract of the International Organization for Migration is \njustified on the basis that it has the experience and respect of both governments and civil society. \nIndividual international consultants will be engaged for the labor market information system work. \nFor output 4, ADB will engage individual international consultants to undertake the social impact \nassessments. In addition to the two firms, a total of 9.5 person-months of individual international \nconsulting services and 55 person-months of individual national consulting services is required. \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consulting service expertise required \nincludes  technical  skills  recognition  systems,  labor  migration  management,  labor  market \ninformation, regional cooperation and development, gender, social development, and project \nsupport. The terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The disbursement under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.11  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People's Republic of China Poverty and Regional Cooperation Fund, and (ii) \nthe provision of balance of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a \ngrant basis  for Implementing the Greater Mekong Subregion Human Resource Development \nStrategy Framework and Action Plan, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2008.
