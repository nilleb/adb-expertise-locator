Technical  Assistance  (TA)  3944-PAK: \nIndustrial Environmental Management1 for $700,000 was approved in July 2002.  ADB obtained \nco-financing of $1.0 million for Industrial Environmental Management Capacity Building from the \nNorwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  (NORAD).      A  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission2 \nvisited  Pakistan  during  13-17  April  2003  to  formulate  the  proposed  TA  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objective, scope, implementation arrangements, cost \nestimates, and terms of reference of consultants3.   The TA is included in the 2003 Country \nStrategy and Program Update. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The establishment of environmental policies and regulations in Pakistan began in 1975 \nwhen the Environment and Urban Affairs Division (EUAD) was established in the Ministry of \nHousing  and  Works.  EUAD  was  instrumental  in  promulgating  the  landmark  Pakistan \nEnvironmental Protection Ordinance of 1983, which provided a legal framework for national \nenvironmental management and established the national environmental quality standards that \nset limits for emissions and discharges.  The Ordinance also called for the establishment of the \nPakistan  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (Pak-EPA)  and  four  provincial  environmental \nprotection agencies (provincial EPAs).  In 1994, the Government upgraded EUAD to the full-\nfledged Ministry of Environment and Urban Affairs, headed by a minister.  In November 1996, it \nwas redesignated as the Ministry of Environment, Local Government, and Rural Development \n(MELG&RD). The main function of MELG&RD is to ensure that environmental considerations \nand concerns of sustainable development are incorporated into national development plans and \npolicies.  The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (PEPA) was passed by Parliament on 11 \nSeptember 1997.  The Act empowers Pak-EPA to handle pollution-related problems as well as \nhazardous and toxic waste, and charges it and the provincial EPAs with implementing PEPA.  \nPak-EPA  is  a  department  of  MELG&RD.    The  federal  and  provincial  EPAs  have  similar \norganization structure.  A director general heads Pak-EPA and each provincial EPA and is \nassisted by directors, deputy directors, or assistant directors responsible for specific areas of \nenvironmental management.   \n \n3.  The Government recognizes that promoting industrial environmental management is \nalso  an  opportunity  to  improve  industrial  production  efficiency  through  cleaner  production.  \nCleaner production occurs when raw materials, water, energy, and other resources are utilized \nmore efficiently, when less harmful substances are substituted for hazardous ones, and when \ntoxic substances are eliminated from the production process. The result is less waste (or \npollution)  at  the  end  of  the  production  process.    Through  this  approach,  environmental \nmanagement does not have to be an added expense to the production process, but rather an \nopportunity to lower the per-unit cost of production.  Industrial environmental management is \nespecially critical because, beginning on 1 January 2005, the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nwill  require  all  countries  exporting  to  WTO\u2019s  member  countries  to  meet  environmental \nguidelines.  Although this requirement will affect only the first-tier exporter in 2005, second- and \nthird-tier4 suppliers will also be required to meet the WTO environmental requirements soon \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Industrial Environmental Management. \nManila. \n2 The Mission was carried out by S. Tumiwa, renewable energy specialist, SAEN.  \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2003. \n4 Second- and third-tier exporters refer to the suppliers and subcontractors of the exporters. ", "2 \nafter.  This has served as a strong driver for export-oriented industries and their suppliers to \nimprove their environmental performance. \n \n4.  Other funding agencies have also been active in promoting industrial efficiency and \nenvironmental  management.    Currently,  both  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) have ongoing \nprojects in this sector.  NORAD recently completed a project targeting waste reduction in the \ntanneries  sector  while  the  Netherlands  has  also  financed  a  project  to  promote  cleaner \nproduction in targeted industry sectors.  The International Union for Conservation of Nature and \nNatural Resources (IUCN) is implementing the Pakistan Environmental Program to strengthen \nthe role of environmental nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  The Federation of Pakistan \nChambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has an active program promoting improved \nindustrial  environmental  management  among  the  members.    These  organizations  strongly \nwelcome ADB\u2019s timely assistance to the Government and support the undertaking of the TA.  \nThe TA is in line with ADB's Country Strategy and Program for Pakistan, which seeks to support \nsustainable growth and the private sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The TA will help the  Government promote industrial environmental management to \nimprove industrial efficiency and competitiveness.  The objective will be achieved through the \nfollowing ways:  (i) strengthen the institutional capacity and technical capability of Pak-EPA, \nprovincial EPAs, and local governments and other organizations involved in promoting industrial \nenvironmental efficiency; (ii) develop environmental action plans for industries to establish a \nbaseline  of  their  current  environmental  performance  and  set  benchmarks  for  future \nperformance; (iii) train financial institutions to appraise investments for cleaner production and \nenvironmental management; and (iv) draft regulations and guidelines for implementing new \nmarket-based incentives and policies for industrial environmental management.  The TA is \nexpected  to  strengthen  the  capability  of  Pak-EPA,  the  provincial  EPAs  and  relevant  local \ngovernment agencies to develop and implement systems to improve and monitor industrial \nenvironmental management, and to improve the environmental performance of industries.  The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The  TA  will  cover  the  four  provinces.    The  underlying  methodology  is  to  transfer \ninternational best practices on industrial efficiency and environmental management to Pakistan \nand build the capacity of government agencies as well as industry associations to serve as \nextension systems to promote adoption of best practices by industrial units.  The experience of \nindustrial environmental management in Pakistan is that new initiatives started by aid agencies \nare forced to end when funding runs out.  To ensure the sustainability of this capacity building \nproject,  the  TA  will  focus  on  adding  value  to  ongoing  Government  initiatives  by  providing \ncatalytic interventions to build and strengthen these initiatives and ensure their effectiveness.  It \nis recognized that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the most difficult segment of \nindustry to regulate and to prod improve their environmental performance. They are also the \ngreatest polluters.  Therefore, the TA will emphasize this segment of industry.  The following are \nkey activities of the TA. \n ", "    3 \n1.  Strengthen Capacity and Technical Capability of Pak-EPA, Provincial EPAs, \nand Industry \n \n7.  This component will have three parts: \n \na.  Support the National Environmental Action Plan \n \n8.  The Government has started a national environmental action plan (NEAP) that will take \nimmediate steps to achieve a visible improvement in the rapidly deteriorating environment \nthrough effective cooperation between government agencies and civil society. The NEAP, which \nwill be implemented by MELG&RD will address four core areas:  (i) clean air, (ii) clean water, \n(iii)  solid  waste  management,  and  (iv)  ecosystem  management.    The  NEAP  has  six \nsubprograms:  (i) policy coordination, (ii) pollution control, (iii) ecosystem management and \nnatural  resource  conservation,  (iv)  energy  conservation  and  renewables,  (v)  dry  land \nmanagement and water conservation, and (vi) support for grassroots initiatives.  The proposed \nTA specifically supports the pollution control subprogram. \n \n9.  The TA will help Pak-EPA and the provincial EPAs identify 6-8 priority industry sectors \n(e.g.,  tanneries,  textiles,  food  processing,  chemicals,  metal  finishing/fabrication,  cement, \niron/steel, etc.) and help industry develop sector-specific environmental action plans (EAPs) for \nimproving  industrial  environmental  management.    In  developing  the  EAPs,  Pak-EPA  and \nprovincial EPAs will work with industry associations and NGOs to ensure strong stakeholder \nparticipation and ownership.  This effort will comprise three parts and will involve the following.  \n(i) Review the needs assessment carried out by the Industrial Environmental Management TA to \nunderstand the needs of Pak-EPA and the provincial EPAs.  When the review is completed, the \nTA consultants will develop a detailed work plan for capacity building. (ii) Develop a sequenced \ntraining program for Pak-EPA,the provincial EPAs, other concerned government agencies and \nindustry. To be implemented over 2 years, the program will include introductory as well as \nadvanced training in designing approaches for promoting environmental management systems \n(EMS),  designing  initiatives,  technical  issues  concerning  EMS,  cleaner  production,  market-\nbased incentives, working with stakeholders, etc. (iii) Train Pak-EPA and provincial EPA staff to \nhelp industry associations develop and implement sector-specific Environmental Action Plan \n(EAPs). \n \n10.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  capability  of  Pak-EPA,  the  provincial  EPAs,  and  local \ngovernments to develop, monitor, and implement sector-specific EAPs and 5-7 sectors specific \nEAPs that will serve as a basis for improving the environmental performance of industries.  The \nGovernment also envisions developing a program under which these EAPs will serve as a \ncontract between industry and the Government to improve the environmental performance of \nindustry over time. \n \nb.  Institutionalize the Self-Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) and the \nEnvironmental Management Information System (EMIS) \n \n11.  Pak-EPA, in consultation with industry, has developed a modeling system that industry \ncan use to monitor its environmental performance.  In collaboration with the provincial EPAs and \nthe FPCCI \u2014 the apex industry association representing sector-specific industry associations \u2014 \nPak-EPA has piloted SMART with 50 industry units.  As a result of the pilot, Pak-EPA has \nreceived  applications  from  almost  300  additional  units  to  implement  SMART.  The  TA  will \nstrengthen SMART by providing technical assistance and training to Pak-EPA, the provincial \nEPAs, concerned local government agencies, FPCCI, and participating industry associations to ", "4 \nlaunch and implement SMART throughout Pakistan.  In addition, Pak-EPA has developed EMIS \nas a database of success stories and best practices on environmental management in Pakistan.  \nThe TA will help further populate the database with success stories and provide access to \nindustry associations and industrial units via the internet.  The SMART modeling system will \nalso feed into the EMIS database so that Pak-EPA and the provincial EPAs can record and \nmonitor the performance of the industrial units. \n \nc.  Increase  Understanding  of  the  Value  of  Improved  Environmental \nManagement \n \n12.  Tied to both parts will be awareness-raising activities for both industry and communities \naround the selected industries to help them understand the value of improved environmental \nmanagement and play their respective roles in ensuring such improvement.  Much of this \nprogram will be based on promoting global best practices in corporate social responsibility and \nthe interrelationship of the roles of industry, the government, and communities.  Part of this \nawareness-raising program will be to socially market SMART to industry as well as the public at \nlarge.  The recognition program will designate participating firms as \u201cSMART companies\u201d and \nwill afford them recognition as socially responsible companies.  \n \n2.  Assist  Financial  Institutions  in  Appraising  Loans  For  Cleaner  Production  and \nEnvironmental Management \n \n13.  Financial institutions have currently little or no capacity to understand, let alone appraise, \nloans for cleaner production and environmental management investments.  The TA will train \nappropriate  personnel  in  selected  financial  institutions  to  appraise  cleaner  production  and \nenvironmental management investments.  Special attention will be paid to financial institutions \nthat are working with SMEs or have lines of credit from ADB to provide financing to SMEs. In \naddition, the TA will also train the Central Board of Revenue5 to build its understanding of and \ncapacity for cleaner production and environmental management. \n \n3.  Assist Pak-EPA in Formulating Policies and Regulations \n \n14.  One  component  of  the  Industrial  Environmental  Management  TA6  will  formulate  a \nprogram of policy reform for industrial efficiency and environmental management and outline a \npolicy framework matrix and action plan that will be implemented by the Government.  The TA \nwill  help  Pak-EPA  draft  the  regulations  and  guidelines  for  implementing  the  policies \nrecommended under TA  3944. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $1.25 million equivalent, comprising \nabout $500,000 in foreign exchange and about $750,000 equivalent in local currency. The cost \nestimates are presented in Appendix 2.  ADB will provide $1.00 million, comprising $500,000 in \nforeign exchange and $500,000 equivalent of local currency.  The TA will be financed on a grant \n                                                 \n5 The Central Board of Revenue (CBR) is an important stakeholder because many policy recommendations that will \ncome from the Industrial Environmental Management TA will be market-based incentives that involve tax policies.  As \nsuch, CBR\u2019s understanding of cleaner production and environmental management will be critical for policy changes in \nthis area. \n6 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Industrial Environmental Management. \nManila. ", "    5 \nbasis by the NORAD cofinancing facility and will be administered by ADB.  The Government will \nfinance the remaining $250,000 equivalent of the local currency costs in kind.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will use the project management unit (PMU) and steering committee, - with \ncorresponding responsibilities, - that were formed for TA 3944.  Under the arrangements, Pak-\nEPA will be the Executing Agency.  A PMU within Pak-EPA, headed by the director general, will \nbe the focal point of the TA and will be responsible for daily supervision of the consulting team.  \nThe  consultants  and  the  PMU  will  hold  biweekly  progress  review  meetings  to  ensure \ncoordination and smooth project implementation. \n \n17.  Local government entities will be included in the TA as the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts \nat decentralization have the local government entities playing an ever increasing and critical role \nin industrial environmental management. \n \n18.  A high-level steering committee will be constituted to optimize effective participation, \ncoordination, and implementation of the TA among the relevant federal, provincial, and local \nagencies, FPCCI, and other stakeholders. In recognition of the important role of FPCCI in this \nTA, FPCCI may organize working groups within its own structure that will include the relevant \nindustry  subsectors.    The  secretary  of  MELG&RD  will  be  the  chairperson  of  the  steering \ncommittee.  The steering committee will be responsible for inter-agency coordination, provide \nthe strategic direction for the proposed TA, review and approve the draft reports of the TA.   \n \n19.  The TA will start in February 2004 with completion by February 2006. It will be carried \nout over 24 months by international consulting firms/institutes in association with domestic \nconsultants. The total input of international and domestic consulting services will be about 24 \nand 60 person-months, respectively. The consultants will have demonstrated experience in \nindustrial environmental capacity building. The outline terms of reference for consulting services \nare in Appendix 3.  ADB will use simplified technical proposals and quality- and cost-based \nselection methods for selecting the consultants.  Consultants will be selected in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Pakistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Norway for \nIndustrial Environmental Management Capacity Building, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n ", "6
