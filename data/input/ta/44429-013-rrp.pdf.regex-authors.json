THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Climate Adaptation in Vennar Subbasin in Cauvery Delta Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will mitigate the impacts of climate change by reducing flood risks \nand improving the distribution of water for irrigation in an increasingly water-stressed area. This \nwill be achieved through investments in infrastructure and improved water management in six \nchannels,2 covering a total command area of 78,000 hectares (ha), in the Vennar system of the \nCauvery delta in Tamil Nadu.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Tamil  Nadu  is  one  of  the  most  water-stressed  states  in  India,  with  a  per  capita \navailability of water resources of 900 cubic meters per year (m3/year) compared with a national \naverage of 1,545 m3/year and a water stress threshold of 1,700 m3/year.4 The mean annual \nrainfall is 912 millimeters, of which 48% comes from the erratic northeast monsoon (October to \nDecember) and 32% from the southwest monsoon (June to September). Of the 17 major river \nbasins in Tamil Nadu, the Cauvery Basin is the largest. The Cauvery River flows through the \nstates of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and the Karaikal enclave of the Union Territory of \nPuducherry. Around 54% of its catchment area lies within Tamil Nadu. \n \n4.  The Cauvery delta lies on the east coast of Tamil Nadu and is referred to as the \u201crice \nbowl of Tamil Nadu.\u201d About 73% of the delta\u2019s population of 4.8 million is engaged in farming \nand fishing, and is dependent on water resources for their livelihoods. However, the availability \nof water resources in the delta is unreliable and flooding is common during the erratic northeast \nmonsoon. District Revenue Department records estimate damage caused by floods in 2004\u2013\n2013 at $70.4 million. Meanwhile, climate change projections indicate an intensification of floods \nas rainfall increases during the monsoon and sea levels rise. Storm rainfall is predicted to \nincrease by 19%. In coastal areas, flooding will increase because sea levels are projected to \nrise from 0.29 meters (low scenario) to 0.87 meters (high scenario) by 2100, compared with a \n1990 baseline.5 Rising temperatures will increase crop water demand and evaporative losses. \nBy 2050, maximum temperatures will rise by 1.0\u00b0C\u20131.5\u00b0C, according to climate projections, and \nminimum temperatures will increase by a larger 2.0\u00b0C\u20133.0\u00b0C.6 The climate models demonstrate \ndrier conditions from January to May. \n \n5.  The sharing of Cauvery waters among the states has been disputed since the 1890s, \nand in February 2013, the Supreme Court of India upheld the water allocation decision that the \nCauvery Waters Dispute Tribunal had made in 2007. Tamil Nadu was allocated 58% of the \nsurface water resources of the basin. Despite high levels of water stress, recurrent flooding, and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  These are the Valavanar drain and Vedharanyam canal, which convey flood and drainage flows, and the \nPandavaiyar, Vellaiyar, Harichandranadhi, and Addapar channels, which serve as irrigation and drainage channels. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Climate Adaptation \nthrough the Subbasin Development Investment Program (TA 8166-IND). \n4  Government of India, Press Information Bureau 2012. Per Capita Water Availability. News release. 26 April. \nhttp://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=82676 \n5  ADB. 2014. Relative Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the Cauvery Delta Zone in Tamil Nadu, India. Consultant\u2019s \nreport. Manila (TA 8166-IND). \n6  ADB. 2013. Climate Data and Future Scenarios. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 8166-IND). ", "2 \nincreasing risks of climate change, the long-standing dispute prevented investments toward \nimproving  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  in  the  delta  beyond  essential  maintenance. \nTherefore, the irrigation and drainage systems are dilapidated and unable to effectively convey \nirrigation and floodwaters. This led to inequitable distribution of irrigation water, with upstream \nfarmers benefiting, and increased flooding due to overtopping or breaching of embankments. \nSome of the tail-end areas no longer have access to irrigation water. Malfunctioning tail-end \nregulators  led to  seawater  ingress  along  channels. In the  lower  reaches  of the  delta,  the \navailability of fresh groundwater is limited as a result of variable recharge and saline aquifers. \nCommunities along the lower coastal reaches of the delta are particularly disadvantaged since \nthey have access to neither fresh groundwater nor fresh surface water. This negatively affects \nthe agricultural production in the area. In 2012, because of a poor southwest monsoon, the \npaddy  production  in  the  Cauvery  delta  was  only  825,500  tons\u2014compared  with  an  annual \naverage of 1.6 million tons in 2009\u20132014. Climate change is expected to exacerbate such \nvulnerabilities,  so  the  need  to  upgrade  the  infrastructure  is  urgent,  as  is  better  water \nmanagement to meet the present and future needs. \n \n6.  At the field level, water use is generally inefficient because of high distribution and field \nlosses,  low  priority  given  to  water  conservation,  and  highly  consumptive  crops.  Rising \ntemperatures and uncertainties related to future rainfall demonstrate a need for stronger water \nmanagement. It is essential to support the information systems with robust monitoring networks, \ngood  data  archiving,  and  an  interface  to  enable  better  decision-making  in  water  resource \nmanagement. \n \n7.  Following the 2013 Supreme Court decision, the Water Resources Department (WRD) \nwithin  the  Public Works  Department  prepared  the  Cauvery  Modernization  Proposal,  which \nincludes  the  rehabilitation  of  most  of  the  flood  control  and  irrigation  infrastructure,  and \nimprovements to on-farm irrigation systems in the Cauvery delta.7 The four main irrigation \nsystems in the delta are Lower Coleroon Anicut, Cauvery, Vennar, and Grand Anicut. Of the \nfour, the Vennar system is considered to be the most critical in terms of vulnerability to flooding \nand in need of improvements. \n \n8.  The Vennar system. Irrigation to the delta is supplied from the Cauvery River at the \nGrand Anicut, where the Cauvery River bifurcates into Cauvery and Vennar. The irrigation \nsystems in the delta have evolved over centuries, whereby natural rivers were adapted to serve \nas irrigation canals and drains. The result is a complex network of natural and built canals and \ndrains. Most of the regulatory structures in the Vennar system are more than 100 years old and \nsome are fully dilapidated. Shoals formed in the center of the channels hinder the free flow of \nwater,  and  some  tail-end  command  areas  no  longer  receive  surface  water.  Existing \nembankments  are  damaged  or  weak.  At  the  operational  level,  water  distribution  is  not \nsystematic and is based mainly on the judgment of WRD staff in response to requests from \nfarmers. At the farm level, the application of irrigation water is inherently inefficient. \n \n9.  The  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nfinancing to upgrade the Vennar system. On-farm irrigation systems will be improved through \nanother project to be financed by the state government and other development partners. The \nproposed project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India,8 \nwhich seeks to overcome water insecurity and help communities adapt to climate change, and \n                                                \n7  State Government of Tamil.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n17.  Hydraulic modeling of the main channel system was a key component of technical due \ndiligence in the project\u2019s preparation, supported by hydrological modeling of the catchments in \nthe project area to provide runoff response to rainfall. Models were run for 25-, 50-, and 100-\nyear return events with and without climate change. While the modeling has accuracy limitations \nfor  lack  of  data,  it  provided  a  sound  and  rational  basis  for  evaluating  the  differences  in \nfloodwater levels and flood extents between the existing and proposed conditions, both with and \nwithout climate change impacts. The climate change projections indicate a range of scenarios, \nand  common  themes  are  higher  sea  levels,  reduced  dry-season  rainfall,  and  increased \nlikelihood of severe rainfall events. Designs included strengthening and raising the height of \nembankments to withstand a 25-year return flood, and rehabilitating principal regulators to pass \na 50-year return flood. The design options comprised (i) reviewing the rationale for the proposed \ndesign,  specific  components,  and  operational  modes;  (ii)  considering  a  range  of  technical \nalternatives and their technical and economic viability; (iii) maximizing the beneficiary areas and \ncommunities;  (iv)  minimizing  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts;  and  (v) optimizing \ntimescales for project implementation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n18.  Maintaining agricultural production at present levels by upgrading irrigation structures \nand rehabilitating pumping schemes to restore water supplies to the original command areas is \nexpected to yield agricultural benefits. Repairing or reconstructing drainage sluices and infalls, \nsiphons, and tail-end regulators will help crops in the lower end of drainage areas to avoid flood \ndamage.  A  risk-modeling  framework  was  used  to  estimate  the  project  benefits  since  the \nremaining life of the irrigation and drainage structures and of the pumping schemes to be \nrepaired or replaced is not known with certainty. The economic analysis indicates that the \nproject  is  economically  viable,  with  the  risk  model  measuring  an  overall  project  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  ranging  from  a  minimum  17.2%  to  a  maximum  19.8%.  The  mean \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  was  18.3%.  The  project  remained  economically  viable  to \nsensitivity analysis on reduced project benefits and increased investment costs. \n \n19.  A distribution and poverty analysis estimated the distribution of the benefits among \nvarious stakeholder categories: farmers, marginal farmers (with less than 1 ha of land), hired \nlabor and/or landless, and the government and/or society. The results indicate that the bulk of \nthe net benefits will go to the farmers (58%) and marginal farmers (42%), and a poverty impact \nratio19 of 26% was estimated. The financial sustainability of the project will depend on the timely \navailability of operation and maintenance (O&M) funds allocated by the government to WRD. \nThe maintenance needs are significant, but capital investments have historically been very low \nas  a  result  of  the  water  dispute.  The  system  requires  a  complete  overhaul,  and  routine \n                                                \n19 The proportion of net discount benefits that go to the poor. ", "7 \nmaintenance alone is insufficient to improve the performance of the system. WRD spends about \nRs1,573 million annually on the O&M of about 4.1 million ha, indicating an average expenditure \nof Rs384 per ha. The state government has committed to borrow to invest in capital expenditure, \nand it has also committed to use its own O&M resources amounting to 2% of the capital costs \nper annum. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessments  were undertaken for \nWRD.  WRD will be responsible for implementing the project, as well as the O&M of the \ninfrastructure after its commissioning. The financial management assessment concludes that \nWRD has sufficient experience and capacity to manage the project funds. The overall pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is rated moderate, primarily due to the absence of an \ninternal audit function, delays in completion of annual audited financial statements, and manual \nrecord keeping. Risk mitigating measures are described in detail in the PAM, including an \noutsourced  internal  audit  and  augmented  staffing,  based  on  which  the  overall  financial \nmanagement  arrangements  are  considered  adequate  for  the  project  The  pre-mitigation \nprocurement risk is rated substantial. WRD has experience in competitive bidding processes but \nis accustomed to different procedures. It also has limited experience in recruiting consulting \nfirms. The project will provide training on ADB\u2019s rules and procedures, and a procurement \nspecialist will directly support the project management unit (PMU). \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and WRD. The results of the financial management and procurement \ncapacity assessment, and the specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  Over 40% of the inhabitants of Tamil Nadu depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. \nThe project aims to sustain agricultural production by reducing the impact of flooding and \nimproving the reliability of irrigation water supply. Since the majority of rural households are \nengaged in agriculture, the project will help reduce poverty in rural areas. In addition, around \n335,000  households  will  benefit  from  fewer  flood  risks.  Farmers  consulted  during  project \npreparation indicated that uncertainty in production arising from unreliability in irrigation water has \nput  them  in  the trap  of  noninstitutional  borrowing.  The  census  and  socioeconomic  surveys \nundertaken indicate that 53.2% of project-affected people depend on cultivation or agricultural \nlabor. The average monthly family income of households20 was reported as Rs10,831 and, \namong them, 30% of households reported an income lower than the updated state-specific \npoverty line of Rs1,677 per capita per month. 21 Therefore, the proposed project will benefit the \nmajority of the community in the project area. The project is classified as some gender elements, \nwhere women will benefit from (i) capacity-building programs for WRD staff, (ii) increased \nparticipation in water management through membership in channel stakeholder groups, and \n(iii) skills training for farmers on improved agricultural practices. \n \n                                                \n20 The census survey identified 3,316 project-affected households, but only 2,511 households provided income \ndetails. \n21 The Planning Commission of India\u2019s state-specific poverty line for 2011\u20132012 is Rs1,081.94 for rural Tamil Nadu. \nThis was raised to Rs1,676.54 in October 2015. \n ", "8 \n23.  The contractors will be required to implement appropriate measures regarding the health \nand safety of men and women who work at the construction sites. The contractors, in close \ncoordination  with the  PMU,  will conduct awareness programs on  the prevention of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, drug use, gender issues, and core labor standards. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  Involuntary resettlement. The project will not involve any land acquisition since all \nworks along the six channels will be within the available right-of-way. The project will have a \nsignificant  impact  because  3,235  households  in  informal  settlements  on  the  channel \nembankments\u2014comprising 2,642 residences, 478 shops, and 115 cattle sheds and/or other \nsheds\u2014will be displaced. In total, 12,887 persons will be affected. Therefore, the project is \nclassified  as  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  A \nresettlement plan complying with government regulations on resettlement rehabilitation and \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  for  involuntary  resettlement  was  prepared.22 The  plan  was \nprepared in consultation with the affected people and comprehensively assesses the impacts of \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  It  provides  adequate  measures  to  manage  these  impacts.  The \nresettlement plan is based on the detailed design and therefore is considered final, unless \nunanticipated changes in design are encountered during project implementation. To strengthen \nthe capacity of WRD in implementing the resettlement plan, the PMU will be assisted by a \nnongovernment  organization  and  a  social  development  consultant.  An  external  monitoring \nconsultant will also be engaged to monitor the implementation of the resettlement plan. WRD \nhas  secured  the  budget  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan,  including  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants. \n \n25.  Indigenous people. The due diligence found that there are no indigenous peoples, as \ndefined  by  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  in  the  project-affected  areas.  The  project  is \nclassified as category C for the indigenous peoples safeguard. \n \n26.  Environment. The project is classified as category B in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and an initial environmental examination with an environmental management \nplan was prepared.23 The project involves resectioning channels; rehabilitating embankments; \nde-silting channel beds; and constructing new or upgrading existing regulators, drainage outfalls, \nirrigation outfalls, and infalls. Key negative impacts associated with the project are akin to those \nrelated to construction, such as noise, dust, impacts on embankment vegetation, increased \nturbidity due to de-silting operations, and impacts associated with the disposal of dredged \nmaterial.  Mitigation  measures  were  identified  and  included  in  the  initial  environmental \nexamination  and  environmental  management  plan.  The  positive  impacts  include  improved \nconveyance of water to downstream users and fewer flooding risks. The PMU and project \nimplementation units will be assisted by an environment specialist who is part of the project \nimplementation  consultancy  team  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan. In addition, WRD staff will be trained on environmental monitoring and \nmanagement.  Stakeholders  were  consulted  and  will  continue  to  be  consulted  during \nimplementation, as described in the stakeholder communications strategy. A grievance redress \nmechanism to manage both social and environmental issues will be established prior to project \nimplementation. \n \n                                                \n22 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

ASSURANCES \n \n28.  The  governments  of  India  and  Tamil  Nadu,  and  WRD  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n29.  The governments of India and Tamil Nadu and WRD have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to India for the Climate Adaptation in Vennar Subbasin in Cauvery Delta Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n13 May 2016 \n \n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n(i) Coastal districts are protected from cyclones and flooding exacerbated by climate change (Vision Tamil \nNadu, 2023)a \n(ii) Innovative and inclusive economic growth, including agricultural growth, in Tamil Nadu is accelerated \n(Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017)b \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2021     \nClimate-resilient  a. 3,500 ha of land in tail-end  a.
