The first energy policy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was prepared in 1981 and \nthe second policy2 paper was published in 1995. The energy policy was reviewed in 20003 and \nrecommended four operational priorities: (i) reduce poverty by creating energy infrastructure for \nsustainable economic growth and increasing access to energy for the poor, particularly in rural \nareas; (ii) promote private sector involvement by restructuring the energy sector and creating an \nenabling environment for private investors; (iii) addressing regional and/or global environmental \nimpacts,  especially  acid  rain  problems,  supporting  clean  energy  and  the  Kyoto  Protocol \nmechanisms for greenhouse gas abatement, and financing renewable energy projects; and (iv) \npromoting regional cooperation. The 2000 review further recommended that the Energy Policy be \nreviewed after 5 years. \n \n2.  According  to  some  recently  published  international  reports, 4  the  world\u2019s  energy \nconsumption has reached unsustainable levels. Increased economic growth has encouraged \nincreased energy consumption, especially fossil fuels, resulting in increased greenhouse gas \ngeneration. The effects of such consumption has resulted in harmful effects on the climate, such \nas an increase in the earth\u2019s temperature and abnormal climatic conditions. It was considered by \nADB Management that ADB should assess its energy sector operations to realign its energy \nstrategy to address the needs of its developing member countries (DMCs) in a more sustainable \nway and encourage clean energy development. ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment\u2019s (RSDD) Energy, Transport, and Water Division (RSID) initiated a review5 of ADB\u2019s \nenergy operations to evaluate previous operations, examine the relevance of the current energy \npolicies, and prepare a new strategy that will address the emerging needs of DMCs. A draft paper \nwas prepared by RSID and reviewed by the Energy Community of Practice (CoP) in January \n2007. The paper is currently being revised and will be circulated for interdepartmental comments \nin March 2007. The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) is currently conducting a parallel \nevaluation of ADB\u2019s energy sector operations. OED\u2019s recommendations will feed into the new \nstrategy as appropriate. \n \n3.  The revised energy policy is being developed within the framework of the existing policy, \nwhich continues to be robust and relevant. Nevertheless, a focused approach is needed to \naddress the tremendous increase in energy demand in Asia and the effects of unsustainable \nenergy consumption on the environment. Accordingly, RSDD designed the Clean Energy and \nEnvironment Program (CEEP), which is a comprehensive strategic program to assist DMCs \nachieve measurable changes in their energy use pattern and secure a low carbon sustainable \nenergy future. The program covers a number of specific initiatives, such as the ongoing multi-\ndonor-funded Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Climate Change (REACH), the Energy \nEfficiency Initiative (EEI), the Carbon Market Initiative (CMI), Energy for All, Energy Efficiency in \nTransport, and Development of Knowledge Hubs. The proposed energy strategy will encompass \nthese initiatives within its framework and propose a way forward for ADB and its DMCs. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1981.

According to ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy6 and Staff Guide to Consultation and \nParticipation,7 ADB should seek the active participation of its shareholders and other interested \nindividuals  and  organizations  during  the  development  and  review  of  its  thematic  strategies \n(Component  1).  Therefore,  the  first  component  of  this  TA  is  to  finance  the  stakeholder \nconsultation process for the energy strategy. Second, building on the success of last year\u2019s Clean \nEnergy Week, it is proposed to organize a Clean Energy Forum as a sub-event of the proposed \nAsia-Pacific  Sustainable  Development  Summit  (Component  2).  This  will  be  a  forum  for \ndisseminating  the  new  energy  strategy  and  consultations  on  moving  forward  with  the  new \ninitiatives. Further, it is proposed to publish a number of technical papers of current relevance \n(knowledge products) (Component 3) that will be disseminated among ADB and DMC staff for \neasy reference on key issues. The scope and direction of the proposed technical assistance \n(TA)8 grant for the Energy Sector Strategy and Development Program 2007 was defined in the \nconcept paper cleared by Management in July 2006. This TA is included in the core TA program \nof RSDD for 2007. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  For ADB to be effective and relevant, it must work together with a broad spectrum of \npeople  and  organizations.  Strong  partnerships  have  to  be  created  with  a  broad  range  of \nstakeholders  and  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs).  Information  sharing  is  essential  to \nparticipatory  development,  and  ADB  must  demonstrate  openness  and  accountability  by \nproactively sharing information with, and seeking suggestions and feedback, from stakeholders\u2014\nespecially when preparing an important strategic document such as the energy strategy. Global \nwarming and climate change are contentious issues, which, coupled with the need for energy \nsecurity,  have  far-reaching  ramifications  and  attract  worldwide  interest.  Consultations,  both \nexternal and internal, are important so that concerns of relevant key stakeholders are taken into \naccount  while  preparing  the  strategy.  Further,  ADB  will  benefit  from  the  knowledge  and \nexperience gained from such consultations, which will enhance the quality of the strategy. \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The main impact of this regional TA will be improved sustainable supply of energy. \n \n7.  The intended outcome of this TA will be increased support for ADB\u2019s energy sector \noperations from a range of stakeholders and experts. In addition, the TA will provide stakeholders \nwith comprehensive updates on recent energy issues, policy requirements, and energy outlook \nfor the region. \n \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2005.

Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Component 1: Consultation and Participation \n8.  The consultation process is designed to be implemented in three steps. The first step, \nwhich has been completed, included interaction with DMC governments, executing agencies, \nenergy utilities, CSOs, educational institutions, multilateral and bilateral funding agencies, and \nenergy research institutes. Based on these consultations and further in-depth analysis, a draft \nstrategy has been developed. This draft will be discussed within ADB through interdepartmental \nand management reviews and an informal ADB\u2019s Board of Directors seminar. Staff Instructions \nand the Staff Guide to Consultation and Participation (footnote 7) recommend that ADB should \nundergo consultations with external stakeholders through direct interaction and electronic media. \nThese will be carried out after review of the draft strategy and consent of the Management \nCommittee, and will be implemented through regional workshops and electronic consultations. \nParticipants will be selected after consultations with operations departments. Therefore, in the \nsecond stage, three regional workshops will be held. Online consultations via the energy strategy \nwebsite and e-mail, as well as external consultations with experts, will run in parallel with the \nvarious workshops. In the third stage, the approved energy strategy will be posted on the ADB \nwebsite for information. Printed booklets will be distributed through ADB\u2019s Public Information \nCenter. \n \n2.  Component  2:  Clean  Energy  Forum  of  the  Asia-Pacific  Sustainable \nDevelopment Summit \n \n9.  The Clean Energy Forum will build on the success of the 2006 Clean Energy Week, which \nprovided  a  unique  opportunity  for  DMCs\u2019  clients,  donor  governments,  CSOs,  and  other \nstakeholders of the region to interact and exchange lessons learned in the energy sector. In \naddition, at the 2006 Clean Energy Week, ADB benefited from the active participation and expert \nguidance from a number of participants on the needs of the region and recommendations on how \nADB\u2019s Energy Strategy should be realigned. The Clean Energy Forum will continue to focus on \nclean energy, energy security, and sustainable development\u2014with special focus on energy for all \nand  private  participation  in  clean  energy  development.  Participants  will  be  selected  after \nconsultations with operations departments. The timing for the event is important for ADB. This \nforum will be an ideal setting for disseminating ADB\u2019s energy strategy and to seek cooperation \nand consultations on the implementation of the various initiatives. ADB will also collaborate with \nother  development  agencies  such  as  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID) in organizing a forum on clean energy financing workshop under USAID\u2019s Eco Asian \nClean Development and Climate Program. The French Development Agency (AFD) has indicated \ninterest in participating and has proposed to sponsor speakers on regulatory mechanism for \nenergy efficiency and new technologies. \n \n3.  Component 3: Knowledge Products\u2013Technical Notes \n10.  The Asia and Pacific region is experiencing rapid economic growth, resulting in increased \nenergy demand. According to estimates released by the International Energy Agency,9 total world \nenergy demand is expected to grow from 7,261 million tons of oil equivalent (mtoe) in 2004 to \n17,095 mtoe in 2030. As far as the electricity sector is concerned, coal-based power generation \nwill account for about 80% of total electricity generation in 2030. Most of this increased demand \nwill be in the People\u2019s Republic of China and India, with some increased demand in other \n                                                 \n9  IEA. 2006. World Energy Outlook 2006. Paris. \n ", "4   \nemerging  economies  such  as  Indonesia  and  Viet Nam.  Such  increased  use  of  coal  has \nunsustainable effects on the climate. Carbon dioxide emissions have already reached high levels \nand their effect on the climate is obvious. Some of these effects are abnormal weather patterns \nexperienced  recently,  such  as  intense  storms,  severe  and  frequent  droughts  and  floods, \naccelerated melting of glaciers, rise in sea level, higher frequency of forest fires, shortage of \nfreshwater, threatened crop production and aquaculture, and higher incidence of heat-related and \ninfectious diseases. Hence, there is a need to utilize coal in a more sustainable and efficient \nmanner. Various cleaner technologies have been developed and some are in the process of \ndevelopment. The key issue will be to facilitate the path of technology transfer that is beneficial to \nall stakeholders. Initially, it is proposed to commission a technical paper that highlights the effects \nof  coal-based  power  generation,  its  economies,  need  for  new  technologies,  time  frame  for \ndevelopment, prospects of technology transfer, research costs, government policies and options \nfor facilitating such transfer, and how multilateral agencies can help. Subsequent technical notes \nwill focus on further development of zero-carbon technologies, and energy efficiency. \n \n11.  For a sustained and transparent electricity market, strict and fair regulatory mechanisms \nneed to be in place as part of a phased reform and restructuring of the sector. Private sector \nparticipation will also increase to meet growth in demand. In Asia, results of power sector reforms \nhave been mixed\u2014partially successful in some, and unsuccessful in others. It is clear that \u201cone-\nsize-fits\u2013all\u201d is not the right approach. Therefore, there is a need to provide DMCs with a history \nof the reforms, its development over time, costs, social and legal issues, lessons learned with \ncase studies, and a list of options to achieve a transparent and fair electricity market that will \nfocus on the benefits of the consumer. RSID will collaborate with other departments involved in \ngovernance\u2014especially the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) which is coordinating and \ncollaborating with RSID on various energy regulation projects. It is intended that issues identified \nand discussed in this paper will be further developed and researched under OGC\u2019s energy \nregulation knowledge products. \n \n12.  Advances in economic growth and associated increased energy demand have resulted in \nhuge investments in the energy sector. Growth potential is huge and DMCs are addressing \nincreased  energy  needs  with  a  variety  of  approaches,  including  technology  transfer  and \ninnovative financing. Nevertheless, about 1 billion people in the Asia and Pacific region continue \nto live without access to modern forms of energy. Many DMCs have successfully embarked on \naddressing this important social need with some success but much more needs to be done if the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) are to be achieved. It has been established that modern \nenergy access, though not identified as an MDG, will contribute to the achievement of almost all \nthe MDG goals. A number of options are being explored, such as grid extensions and off-grid \nsystems.  In  such  cases,  the  option  of  community-based  organization  setting  up  their  own \ndistributed off-grid system could be sustained, and needs to be explored.  \n13.  Taking the above aspects into consideration, ADB proposes to publish technical notes \nthat will be made available to ADB and DMCs as knowledge products. These will be prepared by \nADB along with experts or through energy research centers. Condensed versions will be included \nas part of the forthcoming publication on Energy Outlook and Data Book 2007 for the Asia and \nPacific Region. In 2007, it is initially proposed to cover the following topics: \n(i)  Low  Carbon Emitting Technologies in Electricity Generation \u2013 Options and \nFuture Outlook \n(ii)  Power Sector Regulation \u2013 Lessons Learned and The Way Forward \n(iii)  Community-Based Distributed Power Generation \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the regional TA, estimated at $400,000, will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  various  components  of  the  TA  will  be  implemented  separately  according  to \nrequirements and schedule starting April 2007, and will be completed by June 2008. ADB, \nthrough RSDD/RSID, will serve as the Executing Agency. No specific DMC has been identified to \nundertake the activities of the regional TA. However, any activity funded by this regional TA will \nonly commence in a particular DMC after ADB has obtained a no-objection letter from the \nrespective government as to inclusion of such DMC in the regional TA. \n1.  Consultation and Participation \n16.  Three  subregional  stakeholder  consultations  and/or  workshops  will  be  conducted  in \nselected key DMCs (to be determined). One international consultant, a consultative process \nfacilitator, will be recruited for 4 person-months. A national consultation workshop coordinator will \nbe recruited for research and workshop coordination support for 5 person-months. Mission travel \nwill be required for consultants to the selected countries for subregional consultation workshops. \nTerms  of  reference  for  the  international  and  national  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nconsultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time).\n \n2.   Clean Energy Forum of the Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Summit \n17.  The Clean Energy Forum will be held in ADB headquarters as a sub-event under the \nproposed Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Summit in November 2007. The TA will finance \nthe expenses of some of the DMC officials, civil society, speakers, and other participants; and \nalso include other workshop expenses (materials, handouts, snacks, cocktail reception, and other \nservices). One national event coordinator will be recruited for 3 months in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants to assist RSDD in organizing the workshop.  \n \n3.  Knowledge Products  \n18.  Three  well-known  international  experts  or  reputed  energy  research  centers  will  be \nassigned  to  develop  high  quality  technical  papers  which  will  be  sent  to  peer  reviewers  for \ncomments  and  guidance  before  publication  and  dissemination.  These  consultants  will  be \nrecruited for a period of about 2 months each in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Energy Sector Strategy and Development 2007 and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nDeveloping member  \u2022 Increased number  \u2022 National, regional  \u2022  DMCs will implement \ncountries (DMCs)  of clean energy  and/or country  their clean energy \nhave a sustainable  projects   statistical reports, such  policies \nsupply of energy    as annual reports of   \n    the energy ministry  Risks \n  \u2022  DMCs face financial \n  crisis \n  \u2022  Policy change \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOutcome      Risks \nIncreased support for  \u2022 Majority of  \u2022  Technical assistance  \u2022 Stakeholders\u2019 opinion \nAsian Development  participants  (TA) workshop report   may not be favorable \nBank (ADB) energy  support the   \noperation from  strategy \nstakeholders   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

International Consultant, Consultative Process Facilitator (4 person-months, \nintermittent) \n \n1.   Background and Objective \n \n1.  In this case, consultations will be internal and external (with governments, development \npartners, and civil society\u2014including civil society organizations [CSOs]), private sector, academia, \nand donor agencies. In addition, well-known experts will be requested to provide peer review. \n \n2.  The  consultations  will  be  complex,  involving  agencies  and  institutions  with  different \nperspectives as well as diverse development interests and objectives. However, it is recognized \nthat the groups share an interest in ensuring that development projects financed by ADB avoid or \nminimize adverse impacts, and that mitigation measures are developed and agreed upon with \nstakeholders,  especially  affected  persons.  External  consultations  will  involve  governments  of \ndeveloped and developing countries, CSOs, academia, research institutions, workers and business \nrepresentatives, multilateral and bilateral aid agencies, and institutions that are closely involved in \nprocessing and implementing ADB-financed projects. The consultations will include private sector \nrepresentatives who are involved in ADB-financed projects either directly or through financial \nintermediaries. \n \n2.   Scope of Work \n \n3.  The  facilitator  will  ensure  the  smooth  organization  and  implementation  of  the  regional \nconsultations,  and  any  other  meetings  that  may  be  required.  The  facilitator  will  accurately \ndocument  the  outcomes  of  the  meetings  and  the  positions  of  the  participants,  particularly \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and CSOs representatives. The facilitator will help review \nexchanges and respond to queries raised by participants and civil society representatives. \n \n4.  The facilitator will have some exposure to current and emerging energy sector issues in \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) and international financial institutions. The facilitator should \nbe familiar with the role, functions, and operations of multilateral agencies such as ADB; and will \npreferably be involved in multilateral development and NGO-related activities, either as a member \nof a CSO or as a holder of a position that requires interaction with such organizations.

Knowledge Products \n \n  1.  Background and Objectives \n \n16.  The Asia and Pacific region is experiencing rapid economic growth, resulting in increased \nenergy demand. According to estimates, total world energy demand is expected to grow from \n7,261 million tons of oil equivalent (mtoe) to 17,095 mtoe in 2030. The corresponding financial \nrequirement is around $21 billion. Such rapid growth in demand will need a judicious review of \noptions and planning. As far as the electricity sector is concerned, coal-based power generation \nwill account for about 80% of the total electricity generation in 2030. Such increased use of coal \nhas unsustainable effects on the climate. Carbon dioxide emissions have already reached high \nlevels and their effect on the climate is obvious. Some of these effects are abnormal weather \npatterns experienced recently, such as intense storms, severe and frequent droughts and floods, \naccelerated melting of glaciers, rises in sea level, higher frequency of forest fires, shortage of \nfreshwater, threatened crop production and aquaculture, and higher incidence of heat-related and \ninfectious diseases. Hence, there is a need to utilize coal in a more sustainable and efficient \nmanner. Various cleaner technologies have been developed and some are in the process of \ndevelopment. The key issue will be to facilitate the path of technology transfer that is beneficial to \nall stakeholders. ADB is planning to commission a technical paper that highlights the effects of \ncoal-based  power  generation,  its  economies,  need  for  new  technologies,  time  frame  for \ndevelopment, prospects of technology transfer, research costs, government policies and options \nfor facilitating such transfer, and how multilateral agencies can help. \n \n17.  For a sustained and transparent electricity market, strict and fair regulatory mechanisms \nneed to be in place as part of a phased reform and restructuring of the sector. Private sector \nparticipation will also increase to meet the growth in demand. In Asia, results of power sector \nreforms have been mixed\u2014partially successful in some, and unsuccessful in others. It is clear that \n\u201cone-size-fits\u2013all\u201d is not the right approach. Therefore, there is a need to provide DMCs with a \nhistory of the reforms, its development over time, costs, social and legal issues, lessons learned \nwith case studies, and a list of options to achieve a transparent and fair electricity market which will \nfocus on the benefits of the consumer. RSID will collaborate with other departments involved in \ngovernance,  especially  the  Office  of  the  General  Counsel  (OGC)  which  is  coordinating  and \ncollaborating with RSID on various energy regulation projects. It is intended that issues identified \nand  discussed  in  this  paper  will  be  further  developed  and  researched  under  OGC\u2019s  energy \nregulation knowledge products. The proposed technical note on energy regulation will include \n ", "  Appendix 3    13 \nreview of the advances in energy sector regulation, progress achieved, lessons learned, and the \nway forward.  \n \n18.  Advances in economic growth and associated increased energy demand have resulted in \nhuge  investments  in  the  energy  sector.  Growth  potential  is  huge  and  DMCs  are  addressing \nincreased energy needs with a variety of approaches, including technology transfer and innovative \nfinancing. Nevertheless, about 1 billion people of the Asia and Pacific region continue to live \nwithout  access  to  modern  forms  of  energy.  Many  DMCs  have  successfully  embarked  on \naddressing this important social need with some success but much needs to be done if the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  are  to  be  achieved.  A  number  of  options  are  being \nexplored,  such  as  grid  extensions  and  off-grid  systems.  In  such  cases,  community-based \norganization setting up their own distributed off-grid system is an option that can be sustained and \nneeds to be explored.  \n \n19.  Taking the above aspects into consideration, ADB proposes to publish technical notes that \nwill be made available to ADB and DMCs as knowledge products. They will be prepared by ADB \nalong with experts or through energy research centers. Initially, in 2007, it is proposed to cover the \nfollowing topics: \n \n(i)  Low Carbon Emitting Technologies in Electricity Generation \u2013 Options and Future  \n  Outlook \n(ii)  Power Sector Regulation \u2013 Lessons Learned and The Way Forward \n(iii)  Community-Based Distributed Power Generation \n \n2.  Scope of Work \n \n20.  One international consultant with substantial background and knowledge in the field will be \nengaged in March 2007 for each of the three topics listed above for about 2 months each (totaling \n6 months). The document will be completed by July 2007.  \n \n3.  Detailed Tasks \n \n21.  The terms of reference of the author will primarily consist of, but will not be limited to, the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Preparation  of  and  finalization  of  a  tentative  annotated  outline  of  the  paper  in \nconsultation with ADB within 1 week of the start of services. \n(ii)  Review of relevant literature and collection of and analysis of data and information. \n(iii)  Preparation of the document containing, among others, an overview of the energy \nsituation in Asia and the Pacific region, analysis of key issues, relevant data and \nstatistical tables, and key findings, conclusions and recommendations. \n(iv)  Providing drafts of the document in parts, as they are prepared, to seek feedback \nand comments from ADB. The entire document will also be submitted to ADB in \ndraft form for final comments before finalization. \n(v)  Preparing the document containing a foreword, acknowledgment, table of contents, \nacronyms, glossary, and bibliography. \n(vi)  The final draft, incorporating comments from ADB, will be submitted within 1 week \nafter receiving ADB\u2019s comments. \n(vii)  Review of the manuscript, prior to printing of document. \n \n4.  Output \n \n22.  The length of the paper should be about 40\u201350 pages, with appendixes. A shorter version \nof  about  15  pages  should  also  be  provided.  This  will  probably  be  used  as  part  of  ADB\u2019s \nforthcoming publication on energy outlook. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20070314100502+08'00'", "Author": "", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20070319163133+08'00'", "Title": "Energy Sector Strategy and Development 2007"}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  AFD  \u2013  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement  \n(French Development Agency) \n  CoP  \u2013  Community of Practice \nCSO  \u2013  civil society organization \n  DMC  \u2013  developing member country \n  MDG  \u2013  Millennium Development Goal  \n  mtoe           \u2013  million tons of oil equivalent \n  OED           \u2013  Operations Evaluation Department \n  OGC  \u2013  Office of the General Counsel \n  RSDD  \u2013  Regional and Sustainable Development Department \n  RSID  \u2013  Energy, Transport, and Water Division \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  USAID  \u2013  United States Agency for International Development \n       \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  Targeted intervention (MDG) \nSector  \u2013  Energy  \nThemes  \u2013  Sustainable economic growth, environmental sustainability  \nSubtheme  \u2013  Civil society participation \n \n \n \n \nNOTE \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nVice President  U.
