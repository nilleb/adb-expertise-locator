THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Government of Samoa requested the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance \nfor Central Cross Island Road Upgrading (the ensuing Project)\u2013a priority investment in transport \nsector. Samoa\u2019s land transport depends on key arterial roads that serve the two main islands, \nUpolu where capital Apia is located, and Savai\u2019i. Upolu is served by three cross-island roads \nstrategically located at the eastern, western, and central sections. The Central Cross Island Road \nis the key arterial road connecting West Coast Road in Apia with the South Coast Road in Siumu. \nThe project road is 19.70 kilometers (km) that provides access to eight villages and to the capital, \nApia. The existing two-lane narrow carriageway (4 meters\u20135 meters) road with surface seal \ncarrying up to 6,000 average daily traffic (ADT) along first 5 km, and up to 1,500 ADT thereafter, \nis unsafe for road users and in need of upgrading. The institutional capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies to plan, execute and maintain investment projects, and managing road \nright-of-way information is limited. \n \n2.  The socioeconomic impacts from road upgrading are expected to (i) improve access to \npublic services, (ii) increase the rate of tertiary education, (iii) provide faster and safer access to \nmedical services, and (iv) spur economic activity in the medium- to long-term through increase in \ntourism activities. Samoa\u2019s economy is based on subsistence level primary production. Crops, \nlivestock, fisheries, and forestry account for 42% of gross domestic product (GDP) and provides \n75% of the employment in the country. Tourism is growing and now represents 25% of the GDP. \nAccording to the Samoan Central Bank, the tourism sector is a key driver of country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment as it provides considerable employment and generates foreign exchange. The \nupgraded cross island road will increase access to social services (education, health) and \nemployment opportunities of rural communities, contributing towards the inclusive growth and \ndevelopment of these areas. The climate change proofed road is also a major contribution to the \nisland\u2019s disaster preparedness as it provides an alternate route for evacuation and post disaster \nrelief and rehabilitation work between the northern and southern coasts \n \n \n3.  The upgrading of the project road will result in a more reliable and safer road network.1\nThe project will be aligned with the following impacts as envisioned in the government\u2019s Transport \nSector Plan 2014\u20132019:2 (i) Goal 1 \u2013 strengthen transport sector governance framework; and (ii) \nGoal 2 \u2013 improve, sustain, and climate proof road transport network. \n  \n4.  The indicative amount of ADB financing for the ensuing project is $25 million Asian \nDevelopment Fund (Special Funds). The ensuing grant and the attached transaction technical \nassistance (TA) are listed in the current Country Operations Business Plan, 2018\u20132020.3     \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  Although passable throughout the year, significant sections of the project road have fallen \ninto disrepair and have become a safety concern for commuters as well as pedestrians walking \nalong the roadside. This is especially an issue along the first 3 km of the road which is situated in \na semi-urban area. In 2012, tropical cyclone Evan hit Samoa and caused significant damage to \nits road infrastructure. Some of the critically damaged road sections in the Central Cross Island \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure. 2014. Transport Sector Plan 2014\u20132019. Apia.  \n3  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "2 \nRoad (5 locations with a total of 3,720 km) have since been widened and resurfaced by the \ngovernment. The existing narrow road lanes without adequate pedestrian facilities in semi-urban \nareas, deficient drainage throughout the entire length, as well as unsafe horizontal and vertical \nalignment in hilly road sections will become a significant hazard as traffic levels increase, \nparticularly in wet conditions. \n \n6.  The World Bank and the Government of Australia have provided support to Samoa to \nrestore road infrastructure after cyclone Evan in 2012 under the Enhanced Road Access Project \n(ERAP). Under the ERAP, initial economic viability, technical designs, preliminary safeguards \ndocuments, costs and draft bidding documents were prepared for the Central Cross Island Road \nand other key road links. Initial economic evaluations suggest high rates of economic return. Initial \nassessments of social, economic, and land acquisition and resettlement impacts have also been \nprepared  under  the  ERAP.  The  detailed  design  of  the  Central  Cross  Island  Road  was \ncommissioned to the firm SMEC International. However, further detailed assessments will be \nrequired primarily to resolve road right-of-way issues relating to deficiencies between the MNRE\u2019s \nland registration data and survey done under the ERAP and ensuring road safety and climate and \ndisaster resilience features are incorporated into the project design. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s program for Samoa includes up to $0.8 million in 2018 to help prepare ensuing \nproject.4 To address remaining gaps and prepare a project proposal for ADB financing in 2019, \nthe TA is proposed to: (i) confirm road right-of-way to minimize land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts and finalize the survey plan, (ii) identify potential social and gender  mainstreaming \nactivities  and prepare gender action plan, (iii) finalize initial environmental impact assessment \nand confirm impact on protected areas, (iv) verify project costs, (v) update and finalize economic \nanalysis, (vi) finalize road safety features and components,5 (vii) review technical specifications \nfor climate resilience features, (viii) prepare detailed land acquisition and resettlement plans \nincluding detailed measurement survey and inventory of losses, (ix) prepare implementation plan \nand procurement documentation, and (x) undertake institutional capacity and risk assessments \n(financial management, governance, and procurement) for project implementation. The TA will \nalso make recommendations on other priority projects identified by the Government of Samoa for \nADB financing in terms of initial technical feasibility.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Feasibility study on ensuing project finalized. A due diligence will be \nundertaken to confirm and update the technical and economic feasibility of proposed solutions \nprepared under ERAP and prepare the necessary planning documents as identified in paragraph \n7, in particular, tasks (i) to (v).  \n \n9.  Output  2:  Engineering  design  components,  procurement,  safeguards,  and \nimplementation plans confirmed and prepared. The engineering design documents, technical \nspecifications  prepared  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  ERAP  program  will  be  reviewed,  detailed \nresettlement plans prepared, overall procurement and project implementation plan prepared as \nidentified in paragraph 7, in particular, tasks (vi) to (x). \n  \n                                                \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 March 2018. \n5  The support of the Transport Sector Group Secretariat of SDCC will be sought to carry out a road safety audit of the \nexisting and new road using the existing contract of the Secretariat with the International Road Assessment Program \n(iRAP). The road safety audit will focus on pedestrians for the urban and semi-urban sections of the road and on \nvehicle occupants for the full road. A road safety analysis of the existing school on the road will also be explored. \n ", "3 \n10.  Output 3: Institutional capacity strengthening plan prepared. An assessment of the \nroad subsector as well as the institutional capacity of executing and implementing agencies to \nplan, execute and maintain investment projects will be undertaken, and a capacity strengthening \nplan  prepared  as  a  specific  output  under  the  ensuing  project.  Capacity  assessment  and \nstrengthening plan will also be undertaken for the MNRE including initial support in managing \nroad right-of-way information. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n1. \n \n12.  The government will provide final design, counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, data and information access, facilitation of liaisons with stakeholders, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. The Transport, Energy and Natural Resources Division of the \nPacific  Department  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  consultants.  The  executing  and \nimplementing agencies of the government, as indicated in Table 1 below, will provide necessary \ncounterpart support, and guide the implementation of the TA to achieve the TA outputs and \ndesired outcomes within the agreed implementation period.   \n \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  June 2018\u2013June 2019 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agency  Land Transport Authority \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: SSS  30 person-months  $700,000 \n(lump sum contract) \nIndividual: ICS  8 person-months  $50,000 \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants \nShopping  1 contract  $50.000 \nAdvance contracting and  Consulting services \nretroactive financing \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  The  equipment  will  be  turned  over  to  the  recipient \narrangement upon TA completion  government/agency  or  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \ninstructions. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SSS = single source selection, ICS = individual consultant selection, TA = technical \nassistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "4 \n15.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.6 SMEC International is proposed to be recruited using Single Source \nSelection (SSS) to prepare the remaining due diligence and project preparation work for ADB \nfinancing of the ensuing project.7 The use of the SSS method is appropriate as it presents a clear \nadvantage over competition and the activities represent a natural continuation of previous work \ncarried out by the SMEC International under the World Bank-financed ERAP project. It is essential \nfor time and cost efficiency purposes, continuity of downstream work in terms of technical \napproach, experience acquired and continued professional liability of SMEC International. The \nLand Transport Authority and the World Bank evaluated the performance of SMEC International \nas satisfactory in the activities completed up to date. SMEC International will be asked to prepare \ntechnical and financial proposals based on the terms of reference, which shall then be negotiated. \n \n16.  The TA will also require 8 person-months of individual consultants to carry out capacity \nassessment of the MNRE and to support in the implementation of the resettlement plan.  \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s procurement. ADB will purchase through the consulting firm above the necessary \nequipment to provide initial support to the MNRE to improve its land survey system (GPS and \nother field instruments). The procurement method will be shopping for 1 contract. Procurement of \ngoods will follow ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) and disposal will follow \nrelevant  project  administration  instructions.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  Detailed engineering design. The detailed design is being financed under the World \nBank\u2019s ERAP project and will be completed and separately funded by the Land Transport \nAuthority.  In  this  regard,  all  professional  liabilities  in  relation  to  the  technical  designs  and \nspecifications will rest with the design firm engaged under the ERAP. The executing agency may \nseek direct redress from the consultant for any defect liability. This is confirmed by the executing \nagency through the Memorandum of Understanding of the reconnaissance mission.  \n \nE.  Governance \n \n19.  The TA will undertake financial management and financial sustainability assessments, \nprocurement capacity assessment, and prepare risk management plan.  \n \n \n                                                \n6  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Government will finance the cost of remaining detailed design at estimated $400,000 (UNDP may finance the gap). \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.
