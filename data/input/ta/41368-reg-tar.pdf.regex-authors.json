INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The governments of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Viet \nNam (the governments) requested technical assistance (TA)1 from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to support the preparation of the regional Mekong Water Supply and Sanitation Project \n(MWSSP). The project intends to improve the water supply and sanitation services in nine \nsecondary towns in the economic corridors (EC) in the three countries (the \u201cthree countries\u201d). \nThe TA is included in the regional cooperation operations business plan for the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  2008\u20132010,2 and  the  country  operations  business  plans  2008\u20132010  for \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam3 as a firm TA for 2008. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited \nViet Nam (7\u201310 March), Lao PDR (11\u201314 March), and Cambodia (15\u201317 March) and reached \nunderstanding  with  each    country  on  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  activities,  cost, \nimplementation and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s GMS regional cooperation strategy and program4 seeks to promote economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty by supporting enhanced connectivity and increased competitiveness \nand  a  greater  sense  of  community.  The  GMS  Program  has  made  significant  progress  in \naccelerating physical connectivity between the six GMS countries5 through the development of \nthe subregional road corridors. Connectivity has led to increased trade and movement of people \nand goods across and between the countries. By 2012, all mainland Southeast Asian countries \nwill be interconnected by a series of roads or transport corridors.  \n \n3.  Access to Safe Water and Sanitation for Economic Development. After the transport \ncorridors are established, the challenge is to develop them into economic growth zones by \nstimulating (i) the shift from agricultural production to other more productive sectors, and (ii) \nincreased domestic and foreign investments and trade. The availability of infrastructure is a \nprecondition for economic growth, requiring major capital investments in urban infrastructure, \nspecifically in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene that will promote health and productivity \nstandards. \n \n4.  Focus on Secondary Towns. Secondary towns in the ECs have high economic growth \npotential  since  they  offer  access  to  markets,  physical  growth  opportunities,  and  low \ndevelopment cost. Since economic growth is a source of opportunities and rising wages, it will \nattract poor migrants from rural areas. Since past investments in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam have been mostly in main cities and provincial towns, WSS coverage in secondary towns \nis invariably much lower than the national average. The expected higher than national growth \nrates and the lower than national WSS coverage level in these towns demonstrate the urgency \nto invest in the WSS sector. \n \n5.  Benefits from a Regional Approach. The economic growth of secondary towns will \nlead to higher income and improved quality of life for their population. Economic growth in the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 May 2008.  \n2  ADB. 2007. 2008\u22122010 Indicative Rolling Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan for the Greater Mekong \nSubregion.

To ensure an equal \ndistribution of economic benefits along the regional corridors, selected secondary towns along \nthe corridors at border crossings, road crossings, and near tourist destinations need to be \ndeveloped to become urban service centers and transport hubs. Such planning for development \nis best done through a regional approach, to increase (i) the effectiveness of the plans, and (ii) \nthe  efficiency  of  the  required  investments  in  infrastructure.  The  regional  approach  is  also \nessential  to  demonstrate  to  the  various  governments  the  high  development  priority  of  the \nsecondary towns. \n \n6.  Past  experiences  of  ADB  and  other  development  partners  in  the  urban  water  and \nsanitation  sector  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  show  that  the  governments  are \nconfronted with similar challenges and can learn much from each other. A regional approach will \nallow the required peer-to-peer exchange of knowledge and experiences at various institutional \nlevels: national, regional, and local governments, and operators.  \n \n7.  High Priority for Sanitation. Except in cases where flooding leads to visible obstruction \nof human or motorized traffic, and despite the increased prevalence of dengue, few local \ngovernments consider sanitation, including drainage, as a main priority for their developing \ntowns.  Urbanization  will  lead  to  increased  population  densities  and  paved  areas,  which \ncombined with the absence of drainage, and liquid and solid waste removal systems, will result \nin major water- and health-related problems.  \n \n8.  Appropriate  and  Affordable  Sanitation.  Governments  often  regard  sanitation  as \nunaffordable due to the high-cost technology required and the lack of a direct revenue stream. \nSanitation projects need to be appropriate and align with community needs and affordability. \nRevenues should be linked to the economic, health, and environmental benefits of hygiene and \nsanitation, while the polluter-pays-principle should be applied to extend the revenue base to \ninclude all the beneficiaries of economic growth, and improved health and environment. \n \n9.  Financial  Sustainability  from Phased  Improvement  of  Service  Levels. Although \nmost water supply investment projects aim to supply potable water 24 hours a day at constant \npressure, in practice  water supply agencies are not able to provide that level of service due to (i) \nlack of human capacity, (ii) lack of financial resources for operation and maintenance, and (iii) \ntechnical problems with the distribution systems (pipes and pumps). Consequently, consumers \nare burdened with high tariffs to cover the investment costs but do not benefit from an improved \nservice  level.  Unwillingness  to  connect  and  pay,  especially  when  alternative  sources  are \navailable, leads to lower cost recovery levels and financial nonsustainability of the investment. \nPhased improvement of service levels combined with incremental service fee increases should \nlead to increased willingness to connect and pay, thus broadening the customer base and \nensuring the technical sustainability of the infrastructure and the financial sustainability of the \nwater utilities. \n \n10.  Financial  Sustainability  and  Setting  of  Service  Fees. Also affecting the financial \nsustainability of water utilities is the level of the service fee, or water tariff. Although the water \ncompanies themselves propose charges for connection and services, the decision to revise \nthese charges is with the policy makers. The staff and management of water companies do not \nalways correctly understand the principles of setting these charges, making it difficult for them to \njustify their proposed fee and tariff structures to the decision makers. Likewise, decision makers \noften lack the knowledge to fully appreciate the justification provided. Improved knowledge on \ntariff-setting policies, principles, and practices is key to achieving agreements on cost recovery \nlevels and improved financial sustainability of the utilities. ", "  3\n \n11.  Leadership, Incentives, and Human Resources Capacity. The lack of management \nand operational capacity of local government and utility staff limits the technical and financial \nsustainability of WSS works. Training courses or on-the-job training may improve capacity but \nwill not be effective without strong leadership and the provision of the proper incentives to \ngovernment  and  utility  staff.  Leadership  is  essential  in  developing  strategic  policies  and \noperational  planning,  while  incentives  to  the  staff  are  important  to  guarantee  that  they \nimplement plans by applying acquired knowledge and skills. All three countries lack qualified \nand skilled professional staff, especially in the more remote provinces.  \n \n12.  Need for Private Sector Involvement. The governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam recognize the need to involve the private sector in providing drinking water, since \ninvestment capital and operational capacity in the public sector are limited.  Small informal \noperators are active in all three countries, while in some cases, formal local and international \noperators enter into service and management contracts but mainly in the large cities. A sound \nregulatory framework and capacity support to small operators to further expand services in \nsmall and secondary towns are preconditions for more private sector investment in the WSS \nsector. \n \n13.  Selection of Project Towns. The towns with the lowest economic development and the \nhighest poverty levels are situated in the east\u2013west EC (EWEC) and southern EC, connecting \nnorthwestern  Cambodia  with  southern  Lao  PDR  and  the  central  region  of  Viet  Nam.  The \nsecondary towns on these corridors have great potential for developing into transport and \ntourisms hubs. Also, the establishment of special economic zones in Savanakhet Province in \nthe Lao PDR and Quang Tri Province in Viet Nam will stimulate economic growth in the nearby \ntowns.  \n \n14.  Within the EWEC, Dong Ha, Quang Tri, Lao Bao, and Cua Viet in Viet Nam were \nidentified for inclusion in the project due to their location along Viet Nam\u2019s north\u2013south road \nconnection and their high population growth level. The current water supply coverage ratio in \nDong Ha and Quang Tri is about 70%, but will decline to 40% by 2020. Lao Bao, situated at the \nborder, and Cua Viet, situated at the South China Sea, are not covered by water supply of \nacceptable quality. In the Lao PDR, the identified towns are Xaibouili, situated at the crossing \nwith Lao\u2019s north-south road connection, and Phalanxai, situated halfway in the EWEC corridor. \nNone of these towns have water supply of acceptable quality. The majority of the residents have \naccess to some kind of latrine that cannot be considered hygienic or improved. The exact \ncoverage ratio is not known. \n \n15.  Three project towns, Khinark in the Lao PDR, and Kratie and Stung Treng in Cambodia, \nare situated in the southern economic corridor. Stung Treng and Khinark are located near the \nLao PDR\u2013Cambodia border, while Kratie and Khinark have great potential to develop into a \ntourism hub. The water supply coverage ratio in the Cambodian towns is around 35%, while \nKhinark is not served by water supply of acceptable quality. In the same towns, the sanitation \ncoverage ratios are not known. \n \n16.  Lessons. ADB together with development partners such as the Norwegian Agency for \nDevelopment Cooperation, Agence Francaise de D\u00e9veloppement, and United Nations Human \nSettlements Programme is actively involved in the WSS sector in all three countries. As a result, \nthe three have a substantial increase in water supply capacity and number of hygienic latrines. \nThe projects demonstrate the need for greater technical and financial sustainability, which can \nbe achieved through policy development, institutional reform, and capacity building.  \n ", "4   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The impact of the TA will be sustainable and improved water supply and sanitation \nfacilities, and safer hygiene practices for the urban population of nine secondary towns in the \nECs  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1 and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \n18.  The outcome of the TA is an agreed-upon design for a project. The main outputs will be: \n(i) agreement on the water supply services level for each town, supported by feasibility studies \non  treatment  options,  the  financial  implications  and  human  capacity  requirements;  (ii) \nunderstanding of the policy and practices of setting user charges for WSS; (iii) a short-term \nsanitation investment plan and a long-term sanitation strategy for each town; (iv) an endorsed \ninstitutional framework and capacity building plan for public utilities; (v) endorsed private sector \ncapacity building plan; and (vi) agreed-upon overall investment project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n19.  The proposed project will be designed to (i) construct facilities to supply continuous and \nsafe water and provide facilities for hygiene and sanitation to 200,000 people living in the nine \nsecondary  towns;  (ii)  develop  and  adopt  a  sanitation  strategy  in  each  of  the  nine  towns, \ncovering short-term and long-term actions, including activities promoting hygiene; (iii) ensure \naffordable  and  sustainable  access  of  poor  urban  population  to  WSS  services;  and  (iv) \nstrengthen  the  institutional,  technical,  and  financial  capacity  of  public  and  private  sector \noperators to provide WSS services. \n \n20.  The TA will determine (i) the WSS service level and technologies to be provided: clean \nor potable water; individual or communal service connections; (ii) the associated user charges \nrequired; and (iii) the financial and technical capacity of utilities and local government; which, \ncombined with a better understanding of the policies and practices of setting user charges, \nshould lead to a realistic project objective and sustainable project. \n \n21.  The sanitation investments need to deliver localized and decentralized solutions, based \non affordability, and topographical and geohydrological circumstances. The project will construct \non-site sanitation facilities, such as improved pit latrines and septic tanks; and decentralized \nsanitation facilities, such as communal septic tanks and waste stabilization ponds, possibly in \ncombination with small bore systems. Full-scale centralized sewer and sewerage treatment \nsystems are not considered appropriate nor affordable. Sanitation will include the disposal of \ngrey water and drainage of residential plots, public areas, and roads. \n \n22.  To  solve  current  problems  and  anticipate  future  ones,  a  sanitation  strategy  will  be \ndeveloped and adopted for each project town. The strategy will establish the current sanitation \nstatus  and  the  desired  sanitation  status;  and  identify  least-cost  technologies,  required \ninvestments, financing sources, implementation and operation arrangements, role and capacity \nof  the  private  sector,  civic  society  and  the  communities.  The  sanitation  strategy,  covering \nsewerage discharge and treatment, and drainage, will be an issue-based, dynamic framework \nfor 5-year investment plans, to be reviewed and updated every 2\u20133 years.  \n  ", "  5\n23.  Concrete measures will be developed to assist and promote private sector involvement \nin  WSS,  leading  to  extended  coverage,  especially  in  difficult-to-reach  poor  urban  areas. \nProvision of WSS services in these areas by public utilities is often not viable, and the local \nprivate sector and civic society organizations may be better equipped to provide such services, \npossibly under contractual agreements with the public service providers. \n \n24.  For each project town, feasibility studies will be prepared, including technical, financial, \neconomic, environmental, and social analyses. The project will develop effective institutional \nframeworks and capacity-building programs for the project towns, in alignment with the current \nADB interventions in the WSS sector in the three countries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n25.  The TA is expected to cost the equivalent of $1,500,000. ADB will provide $1,200,000, of \nwhich (i) $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan; (ii) $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust \nFund, funded by the Government of the Netherlands, for the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility; and (iii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility, \nand administered by ADB. \n \n26.  The governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will finance the remaining \n$300,000 equivalent in kind, which will cover the cost of office accommodation, transport, and \nutilities; remuneration of counterpart staff; and provision of data, reports, and other relevant \ndocuments. The three governments have been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.   The executing agencies (EAs) for the TA will be the Department of Potable Water \nSupply of the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy in Cambodia, the Ministry of Potable \nWater and Transport in the Lao PDR, and Quang Tri\u2019s provincial peoples committee in Viet Nam. \nEach  EA  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  that  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nmanagement and organizing the technical and administrative aspects of the TA. A steering \ncommittee comprising the project management unit directors will be established to provide \nguidance and to oversee implementation of the TA.  \n \n28.  ADB will recruit a team of international and national consultants to provide specialized \nservices totalling 116 person-months (28 international and 88 national). ADB  will engage the \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection method with quality-to-cost ratio \nof 80 to 20, and simplified technical proposals. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.  \n \n29.  ADB will purchase minor equipment, such as computers, printer, and copiers according \nto its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will hand over the \nequipment to the EA at the end of the TA. \n \n30.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 7 months, commencing by November 2008 \nand ending by May 2009. The TA consultants will submit (i) within 1 month of TA start-up, an \ninception report, which will propose the methodology for carrying out activities for the duration of \n ", "6   \nthe TA; (ii) an interim report, within 4 months of TA implementation; and (iii) a final report, within \n7 months of TA implementation. The Government, ADB, and the consultants team will hold \ntripartite meetings during inception, in midterm, and on completion of the TA. Key findings and \noutputs of the TA will be disseminated through workshops and stakeholder discussions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n31.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility, (ii) provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility, and (iii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for preparing the Mekong Water Supply and \nSanitation Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe strategic framework for the Greater Mekong Subregion program (2002) envisions a well-integrated and prosperous \nMekong subregion, free of poverty and committed to protecting the environment that is vital to the subregion\u2019s future well-being. \nThe framework focuses on five development thrusts to achieve this goal: (i) strengthen infrastructure linkages through a \nmultisectoral approach, (ii) facilitate cross-border trade and investment, (iii) enhance private sector participation in development \nand improve its competitiveness, (iv) develop human resources and skill competencies, and (v) protect the environment and \npromote sustainable use of the subregion\u2019s shared natural resources. The technical assistance will prepare a project that \ncontributes to the five development thrusts, specifically sustaining the infrastructure linkages, developing human skills, and \nprotecting the environment, and therefore indirectly contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe project contributes directly to Millennium Development Goal number 7: Reduce by half the proportion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation, in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n3.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will include (i) analyzing the impact of the project on poverty reducti\nreviewing in detail the distribution of project benefits, net economic benefits, and poverty impact ratio; (iii) identifyingeffective, ef\nand equitable financing mechanisms for cost recovery, considering differential beneficiaries\u2019 contributions to capital, tariffs and\nalternatives to enable access for the poor. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nThe potential primary beneficiaries are the poor, newly arrived urban citizens.   \nThe technical assistance will include developing innovative approaches to make sure that water supply and sanitation services \nare accessible by the urban poor, through subsidized tariff levels, long-term amortization of connection fees, and involvement of \ncivic society or private sector.   \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nAccess to affordable and sustainable water supply and sanitation services. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n ", "  Appendix 2  13 \n \nAffordability may be a constraint. Water user tariffs and connection fees will be subsidized. \n \nCultural acceptance of new technologies, especially sanitation. Through a participatory approach in selecting appropriate \ntechnologies and improved awareness, cultural constraints should be mitigated. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nA stakeholder analysis will be undertaken to identify key project stakeholders in each country and, for each subproject, their \nproject-related interests, and their role in determining project feasibility and success. The stakeholders will include government \nofficials, international and bilateral agencies, nongovernment organizations, provincial and district authorities, civil society, and \nproject-affected people and communities. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, community \nmobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nBased on the stakeholder analysis, a wide range of stakeholders and beneficiaries from each country and subproject will be \nconsulted during project preparation. Workshops will be organized at inception, midterm, and final review  to disseminate \nresults and invite stakeholders to participate in joint analysis and action planning. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.

What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \n \nWomen are responsible for a variety of tasks related to water, sanitation, and hygiene in their families. Limited access to safe \nwater and hygienic conditions results in poor health, loss of productive time due to sickness, missed schooling opportunities for \nchildren, and increased medical expenditures. Women and girls are primarily responsible for collecting and storing water and \nare the worst affected by its lack. \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    Please explain \n \nIncluding woman in the decision-making process will offer the potential for gender mainstreaming. A gender analysis will be \nundertaken during the PPTA, and a gender action plan will be prepared for the ensuing project, with specific actions integrated \ninto each subproject. \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain  \n \nIII.

Introduction \n \n1.  A consulting firm will be recruited to implement the technical assistance (TA) for preparing \nthe regional Mekong Water Supply and Sanitation Project (MWSSP) and provide expertise in (i) \nurban water supply and sanitation: policy, financial and institutional performance of utilities, \nprivate sector development, and engineering; (ii) developing a strategy for raising awareness on \nsanitation and hygiene; (iii) project economic and financial analyses; (iv) poverty and social \nanalyses, including assessment of gender and ethnic groups; (v) resettlement; and (vi) the \nenvironment. \n \n2.  The consulting firm will provide 116 person-months of consulting services: 28 international \nand 88 national. The tentative breakdown (person-months in parentheses) is as follows: team \nleader/water supply expert:  international (7); deputy team leader/water supply expert: national \n(18); sanitation expert: international (7), national (18); social development expert: international   \n(3),  national (7); resettlement expert; international (3), national (10); environmental expert; \ninternational (3),  national (14); economic expert; international (2),  national (7); and financial \nexpert: international (3),  national (14). \n \n3.  One consultant may cover more than one field of expertise. All international consultants \nshould  have  relevant  regional  experience.  One  of  the  international  consultants,  besides \nproviding technical expertise, will also act as team leader.  \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n \n4.  The  MWSSP  will  be  developed  following  a  consultative  process,  in  accordance  with \nrelevant  national  legal  requirements  and  standards,  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nrequirements, policies, and guidelines. \n \n5.  As the TA impact, the urban population of nine secondary towns in the economic corridors \n(EC) in Viet Nam, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Cambodia (the \u201cthree \ngovernments\u201d) will be using sustainable and improved water supply and sanitation facilities, and \nadopting  safer  hygienic  practices.  The  towns  are  Stung  Treng  and  Kratie  in  Cambodia; \nXaibouili, Phalanxai, and Khinark in Lao PDR; and Dong Ha, Quang Tri, Lao Bao, and Cua Viet \nin Viet Nam. \n \n6.  The outcome of the TA is an agreed-upon grant sector project, designed to (i) construct \nfacilities to supply continuous and safe water to 200,000 people in the nine secondary towns; (ii) \ndevelop and adopt for each  town a sanitation strategy covering short-term and long-term \nactions; (iii) implement the short-term sanitation action plan, including construction of related \ninfrastructure, in the nine towns; (iv) ensure affordable and sustainable access of the poor urban \npopulation to WSS services; and (v) strengthen the institutional, technical, and financial capacity \nof public and private sector operators in providing WSS services. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n7.  The outputs of the TA are the following: \n \n(i)  agreement on the level of water supply services for each town; \n ", "  Appendix 4  17 \n(ii)  understanding  by  government  and  utility  staff  of  the  policy  and  practices  of \nsetting user charges; \n(iii)  approved  long-term  sanitation  strategy  for  each  town,  including  a  short-term \ninvestment plan developed; \n(iv)  endorsed capacity building plan for public utilities; \n(v)  endorsed capacity building plan for the private sector; and \n(vi)  agreed-upon overall investment project. \n \n8.  Output 1: Agreement on the Level of Water Supply Services for Each Town. Most \nwater supply investment projects are not able to achieve the objective of supplying potable \nwater 24 hours a day at constant pressure.  \n \n9.  The TA should recommend alternative scenarios, such as phased improvement of the \nservice level, combined with incremental service fee increases, considering technical, financial, \ninstitutional,  and  legal  constraints.  Through  multicriteria  analysis,  the  optimum  short-term \napproach for each town needs to be discussed and selected, including, but not limited to, (i) full \ntreatment of potable water; and (ii) partial treatment of clean water (suitable for washing, bathing, \nhousehold disinfection, and boiling) complemented by disinfection of water at home or purchase \nof bottled water.  \n \n10.  Evaluation and recommendations need to be presented in a feasibility report, completed \nby month 3 of TA implementation, and during a midterm workshop.  \n  \n11.  Output  2:  Understanding  by  Government  and  Utility  Staff  of  the  Policy  and \nPractices of Setting User Charges. The staff and management of water companies do not \nalways correctly understand the principles of setting charges, and connection and user fees. \nThus, they find it difficult to justify to decision makers their proposed fee and tariff structures. \nLikewise, decision makers often lack the knowledge to fully appreciate the justification.  Utilities \nshould develop innovative approaches to make sure that basic services such as subsidized tariff \nlevels and long-term amortization of connection fees are accessible to the urban poor. \n \n12.  The  TA  is  expected  to  improve  knowledge  on  tariff-setting  policies,  principles,  and \npractices to achieve agreements on cost recovery levels and improve the financial sustainability \nof the utilities. The consultants will need to identified relevant utility staff and decision makers \nand assess their knowledge level. Different principles and practices related to connection and \nuser fees need to be identified, evaluated, and discussed with country-level utility staff and \ndecision makers. Recommendations on the most appropriate approaches need to be formulated \nand agreed upon. \n \n13.  The  results  will  be  presented  and  discussed  during  a  3-day  regional  workshop, \ncombined  with  a  midterm  workshop,  to  be  attended  by  30  staff  drawn  from  the  three \ngovernments and utility staff. Workshop proceedings will be included in the midterm report. \n \n14.  Output 3: Approved Long-Term Sanitation Strategy for Each Town, Including a \nShort-Term Investment Plan. Except in cases where flooding leads to visible obstruction for \nhuman  or  motorized  traffic,  and  despite  the  increased  prevalence  of  dengue,  few  local \ngovernments consider sanitation, including drainage, as a main priority for their developing \ntowns. To solve current problems and anticipate future ones, a sanitation strategy should be \ndeveloped and adopted after determining the current sanitation status and the desired status; \nidentifying least-cost technologies, required investments, financing sources, implementation and \n ", "18  Appendix 4 \n \noperation arrangements, role and capacity of the private sector, and role and responsibility of \ncivic society and communities. \n \n15.  The TA will develop a sanitation strategy for each town, covering on-site sanitation, \nsewerage discharge and treatment, and drainage. It should have an issue-based, dynamic \nframework for 5-year investment plans, to be reviewed and updated every 2\u22123 years. The \nstrategic  plan  should  identify  development  issues,  relevant  parameters,  and  monitoring \nmechanisms  required  to  update  the  plan,  such  as  demographic  development,  planned \ngovernment  investments,  private  investments,  etc.  Attached  to  the  strategy  is  a  hygiene \neducational program and investment plan to be implemented under the project.  \n \n16.  The draft strategies will be discussed during the midterm review and presented at the \nmidterm workshop. Final strategies will be included in the final report. \n \n17.  Output 4: Endorsed Capacity-Building Plan for Public Utilities. Many investments in \nthe WSS sector are not sustainable, since public utilities suffer from lack of financial and human \ncapacity resources and skills to effectively and efficiently operate the WSS infrastructure.  \n \n18.  The TA will develop a plan for building public sector capacity for each town, endorsed by \nlocal  governments.  The  plan  will  identify  required  resources  and  methodology  to  enhance \nfinancial, institutional, and human resource capacities at government and utility level to sustain \nWSS services.  \n \n19.  The  draft  plans  will  be  discussed  during  the  midterm  review  and  presented  at  the \nmidterm workshop. Final plans will be included in the final report. \n \n20.  Output 5: Endorsed Capacity Building Plan for the Private Sector. Small informal \noperators are active in the three project countries; in some cases, formal local and international \noperators have entered into service and management contracts, but mainly in the larger cities. \nThe three governments recognize that (i) the private sector must be involved in  providing \ndrinking water, (ii) the presence of a sound regulatory framework is a precondition for more \nformal private sector investment, and (iii) support to small operators is essential in further \nexpanding services in small and secondary towns. \n \n21.  The TA will develop for each country a plan for building private sector capacity in \nproviding WSS services. The plan must be endorsed by the governments and must identify \nrequired resources and methodology to enhance technical and management capacity. \n \n22.  The draft plans will be discussed during the midterm review and presented during the \nmidterm workshop. The final plans will be included in the final report. \n \n23.  Output 6: Agreed-Upon Overall Investment Project. The final report should have \npreliminary designs of infrastructure to be financed under the project, detailed cost estimates, \nfinancial and economic evaluations, plans for building the capacity to implement the project, \ndetailed project implementation and phasing schedules for each subproject, contract package, \nand a system for monitoring project performance. The preliminary designs should follow Viet \nNam\u2019s guidelines for preparing feasibility studies.1 \n \n                                                 \n1  Ha Noi. 2008.
