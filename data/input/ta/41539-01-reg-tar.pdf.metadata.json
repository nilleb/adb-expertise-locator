In February 1998 in the wake of the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crises, the finance \nministers  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  met  in  Jakarta.  They \ndiscussed the concept of an ASEAN economic surveillance process. In an attempt to strengthen \nthe capacity of national and regional institutions engaged in regional economic review and \npolicy dialogue, they asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance \n(TA) to support the ASEAN surveillance process. ADB responded with a two-part capacity building \neffort: (i) support for establishment of national surveillance units in selected ASEAN countries, \nand (ii) provision of training on regional economic and financial monitoring for officers from \nfinance  ministries  and  central  banks  of  selected  ASEAN+3  countries1  and  the  ASEAN \nSecretariat.  \n2.  Since 1998, ADB has organized training programs that have evolved to the current \ncourse  on  regional  economic  and  financial  monitoring  (REFM).  Five  TAs  financed  these \nprograms2  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  ASEAN+3  countries  in  economic  and  financial \nmonitoring\u2014299 mid-level government officials have completed REFM training. Many of these \nofficials are now leading the design and implementation of national and regional surveillance in \ntheir respective countries and are actively involved in vulnerability assessment and economic \npolicy formulation.  \n3.  Given the remarkable performance and effectiveness of the training program, several \nASEAN+3 countries and countries outside the region have asked ADB to support technical \ntraining on REFM. In particular, confronted by the unprecedented global financial crisis, several \nADB member countries and international organizations have argued the need to provide more \ncountries beyond ASEAN+3 with benefits of the surveillance-related training program. This is to \nstrengthen the institutional and technical capacity of their officials for economic and financial \nmonitoring,  and  build  capacity  to  formulate  effective  economic  policies  through  enhanced \nregional cooperation.3 This TA is designed to respond to these requests by bringing together \nthe strengths identified in previous TAs. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  ASEAN+3  Finance  Ministers'  Process  launched  several  initiatives  aimed  at \nenhancing domestic and regional economic and financial cooperation, which include the Chiang \nMai  Initiative,  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative,  Economic  Review  and  Policy  Dialogue,  and \n                                                 \n1  Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  People's  Republic  of  China,  Indonesia,  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic, \nMalaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  Previous TA projects include ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance for Technical Training and Capacity Building in \nSupport of the ASEAN Economic Surveillance Process. Manila (TA 5827-REG); ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance \nfor Technical Training and Capacity Building in Support of the ASEAN Economic Surveillance Process, Phase II. \nManila (TA 6019-REG); Technical Assistance for Technical Training and Capacity Building in Support of the \nASEAN Economic Surveillance Process, Phase III. Manila (TA 6071-REG); ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for \nTechnical Training and Capacity Building in Support of the ASEAN Economic Surveillance Process, Phase IV. \nManila  (TA  6201-REG);  and  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Training  and  Capacity  Building  for  Selected  ASEAN+3 \nCountries on Regional Economic and Financial Monitoring. Manila (TA 6342-REG). \n3  In a meeting with Sri Lanka Central Bank officials during an ADB Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) \nseminar, OREI was asked to organize a training course on REFM for finance ministry and central bank officials of \nSouth Asian countries in collaboration with the Central Bank Centre for Banking Studies. Sri Lanka is the current \nchair of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \n4  The TA concept paper was approved on 15 October 2009. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB's website on 19 November 2009. \n ", "2   \nASEAN+3 Research Group. In addition, a working group on economic and financial surveillance \nwas created during the May 2006 meeting of the ASEAN+3 finance ministers in Hyderabad, \nIndia.  Staff  of  finance  ministries  and  central  banks  of  these  countries  are  involved  in  the \ninitiatives. Continued support and strengthening of capacity development assistance for these \nofficials on regional economic surveillance is essential to ensure success of activities initiated \nunder the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers' Process.  \n \n5.  The TA takes into account agreements made during the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers' \nMeeting in Bali in May 2009, on the establishment of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research \nOffice. The office is an independent regional surveillance unit to monitor and analyze regional \neconomies  and  to  support  decision  making  on  the  Chiang  Mai  Initiative  Multilateralization \n(CMIM)5. For the Macroeconomic Research Office to achieve its expected outcome, continuous \nefforts are needed to enhance the surveillance capacity of ASEAN+3 officials. The REFM \ntraining program is designed to support these capacity building efforts and this would, in the \nlong term, lay the groundwork for stronger regional surveillance potential in relation to recent \nCMIM development. \n \n6.  While economic monitoring should adopt a multilateral perspective as well as country-\nspecific circumstances, surveillance needs to evolve with the changing environment of the \nglobal  economy.  For  instance,  the  recent  global  financial  crisis  showed  that  the  existing \nframework of financial regulation and supervision (i.e., the microprudential framework) tends to \nprimarily  focus  on  the  stability  of  individual  institutions,  markets,  and  infrastructure,  while \nunderestimating systemic risks. On the other hand, the macroprudential approach to supervision \nmainly focuses on the financial system as a whole and involves monitoring, assessment, and \nmitigation of systemic risk, namely the likelihood of failure of a significant part of the financial \nsystem.  In  this  context,  analytical  tools  for  integrating  financial  sector  and  capital  market \nanalysis into macroeconomic assessments need to be developed to tackle financial sector \nissues arising from the recent global financial and economic meltdown, which is unmatched in \nthe postwar era. \n \n7.  To address these issues, the TA incorporates two fundamental changes in terms of the \ngeographic coverage of recipient countries and the focus of the training program. First, the scope \nof assistance will be expanded beyond ASEAN+3 to cover South Asian countries,6 which are \nincreasingly vulnerable to changes in the external economic environment caused by incremental \nopenness.  Second,  confronting  the  widespread  impact  of  the  unprecedented  financial  and \neconomic shock, the TA will also address postcrisis surveillance issues ranging from capital \nliberalization, financial regulation, and macroprudential framework7\u2014with a view to exploring \ntheir implications for the regional surveillance mechanism. \n                                                 \n5  The CMIM is a reserve pooling arrangement that member economies could tap to help prevent a currency crisis. If \nan agreement on the CMIM is reached, a sound decision making process regarding the provision of funds (to \naffected countries) in a potential crisis will need to be put in place. \n6  Starting in 2010, in addition to the existing ASEAN+3 countries, the training program will invite selected developing \nmember countries from South Asia. In this connection, during 14\u201318 Sep 2009, OREI provided 38 participants from \neight South Asian countries with a short version of the REFM training workshop In Sri Lanka. The course was \nmodeled on ADB's regular 4-week REFM course but adapted with a regional focus on South Asia as part of the \nresponse to requests by South Asian countries and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \nSecretariat for increased capacity-building on regional economic and financial monitoring in this region. The TA is a \nresponse to their request for a follow-up program with emphasis on more advanced vulnerability assessment tools. \n7  Macroprudential analysis is used in vulnerability assessment as a way to quantify and qualify the soundness and \nvulnerability of financial systems using macroeconomic data, financial soundness indicators, and information on the \nstructure of the financial system and the institutional and regulatory framework (V. Sundararajan et al. 2002. \nFinancial  Soundness  Indicators:  Analytical  Aspects  and  Country  Practices.  IMF  Occasional  Paper.  No.  22. \nWashington, DC: International Monetary Fund). ", "3   \n \n \n8.  The number of participants per workshop will more than double from about 20 to about 40 \ndue to the expanded geographic coverage of the training course. The format of the program will \nbe revised to improve the effectiveness of the course. Each subregion fundamentally faces a \ngreat diversity in terms of economic development, openness, trade, and financial market maturity. \nThus, the lecture contents provided for participants and its program format will be customized to \nspecific needs depending on subregional background. Lastly, the lack of high-frequency data in \nsome countries is expected to make undertaking appropriate economic and statistical analyses \nrequired for surveillance work difficult. These issues need to be discussed with the participating \ncountries to ensure that the benefits of the program are maximized. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA has four main objectives: (i) to build the capacity of officials from finance \nministries  and  central  banks  of  developing  member  countries  in  economic  and  financial \nsurveillance;  (ii)  to  provide  relevant  inputs  for  economic  policy-making  activities  through \ntechnical training programs and research; (iii) to prepare for the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic \nResearch Office\u2019s expected role by promoting surveillance expertise built on shared principles \nand  techniques  across  the  region;  (iv)  to  modernize  national  surveillance  units  in  ASEAN \ncountries  through  an  intensive  case  study  methodology  to  examine  their  unique  economic \ncircumstances and explore their decade-long achievement and regional approach to economic \nsurveillance. \n \n10.  The overall impact of the TA will be improved capacity for REFM surveillance and \nmacroeconomic policy formulation for staff, up to mid-level officials, of finance ministries and \ncentral banks. In the long-run, this will lay the foundation for strengthened regional surveillance \nthat  should  help  the  effective  management  of  the  CMIM.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  support \nestablishment of an extensive alumni network with members that have identical principles and are \nknowledgeable in a wide range of topics such as economic and financial data systems, the early \nwarning system (EWS) model, methods of economic policy analysis, and international standards \nin financial regulation and macroprudential frameworks. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The REFM technical course will involve about 100\u2013120 mid-level staff from finance \nministries and central banks through 3\u20134 batches of semiannual education programs. This is \nsubject to the number of participating countries in the region and the venue for the training. The \ncourse  will  primarily  focus  on  financial  programming,  develop  capacity  to  assess  financial \nvulnerability, and conduct economic and financial analysis using EWS models. \n \n12.  The course will be divided into four parts. Part I will introduce the course and discuss \nsurveillance  issues  in  the  context  of  the  theory  and  practice  of  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration. Trainees will provide briefings on recent economic trends in their countries and \nrecommend responses to them in terms of policy development. Part II will deal with issues \nrelated to macroeconomic financial programming and economic policies, with simulations of \nprogram scenarios. This will include a review of different macroeconomic and financial accounts, \nand formulation of macroeconomic polices. Part III will cover financial vulnerability assessments \nand leading indicators in detail. The experiences of a couple of countries with economic and \nfinancial surveillance will also be discussed, particularly in terms of its role and effectiveness in \n ", "4   \nthe midst of the recent global economic and financial crisis. Part IV will introduce and analyze \nEWS models, including the vulnerability indicators and early warning systems (VIEWS) model \ndeveloped by ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI). This part will also address \nselected timely topics related to regional cooperation and integration and economic surveillance, \nsuch as global payments imbalances and postcrisis surveillance issues ranging from financial \nregulation to macroprudential framework. This will provide trainees with an opportunity to explore \nimplications of the regional surveillance mechanism. ADB staff and consultants will conduct the \ncourse. Given that around 40 people from more than 15 countries with diversified economic \ndevelopment  and  financial  market  maturity  are  participating  in  the  training  program,  some \nmodules will be adjusted to factor in the subregional background so that discussions will be \nmore focused and the training program will be more manageable and productive as a whole. \n \n13.  The  mid-level  officials  who  will  attend  this  program  will  be  selected  from  finance \nministries and central banks of countries in the region. Participants are expected to have the \nfollowing minimum qualifications: \n \n(i)  a bachelor's degree (or the equivalent) in economics, statistics, or finance from a \nrecognized university, and preferably a postgraduate qualification in the same \nfield; \n(ii)  at  least  5  years  of  relevant  professional  work  experience,  with  a  strong \nbackground in economic and statistical analysis; \n(iii)  knowledgeable in MS Excel and preferably Eviews, and \n(iv)  currently working or expected to work in a department undertaking surveillance \nwork. \n \n14.  A case study involving a couple of countries where surveillance units were established \nin the aftermath of the 1997\u201398 Asian financial crisis would be a good resource for use in the \ncourse. It will provide participants with valuable lessons and implications for a good case study \nmodel that could be used to take an in-depth look at the effectiveness of surveillance units in the \nmidst of the recent economic and financial turmoil. In this context, a case study or research on \nregional economic surveillance and macroeconomic policy formulation for selected countries in \nEast Asia will be done, in addition to the course on REFM. This will be conducted by ADB staff \nand international consultants. The research outcome will be presented to course participants \nand disseminated to the public, as appropriate, so that the findings from these case studies can \nbe adapted to the specific circumstances of selected economies in Asia. \n \n15.  The REFM workshops will expose trainees to economic and financial data systems; \nemerging data standards; EWS and macroeconomic models; methods of policy analysis and \nformulation; how to achieve financial stability; and implications of monetary, exchange rate, and \nfiscal policies. These activities will help develop the technical skills and practical experience \nneeded to sustain and support full understanding and ownership of issues related to REFM. \nAlthough  participation  in  this  training  program  will  be  open  to  most  developing  member \ncountries, some countries are expected to participate to a higher degree. Since the capacity to \nconduct economic and financial monitoring in South Asian countries lags far behind ASEAN+3 \ncountries, more mid-level officials from these countries will be encouraged  to participate in this TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,300,000,  of  which  the  equivalent  of \n$1,200,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund ", "5   \n \n(TASF-IV for $1,000,000 and TASF\u2013other sources for $200,000). The ASEAN Secretariat and \ngovernments  of  participating  developing  member  countries  will  provide  in-kind  counterpart \nsupport, including salaries of participating staff from government agencies for the duration of the \ntraining program, estimated at $100,000. The detailed cost breakdown and proposed financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented in close \ncollaboration with the ASEAN Secretariat, participating countries' finance ministries and central \nbanks, ADB regional departments, and other regional institutions, if available. ADB may also \ncollaborate with an international organization to help organize the workshops held outside \nManila. Participants in the course will closely coordinate with OREI and host countries during \nthe training. The TA will be carried out from January 2010 to the expected completion date of \nJuly 2011. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.8 \n \n18.  All consultants will be hired as individual consultants and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of \nreference  for  the  consultants  and  resource  persons  are  in  Appendix  3.  Three  national \nconsultants will (i) coordinate the planning and implementation of the REFM course; (ii) facilitate \nlogistical arrangements, including day-to-day assistance to the trainees; (iii) help with project \nadministration;  and  (iv)  provide  research  assistance  if  needed.  About  6\u20139  international \nconsultants will be hired to help deliver lectures on REFM. They should have solid experience in \nmacroeconomics and financial programming, including experience in teaching these and related \nsubjects to government officials. Two to three economists will be contracted to complete a case \nstudy on economic and financial surveillance and macroeconomic policy formulation. National \nconsultants will be engaged for 28 person-months total and international consultants for 15 \nperson-months total. Ten to twelve resource people will be invited to speak on different special \ntopics  or  current  issues  on  regional  cooperation  and  integration  as  well  as  statistics  and \neconometrics.  To  successfully  implement  this  TA,  a  team  of  OREI  staff  including  one \nprofessional staff member, one national officer, and one operations assistant, will consolidate \nconsultants' individual outputs, and coordinate and administer individual consultant contracts.  \n \n19.  For  this  course,  ADB  will  provide  round-trip  economy  airfare,  per  diem,  hotel \naccommodation, and miscellaneous travel expenses for the trainees, plus training material and \nlogistics. Participation in all TA activities will be on a voluntary basis. During the training, the \ntrainees' salaries will continue to be met by their respective governments. Trainees will not be \nemployees of ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Technical  Training  and  Capacity  Building  for  Selected  Asian  Countries  on  Regional \nEconomic  and  Financial  Monitoring,  and  hereby  reports  this  action  to  the  Board.\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.
