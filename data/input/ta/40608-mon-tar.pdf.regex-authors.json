INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2006 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Mongolia requested \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to support the strengthening of the \npension system. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Ulaanbaatar from 6 to 17 November 2006 to \ndiscuss with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MSWL), and \nother relevant agencies the impact, outcome, outputs, inputs, cost and financing arrangements, \nterms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The state pension system falls under the Social Insurance Law of 1994 and is one of five \nmajor  programs  in  social  insurance.  MSWL  is  mainly  responsible  for  formulating  pension \npolicies and the State Social Insurance General Office (SSIGO), an organization established \nunder  MSWL,  is  responsible  for  implementing  the  pension  scheme  including  collection  of \npremiums and payment of benefits. The pension fund and other state funds are not independent \nfrom the treasury function and MOF is responsible for managing these funds. However, public \nsector  employees,  private  sector  employees,  and  the  self-employed  including  herders  are \nsubject to different pension schemes, and the fund is managed on an aggregate basis. \n \n3.  The  pension  system  currently  operates  on  a  pay-as-you-go  basis  with  each  year\u2019s \ncontribution income used to finance that year\u2019s benefit payments. The pension fund  currently \nhas an annual deficit of about MNT44.4 billion (approximately $37.7 million) and projections \nshow that the deficit is likely to grow in the near future since the growth rate of benefit payments \nis exceeding the growth rate of collected pension premiums. Legislation adopted in 1999 set out \na different way of computing pensions for workers born after 1960. With this new approach, the \namount that each individual contributes toward his/her pension is notionally accumulated for \nhim/her in his/her own retirement account. At retirement, the individual receives a monthly \npension equal to the balance in the individual\u2019s account divided by the individual\u2019s expected life. \nIn practice, however, each year\u2019s contribution under the new system is not accumulated and \ninvested  but  is  used  to  finance  that  year\u2019s  benefit  payments.  On  the  basis  of  preliminary \nestimations, underfunded pension obligations reached MNT200 billion, which is around 7\u20138% of \nthe gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005, and are growing at the rate of MNT40 billion\u201350 \nbillion per year. If the problem of underfunded pension obligations is not properly addressed in \nthe near future, it can have a significant negative impact on the fiscal stability of the country. \nThe initial poverty and social assessment is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  One way of improving the viability of the pension fund is to improve the collection rate, \ngiven the underreporting of wages and salaries by employers in the payment of social insurance \ncontributions.  Employers  are also treating  some  employees  as  self-employed  who  are  not \nsubject to the contribution requirements. Improvements in the collection of contributions would \nstrengthen  the  financial  status  of  the  pension  fund  without  an  increase  in  the  level  of \ncontributions, but will not be enough to deal with the problem.  \n \n5.  The category of the self-employed covers some 350,000 herders (the numbers vary) and \n130,000 self-employed in the informal economy, about 50% of Mongolia\u2019s workforce. They are \neligible to participate in the current programs on a voluntary basis, but only 4% do so. Many \npeople,  who  have  already  retired from  self-employment  or  herding are  entitled  to  pension \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 December 2006. \n ", "2 \nbenefits (usually the minimum pension) on the basis of work prior to the transition to the market \neconomy. Those retiring in the future are unlikely to have enough coverage to qualify for any \npension  under  social  insurance.  The  Government  aims  to  provide  adequate  protection  to \nherders and other self-employed people through a separate contributory pension scheme with a \nsubsidy structured in such a way that the largest subsidy goes to those with the least ability to \nmake contributions, since the voluntary program has not worked.  \n \n6.  The current pension benefit policies should also be reviewed to ensure the sustainability \nof the system. The practice of early retirement has been prevailing and the ratio of pensioners to \nthe population above 60 years is close to 2. The average replacement rate stands at 65% of \naverage wage, which represents almost 100% replacement as pension benefits are not taxed. A \nwhite  paper  on  pension  system  reform  prepared  by  MSWL  under  ADB  Loan  2010-MON2 \nproposed raising the age when one becomes eligible for pension benefits on a gender-neutral \nbasis.  \n \n7.  The pension fund needs to be restructured and reestablished as an independent agency \nto function as a defined contribution system, for, in the past, the pension system has sometimes \nbeen exploited as a financing vehicle for fiscal deficits. If the independence of the pension fund \nis ensured, then at the next stage appropriate amendments should be introduced in legislation \nto allow the fund to engage in investment activities. The expected development of mortgage-\nbacked  securities  markets  will  expand  the  investment  opportunities  for  the  pension  fund. \nRecently,  commercial  banks  and the  Bank  of Mongolia (BOM,  the  country\u2019s  central  bank) \nagreed to establish the Housing Finance Corporation (HFC). HFC is expected to function as a \nvehicle to enable commercial banks to transfer the risk of long-term housing loans by issuing \nmortgage-backed  securities.  The  pension  fund  needs  to  diversify  its  investment,  including \ninvesting  in  other  financial  products  such  as  corporate  shares,  corporate  bonds,  and \ngovernment  bonds.  There  is  a  need  for  sound  investment  policies  and  guidelines  for  the \npension fund. \n \n8.  The restructuring of the pension fund and its engagement in investment activities will, in \nturn, promote the development of capital markets. Currently, lack of institutional investors is one \nof the major constraints to the development of capital markets. If the pension fund emerges as a \nmajor institutional investor in the capital markets, it will substantially increase the capacity of the \nmarket  to  absorb  new  issuance  of  securities  and  help  improve  corporate  governance  of \nsecurities issuers.  \n \n9.  MSWL is now drafting a law to increase the collection rate, expand the coverage of the \npension system, raise the retirement age, and allow the pension fund to invest in financial \nproducts. The draft law is being developed on the basis of recommendations made under Loan \n2010-MON and the broad strategy for the social security sector developed under Loan 1836-\nMON.3 The draft law is expected to be submitted to parliament during the spring session of 2007. \nThe  implementation  of  the  law  being  drafted  is  expected  to  contribute  to  improving  the \nsustainability of the pension system. As a long-term goal, the Government is envisaging the \ndevelopment of the pension system into a three-pillar system: (i) the first pillar as a basic \npension  for  maintaining  basic  life,  (ii)  the  second  pillar  in  proportion  with  the  salary  and \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

The proposed TA for strengthening the pension system is in line with the 2006\u20132008 \ncountry  strategy  and  program  (CSP).  The  CSP  has  indicated  that  the  lack  of  appropriate \nfinancial  instruments  increases  the  susceptibility  of  the  aged  to  poverty.  The  policy \nrecommendations under the proposed TA will be developed on the basis of the achievements \nunder ADB\u2019s previous activities to ensure consistency in approach. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  An adequate, affordable, self-sustaining, and operationally effective restructured pension \nsystem will  be  the  expected  impact  of  the  TA.  The  outcome  will  be  the adoption  by  the \nGovernment of the proposed recommendations on pension reforms. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will review the current pension policies and practices and existing plans for \npension reforms, identify merits and shortcomings of the current system and existing plans, and \nrecommend a strategy for further pension reforms. Key activities will include \n \n(i)  reviewing current policies and practices on pension contributions and benefit \npayments and operations of the pension system; \n(ii)  reviewing the progress of pilot programs to extend the coverage to the self-\nemployed and herders; \n(iii)  assessing  the  affordability  to  existing  and  potential  contributors  of  pension \npremiums and necessary amounts for meeting the basic needs of retirees; \n(iv)  reviewing MSWL\u2019s plans for pension reforms reflected in the draft law from the \nviewpoint of adequacy, affordability, self-sustainability, and operational efficiency; \n(v)  reviewing  enforcement  measures  for  collection  and  SSIGO\u2019s  practices  and \ninstitutional capacities in premiums collection and personal account management; \n(vi)  reviewing experiences in other countries in moving from a pay-as-you-go system \nto a notional defined contribution system, and in the development of a three-pillar \npension system in selected other countries to extract lessons and identify models; \n(vii)  proposing a strategy to further reform the pension system including measures to \n(a)  improve  financial  sustainability  of  the  pension  system  while  taking  into \naccount  its  affordability  to  pension  contributors  and  pensioners,  (b)  further \nincrease the collection ratio in the private sector, (c) further expand coverage of \nthe pension system, and (d) improve operational efficiencies and effectiveness;  \n(viii)  assessing the impacts, both positive and negative, of the pension reforms on  \nvulnerable people; \n(ix)  proposing a road map to develop a three-pillar pension system; and \n(x)  identifying further needed external assistance to implement the strategy to further \nreform the pension system.  \n \n13.  The TA will also review the potential of financial products as investment tools and \nprovide guidance on the investment and management of pension funds. Key activities will \ninclude  \n ", "4 \n(i)  assessing current market conditions and the potential for the development of  \nmarkets of various financial products;  \n(ii)  reviewing legal and regulatory environment and other infrastructure for the above \nfinancial  products  and  identifying  impediments  to  the  development  of  these \nfinancial products; \n(iii)  reviewing capacities of staffs and institutions in charge of managing pension \nfunds and other state funds, and of the private sector; and \n(iv)  recommending policies and guidelines on investment and portfolio management \nfor restructured pension funds. \n \n14.  The TA will provide legal assistance to implement the recommended pension reforms \nand to facilitate the investment and management activities of the pension fund. Key activities will \ninclude, but will not be limited to, \n  \n(i)  reviewing  existing  legislation  and  regulations  governing  pension  policies  and \noperations and MSWL\u2019s draft amendments to the laws; \n(ii)  reviewing  legislation  and  regulations  that  may  affect  the  pension  fund\u2019s \noperations and investment activities after restructuring; and \n(iii)  drafting legal amendments to implement the further reform strategy and facilitate \nthe investment activities of the pension fund. \n \n15.  The TA will also support activities to increase public awareness of the benefits of the \npension system and the importance of pension reforms. Workshops and conferences will be \norganized to disseminate the project\u2019s findings and recommendations and lessons from the \nexperience in other countries to various stakeholders and invite comments from them. The TA \nwill also conduct training activities for operational staff on measures to improve efficiency, for \nfund management staff of the pension fund and other institutional investors on investment \npolicies and portfolio management, and for actuarial practitioners on actuarial calculation. A \nshort-term study tour for key government officials will be organized to learn from the experience \nin pension reforms in another country, which can be a model for Mongolia\u2019s pension reforms.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $770,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $650,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis with \n$150,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  and  $500,000  equivalent  from  the \nGovernment of Luxembourg, to be administered by ADB. The Government of Mongolia will \nfinance  the  remaining  $120,000  local  currency  equivalent  in  kind,  to  cover  office \naccommodation, counterpart staff, and other related services. Detailed cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.   MOF is the Executing Agency for the TA. MSWL and SSIGO are the implementing \nagencies.  MOF,  MSWL,  SSIGO,  the  Financial  Regulatory  Commission,  BOM,  and  the \nMongolian Stock Exchange will form a coordination committee led by the Director General of the \nFinancial Policy and Coordination Department of MOF for effective coordination in implementing \nthe TA. A project implementation team comprising counterpart staff from MOF and MSWL will \nbe established for daily implementation and monitoring of the project and communication with \nthe consultant team. MOF and MSWL will provide the necessary office space and other related \nservices to the consultants.  ", "5 \n \n18.
