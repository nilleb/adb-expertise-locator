THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) cluster is designed to complement the \nproposed  loan  of  up  to  $100,000,000  to  Olam  International  Limited  (OIL)  and  two  of  its \nsubsidiaries. The loan will support the $223,000,000 capex and expansion plan of OIL and its \nsubsidiaries (Olam) over the 2017-2019 period and invest in Olam\u2019s midstream processing assets \nand permanent working capital for smallholder farmer supply in Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua \nNew Guinea (PNG), and Viet Nam.1 The project will promote inclusive and sustainable agricultural \nvalue chains with higher local value addition in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The TA subproject \nwill complement the loan by providing capacity building support to 6,500 smallholder coffee \nfarmers that Olam sources from in Timor-Leste.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n2.  The TA cluster was approved on 18 December 2017. The TA cluster will be implemented \nover 3.5 years, from December 2017 to September 2021, with start dates and duration for each \nsubproject indicated in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nItem  Subproject Title  Implementation Period  Budget \nSubproject 1  Indonesia   December 2017\u2013September 2020  $750,000 \nSubproject 2  Timor-Leste  April 2018\u2013September 2020  $1,200,000 \nSubproject 3  Viet Nam  October 2018\u2013March 2020  $750,000 \nSubproject 4  Papua New Guinea  April 2019\u2013September 2021  $300,000 \nSources: Olam; Asian Development Bank. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope \n \n3.  The TA subproject will help smallholder coffee farmers in Timor-Leste fully benefit from \ntheir inclusion in the coffee value chain by improving the productivity and quality of crops, and \nmeeting international certification standards. The subproject will also ensure that these farmers \nare better prepared to cope with the negative consequences of climate change. The scope of the \nTA subproject will be limited to the activities of the TA cluster in Timor-Leste.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Impacts and outcome of the TA subproject are in line with the financing project. Impacts \nare: (i) double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through \ninputs, knowledge, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment, (ii) \nensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that \nincrease productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for \nadaptation to climate change, and (iii) significant increase in the exports of developing countries. \nThe major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n \n \n \n1  In order of start dates (see Table 1). \n ", "2   \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities \n1.

Subproject Cost and Financing \n \n5.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $1,200,000 of which $1,040,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6) and $160,000, for the \ncomponents related to climate change adaptation, will be financed by the Canadian Climate Fund \nfor  the  Private  Sector  in  Asia  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and \nadministered by ADB.  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n6.  ADB will administer the TA subproject from April 2018 to September 2020. Olam will be \nthe recipient of the TA subproject as Olam is best positioned to coordinate the work of the \nconsulting firms and share learning with farmers, the government, and other stakeholders in the \nproject countries. Because of Olam sources from the smallholder farmers directly or through local \nbuying agents, the company has a relationship with farmers and will ensure that they fully benefit \n ", "  3 \n \nfrom the TA subproject. The interests of Olam and the farmers are aligned in relation to the TA \nsubproject outcome, since if smallholder coffee farmers grow more, at a better quality, Olam \ncontinues to satisfy customer demand for high-quality, sustainable products. Olam has the \nfinancial  and  administrative  capacity  to  provide  the  required  in-kind  contributions  to  the \nconsultants and ensure successful implementation of the TA subproject.  \n \n7.  Olam  and  ADB  have  agreed  to the  terms of a  draft  TA  subproject  implementation \nagreement. The draft agreement sets out the outcome and outputs of the TA subproject, the \namount of financing to be provided by ADB, the terms of reference of the consulting firm to be \nappointed, the proposed budget, and a realistic implementation timetable. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  April 2018\u2013September 2020 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  Olam \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm:  Inclusive and Climate  Quality and Cost- $1,200,000 \nResilient Coffee Value Chain         Based Selection \n Subproject 2: Timor-Leste  \nEquipment  The consulting firms will be in charge of procuring the equipmenta required for the TA  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).

Improving \nproductivity and price realization can have a significant impact on household incomes. However, \nmany smallholder producers are constrained by gaps in knowledge and understanding of good \nagricultural practices, limited financial inclusion, difficulties in accessing high quality inputs and \ntechnical advice, poor transport links and market infrastructure, and continued dependence on \nmiddlemen.  \n \nCoffee production in Timor-Leste is de-facto organic but only around 25% of exports have the \ncertifications needed to achieve the associated price premia in consuming markets. Several \ncompanies and NGO-supported programs have established systems that ensure some degree of \ntraceability of coffees from farm-gate to export. However, most coffee exports still pass through \ntrader networks and are not traceable to the farm level. This lack of traceability is one barrier to \nincreased certification. Climate change is also a growing challenge and poses a serious threat to \nlong term sustainability. Timor-Leste is expected to experience a temperature increase of more \nthan 2.5\u00b0C on average by 2070 and is the second most vulnerable country to climate change in \nthe Pacific with economic losses expected to reach 10% of gross domestic product by 2100.3 \n \n \nThe Government of Timor-Leste has recognized the strategic importance of the coffee sector and \nis working with industry stakeholders and development partners to formulate a comprehensive \nplan for the development of the sector.4 Innovation, productivity and quality improvement, and \npartnerships between the public and private sectors are key themes of the proposed plan. The \nTA is aligned with these themes and will contribute to redevelopment of Timor-Leste\u2019s coffee \nsector by delivering a package of training and extension services to smallholder farmers that Olam \nsources from and supporting selected activities to further leverage the benefits of this training.  \n \nTA support to households will be anchored on a holistic climate-smart agriculture training program \nincluding  training  sessions,  field  trials,  and  demonstration  plots.  Productivity  and  quality \nimprovement, environmental sustainability of production, farmer organization, and household \nfinancial management will be key focus areas, which will help build suppliers\u2019 understanding of \nand adherence to the Olam Supplier Code.5 The TA will help to establish local level farmer \nmanaged demonstration plots to clearly demonstrate the impact of specific farm management \npractices.  These  demonstration  plots  will  form  part  of  a  broader  network  of  farm  level \n \n1 Government of Timor-Leste. 2016. Timor-Leste Population and Housing Census 2015.

They \nwould be comparable to the farmer demonstration plots that have been established by World \nCoffee Research and aligned with the frameworks and principles that have been established by \nthe Government of Timor-Leste and relevant industry stakeholders.  \n \nTA support to smallholders will be organized and monitored using the Olam farmer management \ninformation system (OFIS), an innovative mobile technology platform that is being developed by \nOlam. This will facilitate initial baseline data collection on household and farm characteristics, \nongoing recording of training and extension activities, periodic surveys of farm conditions to track \nchanges  over  time,  the  development  of  personalized  farm  management  plans,  and  the \nimplementation of farm and household level certifications. The deployment of OFIS will be a \nsignificant innovation for Timor-Leste and will facilitate rigorous monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nSeveral steps will be taken to maximize the benefits of the initial roll-out of OFIS. The TA will \nsupport  evaluation  of  the  relative  effectiveness  of  different  training  approaches  and \nmethodologies by using data collected through OFIS to compare the costs and benefits of two or \nmore training \u2018treatments\u2019 that have been designed with inputs from relevant experts. The TA will \nalso include specific interventions to help the Government of Timor-Leste and other industry \nstakeholders to build a clear understanding of the technology and its broad capabilities, and to \nformally assess the potential to apply OFIS or a similar system across the industry.  \n \nDelivery of TA-funded training and extension services will be closely coordinated with the Ministry \nof Agriculture and Fisheries to avoid duplication of efforts and support continued development of \nthe public extension service. The knowledge and learning that is emerging from TA activities will \nalso be regularly shared with other industry stakeholders. This will help to leverage the impact of \nTA activities by facilitating information exchange between sector stakeholders and encouraging \nbroader uptake of successful approaches.  \n \nThe TA will also encourage institution building and establishment of industry standards in Timor-\nLeste through the development of coffee grading systems and unified information management \nsystem. The TA is a piggyback TA which will help realize the projected impact of the financing \nproject. The TA will help farmers be included in the global coffee supply chain by helping them \nadopt sustainable farming practices and increasing their production and quality, and ultimately, \nincome. \nA.  Scope of Service \n \nThe project will be designed around the registration of 6,500 new farmers into the Olam Farmer \nInformation System (OFIS). This requires building on-the-gournd relationships with farmers and \ncollecting data through a baseline and annual surveys. Information collected should be used to \ndesign training programs including Good Agricultural Practices, Integrated Pest Management, \nand Climate Smart Agriculture. The setting up and running of a series of coffee demo plots will \nprovide accurate information on local coffee growing conditions, thus informing training content \nand providing training sites for farmers.  \n \nFarm level demonstration plots will be broadly modelled a World Coffee Research methodology \nbeing used locally, with the following characteristics:  \n(i)  Located on individual farmers\u2019 land and broadly representative of size / growing \nconditions faced by other farmers in the immediate vicinity;  \n(ii)  Managed according to a design that is centrally coordinated and that involves \n\u2018side-by-side\u2019 application of different treatments / practices.  \n ", "3 \n \n(iii)  Supported by careful data collection and monitoring to enable clear evaluation of \nthe economic returns of different \u2018improvements\u2019 or changes in farming practices.  \n(iv)  Providing  clear  visual  evidence  to  nearby  farmers,  and  micro-data  for  more \naggregated analysis.  \n \nOFIS will be used to generate individual farm management plans and the project will supply inputs \nand advice to implement these effectively. Improvements in productivity, coffee quality and farmer \nlivelihoods are key measures of success. (Organic) certification and/or OLC certification may be \nuseful tools for delivering/measuring these.  \n \nThe firm will report to the ADB project officer through the assignment team leader and will perform \nthe following: \n \n1.
