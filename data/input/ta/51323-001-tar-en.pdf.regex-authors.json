INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation of a \ncomprehensive master plan for two priority nodes of the Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor \n(CKIC) in the state of Tamil Nadu as agreed with the Government of India and the Government \nof  Tamil  Nadu.1 The  two  nodes  are  Thoothukudi\u2013Tirunelveli  and  Madurai\u2013Virudhunagar\u2013\nDindigul\u2013Theni. \n \n2.  The development of economic corridors such as the CKIC is consistent with the objectives \nof the country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for India, \nwhich aims to support the Government of India\u2019s goal of faster, inclusive, and sustained growth \naccompanied by rapid economic transformation and the creation of jobs.2 3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  India\u2019s manufacturing sector is crucial for job creation and economic progress, but its \ncontribution to gross domestic product (GDP) is small and is less competitive than in countries in \nEast  Asia  and  Southeast  Asia. 4  Major  constraints  to  realizing  the  full  potential  of  the \nmanufacturing sector include inadequate infrastructure that reduces India\u2019s attractiveness to \ninvestors, a cumbersome regulatory environment, and complex land acquisition procedures.5 The \ngovernment launched its Make in India initiative in September 2014 to encourage international \nfirms to invest and manufacture in India, thereby contributing to economic growth and job creation. \n \n4.  The Government of Tamil Nadu recognizes the importance of the manufacturing sector \nfor improving its economy. As India\u2019s fourth largest state, Tamil Nadu ranks among the country\u2019s \ntop performers in terms of economic prowess and several social indicators. However, from 2000 \nto 2010, the state has lost its edge in terms of economic growth and its fiscal position has \nweakened. In June 2011, the Government of Tamil Nadu identified the need to formulate a \nsuccinct strategy to rejuvenate economic growth and social development in the state to reclaim \nthe country\u2019s top position. In 2012, it unveiled Vision Tamil Nadu, 2023, a strategic plan for \ninfrastructure development, of which the manufacturing sector is envisaged to be the key driver.6 \n \n                                                \n1  In August 2017, the Government of Tamil Nadu, through the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to continue to support the master planning of the two priority nodes. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 November 2017. \n3  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2018\u20132022\u2014Accelerating Inclusive Economic Transformation. \nManila. \n4  Manufacturing accounted for 16% of India\u2019s GDP in 2016. This percentage is lower than in Malaysia, where it doubled \nfrom 10% in 1960 to 20% in 2016; Thailand, where it increased from 13% in 1960 to 27% in 2016; and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, where it stood at 31.8% in 2016. \n5  Land acquisition in India is governed by the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, \nRehabilitation, and Resettlement Act, 2013 (LARR), which came into force on 1 January 2014. One fundamental \nchange introduced under the LARR is the empowerment of farming families through the right to prior consent to land \nacquisition, which applies to land acquired for private for-profit projects and public\u2013private partnership projects. The \ngovernment retained the right of forced expropriation for projects for the public good. To some extent, the LARR also \ninjected market transactions into the process. M. Cernea. 2013.

Vision Tamil Nadu, 2023: Strategic Plan for Infrastructure Development in Tamil \nNadu. Chennai. \n ", "2 \n5.  To help fulfill the national economic policy and strategic objectives of increasing the \nmanufacturing sector\u2019s GDP share and creating jobs, the Government of India has adopted \neconomic corridor development (ECD) as a strategy to stimulate economic activities through the \nintegration of urban and industrial clusters, and to connect its manufacturing base with regional \nvalue chains and global production networks.7 Many states in India are adopting ECD to bolster \nthe manufacturing sector as a means to promote inclusive and sustainable growth.8 \n \n6.  The Government of Tamil Nadu has also adopted ECD as a policy instrument to spur \nmanufacturing growth through the development of the CKIC.9 The CKIC aligns with Vision Tamil \nNadu, 2023, with an initial focus on the state\u2019s lagging southern districts (footnote 2). At the \nnational level, the CKIC envisions port-led development under the Sagarmala project to link the \nstate\u2019s manufacturing sector with national supply chains and global value chains in East Asia and \nSoutheast Asia.10 The CKIC will provide further impetus to India\u2019s Act East Policy and promote \nregional integration with neighboring Asian economies. \n \n7.  ADB has conducted the first phase of the analytical study on the CKIC, which led to the \npreparation of a comprehensive development plan (CDP).11 The CDP identified industries that will \ndrive growth in the CKIC and the nodes in which they will be strategically located; crafted an initial \ninfrastructure development strategy; and evaluated other critical elements, including institutional \nframeworks, policies, and regulations that can create a favorable investment climate and improve \nthe ease of doing business for domestic and foreign investors. However, the CDP only broadly \ncovered the priority growth sectors and identified the target nodes as a first step. Therefore, the \nGovernment of Tamil Nadu has requested ADB to support a master plan study that will include \nthe detailed, node-specific analysis needed to initiate the implementation of the CKIC. \n \n8.  The master plan, which is the final phase of the analytical study of the CKIC, will build on \nthe CDP findings submitted to the Government of Tamil Nadu in June 2017. It will provide a \ncomprehensive review and evaluation of the CDP findings, with detailed recommendations for \ntargeted industries and subindustries, development phasing and costing of infrastructure at the \ncorridor and node levels, and an institutional framework for the management of the corridor. The \nmaster plan will identify comprehensive market potential and critical gaps of industries and \ninfrastructure in the region; analyze the financial and economic aspects of the CKIC; and identify \na regulatory and implementation framework for an enabling environment that promotes local \nindustries, creates world-class infrastructure, and attracts global investments. \n \n                                                \n7  Building infrastructure alone is not sufficient. To reinforce the Make in India initiative, the Government of India \nlaunched the Skill India program in March 2015 to establish an international-equivalent skills development framework, \ncreate workforce mobility, and enhance youth employability. In 2014, the government adopted major initiatives in line \nwith improving the business climate by simplifying and rationalizing business-related regulations and broadening the \nuse of information technology to make governance more efficient and effective. Digital India, launched in July 2015, \nintegrates government departments to promote effective governance and the accessibility of services. \n8  Economic corridors being pursued in India include the Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor, Amritsar\u2013Kolkata Industrial \nCorridor, Bengaluru\u2013Mumbai Economic Corridor, Chennai\u2013Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, and the ADB-supported \nEast Coast Economic Corridor (ECEC). \n9  ADB is India\u2019s lead partner in developing the ECEC, the first coastal corridor in India. The ECEC is being implemented \nin three phases: Phase 1 is the Vizag\u2013Chennai Industrial Corridor, which mainly covers Andhra Pradesh; Phase 2 \ncomprises the CKIC in Tamil Nadu; and Phase 3 is the corridor running through Odisha and West Bengal. \n10 The Sagarmala project envisions the concept of port-led development. It has four essential pillars: (i) reducing the \ncost of transporting domestic cargo by optimizing the modal mix, (ii) lowering logistics costs for bulk commodities by \nlocating future industrial capacities near the coast, (iii) improving export competitiveness by developing ports near \nmanufacturing clusters, and (iv) optimizing the time and cost of export\u2013import container movement. \n11 The CDP identified 63 early-bird investment projects worth \u20b9550 billion. ADB is processing three detailed project-\nreport-ready priority projects related to roads, power transmission, and the urban sector. \n ", "3 \n9.  As agreed with the Government of Tamil Nadu, inputs will be sought from potential anchor \ninvestors on the CKIC master planning process to tailor infrastructure investments and reforms \nbetter to the requirements. Industry analysis will focus on individual sectors and their potential for \nlinkages with global value chains, and will identify and actively reach out to anchor investors \nduring the initiation of master planning. The infrastructure plan12 will also rebalance supply- and \ndemand-side interventions, equip sites with infrastructure based on the specific requirements of \nanchor investors, emphasize critical urban issues such as water and flood management, highlight \nconnectivity to major gateways, and support renewable energy and plug-and-play factories13 for \ncertain industries. Strategic interventions regarding financing, governance, social impact, and \nresettlement will involve proactive investment promotion strategies, including ADB support for the \nGovernment of Tamil Nadu in designing and implementing investment promotion programs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: competitiveness of the manufacturing sector \nimproved.14 The TA will have the following outcome: a master plan used to develop the CKIC.15 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Strategic framework and policies for establishing two industrial nodes in \nthe Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor proposed. The master plan will assess the \ncomprehensive  market  potential  of  the  Thoothukudi-Tirunelveli  and  Madurai-Virudhunagar-\nDindigul-Theni nodes,16 including economic profile, industry scenario, and potential growth. It will \nalso include plans for the development of climate-resilient external and internal infrastructure for \nthe nodes in terms of transport and logistics (roads, rail, networks, and airports); energy; water; \nand sewerage. The master plan will also include a financing plan for the identified projects to give \ngovernment stakeholders information on their financing needs and to prepare a strategy for \naddressing the financing gaps. To ensure coordinated development and management of the two \nnodes, the master plan will propose institutional structures that consider the various layers of \n                                                \n12 The infrastructure plan is a subcomponent of the master plan and reflects urban, industrial, and connectivity \ninfrastructure requirements for the proposed development of the land parcels in and around the nodes. \n13 Plug-and-play (or plug-and-produce) factory technology borrows from the popular computing concept where a user \nliterally only needs to \u2018plug\u2019 in an additional device and it will start working. Similarly, the plug-and-play factories \noperate on a set parameter of communication standards and the machines are networked so that all activity is \nmonitored in real time and can be managed remotely. In this way, an additional equipment or add-on process may \nbe easily inserted in the production process as needed to improve manufacturing quality or output, unlike the \ntraditional factory which has more rigid production processes that require costly expertise to adjust even the smallest \nparameter. \n14 Make in India. http://www.makeinindia.com/home; Government of Tamil Nadu.

Based on the \nfindings of the CDP study of the CKIC, six nodes were identified: (i) Petroleum, Chemicals, and Petrochemicals \nInvestment Region at Cuddalore and Nagapattinam; (ii) Ariyalur and Perambalur; (iii) Trichy\u2013Pudukottai\u2013Sivaganga; \n(iv) Madurai\u2013Virudhunagar\u2013Dindigul\u2013Theni; (v) Ramanathapuram; and (vi) Thoothukudi\u2013Tirunelveli. GoTN has \nprioritized  Thoothukudi-Tirunelveli  and  Madurai-Virudhunagar-Dindigul-Theni nodes  for  master planning.  (see \nfootnote  1)  The  CDP  has  likewise  shortlisted  seven  industries  to  promote  a  manufacturing-led  economic \ntransformation: machinery (including special purpose), automobile and automobile components, textiles, food \nprocessing, chemicals and petrochemicals, electrical machinery, and electronics.  \n ", "4 \ngovernance from the national to the state level. These activities will produce the necessary \nframework and supporting policies to establish the two industrial nodes. \n \n12.  Output 2:  Investor  awareness  of  the  Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari  Industrial  Corridor \nnodes increased. The TA will support demand-side interventions with a focus on an investor \nneeds assessment. It will pursue continuous consultations with potential investors to identify their \nconcerns and expectations. The TA will identify potential anchor investors for the nodes early on \nand will assess the investors\u2019 land and infrastructure requirements. The TA will delineate and \ncreate a master plan for start-up areas in consideration of the requirements of key tenants.17 This \nwill help identify key industries and the factors that will influence investments in the two priority \nnodes. The TA will conduct investment promotion activities such as workshops, conferences, and \nforums that target the business community and potential investors from countries in East Asia \nand Southeast Asia to disseminate the results of the master plan.18 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.68 million, of which $1.6 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by \nADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The Government of Tamil Nadu will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA through the South Asia Department\u2019s Regional Cooperation \nand Operations Coordination Division (SARC).19 ADB will work closely with the Government of \nTamil Nadu, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, and other central and state \ngovernment agencies in implementing the TA activities. SARC will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2017\u2013May 2020 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual (individual  International expertise  $150,000 \nselection)  (18 person-months) \n  Individual (individual  National expertise  $180,000 \nselection)  (48 person-months) \n                                                \n17 The TA will give special attention to projects concerning external connectivity, energy availability, and urban \ninfrastructure to provide a better industrial environment for investors. Proper land use planning will be crucial to drive \nindustrial investment. \n18 Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu, is home to a large community from the Republic of Korea with more than \n300 companies and 5,000 people. The CKIC may help these companies partner with Indian businesses to serve the \nlocal market and reach out to export customers in neighboring markets. \n19 ADB will establish a project steering committee to provide guidance during TA implementation. It will be headed by \nthe SARC director and comprise project officers from sector divisions of the South Asia Department. SARC will \nmonitor day-to-day TA operations. \n ", "5 \n  1 consulting firm  75 person-months  $1,000,000 \n(QCBS with a 90:10  (cumulative) \nratio) \nAdvance contracting  Contract of the consulting firm \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n16.
