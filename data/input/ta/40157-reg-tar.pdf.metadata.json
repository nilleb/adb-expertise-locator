The Asian Development Bank (ADB) hosted a High-Level Coordination Meeting on \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Assistance to Tsunami-Affected Countries on 18 March 2005. \nChaired by ADB President Kuroda, the meeting brought together over 200 representatives from \ngovernments  of  the  affected  countries,  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies,  nongovernment \norganizations, and regional and international organizations. A major area of discussion was the \ntransparency and accountability in the use of the aid being provided to the affected countries. \nADB  presented  a  concept  of  a  \u201ctracking  matrix\u201d,  and  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP) presented a database format that had been used in Afghanistan. \n \n2.  In his Chair\u2019s Summary, President Kuroda stated that \u201cAs the next step, the UNDP and \nADB will collaborate in consulting concerned governments to develop a proposal for common \nsystems that will allow the aggregation of data from national systems into a regional summary \ntracking matrix. The database must capture all forms of assistance, including ODA, NGOs, and \nprivate sector support.\u201d Subsequently, a development assistance database (DAD) was designed \nby UNDP in consultation with ADB and others, and is now functioning in four of the countries \nmost affected by the tsunami\u2014Indonesia, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.1 \n \n3.  After  a  year  of  operation  funded  through  the  United  Nations  system,  the  affected \ncountries have requested assistance to strengthen and further develop the DAD system. This \nwould include building the capacity of national staff so the system is sustainable.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Each  DAD  system  was  customized  to  reflect  the  specific  needs  of  the  respective \ntsunami-affected country, and was made available online within 3 to 4 months of the High Level \nCoordination Meeting. In the 8 months since the public launch of the DAD systems in all four \ncountries, the lead government agencies and development partners have successfully tracked \nalmost 2,000 projects, with a total commitment value of $5.4 billion.2 \n \n5.  However, in all cases, the information technology infrastructure of the national host \nagency has proven insufficient to guarantee reliable and fast access. This is being addressed by \nupgrading the hardware and the speed of internet connections and, in the case of Indonesia and \nSri Lanka, moving the database servers into a private sector internet service provider. \n \n6.  In addition, the comprehensiveness and accuracy of data has been uneven across the \ncountries.  The  scale  of  reconstruction  and  number  of  funding  agencies  and  implementing \npartners in Aceh and Nias have posed particular challenges. Outreach and analysis capabilities \nin Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh-Nias are being enhanced by recruiting \nadditional national coordination officers and an aid coordination and capacity development \n                                                 \n1  The four agencies using the DAD are (i) Indonesia: Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency (BRR); (ii) Maldives: \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury, in consultation with the Ministry of Planning and National Development, and the \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs; (iii) Sri Lanka: Task Force for Assisting the Nation, now part of Reconstruction and \nDevelopment Agency; and (iv) Thailand: Thailand International Development Cooperation Agency of Ministry of \nForeign Affairs. \n2  Approximate totals as of 14 April 2006 are (i) Indonesia\u2013$2,730 million covering 920 projects; (ii) Sri Lanka\u2013 \n$2,200 million covering 600 projects; (iii) Maldives\u2013$310 million covering 90 projects; and (iv) Thailand\u2013$170 \nmillion covering 210 projects. ", "2   \nconsultant. A system of automatic e-mail notification that will alert partners and the government \nto updated project data every quarter will be introduced. \n \n7.  Such  aid  management  systems  need  to  ensure  that  the  information  is  packaged, \nanalyzed, and communicated effectively to government decision makers and the aid community. \nThe  operationalization  phase  in  each  country  necessarily  focused  on  designing  and \nimplementing the database, recruiting the national team and aid coordination consultant, and \ngathering data from partners. Some progress has been made in providing pre-packaged reports \nthrough  a  website,  but  the  analysis  and  communication  aspects  of  the  projects  require \nreinforcement.3 A regional tsunami tracking analyst has been recruited to support each national \nteam to address this challenge.  \n \n8.  In early 2006, the Governments of Indonesia, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka decided to \nexpand the DAD and use it as a tool beyond its original objective of tracking external assistance \nfor  tsunami  recovery  and  reconstruction.  This  move  will  ensure  the  sustainabililty  of  the \ninvestment in the aid management systems and teams within the institutions.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  technical  assistance4 (TA)  will  strengthen  the  transparency,  accountability,  and \nefficiency of tsunami recovery programs by helping tsunami-affected countries manage external \nassistance. Specifically, the TA will consolidate the progress in tracking tsunami aid and results, \nincrease data comprehensiveness and accuracy, and provide analytical products to help in \ndecision making and resource allocation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will support ongoing and new DAD initiatives through five main activities. \n \n(i)  Capacity  development  of  national  aid  coordination.  This  will  enable \ngovernment  agencies  to  manage  the  national  tracking  system  after  project \nclosure. The support will comprise a mix of experienced international consultants \nseconded within the government agency, along with a regional advisory team of \ntwo consultants, promoting lesson-learning and sharing of best practices across \nthe countries.  \n \n(ii)  Establishing national web portals for easy access to aid coordination data. \nThe impact of the aid management system and the data it contains will be \nenhanced significantly by pre-prepared reports and analytical products to be \nmade available at national web portals.  \n \n(iii)  Regional analysis of tsunami assistance that includes sectoral distribution, \nthrough a regional DAD mechanism. In line with the conclusion of the ADB \nHigh Level Meeting (see para. 1), analytical products drawing on the regional \n                                                 \n3  For  a  good  example  of  prepackaged  reports  see  http://www.rada.gov.lk/portal/  and  click  on  \u201cDevelopment \nAssistance Database\u201d. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 June 2006. ", "  3\nDAD  tracking  mechanism  currently  being  established  will  be  prepared  and \ndisseminated every 3 months during 2006.  \n \n(iv)  Preparation  of  lessons  learned  from  across  all  four  countries. Lessons \nlearned  by  the  national  and  regional  teams  on  planning,  implementation, \ndialogue mechanisms, and monitoring and accountability of tsunami assistance \nwill be prepared. Good aid coordination practices from tsunami-affected and \nother countries in Asia and the Pacific were collected for a knowledge sharing \nworkshop  organized  by  UNDP\u2019s  Regional  Centre  in  Bangkok  in  June  2006, \nentitled  From  Paris  to  Practice:  Tools  for  Better  Aid  Coordination  and \nManagement. The TA will provide a consultant who will contribute to the lesson-\nlearning process that will complement the good practice inputs provided at the \nworkshop  by  UNDP  country  offices,  government  counterparts,  and  other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  knowledge  products  will  contribute  to  increased \naccountability in the use of resources for recovery in the case of the tsunami, or \nin future disasters in the Asia and Pacific region. \n \n(v)  Adaptation of database to integrate budget and non-tsunami assistance. \nThis will enable Sri Lanka to use DAD Sri Lanka for non-tsunami projects and \nprovide additional outreach capacity. The Indonesian database will be modified \nto  include  domestically-funded  tsunami  projects  and  budgeted  externally \nfinanced projects, facilitating an analysis of all reconstruction support irrespective \nof  fund  source.  For  DAD  Maldives,  this  database  will  support  the  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring of the regular National Development Program, \nwhich  will  supersede  the  tsunami-centered  National  Reconstruction  and \nRecovery Program. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the project is estimated at $1,600,000. ADB will provide $800,000, \nfinanced on a grant basis through its TA funding program. UNDP will provide $800,000 on a \nparallel  basis  through  the  Regional  Project  for  Capacity  Development  for  Tsunami  Aid \nCoordination (the Regional Project). Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  UNDP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  UNDP  will  enter  into  a  letter  of \nagreement with ADB and will administer the TA funds and make all related organizational and \nadministrative arrangements according to procedures as agreed in the letter of agreement (the \ndraft letter of agreement is in Appendix 3). All equipment will be turned over to the counterpart \nagencies upon TA completion.  \n13.  UNDP\u2019s  Regional  Project 5  has  been  endorsed  by  the  four  national  counterpart \ninstitutions and provides the overall implementation framework for funding national and regional \nactivities. This is administered by UNDP\u2019s Regional Centre in Bangkok. ADB will monitor the TA \n                                                 \n5  Four country-specific databases in Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Thailand have been launched and are now \nfully operational and accessible online. These were developed in 2005 during phase I of the Regional Project. \nExperienced and coordination advisers, and additional national staff members have been recruited for secondment \ninto the government-selected apex agencies to lead the tracking and coordination work (see Appendix 3 for an \noverview of the status of implementation of the Regional Project). \n ", "4   \nactivities through regular progress reports from UNDP. ADB\u2019s resident missions and extended \nmissions will continue to be actively involved in meetings at the country level to ensure that the \nsystem responds to actual needs. \n \n14.  The implementing agencies will be the counterpart institutions responsible for tsunami \nrecovery coordination in each of the four participating countries, i.e., the Reconstruction and \nRehabilitation Agency in Indonesia, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (in cooperation with \nthe Ministry of Planning and National Development, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) in the \nMaldives, the Task Force for Assisting the Nation in Sri Lanka, and the Thailand International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency in Thailand. The TA funds will be released as specific project \nmilestones are reached, as shown in Supplementary Appendix. \n \n15.  TA implementation will start in August 2006 and end in July 2007. A midterm review will \nbe conducted . UNDP will prepare quarterly progress reports in a format to be agreed upon with \nADB, and will submit them to ADB within 1 month of the end of the period to which they refer. \nThe quarterly reports due at midterm and at the end of the TA will be replaced by more detailed \nreports. \n \n16.  The project will require approximately 63 person-months of international consultants and \n132 person-months of national consultant inputs.  Outline terms of reference for the consultant \npositions are in Appendix 4.  \n \n17.  UNDP will support the dissemination of the outputs through country, regional, and global \nmechanisms. At the national level, reports and analyses will be disseminated on CD-ROM, \nwhere  required,  as  well  as  through  web  portals.  The  regional  www.TsunamiTracking.org \nwebsite  administered  by  the  UNDP\u2019s  Regional  Centre  in  Bangkok  will  also  be  used  to \ndisseminate results. UNDP headquarters and the Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami \nRecovery will also publicize the results. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nSupport for Strengthening the Tsunami Development Assistance Database, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.

At a High-Level Coordination Meeting on Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Assistance \nto Tsunami-Affected Countries hosted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in March 2005, \nrepresentatives of tsunami-affected countries and their partners proposed that national tracking \nsystems be established to monitor the tsunami reconstruction process. These national systems \nwould be complemented by a regional database for easy access to multi-country information. \nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwere asked to collaborate with governments in implementing these recommendations. The \ngovernments  of  the  Maldives,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Thailand  asked  UNDP  to  customize  its \ndevelopment assistance database (DAD) so financial and technical assistance and results could \nbe tracked in each country. In August and September 2005, Indonesia\u2019s Rehabilitation and \nReconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias (BRR) decided to adopt the DAD model. \n \n2.  UNDP\u2019s Regional Project for Capacity Development for Tsunami Aid Coordination (the \nRegional  Project)  has  been  endorsed  by  the  four  countries  and  provides  an  overall \nimplementation framework for funding national and regional activities. The Regional Project is \nadministered by UNDP\u2019s Regional Centre in Bangkok. UNDP received funding to establish the \nproject from the United Nation\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in 2005. \n \n3.  The governments were consulted in the initial phase to ensure that the requirements of \nthe agencies selected by the governments to lead the tracking and coordination work had been \nunderstood. These agencies are (i) Indonesia (BRR); (ii) Maldives (Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury,  in  consultation  with  the Ministry  of Planning  and  National Development  and  the \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs); (iii) Sri Lanka (Task Force for Assisting the Nation [TAFREN], now \npart of Reconstruction and Development Agency); and (iv) Thailand (Thailand International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs).  \n \n4.  UNDP contracted a private sector firm, Synergy International Systems (a United States-\nbased firm whose similar work was used successfully in Afghanistan) to customize the DAD for \nthe four countries. Experienced aid coordination advisers were recruited for secondment into the \nagencies. If necessary, additional national staff who could lead the outreach to funding agencies, \nimplementers, and other ministries, and conduct analyses for decision makers were provided. \n \n5.  The aid coordination advisers have been assisting national colleagues in coordinating, \ntracking, and accountability activities. The advisers\u2019 detailed tasks include (i) providing analysis \nof decision making and financial gaps, and helping prepare training materials for government \nagents on using DAD for aid management in districts; (ii) adapting DAD to promote cross-\nchecking  of  local  information  supplied  by  partners  operating  out  of  Colombo,  Sri  Lanka; \n(iii) supporting senior management to use an aid and budget information management system \nfor better decision making; (iv) promoting effective tracking of off- and on-budget aid using the \nRecovery Aceh and Nias (RAN) system in Aceh; (v) reinforcing in-house capacity to develop in-\ndepth analyses regarding funding agency commitment performance, sector needs and gaps, \nand implementation constraints; and (vi) providing practical recommendations for action, in \nclose  consultation  with  national  stakeholders,  to  ensure  in-house  analytical  capacity  is \nreinforced  in  the  Maldives  and  Thailand.  National  staff  in  Aceh  have  been  helping  BRR \ndisseminate  data  on  projects,  sector  studies,  and  other  tsunami  assistance  information  to \ngovernment and aid community colleagues, and to the Indonesian people through the BRR ", "Supplementary Appendix    17\nwebsite  portal  and  other  mechanisms.  They  have  trained  to  gradually  assume  direct \nresponsibility for the further development and maintenance of the RAN system. \n \n6.  The  four  databases  in  Indonesia,  the  Maldives,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Thailand  are  fully \noperational and accessible to the public online. Websites, which are owned by the national \nauthorities, are in various stages of development. Outreach teams have been established and \ntrained to ensure that partners update the information. The databases present a comprehensive \npicture  of  available  resources.  E-mail  alerts  will  be  added,  which  will  enable  automatic \nnotification if information has not been updated during the past quarter. Another vital area is \nmoving  beyond  assessing  project  financing  to  ensuring  that  the  databases  enable  the \nimplementing partners to specify the intended outputs for each project. It is encouraging that the \ntsunami-affected  countries  have  begun  to  envisage  the  potential  use  of  DAD  beyond  the \ntsunami itself. In Sri Lanka, TAFREN has begun to use DAD to track projects in areas affected \nby conflict. In Aceh, where database development has been slower, an intensive action plan has \nbeen agreed with BRR to ensure that it catches up with the other countries. In Jakarta, servers \nare in place and domestically funded projects are being entered into the RAN system. In the \nMaldives, the government intends to use DAD to track all official development assistance, and is \nconsidering using DAD for domestically-funded investments. \n \n7.  The follow-up Regional Project is designed to meet the requests of the tsunami-affected \ncountries for support by delivering four national databases for tracking resources and results \ntailored to government requirements. It will build capacity in the national agencies through \ntraining. It also will complement the national DADs with a regional DAD that will make resource \nand results data from all countries available through a single regional portal. The Regional \nProject will establish a database to record private sector contributions to tsunami relief and \nrecovery and promote lesson learning and knowledge sharing across tsunami-affected countries. \n \n8.  At its completion, the Regional Project is expected to have achieved the following.  \noutputs. \n(i)  Nationally-owned  DADs  established,  providing  a  tool  for  transparent  and \naccountable management. \n(ii)  Capacity of national governments to track and coordinate external technical and \nfinancial assistance enhanced, overlaps reduced, and resource gaps identified \nand/or met. \n(iii)  Regional tsunami DAD established and regional analysis of results conducted. \n(iv)  Database and portal for tracking private sector contributions to tsunami relief and \nrecovery established. \n(v)  National authorities and international and national partners enjoying easy access \nto data to enhance decision making for tsunami recovery and reconstruction. \nLesson-learning across countries promoted. \n \n9.
