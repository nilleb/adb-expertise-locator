The Government of Cambodia asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance to prepare a program to develop the private sector and small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs). The program preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) reflects ADB\u2019s \ncontinuous support for private sector development (PSD) policy reform.1 Conceptualization of \nthis assistance was based on lessons from the implementation of past and ongoing projects and \nconsultations  with  the  Government.  The  PPTA  is  included  in  the  ADB  country  operations \nbusiness plan for Cambodia,2 which emphasizes private sector and SME development as one of \nthe key pillars of the development assistance strategy for the country. \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission visited Phnom Penh, Cambodia during 12\u201314 November 2007. \nThe  Mission  and  representatives  from  the  Government  held  discussions  and  reached  an \nunderstanding on the objective, scope, cost, and implementation arrangements for the PPTA. \nThe PPTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The challenge for the Government is to sustain its high economic growth of 9%\u201310% per \nannum, accelerate the creation of productive jobs, and continue reducing poverty. This is no \neasy task with half of the population under 20 years old and more than 80% of employment in \nthe informal sector (mainly subsistence agriculture). The Government recognizes that the key to \nsustaining high economic growth and poverty reduction is to diversify sources of growth (The \ninitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2). This requires more difficult reforms to \nimprove competitiveness throughout the supply chain. Sustaining high economic growth over \nthe longer term will require export diversification as well as building linkages between agriculture \nand the modern sector. Improving competitiveness by continuing to reduce distortions or costs \nat the border (such as tariff and nontariff policy barriers to trade, and inefficiencies in trade \nfacilitation), distortions within domestic trade, and improved access to technology will be critical \nto achieving this outcome. The Government considers the private sector will be central to its \ndiversification  strategy.  SMEs  are  the  dominant  business form  in  Cambodia  and  therefore \nshould be treated as the private sector norm and not the exception.  \n \n4.  Recent investment surveys and several value-chain studies have identified impediments \nto  Cambodia  realizing  its  medium-term  growth  potential.  Surveys  on  business  climate \nperceptions suggest that, among other factors, excessive red tape, remaining distortions in the \ntrade regime, tax administration, access to finance, and corruption are some of the major \nobstacles to private sector growth and development. Value-chain studies3 identify poor product \nquality,  an  inadequate  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards  (SPS)  policy  framework, \nunderdeveloped linkages between the rural and modern sectors of the economy, and relatively \ncostly logistics as constraints to export diversification. A common thread in many of these value-\nchain studies is a weak competition policy framework broadly defined to include remaining \ndistortions at the border and within domestic trade (or behind the border). On 5 December 2007, \nthe Government (Ministry of Commerce [MOC]) launched its Diagnostic Trade Integration Study \n(DTIS), which will provide a broad agenda for expanding the private sector by improving both \nforeign and domestic trade, and in particular developing efficient backward linkages in the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 December 2007. \n2  ADB. 2006. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia (2007\u20132009). Manila. \n3  Value-chain studies attempt to identify policy, structural, and other bottlenecks at each stage of the production \nprocess of a commodity, for example from farmer to the port. Studies of this type are a useful diagnostic tool for \nidentifying both crosscutting issues as well as sector-specific development issues. \n ", "2   \neconomy.4 The DTIS  will be a core element  of the Government\u2019s sectorwide approach to \ninternational trade integration. \n \n5.  SME Development. The Government sees access to finance, standards, and product \nquality as key impediments to SME development. Recent studies indicate that SMEs are more \nlikely to have problems accessing basic technology (both demand and supply side) compared to \nlarger firms. Interest rates charged by banks for lending to SMEs remains very high. Much has \nbeen done to improve the legal framework for improving SME access to finance, including the \nrecently passed law on secured transactions, which establishes the legal framework for secured \ncollateral on movables. The Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program (SMEDP) \nsupports the Government\u2019s efforts to draft a law on lease financing and simplifying accounting \nprocedures and guidelines for SMEs.5 The Second Financial Sector Program is supporting the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to improve intermediation and efficiency in banking.6 It will operationalize \nthe credit information bureau, which will improve SME access to credit in the longer term. \nImprovement in capacity to implement the law on secured transactions will help create a better \nlending environment for SMEs. Efforts are also needed to address demand-side gaps for credit, \nincluding improving the market for professional business services, product quality, and SPS.  \n \n6.  Trade  Policy  and  Export  Diversification.  The  ability  of  Cambodian  exporters  to \ncompete in commodities other than garments and tourism remains limited. Export diversification \nis  constrained  by  poor  product  quality,  unreliable  supply  especially  of  agriculture  produce, \ntechnical barriers to trade, inefficient logistics, and cumbersome export documentation. The \nGovernment has prioritized export diversification as an important source of economic growth \nand poverty reduction. The DTIS identifies 19 products as pilot studies for catalyzing a broad-\nbased reform agenda, while at the same time recognizing the necessity for specific reforms and \ncapacity-building  initiatives  in  some  sectors.  Meanwhile,  the  Government  is  completing  its \nremaining  World  Trade  Organization  commitments  including  developing  mechanisms  for \nantidumping and safeguards. In this regard, the Government must continue to strengthen its \nprocesses and procedures for trade policy formulation taking an economywide approach.  \n \n7.  Domestic Trade. The Government recognizes that the domestic trade services sector is \na major generator of jobs and incomes. It also recognizes that an efficient domestic distribution \nsystem is critical for getting products to international markets and for developing backward \nlinkages with agriculture. Improving logistics and trade facilitation are essential to successfully \ndevelop backward linkages. International experience demonstrates that the modern wholesale \nand  retail  sectors  (restaurants,  hotels,  supermarkets)  and  the  traditional  wet  markets  are \nimportant  channels  for  moving  goods  efficiently  from  the  farm  to  the  urban  consumer. \nSupermarkets are still in their infancy but experiencing rapid growth in line with Cambodia\u2019s \nrapidly growing per capita incomes. However, supermarkets and hotels import most of their \nfresh produce. Ensuring an enabling environment for the retail sector to continue to grow and at \nthe same time developing appropriate modalities for facilitating mutually commercial linkages \nbetween farmers and supermarkets will be critical if Cambodian farmers are to increase their \ngains from this longer-term growth. Success for farmers in the domestic market will be a \nplatform for success in the international market.  \n                                                 \n4  Ministry of Commerce. 2007.

The Government considers extending the business registry to the \nprovinces and commencing a licensing review as priorities for improving the investment climate. \nThe SMEDP is helping streamline registration procedures and established a national enterprise \nelectronic registry housed at MOC. This reform effort has significantly reduced the time required \nto register a business and resulted in increased business registration. Two pilot provinces have \nalmost completed establishment of a registry; the evaluation will provide lessons for extending \nthe registry to other provinces. \n \n9.  The Government lacks a system whereby laws and regulations affecting licensing and \ninspection  are  reviewed  to  determine  the  impact  on  the  private  sector.  As  a  result,  the \nGovernment lacks appreciation of the regulatory compliance costs imposed on the private \nsector. The Council of Ministers approved the licensing reform agenda and guidelines to line \nministries for carrying out a review developed under the SMEDP. Further reforms are required \nto develop or refine the appropriate mechanism for line ministries to commence the review. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the PPTA is to improve the business environment so that the private \nsector  can  operate  efficiently.  Two  outcomes  are  expected:  (i)  technical  inputs  to  the \nGovernment and ADB to formulate a private sector and SME development program loan that \nhelps reduce poverty and increase jobs by expanding the private sector, and (ii) technical \nbackground  papers  on  the  Government\u2019s  PSD  agenda  anchored  in  its  trade  development \nstrategy and DTIS. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The key PPTA activities are divided into four components; each component will be \nconsidered a stand-alone component.  \n \n12.  Component 1: SME Development. Several studies indicate that SMEs are more likely \nthan larger firms to have problems accessing basic technology and finance. This component will \ndevelop  a  series  of  technical  papers  that  explore  ways  to  address  these  SME-specific \nconstraints by (i) drawing on international best practices to assess the appropriate public policy \napproach and measures for promoting technology diffusion to SMEs, and design a practical \npolicy framework for technology; (ii) examining why interest rates are high; (iii) exploring ways to \nimprove the market for professional business service providers including accounting and other \nconsulting services; and (iv) drawing on ADB\u2019s trade facilitation work with the Greater Mekong \nSubregion to assess the policy and strategic framework for SPS and product quality, and \ndevelop the appropriate public and private policy response. \n \n13.  Component 2: Trade Policy and Export Diversification. A key development objective \nof the Government is to diversify exports through market-based reforms as articulated in the \nDTIS. Another objective is to strengthen capacity to formulate policy. This component will \nprovide a series of technical background papers that identify ways an ensuing PSD program \ncould assist the Government in achieving these two objectives. The PSD program is expected \nto be anchored in the Government\u2019s trade development strategy taking a sectorwide approach. \nActivities under this component include (i) synthesize the key findings of current value-chain \nstudies; identify key crosscutting policy, regulatory, and structural constraints facing producers; \n ", "4   \nand propose policy recommendations for the PSD program; (ii) support MOC with analytical \nwork  on  economywide  impacts  of  crosscutting  economic  reforms  (also  effective  rates  of \nprotection) to assist in prioritizing reform measures for the PSD program and build in-house \ncapacity to assess proposed preferential trade agreements; and (iii) identify ways the PSD \nprogram can assist MOC in building trade capacity such as developing the mechanism and \nhuman resource needs for antidumping and safeguards under its World Trade Organization \ncommitments and other related agencies.  \n \n14.  Component 3: Domestic Trade Sector. The consultants will work with the Government \nand stakeholders to explore ways to improve efficiency of domestic distribution as a key channel \nfor  supporting  trade  facilitation  and  exports,  and  developing  backward  linkages.  Activities \ninclude (i) develop appropriate public and private policy options, and design a program for \nlinking producers of horticulture produce (vegetables and fruits identified in the DTIS) with the \nmodern retail sector; and (ii) drawing on ADB\u2019s Greater Mekong Subregion trade facilitation \ninitiatives, identify measures to improve the logistics subsector using a sectorwide approach.  \n \n15.  Component 4: Investment Climate. This component comprises two activities: (i) work \nwith  the  Government  to  develop  its  competition  policy  framework;  and  (ii)  building  on  the \nbusiness climate reforms under the ongoing SMEDP, support Government efforts to establish \nbusiness registry offices in the provinces; and develop appropriate mechanisms for developing \na \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach to regulatory review. The consultants will draw on findings \nfrom  the  upcoming  World  Bank  investment  climate  assessment  in  developing  all  four \ncomponents.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated to be $650,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$550,000, financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The \nGovernment\u2019s contribution will be in-kind and cover items of expenditure estimated at $100,000 \nequivalent.  Appendix  3  gives  the  details  of  cost  estimates  and  the  financing  plan.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy will be the Executing Agency for the PPTA. \nMOC  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  The  ADB  project  team,  in  coordination  with  the \nCambodian  Resident  Mission,  will  coordinate  implementation  with  all  stakeholders  and \ndevelopment partners. \n \n18.  The PPTA will be implemented over 8 months from February 2008 to September 2008, \ncoinciding with the processing of the PSD program at the end of 2008. A team of international \nconsultants will be paired with national consultants (35 person-months total) to implement the \nPPTA  activities:  seven  international  consultants  for  11  person-months  and  six  national \nconsultants for 24 person-months. The terms of reference for the consulting services are in \nAppendix  4).  ADB  will  recruit  the  consultants  individually.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  consultants  will  procure  the  equipment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate advance disbursements for the \nfarmer supply survey, workshops, publications, and statistical software, an advance payment ", "  5\nfacility will be required. About two workshops will be held to encourage participatory discussions \nwith  stakeholders  from  Government,  the  private  sector,  and  development  partners  on  the \nvarious technical background papers and as input to preparation of the PSD program. About 50 \nparticipants are expected to attend each workshop. \n \n19.  The consultants will be responsible for providing reports and deliverables as required \nunder their terms of references. Each component will produce a final report on activities. The \ntiming of each PPTA activity will be determined in consultation with MOC. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Cambodia for preparing the Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Development Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved business  \u2022 Increased number of  National registry office,  \u2022  Macroeconomic \nenvironment where the  private enterprises  MOC  stability continues  \nprivate sector operates  formally registered   \nefficiently  (baseline 2006)  National Institute of \n  \u2022 Increased employment  Statistics  \nin the modern private  National income \nsector  accounts \n\u2022 Increased nongarment   \ntrade  IFC Doing Business \nReport \n \nADB missions \nOutcome      Assumptions \nA design for a loan  \u2022 Reform agenda to  DTIS report and matrix  \u2022  Champions of reform \nprogram for PSD,  improve SME access    are present in \nincluding support for  to technology and  PPTA completion report  ministries. \nimplementation of the  professional business    \u2022  Government stays on \nGovernment\u2019s trade  services  Midterm review report  course with its trade \ndevelopment strategy  \u2022 Reform agenda for    development strategy \nimproving foreign and  Stakeholder  and private sector \ndomestic trade and  consultations  reforms. \ncompetition policies  (workshops)  \u2022  Coordination within the \nand capacity    Government and with \n\u2022 Design of a public- Government-Donor  development partners \nprivate partnership  Private Sector  is effective. \nprogram for linking  Development Steering   \nfarmers with  Committee  Risk \nsupermarkets    \u2022  Elections in 2008 delay \nPrivate sector business  policy reform agenda  \nforum   \nOutputs       \n1.
