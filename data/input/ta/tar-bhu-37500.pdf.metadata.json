During the 2003 Country Programming Mission to Bhutan, the Government requested \nfurther  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to  build  the  capacity  of  the  National \nStatistical  Bureau  (NSB),  formerly  the  Central  Statistical  Organization  (CSO),  the  primary \nstatistical agency.  Considering that its thrust will support better policy making and formulation, \nthe technical assistance (TA) was included in the pipeline in 2003.  A  Fact-Finding Mission in \nAugust 2004 reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, and \nimplementation of the TA.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The CSO, an agency under the Ministry of Planning, had benefited from two previous \nstatistical capacity building assistance2 from ADB.  The two TAs put the CSO  toward the \ndirection of a modern statistical system capable of providing official statistics that are consistent \nwith international standards.  Technical advice and funding for survey operations enabled CSO \nto complete two household surveys that became the main data sources for social indicators and \npoverty statistics.  The compilation of a consumer price index  (CPI) and national accounts was \nalso improved by shifting these series to a more recent base year and incorporating new data \ninputs.3  Data collection for CPI was expanded to cover key geographical areas, while estimates \nfor national accounts were revised by including the results of the two households surveys and \nthe 2000 census of agriculture.  Some of the CSO staff were also trained in compiling official \nstatistics through apprenticeship programs.   \n \n3.  In October 2003, the Government decided to redesignate the Ministry of Planning as a \ndepartment under the Ministry of Finance.  The restructuring resulted in CSO becoming the \nNSB, an autonomous agency that reports to a newly created Statistical Board chaired by the \nMinister  of  Labor  and  Human  Resources,  with  deputy  secretaries  from  the  ministries  of \nagriculture, finance, health, and home affairs and Royal Monetary Authority as members.   The \nStatistical Board will be responsible for formulating policies and planning guidelines for NSB and \nall the data-producing government agencies.  NSB, in addition to its mandate as the primary \ncompiler of official statistics, will also support the Board\u2019s coordination functions.  \n \n4.  To undertake the coordination functions,  NSB will have to establish  a data support \nsystem  that  will  systematically  store  and  disseminate  statistics  compiled  by  various  data-\nproducing agencies, including metadata. Moreover, NSB has to complete the shift of national \naccounts to the more recent framework \u2014 the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA) \u2014 so \nthat the current structure of the economy can be better measured.   A master sample4 that will \nuse the first census of population that will be conducted in 2005 as a sampling frame will also \nhave to be formulated for future household surveys.  \n \n5.  While becoming autonomous is advantageous to NSB since it could now assert its \nprofessional independence, it also caused NSB some administrative problems that could disrupt  \nits data compilation and dissemination activities.  Because the Government directed NSB to find \nanother office location for its 42 technical and 12 support staff at the central office, the local area \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 5 August 2004. \n2  ADB. 1997. Strengthening the Central Statistical Organization. Manila (TA 2860, for $400,000); ADB. 2001. \nStrengthening the National Statistical System. Manila (TA 3669, for $600,000). \n3  Linking the new national accounts series with the previous time series (with 2000 as base year) is still ongoing.   \n4  A master sample is a sample from which subsamples can be selected to serve the needs of more than one survey \nor survey rounds. It is a set of sample units from which further selection may be done. ", "2   \nnetwork of the defunct Ministry of Planning that they now use and all other administrative \nsupport  that  were  previously  available  through  the  Ministry  of  Planning  will  no  longer  be \navailable to them.  For these reasons, the statistical capacity-building program that ADB has \nstarted must be continued to keep the momentum toward a modern statistical system.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The TA\u2019s goal is to strengthen the national statistical system.  The objectives are the \nfollowing:  (i)  to  provide  support  to  the  reorganization  of  the  NSB  and  the  newly  created \nStatistical Board, (ii) to continue  enhancing the compilation of national accounts, and (iii) to \nupgrade the technical skill level of NSB\u2019s staff. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  components:  (i)  provision  of  technical  support  and \nequipment to NSB and the Statistical Board, including the finalization of the Statistics Law; (ii) \nimprovement of national accounts; and (iii) apprenticeship programs for NSB staff.  To cover \nthese components, the TA will provide advisory services for statistical office management, \nnational  accounts,  and  database  development.    Computing  equipment  and  software  for \nestablishing a local area network will also be procured.   \n \n8.  Through consultations with data-producing agencies, NSB will develop  a designated \nstatistics program with the assistance of an expert.  The program will assign each category of \nofficial statistics to the agency that has the most suitable infrastructure to generate them.  This \nwill minimize duplication of activities, ensure the timely dissemination of statistics, and optimize \nthe very limited resources that the Government allocates to statistics.  The TA will also assist \nthe Statistical Board in developing a 3-year statistics plan that will provide better direction for \nNSB and other relevant agencies.  A statistical database will also be developed to store and \ndisseminate the designated statistics program, the metadata for each category of  statistics \nunder the program, all the available time series, information regarding surveys that have been \nconducted and those that need clearance from the Statistical Board, technical papers and lists \nof publications.  Application programs will be developed to retrieve and disseminate data and \ninformation from the database, to generate statistical reports, and to manage and update the \ndatabase. \n \n9.  National accounts statistics will be enhanced by the incorporation of price deflators \nformulated from the new CPI series and from the producers\u2019 price index that will have to be \ndeveloped, by revising estimates that would be generated from new data inputs and by initiating \nquarterly accounts.  Additional accounts as required by the 1993 SNA will also be developed to \ncomplete the shift from the 1968 SNA to the 1993 SNA. Special studies and small surveys will \nbe conducted to facilitate the development of these accounts.  \n  \n10.  In  addition  to  on-the-job  and  formal  training  that  NSB  staff  will  receive  from the \nconsultants, five apprenticeship programs will be supported by the TA, namely: (i) development \nof a master sample, (ii) compilation of national accounts, (iii) socioeconomic analysis of existing \nsurvey data,  (iv) administrative/financial, and (v) local area network administration and data \nprocessing.  Host statistical offices will be identified by ADB in consultation with NSB.  Such \noffices  will  be  requested  to  formulate  appropriate  programs  for  selected  NSB  staff.  \nApprenticeship on the development of a master sample will be undertaken when  population ", "    3\ndata have been processed and validated so that they could be used as a sampling frame.  All \nfuture household surveys could then avail of the master sample to ensure the consistency of \nstatistics generated from them.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $380,000 equivalent, of which $216,000 is the  foreign \nexchange cost and $164,000 equivalent is the local currency cost (Appendix 2).  ADB will \nfinance, on a grant basis, $250,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, to cover the \n$216,000 foreign exchange cost and $34,000 equivalent of the local cost.  The Government of \nBhutan will finance the balance of the local currency cost equivalent to $130,000, covering the \ncost of conducting sample surveys, paying counterpart staff salaries, making office facilities \navailable, and providing other administrative overhead. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA, which is expected to begin in December 2004, will be spread over 24 months, \nwith  completion  by  December  2006.  NSB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.    Aside  from  its \nadministrative functions, NSB will (i) provide counterpart staff to work with the consultants, (ii) \nseek government funding for surveys, and (iii) provide administrative and technical support to \nthe consultants. \n \n13.  The  Development  Indicators  and  Policy  Research  Division  of  the  Economics  and \nResearch Department (ERDI), in collaboration with  the South Asia Operations Coordination \nDivision, will administer the TA. ADB will coordinate TA implementation with other funding \nagencies, particularly the World Bank and United Nations Development Programme, to reduce \nduplication  of  activities.  TA  monitoring  and  review  will  be  done  through  ADB  missions, \ncorrespondence including e-mail, and reports of consultants. The ERDI project officer will \ncoordinate all activities of the TA and will liaise with NSB. NSB will submit an assessment report \nand recommendations for future action after completion of each major activity. \n \n14.  The TA will engage three international consultants: (i) a national accounts expert for 2 \nperson-months,  (ii)  a  statistics  office  management  expert  for  1  person-month, and (iii) a \ndatabase  developer  and  programmer  for  4  person-months.  The  ERDI  project  officer  will \ncoordinate the activities of the consultants. The consultants will be selected individually and will \nbe engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The NSB management and the consultants will recommend to ADB the candidates for \nthe apprenticeship programs. The selection criteria, terms, and conditions for the apprenticeship \nprogram  are  in  Appendix  4.  The  trainees  will  submit  in  a  report  to  NSB  and  ADB  their \nassessment of their apprenticeship program and their recommendations on how to incorporate \nwhat they have learned in their jobs. The Government will take the necessary steps to ensure \nthat staff who participate in the apprenticeship program will return and continue working for \nNSB. \n \n16.  Durable equipment will be purchased from the TA proceeds in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The equipment will be turned over to NSB upon completion of the \nTA. \n \n \n   ", "4   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.
