INTRODUCTION \n1.  CAREC  2020:  A  Strategic  Framework  for  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation Program 2011\u201320201 articulated two principal goals of cooperation for the period: \n(i)  trade  expansion  through  transport  connectivity,  transport  and  trade  facilitation,  trade \nopenness,  and  energy  trade;  and  (ii)  enhanced  competitiveness  through  improvement  of \nconnectivity, logistics and economic corridor development, and the development of related \nbusiness services. The CAREC Institute2 is considered one of the seven operational priorities in \npursuing these objectives. CAREC 2020 called on the CAREC Institute to strengthen capacities \nof various stakeholders to support the achievement of CAREC\u2019s strategic goals. As a lead \nagency for the CAREC program,3 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is requested by all \nmember countries to continue its support to the CAREC Institute through technical assistance \n(TA). \n \n2.  Conceptualization and formulation of the proposed TA is based on the 2010 CAREC \nInstitute Performance Assessment Review (CIPAR), various sector and subregional workshops \nundertaken in 2011, consultation missions to the majority of CAREC member countries, as well \nas recommendations received from senior officials\u2019 meetings (SOMs) and the 10th Ministerial \nConference.4 This 2-year consultation process included extensive discussions with government \nofficials  in  CAREC  member  countries,  participants  of  past  capacity  building  initiatives, \ndevelopment  partners,  and  other  nongovernmental  organizations.  Among  all  stakeholders, \nbroad agreement was reached on the expected impacts and outcomes of the TA, and strong \nsupport was obtained for its detailed design and implementation. Planned activities for 2013\u2013\n2015 was endorsed at the SOM and 11th Ministerial Conference held in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China in October 2012. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Capacity building has always been a key element in promoting regional cooperation \nunder the CAREC program. The CAREC Institute was established to (i) enhance the capabilities \nof CAREC government officials to engage in regional cooperation processes, and improve their \ncapacities to plan and implement regional cooperation projects; and (ii) apply new solutions and \nbest practices based on empirical research to regional challenges and cooperative processes, \nand build up policy analysis capabilities in the region. In 2010, the CIPAR confirmed progress \nmade  by  the  CAREC  Institute  in  achieving  its  objectives  and  proposed  a  set  of  interim \nrecommendations,  which  were  endorsed  by  the  Ninth  Ministerial  Conference  in  Cebu,  the \nPhilippines, in 2010. For the capacity building component, the CIPAR recommended (i) focusing \nmore on areas of sector-specific interest, (ii) involving the sector coordinating committees more \nsubstantively in the design of training programs, and (iii) mobilizing more funding sources in \nresponse to the increasing needs for capacity development under the CAREC program.6 This \n                                                \n1  CAREC 2020 was endorsed by the 10th Ministerial Conference on 23 November 2011 in Baku, Azerbaijan. \n2  CAREC countries established the CAREC Institute at the Sixth Ministerial Conference in 2007 as an integral \ncomponent of the CAREC program. The CAREC Institute has been operating in a virtual modality to date. The \nCAREC Unit in ADB acts as the secretariat of the CAREC Institute. \n3  More information about the CAREC program is available at www.carecprogram.org.  \n4  Summaries of proceedings of SOMs and the 10th Ministerial Conference are available at www.carecprogram.org.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2012.  \n6  To date, the CAREC Institute has drawn from ADB\u2019s regional TA, Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nInstitute, 2009\u20132012 (TA 6488-REG, $5.2 million, approved on 24 September 2008) for most of its programs.  \n ", "2   \nTA will address these issues by taking a more integrated approach among the key components \nof the CAREC Institute and through closer partnerships with other stakeholders.  \n \n4.  CAREC 2020 places strong emphasis on project implementation and achieving results \nas the CAREC program enters its second decade of cooperation. To this end, a medium-term \npriority  project  (MTPP)  list  accompanies  CAREC  2020  and  will  be  updated  annually.  For \nprojects to be included in the MTPP list, they must have a well-developed concept, supported by \na concrete financing and implementation plan, and must be reflected in the respective member \ncountry\u2019s national development plan. In order to successfully implement CAREC 2020 and the \nMTPP list, CAREC country capacity should be further strengthened in project and sector-related \npriority areas of cooperation. This should include (i) program and project development, planning, \nand analysis from a regional perspective; (ii) project management and implementation; and (iii) \nresults monitoring. This  TA  will  help  meet  sector  capacity  development  needs  of member \ncountries in implementing CAREC 2020 and hence support planning and implementation of \ntheir national development plans as well.  \n \n5.  The SOM held on 6\u20137 June 2012 in Hohhot, People\u2019s Republic of China, endorsed a \nstrategic knowledge framework (SKF) for the CAREC Institute 2012\u20132017. The SKF articulates \nthree primary components,7 including knowledge services, that promote knowledge sharing \nthrough capacity building interventions. It requires the CAREC Institute to focus its interventions \non addressing new challenges that CAREC countries face in achieving the goals of cooperation \nas stipulated in CAREC 2020, namely expanding trade and improving competitiveness. This TA \nwill contribute to effective implementation of investment and policy measures undertaken by \nCAREC countries across all areas of operational priority. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n6.  The TA will be a continuation of ADB\u2019s firm commitment to support the CAREC program \nthrough  capacity  building  initiatives,  and  to  complement  earlier  and  ongoing  TA  projects, \nincluding (i) TA for Capacity Building for Regional Cooperation in Central Asia (2004\u20132008, \n$950,000);8 (ii) TA for Strengthening Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, 2007\u20132009 \n(2007\u2013present, $9,750,000);9 and (iii) TA for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nInstitute, 2009\u20132012 (2009\u2013present, $5,200,000).10 \n \n7.  Since inception, the CAREC program has followed a phased approach, moving from \nconsensus building and institutional assessments to formulation of sector strategies and action \nplans,  and  on  to  identification  and  implementation  of  investment  projects  with  a  regional \ndimension, as highlighted in CAREC 2020. Previous TAs mainly supported development of \ninstitutional arrangements and professional development in close coordination with the CAREC \nprogram. The TA will focus on addressing member countries\u2019 specific capacity development \nneeds to implement CAREC 2020 and achieve tangible results.  \n \n                                                \n7  As stated in the SKF, the CAREC Institute has three components: knowledge generation, knowledge services, and \nknowledge management. \n8  ADB. 2003.

The expected impact of the TA is more efficient and effective implementation of priority \nCAREC projects11 with a regional dimension and mutual benefits for CAREC countries. The \nexpected outcome of the TA is improved capacity of the CAREC member countries to plan, \nmanage, and implement projects that contribute to the goals and objectives of CAREC 2020. \nThe impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved largely through development and delivery of \na set of demand-driven learning programs in a sustainable manner, as outlined below. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Giving more attention and resources to sector capacity building was recognized by all \nCAREC countries as one of the operational imperatives for the CAREC program during its next \ndecade of cooperation. In providing knowledge services, the CAREC Institute will add specific \nvalue as a capacity building provider that addresses knowledge gaps in a regional context, as \ndistinct  from  national  capacity  building  institutions  that  focus  on  national  concerns. \nOperationally, this means that learning programs must be designed in the context of the CAREC \nregion, taking into account the unique circumstances of the countries and the region as a whole. \nMain outputs of the TA are (i) knowledge service activities included in the first three years of \nCAREC Institute Work Plan 2013\u20132017;12 (ii) customized training modules to address specific \nissues faced by CAREC countries in planning and implementing CAREC projects; and (iii) a \nsustainable capacity building program to support implementation of CAREC 2020.  \n \n10.  This value-proposition of the CAREC Institute has important implications for the design \nand delivery of its capacity building programs. First, the design of learning programs should be \ncustomized,  including  the  development  of  learning  materials.  Second,  knowledge  service \nproviders must be selected on the basis of their knowledge and experience of the region\u2014\nespecially if they are sourced from outside the CAREC region. Third, although the CAREC \nInstitute is primarily focused on \u2015regional\u2016 learning programs, it must endeavor to link with \nrelevant \u2015national\u2016 training programs to create as much synergy with these activities as possible.  \n \n11.  In planning and developing the set of learning programs to be conducted under the TA \nduring 2013\u20132015, the CAREC Institute will be guided by the following imperatives:  \n(i)  Learning programs will be categorized as strategic, managerial or operational. \nThis will determine whether the course will focus on knowledge and/or skills, as \nwell as the required level of CAREC participants. For any given subject area, \ncapacity building requirements vary at different levels of the organization. For \nexample, capacity building requirements at a junior level involve tools for data \nanalysis.  These  could  be  generic  (e.g.,  economic  analysis,  statistical \nmeasurements,  forecasting,  cost\u2013benefit  analysis)  or  sector  specific  (e.g., \nmeasurements  of  trade  creation  and  trade  diversion).  The  analytical  tasks \nexpected from mid-level officials require a combination of established skills and \nknowledge. While mid-level officials also work with data, they are expected to \ntransform or process the data into information that is useful for management and \ndecision making. This normally requires analysis that relates country data and/or \ninformation to knowledge about regional and global developments. The senior \n                                                \n11 The priority sectors of cooperation under the CAREC program are transport, energy, trade facilitation, and trade \npolicy. \n12 CAREC Institute Work Plan 2013\u20132017 was endorsed by the 11th Ministerial Conference on 30 October 2012 in \nWuhan, People\u2019s Republic of China. \n ", "4   \nlevels in an organization are where plans, strategies, and policies are formulated. \nThe most important skill required at this level is strategic thinking, i.e. the ability \nto weigh options and trade-offs in the process of advancing the country\u2019s national \ninterest, in the context of a collective decision process. \n(ii)  Learning programs will apply the appropriate pedagogical tools based on the \nprinciples of adult learning. This requires that learners be engaged actively in the \nlearning process. \n(iii)  Learning  programs  will  strengthen  partnerships  with  other  capacity  building \npartners in both financial and technical terms. This requires that the CAREC \nInstitute and partner institutions have a shared understanding of the principles \ninvolved in the design of the learning program in support of the capacity building \nrequirements of the partner institutions. \n(iv)  Learning programs will include assessment tools that measure the extent to \nwhich  learning  objectives  have  been  met,  and  overall  effectiveness  of  the \nprogram in terms of content, pedagogy and process, learning materials, faculty, \nand logistics arrangement. \n \n12.  The TA will focus on strengthening the capacity development needs of CAREC countries \nin the priority sectors of cooperation and selected second tier areas.13 An indicative set of key \nactivities to be undertaken under the TA is as follows: \n(i)  In transport, development and delivery of learning programs is envisaged in the \nareas of investment strategy, performance-based road maintenance contracts, \nand road safety. \n(ii)  In energy, enhancement of institutional capacity will be provided in the areas of \ncommercial  energy  operations,  energy  sector  regulation,  public\u2013private \npartnership  arrangement,  demand-side  management,  energy  efficiency  and \nconservation, alternative and renewable energy, and riparian issues. \n(iii)  In trade facilitation, learning programs will be implemented in the areas of single \nwindow  strategic  development,  customs  inspection  and  risk  management \ntechniques, logistics development, and management. A user-friendly, web-based \nlearning  toolkit  for  designing  and  implementing  cross-border  projects  will  be \ndeveloped. \n(iv)  In  trade  policy,  the  current  knowledge-sharing  program  on  World  Trade \nOrganization  accessions  will  be  pursued.  A  more  structured  and  long-term \napproach  to  capacity  building  in  support  of  the  World  Trade  Organization \naccession process will be further developed, in collaboration with other CAREC \nmultilateral institutions and non-CAREC development partners.14 \n(v)  The CAREC Institute will conduct analytical work to identify key areas where \ninitiatives in the priority sectors could be enhanced by special efforts in second \ntier  areas.  On  this  basis,  and  subject  to  availability  of  resources,  CAREC \nmembers may initiate training activities in second tier areas. \n(vi)  High-level forums, seminars, and dialogues involving internationally renowned \nexperts on CAREC priority and cross-sector concerns will be organized from time \nto time, preferably in conjunction with major CAREC events.  \n \n                                                \n13 The  second  tier  areas  of  cooperation  under  the  CAREC  program  include  communicable  disease  control, \nagriculture, disaster risk management, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. \n14 CAREC. 2012.

The TA is estimated to cost $1,900,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund\u2014comprising $1,100,000 from TASF-IV and \n$400,000  from  TASF-other  sources;  and  (ii)  $400,000  by  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \nRegional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund, which will be administered by ADB. The \ngovernments  of  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Kazakhstan,  the \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, secretarial assistance, office supplies, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. As a \ngeneral rule set out by the CAREC countries, the CAREC Institute is required to seek support, \nboth in funding and in kind, from the CAREC participating governments, development partners, \nand other institutions for all capacity building activities under the TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, during January 2013\u2013December 2015. \nADB will be the executing agency, and ADB\u2019s CAREC Unit in the Central and West Asia \nRegional Department\u2014acting as the implementing agency and the secretariat of the CAREC \nInstitute\u2014will be responsible for overall and day-to-day implementation of TA activities. The \nCAREC Unit will work closely with ADB\u2019s East Asia Regional Department to implement the TA. \nAlthough a work plan for the CAREC Institute will be reviewed regularly by the CAREC SOMs, \nADB  will  obtain  no-objections  from  CAREC  participating  countries  before  the  TA  project \nundertakes specific activities.  \n \n15.  About 25 person-months of international and 15 person-months of national consultant \ninputs will be required to provide advisory and technical services under the TA. The consultants \nand resource people will be specialists in the areas of transport, energy, trade facilitation, \nfinancial and economic analysis, and other fields related to implementation of CAREC 2020. As \nthe  TA  will  involve  different  activities  consisting  mostly  of  straightforward  assignments, \nconsultants and resource people will be selected and engaged by ADB as individuals, based on \ntheir  qualifications  and  experience  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n16.  The TA will be monitored by sector coordination committees and ADB\u2019s CAREC Unit, as \nsecretariat of the CAREC Institute. Evaluation of the TA\u2019s outputs will be done through the \nperiodic performance review of the CAREC Institute, with the assistance of the CAREC National \nFocal Points in all member countries. TA implementation will also be reviewed during the \nCAREC biannual SOMs. Good practice and lessons learned from the TA will be documented in \nthe progress reports submitted to CAREC SOMs and posted at www.carecprogram.org. \n \nIV.
