The Government of Viet Nam (the Government) is planning to upgrade the country\u2019s \npublic health sector through regional projects based on the sector\u2019s Five-Year Plan (2006\u2013\n2010).1 The Ministry of Health (MOH) has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support \nthe Health Care in the South Central Coast Region Project (the project), while the World Bank is \nto support a similar project for the north central coast region.2 In July 2006, ADB fielded the \nFact-Finding Mission (the Mission) for a project preparatory technical assistance (TA). The \nMission discussed the proposed project with the Government, aid agencies, and provincial \nstakeholders. The Government and the Mission reached an understanding on the project scope, \nas  well  as the  TA  design  and  implementation  arrangements,  as confirmed  by  MOH  on  6 \nSeptember 2006. The design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.3 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Government remains strongly committed to providing quality health care for all its \ncitizens. It has been operating an extensive health care network of commune health stations \n(CHS), policlinics, district health centers, hospitals, and national programs under MOH. The \nGovernment  employs  a  large  workforce,  and  also  works  with  retired  health  staff  and  war \nveterans  to  help  reach  rural  populations.  Since  the  early  1990s,  private  practitioners  and \npharmacies have been expanding rapidly, although hospital services remain largely public.   \n \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s health indicators are surprisingly good for a country at its level of per capita \nincome. The infant mortality rate reportedly fell from 30 per 1,000 live births in 2002 to 19 per \n1,000 in 2005, while the maternal mortality ratio dropped from 130 per 100,000 live births in \n2000  to  85  per  100,000  live  births  in  2005.  Having  reached  some  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals for 2015, the Government has formulated the Viet Nam development goals. \nThe country is in an epidemiological transition\u2014the burden of communicable diseases fell to \nabout 25% of the total burden of diseases, from 50% three decades ago. Road accidents, \ncardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases, and other welfare-related diseases are now \ncommon causes of morbidity and mortality. However, reaching Viet Nam\u2019s development goals \nfor  health  requires  addressing  the  high  residual  burden  of  communicable  diseases  and \nreproductive health problems in lagging communities, including in ethnic minority communities. \nChild malnutrition, which is related to poverty, care, and common infections, remains high at \n27%. HIV has continued to spread, and 0.5% of the adult population is infected. Viet Nam also \nhas had avian influenza outbreaks in birds, and is preparing for a human epidemic.    \n \n4.  Changing  demography  and  behavior,  urbanization,  and  other  developments  are \nincreasing the demand for hospital services, while poor rural communities lack basic health \nservices.4 The political leadership, while appreciating the gains in the sector, has noted (i) a lack \nof adaptation to changing disease patterns and to the market economy; (ii) poor quality of \nservices;  and  (iii)  problems  in  meeting  the  needs  of  the  poor  and those  living  in  remote, \nmountainous, and minority areas.5 The difficulty in addressing this double burden of disease is \nattributed to a failure to match demand side and supply side elements in a health system that \nhas been \u201cstagnant in reforms\u201d and requires adaptation to the socialist market economy.   \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Health. 2006.

MOH\u2019s  2006\u20132010  plan  calls  for  making  access  and  use  of  health  services  more \nequitable and effective to protect and promote people\u2019s health. The plan also aims to improve \nthe quality of health care at all levels, with special attention to the poor, women, children, \nhandicapped, minority groups, and those living in remote and disadvantaged areas.6 Further, \nthe plan seeks to (i) reduce malnutrition and mortality in children, (ii) reduce maternal mortality, \n(iii) control communicable diseases, (iv) prevent and control noncommunicable diseases, (v) \novercome the consequences caused by accidents and injuries, and (vi) assure food and blood \nsafety. This is to be achieved by consolidating and upgrading the health network from CHS to \nregional  medical  centers,  modernizing  medical  equipment,  improving  the  training  of  health \nworkers, and other measures. The MOH plan adopts a dual approach of upgrading hospital \nservices, while improving services for lagging communities with poor health indicators, including \nminority communities. However, the plan is a continuation of the current public health sector \ndelivery system, and does not fully address some of the main issues affecting the equity, \nefficiency, and effectiveness of the health sector.  \n \n6.  Poor households lack financial access to primary health care, which undermines equity \nin the sector. After the agricultural reforms of Doi Moi, the grassroots network of CHS and \nextension workers collapsed, reducing access for the poor. In the 1990s, the Government \nallowed  private  practice  and  out-of-pocket  payment  at  public  health  facilities.  This  greatly \nimproved the availability of services, but not affordability for the poor. MOH, among others, \naddressed this issue through the establishment of equity funds for the poor. However, more \nwork is needed to improve and sustain arrangements to increase health benefits for the poor.7  \n \n7.  Another  equity  issue  is  the  care  of  poor  women  and  children,  many  of  whom  are \nminorities. Coverage of maternal services is limited and often substandard. This includes some \nspecific problems, such as invasive family planning services. Many poor women deliver without \na  trained  birth  attendant,  and  neonatal  mortality  remains  high.  Malnutrition,  which  is  still \nrelatively high among the poor, could be reduced with relatively low-cost interventions, such as \nmaternal  education,  treatment  of  common  infections,  and  micronutrients.  These  types  of \ninterventions require the strengthening of community-based health care, outreach, and referral \nservices. \n \n8.  The efficiency and effectiveness of health spending in Viet Nam is about average for the \nregion. Viet Nam spends about $21 per person per year on health, including $15 from private \nsources, explaining in part the improvements in health indicators. Most of this is for curative \ncare, with the larger hospitals consuming a major share of the public sector budget. While MOH \nhas increased support for health promotion and prevention recently, much remains to be done \nin this field to address diseases associated with poverty and welfare.    \n \n9.  The quality of health care remains a major problem affecting all services, with two \nimportant dimensions\u2014staff performance and recurrent funds. Staff lack skills-based training. \nCurrent policies do not encourage medical staff to work in remote and disadvantaged areas. \nMinorities are underrepresented among health staff in health centers serving their communities. \nInadequate  funds  are  allocated  for  recurrent  costs,  including  pay,  supplies,  services,  and \nmaintenance and repair. Staff pay barely covers basic living costs, requiring many to find other \nwork or double as a private practitioner. Incentives for field work are low.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Health. 2006.

Hanoi. \n ", "  3\n10.  Viet Nam\u2019s efforts to adjust the public health system to changing needs have been \nmodest compared to other countries in the region with similar problems, perhaps because the \ncurrent system appears to be working fairly well. However, MOH realizes it needs to initiate a \nprocess of health system development and reform to continue improving health indicators. In \naddition to a joint national reform program being developed in consultation with aid agencies, \nMOH is planning to develop provincial health systems through regional projects. These, along \nwith improving health benefits, will drive demand for, and respond to, reforms.  \n \n11.  Improving access, quality, and affordability of provincial health services involves a wide \nrange of challenges, including (i) balancing basic care and hospital services; (ii) shifting from \ncurative care to health promotion; (iii) integrating national programs at the provincial level; (iv) \naddressing human resource problems, including staff skills, and posting competent staff to \nCHSs; (v) financing hospital services and health care for the poor; and (vi) stimulating and \nregulating the private sector, particularly regarding the quality of health services and medicines. \nThere are  also opportunities for improving public health services through enhanced public \ninvolvement and professional associations. Private hospitals could help make new technology \navailable,  and  reduce  the  burden  of  public  hospitals.  At  the  same  time,  strong  provincial \ngovernment  commitment,  stewardship,  autonomy,  and  responsiveness  to  public  needs  are \nessential to address these opportunities and challenges. Funding agencies could facilitate this \ndevelopment and reform process by supporting national and local governments to conduct \nsector  analysis  and  capacity  building  towards  an  integrated,  results-based  approach  to \nimproved outcome and health systems development.   \n \n12.  ADB currently supports provincial health system development through two projects,8 \nwhile the World Bank supports similar projects in the northern mountains and Mekong regions. \nBoth banks have been asked to support the central region, which has received less investment \nin health infrastructure and health care for the poor. MOH favors such a regional approach, and \nhas asked ADB and World Bank to coordinate these projects. MOH has prepared a concept \npaper for the proposed project to guide the TA. Cast within MOH\u2019s strategic framework, the \nproposal involves an investment of the equivalent of $80 million for the south central coast \nregion to improve the health of the people, especially the poor, women, minorities, and other \ndisadvantaged groups. The proposal covers four areas: (i) provincial health services, (ii) human \nresources development, (iii) health care for the poor, and (iv) provincial health system management. \nMOH (Planning and Finance Department) will be the Executing Agency. As envisaged, the \nproposed project will be implemented over 5 years. Given the governance and financing issues, \nsuch a regional project could be designed as a sector development program, and support \nnational policy reforms and recurrent cost implications, provided that national arrangements and \nconditions can be put in place.     \n \n13.  ADB-funded health projects are generally satisfactory. The projects typically start slowly \ndue  to  initial  capacity  constraints  in  project  management  and  at  the  provincial  level,  and \nsometimes unclear Government regulations. While MOH has built substantial capacity in project \nmanagement, including financial management, it lacks experience in program lending. MOH\u2019s \ncapacity in improving health care for the poor also needs attention. Equity funds require regular \nadjustment to follow new directives or address implementation issues, and their impact and \nsustainability are unknown.    \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004.

The TA is to help prepare a regional project that will improve the health status of the \ntargeted population, particularly the poor, women, children, and other vulnerable groups. The \nproject will strengthen provincial health systems in seven provinces and one city in the south \ncentral coast region.9 The TA will produce a project design that has strong local ownership, is \nacceptable to all stakeholders, and is linked to national policy actions. Provincial governments \nwill improve their understanding of health issues and priorities, while provincial health teams will \ndevelop stronger capacity for health sector planning and budgeting. An initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The  TA  will  (i)  analyze  the  provincial  health  system,  and  related  governance  and \nfinancing aspects; (ii) assess and initially strengthen provincial health staff capacity in planning \nand budgeting, financial management, and monitoring; (iii) conduct a participatory planning \nprocess to identify priorities for policy reform, capacity building, and investment; and (iv) prepare \na project proposal, Government pre-feasibility and feasibility reports, and implementation plan \nfor possible assistance of ADB and other agencies.  \n \n16.  In the first month, the TA team (staff and consultants) will review sector performance, \nnational policies and plans, and previous experience. It also will consult with ministries and \npartners in Hanoi, provincial officials and staff, and potential beneficiaries. These inputs will be \nused to identify the main issues and plan further analysis of policies, the provincial health \nsystem, governance, and financing aspects. They also will be used to conduct stakeholder \nconsultations over the following 2 months. After a midterm review of the analysis, consultants \nand counterparts will conduct a 2-month participatory planning process to prepare a draft project \nproposal, which will be finalized with Government and ADB inputs over the next month.     \n \n17.  During the analysis, the TA team will analyze (i) the needs, services, issues, policies, \nand plans of provincial health systems; (ii) management and financing practices; (iii) provincial \n5-year plans and medium-term expenditure frameworks; (iv) situation and development needs \nof hospital services based on spatial distribution, demand for services, resources, and hospital \nfinancing and management; (v) health care and equity funds for the poor; (vi) human resources \ndevelopment,  including  shortfalls,  standards,  quality  of  training,  and  resources;  and  (vii) \nfinancing modalities. The team also will visit other regional projects, and help develop provincial \nhealth sector plans in coordination with the World Bank and other agencies.  \n \n18.  To help ensure synergies across regions, the team\u2014with the support of MOH, ADB, and \nother development agencies\u2014will organize two workshops in the central region to review two \naspects of provincial health system development: (i) urbanization, welfare diseases, and private \nhealth  sector  development;  and  (ii)  strategic  options  to  improve  equity,  efficiency,  and \neffectiveness of public health services. The team also will provide orientation of local leaders \n                                                 \n9  Danang City and the provinces of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, and \nBinh Thuan.

Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $600,000. ADB will finance $450,000 on a \ngrant basis through ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide the equivalent of \n$150,000 through in-kind contributions for counterpart staff, workshops, and facilities. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  MOH will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The ADB project steering committee in \nMOH, chaired by a deputy minister of health, will meet to review and guide TA work after \ninception, completion of the analysis, and completion of the draft final report. The Planning and \nFinance Department of MOH will be responsible for TA implementation. MOH will appoint a \npart-time project director and a full-time deputy project director for the TA. The deputy director \nand the team leader jointly will lead a regional TA team representing the seven provinces and \none city, departments, and consultants. The director of the Planning and Finance Department \nwill provide overall leadership, and arrange monthly meetings to guide and coordinate TA \nactivities. In each province, the provincial health officer will head a provincial team, including \nrepresentatives of the provincial government, MOH, civil society, and consultants, to guide the \nplanning process.   \n \n21.  ADB will support 17 person-months of international consulting services (person-months \nare in parentheses), including a team leader and public health management expert (5), a health \neconomist (4), a health care quality improvement expert (4), and a sociologist (4). ADB also will \nsupport 22 person-months of national consulting services, including a public health expert and \ndeputy team leader (10), a financial management expert (4), a community development expert \n(4), and a health infrastructure expert (4). ADB will engage the consultants individually in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  International  and  national \nconsultants will work together with counterparts to perform the services. The indicative outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. MOH will procure equipment under the TA \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  MOH  will  retain  the  equipment  on \ncompletion of the TA. \n   \n22.  The deputy project director and team leader will submit an inception report to MOH and \nADB within 1 month of TA implementation. A sector analysis will be submitted at midterm, along \nwith a project concept and draft project framework. The draft final report will be submitted after 5 \nmonths, and a final report and implementation memorandum after 6 months. The TA, which will \nbecome effective around 1 November 2006, will be completed within 1 year.      \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Health Care in the South Central Coast Region \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  6  Appendix 1 \nINDICATIVE DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpacts       \n       \nImproved health in the target  On completion of the ensuing  Household survey  Assumption \npopulation:  project, health indicators will     \nimprove as follows: (i) infant    \u2022  Data are available \n1.
