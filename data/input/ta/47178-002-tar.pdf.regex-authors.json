The  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA) was  first  included  in  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country operations business plan for Viet Nam, 2013\u20132015.1 The TA \nwill seek inclusive growth by promoting the poor\u2019s access to microfinance in line with the country \npartnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015.2 It  will  support  the  government  in  developing  a  market-\noriented  microfinance  sector  through  integration  into  the  banking  sector,  along  with  the \nViet Nam Microfinance Development Strategy, 2011\u201320203 and the ongoing ADB Microfinance \nDevelopment Program (MDP).4 It will also identify longer-term sector development issues that \ncan be addressed by future ADB assistance beyond the MDP implementation period.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  government\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  program\u2014focusing  on  modernizing \nagriculture,  and  promoting  nonfarm  household  businesses  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises\u2014has reduced the poverty rate from 58% in 1993 to 10% in 2012. While Viet Nam is \npoised to achieve many of its Millennium Development Goals by 2015, the lack of access to \nresponsive  financial  services  for  poor  and  low-income  household  clients  remains  a  major \nconstraint to achieving the goals. \n \n3.  Government commitment to market-oriented sector reform. Recognizing the vital \nrole of microfinance in poverty reduction, the Viet Nam Microfinance Development Strategy was \nformulated with ADB assistance.5 The strategy reflects the government\u2019s commitment to a \nmarket-oriented sector reform, with the aim of: \n(i)  establishing the legal, policy, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks;  \n(ii)  strengthening policy formulation and regulatory and supervisory capacity;  \n(iii)  enhancing the operational capacity of microfinance institutions (MFIs);  \n(iv)  improving the institutional and financial capacities of the Vietnam Bank for Social \nPolicies (VBSP), and helping implement its development strategy to achieve self-\nsustaining and market-oriented microfinance operations;  \n(v)  developing financial infrastructure, including training institutes and a microcredit \ninformation bureau; and  \n(vi)  promoting nationwide financial literacy campaigns. \n \n4.  Microfinance Development Program. On 5 July 2012, ADB approved the MDP, which \nincludes a $40 million policy-based loan for subprogram 1 and $0.5 million attached TA. The \nprogram supports government initiatives to develop a market-oriented microfinance sector and \nimprove  access  to  formal  financial  services  for  the  poor,  especially  in  rural  areas.  It  was \nformulated to promote fair competition among diverse financial institutions, and to support the \nprivate sector\u2019s role in microfinance\u2014gradually reducing the government\u2019s direct involvement in \nmicrofinance operations. To this end, the MDP focuses on four broad areas: (i) policy and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2013\u20132015. Manila. The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 August 2013. The design and framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2012.

During the MDP subprogram 2 period (2012\u20132014), regulations and supervisory norms \nconcerning microfinance have been drafted, while microfinance supervisory capacity is being \nenhanced under the formulated regulatory framework. Formulating the microfinance regulatory \nframework will promote private sector development, with a growing number of MFIs applying for \na license from the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), which will help them mobilize savings and \nstrengthen their institutional and operational capacities. The MDP also promotes development \ncoordination with the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, which provides \nassistance  to  emerging  licensed  MFIs.  VBSP  is  implementing  its  development  strategy  to \nbecome  a  self-sustaining  financial  institution  operating  on  market-based  principles.  The \nCooperative Bank transformed from the Central People\u2019s Credit Fund will strengthen its capacity \nto serve the member people\u2019s credit funds (PCFs) via a capital increase and training program \nunder the MDP. This is strengthened by development coordination with Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement, providing capacity development support in collaboration with ADB. Financial \ninfrastructure\u2014including  formal  microfinance  training,  advocacy  of  financial  literacy  on \nsustainable microfinance and customer protection, and credit information exchange systems\u2014\nhas been developed to support sector performance and development.  \n \n6.  Longer-term  sector  development  issues. Medium-term direction beyond the MDP \nimplementation period was identified and included in the MDP programmatic approach. As \nreforms in the microfinance sector are ongoing, it is necessary to formulate a refined post-\nprogram monitoring framework toward the overarching goal of sector development in the longer \nterm. New recommendations for government actions and/or investment toward this goal can be \nincluded in future ADB assistance after the MDP implementation period is over. \n \n7.  The TA will formulate an updated sector assessment and road map for ADB\u2019s long-term \nassistance, while monitoring, coordinating, and strengthening ongoing MDP activities. It will also \ndiagnose and renew medium- and long-term sector development agendas beyond the MDP \nimplementation period, 2008\u20132014, to align with the microfinance development strategy; and \nrecommend actions to achieve them. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be greater financial inclusion and a deepened financial sector. The \noutcome  will  be  an  improved  institutional  and  regulatory  environment  for  microfinance \ndevelopment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The  TA  will  have  three  main  outputs,  which  will  be  delivered  via  the  following \nmethodology and activities. \n \n10.  Output 1: An updated microfinance sector assessment and road map for ADB\u2019s \nlong-term assistance. A microfinance sector assessment prepared for the MDP subprogram 1 \nwill be updated, analyzing issues related to long-term sector development and providing inputs \nto the design of a sector strategy and road map for ADB interventions. The sector assessment \n ", "3 \nwill  be  the  analytical  basis  for  ADB\u2013government  policy  dialogue  to  help  the  government \nimplement the microfinance development strategy and formulate future ADB assistance beyond \nthe MDP implementation period.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Strengthened sustainability of the Microfinance Development Program. \nThe MDP is supporting government initiatives to develop market-oriented microfinance along \nwith the Viet Nam Microfinance Development Strategy and the Credit Institutions Law, 2010. \nThe TA will monitor, coordinate, and strengthen the sustainability of ongoing MDP activities in \nthe following areas: \n(i)  Creating a policy and regulatory environment conducive to an inclusive, \nsustainable,  and  market-oriented  microfinance  sector.  Under  the  MDP \nsubprogram  2,  the  implementing  rules  and  regulations  on  SBV  licensing \nrequirements and prudential norms for MFIs\u2014based on performance standards, \ncredit classification, and provision standards\u2014have been drafted. The TA will \nclosely monitor their finalization through interministerial consultations and provide \nnecessary recommendations. It will also provide advice to the government in \nformulating  the  implementing  rules  and  regulations  on  audit  and  reporting \nrequirements  applicable  to  VBSP,  PCFs,  and  other  microfinance  credit \ninstitutions to secure the integrity and transparency of microfinance operations.  \n(ii)  Strengthening the supervisory capacity over microfinance. Few regulators \nare qualified to provide effective supervision of the microfinance sector since the \nsector was only recently formalized. The SBV needs to improve its regulatory \ncapacity, focusing on microfinance, including MFI performance standards and \nbest practices unique to microfinance operations. Capacity development TA will \nhelp the government strengthen the overall supervisory capacity.6 The proposed \nTA will monitor the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen the capacity of oversight \nagencies, provide policy advice, and coordinate capacity development assistance \nwith the ADB capacity development TA team and development partners.   \n(iii)  Strengthening  credit  institutions  involved  in  microfinance  to  provide \naffordable  and  sustainable  services  to  the  poor.  The  proposed  TA  will \nmonitor the ongoing reform efforts of microfinance-involved financial institutions \nincluding  VBSP,  the  Cooperative  Bank,  PCFs,  and  MFIs  in  strengthening \ninstitutional and operational capacity. It will also monitor fiscal supports to these \nefforts, provide policy advice, and coordinate capacity development assistance \nwith the ADB capacity development TA team and development partners.  \n(iv)  Supporting development of financial infrastructure for microfinance. The \nproposed TA will monitor and assess the development of financial infrastructure, \nincluding training institutes, financial literacy programs, and the credit information \nexchange system. It will also monitor fiscal supports to these efforts, provide \npolicy advice, and coordinate capacity development assistance.  \n \n12.  Output 3: Longer-term sector development issues and actions identified. While the \nMDP subprogram 2 aims to achieve healthy sector development during 2012\u20132014, remaining \ndevelopment issues must be identified to achieve the overarching goal of a fully market-based \nmicrofinance sector beyond the MDP period to be covered by the post-program monitoring \nframework. The TA will clarify longer-term sector development agendas, which can include \n(i) wholesale lending institutions supporting institutional development and day-to-day operations \nof  MFIs,  (ii)  rating  agencies  promoting  investment  in  microfinance,  (iii)  an  action  plan  for \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2013.

Complementarity with associated technical assistance projects. While the ongoing \nTA attached to the MDP (footnote 5) helps implement key policy actions in the MDP to a \nsuccessful  result,  capacity  development  TA  approved  in  June  2013  (footnote  6)  aims  to \nstrengthen  microfinance  sector  operations  and  supervision  through  training  to  financial \ninstitutions and supervisory agencies.

Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $720,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  SBV will be the executing agency. Through successful implementation of the MDP and \nrelated  projects  since  2009,  the  institutional,  organizational,  procurement,  and  financial \nmanagement capacities of the SBV have been proven satisfactory. A steering committee, which \nis identical to the MDP steering committee, will provide general policy direction and overall \ncoordination in implementing the TA. The SBV will establish a project management unit to \nprovide technical support to the steering committee. The Banking Academy, the Cooperative \nBank, the Credit Information Center, the Ministry of Finance, PCFs and VBSP will be the \nimplementing agencies. The TA will begin in March 2014 and be implemented over 24 months \nto end in March 2016. \n \n17.
