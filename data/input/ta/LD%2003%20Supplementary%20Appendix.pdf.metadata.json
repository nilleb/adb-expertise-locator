Objectives. The objective of these overseas training modules is for the participants to \nreceive on-site training on fundamental road safety activities in Japan. In this context, Myanmar \ncan learn in multiple areas such as, basics of road safety, traffic engineering, traffic signal setting, \nimprovement of intersection capacity through enforcement tools, rotary (round-about) safety, \nmannerly driver behavior, fundamental curriculum of driver schools, driver training. \n \n2.    Japan  and  Myanmar  similar  features  in  road  safety  context. As  Japan  is  the  only \ndeveloped country in Asia that allows both left and right hand driven vehicles on road, while \nmajority of vehicles are right hand driven. Here, the traffic is on left hand side of the road. \nMyanmar, which has a large proportion of right hand driven vehicles imported from Japan without \nany modification, there are left hand driven vehicles as well. Though this mix of vehicles is similar \nto Japan, Myanmar\u2019s traffic runs on right hand side. Therefore, receiving training focus areas \nmentioned in para 1 is important for Myanmar. Apart from this, Japan has been implementing safe \nschool zone (SSZ) by volunteers, which will be a key area to learn from, and to be adopted in \nMyanmar. An analysis to support these learning advantages is in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Analysis of Learning Advantages of Training in Japan \nRoad safety related \nareas of focus  Comparative learning advantages \nFindings of MYA similarities with JPN \nLegally allowed driver wheel on both LHS and RHS of vehicle \n \nDriver phycology relatively calm and less arrogant with forgiving attitude \n \nDriver attitude seems to have overall respect to law and enforcement \n \nTendency of drivers to alert others with possible merging/lane discipline conflicts seems mannerly; not \nannoying \ndriver school training  Driver school concept is currently not solidly established in MYA thus JPN \n  experience of attention to detail in driver education, including the importance \n  of first aid, is deemed advantages for MYA to consider in establishing a solid \n  foundation for a sustainable road safety regime \n   \nsimple enforcement  Urban intersection capacity may enhanced by simple enforcement techniques \ntechniques by police  JPN police adopts for discouraging vehicles between two signal phases; also \n  for protecting pedestrian safety; and further for anti-jay walking   \n   \nsignalized intersection  Concept of signal cycle and its relationship to congestion or saturation at each \nsetting for signal  arm of intersection is a fundamental concept MYA needs to adopt \nphases   \n   \nsafety of traffic signals  JPN\u2019s advocacy for not adopting unsafe rotaries is another fundamental \nvs. rotary  principle to learn from whereas MYA is heavily biased on uncontrolled rotaries \n  in even urban settings with high traffic volumes  \n   \neffective speed limits  JPN\u2019s high priority for safety more than any other factor for national highways \nfor safety  in suburban or rural settings may be considered a key factor, especially given \n  MYA\u2019s corresponding environment has diverse traffic, including animals \n   \nexpressway safety and  relationship between strict road maintenance standards and highspeed driving \nenforcement  risks, and the importance of patrolling by unmarked police vehicles/motor cycle \n  squad are recommended for consideration for adoption in MYA ", "2  Supplementary Appendix \n \nRoad safety related \nareas of focus  Comparative learning advantages \nsuccessful  SSZ  safety for minors in suburban areas they mainly commute by walking, bicycles, \nimplementation  and occasionally with parent drop offs are successful examples from JPN, \n  where volunteering parents, with inclusiveness of women participation, are key \n  elements for sustainability in community based road safety for MYA \n   \npostwar  approach  for  about 40 year-old systematic efforts that post-war JPN adopted to make the \nroad safety in JPN  road network safe with engineering, education, and enforcement may be a \n  successful Asian example deemed appropriate for MYA to learn from \nNote: JPN=Japan; LHS=left hand side; MYA=Myanmar; RHS=right hand side; SSZ=safe school zone \n \n3.  Once the training has been completed for each module, the participants are expected to \ntrain other potential candidate trainers, of their respective institutions, after completing each \nmodule of training. The training modules are timewise spaced apart to facilitate in-country \ndissemination of information and to conduct training of the trainers. \n \n4.  Focus areas for training. Focus areas of training modules are, but not limited to, basics \nof road safety, traffic engineering, traffic signal setting, improvement of intersection capacity \nthrough enforcement tools, rotary safety, mannerly driver behavior, fundamental curriculum of \ndriver schools, driver training, SSZ implementation, effective police enforcement in expressways \nand national roads, fundamentals of traffic police training, examples of safe guidance of road \nusers, and road user safety in construction sites. \n \n5.   Module 1: Japan. It is proposed to implement the program over a period of about a week, \nand the content of the program should be discussed with ADB and approved before actual \nimplementation. A local service provider needs to be selected to deliver the program. All materials \nand content of lectures should be complied in a memory stick to be distributed to participants. \nThe international training specialist should draft the training of the training program that has to be \nconducted  after  the  participants  return  to  Myanmar  and  receive  ADB  comments  before \nimplementing the training. \n \nTable 2: Proposed Outline of Training in Japan \nDay  Training activity  Remarks \n1  Participants  arrive  in  Haneda,  Tokyo  from  Yangon;  travel  to   \nSun  accommodation \n2  Introduction to training module   \nMon  Full day classroom lectures on: Japan\u2019s brief history of road safety \nactivities after World War II; current situation on road traffic crashes \nSafety standards of vehicles \nJapanese society\u2019s approach for good road user manners \n3  Field visit to driver learning school (private sector)   \nTue  Information on the process of obtaining license: from classroom lessons \nto practical training in school, and on actual roads; time and cost \ninvolved \n4  Field visit to a police station/s  Some participants are \nWed  Short lecture on the role of traffic police enforcement officer: skill  from national police of \nrequirements on traffic engineering, law, mannerly and efficient driving   Myanmar \nVideo  demonstration  by  police  on  practical  and  simple  steps  of \nenforcement  actions,  one  on  national  highways,  another  on \nexpressways ", "    Supplementary Appendix  3 \n \nDay  Training activity  Remarks \n5  Field visit to national highway within Tokyo Metropolitan area (3 lanes   \nThu  in one direction) \nOnsite briefing on: signal cycle setting; safety at intersections for better \ncapacity; safety engineering provisions of guard rails, lane markings, \nsigns, delineators; good road user manners \nField visit to national highway of suburban Tokyo (1 lanes in one \ndirection) \nOnsite briefing on: - same as for urban case above -  \n6  Field visit to safe school zone (SSZ) in suburban Tokyo   \nFri  Onsite briefing on: SSZ implementation; how students are guided for \nwalking, cycling; role of volunteers  \n7  Wrap up for Training   \nSat  Short lecture on summary of training and discussion \nDistribution of training completion certificate by GOJ/JICA officials (if \nfeasible, if not, by training provider) \nEvaluation of training by participants \n8  Participants leave for Haneda airport, Tokyo; depart for Yangon   \nSun \n \n6.   Module 2: Training in Myanmar: Nay Pyi Taw, Yangon, and Mandalay. It is proposed \nto implement this proposed training over 7 days, irrespective of Saturdays and Sundays. The \nsame service provider who delivered the Module 1 will be expected to travel to Myanmar to deliver \nthe Module 2 training. Therefore, the international training specialist needs to carefully design the \ntwo modules that a smooth, objective, and seamless training may be delivered to the participants. \nA thorough consultation with ADB is necessary during training design.    \n \nTable 3: Proposed Outline of Training in Myanmar: Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw, and Mandalay \nDay  Training activity  Remarks \n1  Participants/service provider arrive in Yangon   \nSun \n2  Introduction to training module with half day classroom lectures on   \nMon  subjects learned in Japan as recap \n3  Field exercises/training on signalized intersections and uncontrolled  Urban infrastructure \nTue  rotaries for more efficiency; road-user behavior-based potential safety  but high traffic \nmeasures for increasing road capacity  volumes \n4  Travel to Nay Pyi Taw   \nWed \n5  Field exercises/training for designing road-user behavior-based safety  Urban infrastructure \nThu  measures for an emerging city  but low traffic volumes \n6  Travel to Mandalay   \nFri \n7  Training in Mandalay: low-cost engineering measures that may be  Urban infrastructure \nSat  proposed to enhance Mandalay city   but low traffic volumes \n8  Field exercises/training for designing road-user behavior-based safety   \nSun  measures for an emerging city \n9  Participants/service provider depart Mandalay   \nMon \n ", "4  Supplementary Appendix \n \n7.  Selection of Trainees. The consultants, in close consultation with ADB, will select a long \nlist of candidates. This selection will be from the submission of candidates by the related \ngovernment  agencies  (Ministry  of  Construction,  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communication, \nNational Police, etc.) at the request of ADB. Based on a criterion that focus on: relevance to actual \noperations for road safety, past performance in the field, academic qualifications, future prospects \nof decision making as well as training-the-trainer capabilities, and dedication, the candidates will \nbe shortlisted with a balanced coverage of all agencies. The final shortlist will be a maximum of \n15 participants. All these 15 participants are expected to join all 2 training modules as this training \nmodules are carefully planned to provide systematic understanding of the focus areas.    \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "ADB", "Company": "Licenced User", "CreationDate": "D:20181205173326+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 17 for Word", "Keywords": "adb technical assistance ta report", "ModDate": "D:20181205173328+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 15.0", "SourceModified": "", "Title": "Technical Assistance Report"}}
