The Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) of the Government of Viet Nam for \n2006\u20132010 emphasizes the importance of private sector development for economic growth, \ncreation of employment, income and fiscal revenue generation, and poverty reduction.1 The \nSEDP calls for development of private enterprises of all sizes as well as the removal of barriers \nto their entry and expansion. In response to the Government\u2019s development agenda, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country strategy and program (CSP) for 2007\u201320102, as well as the \nprevious CSP, envisage operations aimed at creating an environment conducive to the growth \nof private businesses in Viet Nam, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.  \n \n2.  In line with this priority, ADB has been implementing the Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprise (SME) Development Program Loan (SDPL) cluster in partnership with the French \nDevelopment Agency (AFD) and German development assistance through the Reconstruction \nCredit Institute (KfW).3 The SDPL\u2019s main objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to \nimprove  the  business  environment  for  SMEs  in  2004\u20132008.  The  first  SDPL  cluster  is \naddressing: (i) establishment of a policy framework for SME development, including institutional \ncoordination  mechanisms;  (ii)  reform  of  business  registration  and  licensing  systems;  and  \n(iii) specific reforms to enhance SMEs\u2019 access to land, finance, and technologies.  \n \n3.  Private sector development has progressed significantly during the SDPL period. The \nWorld Bank\u2019s annual doing business reports noted that the time required to complete all formal \nprocedures for business start-ups dropped from 63 days in 2004 to 56 days in 2005 and to 50 \ndays in 2006. The number of registered enterprises increased from 122,721 in 2003 to 200,000 \nby August 2006, and these businesses account for one third of the country\u2019s manufacturing \nproduction. The private sector\u2019s share of gross investment increased from 32% in 2004 to 33% \nin 2005.   \n \n4.  A key outcome of the first SDPL cluster was the Government\u2019s 5-year SME development \nplan for 2006\u20132010. This contains major policy actions and reforms aimed at the \u201ccreation of a \nsound policy, legal, and institutional environment that ensures fair and healthy competition for \nSMEs and service providers of all economic sectors\u201d.4 In order to build on the achievements of \nthe first cluster, the proposed project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will formulate a \nmedium-term policy framework for possible ADB support of a second SDPL that will address \nreforms  during  the  remaining  period  of  the  SME  development  plan. 5  By  supporting \nimplementation of the policy actions and reforms in the SME development plan and other \nreforms, the second SDPL is expected to contribute to poverty reduction by enabling inclusive \n                                                 \n1  Government of Viet Nam. 2006.

The proposed technical assistance (TA) is listed in the pipeline for nonlending \nproducts and services of the CSP and the country operations business plan (COBP).6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Reforms to promote the transition to a market economy and private sector development \nhave accelerated in recent years. The private sector now accounts for over 60% of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  and  90%  of  employment,  including  farm  households.7 The  2000 \nEnterprise Law, which established citizens\u2019 rights to launch and operate private businesses, \nsignificantly streamlined the enterprise registration process and led to a substantial increase in \nthe number of formal enterprises. Private investment increased from 12% of GDP in 2000 to \n17% in 2005. Foreign direct investment also increased, reaching $10.2 billion in 2006.8 The \ncountry\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007 and the implementation of \nthe Unified Enterprise Law and the Common Investment Law\u2014which are designed to ensure \nthat private, state-owned, domestic, and foreign businesses are treated equally\u2014are expected \nto stimulate private business growth further in the coming years.  \n \n6.  Nevertheless, there are a relatively small number of medium-sized enterprises in Viet \nNam. Most enterprises are large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), foreign-owned companies, \nsmall  domestic  household  businesses,  or  new  start-ups.  The  difficulty  that  small  domestic \nbusinesses have in progressing to medium-sized enterprises underscores to the need to act on \nmarket-oriented reforms.  \n \nA.  Binding Constraints on Businesses  \n1.  Access to Finance and Other Constraints  \n \n7.  The latest Investment Climate Survey (ICS), conducted by the General Statistics Office \nin 2006, polled SMEs in every province on their perceptions of the main constraints to business \ndevelopment. Preliminary findings included lack of access to finance and land, uncertainty about \nregulatory policies, poor infrastructure, and the burden from taxes. Among these perceived \nconstraints, access to finance has been ranked top, particularly among domestic enterprises. A \nsimilar finding emerged from the previous ICS, which had also illustrated that the share of \nenterprises answering the financing bottleneck as the most serious constraint was higher than \nthe East Asian and global averages. \n \n8.  Access to finance is closely linked to collateral, often in the form of land use rights \ncertificates and other property, and is hence related to lack of access to land. While the 2004 \nLand Law established rights in relation to agricultural and residential land, it did not clearly \naddress the release to the market of industrial and commercial land currently occupied by SOEs. \nThe legal framework governing bankruptcy and insolvency, including the Civil Law, needs to be \nassessed as it does not appear to be facilitating the restructuring of SOEs and state-owned \ncommercial banks or the release of their land and other properties for use by private businesses. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

However, it may not be an immediate solution to long-term financing \nneeds of small and household enterprises. Apart from the Government\u2019s efforts to establish and \nsecure property rights, ongoing moves by banks to establish a private credit bureau and the \ndevelopment of the private leasing industry are more promising ways of broadening SMEs\u2019 \naccess to finance.  \n \n2.  Diversity in Business Environments  \n \n10.  The ICS and other surveys highlight the diverse perceptions of constraints and business-\nfriendliness among enterprises in different provinces. For instance, several provincial authorities \nreported that it was difficult to meet the target of completing business registration within 15 days \nand to comply with the ban on issuing licenses at the local level, both of which are important \nelements of the Enterprise Law. Implementation of reforms at the local level is another important \naspect of private sector development.  \n \nB.  Implementation of the 5-Year SME Development Plan \n \n11.  The Government\u2019s 5-year SME development plan includes a comprehensive matrix of \nseven groups of policy actions: (i) simplifying administrative procedures to facilitate SMEs\u2019 \nbusiness registration, market entry, and business activities; (ii) facilitating access to land and \nproduction  premises  for  SMEs;  (iii)  facilitating  access  to  finance  for  SMEs;  (iv)  increasing \ncompetitiveness of SMEs; (v) developing a skilled labor force9 capable of supporting SME \ndevelopment; (vi) creating favorable social attitudes toward the SME sector; and (vii) managing \nimplementation of the SME development plan. These groups are subdivided into 15 policy \nmeasures, which are in turn translated into actions assigned to specific government ministries \nand agencies. These actions are designed to be monitored against indicators and a timetable \nfor their completion has been established.  \n \n12.  The plan indicates the Government\u2019s clear attempt to address constraints on business. \nMost actions have been either completed or are being implemented in partnership with ADB \nthrough the first SDPL cluster and with other development partners. However, implementation of \nactions scheduled for the SDPL\u2019s final years (2008\u20132010) has not yet begun. Some need \nspecific policy instruments and immediate policy targets to be articulated. Others may need to \nbe  adjusted  on  account  of  Viet  Nam's  accession  to  the  multilateral  trading  system,  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s WTO action plan. A focus on private sector development in \nthe context of a more competitive investment climate and greater prospects for international and \ndomestic trade is needed.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  PPTA  will  formulate  a  policy  framework  covering  2008\u20132010  to  improve  the \nbusiness  environment  and  support  SME  growth.  The  framework  will  be  anchored  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s 5-year SME development plan and will be based on: (i) a review of the impacts of \nthe first SDPL cluster, and (ii) an assessment of constraints to private enterprise growth. On the \nbasis of this analysis, a prioritized plan of action will be incorporated into the second SDPL\u2019s \n                                                 \n9  The severe shortage of skilled workers in Viet Nam is addressed in ADB\u2019s COBP 2008\u20132010, which lists a skills \ndevelopment project in its indicative assistance pipeline.

The  plan  of  action  will  continue  the  first  SDPL\u2019s  focus  on  business  environment \nimprovement as opposed to targeted support to SMEs.10  \n \n14.  First SDPL Cluster Assessment and Validation of Continued Support. The PPTA \nwill review the development impacts of the first SDPL\u2019s reforms. Several issues covered in the \nGovernment\u2019s 5-year SME development plan and identified as constraints in the ICSs were \naddressed under the first SDPL: property rights were improved, including land registration and \nsecured  transactions;  accounting  reforms  were  carried  out;  and  the  leasing  sector  was \nstrengthened. The effectiveness of these reforms will be reviewed.  \n \n15.  Articulation of Policy Instruments to Address Binding Constraints. The PPTA will \ncarry out a further analysis of the private sector growth constraints identified in the ICS. A \ndecision tree analysis will be undertaken to articulate sound policy measures to remove or \nalleviate  key  obstacles.  The  analysis  will  be  undertaken  in  close  consultation  with  the \nGovernment, private sector entities, and development partners. Efforts will be made to ensure \nthat stakeholder consultations and surveys reflect broad perspectives on economy-wide benefits \nas opposed to the narrow interests of segments of the business community. The PPTA will also \nidentify  measures  to  enhance  gains  from  trade,  such  as  trade  facilitation,11 as  well  as \nimplementation of the Government\u2019s WTO action plan. \n16.  Review of the 5-Year SME Development Plan. The PPTA will review the policy actions \nin the Government\u2019s 5-year SME development plan for 2006\u20132010, focusing on (i) business \nregistrations and post-registration management, (ii) business-related legislation, (iii) property \nrights, (iv) accounting and financial reporting, (v) taxation and related regulations, (vi) technical \nregulation and standards, and (vii) management of the SME development plan\u2019s implementation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The PPTA activities will focus on preparing a medium-term policy framework for private \nsector development. Consultants with expertise in private sector development and related \nareas  will  work  with  government  counterparts  and  other  stakeholders  during  organized \ndiscussions. Consultations may also occur through conferences or seminars on key policy \nissues. \n \n18.  Consultants will also maintain close contact with development partners represented in \nHanoi-based SME working group meetings. Feedback from the private sector will include \nparticipation in key events and conferences, including the Viet Nam Business Forum. When \nrequired,  consultants  will  directly  engage  a  competent  research  institute  or  a  business \nassociation to undertake supplementary surveys on business development constraints.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent through \ncounterpart staff, office space, administrative services, and physical facilities. The Government \nhas been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nThe cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n                                                 \n10 The program title may change during loan preparation to one that explicitly features the proposed approach.  \n11 Where possible, customs modernization will be addressed in the context of related initiatives for trade and transport \nfacilitation under the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program.  \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  To facilitate implementation of the PPTA, the existing SDPL steering committee will \noversee its implementation. The committee is headed by the vice minister of the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, which is designated as the Executing Agency.12 The implementing \nagencies include the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Justice, \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of Science and Technology, and the \nState Bank of Vietnam.  \n \n21.  The PPTA will be implemented over a 22-month period from March 2008 to December \n2009. Over the course of its implementation, 10 person-months of international consultants and \n12  person-months  of  national  consultants  will  be  required.  Consultants  will  be  recruited \nintermittently  on  an  individual  basis,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  While  the  international  private  sector \ndevelopment  specialist will  coordinate  field  work  by  other  consultants,  ADB\u2019s  project  team \nleader will directly lead policy dialogues with the Government based on the consultants\u2019 outputs. \nThe consultant team will produce inception, interim, draft final, and final reports. The final report, \nincorporating comments from the Government and ADB, will be submitted when the team of \nconsultants completes its services. Terms of reference are outlined in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise \nDevelopment Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12 As requested by the Executing Agency, no TA funds will be channeled through the Government. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nThe ensuing second  Private domestic  Economic reports and official  \u2022  Continued political \nSDPL will establish a  investment increases to  statistics of the Government,  commitment to reforms \nmore enabling business  35% of GDP in 2010 (from  private sector organizations, and  by the Government, and \nenvironment in Viet Nam  29.8% in 2001\u20132005).  international development  sustained coordination \nto enhance economic    agencies  \u2022  The Government is \nwelfare in a manner  The number of enterprises    better able to improve \nconducive to private  registered under  ADB staff assessments  and implement business \nsector development.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe \nhow the project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty \nreduction strategy of the partner country. \nThe SEDP of the Government of Viet Nam for 2006\u20132010 emphasizes the importance of private sector development for \neconomic growth, creation of employment, income and fiscal revenue generation, and poverty reduction. The SEDP \ncalls for the development of private enterprises of all sizes and removal of barriers to their business entry and expansion. \nIn response to the Government\u2019s development agenda, a series of CSPs since 2002 envisaged operations aimed at \ncreating a business-enabling environment conducive to growth of private enterprises, particularly those of small and \nmedium sizes. In particular, the poverty assessment in the latest CSP for 2007\u20132010 endorsed the contribution of \neconomic growth to poverty reduction, with particular attention to roles of SMEs and associated job creation in the \nindustry and service sectors.1  \n \n \nThe second SDPL will support the Government\u2019s initiatives to create a more enabling business environment, such as \nimplementation of the Unified Enterprise Law aimed at reform in registration and licensing procedures. In the medium \nterm, resulting competition among enterprises is expected to stimulate the economy\u2019s overall productivity, raising the \npotential growth rate. A rise in business start-ups may also create new employment opportunities. Since the early 1990s, \nsustained overall economic growth and private sector-led employment generation have actually been major contributors \nto a sharp decline in poverty in Viet Nam, where a strong correlation has been empirically observed between a rise in \nper capita gross domestic product and poverty reduction, and the second SDPL will help sustain this trend from the \nbusiness environment perspective.2  \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe SDPL reduces poverty in an indirect manner through creation of a more enabling business environment that may \ncontribute to pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance.   \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \nSpecial attention will be paid to possible impacts on SMEs representing the poor in the broader business community. \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \nThe second SDPL is not a targeted intervention. At the initial poverty and social analysis stage, no specific indigenous \npersons, gender, relocation, or other social issues have been identified. A summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy will be prepared. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Viet Nam (2007\u20132010).

If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-\npoor governance, and pro-poor growth)? \nWhile the second SDPL does not accord targeted preferential support to any specific business entity, regardless of its \nsize and ownership, its approach aimed at broad-based improvement of Viet Nam\u2019s business environment should entail \na potential for pro-poor growth, as evidenced by several empirical cross-country studies. For instance, relatively \nbusiness-friendly countries are achieving a higher level of human development.3 Surveys conducted among the poor in \n50  countries  reveal  that  a  majority  perceives  starting  a  business  as  an  effective  way  out  of  poverty,  and  the \nunemployment rate is lower in countries where doing business is less difficult.4 \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \nThrough facilitating Viet Nam\u2019s transition to a market economy, the SDPL will introduce wider choices and more \ncompetitive prices to consumers and will enable more efficient utilization of the country\u2019s production capacity through \nimproved resource allocation. Both combined will enhance static economic welfare. In the medium term, there could be \ndynamic gains of improved productivity that may be stimulated through enterprises\u2019 exposure to competition and ease of \nbusiness\u2014as confirmed by cross-country evidence showing that there is a positive correlation between ease in \nprocedures to start up a business and productivity5\u2014and resulting contribution to economic growth. As such, while the \ninitial gains will accrue to consumers and producers who can take immediate advantage of market competition, the rest \nof the economy is also expected to become better off in the medium to long term, depending on the pace of price \nadjustments and reallocation of factors of production.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nPerfect information is a prerequisite for any beneficiary\u2014both consumers and producers\u2014to gain from the improved \nbusiness environment.  \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \nPotential constraints on accessing the proposed benefits include policy-induced rigidity in factor markets, prices, and \nasymmetric information, all of which will be reviewed in the course of the second SDPL\u2019s preparation.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nBusiness enterprises operating in Viet Nam \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \nCollective consultation with the business associations representing enterprises operating in Viet Nam, such as the Viet \nNam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ADB has also been actively participating in the Viet Nam Business Forum, \nand will maintain close contact with the secretariat.  \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nADB has already started stakeholder consultations with the Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Viet Nam \nBusiness Forum, and other business circles through fact-finding for the PPTA and during other occasions under the \nSDPL framework that are planned to be undertaken continuously at the stage of the second SDPL\u2019s formulation.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2005.

What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nThe proposed design of the second SDPL\u2019s subprogram indicates that there will be no negative impact on women.  \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe second SDPL is aimed at establishing an equal environment for all enterprises, as opposed to provision of targeted \nsupport to any commercial entities.  \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe second SDPL is aimed at establishing a nondiscriminatory environment for all enterprises.  \nIII.
