THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Rationale for series of ensuing projects. The greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) \nregion is one of the core industrial areas in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 It generates \nnearly  one-third  of  the PRC\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  and  is  home to  27%  of the  PRC\u2019s \npopulation.  It  consistently  experiences  poor  air  quality2 caused  by  the  region\u2019s  excessive \nreliance  on  coal  in  the  energy  mix,  high  concentration  of  energy  and  pollution-intensive \nindustrial enterprises, large number of cars and vehicles, and weak environmental standards \nand governance.3 For the same reasons, the greater BTH region is also responsible for about \n40% of the country\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions, the most abundant greenhouse gas \n2\ncontributing to climate change. Air pollution emergencies are frequent occurrence in many cities \nof the region.4 Ambient air pollution poses severe health risks and contributes to about 1.2 to \n2.0 million premature deaths annually in the PRC, of which a disproportionately large number of \nthem in the greater BTH region. It also causes productivity losses for the national economy \nestimated to amount up to $300 billion per year.5  \n \n2.  The measures by the Government of the PRC detailed in its Comprehensive Action Plan \nfor Air Pollution Prevention and Control (CAAP) 2013\u20132017, which when adopted in 2013 \nintroduced stringent  air  quality  measures.  These  measures  were  aimed  at  rolling  back  air \npollution  by  setting  specific  emissions  targets  on  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  particulate \nmatter  less  than  2.5  microns  in  diameter  (PM )  or  less  in  diameter  and  volatile  organic \n2.5\ncompounds nationally, and especially for the greater BTH region.6 To date, the government\u2019s \nactions have helped to improve air quality on average.7 The air quality in the region is still far \nbelow  the  national  and  the  World  Health  Organization  standards.8 Due  to  its  important \ncontribution to the country\u2019s CO  emissions, the BTH region is a common top priority under both \n2\nthe air quality and climate change policy goals. The PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020, also reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to accelerate air quality improvement.9 It \nsets ambitious targets for air quality progress, requiring hundreds of cities to meet \u201cgood\u201d or \n\u201cexcellent\u201d standards 80% of the time and to reduce by 25% the number of polluted days, and to \n                                                 \n1  The greater BTH region comprises Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, \nShandong, and Shanxi as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.  \n2  Air quality index (AQI) is a common measure to capture quality of air and potential health impacts. AQI includes \nconsideration of six atmospheric pollutants namely sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, PM , carbon monoxide, \n) ) 2.5\nozone, and particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter In the PRC, the AQI varies from 50 (excellent) to \n.\n500 (severe pollution). \n3  Coal use accounts for about 50% of air pollution in the region, and is the crux of the PRC government\u2019s air pollution \nand CO  emissions problems. The industry has been identified as a critical sector for intervention as it is estimated \n2\nthat 54% of PM  is attributable to the industrial sector within the greater BTH region.  \n2.5\n4  In December 2015, the first \u201cred alert\u201d was issued for Beijing. The AQI threshold for red alert is >500 for one day or \n>300 for two successive days or >200 for four successive days.  \n5  The World Bank and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation University of Washington. 2016. The Cost of Air \nPollution. Washington, DC.  \n6  CAAP aims to cut the level of fine particulate matter in the greater BTH region by 25%\u201330%. Annual average \nconcentration of PM  in the greater BTH region declined by 9.8% in 2014 and 21.3% in 2015, compared to the \n2.5\n2013 level.  \n7  With the results in air quality improvement achieved since the implementation of the CAAP between 2013 and \n2016, it is estimated that by the end of 2017, key air pollutant levels of would have declined in the greater BTH \nregion PM (by 32%), sulfur dioxide(by 21%), nitrogen oxides(by 24%), and volatile organic compounds (by 6%).    \n2.5     \n8  The PRC standard for PM  concentration is 35 microgram per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), compared with 10\u00b5g/m3 for \n2.5\nthe World Health Organization (WHO). In 2015, the region\u2019s annual average PM concentration was 66 \u00b5g/m3.  \n2.5 \n9  State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016.

The plan includes, for \n2.5\nthe first time, a total energy consumption cap, set at 5 billion tons of carbon equivalent. \n3. The CAAP and low-carbon development efforts are part of the government\u2019s wider goals.\nThe  13th  plan  period  marks  the  entry  into  the  \u201cnew  normal\u201d  of  transformative  change  in \ndevelopment strategy, which (i) shifts the drivers of growth from focusing on the quantity of \ninputs, including environmental inputs, to their efficiency; (ii) focuses on the transformation of \nindustrial  production  methods,  a  fundamental  restructuring  of  the  energy  sector;  and  (iii) \ncultivates new growth points and competitive advantages driven by advanced technologies. The \ngovernment\u2019s  goal  is  to  attain  an  ecological  civilization  in  line  with  the  United  Nations \nSustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement. Key levers identified by the \ngovernment to drive the PRC\u2019s green development are (i) advanced, innovative technologies, \nwhich will transform the industry to adopt clean production methods; (ii) green finance; and (iii) \npolicy  reforms.  The  PRC\u2019s  high  ambitions  on  advancing  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment will lead to an unprecedented demand for financing. The government\u2019s green \nfinancing task force estimated those needs to range between CNY14.5 trillion and CNY29.8 \ntrillion up to 2020.10 The CAAP targets alone will require CNY1.8 trillion in investment, and \nCNY250 billion within the greater BTH region. In addition, about CNY6.6 trillion in investments \nwill be required to meet low carbon and clean energy targets in the 13th plan, of which only \n10%\u201315% can be realistically financed with public funds.11  \n4. The speed of \u201cgreening\u201d of the economy has to overcome significant uncertainties,\nchallenges,  and  barriers.  The  speed  of  this  transformation  will  depend  on  the  (i)  policy \nframework the government sets, particularly in terms of regulations, their enforcement, and \nfiscal and financial support schemes for the private sector to invest in emission control and \npollution-reduction projects; (ii) availability and scale of deployment of advanced technologies\u2014\nmany  emission  reduction  technologies  have  been  pilot  tested,  but  not  demonstrated  and \ndeployed;  and  (iii)  availability  of  adequate  financing.  In  September  2016,  the  government \nestablished it\u2019s Guidelines for Establishing the Green Financial System, but major barriers \npersist.12 On the supply side, key challenges include (i) insufficient information flow on new \ntechnologies, (ii) lack of capacity on the side of financial intermediaries in appraising advanced \ntechnologies, and (iii) reluctance to invest in new project types. On the demand side, there is \nstill a lack of sufficient, and well-developed green projects.  \n5. Programmatic  approach  to  national  priority.  The  government  has  requested  the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in 2015 to adopt a programmatic approach to address this \nnational priority and assist pertaining challenges (para. 4). The first loan, approved in 2015, \nfocused on policy reforms in Hebei province;13 the second, approved in 2016, emphasized \nimproving access to finance for investment in green energy and pollution-reduction projects in \nthe greater BTH region through the establishment of a Green Financing Platform.14 The lending \nprogram (2016\u20132020) is anchored on three key areas: (i) enhancing policy and regulation for \nadvancing  the  government\u2019s  air  quality  and  sustainable  development  objectives;  (ii) \n10 China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. 2016.

Ensuing  projects.  The  forthcoming  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019\nfinalized in consultation with the government and key stakeholders, include lending projects of \n$500 million per year. These lending projects indicatively comprise the (i) Emission Control and \nPollution Reduction Fund of the China Energy Conservation and Environment Protection Group \n(CECEP), (ii) policy reforms and results-based program in strategically selected provinces in the \ngreater  BTH  region,  and  (iii)  scaling-up  for  China  National  Investment  and  Guaranty \nCorporation\u2019s Green Financing Platform Project. The upcoming loans will use the financial \nintermediation loan, results-based and policy-based loan modalities, and will all require similar \npolicy analysis and technical, financial, economic, environment, poverty, social, governance, \nand  legal  and  regulatory  due  diligence.  ADB  lending  support  each  year  will  be  mutually \nreinforcing and will be backed up by analytical, policy advisory, and capacity development \nnonlending work\u2014many of which are already in progress. \n7. The proposed projects are fully aligned with the country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020\nfor the PRC.15 The projects prioritize the management of climate change and environment to \nsupport  the  government\u2019s  priorities  in  realizing  an  ecological  civilization  and  the  strategic \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.16 \n8. Transaction  technical  assistance  facility  and  justifications.  The  proposed\ntransaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation, capacity building, \nand policy advisory assistance for a multiyear lending program spanning 2017\u20132019 (para. 6), \nwhich aims at improving air quality and facilitate low-carbon development in the greater BTH \nregion. \n9. As each project is a chain-link in ADB\u2019s programmatic approach and is likely to require\nsimilar due diligence, the TA facility approach is suitable to (i) enhance operational efficiency in \npreparing  the  projects,  (ii)  reap  important  synergies  from  working  with  the  same  team  of \nconsultants, and (iii) strengthen coordination. \nB.

Consulting  service  descriptions.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  following  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For the preparation \nof the loan projects, consultants will be engaged through the TA, using the individual selection \nmethod and output-based partial lump-sum contracts. To prepare a series of loans as planned \nto be supported by this proposed TA facility, which all require the same set of due diligence, \nimportant synergies may be reaped from engaging the same consultants. Since the 2018 and \n2019  loan  projects  have  not  yet  been  fully  conceptualized,  the  engagement  of  individual \nconsultants offers the necessary flexibility in preparing those loan projects. The expertise of the \nconsultants will cover the entire range required to conduct necessary due diligence for the loan \nprojects. In addition, for the complementary policy analysis to facilitate the preparation of the \npolicy and results-based loan, a firm will be engaged using quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod and output-based, partial lump-sum contract. The estimated budget of $400,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund18 under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership  Facility.
