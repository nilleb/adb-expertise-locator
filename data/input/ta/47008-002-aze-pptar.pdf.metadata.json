The main objective of the proposed project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is to \nprepare the Renewable Energy Development (Biomass Cogeneration) Project (the project) and \nassist the executing agency in undertaking advance procurement.  \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The PPTA is necessary on the following grounds:  \na.  The project needs to be prepared in a timely manner to meet the investment needs \nin Azerbaijan.  \nb.  While the government has a plan to invest in the project, there is a need to prepare a \nfeasibility study to undertake due diligence required to process a loan for the project, \nand to prepare tender documents for the procurement.  \nc.  There  is  a  need for  expertise from  a  competent  international  consulting firm to \nprepare  the  project  and  to  assist  the  tender  process,  considering  the  technical \ncomplexity of the project.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n3.  The PPTA is expected to be implemented over an 18-month period starting June 2013 \nwith two phases. In the first phase, the consultants will conduct a detailed feasibility study to \nassess the viability of the proposed renewable energy investment projects, with particular focus \non the fuel flexibility of the conversion technology and the security of affordable biomass supply. \nSubject to the discussions with the government, the identified investment project will be further \ndeveloped and optimized in the second phase with due diligence assessment in accordance \nwith ADB and the government's requirements.
