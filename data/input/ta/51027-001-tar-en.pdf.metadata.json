INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the formulation of a strategy that will \nsimultaneously control air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transport sector. \nThe TA will help the Ministry of Transport (MOT) develop a (i) draft guideline on evaluating the \nco-benefits of policies and measures, and (ii) a strategy for the collaborative control of air pollution \nand GHG emissions, for consideration by the PRC government.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for the PRC.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Because of rapid economic development and urbanization, the PRC has been suffering \nfrom increasingly severe air pollution that occurs more frequently and in wider geographic areas, \nseriously  threatening  public  health  and  causing  domestic  and  international  concerns.  The \ntransport sector is one of the main emission sources of air pollution and GHGs in the PRC. \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s national vehicle fleet reached 279 million in 2015 and is expected to increase \nby about 100 million by 2020. In 2015, nitrogen oxide (NO ) emissions from the transport sector \nx\nreached 5.85 million tons, accounting for about 30% of national NO  emissions.3 Based on a \nx\nsource analysis of particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM ) in nine cities \n2.5  \n(Beijing,  Guangzhou,  Hangzhou,  Nanjing,  Ningbo,  Shanghai,  Shenzhen,  Shijiazhuang,  and \nTianjin), the share of pollutant emissions from mobile sources varies from 15.0% to 52.1% of the \ntotal local emissions of PM .4 \n2.5\n \n4.  At the same time, the PRC has become the world's largest GHG emitter. The transport \nsector is one of the rapidly increasing sources of GHG emissions. According to the PRC report \nsubmitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the carbon dioxide \n(CO ) equivalent emission from the transport sector in 2012 was as high as 797 million tons, \n2\nwhich is much more than the total GHG emissions of all 50 small states (479 million tons of CO  \n2\nequivalent in 2012).5 Controlling GHG emissions in the transport sector is crucial to achieve the \nPRC\u2019s GHG emission mitigation target. \n \n5.  To reduce air pollution and GHG emissions, the PRC government set national targets for \ntheir control. In 2016, the State Council issued the 13th Five-Year Plan for Ecological and \nEnvironmental Protection6 with the following air quality targets: compared with 2015 levels, by \n2020 (i) \u201cgood air quality days\u201d7 must comprise at least 80% of each year, (ii) PM  emissions are \n2.5\nreduced by 18% in cities, and (iii) sulfur dioxide and NO  emissions are reduced by 15%. On the \nx\nGHG mitigation target, the PRC government committed to reduce CO  emissions per gross \n2\ndomestic product by 40%\u201345% by 2020, compared with the 2005 level, and reach CO  emission \n2\npeak around 2030, with a best effort to reach the peak as early as possible, as its commitment \nunder the Paris climate agreement. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 July 2017. \n2  ADB. 2017.

A day when the air quality \nindex is equal to level 1 or 2 is considered a \u201cgood air quality day.\u201d \n ", "2 \n6.  The PRC government has developed and implemented polices and measures to control \nair pollution in the transport sector. In January 2016, the Ministry of Environmental Protection \n(MEP) released the Ordinance on Implementing the Fifth Phase Emission Standards of Vehicle,8 \nwhich required all vehicles made in the PRC or imported from other countries to meet the Guo \nBiao-V (GB-V) national vehicle emission standard during April 2016\u20131 January 2018. In March \n2017, MEP, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Ministry of Finance, \nand the National Energy Administration, together with the municipal and provincial governments \nof Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan, jointly released the Air Pollution Control \nProgram 2017 in Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei and their Surrounding Region.9 The program has strict \nmeasures to control air pollutant emissions from transport and other sectors, including monitoring \nthe pollutant emissions of vehicles, limiting entry of heavy trucks into urban areas, and supplying \nhigh-quality gas and diesel. In April 2017, MOT released the Notice on Implementation Program \non Eco-Civilization Construction in the Transport Sector,10 which requires all vehicles to meet \nnational emission standards when in operation. But these initiatives and measures on pollution \ncontrol in the transport sector do not address GHG emissions. \n \n7.  The PRC government has also developed and implemented many policies and measures \non GHG emission control. In October 2016, the State Council released the Work Program on \nGHG Emission Control during the 13th Five-Year Period,11 which mandates the development of \nlow-carbon and green transport facilities, promotion of electric vehicles, and setting of strict GHG \nemission standards for vehicles. The NDRC initiated the National Plan on Coping with Climate \nChange (2014\u20132020), which includes GHG emission control measures for the transport sector, \nsuch as increasing the share of urban public transport to 30%, increasing transport efficiency to \nreduce GHG emissions per person-kilometer by 5% and per ton-kilometer by 13% of road \ntransport by 2020, and increasing railway transport efficiency to reduce GHG emission intensity \nby 15% by 2020, compared with 2010.12 These emission control initiatives and measures, \nhowever, do not consider air pollutant emissions. \n \n8.  Unintended side effects may be caused by some air pollution control or GHG emissions \nreduction measures and technologies. Electric vehicles may not reduce GHG emissions if the \ncharging electricity is from the low-efficiency coal-based power grid. Vehicle tail gas purifiers and \ndiesel particulate filters can reduce air pollutants but will not reduce GHG emissions. Converting \noil to gas for buses can reduce GHG emissions but buses when fueled with such converting gas \nwill emit more NO . Burning diesel via the internal combustion engines of cargo vehicles is more \nx\npowerful and energy saving, but will increase pollutant emissions. Without good management \nsystems, low-carbon transport modes such as bicycle sharing may produce more waste from \noverproduction and short service lives. Some mitigation policies, technologies, and measures with \ngood pollution and GHG emission reduction co-benefits may have high mitigation costs and may \nnot be adopted if only a single environmental benefit (i.e., only GHG emission reduction or only \npollution reduction) is considered. \n \n                                                \n8  Government of the PRC.

To ensure that the national air pollution control targets and GHG emission mitigation \ncommitments  are  achieved,  the  PRC  government  should  prioritize  the  implementation  of \ntechnologies and measures with significant co-benefits for reducing air pollution and GHG \nemissions. To do so, the PRC government needs to evaluate the impact of GHG emissions when \ndeveloping air pollution control policy and the impact of air pollution emissions when developing \nGHG mitigation policy to avoid those measures that help one aspect but harm another, such as \nreducing GHG emissions but increasing pollution. \n \n10.  The revised PRC Law on Air Pollution Prevention and Control issued in 2015 requires that \npolicies and measures on controlling emissions should consider the co-benefits of reducing air \npollution and GHG emissions, which is the first time the consideration of co-benefits has been \nrequired in a national policy document. This TA will help develop the policies and measures for \ncollaborative control of air pollution and GHG emissions and enhance their co-benefits in the \ntransport sector of the PRC. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: the objectives of controlling  air pollution and \nGHG emissions in the PRC\u2019s transport sector in 2025 achieved.13 The TA will have the following \noutcome: policies on controlling air pollution and GHG emissions in the PRC\u2019s transport sector \nimproved.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Guideline on assessing the co-benefits of policies and measures for \ncontrolling air pollution and GHG emissions in the transport sector drafted. The TA will \nidentify and review available and effective methods of assessing the benefits (including the health \nbenefit) of policies and measures for controlling air pollution and GHG emissions in the transport \nsector (focusing on urban transport and roads), and develop a draft guideline that will include \nassessment and evaluation methods tailored to air pollution and GHG emission control in the \ntransport sector. Specifically, the TA will explore for consideration an applicable evaluation \nmethod to reflect in an integrated way the effects of both air pollution and GHG emissions, and \nprovide a tool to prioritize the consideration and implementation of technologies and measures \nwith significant co-benefits in the transport sector. The TA will also explore partnerships with \nacademic institutions. After the draft guideline is developed, the consultant team will carry out \ncase studies by applying the draft guideline to selected real policies, measures, and technologies \nto verify the applicability and reliability of the methods. The TA will compile international best \npractices with good air pollution and GHG emission reduction co-benefits as a knowledge product. \n \n13.  Output 2: Strategy for enhancing collaborative control of air pollution and GHG \nemissions in the transport sector drafted. Based on output 1, the TA will develop a strategy \nthat will include transport sector development (focusing on urban transport and roads) scenarios \ntoward 2030 in the PRC; the optimization of controlling policies, measures, and technologies; and \nthe implementation plan. The strategy will consider the possibility of incorporating incentive and/or \nmarket mechanisms to promote the implementation of the plan included in the strategy, which will \nbe aimed at supporting the PRC government in achieving the national targets for air pollution and \n                                                \n13 Because of the limited budget, the study will mainly focus on urban transport and roads. \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nGHG emission control. The consultant team will submit the draft strategy to MOT and other line \nministries for review, and then finalize and submit it to MOT for consideration. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The proposed TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Climate Change Fund.15 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time, TA project office, \noffice supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.
