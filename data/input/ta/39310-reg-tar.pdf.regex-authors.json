A key lesson from the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis is that mature bond markets are \ncrucial  for maintaining  a  better  balance  within  financial sectors  and  thus  building  financial \nstability in the region. Regional and national initiatives have focused on removing obstacles to \nbond market development, including inadequate or weak credit rating systems. Since 1987, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has supported Asian domestic credit rating agencies (DCRAs) \nthrough  equity  investments  for  their  establishment.1  DCRAs  can  support  ADB\u2019s  thrust  in \npromoting  infrastructure  development  in  Asia  since  a  better  flow  of  information  stimulates \ngrowth  of  the  sector.  This  growth  can  facilitate  more  domestic  resource  mobilization \nopportunities,  especially  for  infrastructure  development,  as  investors  prefer  to  rely  on  the \nopinion of DCRAs for their decisions. In September 2001, the Association of Credit Rating \nAgencies in Asia (ACRAA) was established to help harmonize credit rating processes for the \ndevelopment of the region\u2019s bond markets. ADB has supported strengthening institutional and \ntechnical capacities of Asian DCRAs through ACRAA activities.2 The ASEAN+3 Asian Bond \nMarkets  Initiative  (ABMI)\u2014endorsed  at  the  meeting  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations (ASEAN)+3 finance ministers in August 2003 to accelerate development of efficient and \nliquid bond markets in the region\u2014established the ABMI Working Group (WG) 4 on Rating \nSystems,  which  ADB  has  supported  with    technical  expertise  on  current  issues  on  rating \nsystems.  \n \n2.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)3  aims  to  continue  ADB\u2019s  support  in  strengthening \ninstitutional and technical capacities of Asian DCRAs, and to further contribute to promoting the \npolicy  dialogue  for  enhancing  the  credibility  and  visibility  of  DCRAs  in  Asia,  especially  in \nfostering \u201ccomparability\u201d among them. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A  major  cause  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  maturity  mismatches  resulting  from \noverreliance  on  short-term  bank  financing  for  long-term  investment,  as  well  as  currency \nmismatches, could have been reduced if well-developed bond markets were an alternative \navenue for channeling the region\u2019s large savings into long-term investments. One of the critical \nrequirements for efficient bond markets is to ensure both issuers and investors can avail of \naccurate informational frameworks\u2014this is on top of contractual frameworks, the regulatory and \nsupervisory frameworks, a diversified investor base, and issuing and trading processes based \non pricing mechanisms.  \n \n4.  Information  asymmetries  prevent  effective  and  efficient  direct  interaction  between \nmultiple savers and investors. Sharing credit information is important to give equal opportunities \nto market participants and foster competition in the financial system. Credit reporting makes a \n                                                 \n1  The first equity investment was for Rs0.6 million ($0.45 million) to Crisil India in 1987, the second was for \nMalaysian ringgit 0.49 million ($0.19 million) to Rating Agency Malaysia in 1990, and the third was for baht 5 \nmillion ($0.2 million) to Thai Rating & Information Service in 1993.  \n2  ADB supported DCRAs through ACRAA\u2019s activities in three regional TAs: (i) ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance \nfor Capacity Building of Selected Credit Rating Agencies in Asia. Manila (TA 6116-REG, for $150,000); (ii) ADB. \n2003. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building of Selected Credit Rating Agencies in Asia, Phase II. Manila \n(TA 6029-REG, for $150,000); and (iii) ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building of Selected Credit \nRating Agencies in Asia Phase III. Manila (TA 6191-REG, for $300,000). Those regional TAs financed and \norganized nine training workshops (basic and advanced courses) and six best-practices dialogues (special \nissues and current business and rating practices that need to be revised, reinforced, or improved). \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 July 2006.  \n ", "2   \ndebtor\u2019s quality much more transparent\u2014benefiting good borrowers and increasing the cost of \ndefaulting on one\u2019s obligations. More accurate and transparent financial statements, based on \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), can help reduce information asymmetries \nbetween debtors and creditors.  \n \n5.  The significance of DCRAs in developing efficient bond markets is their role in building \ninformational frameworks for the financial system.  \n \n(i)  For  investors.  Credit  ratings  support  investment  decisions.  Thus,  effective \nDCRAs are critical for bond market transparency and efficiency as they can \noptimize risk-return profiles for investors, help them monitor portfolios through \nregular surveillance and credit rating adjustments, and provide timely information \nto help in trading and risk management. \n(ii)  For issuers. DCRAs help issuers assess loan risk and raise funds under given \nmarket conditions, and encourage corporations to conform to prudent and best \ncorporate practices. \n(iii)  For  other  financial  intermediaries.  DCRAs  can  provide  other  market \nparticipants  (such  as  commercial  banks)  additional  information  for  risk \nassessment on behalf of clients. \n(iv)  For regulators. Credit rating information can provide financial regulators and \nsecurities  market  supervisors  with  complementary  tools  for  more  efficient \nprudential regulation and supervision. \n \n6.  Twenty-seven DCRAS and 10 subsidiaries of global credit rating agencies (GCRAs) \noperate in ASEAN+3 countries; Taipei,China; and in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  \nDCRAs have a key advantage over the local 100%-owned GCRAs in in-depth knowledge and \nunderstanding of domestic operating environments, corporate climate, business practices, and \nculture. At the same time, DCRAs may have lower operational costs that translate into lower \nrating fees for issuers. However, DCRAs are often perceived as inadequate or are less trusted \nby international and regional investors. The view is that DCRAs are less independent; have \nlower quality analysts and, consequently analysis; and limited experience in ratings because \nthey are confined to domestic economies.   \n \n7.  ACRAA promotes exchange of ideas, experience, information, and skills among its 24 \nmembers so as to improve DCRAs\u2019 credibility and to harmonize credit rating processes. The \nACRAA members list is provided as a supplementary appendix. ACRAA aims to enhance each \ncredit rating agency\u2019s credibility by providing reliable market information, and to promote the \nadoption of best practices and common standards to ensure high quality and comparability of \nratings throughout the region.  \n \n8.  ADB has provided support to build the capacity of DCRAs through ACRAA\u2019s training \nworkshops and best practices dialogues. The training workshops have been conducted at two \nlevels\u2014basic  and  advanced\u2014to  make  the  courses  suitable  for  the  participants\u2019  level  of \nknowledge, skills, and experience. Since June 2002, six basic training workshops and three \nadvanced workshops have been held with more than 220 DCRA staff members participating. \nEvaluations for each workshop are prepared, and outcomes are monitored and assessed by the \nACRAA training committee. ACRAA plans to continue holding two basic workshops and one \nadvanced workshop each year. The best-practices dialogue is a forum where special issues and \ncurrent business and rating practices that need revising, reinforcing, or improving are discussed. \nFollowing the dialogues, DCRAs adopt the recommendations and suggestions in the region. In \n2002, the ACRAA Best Practice Checklist and Code of Ethics were adopted by all members, \n ", "  3\nand in June 2006, the mandatory observance of the Table of Contents of the ACRAA Best- \nPractice Policy Manual,4 and the Action Plan for Harmonization (disclosure and publication of \nkey information)5 was initiated. The long-term agenda for these dialogues is to develop tools for \ncross-agency and cross-border comparison of ratings, and to compile rating methodologies and \ndatabases of all ratings issued by agencies and of regulatory support measures across the \nregulatory environments of DCRAs. \n \n9.  The ASEAN+3 ABMI WG 4 Rating System aims to enhance the credibility and visibility \nof DCRAs in Asia, so as to foster comparability of credit ratings among them. ADB has been \ninteracting with WG4 and has been facilitating policy dialogue by providing technical expertise. \nVigorous  discussion  by  international  regulators  such  as  the  International  Organization  of \nSecurities Commission (IOSCO) and Basel II on the regulatory framework for DCRAs will \nsignificantly affect DCRA fundamental business practices.6 With GCRAs currently dominating \ncross-border rating standardization, fostering DCRA comparability in credit ratings is a first step \ntoward achieving the goal of ABMI WG4. The determinants of comparability and elements of \ncommon standards include the following:  \n \n(i)  Default studies. Encouraging DCRAs to publish or disclose historical default \nrates for the rating symbols they use and to collate data and publish annual \ndefault studies. DCRAs should also clearly outline \u201cdefault\u201d definitions. \n(ii)  Rating policies, methodologies, and practices. Requiring DCRAs to publish \nrating  policies  and  practices.  This  will  encourage  greater  comparability  and \nharmonization among themselves and GCRAs, and align them closer to the \nIOSCO code. It is worthwhile to explore having DCRAs publicly disclose (or \nestablish) selected financial benchmarks\u2014a practice already adopted by GCRAs. \n(iii)  Rating  database  and  disclosures.  Requiring  DCRAs  to  publish  the \ncomponents of their rating database to allow for greater comparison. Each DCRA \nrating database is a function of local market dynamics and varies from one \neconomy to another. \n  \n10.  After the ABMI WG4 meeting in March 2006, the chair countries, Japan and Singapore, \nrequested ADB to provide further support in (i) monitoring changes in the regulatory frameworks \nand requirements of DCRAs in Asia by introducing Basel II and IOSCO principles, and (ii) \nstudying harmonization to enhance comparability in line with ASEAN+3 ABMI WG4. \n \n                                                 \n4  All ACRAA members must comply with general objectives and policies, the enforcement of policies, the policy on \nethical  conduct,  the  policy  on  required  disclosure  of  ownership/capitalization;  board  of  directors  and \nmanagement, credit rating process methodology, and basic rating criteria, the rating committee/rating board; \nfunctions and responsibilities; membership disclosure; qualifications; policy on confidentiality; policy on conflict of \ninterest; publication of ratings; credit rating surveillance/monitoring in the ACRAA Best Practices Policy Manual.  \n5  ACRAA members must publicly disclose information on (i) ratings meanings and definitions by 31 July 2006, \n(ii) policy on assigning rating watch by 31 August 2006, (iii) key methodologies and criteria by 30 September \n2006, (iv) definitions of default by 31 October 2006, and (v) default and transition statistics by 31 December 2006. \n6  A recent ADB study Impact of IOSCO and Basel II to DCRAs in ASEAN+3 Countries, concluded that IOSCO \nprinciples and Basel II guidelines will benefit bond market development in the region by (i) enhancing the \ntransparency and accountability of credit rating methodologies, (ii) creating increased opportunities for using \ncredit ratings provided by DCRAs, and (iii) supporting comparability of credit rating methodologies by introducing \nthe mapping processes of Basel II. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA objective is to assist in strengthening the institutional and technical capacities of \nselected DCRAs in Asia, promoting regional cooperation among Asian DCRAs, and supporting \nthe policy dialogue of ABMI WG4. The TA will support the enhancement of the credibility and \nvisibility of DCRAs in Asia by strengthening their analytical capability, enhancing the disclosure \nof  key  information,  and  adopting  the  best-practice  code  of  conduct.  The  TA  will  increase \ntransparency  and  efficiency  of  bond  markets  by  supporting  prudent  credit  ratings  and \ninstitutional capacity of DCRAs as they adapt to the new IOSCO regulatory framework principles \nand Basel II. The TA will also support harmonization of credit ratings among DCRAs in Asia and \nestablishing comparability with GCRAs by identifying a common standard of rating practices. \nThe TA will facilitate regional financial cooperation, and improve corporate governance and \nfinancial market supervision, which are key components for financial market stability in the \nregion, and thus support key result areas of the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have three components: \n \n(i)  Enhancing  technical  competency  and  institutional  capacity  of  selected \nDCRAs in Asia. The TA will finance the organization and holding of training \nworkshops and best-practices dialogues for staff and management of DCRAs \n(from ACRAA members) from 11 developing member economies:7 Bangladesh; \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; India; Indonesia; Malaysia; Pakistan; Philippines; Sri \nLanka; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Uzbekistan. The ACRAA training workshops \nwill  be  conducted  at  basic  and  advanced  levels  to  adapt  the  courses  to \nparticipants\u2019  level  of  knowledge,  skill,  and  experience.  The  best-practices \ndialogues will discuss special issues and current business and rating practices \nthat require revision, reinforcement, or improvement. Thereafter, the DCRAs will \nadopt the recommendations and suggestions resulting from the consensus of \npeers in the region. The long-term agenda for these dialogues is to develop tools \nfor  comparing  cross-agency  and  cross-border  ratings,  and  to  compile  rating \nmethodologies  and  databases  of  all  ratings  issued  by  agencies  and  the \nregulatory support measures promulgated across the regulatory environments of \nthe participating DCRAs.  \n(ii)  Monitoring and reporting on the status of regulatory frameworks for DCRA \noperations in selected Asian countries. The TA will monitor and report on the \nstatus of the implementation of IOSCO practices and Basel II guidelines by \nregulators in selected Asian countries. It will also monitor and report on the status \nof adopting a code of conduct (based on IOSCO practices) by DCRAs in the \nregion, and the status of each DCRA against guidelines issued by regulators to \nqualify as an external credit assessment institution. The TA will compile the \ninformation and report on the impact of IOSCO practices and Basel II (steps \ntaken by the selected DCRAs for complying with IOSCO Practices and Basel II \nrequirements, along with capacity building). The TA will support the holding of an \n                                                 \n7  No workshops or best-practices dialogues will be organized in Taipei,China. Staff and management of DCRAs of \nTaipei,China will be invited to attend workshops or best-practices dialogues organized for the TA, but the TA will \nnot finance their participation. \n ", "  5\nad hoc forum among ABMI WG4, rating agency security regulators for DCRAs, \nand banking supervisors for Basel II and Asian DCRAs as required.  \n(iii)  Enhancing comparability and harmonization among DCRAs in the region. \nThe TA will explore the feasibility of developing common standards for credit \nrating  and  enhancing  comparability  among  DCRAs.  It  will  analyze  the \ncomparability of the relative ratings of credit by DCRAs and those by GCRAs. \nThe TA will analyze the credit rating methodology of DCRAs to determine the \ncritical  rating  factors  in  identifying  common  rating  practices,  methodologies, \ndatabases, and policies among DCRAs, including specific financial benchmarks, \nrating databases, or other guiding factors used by each DCRA. The TA will also \nconduct a survey to establish the viability of a DCRA\u2019s default study, which is a \nmajor component for developing common standards.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The cost will cover \nremuneration, travel, and per diem for international and national consultants. It will also cover \nthe cost of the training workshops and best-practices dialogues: honoraria and travel expenses \nof resource persons,  hotel accommodation and subsistence allowance of the participants, and \npayment for venue and training materials. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  TA  Executing  Agency  and  OREI  will  implement  the  TA  in  close \ncollaboration with ACRAA. For enhancing technical competency and institutional capacity of \nselected DCRAs in Asia, OREI, jointly with ACRAA, will conceptualize and organize the training \nworkshops and best-practices dialogues, and monitor and review the impact of the planned \nactivities. For the other components of the TA, international and national consultants will be \nengaged. No activities financed under the TA may be held in a developing member country \n(DMC) unless ADB receives a no-objection letter from such DMC. \n \n15.  The TA will require approximately 10 person-months of international and 5 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. The TA will be implemented over 12 months, starting \nJanuary  2007  and  ending  December  2007.  All  consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants (April  2006,  as \namended from time to time). Consultants will be engaged as individual consultants. The scope \nof work and outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  The outline of the \nstudy for the third component, enhancing comparability and harmonization among the DCRAs in \nthe region, is in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nCapacity Building
