INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for a knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) to advance \nresearch and develop policy advice on ways to advance the equitable provision of public services \nand social security transfers in the context of wider fiscal modernization requirements. Specifically, \nthese areas cover (i) the degree of alignment between the PRC\u2019s current tax structure and the \ncountry\u2019s expenditure needs under the high-quality growth model; (ii) the extent to which current \nintergovernmental fiscal arrangements ensure a sufficient and equitable allocation of resources \nacross the different tiers of government, relative to assigned service delivery responsibilities; and \n(iii) inefficiencies in current public financial management systems and processes. Finally, the \nresearch will be used to provide evidence-based policy advice on ways to introduce improvements \nin the analyzed areas. \n \n2.  The  support  will  be  delivered  through  a  combination  of  analytical  work,  policy \nrecommendations, and capacity development activities, including workshops, seminars, and the \nstudy of relevant international experiences in the two reform areas. The TA is included in the \nindicative 2021 PRC nonlending program and will be included in the Indicative Country Pipeline \nand Monitoring report proposed for approval in Q3 2021.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a huge impact on the global \neconomy, including in the PRC. With a 6.8% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) during \nthe first quarter of 2020, the PRC recorded its first negative quarterly growth since 1992, far \nexceeding the impact of the 2008 international financial crisis.2 Driven by the countercyclical \nexpenditure framework that was implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PRC \nrecorded a CNY3.76 trillion fiscal deficit\u2014equivalent to 3.7% of GDP over 2020. Of that deficit, \nCNY2.78 trillion is accounted for by the central government and CNY0.98 trillion by subnational \ngovernments. \n \n4.  With the improvements in pandemic control and the resulting resumption of social and \neconomic activities, the country\u2019s economy has improved significantly after entering the second \nquarter of 2020, and the growth rate of GDP reached 3.2%.3 Notwithstanding this gradual \nrecovery of economic activities, the PRC is still facing serious and structural fiscal management \nchallenges that hamper the full realization of the high-quality growth agenda, and in particular the \neffective, equitable, and efficient provision of public services and social security transfers.4 \n \n5.  The existing fiscal management challenges can be broadly categorized into four areas: (i) \na growing gap in the growth of government revenues and government expenditures (figure); (ii) a \ncurrent tax structure, dominated by indirect taxes, which does not generate the required levels of \nrevenue; (iii) structural vertical and horizontal imbalances in the allocation of resources (and thus, \nthe inequitable provision of services and social security transfers); and (iv) the fragmented \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 July 2021. \n2  O.

In expenditure responsibilities, the PRC is one of the most decentralized countries in the \nworld (subnational governments provide roughly 85% of all public services). As a result, the \ncombined impact of these four challenges on both the quantity and quality of public services \ndelivered by subnational governments has been substantial and negative. \nTrends in Government Expenditure and Revenues \n(CNY million) \n \nNote: Over 2010\u20132018, the fiscal deficit of the People\u2019s Republic of China increased from \u20130.36% of GDP to \u20134.66% of \ngross domestic product.

The research on these identified constraints has previously focused on analyzing the \nindividual constraints separately, instead of in relation to each other. The research has also lacked \nempirical evidence, especially from the subnational level. These have resulted in a prevalence of \npiecemeal policy advice. \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s following operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining \npoverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equity,  and  (iii) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity. The TA is also aligned with the current \ncountry partnership strategy\u2019s objective of strengthening institutions and their capacity to support \nreforms.6 Finally,  the  TA  is  aligned  with  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  10  (reduced \ninequalities) and 16 (peace and strong institutions). \n \n \n5 Vertical fiscal imbalances refer to the mismatch between spending responsibilities that are assigned to lower levels \nof government and the financial resources available to those local governments. Horizontal fiscal imbalances refer \nto fiscal disparities within the same tier of government; horizontal imbalances thus are an equalization concern. The \nPRC\u2019s public financial management system, across the different tiers of government, comprises four separate \nbudgets,  each  with  their own  financial  reporting  and  accounting  practices: the  General  Public  Budget,  the \nGovernment Fund Budget, the Social Security Budget, and the State-Owned Enterprises Budget.  \n6 ADB. 2021.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: equitable provision of public services and \nsocial  security  support  achieved.7 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  policies  for \nmodernizing the fiscal underpinning of public services and social security improved. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Through the TA, support will be provided to assess the critical institutional constraints \nidentified by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in a comprehensive and empirical manner, \nand to provide policy recommendations on how to address them. Implementation of the TA will \nresult in three outputs: \n \n11.  Output 1: Government\u2019s understanding of selected international experiences with \nthe organization and financing of public service delivery and social security systems \nenhanced. Activities under this output will include preparing comparative research (desk study) \non international experiences with organizing and financing public service delivery and social \nsecurity systems. It will also include the delivery of capacity development workshops. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Government\u2019s  understanding  of  the  empirical  relation  between  tax \nstructure, intergovernmental fiscal framework, public financial management systems and \nprocesses, and the delivery of services and social security enhanced. This output will be \nachieved through a combination of an in-depth empirical assessment, including field work in \nseveral local governments, and capacity development workshops. \n \n13.  Output 3: Policy advice on the reform of the PRC\u2019s tax structure, intergovernmental \nfiscal framework, and public financial management practices finalized. This output will be \nachieved through the preparation of a report synthesizing the findings and conclusions from \noutputs 1 and 2, including evidence-based policy recommendations. \n \n14.  Given the nature of the government\u2019s request, TA is seen as the most appropriate \napproach. At this stage, it is not foreseen that high-level technology solutions will be used in the \nimplementation of the TA; the TA will be administered by ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $350,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \n16.
