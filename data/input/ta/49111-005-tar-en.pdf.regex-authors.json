The Government of Sri Lanka requested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to support the improvement of the railway sector of Sri Lanka. The project will finance high-\nimpact subprojects to modernize the railway network of Sri Lanka by improving the operational \nefficiency, maintenance capacity, safety, skills development, and implementation capacity of Sri \nLanka Railways (SLR). The project will (i) improve the operational efficiency of the railway network \nby addressing key operational bottlenecks with the modernization of the telecommunication, \nticketing, operations headquarters, and train control center systems; (ii) upgrade the railway \nworkshop at Ratmalana, and procure rolling stock and track maintenance equipment; (iii) improve \nrailway safety mainly through the construction of housing blocks to support the future resettlement \nof informal dwellers, and the improvement of the Colombo Fort and Maradana stations; (iv) \nupgrade the Sri Lanka German Railway Technical Training Center; and (v) support project \nimplementation capacity and readiness. \n \n2.  The project will promote inclusive economic growth by improving the efficiency and \nsustainability of the railway network, which will contribute to expanding the market share of railway \ntransport,  mitigating  the  impacts  of  road  congestion,  and  supporting  the  development  of \ncompetitive services and industries in Sri Lanka. The project will be supported by an attached \ntechnical assistance (TA) that will strengthen SLR\u2019s management information systems (MIS) and \nasset management capacity. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Context.  The  Department  of  Sri  Lanka  Railway,  established  in  1858  as  Ceylon \nGovernment Railway, ran its first train in 1864 to transport coffee from the hill districts of Sri Lanka \nto the port of Colombo. It owns and operates the railway network under the name Sri Lanka \nRailways (SLR) and is administratively set up as a department under the Ministry of Transport & \nCivil Aviation (MOTCA). The legal framework under which SLR operates is primarily based on the \nRailway Ordinance of 1902. Most of the infrastructure is old and has not been modernized in \nrecent decades; the original mechanical interlocking systems procured in 1902 continue to be \nused on the Kelani Valley line in suburban Colombo. \n \n4.  Operations.  The  current  operating  procedures  of  SLR  are  consequently  heavily \ninfluenced by historical considerations. Automation is very limited, and most planning, operating, \nand recording activities are carried out manually. Paper tickets are printed at SLR headquarters, \nand typesetters must manually arrange the letterpress blocks for the 60,000 ticket combinations \nfrequently requested. Physical tickets are then sent by train to each station. Once purchased by \npassengers,  daily  ticket  sales  are  then  manually  logged  (handwritten)  by  ticket  type  and \ndestination at each station, and revenues and records are sent by train back to the headquarters. \nRevenues are then coded in a database, and summary reports are generated on a monthly basis. \nThe overall process requires a very significant workforce for printing, dispatching, writing, and \ncoding, and is therefore prone to error. \n \n5.  Accounting. Revenue is analyzed by station and ticket type. Recurrent and capital \nexpenditures are analyzed by subdepartment and account code. SLR is funded by budgetary \nsupport from the government, and operation revenues of SLR accrue to the Treasury Operations \nDepartment of the Ministry of Finance. However, with an operating ratio of 2.17 as of 2017, SLR \nis de facto heavily subsidized, but also underfunded, by the government. There are no formal \n ", "2 \narrangements  for  public  service  obligations,  and  the  budget  requested  by  SLR  is  largely \nindependent of operations. SLR does not receive any public service obligation payments for the \nnoncommercial services that it provides. \n \n6.  Under its current organization, SLR\u2019s accounting records do not provide its managers with \na clear overview of day-to-day operations. Accounting is on a cash basis, prepared at the \nsubdepartment level (e.g., way and works, maintenance divisions, planning, and administration) \nand summarized at the department level. Income statements, cashflow statements, and balance \nsheets cannot be prepared given the low automation. Almost all data collection and analysis are \ncarried  out  manually  and  there  is  a  pressing  need  for  computerization,  starting  with  the \nestablishment of an MIS.1 The MIS would capture all financial data and relevant operational data \nto  provide  (i)  financial  accounting  reports  suitable  for  making  the  required  statutory  and \ngovernment submissions, and (ii) management accounting reports on profitability and variances \nbetween actual and budgeted or planned performance. \n \n7.  Business procedures mapping. International good business practice is to structure a \nrail entity into separate business units, such as passenger and freight, each of which comprises \na set of profit centers into which all related revenues and costs are aggregated. Each profit center \nshould bear all its related direct costs, which should include maintenance, depreciation, and an \nallocation of indirect costs. Support functions, such as finance and human resources, normally \nremain as cost centers. While this may represent a target organizational structure for SLR, it is \nunlikely to be achieved in the short or medium term in the current institutional framework. A more \nrealistic shorter-term target is to build on the existing service groupings (suburban, local, long-\ndistance, and railbus), where recurrent expenditures are subdivided between variable and fixed \noperating and infrastructure costs, and then to aggregate revenues and direct operating costs by \ntype of train service to assess their profitability. Business process mapping will represent the first \nstep for the implementation of the MIS and of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. \n \n8.  Asset management strategy. The overall asset management strategy is being devised \nby Masterplan consultants (footnote 1). The lack of information technology (IT) systems in SLR\u2019s \nmanagement of asset life cycle maintenance is a hindrance to its sustainability, particularly for \nrolling stock, but also for tracks and other equipment. The maintenance workshop in Ratmalana \nis the primary maintenance center for rolling stock. The activities of the maintenance departments \nneed to be further coordinated and linked meaningfully to stores and operations data. The data \nmust be made accessible for the preparation of statistics, MIS, costing, customer relations \nmanagement, and corporate planning. \n \n9.  Technical assistance scope. The transaction TA will help strengthen SLR\u2019s MIS and \nasset maintenance capacity, which will both require long-term support and incremental changes \nfor successful modernization. The TA will assist in preparing a road map for the implementation \nof  the  strategies  and  in  implementing  a  pilot  subproject.  It  will  complement  infrastructure \nimprovements financed under the loan and will help SLR define, develop, and implement several \nmeasures aimed at modernizing and improving the efficiency of the railway sector. \n \n10.  Technical assistance modality. The transaction TA was prepared in response to a \nrequest by MOTCA for ADB assistance to increase the capacity of SLR in IT and accounting. \nMOTCA and ADB defined the TA objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements. Use of \nthe TA modality rather than a loan subcomponent is proposed to (i) continue the long-term \n                                                \n1  The Masterplan consultants engaged under separate ADB assistance recommend the use of an interim approach in \nADB. Sri Lanka: Railway Master Plan. \n ", "3 \npartnership of the government and ADB on policy dialogue and capacity development, (ii) \nstrengthen the capacity of MOTCA and SLR in areas where knowledge and management gaps \nhave been identified, and (iii) enhance project monitoring and improve the likelihood of achieving \nthe proposed outputs and outcome. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor Sri Lanka, 2019\u20132021.2 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Management information system modernization strategy developed. The \nTA will improve the efficiency of SLR by undertaking the following activities, with the objective of \ndeveloping an MIS and ERP system framework and implementation plan, and supporting capacity \nbuilding of technical manpower from the government. \n(i)  Undertake  comprehensive  system  analysis  and  business  process  mapping, \nincluding capturing all available data and user information requirements. \n(ii)  Identify all potential available data to be migrated into the new MIS system. \n(iii)  Consult with relevant divisions of SLR and other stakeholders to define all user \ninformation and reporting requirements related to accounting and finance, human \nresources,  passenger  information  and  ticketing,  operating  information,  asset \nmanagement (infrastructure and rolling stock), freight, procurement, information \nand communication technology, and materials management. \n(iv)  Identify and assess business process reengineering (BPR) requirements, while \nconsidering the sensitivities of SLR staff. \n(v)  Prepare a BPR report and discuss with the Steering Committee any key decisions \nregarding implementation.
