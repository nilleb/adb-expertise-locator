The technical assistance (TA) will support the Greater Mal\u00e9 Waste-to-Energy Project, \nwhich is aligned with the following impact: waste as a valuable resource for income generation \npromoted.1 The project will have the following outcome: solid waste treatment and disposal \nservices improved in the Greater Mal\u00e9 region and its outer islands. The two outputs are as follows: \n(i)  disaster-  and  climate-resilient  regional  waste  management  facility  developed,  and  (ii) \ninstitutional capacity in sustainable waste-to-energy (WTE) service delivery and environmental \nmonitoring, and public awareness on WTE and reduce-reuse-recycle improved. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  No experience in monitoring large-scale waste-to-energy operations. The project will \ndevelop a 500-tons-per-day WTE facility, including a WTE treatment plant with air pollution control \nsystem, emissions monitoring, a bottom ash processing plant, and a landfill for safe disposal of \nair pollution control residues and non-marketable bottom ashes. A design\u2013build\u2013operate (DBO) \ncontract will shift the technical risk from the government to a professional contractor who is best \npositioned to manage it. The DBO contract sets key performance requirements (guarantees) and \ndamages as leverage for the contractor\u2019s compliance during operation and maintenance (O&M). \nThe government will be responsible for monitoring O&M performance over the 15-year operation \nservice period. \n \n2.  The Ministry of Environment (MOE), which will be the owner of the plant (or the employer, \naccording to the DBO contract terminology), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \nwhich  will  be  the  regulator,  have  experience  in  overseeing  and  monitoring  solid  waste \nmanagement (SWM) but no experience with complex WTE operations and DBO contracts. For \neffective contract management and environmental compliance during operations, the MOE and \nEPA require an in-depth understanding of the (i) WTE technology and control systems applied; \n(ii) DBO contractual obligations and leverage mechanisms to correct any non-compliance during \nthe operations; (iii) emission monitoring system and the plant information management system; \nand (iv) reporting and optimal monitoring requirements. Also, there is a need to assess and \nimprove the institutional capacity of the MOE and EPA to monitor WTE operations, including \ninstitutional resources (e.g., number of staff, instrumentation), processes, and systems. \n \n3.  Financial sustainability during operation and maintenance. After completion of the \ndesign and build period, the government will be responsible for paying the operator the full cost \nof operating and maintaining the WTE facility developed under the project for the duration of the \noperation period. Total O&M costs for the plant are estimated at $10 million\u2013$11 million per year. \nThe WTE plant will have four different sources of revenue: (i) proceeds from the sale of electricity, \n(ii) proceeds from the sale of metals, (iii) proceeds from the sale of incineration bottom ash, and \n(iv) a tipping fee from resort waste. The State Electric Company Limited, the government-owned \nelectricity company, will purchase the surplus electricity generated by the WTE plant2. Metals and \nbottom ash can potentially be sold to the construction industry. Estimated annual revenue from \nsales of all the three by-products from the WTE plant (electricity, metals and bottom ash) and \n \n1  Government of Maldives. 2019. Strategic Action Plan, 2019\u20132023. Mal\u00e9.   \n2  The government will confirm through a memorandum of understanding between the MOF, MOE, and State Electric \nCompany Limited that all surplus electricity from the WTE plant will be sold at a minimum price of $0.10 per kilowatt-\nhour in line with current market prices. \n ", "2 \ntipping fee from resort waste will only cover 96% of the annual O&M requirements, resulting in an \nO&M funding gap during operations that will be covered through government transfers. Although \na fund flow arrangement for government payment for O&M is included in the project administration \nmanual, the fund flow needs to be updated before commencement of the O&M period to ensure \ntimely payments for sustainable operations. In addition, the SWM tariff, fee, or other tax may be \ngradually increased to enhance financial sustainability and shift to a polluter pays principle, which \nincentivizes reduce-reuse-recycle in line with the National SWM Policy (2015)3 and Strategic \nAction Plan, 2019\u20132023 (footnote 1). Support to finalize the financing plan for O&M payment and \nto develop a full O&M cost recovery strategy, which may have a sophisticated structure, is \nrequired to ensure smooth and sustainable WTE service delivery. \n \n4.  Project implementation support to the project management unit. This is the second \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) project to be implemented by the MOE\u2019s Waste Management \nand Pollution Control Department and its project management unit (PMU). However, further \ncapacity support to the PMU is required to help smoothly implement the project given the \ncomplexity of (i) the WTE plant and the DBO contract; (ii) environmental safeguards during WTE \nplant construction and operation; and (iii) the project\u2019s financial management, owing to its multiple \nsources of cofinancing (i.e., the ADB grant and loan, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \nloan, and the Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism grant). This is consistent with \nprevious  ADB  project  evaluation  reports  suggesting  capacity  support  during  project \nimplementation.4 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  Output  1:  Ministry  of  Environment,  and  Environmental  Protection  Agency \ninstitutional capacity to supervise waste-to-energy service delivery strengthened. Key \nactivities include (i) assessing the institutional capacity of the MOE and EPA to monitor WTE \nperformance and emission standards; (ii) developing and supporting implementation of plans to \nstrengthen MOE and EPA capacity for supervising sustainable WTE service delivery, including \nadditional resources, systems, and processes; (iii) training eligible MOE and EPA staff on \nsupervising sustainable WTE operations (i.e., WTE technology, control systems and continuous \nemission monitoring, contractual obligations of the DBO contractor, contract management, and \nasset replacement including cost implications); and (iv) conducting exchange visits for MOE and \nEPA staff to expose them to international best practices in monitoring WTE operations and \nenvironmental performance. These activities will be complemented by on-the-job trainings for \nMOE and EPA (tailored on the WTE facility built), which the DBO contractor will provide during \nthe first year of O&M under the supervision of the project management design and construction \nsupervision consultant. \n \n6.  Output 2: Financial sustainability for waste-to-energy service delivery improved. \nThis output will include (i) updated forecasting of WTE plant\u2019s O&M financial needs; and (ii) \nfinalization of O&M financing plan for sustainable WTE services, including financing sources, fund \nflow arrangements to pay the DBO contractor on time during the operational period, and a revenue \nenhancement plan to improve O&M cost recovery and to transfer O&M costs to polluters through \ntariffs, fees, or tax increases over the long-term. \n   \n7.  Output 3: Implementation support to the project management unit in contract \nmanagement,  performance  monitoring,  safeguards  requirements,  and  financial \n \n3 Government of Maldives, MOE. 2015.

This output will support the PMU in the following areas: (i) project \nmanagement  during  the  design  and  build  period  of the WTE  plant,  including  performance \nmonitoring  of  the  DBO  contractor  and  project  consultants;  (ii)  environmental  safeguards \nrequirements  compliance;  and  (iii)  financial  management.  These  activities  will  mitigate \nimplementation risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The transaction TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditures items \nare listed in Appendix 1. \n \n9.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and \nother in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB will administer the TA. The Urban Development and Water Division of ADB\u2019s South \nAsia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented over 54 months. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the \nexecuting agency, and the MOE will be the implementing agency, working closely with the EPA. \nThe project steering committee will provide overall guidance and strategic direction for the TA, \nwhile the project technical committee will advise and facilitate to resolve technical issues.5 \n \n12.
