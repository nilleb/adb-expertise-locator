INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2012  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for establishing a regional knowledge hub on green growth and \neco-compensation in the PRC. In August 2013, a fact-finding mission visited the PRC and \nreached an understanding with the government on the TA project\u2019s impact, outcome, output, \ncost estimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since the 1990s, the growth rates of the economies of Asia and the Pacific have been \namong the highest in the world. The strong economic growth lifted more than half a billion of the \nregion\u2019s people out of poverty and raised their living standards. However, this success has been \nachieved at enormous cost to the environment. Rapid industrialization and urbanization have \nbeen accompanied by accelerated exploitation of natural resources and a massive increase in \nthe discharge of pollutants.   \n \n3.  Environmental  degradation  results  when  valuable  services  provided  by  natural \necosystems are not properly priced within the market. Currently, economic instruments for \ncreating such markets or promoting the sustainable management of natural resources are not \nfully in place. This is leading to an unequal distribution of ecological and economic benefits \nbetween protectors of natural resources and those who benefit from their efforts. As a result, \nnatural  ecosystems  continue  to  be  degraded  or  lost.  Indeed,  the  failure  of  society  to \ncompensate  for  conserving  the  environment  contributes  to  the  rapid  and  environmentally \ndamaging changes to ecosystems that are taking place in the world. The PRC is a case in point.  \n \n4.  The  concept  of  green  growth  emerged  amid  concerns  over  increasing  resource \nconstraints and growing environmental risks that could threaten social stability and economic \ndevelopment. The countries of Asia and the Pacific have committed to green growth policies in \nresponse to the challenges of sustainable development and the growing demand for a transition \nto green growth. In the region, priority strategies identified for green growth include reforming \nthe  economic  incentives  framework,  promoting  sustainable  infrastructure  development,  and \nfacilitating investments in natural capital.2 In the PRC, the government\u2019s new leadership has \nshifted  its  strategic  thinking  to  embrace  ideas of green growth  summarized  as  \u201cecological \ncivilization,\u201d and has made it a top priority of the government\u2019s agenda.3  \n \n5.  Since 2000, eco-compensation, or payment for ecosystem services (PES), has become \na  useful  tool  to  support  green  growth  strategies  in  the  region.4 It  creates  incentives  for \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 May 2013. \n2  ADB, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and the United Nations Environment Programme. \n2012. Green Growth, Resources and Resilience. Bangkok. \n3   Ecological civilization is now not only gaining a significant foothold in the PRC, but also constitutes a new path for \nPRC\u2019s environmental protection that contributes to global sustainable development. Ecological civilization has been \nincorporated into decision document (Decision 27/8) by the 27th Governing Council of the United Nations \nEnvironmental Program (First Universal Session). \n4  In the context of this TA report, \u201cpayment for ecological services\u201d (PES) refers to programs that involve actual \nfinancial transactions or relate to a market. On the other hand, \u201ceco-compensation\u201d refers to the broader inputs for \ndeveloping PES schemes and building a PES market, such as the policies, laws, capacity building, and institutional \n \n ", "2   \nsustainable ecosystem services, addresses livelihood issues for the rural poor, and provides \nsustainable financing for protected areas. The PRC has one of the largest PES arrangements in \nthe  world  to  protect  its  degraded  watersheds.  This  scheme  has  sought  to  improve \nenvironmental management outcomes by using fiscal transfers or direct payments between key \nstakeholders to align the social and private costs and benefits of environmental protection. A \nnational eco-compensation ordinance is now being developed. Viet Nam has also taken the \nimportant  step  of  providing  a  legal  basis  for  PES,  which  has  facilitated  investments  by \nhydropower companies and water utilities in watershed management. There are many PES-like \narrangements on a smaller scale in other countries in the region. \n \n6.  Another  important  PES-related  development  is  the  creation  of  markets  for  carbon \nemission reductions from reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). \nREDD-plus investments provide a unique opportunity to address both climate change and rural \npoverty while protecting fragile ecosystems, conserving biodiversity, and sustaining resource-\ndependent livelihoods.5 In Asia and the Pacific, the Mekong Basin, Indonesia, Papua New \nGuinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu are poised to become significant participants in these \nactions and are among their largest beneficiaries (footnote 2). \n \n7.  The  initiative  to  establish  a  regional  knowledge  hub  on  green  growth  and  eco-\ncompensation grew from a series of consultations in connection with the preparation of various \nknowledge  products  and  knowledge-sharing  events. 6 Since  2009,  three  international \nconferences on eco-compensation and PES have been held. These events were attended by \nrepresentatives from developing member countries (DMCs) (including Cambodia, the PRC, the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam); members of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (including Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, and the \nUnited States); and ADB departments (the East Asia Department [EARD], the Regional and \nSustainable  Development  Department,  South  Asia  Department,  and  the  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment). The participants agreed that there is an urgent need for networking to share \nknowledge and innovations on eco-compensation and PES in the region as its role in supporting \ngreen growth becomes increasingly prominent. \n \n8.  Demand for knowledge solutions for green development  is intensifying as the PRC \ntransits to middle-income status and its environmental challenges mount. Eco-compensation is \nclearly on the top-level policy agenda. The communique of the recently concluded Third Plenum \nof the 18th Party Congress states that \u201cto build Ecological Civilization,\u2026 PRC must set \u2018redlines\u2019 \nfor ecological protection and adopt user-pay and eco-compensation mechanisms.\u201d The PRC is \nalso paying growing attention to knowledge partnerships to share its development experiences \nand learn from other developing countries. Many developing countries are also interested in \nPRC\u2019s  development  experiences  and  lessons.  Recognizing  the  key  role  of  knowledge \ngeneration and application to development in its Strategy 2020, ADB has been supporting \nknowledge cooperation among its DMCs.7 Against this backdrop, ADB has conducted various \n                                                                                                                                                       \ncoordination that is also a part of both enabling environments to perform their natural services and enabling PES \nschemes to succeed.   \n5  REDD-plus also includes conservation and sustainable management of forests and the enhancement of forest \ncarbon stocks.  \n6   ADB.  2010.

", "  3 \nconsultations with the PRC on its possible sponsorship of a knowledge hub through the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC), the leading agency for preparing the National \nEco-Compensation Ordinance.      \n \n9.  During  the  PRC  country  programming  mission  in  December  2012,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, the NDRC, and ADB agreed on the importance of establishing a knowledge hub on \ngreen  growth  and  eco-compensation  to  further  promote  mutual  learning  and  sharing  of \nknowledge, practices, and innovations on eco-compensation within the PRC, and between the \nPRC and other DMCs.  \n \n10.  Establishing such a knowledge hub is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, \nEnvironment Operation Directions, and Knowledge Management Directions and Action Plan.8 In \nparticular, eco-compensation can create economic incentives to effectively implement integrated \nwater  resources  management  in  river  basins.  It  is  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \npartnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015,  which  supports  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  building  a \nharmonious  society  by  promoting  environmentally  sustainable  development.9 The  proposed \nknowledge hub will also assist in mainstreaming knowledge-sharing activities in the priority \nsectors of the country partnership strategy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the proposed knowledge hub will be enhanced knowledge and practices \non green growth in DMCs. The outcome of the TA will be a mechanism for knowledge sharing \non green growth and eco-compensation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The knowledge hub is expected to produce the following outputs: (i) the knowledge \nhub\u2019s charter and operational plan developed, during which the institutional framework of the \nknowledge hub, and stakeholders and target audience will be identified, and a communication \nand  marketing  plan  will  be  prepared;  (ii)  a  bilingual  website  for  green  growth  and  eco-\ncompensation established; (iii) a database on green growth and eco-compensation established, \ncomposed of international and national best practices and case studies; (iv) annual progress \nreports on green growth and eco-compensation published; and (v) an annual knowledge sharing \nconference on green growth and eco-compensation organized. \n \n13.  The  knowledge  hub  will  cover  the  nine  key  areas  of  the  PRC\u2019s  eco-compensation \nprogram targets: forestland, grasslands, wetlands, water, marine resources and ecosystems, \ndesertified  areas  and  wastelands,  mining  zones,  key  ecological  function  areas,  and \ndevelopment-restricted areas. The TA will include case studies focusing on watershed services \nas these services (i) depend on scale and location, and (ii) require innovative approaches to \nensure that key communities participate in land-use changes in a coordinated manner and at \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

In establishing the knowledge hub, ADB will engage consultants and supervise the TA \nactivities. ADB\u2019s Water Community of Practice will co-organize an annual eco-compensation \nconference  with  the  knowledge  hub.  ADB  staff,  including  those  from  knowledge  support \ndepartments, will also participate in the TA as speakers and resource persons in the regional \nconference on eco-compensation, and in the steering committee or working group to guide the \nfurther development of the knowledge hub.  \n \n15.  An international consultant will be engaged to network with the knowledge centers, \nuniversities, or government agencies of other DMCs in South, Southeast, Central, West, and \nEast Asia. He or she will collect and organize relevant materials and make these available on \nthe knowledge  hub\u2019s  website.  He  or  she  will  also  help  organize  DMC  participation  in  the \nworkshops and seminars.    \n \n16.  The  knowledge  hub  will  collaborate  closely  with  the  ongoing  activities  for  regional \nknowledge sharing initiatives, particularly the existing knowledge hubs with universities in the \nPRC. In 2009, ADB and PRC\u2019s Ministry of Finance established a knowledge sharing platform to \n(i) promote cooperation among developing countries on key development issues, (ii) contribute \nto sound development management and policy making, and (iii) promote regionally inclusive \ndevelopment. Each year, the knowledge sharing platform conducts workshop on a different \ntheme.  Based  on  this  experience,  several  knowledge  hubs  have  been  set  up  in  PRC \nuniversities\u2019 centers of excellence to further enrich knowledge sharing experiences between the \nPRC and other DMCs.11    \n \n17.  After the knowledge hub has been established, the NDRC, with support from ADB, will \nseek complementary funding from other sources, including national and local government, and \ncollaborating partner organizations in and outside the region. \n \n18.  The knowledge  hub  will  involve  collaboration  with  members  of  civil  society,  private \ncompanies, and international partners. Partnerships with research centers in and outside the \nregion will be promoted under the knowledge hub. In particular, the knowledge hub will establish \npartnerships with the Global Green Growth Institute, Ecosystem Marketplace, the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Center for International Forestry Research, \nForest Trends, and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research Challenge \nProgram for Water and Food, all of which conduct work on PES.  \n \n                                                \n10 Other types of services, for example, carbon sequestration, methane emissions reduction, and carbon emissions \nreduction do not depend on a particular location (i.e., the same amount of carbon can be sequestered from trees \ngrown in many different areas) or scale (i.e., the amount of carbon in individual trees sequestered generally \ndepends on how many other trees exist in the same forest, not how much total land is enrolled in the eco-\ncompensation program). A unit of carbon in one area is equal to a unit of carbon in another. This makes a common \nmarket possible in which a variety of buyers and sellers can transact. In contrast, the management of water \nquantity and quality, and control of water and soil erosion require moderate to high levels of coordination, as well \nas innovative approaches.      \n11 The knowledge hubs include the Urban Knowledge Hub set up in 2010 and the Asia-Pacific Center for Water \nSecurity in 2011. ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund12 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of office space, administrative staff, \nworkshop facilities, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The executing agency for the TA will be ADB. A memorandum of understanding, which \nsets out the scope of cooperation between ADB\u2019s EARD and the NDRC, will be signed by both \nparties.  A  joint  EARD\u2013NDRC  steering  committee  will  guide  the  strategic  direction  of  the \nknowledge hub, and a joint working group will oversee daily activities under the TA.  \n \n21.  The China Agricultural University (CAU) will be engaged on a single-source selection \nbasis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). An international consultant will be hired separately as an individual consultant. \nCAU is the preeminent natural resources management school in the PRC and is the best \nqualified  institution  to  lead  and  implement  an  eco-compensation  knowledge  research  and \nsharing in collaboration with the NDRC. CAU is selected to support this knowledge hub on the \nbasis of its (i) vision and leadership in green growth, particularly for resource efficiency and eco-\ncompensation;  (ii)  focus  on  supporting  social  development  and  inclusive  growth;  (iii) \nexperienced international and national specialists; (iv) experience in disseminating state-of-the-\nart eco-compensation knowledge; and (v) adequate human and financial resources. CAU also \nprovides a postgraduate (Master\u2019s and doctoral) program on eco-compensation for international \nstudents from Africa and Southeast Asia. \n \n22.  The  single-source  selection  method  was  agreed  upon  in  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s \nOperations Services and Financial Management Department because CAU has exceptional \nqualifications and experience for the assignment. It is the leading institution in the area of eco-\ncompensation  in  the  PRC  and  has  the  experts  most  qualified  to  conduct  and  coordinate \nresearch in this field. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2015. Disbursements \nunder the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). As CAU will be implementing ADB projects \nindependently for the first time, financial management training will be given through the PRC \nResident Mission or EARD when TA implementation starts.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility to the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Establishing a Regional Knowledge Hub on \nGreen Growth and Eco-Compensation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n12 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland.
