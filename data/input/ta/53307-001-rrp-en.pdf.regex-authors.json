THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Bhutan for the Rural Finance Development Project. The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Rural Finance Development, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will enhance access to finance for rural cottage and small industries (CSIs), \nthereby increasing rural employment and promoting economic development. The project focuses \non (i) expanding collateral-based rural CSI financing through Bhutan Development Bank (BDB), \nBhutan\u2019s key rural finance intermediary; (ii) extending, through BDB, non-collateral-based group \nloans to rural CSIs that lack assets; (iii) strengthening BDB\u2019s institutional capacity, including \nenhancement for rural CSI financing operations; and (iv) providing financial literacy training and \nbusiness development support to rural CSIs, in particular CSIs owned by small and marginal \nfarmers and women. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economy.  During  2010\u20132019,  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  grew  more  than  6%  annually  on \naverage largely owing to hydropower revenue, which accounts for about a quarter of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP).2 Because of the capital-intensive nature of growth, the economy is not \nwell diversified and unable to create sufficient employment opportunities, especially for youth and \nthe rural population. The unemployment rate was 2.7% in 2019, with youth unemployment at \n11.9%.3 Out of a total population of about 807,600, 62.2% live in rural areas where agriculture is \nthe primary source of livelihood.4 In rural areas, opportunities for both on-farm and off-farm \nemployment are extremely limited and farmers mostly depend on subsistence production of crops \nand livestock for their living.5 The government\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023, aims to \ndiversify the economy by creating jobs and promoting the private sector, including rural CSIs.6 \n \n \n4. In 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant adverse \nimpacts on Bhutan\u2019s economy. Tourism, agriculture, and construction have been particularly hard-\nhit because of labor shortages, decreased external demands, and input supply disruptions. Pre-\npandemic GDP growth was projected at 5.2% for fiscal year (FY) 2020 and 5.8% for FY2021.7 \nHowever, because of the pandemic, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has revised the GDP \n \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Off-farm enterprises are \ninvolved in all types of economic activities other than subsistence production and other on-farm activities.

", "2 \ngrowth rate projections downwards to 2.4% in FY2020 and 1.7% in FY2021.8 The pandemic\u2019s \nimpacts are more severe for informal sector workers and the self-employed, who have limited \nfinancial assets and resources to cope with the economic shock. ADB estimated that about 23,000 \njobs are at risk because of the pandemic. Due to the pandemic\u2019s effect, additional 2,176\u201312,362 \npeople will result in living on less than $1.90 a day (adjusted for purchasing power parity).9  \n \n5.  Government policy. The government\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 specifically \nfocuses on creating income-generating opportunities for vulnerable populations and enhancing \nthe rural economy by promoting CSIs and improving access to finance for CSIs, including startups \nand informal CSIs (footnote 6). The government\u2019s National Financial Inclusion Strategy, 2018\u2013\n2023 envisions enhancing access to affordable formal financial services for all Bhutanese.10 The \nstrategy specifically aims to enhance financing to (i) strengthen priority economic activities, \nparticularly agricultural and nonagricultural CSIs; and (ii) promote innovative credit mechanisms \nand alternative sources of financing. \n \n6.  Cottage and small industries. CSIs are micro and small enterprises that are primarily \ninvolved in production of crops and livestock (on-farm enterprises), as well as small-scale \nmanufacturing and services such as retail shops, transport, and restaurants (off-farm enterprises) \n(footnote 5). Most CSIs are rural-based cottage-sized on-farm enterprises with the investment \nsize below Nu500,000 and run by household members.11 In Bhutan, CSIs constitute more than \n90% of total enterprises and employ about 99,288 people, with 22,064 registered CSIs in 2019. \nIn addition to registered CSIs, there are many informal CSIs. CSIs face various constraints, \nincluding poor access to finance and bureaucratic hurdles related to labor regulation, taxation, \nand registration. Among these, access to finance is the largest constraint.12 Men- and women-\nowned CSIs face similar challenges; however, these challenges are often greater for women, who \nsuffer from low literacy, low self-confidence, and a lack of education, training, and entrepreneurial \nand technical skills.13 Other key constraints for women-owned CSIs include labor shortages and \ninadequate business premises. As a result of these constraints, most women-owned CSIs are \nunable to scale up their businesses, and therefore remain at subsistence level. \n \n7.  Rural finance. Bhutan\u2019s finance sector comprises six banks, four nonbank financial \ninstitutions (two insurance companies, one reinsurance company, and one pension fund), and \nfive microfinance institutions. The six banks are further categorized into four commercial banks, \n \n8  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Supplement: Lockdown, Loosening, and Asia\u2019s Growth Prospects. \nManila.

Rural CSIs lack access to finance because their financing requires a different set of \nexpertise and methodology from regular commercial banking. Many CSI owners are illiterate or \nsemiliterate and have limited financial literacy, therefore lack the capacity to develop business \nproposals, which are needed for financing from formal financial institutions. Commercial banks \nlack business expertise in CSI financing and impose stringent collateral requirements, as per \nstandard commercial banking risk management practices. This generally excludes them from \nlending to CSIs, most of which do not own sufficient physical collateral. BDB, the key formal \nfinancial intermediary with a CSI financing mandate, offers collateral-based loans to CSIs by \nmostly accepting rural land; however, the value of rural land is difficult to assess. As a result, it \ndoes not facilitate an effective CSI credit risk management. Further, BDB has funding constraints \nand weak financial and operational performance in extending financial services to rural CSIs. BDB \nneeds to improve its credit appraisal methodology to effectively mitigate risks in lending to CSIs. \n \n9.  Bhutan Development Bank. BDB was incorporated in January 1988 with support from \nADB to function as a development finance institution.15 BDB obtained its banking license in March \n2010. The government owns 97% of the total paid-up capital. BDB\u2019s key function is to provide \nfinancial services to agricultural, commercial, and industrial enterprises, especially CSIs. BDB is \nthe most important rural finance intermediary in the country, accounting for 95% of the total \nagriculture loan portfolio and 84% of the CSI loan portfolio in 2019.16 In 2019, BDB\u2019s total gross \nloans amounted to Nu20 billion, with 50,501 rural CSI borrowers, of which 41% were women. \nBDB\u2019s funding sources are limited\u201484% of BDB\u2019s funding comes from customer deposits, 5% \ncomprises borrowing from other commercial banks, 1% is derived from investments, and the \nremainder is equity. BDB also provides non-collateral-based group loans (group loans) to enable \nCSIs with no or little collateral to access to finance. However, group loans constitute only about \n1% of BDB\u2019s total loan portfolio.17 \n \n10.  BDB\u2019s  financial  performance,  in  particular  its  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  and \nprofitability,  is  weak  (Table  1).  ADB\u2019s  financial  due  diligence  and  financial  management \nassessment  found  that  BDB  does  not  fully  meet  ADB  eligibility  criteria  for  financial \nintermediaries.18 BDB is undercapitalized and its capital adequacy ratio is below the minimum \ncapital adequacy ratio of 12.5% set by the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA), the central bank. \nBDB\u2019s financial sustainability is weakened by nonperforming loans (NPLs)\u2014its NPL ratio was \n \n14 National CSI Bank was established in February 2020 by converting the Rural Enterprise Development Corporation \nLimited, a microfinance institution established by the government in 2016. Based on ADB\u2019s financial due diligence \nand financial management assessment and because of its small size (about 0.2% of the total finance sector portfolio), \nNational CSI Bank was not considered for financing under the project. \n15 ADB. 1988.

Manila. \n16 Rural finance is defined as financial services in rural areas. Rural CSI financing is a subset of rural finance. However, \nin Bhutan, most rural clients of financial intermediaries are CSIs. Accordingly, rural finance and rural CSI financing \nare largely synonymous. \n17 Under group loans, loans are made to individual group members and members guarantee other members\u2019 loans. \n18 ADB. 2003.

The key eligibility criteria include \n(i) financial soundness; (ii) adequate credit and risk management policies, operating systems, and procedures; (iii) \ncompliance with prudential regulations; and (iv) acceptable corporate and financial governance.

This high NPL ratio largely stemmed from BDB\u2019s inadequate credit appraisal \nmethodology for rural CSIs, as well as natural calamities\u2014heavy rainfall and flooding in 2016 led \nto a nearly 100% increase in NPLs in 2017, as most of BDB\u2019s CSI loans are agriculture-related. \nHowever, the NPL ratio of 23.16% for 2019 does not present an accurate picture of BDB\u2019s portfolio \nquality because BDB carries loans classified as loss for more than 3 years\u2014legacy NPLs\u2014on its \nbalance sheet. 19 If legacy NPLs were written off, BDB\u2019s estimated NPL ratio would have been \n16.22% in 2019. COVID-19 response measures by the RMA to relief affected borrowers by \nrelaxing some repayment obligations negatively affected BDB\u2019s portfolio quality further in 2020.20 \nTo address these deficiencies, ADB and BDB have agreed to a time-bound BDB institutional \nstrengthening plan.     \n \nTable 1: Bhutan Development Bank Key Financial and Operational Indicators \nParticulars  2016  2017  2018  2019a  2020b \nCAR (%)  16.60  10.40  12.50  11.56  10.41 \nTotal gross loan  \n16,546.66  18,498.52  18,613.00  19,655.71  19,749.62 \n(Nu million) \nNPL ratio (%)  12.47  22.72  20.72  23.16c  37.00c \nROAE (%)  9.27  -33.27  9.06  7.74  -2.67 \nROAA (%)  1.42  -3.95  0.88  0.50  -29.31 \nCAR = capital adequacy ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROAA = return on average assets, ROAE = return on \naverage equity. \na  As of September 2019. \nb  Projections. \nc  Including legacy NPLs; if legacy NPLs are written off, the NPL ratio would be 16.22% in 2019. \nSources: Bhutan Development Bank, Annual Reports, various years, Thimphu; and Asian Development Bank \nestimates. \n \n11.  Key issues. Key constraints for the overall rural finance sector are summarized as (i) \nBDB\u2019s weak operational and financial performance, including inadequate institutional capacity in \nCSI financing; (ii) BDB\u2019s insufficient operationalization of non-collateral-based loans for CSIs that \nlack assets; (iii) CSIs\u2019 limited financial literacy; (iv) CSIs\u2019 lack of skills to develop adequate \nbusiness proposals; and (v) BDB\u2019s limited funding sources. \n \n12.  Proposed solution. The project will provide financing support to BDB to expand its rural \nCSI financing outreach under ADB\u2019s financial intermediation loan modality. The project will \nprovide credit lines to BDB for (i) collateral-based rural CSI financing, and (ii) non-collateral-based \ngroup loans. For collateral-based rural CSI financing, BDB will adopt collateral requirements \nestablished by BDB using a credit appraisal methodology acceptable to ADB. For non-collateral-\nbased group loans, BDB will mainly target rural CSIs that are owned by small and marginal \nfarmers and women who do not own sufficient physical assets for collateral. The attached TA will \ndevelop BDB\u2019s capacity to provide nonfinancial services essential to rural CSI clients, including \nfinancial literacy training and business development support. The financial intermediation loan \nmodality was chosen to achieve the dual objectives of (i) expanding financing outreach to rural \nCSIs, and (ii) strengthening BDB\u2019s capacity to ensure operational sustainability. \n \n19 The major constraints that prevent BDB from expediting write-off of its legacy NPLs are (i) lengthy legal process, (ii) \ndifficulties disposing rural collateral, and (iii) issues related to income tax provisions. BDB can legally write off legacy \nNPLs, but requires a prior approval from the RMA. The IMF recommends that the RMA issues guidelines to \nencourage banks to write off legacy NPLs. IMF. 2018. Article IV Consultation\u2014Press Release; Staff Report; and \nStatement by the Executive Director for Bhutan. Washington, DC. \n20 On 14 April 2020, the RMA announced monetary measures in response to COVID-19 including (i) deferment of loan \nrepayments, (ii) waiving interest rates on outstanding loans, (iii) extension of grace period, (iv) soft working capital \nloans for tourism-related businesses, and (v) subsidized loans to CSIs through National CSI Bank. \n ", "5 \n13.  The project will strengthen BDB\u2019s institutional capacity by supporting the implementation \nof BDB institutional strengthening plan. Selected institutional strengthening milestones are set \nforth in the project administration manual (PAM). 21 BDB\u2019s weaknesses can be improved with \nstructured interventions focusing on governance, portfolio quality including NPL management, \nand  internal  control  and  risk  management,  among  others.  ADB  established  that  BDB  has \nadequate capacity, organizational structure, and human resources to implement the plan. BDB \nhas commenced implementation of the plan and has (i) established a dedicated NPL resolution \nunit; (ii)  developed  a  comprehensive  NPL resolution  framework;  (iii) adopted  a  new  credit \nappraisal system that incorporates subproject-specific, risk-based analysis; and (iv) initiated \nintensified portfolio monitoring. Through those measures, BDB can effectively control portfolio \nquality, resolve NPLs, and improve its financial performance. Specifically, intensifying BDB\u2019s debt \nrecovery litigation and asset auctioning capacity under the NPL resolution framework will enable \nBDB to expedite NPL write-offs, including legacy NPLs. With the improved credit appraisal system, \nBDB can substantially reduce credit risks and prevent new NPLs. Furthermore, BDB will adopt \nappropriate  institutional  operational  policies,  including  improved  credit  manuals  and  a \ncomprehensive internal control and compliance framework, by December 2021, and an enhanced \naccounting policy and financial administration by-laws by June 2022. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s sector experience and lessons. The project builds on ADB\u2019s successful finance \nsector project experience in Bhutan. In 2007, ADB approved the Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises  Sector  Development  Program. 22  The  program  successfully  facilitated  BDB\u2019s \nreorientation toward micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise lending. ADB approved the \nFinancial Market Development Program (subprogram 1) in 2019 and subprogram 2 in 2020, which \nwill strengthen mobilization of resources and enhance stability and inclusiveness in the finance \nsector. 23 \n \n15.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational  priorities  of  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality, and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity.24 The project will promote rural employment generation and poverty reduction by \nenhancing rural CSI financing. The project will have a visible impact on gender equality by \nextending access to finance to at least 31,857 CSIs owned by women by 2024. The project will \nstrengthen BDB\u2019s institutional capacity and have a sustainable rural development impact. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n16.

With this credit line, BDB can leverage its rural CSI financing from Nu11.5 billion \nand 50,501 borrowers (of which 41% were CSIs owned by women) in 2019, to Nu17.3 billion with \n63,714 borrowers (of which 50% are CSIs owned by women) by 2024. \n \n18.  Output 2: Non-collateral-based rural cottage and small industry financing expanded. \nTo meet the needs of marginal rural CSIs lacking sufficient physical collateral to access financing \nfrom commercial banks, the project will finance a $5 million credit line for BDB to extend non-\ncollateral-based group loans to rural CSIs. Group-loan subborrowers will be limited to rural CSIs \nengaged in micro-scale enterprises, with an investment size of less than Nu1 million, that are \nsmaller than rural CSI financing subborrowers and have few or no tangible assets that can qualify \nas collateral. Group-loan subborrowers need to show their willingness to join a group and guarantee \nother group members\u2019 loans. The maximum group-loan amount is Nu500,000. With this credit line, \nBDB will reach at least 4,996 group-loan subborrowers, of which 65% are women, by 2024. \n \n19.  Output  3:  Bhutan  Development  Bank\u2019s  institutional  capacity  strengthened.  To \naddress BDB\u2019s operational and financial weaknesses, in particular its high level of NPLs, the \nproject will strengthen BDB by supporting the implementation of BDB\u2019s institutional strengthening \nplan. The plan\u2019s objective is to bring structural and operational changes to improve BDB\u2019s \nperformance and outreach, especially to rural CSIs. The BDB institutional strengthening plan is \nfocused on, but is not limited to (i) strengthening corporate governance, (ii) improving portfolio \nquality and resolving NPLs, (iii) initiating new credit appraisal methodologies, (iv) improving \nmanagement information systems, and (v) strengthening internal control and risk management. \nTo ensure that BDB\u2019s performance improves, key institutional strengthening milestones and \nperformance targets are included in the PAM (footnote 21). BDB will provide quarterly reports to \nADB on progress in the institutional strengthening plan\u2019s implementation, including achievement \nof milestones and targets, and the government will ensure that BDB implements remedial \nmeasures in case of non-achievement. The output will also support BDB\u2019s group-loan operations. \nThis output will be supported under the attached TA (para. 27). \n \nTable 2: Bhutan Development Bank Selected Key Performance Targets \nIndicators  2021  2022  2023  2024 \nCAR (%)  10.61  10.88  12.87  12.72 \nTotal gross loans (Nu million)  20,740.74  21,888.83  23,208.37  24,721.84 \nTotal gross CSI loans (Nu million)a  13,481.48  14,665.52  16,013.78  17,305.29 \nNPL ratio (%)b  25.00  21.93  19.81  18.65 \nNPL ratio \u2014for loans disbursed \nafter 1 January 2021 (%)  8.00  6.50  6.50  6.50 \nROAA (%)  0.54  0.67  1.03  1.10 \nROAE (%)  7.00  8.55  12.75  12.93 \nCAR = capital adequacy ratio, CSI = cottage and small industry, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROAA = return on \naverage assets, ROAE = return on average equity. \na  Including group loans. \nb  Including legacy NPLs. \nSources: Bhutan Development Bank and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "7 \n20.

ADB\u2019s small-scale knowledge TA facilitated the BDB institutional strengthening plan \ndevelopment.26 The project is relevant for Bhutan\u2019s post-COVID-19 economic recovery. While \nADB\u2019s COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program (footnote 9) provided \nimmediate social relief, this project is critical for the medium-term economic recovery. The \nproject\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  support  to  BDB  will  result  in  sustainable  rural  finance \nexpansion. The project complements the Financial Market Development Program (subprograms \n1 and 2) and contributes to the long-term financial sector development in Bhutan (footnote 23). \nThe project will have close coordination with development partners especially the German \nSavings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation for capacity development.27 \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The government has requested a concessional loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nTable 3: Summary Cost Estimates \nTotal Cost  Share of Total \nItem \n($ million)  (%) \nCredit line\u2014rural cottage and small \nindustry financinga  15.0  75.0 \nCredit line\u2014group loana  5.0  25.0 \n  Total   20.0  100.0 \na  The subborrowers are expected to contribute at least 25% of the total rural cottage and small \nindustry subproject investments from their own sources including in-kind or labor contributions. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable 4: Summary Financing Plan \n   Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \n   \nAsian Development Bank \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loan)  20.0  100.0 \n    Total  20.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26 ADB. 2019.

Relending. The government will relend the loan proceeds to BDB pursuant to a subsidiary \nloan agreement. The government expects to structure the subsidiary loan as follows: (i) $15 \nmillion of the subsidiary loan as a subordinated debt;28 and (ii) $5 million of the subsidiary loan as \nan unsubordinated debt. Tentatively, the subsidiary loan of $15 million subordinated debt will have \na 10-year term with no grace period, interest rate of 5.0% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions to be set forth in the subsidiary loan agreement between the government and BDB; \nand the subsidiary loan of $5 million unsubordinated debt will have a 10-year term with no grace \nperiod, an interest rate of 4.0% per year, and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in \nthe subsidiary agreement between the government and BDB. The final subsidiary loan terms and \nconditions  for  relending  will  be  determined  in  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the \ngovernment and BDB. BDB will use the subsidiary loan proceeds to sub-lend to eligible rural CSIs \nunder the two credit lines: (i) collateral-based rural CSI financing, and (ii) non-collateral-based \ngroup loans \u2500 established under outputs 1 and 2 of the project. \n \n24.  Sublending. BDB will sublend the subsidiary loan proceeds from the government to rural \nCSI subborrowers based on each credit line\u2019s eligibility criteria and terms and conditions: \n(i)  Collateral-based rural CSI financing. An eligible rural CSI subborrower (a) is an \nenterprise with an investment size of less than Nu10 million; (b) is composed of \nindividuals who are no younger than 18 years old; (c) is borrowing subloans against \nwhich  fixed  or  financial  assets  are  pledged,  based  on  collateral  requirements \nestablished by BDB using a credit appraisal methodology acceptable to ADB; (d) or its \nmembership have no record of NPLs with BDB or other financial institutions; and (e) \nhas demonstrated experience relevant to its proposed subproject. Rural CSI subloan \ninterest rates and maturity vary depending on types of activities and underlying risks \nof rural CSI subprojects. However, subloan interest rates should be adequate to cover \nall costs and risks associated with subprojects and ensure an adequate margin. \n(ii)  Non-collateral-based group loans. An eligible group-loan subborrower (a) is an \nenterprise with an investment size of less than Nu1 million; (b) has demonstrated that \nit cannot offer fixed or financial assets against which to borrow subloans; (c) is \ncomposed of individuals who are no younger than 18 years old; (d) has completed all \nnecessary preparatory work prior to applying for a subloan, including requirements \nestablished  by  BDB  for  demonstrating  collective  membership;  and  (e)  has \ndemonstrated that its membership has participated in group sensitization and training \nactivities  regarding  the  obligations  of  the  qualified  enterprise  and  its  individual \nmembers. The indicative sublending terms and conditions are an interest rate of 10% \nper annum, with a maturity of up to 5 years for group term loans, and up to 1 year for \ngroup seasonal loans.29 \n25.  Revolving fund (at BDB). The subloans repaid by subborrowers will be maintained at a \nseparate rural CSI financing account and group-loan fund account established at BDB. BDB will \nsublend to eligible subborrowers under the project\u2019s same onlending terms and conditions. The \nsame subborrower eligibility criteria will apply to rural CSI financing and group loans. \n \n28 In a bank\u2019s capital, a subordinated debt is qualified as a part of capital. The government\u2019s subordinated debt to BDB \nwill help improve BDB\u2019s capital adequacy. \n29 Group term loans are mainly for investments and group seasonal loans are mainly for working capital. \n ", "9 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The implementation period for the project is 4 years (January 2021\u2013December 2024). The \nMinistry of Finance will be the executing agency, and BDB will be the implementing agency (Table \n5). The implementation details are in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2021\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee:  \n(i)  Director general, Department of Macroeconomic Affairs; \n(ii)  Chief executive officer, Bhutan Development Bank; and \n(iii)  Bhutan Development Bank representative as the secretariat. \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance (Department of Macroeconomic Affairs) \n(iii)  Implementing agency  Bhutan Development Bank \n(iv)  Implementation unit  The project implementation unit will be headed by a project implementation unit \nmanager and at least one full-time staff. \nRetroactive financing  Withdrawals from the loan account may be made for reimbursement of eligible \nexpenditures incurred under the project before the effective date, but not earlier \nthan 12 months before the date of the loan agreement, subject to a maximum \namount equivalent to 20% of the loan amount. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. An advance account will be used. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n27.  The project will be supported through attached TA for Capacity Building for Rural Finance \nDevelopment. The TA has two outputs, which are aligned with the project: (i) BDB\u2019s institutional \ncapacity strengthened, and (ii) financial literacy training and business development support \nextended to rural CSIs. \n \n28.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB\u2019s South Asia Department will select, supervise, and \nevaluate the consultants. ADB will recruit international and national consultants using individual \nconsultant selection. ADB will procure consulting services following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  staff  instructions  for  ADB-administrated \nconsultants.30 The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); and $250,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund.31 \n \n \n30 The required consultant inputs include (i) international technical advisor to BDB (6 person-months), (ii) international \nbank restructuring specialist (16 person-months), (iii) international bank capacity development specialist (16 person-\nmonths), (iv) international rural finance specialist (16 person-months), (v) national core banking system specialist (9 \nperson-months), (vi) national environmental and social safeguards specialist (3 person-months), and (vii) national \ngender specialist (5 person-months).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n29.  The government has limited experience in building the institutional capacity of state-owned \nbanks. The attached TA addresses this constraint by assisting the government in developing and \nimplementing  the  BDB  institutional  strengthening  plan.  BDB\u2019s  expertise  in  rural  enterprise \nfinancing is also limited. The attached TA will support capacity building of BDB in rural CSI \nfinancing especially for non-collateral-based group loans by updating group-loan manuals to \ninclude improved credit underwriting processes, and developing a group-loan operational plan. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n30.  The  unmet  financial  need  for  rural  CSIs  is  estimated  at  Nu24.89  billion  (about \n$331.91 million).32 The project will result in enhanced access to finance for rural CSIs that \notherwise would only have access to informal sources of finance.33 The project will directly benefit \nat least 63,714 rural CSI borrowers, of which 50% are owned by women by 2024, by providing \nreliable and affordable institutional finance. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n31.  BDB has a sustainability risk because of high NPLs. The BDB institutional strengthening \nplan has a special focus on resolving and controlling NPLs. The credit line for the $15 million \nsubordinated debt from the government to BDB is qualified as tier 2 capital, thus contributing to \nthe  improvement  of  BDB\u2019s  capital  adequacy  ratio  and  financial  sustainability.34 The  BDB \ninstitutional strengthening plan implementation especially in relation to NPL management will be \nclosely monitored by ADB through quarterly reports and periodical review missions. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n32.  ADB  requirements  and  policies  on  financial  management,  procurement,  and \nenvironmental and social safeguards were discussed and agreed with the government and BDB \nand incorporated in the project design. Procurement of goods, works, and non-consultancy \nservices  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and relevant \nstaff instructions. Procurement will be undertaken by the individual beneficiary; fitness for purpose \ncan be achieved by using established private sector and commercial practices. \n \n33.  The overall financial management risk for the project is assessed high. BDB has (i) \ninadequate  financial  management  practices  and  lacks  an  accounting  policy  and  financial \nmanagement guidelines, (ii) weak internal control systems, (iii) poor portfolio management and \nhigh NPL ratio, and (iv) limited institutional expertise to undertake rural CSI financing. ADB\u2019s \nintegrity due diligence found that BDB\u2019s weak management information systems and internal \ncontrols and the lack of an appropriate supervision and oversight accountability mechanism pose \nsignificant integrity risks. Deficiencies in BDB\u2019s anti-money laundering/combatting the financing \n \n32 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Informal sources of finance refer to money lenders, relatives, and friends. Informal money lenders typically charge \nannual interest rates of more than 120%. \n34 Tier 2 capital is the second layer of capital that a bank must keep as part of its required reserves. This tier comprises \nrevaluation reserves, general provisions, subordinated term debt, and hybrid capital instruments. \n ", "11 \nof terrorism (AML/CFT) system also pose a significant integrity risk.35 ADB\u2019s financial due \ndiligence  identified  cases  of  misappropriation,  embezzlement,  unauthorized  sanctions  and \ndisbursements, overwriting of field receipts, backdating errors in field receipts, and failure of \nupdating account records of funds collected in fields. BDB has initiated measures to improve its \ninternal controls. The BDB institutional strengthening plan will enhance internal audit and fraud \ncontrol. Furthermore, BDB committed to undertaking measures to address the risks outlined in \nTable 6. The significant integrity risks are mitigated through the attached TA, which will support \nthe development of BDB\u2019s internal control and compliance framework, including AML/CFT.36 \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  BDB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM.  \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The project will have positive economic empowerment impacts on rural small and marginal \nfarmers and women. The project\u2019s non-collateral-based group loans will be gender-inclusive and \nthe financial literacy training and business development support will focus on women. This will \nresult in increased financial access for at least 31,857 rural CSIs owned by women, including at \nleast 3,247 women group-loan borrowers by 2024. The project is classified gender equity as a \ntheme.37 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows: 38 \n \n36.  Environment (category FI), involuntary resettlement (category FI-C), indigenous \npeoples (category FI-C). BDB will not finance subprojects with significant environmental impacts \n(category A), involuntary resettlement impacts (category A or B), or indigenous peoples impacts \n(category A or B).39 For subprojects with environmental impacts that are not significant (category \nB), BDB will prepare an initial environmental examination and environmental management plan, \nand submit the appropriate plan for ADB\u2019s approval before the subproject is financed. \n  \n37.  BDB has an environmental and social safeguard policy, but lacked a system to screen \nprojects.40 BDB has adopted an environmental and social management system (ESMS), which \nwas agreed by ADB. BDB\u2019s Environment and Social Safeguard Unit will monitor and report on \nthe status of ESMS implementation to ADB. The attached TA will support BDB\u2019s implementation \nof the ESMS. BDB will \n(i)  through  BDB\u2019s  branches,  screen  all  subprojects  to  be  financed  to  ensure \ncompliance with government regulations, project legal agreements, the PAM, \nenvironmental and social screening guidelines, and ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment \nActivities List; and \n \n35 ADB. 2003.
