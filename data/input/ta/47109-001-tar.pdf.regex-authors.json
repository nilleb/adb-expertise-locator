Poverty  and  inequality  profiles  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  including  in  the  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), are undergoing fundamental \nchanges as a result of unprecedented urbanization. Most DMCs face tremendous challenges \nwith  little  preparation,  including  how  to  confront  the  urbanization  of poverty  and  emerging \nincome polarization. In particular, the trend of rising inequality in the region may be related to \nrapid urbanization, as hypothesized by Nobel Laureate Simon Kuznets. \n \n2.  In general, urbanization is accompanied by flows of production factors\u2014in particular \nlabor\u2014from  the  low-productivity  rural  sector  to  high-productivity  manufacturing  and  service \nindustries. Therefore, urbanization and growth appear to be positively correlated. This implies a \nnegative correlation between poverty and urbanization, all other things being equal. However, \nthe  work  of  Kuznets  postulates  that  the  relationship  between  inequality  and  growth  or \nurbanization takes the form of an inverted U.1 Consequently, inequality cannot be held constant \nduring rapid urbanization, and the poverty\u2013urbanization relationship is no longer deductible. In \nshort,  the  urbanization\u2013poverty\u2013inequality  triangle,  although  very  important  to  a  host  of \nstakeholders including ADB and its DMCs, is complex and intriguing. \n \n3.  Few  economic  analyses  have  been  conducted  regarding  the  urbanization\u2013poverty\u2013\ninequality relationship in the context of ADB DMCs, notwithstanding several ADB reports on \nurban issues (e.g., ADB\u2019s 2011 report on inclusive cities).2 A total of 90 publications in the \nEconlit database contain the keywords \u2015urbanization\u2016 and \u2015poverty\u2016, and 77 publications have \nthe keywords \u2015urbanization\u2016 and \u2015inequality\u2016 in their abstracts or titles.3 However, only 11 of \nthese 167 publications are related to ADB DMCs. The JSTOR database contains a total of 28 \nsuch publications, but only one is related to ADB DMCs.4  \n \n4.  There is an urgent need for an improved understanding of the urbanization\u2013poverty\u2013\ninequality relationship, especially with regard to the impacts of urbanization on poverty and \ninequality  in  ADB  DMCs  (see  para.10).  The  lack  of  accessible  knowledge  products  that \nelucidate this relationship hampers the efforts by DMCs and development institutions to fight \npoverty and promote inclusive growth. \n \n5.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will (i) identify the drivers of urbanization and \nproject  urbanization  trends,  both  within  DMCs  and  regionally;  (ii)  analyze  the  impact  of \nurbanization  on  poverty,  inequality,  and  other  socioeconomic  variables;  (iii)  explore  policy \nimplications;  and  (iv)  communicate  the  findings  through  written  materials,  conferences, \nworkshops, and seminars.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  This TA will address three unresolved development issues. First, it will examine the \ndrivers of urbanization in Asia and the Pacific: industrialization, rural\u2013urban disparity, education, \nglobalization, migration and rural\u2013urban linkages, and other forces (e.g., the diversity of services \navailable in cities). This will serve as a background component of the TA, and will enable more \nreliable projections of urbanization trends, both for major DMCs and for the region. Second, it \n                                                \n1  S. Kuznets. 1955. Economic Growth and Income Inequality. American Economic Review. 45 (1) pp. 1\u201328. \n2  F. Steinberg and M. Lindfield, eds. 2011. Inclusive Cities. Manila: Asian Development Bank.  \n3  Econlit is the database of the American Economic Association.  http://www.ebscohost.com/academic/econlit. \n4  JSTOR is an online repository of digitized academic journals, books, and other research materials. http://jstor.org.    \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 5 November 2013.  \n ", "2 \n \nwill examine the consequences of unprecedented urbanization (current and projected) for the \nregion  and  individual  DMCs,  focusing  on  poverty  (income  and  non-income)  and  income \ndistribution impacts. In this context it may be possible to consider gender issues, such as the \ngender composition of migrants and the gender wage gap among migrant workers. Third, it will \nexplore evidence-based policy implications and develop recommendations, which are essential \nto aid decision making by governments, donors, and development institutions, including ADB.  \n \n7.  The first issue\u2014the drivers of urbanization\u2014may sound familiar. However, it has been \nfound that limited attention has been paid to the drivers of urbanization in the economics \nliterature.6 The shortage of knowledge regarding the drivers of urbanization and their numerical \nimpacts undermines the quality of urbanization projections, which are essential for development \nplanning by DMCs and multilateral development banks. In other words, identifying drivers of \nurbanization and undertaking urbanization projection can provide vital information for policy-\nmaking of development institutions and DMC governments. \n \n8.  The  second  issue\u2014the  consequences  of  unprecedented  urbanization\u2014can  be \naddressed by analyzing (separately and jointly) the nexuses between urbanization and poverty, \nand urbanization and inequality. In studying the urbanization\u2013poverty nexus it is necessary to \ninvestigate the impact of urbanization on growth first. The impact of growth on poverty can then \nbe quantified, at least by using poverty elasticities of growth. Similarly, the distributional impact \nof  urbanization  can  be  quantified  by  using  the  inequality  elasticities  of  urbanization,  after \nestimating the inequality\u2013urbanization model. In addressing the second issue, special effort will \nbe made to consider the significant heterogeneity across DMCs. In countries such as Thailand, \nboth urbanization and extreme poverty levels are low. The opposite is true in countries such as \nMongolia. However, in some countries, low poverty levels are associated with a high level of \nurbanization, while others have high levels of poverty and a low level of urbanization. Such \nheterogeneity also exists with respect to urbanization and inequality. \n \n9.  Finally, to derive policy recommendations, reviews of policies\u2014including those designed \nto restrain urbanization, such as the hukou (household registration) system in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC)\u2014will be undertaken, and the roles of governance and institutions will \nbe explored. The empirical analyses discussed above are also expected to generate policy \nrecommendations. For example, in a country where urbanization is found to lag behind the level \nof development (e.g., the PRC), research can be conducted to explore policy options to facilitate \nmigration  and  urban  expansion.  As  another  example,  if  urbanization  is  found  to  increase \ninequality  in  a  country,  research  can  examine  whether  this  impact  forms  part  of  the \nurbanization-related growth regularity. If not, interventions such as social protection or capacity \nbuilding (e.g., training programs for migrants) may be suggested to contain or eliminate the \nadverse impact of urbanization on inequality. \n \n10.  The issues to be addressed by this TA have received growing interest from both inside \nand outside ADB. During the Key Indicators workshop held in May 2012, coping with the \nunexpected scale and pace of urbanization was one of the concerns expressed by government \nrepresentatives. After the launch of Key Indicators 2012,7 ADB\u2019s urban community of practice, \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), and Southeast Asia Department \n                                                \n6  A.

Manila.  \n ", "  3 \napproached  the  Economics  and  Research  Department  (ERD)  for  follow-up  studies  on \nurbanization in the region.  \n \n11.  The proposed TA complements a number of completed or ongoing ADB studies. The \nspecial chapter of Key Indicators 2012 focused on the urbanization\u2013environment relationship, \nwith research support from the 2011 Key Indicators TA.8 This TA will focus on the urbanization\u2013\npoverty\u2013inequality interrelationship. This TA also complements two East Asia Department TA \nprojects: one aims to establish an urban regional knowledge hub in the PRC, while the other \nfocuses on providing basic infrastructure, employment, and social services within the PRC.9 \nBoth are largely descriptive, while the proposed TA emphasizes analytical work with quantitative \nresults. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be improved understanding of stakeholders regarding the \nurbanization\u2013poverty\u2013inequality  interrelationship.  The  outcome  will  be  that  policy  makers, \ndevelopment experts, and researchers both within and outside ADB use the TA findings. The \nTA outputs include: research papers on drivers of urbanization and urbanization projections, \nresearch papers or reports on urbanization\u2013poverty\u2013inequality triangle, and dissemination of \nknowledge products on the urbanization\u2013poverty\u2013inequality interrelationship.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  This is an economic research project on urbanization, and econometric modeling will be \nthe primary methodology used to address the three issues (para. 6). However, methods from \nother relevant disciplines such as urban planning, economic geography, and demography will \nalso be considered when appropriate. Both country-specific and comparative (multi-country) \ncase studies will be conducted. Literature and policy reviews will also be undertaken. \n \n14.  A comparative approach will be employed to analyze urbanization drivers and impacts \nand the associated policy implications in two or more DMCs (e.g., the PRC and India). Possible \ntopics for the comparative study include the impacts of urbanization on urban and rural growth; \ndistortions  in  land  markets  and  related  housing  issues;  distortions  in  labor  markets  and \nimplications for migration, remittance, and equity; external markets (trade and foreign direct \ninvestments) and urbanization; financing for infrastructure and public services; urbanization and \nhuman development; and environmental challenges and urbanization. The role of social capital \nin the urbanization process will be considered if data are available. \n \n15.  In identifying urbanization drivers, both time series models and structural models will be \nspecified  and  estimated  by  ordinary  least  squares,  generalized  least  squares,  generalized \nmethod of moments, or other panel data techniques. Once the empirical models have been \ndeveloped, the TA will make projections of the level of urbanization in various DMCs and in the \nregion.10 Such  projections  are  likely  to  differ  from  those  produced  by  the  United  Nations \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

Because the definition of urban areas differs among countries, the United Nations urbanization data \n ", "4 \n \nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division or the United Nations Human \nSettlements Programme, which heavily rely on pure time-series, rather than structural models. \n \n16.  To tackle the urbanization\u2013poverty\u2013inequality triangle, this TA intends to assess the \nimpacts  of  urbanization  on  income  or  non-income  poverty  and  inequality.  The  specific \nmethodologies to be used may include: (i) pair-wise correlation analysis between urbanization, \npoverty, and inequality; (ii) vector autoregressive modeling of the interrelationship between \nurbanization, poverty, and inequality; and (iii) use of discrete choice models such as logit or \nprobit for quantifying the impacts of internal migration on poverty and possibly inequality. \n \n17.  Based on the various models that are constructed and estimated, simulations can be \nused to assess the potential impacts of policy changes. The simulations can be conducted at \nthe country, subregional, or regional level depending on data availability. \n \n18.  Both macro and micro or household survey data will be collected, processed, and used \nin this TA. The open data practice will be adopted whenever allowed by data providers. Country \ncoverage depends on data availability. The DMCs likely to be included are: the PRC, India, \nIndonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Uzbekistan.11 No \nactivity will be financed in any participating DMC unless a no objection letter is obtained from \nthe DMC government. \n \n19.  Workshops, seminars, conferences, and/or launch activities will be conducted to present \nand discuss the findings of the TA. Experts from ADB and other relevant institutions will be \ninvited as resource persons to these events. Government representatives will also be invited to \nvarious project activities to seek their inputs and discuss research findings. The TA will finance \ntheir participation. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  TA.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  by  the \nDevelopment Indicators and Policy Research Division of ERD for 24 months, from December \n2013 to December 2015. ERD\u2019s poverty and inclusive growth group, together with RSDD, will \ncollaborate to implement the TA, including the recruitment and management of consultants. \nDuring TA implementation, the project team will collaborate with ADB\u2019s communities of practice, \nRSDD,  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration,  and  regional  departments.  For  example, \nongoing TA projects of the South Asia12 and East Asia (through the ADB\u2013Tongji University \nKnowledge-Hub for Sustainable Urban Development)13 departments provide good opportunities \nfor collaborative research.  \n                                                                                                                                                       \nmay be inconsistent; this can be addressed through econometric techniques, such as fixed effects models and \ndata differencing. \n11 The list of countries will be finalized after data availability is reviewed. \n12 ADB. 2012.

External collaborations are being developed with Centers of Excellence: the Fudan Lab \nfor China Development Studies, the University of Oxford, and the London School of Economics.  \n \n23.  The TA is expected to finance up to 89 person-months of consulting services. In addition \nto the comparative studies (para. 14), the consultants will study a combination of different \nthemes, issues, and DMCs. Some will focus on cross-country research while others will conduct \ncountry case studies. Given the large number of countries covered in this TA and the meager \nliterature on the urbanization\u2013poverty\u2013inequality triangle, the following allocation is proposed. \nThe comparative cross-country studies will be conducted by international consultants: nine \neconomists (13.5 person-months), three urban development specialists (4.5 person-months), \nand two social development specialists (3 person-months). The country-specific case studies \nwill be conducted by national consultants: eight country economists (16 person-months) and two \ncountry social development specialists (4 person-months). The research teams will be assisted \nby an economics editor (national, 12 person-months) and two research assistants (national, 36 \nperson-months). The TA will also make provision for the participation of resource persons (2 \nperson-months)  who  will  provide  technical  inputs  and  guidance  during  the  workshops, \nconferences, seminars, or launch activities. Each resource person assignment will not exceed \n10  working  days.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  and  engaged  individually  by  ADB  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).14 The scope of work and outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n24.  The TA requires both micro and macro data. The datasets will be procured from DMC \nagencies as well as other research institutions. Equipment and software may also be procured \nfor the TA where needed. Procurement of data, equipment, and software will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursement of \nfunds will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). For the equipment, a certificate of equipment turnover or disposal \nwill be submitted at the end of the TA implementation.  \n \n25.  Findings  will  be  disseminated  through  workshops,  seminars,  conferences,  launch \nactivities, and various publications. Evaluation will be based on knowledge products produced \nand feedback from stakeholders. Briefings and seminars will also be conducted to disseminate \nresearch findings to the operations departments and outsiders. Informal review meetings by the \nTA  team,  including  consultants,  will  be  held  to  address  constraints  and  monitor  activities \naccording to the schedule. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis for \nThe Urbanization\u2013Poverty\u2013Inequality Triangle in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n14 The outputs of individual consultants are independent. There will be no subcontracting or purchase of expensive \nitems under individual consultant contracts.
