Rationale for SDPL-Subprogram II Design    66\n ", "  \n \n \nLOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY \nBorrower  The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \n   \nThe Proposal  The  proposal  comprises  a  proposed  loan  of  $20  million  for \nSubprogram II of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nProgram Loan (SDPL). SDPL takes a cluster approach and consists \nof two back-to-back subprograms. All policy conditions of SDPL-\nSubprogram I were complied with in October 2006. \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSectors: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Economic management \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, private sector development, \ngovernance \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets, \npolicy/institutional/legal/regulatory reforms, financial and economic \ngovernance \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nSocial Sector  Involuntary resettlement \u2013 Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people \u2013 Category C \n   \nThe Program   There is consensus among the Government, the Asian Development \nRationale  Bank (ADB), and the aid community on the urgent need to support \nthe development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to \nsustain economic growth and to progressively reduce the incidence \nof poverty in Viet Nam. The traditional approach to assisting SME \ndevelopment, which aimed to fill SMEs' funding and technical gaps \nthrough  provision  of  subsidized  credit  or  services,  has achieved \nlimited results, and is often considered unsustainable. Increasingly, \ntherefore,  SME  support  programs  are  shifting  to  creation  of  an \nenabling business environment. \n \nThe SDPL Cluster is ADB\u2019s first policy loan in Viet Nam specifically \ndesigned to foster an enabling environment for the SME sector as a \nkey means for poverty reduction. Building from the achievements of \nSubprogram I, Subprogram II adopts a process-oriented approach \nand is designed to systematically identify and resolve issues and \nconstraints  on business,  particularly  on  SMEs,  through \nintergovernmental coordination and stakeholder consultation.  \n \nThe ADB Board approved SDPL\u2019s cluster concept and Subprogram I \nfor  $60  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  on  21 \nSeptember 2004. Subprogram I achieved concrete outputs, and all \nSubprogram  I  second  tranche  release  conditions  had  been  fully \ncomplied with by October 2006. The Government has shown solid \ncommitment to the reform program and is ready to continue with \nSubprogram II.   ", "ii    \n \n \nSubprogram  II,  building  on  achievements  of  Subprogram  I,  will \ncontinue to support the Government\u2019s effort to create an enabling \nbusiness environment in Viet Nam, which is facing challenges due to \ndeficiencies  common  to  developing  economies  in  transition.  In \nselecting areas to be covered by the SDPL, priority was given to \nthose  assessed  to  be  (i)  significant  for  SMEs'  current  business \noperations, (ii) backed by Government commitment to reform in line \nwith best practices, (iii) linked to ADB's past and ongoing operations, \nand (iv) complementary to activities of other aid agencies. \n \nMany measures adopted under the SDPL support the Government \nin undertaking market-friendly interventions and eliminating policy \nbias against SMEs, thus strengthening the environment for private \nsector development. Beneficiaries of such measures are expected to \ninclude the poor. \n   \nObjective and  The objective of the SDPL is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to \nScope  create a business environment that is conducive to economic growth \nand employment generation. To achieve this objective, the SDPL \nfocuses on the following: \n \n(i)  Enhancing  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework.  The \nProgram aims to (a) improve the business registration and \nlicensing  systems  by  implementing  uniform,  consistent \nregistration  procedures  nationwide,  and  streamlining \nbusiness  licensing  procedures;  (b)  establish  the \nGovernment\u2019s institutional framework for SME development \nand for effective monitoring and evaluation of the sector; \nand (c) promote closer public-private sector partnership and \nproviding systems that make information on the regulations \non  enterprises  accessible  to  the  public.  Policies  and \nprograms will be based on a comprehensive SME sector \ndatabase  and  a  coordinated  SME  development  policy \nstrategy. \n \n(ii)  Improving SMEs\u2019 access to resources (finance and land \nuse rights). The SDPL aims to (a) reduce the costs and \nrisks of lending to SMEs by developing an SME accounting \nsystem, establishing land registration and valuation methods \nto improve the use of land use rights certificates (LURCs) as\ncollateral, and supporting the use of movable properties as \ncollateral  through  a  functioning  secured  transactions \nregistry; (b) improve the operational environment of financial \nleasing  companies  by  expanding  the  types  of  leasing \nproducts  and  diversifying  their  funding  source;  and  (c) \ncomplete  legal  and  institutional  frameworks  for  market-\nbased transactions on land by establishing the legal basis \nfor  issuance  of  LURCs,  making  information  on  land \naccessible to the public, and promoting good governance in \nadministrative procedures. \n ", "   iii\n \n \n(iii)  Facilitating  SMEs\u2019  access  to  international  markets \n(industrial/technical standards). The SDPL aims to lower \nthe structural barrier on industrial and technical standards \nfor SMEs by (a) completing the legal framework on industrial\nand  technical  standards,  (b)  undertaking  institutional \nreforms  of  certification  bodies  and  ensuring  SME \nrepresentation  in  setting  standards,  and  (c)  making \ninformation on standards readily available to the public. The \noverall objective is to make the standards more transparent. \n \nThe Program Framework is in Appendix 1. SDPL-Subprogram II is \ndesigned to continue the reforms initiated in Subprogram I and its \nmain benefits are to (i) improve key legal and regulatory structure; \n(ii)  facilitate  greater  transparency  through  improved  information \nflows;  (iii)  enhance  policy  structure  through  stakeholder \nconsultation  and  feedback  in  policy  formulation;  (iv)  improve \ngovernance  through  private  sector  monitoring  of  business \nenvironment (and its indicators) and performance of regulatory and \nadministrative  agencies;  and  (v)  engage  third-party  regulatory \nreviews  that  reinforce  the  above.  These  positive  elements \nincorporated in the SDPL-Subprogram II will increasingly be felt as \nthe existing systems are transformed and modernized to better \nsupport  a  progressively  market-oriented  economy.  Successful \nimplementation will form the basis for further developing the private \nsector in Viet Nam.  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  Subprogram II of SDPL will comprise a loan of $20 million to be \ndrawn from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The loan will have \na repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand will carry an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Subprogram II of SDPL is \nproposed to be cofinanced by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD)  of  France  for  \u20ac13  million,  and  by  KfW  Entwicklungsbank \n(KfW) of Germany for \u20ac6 million.  \n   \nProgram Period and   Subprogram  II  will  be  implemented  within  18  months  after  loan \nTranching  effectiveness.  The  $20  million  loan  for  Subprogram  II  will  be \nreleased in a single tranche. Implementation of Subprogram II is \nplanned for 1 January 2007 to 1 July 2008. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will be the Executing \nAgency for Subprogram II of the SDPL. The implementing agencies \ninclude the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Justice (MOJ), \nMinistry  of  Science  and  Technology  (MOST),  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environment  (MONRE),  and  the  State  Bank  of \nVietnam (SBV).  \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the SDPL-Subprogram II will be disbursed for a \nbroad range of imports, subject to a negative list of ineligible items. \nProcurement of goods and services produced in and originating from ", "iv    \n \n \nADB  member  countries  will  be  made  with  due  consideration  to \neconomy and efficiency in accordance with standard public sector \nprocedures  in  Viet  Nam  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices acceptable to ADB. The Borrower will certify that the value \nof total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) \nineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made under other official \ndevelopment assistance, is greater than the amount expected to be \ndisbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of \nthe  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower's \ncertification. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The policy framework for the SDPL-Subprogram II includes specific \ncomponents that bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The \nGovernment  has  provided  assurances  that  funding  will  be  made \navailable to cover these costs. \n   \nImplementation  To  coordinate  program  implementation  among  government \nArrangements  ministries and agencies, the program steering committee (PSC) for \nSDPL-Subprogram  I  will  be  maintained.  The  PSC,  chaired  by  a \ndeputy minister of MPI, will comprise senior officers from ministries \nand government agencies (MOF, MONRE, MOST, MOJ, and SBV). \nThe PSC will meet at least twice a year to review pending issues \nand propose concrete actions for their resolution to ensure timely \nprogram implementation. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  There are four principal risks in implementing the SDPL-Subprogram \nII. The first involves effective coordination and cooperation within the \ngovernment,  both  horizontally  among  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned, and vertically with the provincial and district authorities. \nConsultation and coordination with the private sector and the aid \ncommunity active in SME development will also be required. It is \nexpected that coordination and cooperation among all stakeholders \nwill gradually improve with the increased coordination capacity of the \nAgency for SME Development (ASMED), thus reducing the risk of \noverlap  and  inconsistencies  in  SME  support  activities.  Technical \nassistance grants (TA) in support of the SDPL implementation will \ninclude capacity building for ASMED to reduce this risk. Overall, \nwhile  coordination  among  government  agencies  significantly \nimproved during the Subprogram I implementation, it remains an \nimportant issue.  \n \nA second risk pertains to good governance of the central, provincial, \nand district governments. Governance at the provincial and district \nlevels is particularly important since the positive impact of the SDPL \nwill be felt only through effective implementation of policies at the \nground level. These risks are common to several programs and are \nbeing addressed through the implementation of the comprehensive \nPublic Administration Reform Master Program for 2001\u20132010, which \nis being supported by ADB. \n \nA  third  risk  relates  to  the  technical  capacities  of  implementing ", "   v\n \n \nagencies.  Experience  suggests  that,  given  adequate  technical \nsupport, the Government\u2019s commitment to reforms is more readily \ntranslated into effective and timely implementation. In implementing \nprevious programs, delays were caused predominantly by the lack of \ntechnical expertise and the consensus-building approach in enacting\nlaws and regulations. To reduce this risk, a series of TA projects \nfrom  ADB,  KfW,  and  AFD  have  been  implemented during \nSubprogram I, with implementing agencies at the technical level. \nAlthough  the  TA  projects  have  significantly  contributed  towards \ncapacity building, more needs to be done. \n \nThe  fourth  risk  relates  to  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nimplement the necessary reforms. The SPDL contains the issuance \nof a number of legal documents.  While a good progress has been \nmade  to  meet  the  conditions,  this  does  not  necessarily  lead  to \neffective implementation of the legal documents.  As noted above, \neffective  implementation  requires  good  capacity,  coordination \namong  key  agencies,  and  political  commitment.  For  Viet  Nam, \nhowever, such commitment seems to be clear\u2014particularly based \non the successful Subprogram I implementation. The fact that Viet \nNam is accessing to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime \nalso indicates their commitment to market-based development. The \nnew Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) also emphasizes \nthe importance of SME development. The design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) has been enhanced to ensure that ADB can \neffectively examine the implementation progress.  \n \n ", "  \n \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Subprogram II of the Small and Medium Enterprise \nDevelopment Program Loan (SDPL). \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n2.  The SDPL was approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors on \n21 October 2004.1 It comprises two subprograms for $100 million, with Subprogram I for $60 \nmillion.2 Subprogram I is to be disbursed in two tranches: (i) $25 million upon fulfillment of \nspecified first tranche release conditions upon loan effectiveness, and (ii) $35 million subject to \nfulfillment of specified second tranche release conditions approximately 18 months after loan \neffectiveness. Subprogram II will provide a loan of $20 million.3\n \n3.  The objective of the SDPL is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to create a business \nenvironment that is conducive to economic growth and employment generation. To achieve this \nobjective, the SDPL will focus on the following: \n \n(i)  Enhancing the policy and regulatory framework. The Program aims to (a) \nimprove the business registration and licensing systems by implementing uniform, \nconsistent  registration  procedures  nationwide,  and  streamlining  business \nlicensing procedures; (b) establish the Government\u2019s institutional framework for \nSME development and for effective monitoring and evaluation of the sector; and \n(c) promote closer public-private sector partnership and providing systems that \nmake information on government regulations on enterprises easily accessible to \nthe public. Policies and programs will be based on a comprehensive database on \nthe SME sector and a coordinated SME development strategy \n \n(ii)  Improving SMEs\u2019 access to resources (finance and land use rights). The \nSDPL aims to (a) reduce the costs and risks of lending to SMEs by developing an \nSME accounting system, establishing land registration and valuation methods to \nimprove  the  use  of  land  use  rights  certificates  (LURCs)  as  collateral,  and \nsupporting  the  use  of  movable  properties  as  collateral  through  a  functioning \n                                                 \n1  The Loan Agreement for the SDPL-Subprogram I was signed in November 2004. The Government\u2019s provision of a \nlegal opinion was endorsed by ADB. With the establishment of the Program Steering Committee and the Program \nImplementation Unit within MPI, the loan became effective in April 2005. ADB\u2019s first tranche release was completed \nin August 2005. \n2  There are two cofinanciers for the SDPL. Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) of France is providing \ncofinancing of \u20ac35 million\u2014\u20ac22 million for Subprogram I, and \u20ac13 million for Subprogram II. For AFD, Subprogram \nI is to be disbursed in two tranches: (i) \u20ac11 million upon fulfillment of specified first tranche release conditions, and \n(ii) \u20ac11 million subject to the fulfillment of specified second tranche release conditions. The Loan Agreement \nbetween AFD and the Government of Viet Nam was signed in November 2005. AFD\u2019s first tranche release was \ncompleted in December 2005. KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW) of Germany is providing cofinancing of \u20ac20 million\u2014\n\u20ac14 million for Subprogram I, and \u20ac6 million for Subprogram II. For KfW, Subprogram I is to be disbursed in two \ntranches: (i) \u20ac7 million upon fulfillment of specified first tranche release conditions, and (ii) \u20ac7 million subject to  the \nfulfillment of specified second tranche release conditions. The Loan Agreement for Subprogram I between KfW and \nthe Government of Viet Nam was signed in April 2005. KfW\u2019s first tranche release was completed in August 2005. \n3  Per the Government\u2019s request, a $20 million project loan for the development of the leasing industry, which was \noriginally a component of Subprogram II, will be processed separately in 2007. Through its financial sector \noperations, ADB has been supporting the Government to develop an enabling regulatory environment for the \nleasing industry. In addition, ADB has been providing assistance to the leasing industry association to support the \nindustry\u2019s capacity building.  ", "2   \n \n \nsecured transactions registry; (b) improve the operational environment of financial \nleasing companies by expanding the types of leasing products and diversifying \ntheir  funding  source;  and  (c)  complete  legal  and  institutional  frameworks  for \nmarket-based transactions on land by establishing the legal basis for issuance of \nLURCs, making information on land accessible to the public, and promoting good \ngovernance in administrative procedures.  \n \n(iii)  Facilitating  SMEs\u2019  access  to  international  markets  (industrial/technical \nstandards).  The  SDPL  aims  to  lower  the  structural  barrier  on  industrial  and \ntechnical standards for SMEs by (a) completing the legal framework on industrial \nand  technical  standards,  (b)  undertaking  institutional  reforms  of  certification \nbodies and ensuring SME representation in setting standards, and (c) making \ninformation on standards readily available to the public. \n \n4.  To support the SDPL implementation, ADB launched an advisory technical assistance \n(TA-4418: Capacity Building for SME Development) in May 2005.4 KfW began a technical \nassistance (TA) project that supports the leasing components of the SDPL in August 2005. AFD \nis expected to launch a TA project to support capacity-building efforts in regards to the technical \nstandards by December 2006.   \n \nIII.  MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n5.  Viet Nam's annual economic growth rate accelerated to an estimated 8.1% in 2005, up \nfrom 7.5% in 2004, and 7.1% in 2003. The healthy performance was achieved despite the \nadverse impact of avian influenza, drought for part of the year, a more challenging export \nmarket for clothing, and rising prices of key imported inputs. Domestic demand was the main \ncontributor to growth; exports also remained strong. Gross fixed investment continued to grow, \nreflecting improvements in the business environment. Investments accounted for 37.6% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2005, up from 29% in 1998.  \n \n6.  Market liberalization is an integral part of the country\u2019s preparations for access to the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). Official recognition of the private sector\u2019s contribution to \neconomic activity is increasingly explicit, improving the prospects for further reforms toward a \nmarket-based economy. In 2005, the National Assembly passed a new Enterprise Law (NEL) \nand  a  Common  Investment  Law,  designed  to  boost  private  investment  by  reducing \nadministrative barriers to business development and to facilitate WTO membership. Efforts to \nimprove  the  business  climate  have  helped  generate  strong  growth  in  domestic  private \ninvestment and foreign direct investment (FDI). Some 38,100 private enterprises were newly \nregistered in 2005, up from 14,400 in 2000.5 Viet Nam has about 200,000 private enterprises, \nwith  a  total  registered capital  of  about  $26  billion.6  The  improved  investment  climate  has \ncontinued to support FDI growth, with $2.4 billion in investment in the first 5 months of 2006, up \n19.7% year on year.  \n \n7.  The trade deficit narrowed to $4.5 billion in 2005, after a sharp widening in the trade gap \nin recent years. Total merchandise exports rose by 20% in value, below the 30% leap recorded \nin 2004 but still impressive and higher than the rise in imports. With continuing strong growth in \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Capacity Building for SME Development \nProgram. Manila (approved for $1,400,000 in October 2004). \n5  ADB. 2006. Asian Development Outlook 2006. Manila. \n6  Source: Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2006. ", "   3\n \n \nprivate remittances (particularly from overseas Vietnamese) and tourism receipts, the current \naccount  deficit  narrowed  to  3.6%  of  GDP  in  2005,  reversing  its  recent  trend.  Net  private \nremittances leaped by nearly $1 billion to $3.2 billion. Gross official reserves rose to $7.7 billion \nin 2005 (equivalent to about 2.6 months of imports). The Socio-Economic Development Plan \n(SEDP) for 2006\u20132010 envisages average annual GDP growth of 7.5\u20138.0%, with 3.0\u20133.2% in \nagriculture, forestry, and fisheries; 10.0\u201310.2% in industry; and 7.7\u20138.2% in services. Inflation is \nprojected to average about 5% and the current account deficit about 3% of GDP.7\n \nIV.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Analysis \n8.  SMEs are defined as businesses and production establishments that have a registered \ncapital of less than D10 billion (about $670,000) and/or fewer than 300 annual permanent \nemployees. About 165,000 enterprises have been registered under the 1999 Enterprise Law \n(EL)  since  its  enactment  in  2000.  This  number  does  not  include  the  estimated  800,000 \nregistered household and small enterprises without tax codes, or the several million informal \nhousehold  enterprises  not  obliged  to  register  at  local  government  offices.8  Of  all  formal \nenterprises, 79,420 had a registered capital of less than D10 billion (accounting for 86.6% of the \ntotal), while 88,222 had less than 300 employees (96.1% of total). Thus, based on the two \ncriteria of registered capital and average number of employees, SMEs account for more than \n86%  of  the  total  number  of  registered  enterprises.  Even  when  household  enterprises  are \nexcluded, it can be deduced that more than 86% of registered companies are SMEs.

The fastest growing segment of the formal SME sector appears to be those companies \nwith 10\u201349 employees, which grew from 30.3% of total SMEs in 2000 to 36.8% in 2004. In 2004, \nformal SMEs (defined as enterprises with fewer than 300 employees) were concentrated mainly \nin services and commerce (60.5% of total SMEs), followed by industry and construction (37% of \ntotal). The industry and construction subsector has attracted the largest number of new SMEs \n                                                 \n7  The macroeconomic assessment from the IMF will be submitted to the Board separately. \n8  The Establishments Census conducted by the General Statistics Office in 2003 showed that Viet Nam had more \nthan 2.7 million business establishments engaging over 8.3 million people in 2002. ", "4   \n \n \nsince 2000, growing from 32.9% of total SMEs in 2000 to 37% in 2004. Since 2004, the SME \nsector has continued to grow as the private sector has gained increasing importance in the \neconomy. In 2004, the private sector produced 70% of the country\u2019s non-oil exports, 27% of \ntotal investment, and absorbed 39% of domestic bank credit.9 The private sector has also \nconsistently outpaced the state-owned enterprise (SOE) and foreign-invested sector in terms of \nindustrial output growth, with output growing at 22.2% in 2004 and 24.1% in 2005. The exact \npercentage of SMEs as a component of the private sector is not systematically recorded, but it \nis generally accepted to be around 90% of registered enterprises. Viet Nam continues to have \none of the world\u2019s highest rates of export growth, with non-oil exports rising 30.2% in 2004 and \n20% in 2005. Non-oil exports accounted for 61.3% of GDP in 2005, up from 47.6% in 2002. \nWhile the percentage of exports produced by SMEs is not tracked by official statistics, surveys \nhave suggested that it remains small, with the vast majority of firms with fewer than 100 \nemployees  producing  exclusively  for  the  domestic  sector.  Finally,  the  Ministry  of  Trade \nsuggested that, as of October 2004, the SMEs accounted for 84.2% of the total number of \nexporting enterprises (data on export value is not available). \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Key Issues \n10.  Based on the in-depth analysis undertaken while preparing for the SDPL in 2004, and \nbased on lessons learned while implementing Subprogram I, the following major challenges \nfacing the sector have been identified.  \n \n11.  Lack of a National SME Development Plan and Coordination Framework. In view of \nthe multidimensional constraints of SMEs that cut across different sectors and mandates of \ngovernment ministries and agencies, SME development requires vision, strategic direction, as \nwell  as  effective  coordination  between  the  different  stakeholders  in  policy  delivery,  both \nhorizontally as well as vertically. No overall national development plan has existed to fulfil these \nfunctions in the past; support programs remain uncoordinated and often overlap, thus reducing \ntheir impact. With a view to developing an enabling policy and regulatory environment, it is \ntherefore important to establish the Government\u2019s policy and institutional framework for SME \ndevelopment through a coordinated, public-private partnership. \n \n12.  Incomplete and Inconsistent Business Registration and Licensing System. While \nthe EL simplified business registration by reducing time, costs, and documentation requirements, \nnewly issued guidelines and interpretations by the local authorities, which are not in line with the \nEL, have brought further complications for entering the market. Similarly, while the number of \nlicenses was reduced after passing the EL, a range of new licenses has emerged, bringing the \ntotal documented number to 298 licenses and sublicenses.10 This increase in licenses imposes \na substantial burden on SMEs as well as on government administration. There is a clear need \nfor rationalizing existing licenses while applying procedural approaches that ensure more careful \nissuance of new licenses. This can now be achieved with the passage of the NEL. At the same \ntime, the business registration process requires streamlining, combined with an expansion of \nthe  National  Business  Information  System  (NBIN)  to  incorporate  all  provinces,  to  provide \n                                                 \n9  Sources: Vietnam Development Report 2006. Joint Donor Report to the Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting; \nGovernment report presented by Standing Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to the 7th Session of the 8th \nNational Assemble. 5 May 2005 (reprinted in the Viet Nam Business Forum Report on 1 June 2005); and State \nBank of Vietnam. \n10  For this RRP, the term \u2018license\u2019 is based on the definition as provided in the NEL.   ", "   5\n \n \ninformation to both public and private sector on licensing. These joint activities will contribute to \nan improved business environment.  \n \n13.  Limited Access to Financial and Physical Resources. Access to finance remains one \nof the most significant problems for SMEs. The financial sector, which is used to lending to \nSOEs with Government guarantees, still perceives financing for SMEs to be costly and highly \nrisky. While collateral is an important means to access finance, the limited access to LURCs \nreduces its use for collateral purpose. This will require a completion of the corresponding legal \nand regulatory framework under which LURCs are issued and a streamlining and unification of \nregistration procedures of subsequent transactions. Moreover, to support banks in pricing the \ncollateral, price valuation methods of land need to be updated to conform to market principles \nand to reflect actual market values. SMEs\u2019 access to finance will be further enhanced by an \neffective secured transactions registry that clearly establishes the prioritization of creditors\u2019 and \nlien  holders\u2019  rights  while  registering.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  collateral  is  compounded  by \nunreliable financial information on SMEs. Financial reporting requirements are felt to be overly \ncomplex and difficult to comply with. This situation needs to be alleviated by introducing a \nsimplified SME accounting system that adheres to the International Accounting Standards (IAS).  \n \n2.  Government Objectives and Strategy \n14.  The Government's development goals and poverty reduction targets are stated in the \nSEDP (2006-2010), various sector strategies, and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth  Strategy  (CPRGS).  The  CPRGS  targets  reduction  of  poverty  incidence  by \napproximately 12% between 2001 and 2010 through increased efficiency in resource use, social \nprogress and equity in income distribution, and development of corruption-free and efficient \nstate functions.  \n  \n15.  To support the private sector, the Government issued Decree 90/2001/ND-CP\u2013\u2013Support \nfor Development of SMEs (Decree 90)\u2013\u2013in November 2001 and officially recognized SMEs for \nthe first time in Viet Nam. Decree 90 provides a framework for the Government to support and \nencourage private sector development and covers the establishment of (i) an SME Promotion \nCouncil with cross-ministry membership to act as an advisory body to the Prime Minister, and (ii) \nASMED in MPI to coordinate SME-related activities. \n \n16.  To further support Government initiatives for private sector development, the SDPL \nprovides  assistance  for  (i)  completing  the  supporting  legal  and  policy  frameworks;  (ii) \nestablishing  efficient  mechanisms  for  coordination  among  various  government  ministries, \nagencies, and other stakeholders including the private sector; and (iii) effectively implementing \ncurrent legal and policy measures at the central, provincial, and local levels.   \n \n17.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  expected  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  marks  a \nhistorical milestone in its long-lasting and continuous endeavor for integration to the global \neconomy,  since  the  launch  of  Doi  Moi  in  1986  and  the  country\u2019s  initial  application  for \nmembership in 1995. Upon completion of the ratification process, Viet Nam will be part of the \nmultilateral trading system, under which trade policy in goods and services and protection of \ntrade-related aspects of intellectual property rights are pursued in a transparent and, in principle, \nnon-discriminatory manner. Accordingly, the WTO accession is both timely and consistent with \nthe SDPL\u2019s overall objective of fostering an enabling environment for the enterprises. The \ncountry will also have access to WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system and trade policy review \nmechanism. \n ", "6   \n \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank's Strategy and Operations in the Sector \n18.  The SDPL Cluster was originally included in ADB\u2019s lending program for Viet Nam to \naddress a strategic priority set under the 2002\u20132004 country strategy and program (CSP),11 \nnamely, improving the business environment for private sector development, with a focus on \ndomestic SMEs. On account of critical roles of private sector and SMEs for business-led and \npro-poor economic growth, the CSP (2007\u20132010)12 continuously addresses establishment of an \nenabling environment for enterprises operating in Viet Nam, through proposed support for \neffective implementation of the NEL and the Common Investment Law.13\n \n4.  External Assistance to the Sector \n19.  External assistance to SMEs in Viet Nam started in the mid-1990s. In addition to ADB, \nmajor  multilateral  funding  agencies  active  in  SME  development  include  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP),  United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization \n(UNIDO), and the World Bank Group. More specifically, UNDP and UNIDO have worked closely \nwith the Government on implementing Decree 90 and a number of aspects related to the EL. \nThe World Bank, in coordination with ADB and a number of bilateral sources, has put in place a \ncomprehensive package of reforms under its Poverty Reduction and Support Credit.   \n \n20.  Bilateral aid agencies from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, \nFrance, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the \nUnited Kingdom, and the United States (US) are also active. Appendix 6 presents a matrix of \naid activities in the SME sector, spread across (i) policy and institutional support; (ii) legal and \nregulatory enhancement; (iii) human resource development, such as vocational and training \ncenters; (iv) line of credit for SMEs; and (v) business development services. Despite diverse \nassistance, there has been limited policy-based lending support (other than the SDPL) for \nspecifically developing the sector in Viet Nam. ADB closely coordinates with these agencies to \nmaximize synergies where possible, and avoid duplication of efforts.   \n \n5.  Lessons  \n21.  ADB's past operations in SME development suggest a number of key lessons.  \n \n(i)  For program loans, commitment of the developing member country (DMC) is \ncrucial  for  successful  outcomes.  Merely  passing  legislative  and  regulatory \nchanges to satisfy ADB conditions does not guarantee successful outcomes. \n \n(ii)  Programs must provide sufficient flexibility to allow for rapidly changing economic \nand political conditions.  \n \n(iii)  The focus of SME development should be on fostering an enabling business \nenvironment.  The  traditional  approach  to  assisting  SME  development,  which \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2001. Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132004): Viet Nam. Manila. \n12  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila. \n13  The new CSP specifically illuminates areas of policy reforms that validate ADB\u2019s assistance, including: (i) further \ndevelopment of the national business registration system, and streamlining the business licensing system; (ii) \npolicy and institutional reforms to complete the Government\u2019s framework for private sector and SME development; \n(iii) enhancement of financial disclosure through development of a simplified accounting system for SMEs; and (iv) \nnecessary policy initiatives to enhance access to finance through efficient use of land, fixed assets, and movable \nproducts as collaterals. These are fully reflected in the design of Subprogram II of the SDPL Cluster. ", "   7\n \n \naimed to fill SMEs' funding and technical gaps through provision of subsidized \ncredit or services, has achieved limited results\u2014and is oftentimes considered \nunsustainable.14 \n \n22.  Distinct features of the SDPL, which address shortcomings of ADB's past operations for \nSME development, include the consultative approach taken throughout its formulation. A series \nof workshops for each component was organized with a view to achieving commitment from the \nGovernment  and  stakeholders.  For  the  SDPL  to  maintain  its  relevance  throughout  its \nimplementation period, it was approved as a program cluster modality, which would allow \noperational flexibility and adjusting to changing economic and political conditions. \n \n23.  The SDPL formulation also reflects the lessons learned from other donor projects. Often, \nthe projects have been scattered without much coordination. Such projects can be duplicative \nand overlapping. Therefore, it was important to have a roadmap, which facilitates a close \ncoordination of among the Government, donor agencies, and other stakeholders. The SME \nRoadmap,  which  became  the  basis  for  the  SME  policy  strategy,  was  supported  by  ADB.  \nFurther, as ADB is serving as a co-chair for the SME Working Group (a donor\u2013Government \nworking group), there have been significant improvements in coordination.   \n \nV.  SDPL-SUBPROGRAM I\u2014STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION \nA.  Program Implementation  \n24.  The following section details the progress and achievements of Subprogram I. Further \ndetails are provided in Appendix 8. Appendix 1 provides measurable targets and indicators of \nthe major development impacts. ADB will continue to identify an appropriate set of indicators for \nthe impact evaluation based on consultation with the Government.  \n \n1.  Improved Business Licensing and Registration Systems \n25.  The SDPL-Subprogram I supported the improvement of the regulatory environment for \nSMEs by (i) introducing a more rigorous process for business licensing, and (ii) facilitating \nbusiness  registration.  The  EL  of  1999  shifted  the  paradigm  of  business  registration  and \nlicensing from permitting companies to carry out only certain activities, to allowing companies to \nengage freely in all activities not expressly prohibited by law. The EL concurrently abolished \nmore  than  150  business  licenses  and  introduced  a  one-stop  registration  system  that \ndramatically simplified the registration process.\n \n26.  Keeping business registration and licensing processes simple and ensuring consistent \nand  fair  implementation  of  the  processes  have  reduced  uncertainty,  risks,  and  costs  for \nbusinesses. However, developments prior to Subprogram I showed some reversals from earlier \nmeasures simplifying business registration and licensing requirements. In terms of licensing, the \nbenefits of eliminating more than 150 license requirements with the promulgation of the EL were \nmitigated by the issuance of a large number of new business licenses. The Task Force for the \nEnforcement of the Enterprise Law (Task Force) identified 80 remaining licenses that contradict \nthe spirit of the EL and recommended their removal. To date, only three of these license \n                                                 \n14  The lessons learned from other donor agencies are similar. The World Bank, for example, suggests that lines of \ncredit have only a 50% success rate It suggests that credit lines are effective when the overall business \nenvironment accommodates for SME development.

", "8   \n \n \nrequirements have been removed due to continued resistance from issuing ministries. As of \nMarch 2006, Viet Nam had about 300 business license requirements in effect.  \n \n27.  With the promulgation of the NEL in November 2005, the Government has laid the \nfoundation for fundamental licensing reform, thereby complying with the SDPL-Subprogram I \nCondition (2-1). Article 7 of the NEL further restricts the issuance of business licenses,15 and \nrequires that both new and existing business licenses be reviewed and evaluated for regulatory \nmerit,  only  after  which  they  are  to  be  considered  effective.16  This  process  will  allow  the \nGovernment to exercise greater control over the quality and number of license requirements, \nand will protect enterprises from having to secure \u201cunofficial\u201d licenses.  \n \n28.  The NEL establishes the policy framework for fundamental licensing reform. The impact \nof  these  reforms,  however,  will  be  largely  dependent  on  the  viability  of  the  institutional \nmechanisms and procedures developed for their implementation. ADB will further support the \nGovernment in this implementation effort through Subprogram II of the SDPL. \n \n29.  In the area of business registration, Subprogram I supported the adoption of increased \nuniformity in procedures for business registration throughout Viet Nam. The EL of 1999, which \nsimplified the registration process, reduced registration barriers by minimizing time, document \nrequirements, and costs; and eliminating minimum capital requirements. Regardless, the costs \nof market entry in Viet Nam remain high. On average, launching a business in Viet Nam takes \nmore than 50 days and 11 steps, at a cost equal to 51% of gross national income (GNI) per \ncapita.  While  this  is  on  par  with  the  regional  average  of  52.5  days  and  8.0  steps,  it  is \nsubstantially more than the average 19.5 days and 6.5 steps in the OECD.17 Sometimes \nadditional steps must be completed before lodging the required application forms. As such, \nprocessing  times  can  be  significantly  longer  than  the  statistics  suggest.  Accordingly, \nSubprogram II has identified further measures to improve the registration\u2019s procedures and \nrequirements.  \n \n30.  Despite genuine public and government interest in improving the registration process, \nturning theory into practice has proven difficult, as the issues cut across local, national, and \nagency jurisdictions and include complex legal and technical considerations. The registration \nprocess remains fragmented, without a vertically integrated business registration organization or \nsupporting information systems. This in turn undermines national oversight and makes it more \ndifficult for the provincial and district registration offices to accomplish their assigned tasks. The \nNEL addresses this weakness by calling for greater information sharing between business \nregistration  offices  as  well  as  other  regulating  agencies.  Critical  to  the  successful \nimplementation of these reforms will be the support of a national business registration database \nand management information system, and expansion of the National Business Information \nNetwork (NBIN). The plan for the NBIN expansion has been supported through Subprogram I \nCondition (2-2).  \n \n                                                 \n15  Article 7 expressly prohibits ministries, People\u2019s Committees, and People\u2019s Councils of all echelons from issuing \nregulations relating to business conditions, i.e., business licenses. \n16 Specifically, Article 7 requires line ministries and local governments to (i) review and examine periodically business \nconditions in order to annul or recommend annulling any business condition that is no longer necessary, (ii) amend \nor recommend amending any business condition that is no longer appropriate, and (iii) issue or recommend issuing \nnew business conditions necessary to the requirement of state management. \n17 Source: World Bank. 2006. Doing Business 2006. Washington, DC. ", "   9\n \n \n2.  Establishment of the Government\u2019s Policy and Institutional Framework for \nSME Development \n31.  The SDPL has been supporting the development of an effective policy and institutional \nframework  for  SME  development,  one  that  can  formulate  and  implement  a  coordinated \ndevelopment strategy for the sector. While a diverse range of government policies and plans \nreferred to the importance of SME development before the SDPL, the Government had yet to \nintegrate them into a national SME development strategy. The process has been constrained by \nlimited institutional resources and capacity, lack of a coordination mechanism, insufficient efforts \nto promote public-private partnerships, and a weak statistical base on SMEs.  \n \na.  Formulation of a Coordinated Plan for SME Development \n32.  ASMED was created under Decree 90. Its tasks and responsibilities are wide-ranging \nand include formulation of an SME development strategy. Under TA 4031,18 ADB provided \ntechnical inputs into the preparation of the roadmap for SME development. The road map, \ntogether with a modernized information system, forms the basis for the SME development \nstrategy. To put the strategy into action, the Minister of Planning and Investment (as chairman \nof the SME Promotion Council) has issued a decision authorizing ASMED to draft a long-term, \nmultisectoral and interministerial SME Development Action Plan. The SME Development Action \nPlan 2006\u20132010, prepared with SDPL support and in coordination with UNIDO, was submitted \nto the Minister of Planning and Investment in January 2006, per Subprogram I Condition (2-3). \nOverall, the strategy aims to facilitate more coordinated approaches to the implementation of \nSME development policy among various government agencies. It also aims to support more \neffective donor coordination.   \n \n33.  The SME Promotion Council was created under Decree 90 to advise the Prime Minister \non mechanisms and policies on SME development. It will play an integral role in monitoring \nimplementation  of  the  SME  Development  Action  Plan.  The  SME  Promotion  Council  has \nmembers from various ministries, yet it has limited membership from the private sector. To \nensure that the evolving concerns of SMEs are more consistently addressed by government \npolicies, the Minister of Planning and Investment issued Decision 649/BKH on 12 July 2005 to \nconfirm  that  representatives  of  other  organizations  will  have  the  same  rights  as  standing \nmembers.  \n \nb.  Development of a System for Collecting Information on SMEs \n34.  Accurate, up-to-date information enables the Government to identify constraints to the \nestablishment  and  growth  of  businesses.  Thus,  targeted  interventions  to  eliminate  such \nconstraints  may  be  initiated  with  predefined  and  quantified  baselines  for  measuring  policy \nimpact. Data on the SME sector in Viet Nam, as defined by Decree 90 (and further segmented \nby number of employees), are not systematically collected. The two main sources of business \ndata\u2014General Statistics Office (GSO) and NBIN\u2014have not yet been formally mandated with \nthis task.  \n \n35.  The new national business registry (\u201cNBIN\u201d is used as a generic term to refer to this \nregistry) will cover all provinces in Viet Nam and will be linked to the online SME portal that was \nlaunched in July 2006. The portal was developed by MPI, per Subprogram I Condition (2-4), \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2002.

It serves as a gateway to information on regulations and procedures \nfor  compliance,  Government  support  programs,  business  associations,  and  other  business \nsupport  providers.  Closer  collaboration  with  GSO  will  also  be  important  in  order  to \nsystematically gather SME indicators, which can then also be linked to the SME portal.  \n \n3.  Enhanced  Mechanisms  for  Improving  SMEs\u2019  Access  to  Financial  and \nPhysical Resources \n36.  Access to finance is perhaps the most often cited inhibitor of SME growth. Under the \ncurrent  operational  environment,  banks  are  becoming  increasingly  interested  in  lending  to \nprivate sector SMEs. However, high transaction costs associated with lending to SMEs have \nheld  back  actual  growth  in  SME  loans.  Availability  of  collateral,  which  can  potentially \ncompensate for SMEs' perceived high credit risk, is limited, given the SMEs\u2019 weak asset base. \nThe  SDPL  supports  measures  to  reduce  the  cost  and  risks  of  lending  by  addressing  the \nbottlenecks  SMEs  face  in  providing  financial  information  and  offering  collateral  to  lenders. \nFurthermore, it is also developing an alternative channel for SME financing through new funding \nsources and a diversified range of products for the leasing industry. \n \na.  Development of an SME Accounting System \n37.  The accounting system for SMEs in Viet Nam has been under development since 1996, \nwith the issuance of Decision 1177, which was later amended by Decision 144 on 21 December \n2001. Both decisions imposed accounting standards for SMEs that were similar to those for \nlarger enterprises. There are currently 25 accounting books applicable to all types of enterprises \nand 39 supporting documents (compulsory and guiding) in accordance with Decisions 1177 and \n144. \n \n38.  On 17 June 2003, the National Assembly passed the Law on Accounting, considerably \nmodernizing the accounting rules in Viet Nam. SME accounting, however, has failed to keep up. \nThe new Accounting Law, which became effective on 1 January 2004, supersedes Decisions \n1177 and 144, but replacement decisions have yet to be issued. The Vietnamese accounting \nstandards are being revamped to conform with the IAS, and a new general accounting system \nwas adopted on 20 March 2006, with MOF Decision 15/2006/QD-BTC. \n \n39.  Despite these significant developments, the accounting and financial reporting policies \nand  procedures  for  SMEs  remain  too  complicated  and  burdensome.  Staff  with  limited \naccounting skills cannot comply with all the requirements. The existing SME accounting system \ndoes not support the management information needs of the SMEs, and it does not provide \nadequate  information  for  prospective  creditors  and/or  lenders.  The  SDPL  has  therefore \nsupported MOF in developing a simplified SME accounting framework, including the chart of \naccounts,  financial  statements,  accounting  books,  and  voucher  system.  Per  Subprogram  I \nCondition (2-5), MOF has issued an SME accounting system, consistent with the IAS and \naccounting legal framework of Viet Nam. The SDPL-Subprogram II will continue to support the \nMOF with assistance to complete and disseminate the new SME accounting system.19  \n \n                                                 \n19  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  operations  have  been  supporting  the  accounting  industry  development.  \nParticularly, with the MOF, ADB has been developing a road map for the industry to adopt the IAS. The \nVietnamese  Accounting  Association,  formed  with  ADB  support,  has  been  operating  as  a  self-regulatory \norganization.   ", "  11\n \n \nb.  Improved Legal Framework for Effective Use of Collateral \ni.  Land Use Rights Certificates \n40.  Bank credit to SMEs in Viet Nam typically requires high levels of collateral, as SMEs \nrarely have adequate financial records or business plans to mitigate credit risk, and few banks \nhave the skills to effectively assess those risks. Given the weak asset base of most SMEs, their \nland use rights are often the only assets that they can collateralize. Yet issuance of LURCs to \nSMEs has been extremely time-consuming, with a series of checks that must be cleared and \nrequirements for legal documents that vary from province to province. To collateralize the land \nuse rights, SMEs have to be equipped with the relevant LURCs, so that they can show their \nlegitimate ownership upon such lands. The situation is further complicated by the lack of a \nsingle LURC for buildings and/or assets attached to land. \n \n41.  According to the Land Law of 2003 and its implementing decrees and circulars, the local \nPeople\u2019s Committee shall be responsible for final issuance of LURCs. The People\u2019s Committee \napproves, signs, and seals the LURC before issuance by the land title offices (LTOs), which is \nlimited to a purely administrative role. The implementation of the Land Law and its supporting \ndecrees, especially the uniform procedures for issuance of the LURCs, has proven difficult. This \nis essentially due to (i) conflicting and/or ambiguous provisions of existing legislation regarding \npolicies and procedures, (ii) the level of bureaucracy involved at local agency level, and (iii) the \nhigh cost of LURC issuance. Compounding these problems is the lack of a national land policy \nand registry system with clear operating guidelines for local LTOs. \n \n42.  The SDPL-Subprogram I has been addressing these shortcomings through technical \nassistance to clarify the legal framework and develop workable models for LURC issuance and \nregistration at the provincial level, where all LURCs for SMEs are processed. Specific inputs \nhave included identification of the problems within the current operational model and legislative \nframework,20 including conflicting articles within the relevant decrees and circulars. Subprogram \nI (per Condition 2-11) has provided support to MONRE in revising Decision 2421 (format and \ncontent of LURCs) and Circular 29 (cadastral records management, including process for LURC \nregistration).  \n \n43.  Subprogram I (per Condition 2-7) has supported the development of uniform procedures \nto be followed by all provincial and district offices of MONRE for (i) land registration and LURC \nissuance,  and  (ii)  information  collection  on  the  issued  LURCs.  Pilot  exercises  have  been \nconducted in three provincial LTOs in Ha Nam, Thai Binh and Bac Ninh to develop new \nstandardized  registration  processes  and  information-sharing  arrangements.  Registration \nprocesses emphasized transparency, simplification, uniformity, standardization, and compliance \nwithin the current legal framework. Electronic links were orchestrated between the LTOs and \ntwo  other  principle  stakeholders  in  the  land  administration  framework  (the  departments  of \nnatural resources and environment, and the provincial People\u2019s Committee), so that data on \nland use, ownership, and subdivision changes could be shared. The pilots were conducted from \nOctober 2005 to January 2006. Subprogram II will further assist MONRE in summarizing and \ndisseminating  the  lessons  learned  from  the  three  pilots  so  that  the  national  rollout  plan \nincorporates the improved uniform procedures within the land registration system.   \n                                                 \n20 This framework consists of Decree 181/2004 (procedures for LURC issuance), Circular 29/2004 (compilation and \nadjustment of cadastral records), Decision 24/2004\u2013Article 2 (format and content of LURCs), and Interminsterial \nCircular 01/2005 (standardized system of registration).  \n21  Incorporating the lessons learned from the pilot LTOs (per Condition 2-7), Decision 24 has been revised and the \nnew Decision 8/2006/QD-BTNMT was issued by MONRE on 21 July 2006.  ", "12   \n \n \n \n44.  Lastly, Subprogram I (per Condition 2-6) has also supported the implementation of new \nguidelines for land valuation for use by local authorities (Decree 188/2004/ND-CP and Circular \n114/2004/TT-BTC). Market-based land valuation is a key innovation of the new Land Law, as \nland  has  traditionally  been  priced  by  People's  Committees  for  purposes  of  taxation  and \ncompensation.22 While the legislative framework is now in place, implementation has proved \ndifficult as (i) market transactions to realize the market prices are not effectively recorded, (ii) \nthe private sector\u2019s role in price valuations remains underdeveloped, and (iii) an estimated 50% \nof land transactions continue to be conducted informally, as a way of avoiding taxes and other \nadministrative burdens. ADB supported MONRE to conduct three field surveys to measure the \nextent  of  compliance  with  Decree  188,  and  developed  recommendations  to  facilitate \nimplementation of its core principles.  \n \nii.  Movable Property \n45.  To  facilitate  SME  use  of  movable  properties  (e.g.,  equipment,  inventories,  and \nreceivables)  as  collateral,  emphasis  has  been  placed  on  the  development  of  a  secured \ntransactions registration system. Under the First Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL I),23 the \nGovernment issued a Secured Transactions Decree (Decree 165) in 1999 and a Decree on \nEstablishing the Registry for Secured Transactions (Decree 08) in 2000.24 These decrees \nprovided the legal foundation for sole responsibility of MOJ for establishing, administering and \nmaintaining a national database for all types of secured transactions on moveable goods.  \n \n46.  To develop a nationwide computerized secured transactions registration system, the \nMinistry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  established  the  National  Registration  Agency  for  Secured \nTransactions (NRAST) in 2002. For the proper functioning of the secured transactions registry, \nlegal documents must clearly establish prioritization of creditors' and lien holders' rights upon \nregistering their interest. Furthermore, the computerized system must ensure efficiency and \ntransparency for potential creditors or purchasers.  \n \n47.  Viet Nam\u2019s amended Civil Code, which became effective in January 2006, abolishes the \ndistinction between pledges and mortgages on the basis of whether the security assets are \nmoveable or immoveable. Instead, pledges and mortgages will be distinguished by who holds \nthe security assets\u2014a transaction will be a pledge when the secured party holds the security \nassets and it will be a mortgage when the securing party keeps the security assets. With this \nconceptual change, there is a need to make an amendment of Decree 165 and Decree 08. Thus, \nthe Government, with support from ADB (and per Subprogram I Condition 2-10), has prepared a \ndraft  implementing  decree  for  the  prioritization  of  creditors'  and  lien  holders'  rights  upon \nregistering their interest on the NRAST.25 The decree addresses the formalities of creating \n                                                 \n22 Under the 2003 Land Law, the MOF (Land Price Division of the Price Control Department) has legislative \nresponsibility for land valuation, but land prices are to be determined in three ways: (i) by city/provincial authorities, \n(ii) in auctions, and (iii) by land users in market transfers and leases. \n23  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Financial Sector Program. Manila \n(approved for $90 million on 19 November 1996).  \n24  Decree 08/2000/ND-CP establishes a single registration regime for secured transactions with a centralized general \nregistry for moveable property and four complementary specialized registries for security in seagoing vessels, \naircraft, LURs, and immoveable property. \n25 ADB will also provide assistance to MOJ on the technical requirements for the functionality of an Internet-based \nsecured  transaction  registry.  Overall,  Viet  Nam  amended  the  Civil  Code  whereby  the  priority  orders  upon \nregistrations of secured transactions are clarified. The implementation decree for the Civil Code\u2019s provisions ", "  13\n \n \nsecurity, priority rules that flow from registration, and the enforcement rights of secured creditors \nupon default. \n \n48.  The  procedures  for  secured  transactions  development  are  proceeding  in  the  right \ndirection. Once the implementing decree on secured transactions is issued, establishing the \nprioritization  system  between  types  of  instruments,  the  main  emphasis  should  be  on \nimplementation,  including  enhancing  the  electronic  capacity  and  sophistication  of  the \nregistration system, and completing the legal framework to enable electronic transactions. The \nnew Law on Electronic Transactions, and its yet-to-be issued implementing decree, should \nprovide key supporting guidelines for electronic signatures, submission of documents, payments \nand other modalities. The activities will be supported through Subprogram II.  \n \nc.  Improved Legal Environment for Financial Leasing Companies \n49.  Financial leasing operations in Viet Nam are governed by Decree 16 (May 2001), which \nwas later amended by Decree 65 (June 2005) and Circular No. 8/2001/TT-NHNN (September \n2001) issued by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). The activities of financial leasing companies \n(FLCs)  are  confined  to  (i)  financial  leasing  for  machinery,  equipment,  vehicles,  and  other \nmovable assets; (ii) advising clients on matters relating to financial leasing operations; and (ii) \nother services related to financial leasing. Decree 65 permits sale and leaseback transactions \nand syndicated leasing, but implementing regulations have to be issued. Transactions in foreign \ncurrency are subject to the foreign exchange control regulations of SBV. FLCs are permitted to \nmobilize capital from (i) short-, medium-, and long-term borrowing from credit institutions in Viet \nNam and abroad; (ii) issuance of bonds with a term of more than 1 year (subject to SBV \napproval); and (iii) other means as stipulated in Article 16 of Decree 16. \n \n50.  The development of the leasing industry in Viet Nam is particularly constrained by \nshortcomings in the legal framework that restrict both the activities and the funding mechanisms \nof FLCs. The Government recognizes that the absence of implementing regulations for sale and \nleaseback transactions and syndicated leasing constrains FLCs from offering a fuller product \nrange tailored to market needs. Long-term funding also presents a problem for some FLCs, \nincluding subsidiaries of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) that source all or most of their \nfunds from their respective parent banks. Thus, in general, there is a mismatch in financing in \nFLCs between their borrowing (short-term) and lending (long-term, as leasing transactions). \nLeasing companies have cited difficulties in attracting term loans of more than 1 year at viable \ninterest rates, and relatively few have been successful in issuing medium- or long-term bonds.  \n \n51.  To address these constraints, Subprogram I (per Conditions 2-8 and 2-9) has supported \nthe SBV in the issuance of implementing guidelines for Decree 65, to specify policies and \nprocedures  for  (i)  sale  of  lease  receivables,  (ii)  sale  and  leaseback  transactions,  and  (iii) \nsyndicated leasing.  A pilot program was launched in March 2006 with the following participating \ninstitutions: (i) Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, (ii) Viet Nam International \nLeasing Company, (iii) Asia Commercial Bank, and (iv) Bank for Industrial Development of Viet \nNam. Under the pilot, provisional guidelines26 have been developed by the SBV to allow the \nparticipating  institutions  to  sell  lease  receivables.  As  of  mid-June  2006,  total  transactions \nexecuted under the pilot were valued at VND105 billion. The pilot is deemed critical to identify \n                                                                                                                                                          \nregarding secured transactions was issued to clarify the priority orders among various secured transactions, and \ntransactions similar to secured transactions, including lease transactions. \n26 SBV Official Document No. 2585 ", "14   \n \n \nalternative source of finance for FLCs, and will be further pursued through a leasing industry \nloan by ADB in 2007.  \n \n52.  A key achievement of the pilot exercise to date has been the development of provisional \nguidelines  for  the  sale  of  lease  receivables  within  the  current  legal  framework.  Beyond \nlegislative reform, however, the longer-term expansion of the financial leasing industry will \nrequire a stronger system of lease right enforcement. Current weaknesses in the court system \nmake it difficult for creditors to recover collateral (and leased goods) upon default of lessees. In \nthe absence of reliable enforcement, the risks of lending will remain high, thereby dampening \nthe  expansion  of  all  forms  of  SME  credit.  Accordingly,  Subprogram  II  will  support  the \nGovernment to further refine and improve the necessary legal framework. \n \n4.  Strengthened  Legal  Framework  for  Land  to  Allow  Market-Based \nTransactions  \n53.  Many SME surveys in Viet Nam point to limited access to land as the foremost constraint \nto their growth.27 Issues on SMEs\u2019 access to land revolve around inefficiencies resulting from \ninconsistencies and biases distinct to economies in transition. For example, there is a significant \ndifference in the proportion of land use rights held by SOEs compared with those held by private \nsector SMEs. The economic transformation process has resulted in a large amount of prime \ncommercial  and  industrial  land  being  allocated  to  SOEs.  However,  many  do  not  take  full \nadvantage of the land allocated to them in their industrial or commercial activities. Much land \nallocated to SOEs is left idle with no plans for future use, while the rapidly growing private SMEs \nare suffering from lack of land. Consequently, leasing idle land from SOEs has become the \nmost common method used by private sector SMEs to obtain land, although subletting from \nSOEs is, in most cases, illegal. \n \n54.  The Government is taking proactive measures to clarify the principles of land law and \nmake them consistent for developing a property market in Viet Nam. For example, the new Land \nLaw of 2003, supported under the SDPL, recognized the property market for the first time in Viet \nNam and stipulates that land pricing should be based on real market transfer prices of land use \nrights under normal circumstances. The Land Law also augments and improves the framework \nfor state management of land in terms of (i) land zoning and planning, (ii) transferring the power \nto allocate or lease land and issue LURCs from the Government to the provincial and district \nPeople\u2019s Committees, (iii) establishing the organization (nonprofit public service SOE) to create \nand manage land funds, (iv) establishing a uniform land registration system for undertaking all \nland registration in Viet Nam, (v) making clear the procedures for settling of land disputes, and \n(vi) clarifying the guiding principles for land pricing. \n \n55.  One  of  the  key  achievements  of  the  new  Land  Law  is  making  land  use  rights \ntransferable  with  market-based  pricing  mechanisms.  It  also  introduced  a  single  nationwide \nregistry system, a uniform procedure for issuing LURCs, and measures to improve the use of \nidle land. A simplified and more transparent legislative framework will benefit SMEs by making \nthe law easier to understand, particularly for owners or operators who have no legal background, \nand by generally reducing transaction costs.  \n \n                                                 \n27  Reports and surveys: Institute of Economics. 2001.

As  SMEs  look  to  access  international  markets,  the  requirements  related  to \nstandardization, metrology, information, testing, accreditation and quality assurance help create \na common trading needs, and reduce costs for manufacturing and warehousing. A simpler and \nclearer set of standards are required, since they can also be onerous for SMEs and there can \nbe a trade-offs between quality assurance and market access. The standards can also become \na regulatory burden for SMEs, and thus the SDPL has supported the Government to improve \ntheir legal framework. For governments, standards offer an opportunity for deregulation and \nimproved  governance  as  they  help  to  ease  the  level  of  regulatory  details  to  essential \nrequirements for health protection, safety, and the environment. Standardization is therefore a \nkey part of microeconomic infrastructure that is still in the development phase in Viet Nam. The \nSDPL-Subprogram I supported the Government in developing industrial and technical standards \nin conformity with best international practices, which promoted participation of all stakeholders. \n \na.  Enhanced the Legal Framework on Industrial and Technical \nStandards in Conformity with International Best Practices \n57.  Viet Nam\u2019s legal framework on industrial and technical standards is currently being \nupdated to bring it in line with international best practices. In November 2004, this framework \nwas composed of the 1999 Ordinance on Product Quality and its implementing Decree 179 \nProviding for State Management over Goods and Product Quality (per Subprogram I Condition \n2-12). Additional legal texts were required to effectively implement the Ordinance, including \nPrime Ministerial Decision 50/2006 which contains a revised \u201cList of Import and Export Products \nfor which Quality Needs to be Checked by the State in 2000\u201d.  \n \n58.  In September 2005, MOST announced that the 1999 Ordinance on Product Quality is to \nbecome a law to be promulgated in November 2006. The SDPL will continue to support MOST \nin preparing this Law. Similarly, the Ordinance on Technical Standardization has also been \nupgraded to a law, with the National Assembly promulgating the new Law on Standards and \nTechnical Regulations on 29 June 2006 (complying with Subprogram I Condition 2-14). This \nLaw is in line with international practices that specify technical regulations.28 This Law and the \nDecision as noted above comply with Subprogram I Condition (2-13).   \n \nb.  Continued Institutional Reforms  \n59.  The current institutional framework for certification and accreditation requires reform to \nfoster a more competitive environment and allow greater SME participation. The Bureau of \nAccreditation  is  the  only  accreditation  body  in  Viet  Nam.  Because of  capacity  constraints, \nhowever, this Bureau has yet to accredit a single certification body. It would therefore be \nbeneficial to authorize international institutions to accredit certification bodies in Viet Nam. \nAccordingly, under Subprogram II the SDPL will support MOST to draft a decision requiring that \nany certification body operating in Viet Nam must be accredited by either a signatory member of \ninternational/regional accreditation body, or Viet Nam's Board of Accreditation. \n \n60.  The Directorate for Standards and Quality (STAMEQ), as authorized by MOST, had \noriginally been the only institution to certify standardized products, quality assurance systems, \n                                                 \n28 Technical regulations are focused on health, safety, and environmental parameters, while technical standards refer \nto material and performance measures, as outlined in the Vietnamese National Technical Standards (TCVN) ", "16   \n \n \nand  testing  laboratories.  These  functions  have  now  been  transferred  to  technical  service \ninstitutions, yet STAMEQ continues to undertake certification. There is a conflict of interest for \nSTAMEQ to act as an accreditation body and as a service institution providing certification in \ncompetition  with  private  certification  providers.  To  address  this  issue  and  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of private certification providers, the SDPL has been supporting MOST in planning \nthe  separation  of  STAMEQ's  state  administrative  functions  from  its  commercial  activities. \nDecree 115/2005/ND-CP was issued in September 2005, providing the legal basis for the \nseparation of the commercial and administrative functions of STAMEQ, thereby complying with \nSubprogram I Condition (2-16).29  Under Subprogram I of the SDPL, technical assistance was \nprovided  to  complete a  diagnostic  study  of the  functions  and  activities  of  STAMEQ,  as  a \npreparatory step to developing a detailed implementation plan for its legal restructuring.30  \n \nc.  Provision of Information on Both National and International \nStandards  \n61.  The SMEs in Viet Nam currently have limited knowledge of international standards and \nnational standards of other countries. Availability of information about competitors and market \nrequirements related to product quality is also limited. A database of international standards and \nnational  standards  of  other  countries  has  been  developed  by  the  Information  Center  of \nSTAMEQ  and  additional  information  regarding  technical  standards  and  product  quality  is \nprovided by other ministerial departments. However, it is not always immediately apparent to \nSMEs  how  this information  relates  to  their  business,  and  finding simple  answers  to  basic \nquestions is often difficult for SMEs that have little knowledge of how standards and conformity \nassessment systems work. SMEs also have limited access to information on testing services \nprovided by Vietnamese and international testing laboratories.  \n \n62.  Lack of access to information and knowledge on standards can be a major competitive \ndisadvantage for SMEs attempting to enter domestic or international markets. To overcome this \nbarrier, and as required per Subprogram I Condition (2-15), MOST has developed an online \ndatabase  providing  SMEs  with  information  on  (i)  international/national  standards  of  other \ncountries,  and  cross-recognition  schemes;  (ii)  certification  bodies,  testing  laboratories,  and \nquality management providers; and (iii) relevant information on technology transfer.   \n \n63.  Operationalization of the database will require continued technical assistance. In the \nmeantime, several websites are providing SMEs with information. Data and links to technical \nstandards of other countries and international standards, e.g., ISO, can be found on the Viet \nNam Standards Center website (www.vsc.org.vn). Summary information on cross-recognition \nschemes  is  available  on  www.tcvn.gov.vn.  The  STAMEQ\u2019s  Viet  Nam  Productivity  Centre \nwebsite  (www.vpc.org.vn)  has  a  list  of  certification  bodies  in  Viet  Nam.  A  list  of  testing \nlaboratories in Viet Nam is available on the Bureau of Accreditation website (www.boa.gov.vn). \nIn  addition,  some  information  on  quailty  management  providers,  particularly  QUACERT \n(www.quacert.gov.vn),  is  provided  on  www.tcvninfo.org.vn.  The  information  on  technology \ntransfer, and the legal framework on intellectual property rights, is provided on the website of \nthe National Office of Intellectual Property of Viet Nam (www.noip.gov.vn).  \n \n                                                 \n29  Circular 12 was issued in June 2006 as an implementing guideline to Decree 115.  \n30  Additional technical assistance (via an AFD TA) will now be provided to STAMEQ to develop this implementation \nplan during the Subprogram II implementation.

To facilitate performance monitoring, baseline data were collected for subsectors with \nquantitative indicators (see Table 2).  \n  \nTable 2: Performance Monitoring Baseline Data \nPerformance Data  2003  2004  2005 \nNumber of newly registered enterprises  27,751  36,795  39,951 \nTotal registered capital of private enterprises (D billions)  57,965  75,125  107,297 \nPrivate sector share in employment    31.8%  33.5%  \u2014 \nPrivate sector share in total domestic bank credit  30%  39%  40% \nAnnual growth of bank credit to SMEs  37%  20%  22% \nPrivate sector share in gross investment   30%  32%  33% \nNumber of days required to start a business  63  56  50 \nNumber of days required to register property  \u2014  78  67 \nValue of lease receivable sale transactions (first 6 months of 2006) \u2014  \u2014  D105 billion \nAverage number of transactions registered at NRAST per month  \u2014  \u2014  1,800 \nAverage number of NRAST discharges per year  \u2014  \u2014  500 \nNumber of enterprises with ISO 9001-2000 certification  1,237  1,598  1,682 \nNumber of enterprises awarded National Quality Award  81  96  132 \nNumber of legally protected business closures  \u2014  \u2014  About 100 \nSources: Ministry of Finance, State Bank of Viet Nam, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Planning and Investment, \nGeneral Statistics Office, Ministry of Science and Technology, World Bank Doing Business Database. \n \n65.  During SDPL-Subprogram I implementation, Viet Nam\u2019s private sector has continued its \nexpansion. More and more enterprises are registered every year (43% more in 2005 than in \n2003), and greater access to finance (private sector share of bank credit grew from 30% in 2003 \nto 40% in 2005) has led to faster capital accumulation. The private sector accounted for 33% of \ntotal gross investment in 2005, up from 30% in 2003.   \n \n66.  The net effect of reforms in business registration, licensing, and land registration are \nalso apparent, with the total number of days required to start a company falling from 63 days in \n2003 to 50 days in 2005, and the total number of days required to register property falling from \n78 days in 2004 to 67 days in 2005. These trends are expected to continue with continued \nsupport from SDPL-Subprogram II.  \n \n67.  Activity at NRAST has been growing steadily since its creation in 2002, with an average \nof 1,800 secured transactions registered per month in 2005. Similarly, the implementation of \nSBV\u2019s pilot program for the sale of lease receivables has resulted in VND105 billion worth of \ntransactions in the first 3 months of the pilot (April\u2013June 2006). The private sector share of total \ndomestic bank credit grew from 30% in 2003 to 40% in 2005. Simplified processes for LURC \nissuance and secured transactions have expanded the use of collateral, further supporting this \ntrend. According to the SBV, the annual growth rate of banking credit to SMEs rose to an \nestimated 22% in 2005, up from 20% in 2004.  \n \n68.  Reforms to improve the quality management and certification process under the SDPL \nare critical to facilitating SME access to international markets. A host of legislative changes \nsupported by the SDPL have helped to pave the way for a simpler product quality and standards \nmanagement. The number of firms receiving ISO 9001-2000 certification increased from 1,598 \nin 2004 to 1,682 in 2005. Similarly, the number of firms receiving the National Quality Award \nincreased from 96 in 2004 to 132 in 2005.  ", "18   \n \n \n \nC.  Conclusion on Implementation of Subprogram I \n69.  Overall, based on the data as illustrated above, Viet Nam\u2019s SME sector has shown the \nmost  rapid  growth  among  the  neighboring  countries  in  the  Mekong  region.  Further,  the \nimprovements in the regulatory environment, as assessed through the World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness 2006 Survey, indicate that Viet Nam is one of the top performers in the Asian region.   \n \n70.  While many challenges remain, the implementing agencies' commitment to complete \nSDPL-Subprogram I under Loan No. 2095-VIE (SF) was visible in the steady progress made \ntoward  completing  all  policy  actions  throughout  implementation.  The  completion  of  the \nconditions that were geared on improving the regulatory environment are indicative of the \nimprovements that have been made.  Accordingly, the Government has complied with all 16 \nconditions  of  the  second  tranche.  The  quality  of  outputs  under  Subprogram  I  has  been \nsatisfactory. The capacity to implement reforms varied, however, and periodic shortages of \nqualified staff caused delays in the reform agenda. Capacity of implementing agencies is being \ndeveloped under TA-4418 and the TAs of KfW and AFD. The Government is committed to \ncontinuing the reform program, and is ready to proceed with SDPL-Subprogram II. In view of the \nsignificant progress made in the implementation of the overall Program and the full compliance \nwith the second tranche conditions, release of the second tranche of the SDPL-Subprogram I is \njustified. \n \nVI.  SDPL-SUBPROGRAM II\u2014PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope  \n71.  The objective of SDPL-Subprogram II is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to create a \nbusiness  environment  that  is  conducive  to  economic  growth  and  employment  generation. \nSpecifically, Subprogram II will continue to support reform measures for (i) enhancing the policy \nand regulatory framework, (ii) improving SMEs\u2019 access to finance and land use rights, and (iii) \nfacilitating SMEs\u2019 access to markets by improving industrial and technical standards. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n72.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  reform  by  taking  advanced \nactions in a number of key areas, including three conditions on which progress must be made \nfor ADB Board consideration of Subprogram II (3-1, 3-9, and 3-11). The refined policy matrix is \nprovided in Appendix 3, while the details on the refinements in regards to Subprogram II are \nfurther explained in Appendix 9.31 The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n1.  Improving the Current Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n73.   Two implementing decrees to the NEL are in the process of being issued to further \ndetail the Government\u2019s new policies for business licensing and registration. Subprogram II \nCondition (3-1) requires the Government to assign the Task-Force on Enterprise Law and \nInvestment Law Enforcement to undertake a regulatory review existing as well as proposed new \nlicenses, as stated in Articles 7 and 172 of the Enterprise Law, including: (a) publication of all \neffective licenses, and (b) stakeholder-initiated regulatory reviews.  This is to ensure continuous \n                                                 \n31  Accordingly, the Development Policy Letter from the Government is provided in Appendix 5.  ", "  19\n \n \nmonitoring and improvements of the business regulatory systems.  This component is revised to \nreflect the spirit of the New Enterprise Law.  ADB intends to support its implementation as \nrequired.   \n \n74.  Progress towards implementing the NBIN expansion plan in all provinces and some \ndistricts (Subprogram II Condition 3-2) is being made with the drafting of the new implementing \ndecree and circulars for business registration under the new NEL. These legal documents are \ndefining the new registration processes, responsibilities of registration agencies at all levels, \napplication forms, registration certificate formats, data standardization, business classification \ncode, and other information critical to the rollout of a national business registration system \nnationwide. While the Government had already developed a plan for NBIN expansion under \nSubprogram I of the SDPL, the promulgation of the NEL has required a review and adjustment \nof  this  plan.  The  plan\u2019s  revision,  approval,  and  implementation  will  now  be  supported  by \nSubprogram II Condition (3-3). \n \n2.  Establishing the Government\u2019s Policy and Institutional Framework for SME \nDevelopment \n75.   Subprogram II loan conditions are focused on securing Prime Ministerial approval for \nthe SME Development Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010 (Condition 3-4), publication of an annual \nState of the SME Sector report (Condition 3-5), and operationalization of an SME information \nwebsite (Condition 3-6). Substantial progress has been made in all three of these areas. \n \n(3-4)   The SME development action plan (\u201cSME Development Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010\u201d), \nprepared with SDPL support, was submitted to the Minister of Planning and Investment \nin  January  2006.  The  action  plan  is  finalized  with  the  integration  of  interministerial \ncomments and was submitted to the Prime Minister for approval.  \n \n(3-5)   The State of the SME Sector report, which is to be issued annually to monitor the \nimplementation  progress  of  the  SME  Development  Five-Year  Plan,  will  require \nquantitative indicators on SMEs that are not currently being collected. ASMED, with \nsupport from UNIDO and ADB, has (i) identified the data requirements for the report, (ii) \nidentified the source of the data, and (iii) defined the report template. It is expected that \nGSO and NBIN will provide critical data inputs to the report. \n \n(3-6)  The ASMED\u2019s new online SME portal was launched in July 2006. The website has \ninformation on markets, regulations, and other topics of interest to SMEs.   \n \n3.  Enhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n76.  The  Government  has  made  good  progress  towards  completing  five  of  the  seven \nSubprogram  II  policy  actions  designed  to  enhance  SME  access  to  financial  and  physical \nresources. In the area of accounting development, there are three Subprogram II conditions. \n \n(3-7)  The  MOF  is  required  to  issue  a  decision  on  a  SME  accounting  system  based  on \nVietnamese and International Accounting Standards, which includes a simplified chart of \naccounts. \n \n(3-8)  The MOF is required to issue user-guidelines with instructions on: (i) simplified chart of \naccounts; (ii) system of accounting books; and (iii) formats for the financial reporting \nrequirements. ", "20   \n \n \n \n(3-9)  The MOF and the Vietnamese Accounting Association are to conduct training programs \n(including production of training manuals) to train the SMEs and business associations. \n \nIt is expected that Conditions (3-7) and (3-8) will be met with the issuance of the MOF decision \non the new SME accounting system in 2006, as this system will include (i) simplified chart of \naccounts;  (ii)  system  of  accounting  books;  and  (iii)  formats  for  the  financial  reporting \nrequirements, all of which have already been developed as part of the draft SME accounting \nframework. With the expected adoption of the new SME accounting system, the Government \nintends  to  implement  an  extensive  training  program  for  SMEs  (with  support  from  ADB) \nthroughout 2007, thereby meeting Condition (3-9). \n \n77.  Subprogram II Condition (3-10) requires MONRE to prepare a plan for the national \nrollout  of  the  uniform  land  registration  system.  Progress  towards  meeting  this  condition  is \nrequired for Board consideration of loan processing of Subprogram II. Satisfactory progress has \nbeen made, with an initial plan developed by MONRE in October 2005, which is now being \nrefined with technical assistance from the World Bank. The plan will cover all major land \nadministration functions handled at the provincial level, including registration, and it is expected \nto begin implementation in 2008.  \n \n78.  Under Subprogram II Condition (3-11), the Government is to leverage the results of the \npilot program to allow the expansion of sale of lease receivables to any institution, and if \nnecessary, to amend the legal framework to allow this activity. Provisional guidelines for the \nsale of lease receivables (SBV Official Document No. 2585), developed for the pilot, state that \nany institution or individual may purchase lease receivables.32 Resale of the lease receivables is \nalso permitted, in which case the rights of the subsequent purchaser must be governed by any \nlimitations set out in the primary sale agreement. Compliance with this Subprogram II condition \ncan be met by formalizing the provisional guidelines for the sale of lease receivables. \n \n79.  Subprogram II Condition (3-12) calls for the MOJ to submit to the Government a draft \nimplementing decree to the ordinance on registration of secured transactions which permits \nanyone to obtain free non-certified reports through an Internet-based search of NRAST records.  \nIt should be noted that NRAST functions today as a paper-based registry, and as such already \nshares reports through an automated facsimile process. To enable the electronic functions, \nlegislative reforms and information technology upgrades will be required, as per Subprogram II \nCondition (3-13). A critical first step in this direction will be the issuance of an implementing \ndecree for prioritization of creditors' and lien holders' rights upon registering their interest with \nNRAST, as per policy Condition (2-10). The MOJ, with support from ADB, has submitted the \ndraft decree to the Government in October 2006. \n \n4.  Enhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to International Markets \n80.  To support SME access to international markets, Subprogram II has three policy actions \nrelated to the legal framework for technical standards and certification (Conditions 3-14, 3-15, \nand 3-16), one policy action related to institutional reform at STAMEQ (Condition 3-17), and \nanother  related  to  SME  participation  in  standards  development  (Condition  3-18).  These \n                                                 \n32  Much of the legal and regulatory framework for leasing is being undertaken by the Viet Nam: Second Financial \nSector Program Loan Cluster (ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors \non a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Financial Sector Program Loan Cluster. \nManila),  approved  in  2003.  The  cluster  supports  the  issuance  of  various  legal  documents  and  regulatory \nguidelines.  ", "  21\n \n \nmeasures attempt to complete the reform agenda, consistent with WTO requirements, to make \nthe legal and institutional framework more transparent and accessible to the public. Overall, \nthese efforts ensure that the technical standards legal framework supports the enterprises\u2019 \naccess to markets, and is not used as a barrier for both imports and exports.   \n \nC.  Important Features: Refined Actions for Subprogram II  \n81.  Five policy actions have been amended and two more added to reflect the changing \npace  and  context  of  the  reforms  under  the  SDPL.  In  the  area  of  business  licensing  and \nregistration, proposed revisions comprise (i) amending one policy action (3-1) proposing a \nsystem for business licenses that establishes a stronger institutional framework for effective \nlicensing reform, (ii) amending one policy action (3-2) calling for the completion of the NBIN \nexpansion plan to one that recognizes the recent promulgation of the NEL and its impact on \nfuture NBIN functionalities, and (iii) adding a policy action (3-3) to leverage the new NBIN to \nfurther simplify the business application process.  \n \n82.  To further enhance SMEs\u2019 access to financial and physical resources, one policy action \n(3-13) related to operationalizing the electronic functionalities of the NRAST was reworded to \nmake the scope of needed changes more  explicit.  \n \n83.  To further support SME access to international markets, (i) one policy action (3-15) was \nadded to support the implementation of the Law on Product Quality; and (ii) a second policy \naction  (3-17)  was  amended  to  allow  more  resources  to  be  allocated  to  the  detailed \nimplementation plan for the legal separation of STAMEQ.  \n \n1.  Improving the Current Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n84.  As  noted  above,  Subprogram  II  Condition  (3-1)  stipulates  that  the  Task-Force  on \nEnterprise Law and Investment Law Enforcement is assigned by the Government to undertake \na regulatory review existing as well as proposed new licenses, as stated in the Enterprise Law, \nincluding: (a) publication of all effective licenses, and (b) stakeholder-initiated regulatory reviews.  \nThis is expected to result in continuous monitoring and improvements of the business regulatory \nsystems.  This component is revised to reflect the spirit of the New Enterprise Law.  ADB \nintends to support its implementation as required.   \n \n85.  On business registration, with the promulgation of the NEL, the MPI now has the legal \nbasis to expand NBIN and its national business names database (per Condition 3-2). The SDPL \nwill continue to support ASMED with technical assistance for the implementation phase of this \nwork, in line with the new prescriptions of the draft implementing decree and circulars and in \nclose collaboration with other ongoing donor programs, most notably UNIDO.  \n \n86.  While the new national business registry system will be an essential management tool \nfor ASMED, and will provide valuable statistical information for MPI and GSO, it is also meant to \nserve the business community by facilitating and enhancing the transparency of procedures for \nlegal compliance. This can be done by allowing a convergence of registration and tax codes, so \nas to eliminate the need for companies to register with both the Business Registration Office \nand tax authority, and to facilitate selected data sharing between the registry system and the tax \nauthorities. \n \n87.  Prime Ministerial Instruction 1842/VPCP-CCHC dated 7 April 2006 is an initial step in \nthis direction. It requires the MPI, MOF, and Ministry of Public Security to issue an inter-", "22   \n \n \nministerial circular describing new procedure for combining the issuance of business registration \ncertificates, tax codes, and business seals in a single, \u201cone stop shop\u201d process. Ultimately, \nbusinesses should be able to download a single, standard business start-up application form \nfrom the Internet (or retrieve it from their provincial registration offices), which would combine \nthe information requirements of the MPI, MOF, and Ministry of Public Security. In this way the \nbusiness would only need to submit one form, at one time, to complete its basic business \napplication process.33 To support these initiatives, Condition (3-3) has been added to develop \nand implement the new simplified application process in all provinces. \n \n2.  Enhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n88.  Condition 3-13 of Subprogram II requires the MOJ to establish NRAST in accordance \nwith the ordinance and implementing decree referenced in condition 3-11, i.e., in such a way as \nto  fully  enable  its  online  functionalities.  Technical  conversion  to  an  electronic,  web-based \nsystem  (required  for  compliance  with  the  condition)  will  require  enhancing  the  electronic \ncapacity and sophistication of the registration system, and completing the legal framework to \nenable electronic transactions. Types of legislation to be considered will include e-commerce, \nwhich  would  have  provisions  for  the  acceptance  of  electronic  signatures,  documents,  and \npayments.34 To capture the scope of the required reforms and provide further support to MOJ \nunder the SDPL, policy Condition (3-12) has been amended to include:  \n \n(i)  the issuing of an implementing legal normative document(s) that enable(s) an  \ne-Government service delivery model to be operated by NRAST for the purposes \nof secured transactions; and \n \n(ii)  the development of a project implementation plan for NRAST that includes: (a) a \ndetailed budget for the development of an online secured transaction registration \nsystem, (b) planned activities to increase public awareness, (c) capacity-building \nactivities for the system operators, and (d) a detailed project roll-out schedule.  \n \n89.  Finally,  while  there  are  no  specific  changes  to  the  policy  conditions,  the  SDPL-\nSubprogram II will continue to support the SMEs\u2019 access to finance via improving the legal \nframework on leasing as well as training the SMEs on the SME accounting system.  \n \n3.  Enhancing SMEs\u2019 Access to International Markets \n90.  To further enhance the legal framework for product quality, the Government plans to \npromulgate a Law on Product Quality by the mid-2007. As part of its ongoing support of these \nreforms, the SDPL proposes to include the issuance of the implementing decree to this Law as \na  new  policy  action  (3-15)  under  Subprogram  II.    ADB  will  support  this  efforts  based  on \ncoordination with other donor agencies.  \n \n91.  Condition (3-17) calls for the Government to approve and implement the plan for the \nSTAMEQ\u2019s separation of commercial and state administrative activities. With the issuance of \nDecree  115/2005/ND-CP  in  September  2005,  the  legal  basis  for  the  separation  of  the \ncommercial  and  administrative  activities  of  MOST  has  been  established,  but  detailed \n                                                 \n33 In this regard the electronic registration already available in Ho Chi Minh City is noteworthy, but it does not yet \ncombine the tax code and seal application requirements. \n34 The new Law on Electronic Transactions and its future implementing regulations are expected to guide electronic \nsignatures, submission of documents, and acceptance of payments. ", "  23\n \n \nimplementation  planning  has  not  been  completed.  In  addition,  Circular  No.12/2006/TTLT/ \nBKHCN-BTC-BNV (June 2006) was issued to guide the implementation of Decree 115, on the \nautonomy and self-responsibility mechanism applicable to public scientific and technological \ninstitutions. An AFD-funded TA, scheduled to begin by December 2006, will support STAMEQ in \nthis  effort.  The  implementation  plan  will  include  all  legal,  financial,  and  organizational \narrangements to complete the separation by the target date of 2009. Approval of the plan will be \nvia  a  prime  ministerial  decision  replacing  Decision  140 on  the  functionalities  of  STAMEQ. \nSTAMEQ expects that this process could take more than 18 months, so that approval of the \nplan before June 2008 (end date of the SDPL) is unlikely. Because an intermediary step in the \napproval  process,  such  as  submission  of  the  detailed  plan  to  the  Government,  can  be \ncompleted within the timeframe of the SDPL, the condition has been reworded accordingly.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n92.  The lending modality of the SDPL is a program cluster, comprising two back-to-back \nsubprograms.  For  Subprogram  I,  an  ADB  loan  of  $60  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) has been approved. For the succeeding Subprogram II\u2014based on \nresource availability and satisfactory performance of Subprogram I\u2014an ADB loan of $20 million \nequivalent from ADF is proposed. Further, the SDPL is being cofinanced by AFD and KfW. AFD \nis  providing  cofinancing  of  \u20ac35  million\u2014\u20ac22  million  for  Subprogram  I  and  \u20ac13  million  for \nSubprogram II. KfW has proposed cofinancing of \u20ac20 million\u2014\u20ac14 million for Subprogram I and \n\u20ac6 million for Subprogram II. \n \n93.  The total amount for the SDPL and loan amounts for the subprograms are determined \non the basis of the strategic importance of developing the SME sector and the costs of structural \nreforms to be supported under the SDPL. Such costs arising from reform measures to be \nimplemented are estimated to be around $190 million to $250 million equivalent during the 36 \nmonths of program implementation.35 It has been estimated that streamlined licensing, and \nbusiness and land registration procedures will reduce fees in the range of $35 million to $55 \nmillion per year. Equipment, software, and hardware for establishing systems in support of a \nstreamlined and efficient business and land registration systems in the pilot phase will incur \ncosts of approximately $20 million. Training, including for those at local and district levels, is \nestimated to cost $12 million per year. Institutional reform measures, including those for the \nAgency for SME Development, Business and Land Registration Section at the district level, and \nSTAMEQ, are estimated to cost about $28 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n94.  MPI will be the Executing Agency for the SDPL. MONRE, MOF, MOST, MOJ, and SBV \nwill be the implementing agencies. MPI will be responsible for overall program implementation, \nincluding  administration  and  preparation  of  semiannual  progress  reports  on  program \nimplementation.  \n \n95.  To  coordinate  program  implementation  among  government  ministries  and  agencies \nconcerned, a program steering committee (PSC) was established for Subprogram I and will be \nmaintained for Subprogram II. The PSC, chaired by a deputy minister of MPI, will comprise \nsenior officers from all ministries and government agencies concerned (MOF, MONRE, MOST, \n                                                 \n35 ADB estimates. ", "24   \n \n \nMOJ, and SBV). The PSC will meet twice yearly and on an ad hoc basis to review pending \nissues  and  propose  concrete  actions  for  their  resolution  to  ensure  timely  program \nimplementation. A program implementation and coordination unit will also be maintained within \nMPI to assist the PSC and ADB in implementing the Program. The unit will be headed by a \nsenior officer of MPI and staffed with MPI officials. The unit will be responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation of the SDPL. \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement \n96.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with standard \npublic procedures in Viet Nam and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to \nADB.36 Goods commonly traded on the international commodity markets will be procured in \naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. 37\n \n97.  The proceeds of the SDPL-Subprogram II will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, \nexcept for a list of ineligible items. The Borrower will certify that the value of total imports minus \n(i) imports from nonmember countries; (ii) ineligible imports; and (iii) disbursements made under \nother official development assistance, is greater than the amount expected to be disbursed \nduring the year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower's certification.  \n \n3.  Counterpart Funds \n98.  The Government has assured that sufficient funds will be made available to meet the \ncosts  associated  with  the  reform  program  supported  by  the  SDPL-Subprogram  II.  Any \ncounterpart funds not required for the reforms will be used for general budget support. \n \n4.  Monitoring and Tranching \n99.  The Government and ADB (along with cofinanciers in AFD and KfW) will continue to \nengage in active policy dialogue on sector issues, policy reforms, and other measures during \nthe SDPL-Subprogram II implementation and on additional reforms that may be considered \nnecessary or desirable.  \n \n100.  For its effective implementation, the program lending modality requires an appropriate \nregime  for  public  financial  management,  including  budget  development,  execution  and \nmonitoring, external fiscal reporting, and transparency. The aid community in Viet Nam has \nmade collective efforts to assess the status of the public financial management system and \nproduced  a  number  of  periodic  diagnostic  reports.  During  the  SDPL-Subprogram  II \nimplementation, ADB will, from time to time, review reports on the public financial management \nsystem in Viet Nam prepared by other aid agencies and will request the Government to clarify \nand discuss issues identified in such reports. Overall, based on the fiduciary framework in place, \nand  the  experience  with  the  Subprogram  I  implementation,  it  seems  that  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements for the SDPL-Subprogram II appear to be sufficient. \n \n                                                 \n36  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n37  The list of ineligible items is in Appendix 7.  ", "  25\n \n \n101.  The Government will submit to ADB consolidated semiannual reports on the SDPL-\nSubprogram II implementation and accomplishment of objectives. The consolidated reports, to \nbe submitted in such form and detail and within the period that ADB may reasonably request, \nwill cover (i) progress made and specific problems encountered during the 6 months under \nreview, (ii) steps taken or proposed to resolve the problems, and (iii) proposed SDPL activities \nand expected progress during the following 6 months. ADB will send regular review missions to \nconfirm compliance with conditions for the release for Subprogram II, and advise on actions to \nmaintain the SDPL-Subprogram II implementation on course. To the extent possible, the review \nmissions will be fielded jointly with AFD and KfW. Within 3 months from completion of the \nSDPL-Subprogram II or at such time as deemed appropriate, the Government will prepare and \nsubmit to ADB a consolidated program completion report on the overall impact of the policy \nreforms implemented.  \n \n102.  Subprogram II. The proposed loan for Subprogram II is processed separately after the \nsuccessful completion of Subprogram I and presented to the Board for approval. Subprogram II \ncomprises a loan of $20 million equivalent from ADF. It is designed as a single-tranche loan. \nThe  current  design  is  consistent  with  the  requirement  that  the  principal  concept  of  Board \nconsideration conditions must be maintained in Subprogram II. The conditions for Subprogram II \nare envisioned to be implemented within 18 months from its effectiveness.38  \n \n103.  Anticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the proposed \nSDPL. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the Loan Agreement. \n \nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impact \n104.  In  resolving  legal,  institutional,  and  technical  constraints  that  place  SMEs  at  a \ndisadvantage  in  accessing  credit,  acquiring  land-use  rights,  and  achieving  regulatory \ncompliance,  the  SDPL-Subprogram  II  takes  a  market-based  participatory  approach.  For \ninstance, the SDPL acknowledges the fundamental role of information for markets to allocate \nresources efficiently and the essential need for all market participants to have access to that \nsame relevant public information. The SDPL-Subprogram II also attempts to utilize current \ntechnology in making as much pertinent information as possible obtainable in the public domain.  \n \n105.  Subprogram II also attempts to further enhance the governance and transparency of the \nGovernment. In conjunction with the PARM, the SDPL includes various components to support \nthe Government\u2019s efforts for reducing corruption. Accordingly, adopting simple and uniform \nsystems and administrative procedures is the basic principle that guides the SDPL-Subprogram \nII.  Simple  and  uniform  systems  and  administrative  procedures  have  the  merit  of  avoiding \nconfusion, arbitrariness, and rent-seeking behavior in delivering public services, particularly at \nthe provincial and district levels. They also bring the benefits of economies of scale when \nimplemented through a nationwide system, thus reducing the total cost of service delivery; and \nthe cost of doing business for enterprises would also be reduced. Specific examples include (i) \n                                                 \n38  Based on loan effectiveness, it is estimated that the tranche release for Subprogram II is expected in June 2008. ", "26   \n \n \nbusiness licensing and registration procedures, (ii) simplified accounting system for SMEs, (iii) \nprocedures for issuance of LURCs, and (iv) uniform standardization systems.  \n \n106.  Accordingly, in sum, the SDPL-Subprogram II has continued the reforms initiated in \nSubprogram I and concentrate on the following: (i) improving key legal and regulatory structure, \n(ii) facilitating greater transparency through improved information flows, (iii) enhancing policy \nstructure through stakeholder consultation and feedback in policy formulation, and (iv) seeking \nbetter governance through private sector participation in regulatory activities of the Government. \nThese positive elements incorporated in the SDPL-Subprogram II will increasingly be felt as the \nexisting systems are transformed and modernized to better support a progressively market-\noriented economy. Successful implementation will form the basis for further developing the \nprivate sector in Viet Nam.  \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n107.  There are four principal risks in implementing the SDPL-Subprogram II. The first involves \nensuring effective coordination and cooperation within the government, both horizontally among \ndifferent  ministries  and  agencies  concerned  and  vertically  with  the  provincial  and  district \nauthorities. Consultation and coordination with the private sector and the aid community active \nin SME development will also be required. It is expected that coordination and cooperation \namong  all  stakeholders  will  gradually  improve  with  the  increased  coordination  capacity  of \nASMED, thus reducing the risk of overlap and inconsistencies in SME support activities. TA in \nsupport of SDPL implementation will also include capacity building for ASMED to reduce this \nrisk. \n \n108.  A second risk pertains to good governance (particularly as related to effective and \ntransparent implementation of the existing policies and laws) in the central, provincial, and \ndistrict governments. Governance at the provincial and district level is particularly important, \nsince the positive impact of the SDPL requires effective implementation of policies at the ground \nlevel. Also important is the need for the Government to allocate sufficient resources and staffs \nfor  policy  implementation.  These  risks  are  common  to  several  programs  and  are  being \naddressed  through  the  implementation  of  the  comprehensive  Public  Administration  Reform \nMaster Program (PARM) for 2001\u20132010, which is being supported by ADB.39\n \n109.  A third risk relates to the technical capacities of implementing agencies. Experience \nsuggests that, given adequate technical support, the Government\u2019s commitment to reforms is \nstrong. In implementing previous programs, delays were caused predominantly by the lack of \ntechnical expertise and of the consensus-building approach in enacting of laws and regulations. \nTo reduce this risk, the TAs from ADB, AFD, and KfW have been formulated and implemented \nthrough discussions with all implementing agencies at the technical level. Many requirements \npertain to completing the legal framework and putting in place modern information technology-\nbased systems, taking into consideration the experience of other countries. The SDPL will also \ninvolve coordination with aid agencies in their respective areas in each component. As ADB has \nbeen serving as a co-chair of the donor coordination committee, this remains an important task.  \n \n                                                 \n39  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \nCluster, Phase I of the Proposed Program Loan and Technical Assistance Grants to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam to Support Implementation of the Public Administration Reform Master Program. Manila (approved for $45 \nmillion on 19 January). ", "  27\n \n \n110.  Finally,  the  final  risk  relates  to  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  implement  the \nnecessary reforms. The SPDL contains the issuance of a number of legal documents.  While a \ngood progress has been made to meet the conditions, this does not necessarily lead to effective \nimplementation of the legal documents.  As noted above, the effective implementation requires \ngood capacity, coordination among key agencies, and political commitment.  For Viet Nam, \nhowever,  such  commitment  seems  to  be  clear\u2014particularly  based  on  the  successful \nSubprogram I implementation. The fact that Viet Nam is accessing to the WTO regime also \nindicates  their  commitment  for  market-based  development.  The  new  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan also emphasizes the importance of SME Development. The Design and \nMonitoring Framework (Appendix 1) has been enhanced to ensure that ADB can effectively \nexamine the implementation progress. \n \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n111.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement of SDPL \nSubprogram II as described in the development policy letter will continue to operate. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  promptly  adopt  the  policies  and  actions  included  in  SDPL \nSubprogram II, and specified in the development policy letter of SDPL, and will ensure \nthat such policies and actions continue to operate. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n112.  As  a  subprogram,  SDPL-Subprogram  I  does  not  have  specific  conditions  for  loan \neffectiveness. The Government has assured that the following loan effectiveness conditions for \nthe SDPL cluster as originally agreed will be maintained: (i) establishment and maintenance of \nthe PSC; and (ii) establishment and maintenance of a program implementation and coordination \nunit, responsible for day-to-day program implementation, headed by a senior officer of MPI \n(ASMED) and staffed with MPI officials. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n113.  The  disbursement  of  the  single  tranche  under  SDPL-Subprogram  II  is  subject  to \nfulfillment of specified tranche release conditions and satisfactory compliance with the overall \nprogram, as set out in the policy matrix in Appendix 3.  \n \nIX.  PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION AND RECOMMENDATION \n114.  In view of the substantial progress made in the implementation of Subprogram I and \nsubstantial compliance with each of the 16 conditions for release of the second tranche of \nSubprogram I, I, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of \nthe Articles of Agreement of ADB, have authorized the release of the second tranche of the \nSDPL-Subprogram I. In accordance with the established procedure, the release of the second \ntranche will be effected not less than 10 working days after the circulation of this report. \n ", "28   \n \n \n115.  I am also satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 13,533,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for Subprogram II of the SDPL, from ADB's special funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n24 years, including a grace

Definition of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)  \n1.  Decree 90 defines small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to be \u201cthose business \nand production establishments that have registered under the current legislation, have the \nregistered capital of less than D10 billion at business registration agencies and/or the average \nnumber of annual permanent employees of less than 300.\u201d Recognizing that this SME grouping \nis  too  general  to  provide  useful  data  for  policy  formulation,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment (MPI) introduced a further size segmentation in its SME Development Plan 2006\u2013\n2010. This new segmentation further breaks out the SME category into microenterprises (fewer \nthan 10 persons), small enterprises (10 to 49 persons) and medium-sized enterprises (50 to 299 \npersons). While data on SMEs are not yet collected according to this segmentation, the formal \nadoption of the SME Development Plan will provide the needed mandate going forward. \n \nB.  Size and Diversity of the SME Sector: 2000\u20132004 \n2.  Although improving, data on the SME sector in Viet Nam are still limited. The main \nsources of data are the national statistical network with data collected by the General Statistics \nOffice  (GSO),  and  the  National  Business  Information  Network  (NBIN)  of  the  MPI.  Some \ntentative conclusions as to the size and diversity of the sector can be drawn, using data \ncollected by these organizations for other purposes.  \n \n3.  Table A2.1 outlines the overall profile of formal enterprises in Viet Nam from 2000 to \n2004. About 165,000 enterprises have been registered under the 1999 Enterprise Law since its \nenactment in 2000. This number does not include the several hundred thousand registered \nhousehold and small enterprises without tax codes, or the several million informal household \nenterprises not obliged to register at local government offices.1\n \nTable A2.1: Number of Firms in Viet Nam, 2000\u20132004 \nType of Firm  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004 \n   SOEs   5,759  5,355  5,364  4,845  4,596 \n   Non-SOEsa 35,004  44,314  55,236  64,526  84,003 \n   FIEs  1,525  2,011  2,308  2,641  3,156 \nTotal  42,288  51,680  62,898  72,012  91,755 \nSOEs (% of total)  13.6  10.4  8.5  6.7  5.1 \nNon-SOEs (% of total)  82.8  85.7  87.8  89.6  91.6 \nFIEs (% of total)  3.6  3.9  3.7  3.7  3.4 \nTotal  100  100  100  100  100 \nPrivate sector share in employment (%)        31.8  33.5 \nPrivate sector share in domestic bank credit (%)        30  39 \nFIE = foreign invested enterprise; SOE = state-owned enterprise.  \na Almost 90% of the registered enterprises are considered as SMEs. \nSource: General Statistics Office. \n \nFurthermore, other indicators that identify the performance of private enterprise in the economy, \nincluding share of employment and share of bank credit, indicate the positive trends in the \ndevelopment of the sector.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Establishments Census conducted by the General Statistics Office in 2003 showed that Viet Nam had more \nthan 2.7 million business establishments engaging over 8.3 million people in 2002. ", "38  Appendix 2 \n4.  In  1998  there  were  592,234  non-tax-coded  enterprises.  The  number  increased  to \n649,284 in 2002, and to an estimated 800,000 in 2004. These enterprises are assumed to be \nsmall in size and scope of operation. As there are no systematic statistical data on these \nenterprises, the analysis will assume that enterprises without tax codes have registered capital \nbelow D10 billion, employ fewer than 300 employees, and hence are also SMEs.  \n \n5.  GSO  data  allow  the  disaggregation  of  only  those  enterprises  with  tax  codes,  as \nillustrated in Table A2.1. The data show that the number of non-SOEs since 2000 has grown \nmore rapidly than SOEs or FIEs, with non-SOEs representing 91.6% of the total number of \nformal registered firms with tax codes. The number of SOEs is observed to have declined from \n6,498 in 1998 to 4,596 enterprises in 2004 due to SOE equitization. \n \n6.  Table A2.2 shows that based on the registered capital criterion, at the end of 2004, there \nwere 79,420 formal enterprises with registered capital below D10 billion.2 SMEs accounted for \n86.6% of total enterprises.

In terms of firm classification by economic activities, Table A2.4 shows that formal SMEs \n(defined as enterprises with fewer than 300 employees) were concentrated mainly in services \nand commerce (60.5% of total SMEs), followed by industry and construction (37% of total).

Data on contributions to gross domestic product (GDP) issued by GSO are not classified \nby  enterprise  size,  but  rather  by  type  of  enterprise  ownership.  However,  since  the  SMEs \nconstitute an overwhelming proportion of enterprises in Viet Nam, their contribution to GDP is \nregarded as significant.3 Though data on the contribution of the SME sector to the national \neconomy are not available, it can be assumed that the SME contribution is largely equivalent to \nthat contributed by the non-state sector. Table A2.5 shows the reported GDP contributions by \nSOEs, non-SOEs, and FIEs. In 2004, the state sector contribution was about 39%; non-SOEs \ncontributed about 46% and FIEs about 15%. Since 1998, the relative contribution of foreign-\ninvested enterprises to GDP has risen 5%, while that of non-state enterprises has declined by \n4.4% and that of SOEs by 1%. In considering strictly industrial output, the total contribution of \nthe private sector rose to 63% in 2004, up from 52% in 1998. \n \n                                                 \n3  See, for example, United Nations Industrial Development Organization\u2013Ministry of Planning and Investment. 1999. \nAssistance to Industrial SMEs in Viet Nam.

Thus, one can say that \nalmost  all  non-state  registered  enterprises  are  SMEs.

Continued Growth of the Private Sector, 2004\u20132005   \n10.  Since 2004, the SME sector has continued to grow as the private sector has gained \nincreasing  importance  in  the  economy.  In  2004,  the  private  sector  produced  70%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s non-oil exports and 27% of total investment, and absorbed 39% of domestic bank \ncredit.4  The  exact  percentage  of  SMEs  as  a  component  of  the  private  sector  is  not \nsystematically recorded, but it is generally accepted to be around 90% of registered enterprises. \nSince 2002, formal private sector firms have created an increasing share of new jobs, rising \nfrom 37% in 2002 to 43% in 2004, as illustrated in Table A2.6. \n \nTable A2.6: Number of Jobs Created by Enterprise Sector, 2002\u20132004 \nEnterprise Ownership  2002  2003  2004 \nSOEs  2,260,306  2,264,942  2,249,902 \nNon-SOEs  1,706,409  2,049.891  2,475,448 \nFIEs   691,088  860,259  1,044,851 \nTotal  4,657,803  5,175,092  5,770,201 \nPercentage of non-SOEs  37%  40%  43% \nFIE = foreign invested enterprise; SOE = state-owned enterprise. \nSource: General Statistics Office \n \n11.  The private sector\u2019s share of total assets in the formal enterprise sector is also rising, \nfrom 16% in 2002 to 23% in 2004, as illustrated in Table A2.7. Since 2002, the relative share of \nmicro-, small- and medium-size enterprises in total employment by private, formal firms has \nremained stable. This suggests that all three subcategories of SMEs are growing in tandem with \nthe expansion of the private sector (footnote 4). \n  \nTable A2.7: Total Assets in Enterprise Sector, 2002\u20132004 (in D million) \nEnterprise Ownership  2002  2003  2004 \nSOEs  895,224,700  1,018,614,623  1,216,538,393 \nNon-SOEs  237,318,568  337,154,862  495,690,969 \nFIEs   308,195,714  368,788,194  449,274,253 \nTotal  1,440,738,982  1,724,557,679  2,161,503,615 \nPercentage of non-SOEs  16%  20%  23% \nSource: General Statistics Office \n \n                                                 \n4  Sources: Vietnam Development Report 2006.

Industrial growth is drawing on inexpensive labor and \nimproved infrastructure. Manufacturing, which accounts for about half of industry\u2019s value added, \nhas been a major contributor to gains in both output and employment, with output rising by 13% \nin 2005. Furniture and electronic goods account for a fast-rising share of total manufactured \nexports and, though the growth of clothing and footwear decelerated, they are still important. \nOverall, the proportion of light manufactured goods in total exports increased from 36% in 2001 \nto an estimated 40% in 2005. \n \n13.  Market  liberalization  continues  as  an  integral  part  of  the  country\u2019s  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  accession.  Official  recognition  of  the  private  sector\u2019s  contribution  to \neconomic activity is increasingly explicit, improving the prospects for further reforms toward a \nmarket-based economy. In 2005, the National Assembly passed a new Enterprise Law and a \nCommon Investment Law, designed to boost private investment by reducing administrative \nbarriers to business development and to facilitate WTO membership. Efforts to improve the \nbusiness climate have helped generate strong growth in both domestic private investment and \nforeign direct investment (FDI). Enterprise registrations are rising rapidly, with 162,672 new \nenterprises registered during 2000\u20132005, more than 3.2 times more than in 1991\u20131999 (see \nFigure A.2). 5 Some 39,951 private enterprises were newly registered in 2005, up from 14,400 in \n2000. \n \nFFiigguurree  AA22:.1 G: rGorwotwht hin i nN uNmumbebre or fo Rf eRgeigstisetreerde d \nEEnntteerrpprriisseess  aanndd  CCaappiittaall  22000000--22000055\n112200,000000   \n110000,000000 \n \n8800,000000\n6600,000000  \n4400,000000\n \n2200,000000\n \n00\n22000000 22000011 22000022 22000033 22000044 22000055\n \nrreeggiisstteerreedd  ccaappiittaall rreeggiisstteerreedd  eenntteerrpprriisseess\n \n \n14.  Private  sector  expansion  has  been  supported by  increased  access  to  finance. The \nprivate sector share of total domestic bank credit grew from 30% in 2003 to 40% in 2005. \nSimplified processes for LURC issuance and secured transactions have expanded the use of \ncollateral, further supporting this trend. According to the State Bank of Vietnam, the annual \ngrowth rate of banking credit to SMEs rose to an estimated 22% in 2005, up from 20% in 2004.  \n \nD.  Supporting Legislative Changes   \n15.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  supporting  SME  sector  development  has  been \ndemonstrated  in  a  series  of  legislative  and  institutional  reforms  since  2004.  The  principal \nreforms affecting the SME sector, and which have been supported by SDPL-Subprogram I, are \nsummarized below. \n                                                 \n5  Source: Agency for SME Development, 2006 ", "42  Appendix 2 \n \n(i)  Leveling the playing field. The new Enterprise Law and Common Investment \nLaw, promulgated in November 2005 and taking effect on 1 July 2006, further \nleveled  the  playing  field  for  all  enterprises  (private,  state-owned,  foreign), \nreduced the scope of the Government to impose licensing and other restrictions \non business, and simplified the licensing and registration process. Implementing \ndecrees for these laws are currently under development, and as such, the net \nimpact of these new laws on the SME sector will be measurable only after 2006.  \n \n(ii)  Improving  access  to  resources. The principal inhibitor to SME growth, as \ndetermined  by  numerous  surveys  and  statistical  analyses,  is  the  difficulty  in \naccessing  finance.  The  Government  has  been  addressing  this  constraint  by \nfurther formalizing the use of collateral assets (e.g., land use right certificates \n[LURCs], movable property) and the mechansims necessary for their effective \nuse  in  securing  bank  finance  (e.g.,  land  valuation,6  LURC  issuance  and \nregistration  systems, 7   secured  transaction  registration,  and  sale  of  lease \nreceivables). Pilot exercises to implement the simplified LURC issuance and \nregistration processes have been conducted in three provinces in 2005/2006, \nresulting in a set of documented workflows that can now be rolled out to other \nprovinces.  Development  of  the  National  Registration  Agency  for  Secured \nTransactions (NRAST) and supporting legislation, most notably amendments to \nthe Civil Code and implementing decrees to allow the prioritization of creditor and \nlien-holder  rights,  have  facilitated  the  use  of  both  movable  and  immovable \nproperty  as  collateral.  Activity  at  NRAST  has  been  increasing  every  year, \nreaching an average of 1,800 registered transactions per month in 2005. Pilot \nexercises for the sale of lease receivables, conducted from April to August 2006, \nresulted in D105 billion worth of transactions as of the end of June 2006. To \nfurther simplify the process of applying for credit and assessing credit risk, the \nGovernment has developed a new SME accounting framework, based on the \nnew general accounting system adopted by the Government in March 2006.8 \nThis framework will allow SMEs to use a more simplified set of accounts, better \nsuited to their business activities and resources.  \n \n(iii)  Improving the policy environment.  Under the SDPL, the Agency for SME \nDevelopment issued the country\u2019s first formal SME development strategy. The \nSME Development Five-Year Plan 2006-2010 is a long-term, multisectoral and \ninterministerial  program  designed  to  focus  and  integrate  government  policy \nactions in support of the sector. The Action Plan was submitted to the Minister of \nPlanning and Investment in January 2006, and is currently being finalized before \nsubmission to the Prime Minister for approval. The Action Plan, once approved, \nwill give the Government the ability to more effectively gather data on SMEs in \norder to track progress and guide future policy development. \n \n(iv)  Opening up export markets. Viet Nam has seen strong export growth since \n1997, with an average annual growth rate of 14% between 1997 and 2003, 30% \nin 2004, and 20% in 2005. Exports represented approximately 58% of GDP in \n                                                 \n6  Decree 188/2004/ND-CP and Circular 114/2004/TT-BTC. \n7  Circular  29/2004/TT-BTNMT  of  1  November  2004,  Decree  181/2004/ND-CP  of  29  October  2004,  Decision \n24/2004/QD-BTNMT, and Circular 01/2005/TT-BTNMT of 13 April 2005.  \n8  MOF Decision 15/2006/QD-BTC. ", "  Appendix 2  43 \n2004.  Rapid  export  growth  has  been  aided  by  bilateral  and  regional  trade \nagreements that came into effect during this period, most notably the ASEAN \nFree Trade Area (AFTA) and the US Bilateral Trade Agreement. In addition, \nWTO  commitments  are  likely  to  preserve  the  momentum  toward  domestic \nreforms. Further removal of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers and barriers to FDI \nwill facilitate the introduction of new technology, increased productivity, and the \ndevelopment of a more competitive economy. Moreover, when it does join WTO, \nViet Nam will be eligible for most-favored nation treatment by WTO members and \nwill no longer be subject to quotas\u2014a crucial point for the textile and clothing \nindustry (as well as footwear to some degree). \n \n16.  Further supporting the development of export markets has been the country\u2019s efforts to \nimprove the quality of domestic manufacturing. Various milestones, including (i) establishment \nof  industry  quality  standards;  (ii)  certification  mechanisms;  and  (iii)  mutual  recognition \nagreements  with  trading  partners,  have  facilitated  the  access  of  domestic  firms  to  foreign \nmarkets. Legislative reforms in support of export development (supported by the SDPL) have \nincluded (i) Decree 179/2004, providing for State Management over Goods Product Quality; (ii) \nDecision 50/2006, detailing the list of import and export products for which quality needs to be \nchecked by the state; (iii) the new Law on Standards and Technical Regulations (promulgated in \nJune  2006);  and  (iv)  Decree  115/2005,  calling  for  the  separation  of  the  commercial  and \nadministrative activities of STAMEQ. By the end of 2005, the number of firms receiving ISO \n9001-2000 certification increased to 1,682, up 5% from 1,598 in 2004. Similarly, the number of \nfirms receiving the National Quality Award increased from 96 in 2004 to 132 in 2005.  \n \n17.  Quantitative indicators of the impact of reforms supported through SDPL-Subprogram I \nshould become more pertinent in 2006\u20132008, as implementation takes hold with the adoption of \nand new polices, procedures, tools, and legislative frameworks. The momentum of reforms \ncreated under SDPL-Subprogram I is evident in the progress made to date in anticipation of \nSubprogram  II  policy  actions.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe Government\u2019s 10-year Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS) for 2001\u20132010 and Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (2006\u20132010) address pro-poor growth, employment generation, and poverty reduction through a \nstructural shift of the economy from agriculture to industry and services. Since the early 1990s, sustained overall \neconomic growth and private-sector-led employment generation have actually been major contributors to a sharp \ndecline in poverty in Viet Nam. The Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey in 2004 showed that the poverty rate \nfell from 58% in 1993 to 19.5% in 2004. Improvements in the social conditions, such as education levels and infant \nmortality, have been reflected in an increase in the country\u2019s ranking in the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s \nhuman development index.2   \n \nIn turn, the poverty assessment by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in its country strategy and program (CSP) for \n2007\u20132010 endorses the contribution of economic growth to poverty reduction, with particular attention to the roles of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and associated job creation in the industry and service sectors.3   \n \nIn particular, the proposed Subprogram II of the SME Development Program Loan (SDPL) Cluster will support \nimplementation of the country\u2019s new Enterprise Law, which is envisaged to ease entry barriers to start up formal \nbusinesses through reform in registration and licensing procedures. In the medium term, resulting competition among \nenterprises is expected to stimulate the economy\u2019s overall productivity, raising the potential growth rate. The benefits \nof improved productivity will be multiplied by improved access to financial resources by enterprises, also addressed by \nthe SDPL, further enriching the growth potentials. In Viet Nam, a strong positive correlation has been empirically \nobserved between a rise in per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and poverty reduction over the past decade \n(based on Viet Nam Living Standards Surveys in 1993, 1998, and 2002)4 and, if this trend continues in the years to \ncome, growth-oriented reforms supported by SDPL are likely to contribute positively to poverty reduction in an indirect \nmanner. \n \nSDPL-supported reforms would also have critical importance to mitigate the temporary adverse impacts, if any, which \nmay result from Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other reforms for the country\u2019s \ntransition to a market economy. In the process of trade liberalization adjustment, factors of production\u2014including \nlabor\u2014would have to shift from less productive sectors to more productive ones. Through streamlining the formal \nprocesses to start up new businesses, the SDPL will facilitate this adjustment process by creating new employment \nopportunities in the emerging competitive sectors, and hence relieve its negative impacts on the poor.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe findings from a number of empirical cross-country studies indicate a positive correlation between improvements in \nthe business environment and factors that contribute to poverty reduction. For instance, the quartiles group of \ncountries ranked as being less restrictive on business have been experiencing relatively higher economic growth \n(2.6%) compared with a groups of countries with a more difficult business environment (1.0%), and relatively \nbusiness-friendly countries are achieving a higher level of human development.5 Empirical cross-country evidence \n                                                 \n1  The Poverty Partnership Agreement was signed on 25 February 2002.   \n2  ADB. 2006.

As transaction of land use right certificates (LURCs) becomes \neasier, less productive households, which may comprise the poor, can choose to transfer the land they have received \nto more productive entities. This phenomenon may potentially bring about landlessness among the poor. However, in \nViet Nam, the population group that faces potential landlessness is the emerging middle class, rather than the poor, \nbecause they tend to move out of poverty at the time they move out of farming (which is land-intensive in nature). It is \nestimated that roughly three quarters of the overall increase in landlessness is associated with the decline in poverty.8 \nThus, more active land transaction is expected to bring about positive impacts on poverty reduction, and would not be \nan immediate cause for concerns. Rather, it is expected that formalization of the poor\u2019s de facto properties, such as \nLURCs, would allow proper use of these as collaterals and hence improve access to finance, which in turn would \nincrease their income opportunities.  \nIn summary, no adverse impact requiring mitigating measures has been identified to result from SDPL implementation. \n  \n \nC.

The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (the Government) is committed to poverty \nreduction as a primary objective of the country's development. To achieve the target for reducing incidence \nof  poverty  in  the  country,  there  must  be  rapid  economic  growth,  social  progress  and  equity,  and \ndevelopment of a corruption-free and strong state apparatus. Sector strategies for achieving these goals \nhave been delineated in the Socioeconomic Development Plan and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction \nand Growth Strategy (CPRGS). \n \n2.   To sustain rapid economic growth, realize social progress and equity and develop a corruption-free \nand  strong  state  apparatus,  the  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  establishing  an  enabling \nenvironment for the private sector, the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular, which make up \nmajority  of  the  private  sector.  CPRGS  targets  reduction  of  poverty  incidence  by  approximately  12 \npercentage points between 2001 and 2010. Economic growth required for Viet Nam to realize such target \nwill increasingly be dependent on the performance of the private/SME sector, perceived as the main engine \nfor the next round of economic growth. \n \n3.  Viet Nam has made series of efforts in support of the private sector. The Communist Party \nResolution  14/NQ-TW  (2002)  and  Prime  Minister's  Decision  94/2002/QD-TTg  (2002)  formally \nrecognized the private sector as an important pillar for economic development and employment generation. \nTo  support  the  SMEs,  the  Government  also  issued  Decree  90/2001/ND-CP  on  \"Support  for \nDevelopment of SMEs\" in November 2001 and officially indicated for the first time its solid commitment \nto support SME development in Viet Nam. Further, with the promulgation of the new Enterprise Law \n(NEL) in November 2005, the Government has laid the foundation for the continued reforms to promote \nthe development of the SME sector. \n \n4.  The Government recognizes the fact the SME sector still faces many challenges in creating an \nenabling business environment in Viet Nam due in part to its incomplete policy, legal, and institutional \nframeworks in support of business operations. However, the Government's commitment to meet and \novercome these challenges is strong in order to establish an environment conducive to the development of \nan efficient, market-oriented SME sector. The process for building such an environment is viewed by the \nGovernment as being indispensable for the country to achieve its target economic growth and prosperity that \nis free of poverty. \n \n   ", "54  Appendix 5   \nTHE PROGRAM \n \n5.  To establish an environment conducive to development of an efficient market-oriented SME sector, \nthe Government agrees with the need to undertake the proposed Subprogram II under the support of SME \nDevelopment Program Loan Cluster (SDPL) from ADB and put in place: (i) improved current business \nregistration and licensing systems; (ii) policy and institutional framework for SME development; and (iii) \nSME's enhanced access to financial and physical resources; (iv) legal framework for land to allow market-\nbased transactions; and (v) SME's enhanced access to international markets. \n \nA.  Improving the Current Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n \n6.  Although the original Enterprise Law simplified business registration by reducing time, cost, and \ndocumentation requirements, recent guidelines and their interpretation by local authorities have not been \nconsistent with the law, resulting in further complications for SMEs. Similarly, while the number of licenses \nrequired decreased after the Enterprise Law was passed, new licenses have emerged, imposing an additional \nburden on both SMEs and the government administration. There is a clear need to rationalize existing \nlicenses and to apply standard approaches to limit the number of new licenses. While the business licensing \nreform plan, as a decree under the NEL, has been drafted, the Government is committed to further \nestablish the institutional capacity to implement it effectively, so as to fully reflect the specific features and \noverall spirit of the new NEL. \n \n7.  Effectively of the new NEL in July 2006 has launched the new phase of related reforms. These \ninclude an  expansion  of  the National Business Information Network  (NBIN)-the business registration \nsystem-to  cover  at  least  5  provinces  and  to  provide  information  to  the  private  sector  on  licensing \nrequirements and procedures. In addition, a legal framework to further improve the registration process, \nwhich will occur based on inter-ministerial coordination, will be issued as well.   \n \nB.  Establishing Policy and Institutional Framework for SME Development \n \n8.  The many and varied constraints facing SMEs mean that their development requires vision, strategic \ndirection, and effective coordination between the different stakeholders in policy delivery, both horizontally \nand vertically. There has in the past been no overall national development plan that could fulfill these \nfunctions. Support programs remain uncoordinated and often overlap, reducing their impact. \n \n9.  The Government formulated an SME development action plan, but its implementation requires \nfurther assistance. In particular, the action plan needs to be disseminated to major stakeholders and SMEs \nand an assessment made of its overall impact - in a form of report on the state of the SME sector. The \nGovernment  also  needs  support  for  the  coordinated  implementation  of  its  policy  and  institutional \nframework for the development of the SME sector, including more active involvement by the private sector. \nThe Government is also keen to have ADB play an important role in stakeholder coordination and has been \nserving as the co-chair of the SME partnership group (made up of funding agencies, government agencies, \nand private sector representatives). Further, as a system to disseminate the necessary information to SMEs \nhas been developed, it will require support for effective implementation and maintenance. \n \nC.   Enhancing SME's Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n \n10.  Access to finance remains one of the most critical issues for the SMEs. The costs and risks related \nto lending to SMEs need to be addressed. First, the Government has recognized that limited access to land \nuse  rights  certificates  (LURCs)  reduces  their  use  for  collateral  purposes.  The  legal  and  regulatory \nframework  under  which  LURCs  are  issued  needs  to  be  formalized  and  registration  procedures  for \nsubsequent transactions  need to  be streamlined and unified. SMEs'  access  to  finance  would  also  be \nimproved by an effective secured transactions registry that clearly prioritizes creditors' and lien holders' ", "    Appendix 5          55 \n \nrights upon registration. Lack of collateral is compounded by unreliable financial information on SMEs. \nHere, it is important to ensure effective functionalities of the registries for both land and movable \nproperties - based on sound legal framework, which the Government is committed to formulate and \nimplement. Second, financial reporting requirements are felt to be complex and difficult to comply with. \nImplementation  of  the  simplified  SME  accounting  system  that  adheres  to  International  Accounting \nStandards needs to be promoted. Considerable training is needed to ensure that SMEs are fully familiar \nwith the accounting- system and guidelines. Finally, as leasing represents a key financial product for SMEs, \nthe State Bank of Viet Nam has been working to specify policies and procedures for (i) sale of lease \nreceivables, (ii) sale and lease back transactions and (iii) syndicated leasing. A pilot program was launched \nin March 2006 to test the sale of lease receivables. Continued improvements in the current legal \nframework are envisioned. \n \nD.  Completing the Legal Framework for Land to Allow Market-based Transactions \n \n11.  The  Government  improved  the  LURC  issuance  process  in  a group  of  pilot  provinces and will \nformulate a plan for a full nationwide expansion of the process. Based on the Law of 2003, registration \nprocesses emphasized transparency, simplification, uniformity and standardization and compliance within \nthe current legal framework. Electronic linkages were developed between the land transaction offices and \ntwo other principle regulators in the land administration framework (the departments of the natural \nresources and environments and the Local People's Committee), so that data on land use, ownership and \nsubdivision changes could be shared. In the next phase, the Government aims to plan for a national rollout \nof the registries for land. In addition, the Government. is also committed to effectively implement new \nguidelines for land valuation for use by local authorities (Decree 188/2004/ND-CP and Circular \n114/20041TT-BTC). Market-based land valuation is a key innovation of the new Land Law, as land has \ntraditionally been priced by People's Committees for purposes of taxation and compensation \n \nE.  Enhancing SME's Access to International Markets \n \n12.  As SMEs look to access international markets, a good framework on technical standards helps to \ncreate a common trading language, and reduce costs for manufacturing and warehousing. For governments, \nstandards offer an opportunity for deregulation and improved governance as they help to ease the level of \nregulatory  details  to  essential  requirements  for  health  protection,  safety,  and  the  environment. \nStandardization is therefore a key part of microeconomic infrastructure that is still in the development phase \nin Viet Nam. The Government is committed to developing industrial and technical standards in conformity \nwith best international practices, which promote participation of all stakeholders, including SMEs. This will \nbe achieved through improving the current legal framework. Also, it will ensure that involved institutions \nwill be reformed to separate its commercial and public administrative activities, and will function based on \npublic private pay partnership.   \nPROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION \n \n13.  The Government understands that successful Subprogram II implementation depends on the \nability of the Executing Agency to undertake reform measures in a timely manner. Strong support will be \nrequired from all Government ministries and agencies concerned as well as the ability of the Executing \nAgency to coordinate and execute the Program components to fully meet the objectives of the Subprogram. \nAs such, the Government has chosen the Ministry of Planning and Investment as the Executing Agency. \nContinuance of the existing SDPL Program Steering Committee (PSC) ensures that the Subprogram is \nimplemented as planned. The PSC, chaired by Vice Minister of MPI, comprises senior officers from all \nministries  and  government  agencies  concerned,  including  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Justice, and State Bank \nof Viet Nam. Likewise, the SDPL Program Implementation and Coordination Unit within MPI, headed by a \nsenior officer of MPI (Agency for SME Development), assists the PSC and ADB on the responsibility for \nday-to-day implementation of the Subprogram. ", "56  Appendix 5   \n \n14.  The Government will dedicate counterpart funds generated from the loan to ensure that policy \nconditions are fully implemented. \n \nTHE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST \n \n15.  The Government Emily believes that economic development can only be sustained by undertaking \nrefonn measures that would improve economic efficiency and productivity of the country. Prior consultation \nand dialogue with ADB have put in place the frameworks as well as the sequence of necessary actions to \nenhance the business environment for SMEs. \n \n16.  The Government is committed to undertake the policy actions under Subprogram II of the SDPL. \nThe Government is confident that it can implement the proposed reforms and achieve the objectives of the \nSDPL. The Government will therefore seek ADB's consideration for a program loan of $20 million to \nsupport the policy reforms committed under Subprogram II of the SDPL. The Government will collaborate \nclosely with ADB in implementing the proposed reforms to facilitate the process and ensure that it conforms \nto the requirements of the Subprogram. \n17.  With the successful implementation of the SDPL, the Government aims to support development of \nthe SME sector in Viet Nam. This would be a necessary condition for sustaining Viet Nam/s economic \ngrowth and thereby reduce incidents of poverty in the country.   \nYours sincerely, \n \n \n \n \nVo Hong Phuc  \nMinister \nMinistry of Planning and Investment \n \n ", "  Appendix 6    57 \n \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nProject/Program  Source  Timing Rationale and Demand for Assistance  Cost  \n1.
