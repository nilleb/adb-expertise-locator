INTRODUCTION \n1.  The compilation of supply and use tables (SUTs) is one of the critical recommendations \nin the United Nations (UN) System of National Accounts (SNA). SUTs are considered the most \nintegrated framework showing the sources of supply of goods and services\u2014produced in the \ndomestic economy or imported\u2014and where and how these are used, either for intermediate \nconsumption or final use.1 Likewise, SUTs provide the basic framework for the construction of \nnational and international input\u2013output tables (IOTs). The latter are an essential input into the \nanalysis  of  a  variety  of  important  economic  phenomena.  An  important  application  of  an \ninternational IOT is in improving the economic content of standard trade statistics.2 International \nIOTs are also key to understanding structural transformation across economies; measuring the \nextent of regional integration in production and trade; and documenting key aspects of vertical \nspecialization and how certain policy shifts, such as reductions in tariffs and transport costs, can \nlead to extensive vertical specialization, large trade growth, and large gains from trade. These \nare relatively new knowledge frontiers for which data is lacking in developing member countries \n(DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n2.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  part  of  the  continuing  efforts  of  ADB\u2019s \nEconomics and Research Department (ERD) to support evidence-based decision making with \nimproved and detailed information on national accounts estimates. Its outputs will provide the \ntools for analyzing a range of economic phenomena, including the analysis of global value \nchains. The TA will also enable ERD to continue its collaborative statistical work with national \nstatistics offices (NSOs), and to support and sustain the development of IOTs for guiding policy \nmaking on both inclusive growth and regional cooperation and integration issues. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In April 2008, the UN Statistical Commission recommended the adoption of the 2008 \nSNA to bring the national accounting framework in line with new developments and to meet the \nincreasing demands of data users. It acknowledged that the economic environment in many \neconomies had evolved significantly since the development of the 1993 SNA and that recent \nmethodological research had led to improved methods of measuring some of the more difficult \ncomponents  of  the  national  accounts.  The  adoption  of  the  2008  SNA  also  supports  the \nimplementation of the Regional Program on Economic Statistics endorsed by the heads of \nNSOs of member economies at the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific\u2019s Committee on Statistics, of which ADB is a member. \n \n4.  In 2012 ADB published a research study on the Supply and Use Tables for Selected \nEconomies in Asia and the Pacific, under a regional TA project.4 It contains national SUTs for 18 \neconomies based on the 1993 SNA. Being a first for most participating economies, the SUTs \nvaried in their reference year, with some going as far back as 2005. Further, in the recently \n                                                \n1 The SUT framework ensures consistency of data at the detailed product level between industries and products \n(intermediate consumption), and final uses, and the reconciliation of estimates of gross domestic product from the \nproduction, expenditure, and income approaches. \n2  The growth of international trade in intermediate inputs means that trade statistics can give a misleading picture of \nthe real patterns of production behind world trade. International IOTs based on high-quality SUTs allow trade \npatterns to be decomposed into components that better reflect the underlying location of the value addition linked \nto exports. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 November 2014. \n4  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance Completion Report: Adopting the Supply and Use Framework towards 1993 \nSystem of National Account Compliance in Selected Developing Member Countries. Manila (TA 6483-REG); ADB. \n2012. Supply and Use Tables for Selected Economies in Asia and the Pacific, A Research Study. Manila.  \n ", "2 \nconcluded 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP), only 5 out of 22 economies have \nadopted the 2008 SNA; 13 are compliant with the 1993 SNA; and 4 are at different levels of \n1968, 1993, and 2008 SNA compliance. There is a need therefore, to sustain the gains of the \nresearch study to further develop the statistical capacity and skills acquired in SUT compilation; \nand strengthen data sources to fill data gaps at product, industry, and enterprise levels. It is also \ncritical to assist countries in adopting the recommendations of the 2008 SNA in compiling the \nbenchmark and annual national SUTs to further improve statistical capacity building in ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member economies. \n \n5.  Apart from being important for national economic analyses and planning, consistent and \ninternationally comparable SUTs are imperative in a highly globalized market. SUTs are critical \nin constructing international IOTs used for inter-country analysis of trade in value addition and \nglobal value chains. Despite the critical role of input\u2013output statistics in both national accounts \nand  economic  analysis,  comparable  and  consistent  IOTs  for  Asian  economies  in  existing \ninternational IOT databases5 are limited and are available only for certain benchmark years. The \nTA will not only help economies adopt the 2008 SNA to the extent possible, it will also provide \nnew internationally comparable data for consistent industrial analysis at a detailed sector level \nand international IOTs over time. It will maximize the benefits of having the national perspective \nof economies to address the underlying limitations of existing international IOT databases, \nespecially  in  terms  of  understanding  the  uniqueness  of  each  economy  and  in  further \ndecomposing enterprise and household data in relation to national and international trade and \ntransactions. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  impact  will  be  increased  implementation  of  international  standards  in  national \naccounts compilation and increased comparability of data across economies. The outcome will \nbe  improved  capability  of  NSOs  for  measuring  levels  of  economic  output  and  increased \navailability of SUT data for upstream and downstream analysis and research. By the end of the \nproject, it is envisaged that (i) all participating economies are able to compile benchmark and/or \nupdated SUTs based on latest data and in accordance with international standards, (ii) gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  estimates  of  participating  economies  will  incorporate  2008  SNA \nrecommendations to the extent possible, (iii) reliable and accurate data for measuring and \nmonitoring economic output will be made available, and (iv) outputs are used for time series and \ncross-country analysis of economic outputs and structures for the region. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Twenty-one ADB member economies will be invited to participate in the TA. 6 To achieve \nthe desired outcome, the TA will have five major activities: (i) preparatory work; (ii) updating and \n                                                \n5  In terms of coverage, the Institute of Developing Economies\u2013Japan External Trade Organization covers seven \nDMCs; the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, six; and the European Commission for the \nWorld Input\u2013Output Database, three. \n6  The 21 economies are: Bangladesh; Bhutan; Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; People\u2019s Republic of China; Fiji; \nHong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Maldives; Mongolia; Nepal; \nPakistan; Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. Brunei Darussalam; Hong \nKong, China; Singapore; and Taipei,China will be requested to fund their own participation. Except for the Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Pakistan,  and  the  Philippines,  these  economies  participated  in  ADB.  2008. \nTechnical Assistance for Adopting the Supply and Use Framework Toward 1993 System of National Accounts \nCompliance in Selected Developing Member Countries. Manila (TA 6483-REG, completed in December 2013). The \n ", "3 \nconstructing  of  the  benchmark  national  SUTs  based  on  the  2008  SNA  recommendations; \n(iii) estimating the time series annual national SUTs for selected economies incorporating the \nlatest  available  data;  (iv)  constructing  the  time  series  Asian  international  IOTs  that  are \nharmonized with national SUTs, and bilateral trade statistics; and (v) conducting regional and in-\ncountry technical discussions, workshops, and training for national accounts staff, statisticians, \nand economists in economies on compiling and updating SUT and GDP aggregates following \nthe 2008 SNA recommendations. \n \n8.  Preparatory work will involve the recruitment of consultants, building partnerships with \neconomies, and a project inception workshop. Bearing in mind the detailed data requirements \nfor implementing the TA, it is recommended that participating economies be grouped by level of \ncompliance and scope of implementation of the SNA; and the availability of a SUT either as \nproduced  by  the  country  or  as  an  output  of  ADB\u2019s  TA  on  Adopting  the  Supply  and  Use \nFramework Toward 1993 System of National Accounts Compliance in Selected Developing \nMember Countries. Assessment of economies based on these two criteria will help determine \ndata availability, the level of statistical capacity, and the type of assistance that will be required \nto produce the outputs. Initial institutional capacity assessment will be conducted by ERD, in \nconsultation  with  the  economies.  Since  it  will  also  involve  data  assessment  and  SNA \ncompliance  review,  the  correspondence  tables  of  international  standards  and  classification \nsystems7 developed  by  ERD  under  the  said  TA  will  be  updated  to  incorporate  the  latest \navailable standards from the UN Statistics Divisions. \n \n9.  Estimating the updated and/or benchmark national SUT for participating economies \nbased  on  the  2008  SNA  recommendations  will  include  the  review  of  concepts  and \nmethodologies related to the 2008 and 1993 SNA recommendations. Economies\u2019 sources of \nproducts (domestic production plus imports) will then be identified and classified in the supply \ntables. Likewise, the uses of the products (intermediate consumption, final consumption, and \nexport) and other primary factors, as well as the derivation of gross value added (the difference \nbetween gross output and intermediate consumption) will be developed to construct the use \ntables. The two tables will be linked to form a matrix table such that the total supply of a product \nwill always be equal to the total use of that product. For the 18 economies that were part of \nADB\u2019s  TA  for  Adopting  the  Supply  and  Use  Framework  toward  1993  System  of  National \nAccounts Compliance in Selected Developing Member Countries, the possibility of increasing \nthe level of disaggregation of the SUTs from 51 products by 32 industries will be considered, \napart from updating their benchmark SUTs using the latest available data. For the other three \neconomies,  benchmark  SUTs  will  be  constructed  using  ADB\u2019s  phased  approach  to  SUT \ncompilation, which was instrumental for the successful estimation of the SUTs in the said TA. \nConduct of censuses and surveys vary from country to country, which implies that the reference \nyears for updated and benchmark SUTs at this stage will be different across economies. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nsame economies were also part of the 2005 and 2011 ICPs and, at a meeting of the heads of national \nimplementing agencies in April 2014, signified interest in sustaining collaborative work on the ICP, including \nimprovements in national accounts estimation. Myanmar, although part of the 2011 ICP, is excluded from the TA to \navoid duplication with the ongoing ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for \nCapacity Development of the National Statistical System. Manila (TA 8377-MYA), which includes development of \nnational accounts with SUTs as one of its major outputs. \n7  The UN Statistics Division maintains the international classifications of activity, product, and expenditure according \nto purpose, while the World Trade Organization maintains the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding \nSystem, also known as the Harmonized System of tariff nomenclature (latest of which is 2007). Correspondence \ntables between each classification system, where applicable, are available from the UN Statistics Division website \nat http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regot.asp?Lg=1. \n ", "4 \n10.  The time series annual national SUTs for selected economies incorporating the \nlatest available data will be estimated. The TA will also utilize the results of household and \nenterprise (economic) surveys and censuses, and maximize the use of administrative sources, \nto minimize response burden and reduce costs. The updated and benchmark SUTs, produced \nby each economy at the earlier stage, will be the starting point for estimating the time series \nSUTs.  Upon  evaluation  of  available  methods  for  updating  SUTs,  and  assessment  of  the \navailability of additional data required for constructing national and international IOTs, time \nseries national SUTs will be estimated for selected economies. To maintain consistency with \nofficial statistics and increase the reliability of results, estimation of the time series SUTs will be \nharmonized with the published national accounts estimates of each economy. Evaluation and \nreconciliation of trade statistics are also crucial at this stage given that international IOTs will be \nconstructed. \n \n11.  In constructing the time series annual international IOTs that are harmonized with \nnational SUTs and bilateral trade statistics, the national SUTs will serve as the building \nblocks  for  constructing  the  proposed  international  IOTs.  This  is  a  similar  to  the  approach \nadopted  in  the  construction  of  the World  Input\u2013Output  Database.  Nonetheless,  alternative \napproaches for transforming SUT to IOT will also be explored, apart from adopting the fixed-\nproduct  sales  assumptions  used  in  the  construction  of  the  World  Input\u2013Output  Database. \nSimilarly, identification of errors followed by manual and mechanical balancing, adopted by the \nInstitute of Developing Economies\u2013Japan External Trade Organization in constructing the Asian \nIOTs will also be explored. To the extent possible, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) Plus Three economies will be included in the initial set of international IOTs. For other \nmajor trading partners of economies in the region and the rest of the world, estimates will be \nobtained from existing international IOT databases or other sources, as deemed necessary. \n \n12.  National  accounts  staff,  statisticians,  and  economists in  economies  will be \ntrained on estimating and updating SUT and GDP aggregates following the 2008 SNA \nrecommendations  through  conduct  of  regional  and  in-country  technical  discussions, \nworkshops, and training as well as on-line technical assistance. ADB\u2019s phased approach to SUT \ncompilation, as taken in the TA for Adopting the Supply and Use Framework toward 1993 \nSystem of National Accounts Compliance in Selected Developing Member Countries, which \nworked well without overwhelming the national implementing agencies (NIAs), will be used \nagain. This phased implementation means that regular technical discussion and workshops at \neach  stage  of  compilation  will  be  conducted.  The  approach  encourages  participative, \nconsultative, and learning-by-doing practices that are essential for the success of the project, \nthe sustainability of the national SUT compilation, and the regular updating of international IOTs. \n \n13.  ADB will also convene periodic regional meetings of heads of NIAs and/or national \ncoordinators and technical staff to review the status of TA implementation, provide inputs into \nthe evaluation of the quality of country data submitted, and provide guidance toward further \nimproving the TA processes and/or outputs. Where identified methodological and data issues \nare country-specific and cannot be resolved in regional meetings and/or workshops or via e-mail \nor videoconferencing, country missions may be conducted. Additionally, TA project specialists \nand/or staff will participate in meetings and/or seminars organized by the UN Statistics Division \nand other relevant international organizations to keep abreast of current developments relevant \nto the TA, such as new or revised international standards. The latter is considered within the \nscope of the TA because it will increase the relevance of the project outputs. \n \n14.  The TA will use several avenues to disseminate good practices and lessons learned \nsuch as (i) sharing experiences and discussing issues related to data quality and estimation \n ", "5 \nprocedures during regional workshops, (ii) in-country technical missions, (iii) participation in \nregional and international meetings and/or seminars in areas related to the TA, (iv) publication \nof working papers and notes, (v) publication of the TA results, (vi) Communication, coordination \nand collaboration Tools Website on SNA for knowledge-sharing, and (vii) maintenance of the \ndata and research web page in the ADB portal. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. The governments of NIAs will provide counterpart support in the form of office \nspace, staff resources, and other in-kind contributions. Where applicable, cost sharing and \neligibility of expenditures for ADB financing8 will be adhered to. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency, and ERD will handle the TA administration in \ncollaboration with the NSOs of selected economies, which will be the NIAs over a period of 3 \nyears. The NIAs will coordinate country-level activities. Where costs of country-level activities \n(such as data collection, country workshops, and trainings) are to be administered by the NIA, \nfunds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures and requirements of ADB\u2019s advance \npayment  facility.  No-objection  confirmation  will  be  obtained  from  the  government  of  each \nparticipating DMC prior to starting the TA activities in each DMC, in coordination with the \nrespective regional departments. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from January 2015 to December 2018, and will finance \n80 person-months of consulting services: 6 person-months international and 74 person-months \nnational. Consultants will be selected and engaged individually by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  Development  Indicators  and  Policy \nResearch  Division  of  ADB\u2019s  ERD  will  designate  a  national  staff  member  for  contract \nadministration  on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure  smooth  TA  processing  and  implementation. \nCollaboration with selected international organizations will be established, wherever possible, in \nthe course of TA implementation9, and individual resource persons will be engaged for not more \nthan 10 working days to source expertise for providing need-based technical support. \n \n18.  Procurement and disbursement will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, \nas amended from time to time) and Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). Proper turnover of equipment, where applicable, will also be \nensured at the project\u2019s completion date. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nUpdating  and  Constructing  the  Supply  and  Use  Tables  for  Selected  Developing  Member \nEconomies, and hereby reports this action to the Board.    \n                                                \n8 Please refer to ADB. 2012.
