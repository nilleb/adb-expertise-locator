INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the strengthening of \ninstitutional mechanisms of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program \nto expedite the implementation of projects and initiatives.1 National institutional mechanisms will \nbe operationalized in each SASEC member country, with expanded functions; and a SASEC \nsecretariat will be established in the subregion. For effective operation of these mechanisms, the \nTA  will  also  support  capacity  building  and  knowledge  activities  for  the  planning  and \nimplementation of projects and initiatives of the SASEC member countries.2 \n \n2.  The TA is not included in any country operations business plan or regional cooperation \nbusiness plan, but is directly linked to the goals and mission of the SASEC vision\u2014SASEC: \nPowering Asia in the 21st Century\u2014to propel the subregion to become Asia\u2019s key growth driver \nby 2025; and to the updated SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025, which is closely aligned with \nthe strategic thrusts of the SASEC vision.3 The proposed strengthening of SASEC institutional \nmechanisms was discussed and endorsed at the virtual SASEC Nodal Officials\u2019 Meeting (NOM) \nin August 2020. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In April 2017, the SASEC finance ministers launched the SASEC vision in Delhi, which \nwas motivated by the subregion\u2019s impressive growth, abundant natural resources, and rapidly \nevolving infrastructure. The SASEC countries then identified strategic levers\u2014promoting industry-\nto-industry links, leveraging resource-based industries, and expanding the region\u2019s trade and \ncommerce\u2014to achieve the targets in realizing the vision\u2019s goal of sustainable and inclusive \neconomic growth. With this vision, SASEC entered a new phase of cooperation. \n \n4.  The SASEC program is also guided by the updated SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025, \nwhich presents a holistic perspective of where SASEC stands in three areas of cooperation \n(transport, trade facilitation, and energy). The updated operational plan contains a streamlined \npipeline of 112 proposed projects with financing requirements of about $58.90 billion, of this, \n78 projects have identified financing of about $45.84 billion. The updated operational plan is \nenvisaged to spur the interest of member governments and development partners in considering \nSASEC projects in their programming discussions. \n \n5.  In August 2020, the NOM discussed the draft Action Plan of SASEC Initiatives (APSI), \nwhich  identifies  a  subset  of  projects  in  the  updated  SASEC  operational  plan  for  priority \nimplementation during 2021\u20132023. The APSI contains the SASEC program\u2019s strategic objectives \nand initiatives, which include (i) multimodal corridor initiatives based on the network of SASEC \nroad corridors; (ii) sector initiatives, such as energy and trade facilitation measures; and (iii) new \ninitiatives addressing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), such as supply chain mapping and \nleveraging the use of digital technology to enable SASEC build more resiliency and sustainability \nin the long term. The NOM endorsed the strategic directions and approaches of the APSI, 2021\u2013\n2023, which will be updated every 3 years. \n \n1  The SASEC program brings together Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in a \nproject-based partnership to promote regional prosperity, improve economic opportunities, and build a better quality \nof life for the people of the subregion. The SASEC program started in 2001 with Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and \nNepal as the participating countries. Maldives and Sri Lanka joined in 2014 and Myanmar in 2017. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n27 November 2020. \n3  ADB. 2017. South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Vision: Powering Asia in the 21st Century. Manila; and \nADB. 2020. South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025 Update. Manila. \n ", "2 \n6.  For 19 years, the SASEC program has operated on an institution-light, project-heavy \nformat. Its mechanisms for facilitation and coordination, as well as the platforms for discussion \namong members, consist of (i) SASEC nodal officials, who meet at least annually to review and \nprovide strategic direction and guidance for cooperation under the program; (ii) working groups \nand subgroups, which meet at least once a year to review project priorities and progress; and \n(iii) the SASEC secretariat, which is based at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) headquarters \nand supported by regional cooperation specialists and focal points in ADB\u2019s resident missions.  \n \n7.  The SASEC mechanisms have served the program well as the countries  have the \nflexibility to proceed at their own pace. SASEC TA completion reports have shown that SASEC \nmechanisms and discussion platforms have been instrumental and dynamic in fostering close \ncooperation among members on projects, reforms, and initiatives.4 However, as the program \nfaces intensified and increasing new demands and the pursuit of the SASEC vision through the \nupdated SASEC operational plan and the APSI, SASEC institutional mechanisms need to be \nstrengthened. The enhancements in the existing institutional mechanisms and arrangements aim \nto ensure that the SASEC vision provides a coherent and strategic direction for the SASEC \nprogram; and that the updated SASEC operational plan and the APSI set the framework, \nguidelines, and priorities for more deliberate planning and accelerated implementation of regional \ncooperation projects. \n \n8.  The TA will enhance the SASEC arrangements for coordinating seamless, multimodal \ncross-border  infrastructure;  and  further  strengthen  the  SASEC  program\u2019s  collective  action, \nknowledge  sharing,  and  policy  dialogue  toward  stronger  connectivity,  more  efficient  trade \nprocesses, and sustainable energy development. The TA thus supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational priority of fostering regional cooperation and integration,5 and contributes to the \nattainment of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).6  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  economic  cooperation  and  integration \nbetween  SASEC member countries,  and  between  SASEC  and  its  neighboring  subregions, \naccelerated (footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: the implementation of SASEC \nprograms, projects, and initiatives accelerated.7 To measure the achievement of the outcome, \ndirect indicators will be used in terms of projects included in the APSI with firm financing \nrequirements.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  The four TA outputs will establish an enhanced institutional setup for SASEC. The TA \naims to improve the existing informal setup where nodal officials have limited power to address \nbottlenecks in their countries. The TA will also put in place measures to ensure extensive \nconsultations with relevant agencies are conducted in order to mitigate the risk of delays due to \n \n4  For example, ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance Completion Report: Support for South Asia Regional Economic \nIntegration. Manila (TA 7491-REG). \n5  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n6  The  TA  will  contribute  to  SDG  1,  ending  poverty;  SDG  5,  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment; \nSDG 7, affordable and clean energy; SDG 8, decent work and economic growth; and SDG 9, industry, innovation, \nand infrastructure resilience. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nadministrative processes. The APSI, once endorsed by the SASEC finance ministers, will provide \na strong impetus for sustaining the availability of resources for SASEC initiatives.8 \n   \n11.  Output  1:  Regional  and  national  institutional  mechanisms  enhanced.  The \nenhancements of institutional arrangements will involve (i) recognizing the overarching role of the \nSASEC Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting (FMM) as an oversight body; (ii) upgrading the role of the \nSASEC nodal officials to become the SASEC senior officials with expanded functions; and \n(iii) establishing SASEC national committees (SNCs) to be headed by the SASEC senior officials.   \n \n12.  An  overarching  body  at  the  political  level\u2014the  finance  ministers\u2014is  essential  to \nstrengthen the countries\u2019 commitment to facilitating policy change and resource allocation beyond \nproject identification. The finance ministers will decide on strategic and policy-related matters and \nprovide guidance on the SASEC program\u2019s overall direction. At the NOM in August 2020, the \nnodal officials endorsed a proposal for the SASEC finance ministers to meet regularly\u2014every 3 \nyears, or more frequently as needed\u2014to demonstrate increased commitment to and ownership \nof the SASEC vision.   \n \n13.  The senior officials will provide strategic and technical support to the finance ministers and \nensure continuity of projects and initiatives in their respective countries. Mechanism for SASEC \nactivities differs in each member country but generally it is led by the Nodal Official. Some \ncountries have more formal coordination arrangements compared to others, while some have \nbroader sector agency representation within their national committees. The senior officials will \nconvene SNCs to perform SASEC project planning, programming, and implementation in their \ncountries. The establishment of SNCs will depend on each country\u2019s legal arrangements. The \n \nSNCs will comprise senior officials from government agencies involved with SASEC. \n \n14.    The senior officials\u2014the Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting (SOM) as a group\u2014will be accountable \nto the FMM and will perform strategic and operational responsibilities beyond coordination. The \nSOM\u2019s main functions will be to ensure the alignment of the priorities, policies, and operation of \nthe program with the SASEC vision, and to recommend new areas of cooperation. The SOM will \nmeet at least once a year, and report to the FMM on the progress of the SASEC program.  \n \n15.  Output 2: Working groups for program-, project-, and task-related initiatives and \nresolution of issues strengthened. Working groups will continue to focus on program, project \nactivities  and  initiatives,  along  sector  and  thematic  or  multisector  lines.  They  may  create \nsubgroups for highly technical tasks, as subcommittees, expert groups, or task forces. The \nfunctions of the working groups will involve the identification, prioritization, implementation, and \nmonitoring of SASEC projects and initiatives; and engage with the private sector whenever \npossible. The working groups will meet at least once a year and report to the SOM. The TA will \n(i) support the conduct of meetings of the working groups, subcommittees, expert groups and/or \ntask forces; and (ii) develop a pipeline subregional programs and projects endorsed by the SOM \nannually. \n \n16.  Output 3: South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Secretariat established \nand operationalized in the subregion. The subregional secretariat will be set up at ADB\u2019s India \nResident  Mission  to  serve  as  a  mechanism  for  facilitating  coordinated  planning  and \nimplementation of SASEC investment plans, projects, and reforms, in a faster and more effective \n \n8  The updated SASEC operational plan contains 112 projects totaling $58.90 billion, with and without financing. The \ndraft APSI, 2021\u20132023, which was discussed at the NOM and working groups and subgroup meetings in August\u2013\nOctober 2020, contains 70 projects from the SASEC operational plan totaling $27.68 billion. The APSI will be updated \nbiannually, and the next update will contain at least 60% of the projects in the SASEC operational plan. \n ", "4 \nmanner\u2014intra-country,  intercountry,  and  subregion-wide.  ADB  has  been functioning  as  the \nSASEC secretariat at its headquarters and has performed the role of regional advisor and lead \nfinancier of the program. However, as SASEC has expanded and its resources have become \nmore diversified, the arrangement requires revisiting. Setting up secretariat functions in the \nsubregion will enhance the SASEC program\u2019s performance by bringing its operations closer to \nthe people who will benefit from its function. The director of ADB\u2019s South Asia Department\u2019s \nRegional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division will be its member secretary. \n \n17.  The subregional secretariat will support the FMM, SOM, and working groups in carrying \nout  their  functions;  mobilize  financial  resources  and  technical  expertise  from  development \npartners and the private sector for projects and initiatives; coordinate with other subregional \nprograms; provide analytical work for and report to the SOM. The secretariat will also serve as a \nknowledge center to promote knowledge exchange and the exploration of knowledge solutions to \nhelp the SASEC countries make decisions. This model could attract resources from development \npartners for specific knowledge activities, and for their wider engagement in the SASEC process.  \n \n18.  The SASEC subregional secretariat will facilitate efficient coordination of the activities of \nthe various SNCs that will be set up, in addition to providing technical and other support to \nmeetings of the FMM, SOM, and various working groups.  \n \n19.  Output 4: Capacity of South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation member \ncountries to plan, implement, and monitor projects and initiatives strengthened. The TA \nwill conduct knowledge events, studies, and training courses  to enhance the learning and \ncapacities of the member countries in areas affecting the program. Good practices and lessons \nfrom  other  regional  cooperation  programs  such  as  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic \nCooperation Program (GMS) and Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) will \nalso be introduced. The TA will also finance analytical work, which will include knowledge sharing, \nto be held back-to-back with working group and subgroup meetings.9 A limited quantity of \npublications will be printed and made available at the knowledge center.  \n \n20.  Knowledge dissemination is being supported by the SASEC web team in ADB. This \ninvolves maintaining the SASEC website as the repository of information on the SASEC program, \nprojects, and events; news on South Asia regional cooperation; and related publications. It will \nalso provide a snapshot of intraregional trade in SASEC. The TA will support enhancements in \nthe form and substance of the website; and in maintaining and updating its contents and social \nmedia accounts (Facebook and Twitter), and monthly e-newsletter, with a growing number of \nfollowers  and  visitors  and  increasing  hyperlinks  to  the  SASEC  website  for  more  detailed \ninformation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6: $300,000 and TASF-other sources: $600,000). The \nkey expenditure items are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \n \n9 Knowledge sharing events will be held in conjunction with the meetings of the SASEC Customs Subgroup on trade \nfacilitation; and the SASEC Power Trade Working Group on renewable energy and energy efficiency technology. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division of its South Asia Department, in close consultation with the SASEC member \ncountries. Implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  December 2020\u2013December 2023 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nImplementing agency  Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division, South Asia \nDepartment \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual: Individual  International expertise: (18 person-months)  $246,400 \nselection \n  Individual: Individual  National expertise: (32 person-months)  $215,600 \nselection \nDisbursement  Disbursement of technical assistance resources will follow ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23.
