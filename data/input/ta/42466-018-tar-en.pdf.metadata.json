THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Macroeconomic context and challenges. Bangladesh has achieved robust economic \ngrowth, averaging more than 6.0% since 2011 and recording 8.1% for FY2019. Such strong \ngrowth  has  been  driven  by  steady  expansion  and  surge  in  export-oriented  manufacturing \nindustries, such as ready-made garment, textile, leather, and food processing.1 The service sector \nis also growing, including retail, health care and tourism. Despite sustained growth during the past \ndecade, the country faces tremendous challenge in developing a skilled, competitive workforce \nthat can meet emerging skills needs in the local and global labor markets. The working-age \npopulation is expanding fast from 87 million in 2011 to 119 million by 2026, with 2 million potential \nnew entrants to the labor force every year. More than half of the labor force have only primary \neducation or less; and less than 4.0% of the working-age population (aged 15\u201359) had received \nany technical or vocational training.2 Youth unemployment rate has risen from 4.0% in 1991 to \nmore  than  10%  currently.  To  sustain  the  country\u2019s  growth  path  and  reap  the  benefit  of \ndemographic dividend, the country needs to invest in its human capital resources and develop a \nwell-trained  and  highly-skilled  workforce.  Rapid  technology  advances  are  also  affecting \nBangladesh industries, altering the nature of jobs which demand higher levels of technical and \ncognitive skills while reducing demand for low-skilled jobs.3  \n \n2.  Demand for modernizing technical education and skills development. To develop \njob-ready and demand-responsive skills among youth, modern technical education and training \nsystems are necessary. However, the capacity and quality of technical education and skills \ntraining in Bangladesh are inadequate. First, curriculum is largely theory-based and has limited \nrelevance to today\u2019s requirements in industries. Second, training facilities and equipment are too \noutdated to deliver current or emerging technical skills, and the overall capacity is insufficient to \naccommodate increasing numbers of youth to be trained. Third, the supply of qualified trainers is \nlimited, and the existing trainers have not updated their pedagogic and technical skills to adapt \ntoday\u2019s training requirements. Finally, there is lack of credible assessment and certification \nsystems to ensure the quality of training systems. Consequently, technical education, including \npolytechnics, has not led to successful employment, showing a job placement rate of less than \n50%. Female participation is also limited with only 24% of enrollment in technical and vocational \neducation and training (TVET) being female. To ensure that young men and women are equipped \nwith requisite skills in line with labor market demands, significant improvements are needed in the \nTVET system as well as the overall skills development system. Improving the TVET system is \nimportant for ensuring inclusive development, as the trainees in technical institutes are mostly \nfrom low socioeconomic backgrounds, who may not be able to pursue a higher education. \n \n3.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \nsupporting the Government of Bangladesh in its technical education and skills development \ninitiatives through the Skills Development Project (2008\u20132017) and the Skills for Employment \nInvestment  Program  (SEIP;  2014\u20132024).4 The  aim  of  these  projects  was  to  increase  the \n \n1  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nemployability and productivity of the youth entering the labor force. In particular, SEIP has: (i) \nexpanded the capacity of the country\u2019s training system by partnering with the private sector; (ii) \nimproved the relevance of training by directly aligning with industry demands; and (iii) enhanced \nthe quality of trainers and quality assurance systems. Another TA has also supported SEIP to \nimprove fiduciary management among implementing partners.5 Based on these achievements, \nthe  government  has  requested  additional  interventions  to  further  upgrade  and  modernize \ntechnical education and training systems, and to elevate the levels of skills training to meet the \nincreasing demand for advanced skills requirements. Building upon the experiences and lessons \nof the recent skills development interventions, ADB will help the government in designing strategic \ntechnical education and skills development projects catering to specific industry\u2019s demand for \nadvanced skills. \n \n4.  To ensure successful outcomes of ADB support, it is critical to enhance the capacity and \ncompetencies of executing and implementing agencies in order to ensure quality project designs, \neffective  project  implementation,  sound  financial  management,  and  overall  portfolio \nperformance.6 It is also essential to consolidate and share the lessons and good practices \ntogether with dedicated capacity building for project designs and implementation. The proposed \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) facility would bridge capability gaps, apply best practices, \nand foster innovative solutions for common challenges in the sector. The support will be provided \nthrough the provision of incremental consulting services to enhance project preparatory and \nimplementation capacity. The TA facility is aligned with ADB Strategy 2030 in addressing poverty, \nreducing inequalities, supporting gender equality, and strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity. The TA facility is listed in the country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2020\u2013\n2022, with the title Preparing Technical Education Modernization Project.7     \n \n5.  The transaction TA facility will provide project preparation support, capacity building, and \npolicy advice to two ensuing projects, comprising (i) Technical Education Modernization Project \nand (ii) Second Skills for Employment Investment Program. Both projects are in the technical \neducation and skills development subsector. The TA facility approach is suitable as it will enhance \nproject preparation efficiency and improve project implementation readiness.  In particular, the TA \nfacility will: (i) allow the pool of experts and consultants to be mobilized for due diligence activities; \n(ii) facilitate the learning of lessons in project processing and implementation across projects; (iii) \ncreate synergies among the larger pool of experts through common expertise; and (iv) strengthen \ncoordination among technical inputs and capacity building arrangement. Overall, the TA facility \nwill reduce transaction costs compared to resources required for separate stand-alone transaction \nTA projects. \n \n6.  The transaction TA facility will also provide capacity building to two ongoing projects, \ncomprising Skills for Employment Investment Program Tranche 2 and Tranche 3, as required and \nagreed with respective executing and implementing agencies. 8 Given the varying and evolving \nimplementation  capacities,  ongoing  skills  development  projects  often  face  unanticipated \nchallenges such as in the areas of procurement, financial management, and safeguards which \n \n5  ADB. 2015.

The TA is originally included as a \nstand-alone TA but is proposed to be upgraded to TA facility to support the preparation of Second Skills for \nEmployment Investment Program as well, which is included in the pipeline for 2021.  \n8  The approved Report and Recommendation of the President of the indicative ongoing projects are in Appendix 3. \n ", "3 \nrequire resources for assessments or mitigation measures. Technical and training support will be \nprovided to also ensure project sustainability and transfer of capacity and knowledge. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Improved design quality and readiness of projects achieved. Technical \nexpertise will be provided to support background studies, project design and readiness of the two \nprojects (para. 5) for potential ADB financing. The scope of activities will cover (i) analytical studies \nsuch as sector assessments, demand assessments, and stakeholder analysis as appropriate for \neach ensuing project; (ii) feasibility studies, such are conceptual technical designs, as required \nfor  ensuing  projects;  (iii)  development  of  results  frameworks  or  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframeworks; (iv) economic and financial assessments, and social, gender, and poverty analysis; \n(v) safeguard assessments including environment and social safeguards; and (vi) due diligence \nin financial management, procurement, plus other institutional arrangements for executing and \nimplementing  agencies.  The  output  will  also  support  project  readiness  through  advance \nprocurement activities for the ensuing projects.   \n \n8.  Output 2: International best practice and innovative solutions mainstreamed in \nproject design and implementation. Technical advisory and capacity building will be provided \nto executing and implementing agencies and relevant stakeholders to share international best \npractices and technology-based innovative solutions. Lessons learned from past interventions will \nalso be analyzed to inform project designs and practices. These practices will be incorporated \ninto ongoing as well as ensuing projects. The topics will cover such areas as teacher training, \nauthentic practical training, industry linkage and partnership, international twinning arrangement, \nand online open learning for technical education and skills development. Support will be provided \nthrough dialogues, workshops, and national and overseas study visits.  \n \n9.  Output  3:  Capacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  on  planning, \nimplementation and management strengthened. Technical expertise and other support will be \nprovided  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  technical \neducation and skills development projects for successful implementation and sustainability. \nSupport will be provided for critical areas, such as planning for modern technical education, \nsetting up quality training facilities, specifications of quality training equipment, establishment of \neffective monitoring and evaluation systems, ensuring financial management and procurement \ncapacity for timely implementation and sustainability, gender mainstreaming, and safeguards. \nAlong with expert advice, seminars or workshops will be offered across multiple projects.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1. The TA facility scope is expected to expand to cover other additional \nactivities, consistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and activities, and be replenished from time to time as \nrequired and additional funds are available.  \n \n11.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, workshop facilities, office supplies, secretarial and coordination assistance, and other in-\nkind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance ensuing projects. \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The Finance Division in the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency of the TA \nfacility. ADB, through the South Asia Human and Social Development Division (SAHS), will \nadminister the TA facility and will work closely with the executing and implementing departments \nfor the ongoing and planned projects. ADB will be responsible for the recruitment, management, \nand administration of all consultants financed by the TA facility. ADB will inform the relevant \ngovernment agencies of selected consultants prior to their mobilization.  \n \n13.  The  TA  facility  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  from  June  2020  to  June  2023. \nDisbursement under the TA facility will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table below. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  June 2020\u2013June 2023 \nExecuting agency  Finance Division, Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agencies  Finance Division, Ministry of Finance; Directorate of Technical Education, \nMinistry of Education \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB.  \n  Individual: ICS   14 person-months  $229,790 \n(international) \n  Individual: ICS  31 person-months  $147,950 \n(national) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultation selection, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n15.  Consulting services. The TA facility will initially provide 45 person-months\u2019 consultant \ninputs (14 person-months international and 31 person-months national) to support the preparation \nof ensuing projects and implementation of ongoing projects. The consultants will be recruited \nusing individual consultant selection method and deployed based on the requirements of each \nproject being prepared or implemented. Individual consultant selection, rather than firm selection, \nis  considered  appropriate,  because  the  TA  facility  involves  multiple  activities  that  are  not \nnecessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of consultants and services. ADB will \nengage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.9  \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Bangladesh for Supporting Technical Education and Skills Development Facility \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n9  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
