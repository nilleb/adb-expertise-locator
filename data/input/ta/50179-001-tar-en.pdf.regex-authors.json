INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) supports the Government of the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) to (i) improve investment policy; and (ii) promote business \ninnovation, workplace skills development, and employment facilitation. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) conducted a fact-finding mission on 16\u201317 February 2017, and obtained government \nconcurrence on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants.1 Previous consultations on the TA were \nheld in September and November 2016. The September 2016 mission included a presentation \non ADB\u2019s workplace skills and employment facilitation projects implemented in the Philippines. \nThe TA is included in the Lao PDR country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019.2 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Development challenges. The Lao PDR experienced robust economic growth during \n2011\u20132015, averaging 7.6% of gross domestic product annually. The resource sector in the Lao \nPDR is a key growth driver, with large-scale foreign direct investments in hydropower and mining \naccounting for one-third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. However, the mining sector \naccounts for only 0.5% of total employment.4 With half of the population under the age of 24 and \nalmost 100,000 new job seekers entering the labor market each year, there is strong pressure to \ncreate  wage  employment  in  the  non-resource sectors, such  as  tourism,  agribusiness,  and \nbusiness services. The government recognizes that the target to implement the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community consolidated strategic action plan by \n2025 is a potential catalyst for growth in the non-resource sectors and domestic job creation. Also, \nthe government recognizes that, to benefit from trade in goods and services, it needs to create a \npolicy environment to attract investments, boost enterprise productivity, and facilitate youth \nemployment. \n \n3.  Binding constraints. The ability of enterprises to raise productivity is constrained by an \ninadequate investment policy framework and lack of market-based incentives for enterprises to \ninnovate and invest in workplace skills training. Existing labor market programs are not equipped \nto respond to employer hiring needs, resulting in difficulties for young people to find jobs after \ngraduating from high school. For example, the 2009 Investment Promotion Law5 established an \nincentive  framework  that  has  had  the  unintended  consequence  of  attracting  short-term \ninvestments  based  on  generous  income  tax  incentives  rather  than  attracting  longer-term \nemployment-generating investments in the non-resource sector. A complex investment licensing \nand regulatory environment has also suppressed investments in the non-resource sector. At the \nend of 2016, the government submitted amendments to the Investment Promotion Law to rectify \ndeficiencies in incentives and the licensing regime; these amendments, once approved, will be \nimplemented by the government in 2017\u20132018. One of the key amendments will establish a one-\nstop investment licensing service center to make it easier for foreign and domestic investors to \nestablish operations in the Lao PDR. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 February 2017. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Domestic enterprises are characterized by low productivity levels as a result of not \ninvesting adequately in basic innovative activities and workplace skills.6 For example, a 2014 \nenterprise survey reported that only 8% of respondents invested in short-term skills training.7 \nGlobal good practices show that publicly funded schemes to promote enterprise innovation and \ninvestments  in  workplace  skills  can  be  catalysts  for  improving  enterprise  productivity  and \nadaptability to changes in markets. In the Lao PDR, there are no public funding schemes \nincentivizing enterprises to innovate and invest in workplace skills. \n \n5.  Active labor market programs are critical to help young people prepare for the labor market \nand help employers find the right employees. Public employment service centers (PESCs) are \nplatforms for implementing active labor market programs and facilitating job placements. In the \nLao PDR, there are 10 PESCs located in the country\u2019s main urban centers that provide only basic, \nlow-level employment facilitation services such as posting job vacancies and employer referrals. \nADB is providing TA to the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare to establish labor market \ninformation systems and build capacity of the 10 PESCs.8 International best practice shows that \nit is critical for the PESCs to also implement youth employment programs that: (i) are employer \ndemand-driven; and (ii) provide an integrated set of services to youth such as career guidance, \nlife  skills  training,  industry-specific  technical  training,  and  placements  or  internships  with \nemployers.9 \n \n6.  Government\u2019s strategy. The government\u2019s approach to addressing these constraints is \narticulated in the government\u2019s Eighth Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan, \n2016\u20132020,10 and can be categorized into three policy areas: (i) creating an enabling business \nenvironment;  (ii)  promoting  investments  in  business  innovations  and  workforce  skills \ndevelopment; and (iii) implementing employment facilitation programs. Under the first area, the \ngovernment has: (i) implemented a competition policy since 2015; (ii) enacted legislation that \nmandates regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) across government; (iii) implemented a modern \nenterprise registration system; and (iv) implemented a credit information bureau and a secured \ntransaction registry. These interventions have improved the Lao PDR\u2019s business climate. The \nWorld Bank\u2019s 2017 Doing Business report shows the Lao PDR has improved significantly in the \nareas of obtaining a business permit (ranked 139th in 2017 from 150th in 2010) and getting credit \n(ranked 75th in 2017 from 89th in 2010). With these foundational reforms in place, the government \nis looking at ways to strengthen its innovation policy and intellectual property rights protection, \nand develop an incentives framework to encourage business innovations and short-term skills \ntraining. Under employment facilitation, the government\u2019s strategy is to improve the capacity of \nPESCs, establish a labor market information system, and design and implement active labor \nmarket programs to support youth as they prepare to enter the labor market. \n \n7.  ADB experience. ADB has supported the government\u2019s private sector development \nagenda including the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through loan \nprograms, investment project loans, a series of TA grants, and knowledge products. The Private \nSector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program loans, 2008\u20132013, \nsupported the government\u2019s  implementation  of foundational reforms for  SME  development, \n                                                \n6  Science and Technology Policy Institute, Republic of Korea. 2014.

", "3 \nincluding a modern enterprise registry,11 RIAs, the credit information bureau, and trade reforms \nfor the benefit of SMEs.12 An ongoing capacity development TA loan and a TA grant have \nsupported  the  government\u2019s  RIA  implementation,13 enhanced  the  enterprise  registry,  and \nestablished an innovative e-trading platform for SMEs linked with key Southeast Asian chambers \nof commerce (footnote 12). This capacity development TA complements this previous assistance \nby expanding ADB engagement to develop policy frameworks and pilot interventions on public \nfunding for innovation and skills training at the enterprise level.14 This capacity development TA \nalso extends this previous assistance to help young people prepare for the job market.15 Lessons \nlearned from the TA activities will be used to formulate a sector development program loan in \n2019.  \n \n8.  Risks. Identified risks include a change in government leadership resulting in shift in \npriorities, which may prevent the incorporation of recommendations in policy decisions. This will \nbe mitigated through frequent engagement with government stakeholders to firmly integrate the \nTA outputs in the policy decision-making process across different ministries. Another identified \nrisk is possible duplication among donors on topics related to the TA. To mitigate this risk, donor \ncoordination efforts will continue during TA implementation. \n \n9.  Lessons applied and donor coordination. ADB\u2019s experience provided the following four \nlessons, which were incorporated into the TA: \n(i)  There is a need to bring business innovation, workplace skills development, and \nemployment facilitation under one policy framework to link businesses and the \nlabor market; \n(ii)  Successful ADB programs, projects, and TA projects work with a small number of \nimplementing agencies with established sector-based strategies and proven track \nrecords in reaching out to stakeholders for input and ownership; \n(iii)  Policy reforms and interventions need to be in sequence. ADB\u2019s assistance, from \n2011, focused on an enabling business environment, while interventions are now \nneeded to improve enterprise productivity so that they benefit from the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community; and \n(iv)  For ADB\u2019s policy assistance to be sustainable, local economists and researchers \nshould contribute their perspective and expertise on locally suitable policies and \ninitiatives. Thus, the TA supports the development of a pool of local experts and \nresearchers who can contribute to policy development. \n \n10.  ADB  will  continue  to  coordinate  with  other  donors  such  as  German  development \ncooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, the International \n                                                \n11 The modern enterprise registry was launched in 2008 and subsequently upgraded with ADB assistance. The number \nof enterprises formally registered increased from 40,000 enterprises in 2008 to 124,000 by 2015. \n12 ADB. 2009.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be the achievement of inclusive economic growth and employment \ngeneration, in line with the Eighth Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020.16 The outcome will be strengthened economic policy formulation and implementation \nprocesses. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA has four outputs (paras. 11\u201314). Indicators and performance targets in relation to \nthe four outputs are in Appendix 1. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Investment  policy  framework  improved.  This  output  will  support  the \nenhancement of investment policy development and implementation of the amended Investment \nPromotion  Law  to  increase  economic  activity  in  non-resource  sectors  by:  (i)  conducting  a \nstocktaking of existing investment policies and incentives; (ii) identifying lessons learned and new \nglobal practices in promoting domestic and foreign investment applicable to the Lao PDR context; \n(iii) developing suggestions for policy incentives for promoting investments in priority sectors; and \n(iv) supporting the implementation of key provisions of the revised Investment Promotion Law \nsuch as the establishment of a one-stop business registration center. \n \n14.  Output 2: Innovation and workplace skills development policy framework improved. \nThis output will support policy advisory and capacity development for improving enterprise \ninnovation  and  workplace  skills.  Activities  will  include:  (i)  conducting  a  stocktaking  of  and \nidentifying lessons learned from existing workplace skills policies; (ii) conducting a stocktaking of \nand identifying lessons learned from existing innovation policy, including intellectual property \nrights;  (iii)  identifying  global  best  practices  for  promoting  innovation  and  workplace  skills \ndevelopment applicable in the Lao PDR context; (iv) making recommendations on policies, \nprograms, and public financing schemes for promoting innovative activities at the enterprise level; \nand (v) making recommendations on policies, programs, and public financing schemes for \npromoting employer-led skills development in the workplace in priority growth sectors. \n \n15.  Output 3: Employment facilitation programs developed. This output will facilitate labor \nmarket activation programs to help young people become job ready, find jobs, and address skills \nmismatches. It will focus on key groups of job seekers such as out-of-school youth, workers who \nrequire retraining, and other vulnerable labor groups. Activities will include: (i) conducting a \nstocktaking of and identifying lessons learned from existing employment policies and programs; \n(ii) carrying out a youth school-to-work transition survey and a skills and employment survey to \nprovide input for a joint ADB\u2013Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \npublication on employment and skills mismatch;17 and (iii) making recommendations for pilot \nprojects on labor market activation programs that provide integrated comprehensive employment \nservices to youth. This output will draw on ADB\u2019s experience in implementing labor market \nactivation programs in the Philippines (footnote 15).  \n                                                \n16 Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2016.

", "5 \n16.  Output 4: Linkages with centers of excellence established. With the aim of enhancing \nthe pool of policy research expertise, this output will support policy research for priority topics \nidentified by the government as well as capacity development of local think tanks. Two major \nactivities will be undertaken as part of this output: (i) provision of research grants to Lao \nresearchers in priority topics identified by government agencies; and (ii) capacity building for local \nthink tanks through training on research methodology, data analysis, and software, as well as on-\nthe-job training with international research mentors. Partners under this activity include the \nNational University of Laos, National Economic Research Institute, and the Development Policy \nResearch Center of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund 6. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, remuneration, \ndomestic transportation of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The executing agency is the MPI. It will chair the TA steering committee, with implementing \nagencies and other relevant stakeholders as members. The committee will meet biannually to \nreport on and discuss TA outputs. The implementing agencies are the Department of Investment \nPromotion of the MPI (output 1), the Ministry of Science and Technology (output 2), the Ministry \nof Labor and Social Welfare (outputs 2 and 3), and the Ministry of Finance (output 4).  \n \n19.  The Ministry of Finance will establish and chair a research awards committee with \nparticipation from implementing agencies and ADB to identify research topics and select research \ngrantees through a competitive process. Under output 4, 10 research grantees will be awarded \nresearch grants of up to a total amount of $35,000. Each researcher will be engaged as a resource \nperson through ADB\u2019s consultant management system. The guidelines for selecting grantees will \nbe developed during the TA implementation stage. Individual consultants will be engaged to \nimplement the TA activities. A national firm will be engaged for the employment survey listed in \nOutput 3. Details of consultant recruitment are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Upon TA completion, all \nequipment purchased under the TA will be handed over to the executing agency in accordance \nwith relevant ADB guidelines. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 36 months from May 2017 to April 2020 \nfollowing the signing  of  the TA  agreement  between  the government and  ADB.  Consultant \ndeliverables are in the outline terms of reference for consultants in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Economic Policy Support for \nEnhancing Productivity and Employment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nInclusive economic growth and employment generation achieved (Eighth Five-Year National Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan, 2016\u20132020)a \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Risks \nwith Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nOutcome  By 2021    Change in government \nEconomic policy      ministry leadership \nformulation and  a.
