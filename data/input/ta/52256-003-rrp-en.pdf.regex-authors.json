THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed small \nexpenditure financing facility (SEFF) to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Multisector Activities Support \nFacility. The facility will finance a series of small-value activities to support and complement larger \nprojects financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the country. \n \n2.  In particular, the facility will fund (i) project preparatory support for design and procurement \nreadiness  of  ensuing  projects;  (ii)  small  pilot  projects  to  demonstrate  new  technologies, \ninternational  standards,  and management  approaches for  potential  scale-up  under  ensuing \nprojects; (iii) project implementation support for ongoing ADB projects to ensure the efficient \ndelivery of project outcomes; and (iv) capacity building and supplemental support for completed \nADB projects in operation and maintenance (O&M), asset management, facility upgrading to meet \ncritical needs, and post-disaster rehabilitation assistance. The first activity to be financed under \nthe facility will enhance the sustainability of a completed ADB-financed investment in urban water \nproject. \n \nII.  THE FACILITY \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  Country portfolio overview. Despite ADB\u2019s assistance portfolio in the Kyrgyz Republic \ntripling from 2000 to 2018, capacity constraints remain in the country, resulting in project start-up \ndelays that affect contract awards and disbursement rates. Other challenges include inadequate \ndesigns and cost overruns. \n \n4.  Project sustainability risks. Key factors leading to sustainability risks in ADB\u2019s project \nportfolio include (i) low tariffs (below intended O&M cost recovery levels), (ii) weak operational \nefficiency through traditional technologies, (iii) weak O&M capacity, and (iv) limited resources and \nknowledge of asset management. Moreover, there is an immediate need to support upgrades to \ncompleted water supply infrastructure to meet updated standards. \n \n5.  Strategic context. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS), 2018\u20132022 for the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,1 which is aligned with government priority sectors under the Development Program of \nthe Kyrgyz Republic,2 prioritizes support for minimizing project start-up delays, and improving \nprocurement  and  project  implementation  capacity  through  technical  assistance  and  on-the-\nground support from ADB\u2019s resident mission. In line with the CPS, the SEFF will support the \ngovernment\u2019s strategic priorities. The proposed assistance under the facility is also aligned with \nthe Strategy 2030 operational priorities to (i) address remaining poverty and reduce inequalities, \n(ii) accelerate progress in gender equality, (iii) make cities more livable, (iv) tackle climate change \nand enhance environmental sustainability, (v) promote rural development and food security, (vi) \nstrengthen  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  (vii)  foster  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.3 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

The SEFF will deliver on CPS priorities by \n(i) supporting early design work and advanced procurement actions to alleviate project start-up \nbottlenecks; (ii) strengthening the government\u2019s project implementation capacity; (iii) introducing \nnew technologies, standards, and management approaches; (iv) enhancing the sustainability of \nADB-financed investments through improved asset management and O&M practices; and (v) \nbringing  completed  infrastructure  investments  in  conformance  with  up-to-date  performance \nstandards. \n \nB.  Facility Description \n \n7.  Objective.  Activities  under  the  facility  will  improve  the  efficiency,  sustainability, \nresponsiveness,  and  readiness  of  ADB-financed  operations.  They  will  contribute  to  the \nachievement of the outputs and outcomes of the linked ADB-financed projects. \n \n8.  Facility scope. The facility will finance a series of small-scale activities related to one or \nmore of the outputs (para. 9).4 Each activity will be linked to a planned, ongoing, or completed \nADB-financed project. Under the current CPS, priority sectors are agriculture, natural resources, \nand rural development; education; energy; public sector management; transport; and water and \nother urban infrastructure and services. \n \n9.  The following outputs will contribute to the achievement of the outputs and outcomes of \nthe linked ADB-financed projects.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Project implementation readiness for ensuing projects improved. The \nfacility  will  support  project  preparation,  design  activities,  and  institutional  strengthening  for \ninvestments to be financed under one or more ensuing ADB-financed projects, including the \nNaryn Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Development Program\u2014the country\u2019s first results-\nbased lending operation\u2014planned for 2019 approval.5  \n \n11.  Output 2: New technology, innovation, or improvement in design standards pilot-\ntested. The facility will support pilot-testing advanced technologies and management approaches \nto  reduce  life-cycle  costs,  improve  service  efficiency  and  quality,  and  minimize  negative \nenvironmental and social impacts. Development of road asset management is an example of a \nnew technology or management approaches activity under the facility. \n \n12.  Output 3: Project efficiency and sustainability enhanced. The facility will enhance \nproject efficiency and sustainability, including capacity and implementation support for ongoing \nprojects,  post-disaster  rehabilitation,  O&M,  and  upgrading  of  completed  infrastructure \ninvestments to conform with up-to-date performance standards. The first activity under this output \nis the Osh\u2013Plotina water treatment plant (WTP) chlorine neutralization unit. \n \nC.  Scope of First Activity \n \n13.  The first activity under the facility will support the physical upgrades of the chlorine \nneutralization unit at the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP, completed in September 2016 under  the Emergency \nAssistance for Recovery and Reconstruction project.6 The unit will be upgraded to a higher \n                                                \n4  List of Indicative Activities (accessible from the list of linked documents in the Appendix). \n5  ADB.

A key objective of the project approved in September 2010 was to rebuild dwellings and \nimprove the essential public infrastructure, and a project subcomponent included the rehabilitation \nof the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP. The project completion report concluded that the project was successful, \nbut noted that upgrading the chlorine neutralization unit at the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP to meet up-to-\ndate water supply standards with the highest safety levels remains a priority.7 Given its urgency, \nthe government requested the chlorine neutralization unit upgrade at the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP as \nthe first activity under the facility. The upgraded chlorine neutralization unit will ensure enhanced \nneutralization of any chlorine leakage, which is essential to the safe and sustainable operations \nof the WTP. The activity will enhance ADB\u2019s development impact at an overall cost of $625,000.8 \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n15.  The government has requested a facility in an amount up to $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFund resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the activities. The facility amount \nincludes the total estimated cost of activities to be financed, including taxes and duties, physical \nand price contingencies, and other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \nAmounta  Share \nItem  ($ million)  (%) \nA.

The government has \nrequested a subgrant of $500,000 under the facility to help finance this activity. The ADB subgrant \nwill finance civil works and the audit of activity financial statements, while the government will \nfinance taxes and duties, and project management office operational costs. \n \n17.  The following types of expenditure will be eligible for financing under the facility: consulting \nservices, non-consulting services, small works, and goods. \n \n18.

The executing agency for all activities to be financed under the facility will be the Ministry \nof Finance, which has been involved in several previous ADB operations.  \n \n20.  The implementing agency for the first activity\u2014the Department of Drinking Water Supply \nand Sewerage Development under the State Agency for Water Resources\u2014will be responsible \nfor overall activity coordination and management. The agency is responsible for issuing state \ntechnical expertise certificates for all technical projects and is fully aware of the implemented \nactions  done  under  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Recovery  and  Reconstruction  project. \nImplementing agencies for subsequent facility activities will be determined based on the nature \nof the activities to be supported under the facility. \n \n21.  Implementation arrangements of the facility, including specific arrangements for the first \nactivity, are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the activity administration manual.9 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nSEFF availability period  October 2019\u2013October 2024 \nEstimated completion date for the  December 2020 \nfirst activity \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency for the  Ministry of Finance \nSEFF \n(ii)  Implementing agencies for the  First activity: DDWSSD; subsequent activities: to be determined \nSEFF activities  based on the nature and scope of the activity to be supported \nunder the SEFF \n                                                \n9  Activity Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix). \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(iii)  Implementation units for the  To be determined for each activity subgrant. For the first activity, \nSEFF activities  the implementing agency will establish a project management \noffice comprising 5 staff to support implementation. \nProcurement  The first activity will include 1 works contract for $0.50 million. \nEach activity under the facility will have an associated \nprocurement plan. All procurement financed under the facility \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and Procurement Regulations (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). \nAdvance contracting  To ensure procurement readiness, all individual activities to be \nsupported by the facility are anticipated to undertake advance \ncontracting. The first activity subgrant will initiate procurement \nin the third quarter of 2019. \nDisbursement  Disbursement of subgrant proceeds for all activities will follow \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DDWSSD = Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development, \nSEFF = small expenditure financing facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n22.  Economic and financial analysis will be carried out, as appropriate, for each activity \nfinanced under the facility to confirm that the larger ADB-financed project that is being supported \nby the activity will remain viable. As described in para. 12, the first activity will enhance the \ntreatment performance of the chlorine neutralization unit at the Osh\u2013Plotina WTP. The water tariff \nlevied by Vodokanal, the city\u2019s water utility, can sufficiently cover O&M costs. \n \n23.  The economic analysis for the completed project was updated to take into account the \nadditional costs associated with the subgrant for the first activity. The analysis showed that the \noverall project will remain viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 18.7% compared with \nthe 19.1% reflected on the project completion report and a financial internal rate of return of 2.4% \ncompared with the initial estimate of 2.8%, as the outputs have not changed, and the increase in \ncapital expenses is negligible in relation to the size of the linked project. \n \n24.  For subsequent activities, economic and financial analysis will be updated as appropriate, \ntaking into account activity subgrants for the concerned projects. \n \n25.  The Ministry of Finance and ADB will agree on all activities to be financed under the facility, \ntaking into consideration that (i) activities should be consistent with the CPS and the facility \noutputs, (ii) activities would not be classified category A for safeguards in line with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and (iii) the maximum activity size will not exceed $3 million. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  The  financial  management  risk  for  the  implementing  agency  for  the  first  activity  is \nsubstantial.  Mitigating  measures  have  been  incorporated  under  the  approved  Issyk-Kul \nWastewater Management Project that will ensure that the Department of Drinking Water Supply \nand Sewerage Development has (i) adequate staff to handle project financial management, \n ", "6 \nalthough they are unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s disbursement guidelines and procedures; (ii) an adequate \naccounting system that integrates project-specific accounting, budgeting, auditing, and reporting \nrequirements; on top of (iii) the experience as an executing agency for projects financed by other \ninternational financial institutions, with responsibilities for grant disbursements and advance \naccount management; and (iv) capacity for internal audit.  \n \n27.  For subsequent activities, a financial management assessment will be undertaken for the \ndesignated implementing agencies. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the activity administration manual (footnote 9). All \nactivity subgrants under the facility will include integrity due diligence.10 \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n29.  All activity subgrants under the facility will include activity-specific safeguard review and \ncategorization. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the safeguard categories \nof the first activity subgrant are indicated below.11 The facility will not support category A projects. \n \n30.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared for the facility following the Safeguard Policy Statement to guide the preparation of \nenvironmental assessment reports. The first activity covering the chlorine neutralization unit at \nthe Osh\u2013Plotina WTP is category B for the environment, and initial environmental examination \nwas prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). A land acquisition and resettlement framework \nhas been prepared for the facility\u2019s subsequent activities following the Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe resettlement classification for the first activity is category C as no land acquisition and \ninvoluntarily resettlement is envisaged. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The first activity and all subsequent activities will not \nimpact communities that may be defined as indigenous peoples under the Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The indigenous peoples' impact classification for the subgrant is category C. \n \nD.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n33.  The overall risk for the facility is low because of the nature and limited size of the activities \nto be supported. Significant risks and mitigating measures for the first activity are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.12 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nPolitical and/or organizational.  Close government agency coordination will be maintained to \nGovernment approval procedures by  minimize delays in procurement and approvals. \n                                                \n10 No project performance audit report has been undertaken for the Kyrgyz Republic. \n11 ADB.

ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of activities under the facility shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards,  procurement,  consulting  services,  financial  management,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the facility agreement. \n \n35.  The government and the Ministry of Finance have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the facility and the first activity, which are set forth in the draft facility agreement and short-\nform legal agreement for the first activity. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed small expenditure financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove  the  small  expenditure financing facility  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic for the  Multisector \nActivities Support Facility in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $10,000,000, which \ncomprises the provision of grants from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund), on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft facility agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n21 August 2019  \n ", "8  Appendix \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/LinkedDocs/?id=52256-003-PRF \n \n1.
