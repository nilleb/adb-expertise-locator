INTRODUCTION \n1.  Natural disasters place a substantial financial burden on developing member country \n(DMC) governments and contribute to fiscal and economic volatility. Dealing with natural hazard \nrisk requires attention at several levels: from frequent disasters of limited reach to rare events of \ncatastrophic  proportions,  from  general  economic  considerations  to  specific  project-level \napplications, from insurance and risk transfer to disaster response and contingency planning, \nand from remote rural areas and small island nations to densely populated urban centers. The \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provides a \ngeneral framework through which ADB can help DMCs to reduce disaster risk. To understand \nthe complexity of disaster risk management in the Asia and Pacific region and to identify ways \nto assist DMCs, ADB undertook in 2006 a regional technical assistance (TA) on catastrophe risk \ninsurance mechanisms.2 The final report recommended holding a workshop to exchange ideas \nand explore the prospects for an Asian insurance pool.  \n \n2.  The Ministry of Finance of Japan met with ADB in October 2007 to follow up on the \nrecommendations of the TA on Development of Catastrophe Risk Insurance Mechanisms. Since \nADB\u2019s Pacific Department was embarking on a support program3 for a World Bank initiative to \ndevelop a catastrophe risk insurance scheme requested by Pacific island governments, this \ncomponent was included in the discussions and subsequent developments. A working party \ncomprising ADB and Government of Japan officials developed a conference and workshop \nprogram exploring a series of issues pertaining to the operation of risk pooling facilities and \nissues relating to megacities and the Pacific.4 The TA is consistent with pillar 4 of ADB\u2019s \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  strategy.5 The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Disaster risk management in the Asia and Pacific region has been largely neglected. A \n2005 source estimated that about $40 billion, or 1% of the entire Asia and Pacific region\u2019s gross \nnational  income  of  $4  trillion,  would  be  required  to  put  needed  disaster  management \ninfrastructure in place.6 An additional $15 billion is typically required annually to restore the \ninfrastructure and economic momentum of countries in the region that are hit by disasters. This \ncost could be significantly reduced through the implementation of appropriate measures to \nreduce disaster risk. However, recent reports find that the types of activities best able to reduce \nvulnerability\u2014such  as  developing  or  revising  building  codes,  developing  risk  management \ninstitutions, and developing insurance and other mechanisms for spreading risk\u2014are precisely \nthe activities for which member countries are least likely to borrow.7 \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Over the past 2 decades, deaths from disasters annually have fallen 30% despite the \nnumber of people whose assets are affected by disasters increasing by 59%.8 Moreover, the \nnumber of recorded disasters is rising annually, reaching in 2007 an all-time high of 950.9 The \nrise in the number of people whose assets are affected appears to be caused by three main \nfactors: (i) climate change, which produces more extreme meteorological events; (ii) increased \nurbanization, which is poorly regulated; and (iii) the complexity of the development process itself, \nwhich tends to increase vulnerability to disaster.10 \n \n5.  Natural disasters increasingly harm the most vulnerable people in the Asia and Pacific \nregion. The diverse, unstable geophysical characteristics and harsh climates of the Asia and \nPacific region make it especially vulnerable to natural disasters, and development gains are \nfragile and easily overwhelmed by their effects. In the 30 years from 1975 to 2005, Asia \naccounted for 37% of the world\u2019s recorded natural disasters, 57% of deaths, 89% of people \naffected, and 44% of property and infrastructure damage. \n \n6.  The Asia and Pacific region contains some of the world\u2019s fastest growing and densest \nurban concentrations. The United Nations projects that, by 2030, 55% of some 4.9 billion Asians \n(or 2.7 billion people) will live in urban areas.11 Ten percent of this population is expected to live \nin 12 megacities of more than 10 million inhabitants, and many more will live in conurbations \nsuch as Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Guangdong, which could have 120 million people by 2010.12 \nUrbanization and the rise of megacities fundamentally reshape the risk landscape. Decisive \nfactors for a city\u2019s exposure to natural disaster are its geographical location and the total area \ncovered. In the case of Asia, the potential for disaster is compounded by a lack of urban \nplanning,  which  is  a  significant  determinant  of  resistance  or  vulnerability.  Because  of  the \ndominance of megacities in Asia, many of which serve global functions, natural disasters have \nthe potential to disrupt entire regions. \n \n7.  Pacific island countries rank among the world\u2019s most vulnerable to natural disasters and \nface  a  more  extreme  challenge  than  their  larger  Asian  neighbors.  The  concentration  of \nproductive capacity in relatively small areas that are becoming increasingly vulnerable to rising \nsea levels and an apparent intensification of hydro-meteorological events elevate the risks \nfaced.13 A  combination  of  reliance  upon  development  partners  for  support  in  response  to \ndisasters and competing short-term priorities have also limited the adoption of disaster risk \nmanagement actions.14 The intensity of extreme events is expected to increase with climate \nchange.  Unless  urgent  measures  to  manage  disaster  risk  are  undertaken,  Pacific  island \ncountries\u2019 coping capacity could be increasingly compromised.  \n \n                                                 \n8  Data derived from the disaster events database, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research on \nthe Epidemiology of Disasters.

One consistent shortcoming in the risk management strategies of developing countries \nhas  been  the  lack  of  planning  and  financial  protection  against  disasters.  Traditionally, \ndeveloping  countries  have  relied  on  their  own  limited  financial  resources  and  international \nassistance to cover their disaster losses. This resource application for reconstruction financing \nplaces  a  strain  on  the  ability  of  the  countries  to  fund  longer-term  economic  and  social \ndevelopment programs. This problem has been overcome in developed countries in part by \ndeveloping ex ante financing tools (insurance being an example) that provide needed post-\ndisaster reconstruction funding. Developing countries either have not prioritized such investment \nin future financial stability or have been unable to afford participation in this market.  \n \n9.  Country or state level catastrophe risk pooling has been available for several decades in \ndeveloped nations.15 The New Zealand Earthquake Commission and Japan\u2019s Government-\ncreated Japanese Earthquake Reinsurance are examples. Catastrophe risk pooling is a more \nrecent initiative in transitional and developing economies and has typically been a response to \nrecent  catastrophic  events.  The  Turkish  Catastrophe  Insurance  Pool  and  compulsory \nearthquake  insurance  scheme  provide  coverage  for  all  residential  buildings  that  fall  within \nmunicipal  boundaries. 16  The  Taiwan  Residential  Earthquake  Insurance  Program  (2002) \nprovides replacement coverage on all earthquake losses. In Indonesia, the Government took an \ninitiative in 2003 to promote insurance coverage for natural disasters by requiring all licensed \ngeneral insurance and reinsurance operators in Indonesia to cooperate in insuring special risks \nthrough a joint undertaking of all companies known as the Indonesian Reinsurance Pool. The \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  is  currently  considering  a  general  concept  for  establishing  an \nearthquake insurance pool, probably based on some form of public-private partnership among \ninsurers, reinsurers, and government.  \n \n10.  Regional pooling mechanisms are rarer and more recent. The first is the Caribbean \nCatastrophe  Risk  Insurance  Facility  (CCRIF),  which  became  operational  on  1  June  2007 \nfollowing a series of natural disasters in the region in 2004. It uses a parametric model and \nprovides 16 participating governments from the Caribbean with immediate liquidity if one of \nthem is hit by a hurricane or earthquake of a specified intensity or greater.17 CCRIF acts as a \nrisk aggregator by allowing participating countries to pool their country-specific risks into one, \nbetter-diversified portfolio. There is no cross-subsidization because each government\u2019s premium \nis directly related to each country\u2019s specific risk profile. Initial risk capital provided by donors,18 \nincluding the World Bank, allows CCRIF to retain a portion of the risk through its own reserves, \nthereby reducing the cost of premiums and dependency on reinsurance.  \n \n11.  Despite  the  high  cost  of  disasters,  risk  transfer  and  other  ex  ante  risk  financing \nmechanisms remain the least explored or adopted options in the Asia and Pacific region, mainly \nbecause of such shortcomings as poor regulatory environments, poor data, limited technology \ntransfer, and a general lack of insurance awareness. A clear information gap exists in the \nunderstanding of key officials in the most vulnerable DMCs of such catastrophic risk insurance \n                                                 \n15 Sector-specific insurance, such as crop insurance, is more commonplace. See, for example, FAO. 2005. Insurance \nof Crops in Developing Countries. Food and Agriculture Organization Agricultural Services Bulletin #159. Rome: \nFood and Agriculture Organization. United Nations. \n16 In particular, the obligation to extend credit and construct dwellings for the public in the event of an earthquake. \n17 Parameters for coverage are determined prior to impact and are triggered automatically after occurrence and the \nseverity has been confirmed by an independent authority, like the US Geological Survey (for earthquakes). \n18 Rather than subsidizing premiums, which might need to be done in perpetuity, donating to risk capital allows the \nfacility to become independent after a period of years. Donors\u2019 financial contributions to the reserves help all \nparticipating countries by reducing the amount of reinsurance that needs to be purchased. As reserves increase, \nthe pool will become increasingly resilient and less dependent on reinsurance, with a consequent reduction in \npremium costs. \n ", "4   \nschemes and their potential to alleviate the economic impacts of natural disasters. An increased \ngovernment awareness of catastrophe insurance options brings with it the added benefits of \nsensitizing governments to the practice of risk management and the use of systematic hazard \nassessment,  and  it  also  demands  that  finance  ministries  become  involved  in  considering \nstrategies to manage disaster risk. Furthermore, insurance industry players have not yet started \nto focus on the potential markets created by a pool of DMCs, preferring instead to focus on \nsingle markets in specific countries and cities. Development partners are now factoring risk \nmanagement into country strategies, and risk transfer has shown up as a major consideration. \nBringing key parties together to discuss, evaluate, and collate information on existing pool \noptions  can  assist  in  catalyzing  the  conditions  needed  for  the  take  off  of  regional  and/or \nsubregional catastrophe insurance. \n \n12.  While the availability of insurance for natural hazards depends on a range of factors in \nthe world insurance market, there is no evidence of a shortfall in the amount of catastrophe \nreinsurance capacity available for DMCs. Reinsurers and global insurers have been covering \nDMC risks selectively for many years, and reinsurers are already expanding their activity in \nDMCs  where  economic  growth  can  generate  meaningful  profits  as  well  as  allow  risk \ndiversification.  Nonetheless,  the  volatility  of  reinsurance  pricing  is  such  that  developing \ncountries often find themselves unable to participate unless the early stages of a catastrophe \npooling arrangement can benefit from stable, low-cost backing provided by institutions such as \nmultilateral development banks (footnote 12). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  impact  of  this  TA  will  be  the  strengthened  financial  resilience  of  participating \nmember  nations  against  the  economic  effects  of  selected  natural  disasters.  The  expected \noutcome is the development of a consensus on forward action by governmental, private sector, \nand development partners to implement conference and workshop conclusions concerning the \npooling of DMC risk in catastrophe insurance schemes, which could lead to the development of \nan ADB action plan for catastrophe insurance. Key outputs will be a conference and two \nworkshops and a publication comprising technical papers. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA has three key activities: \n(i)  preparation of preconference technical papers by internationally acknowledged \nspecialists outlining major issues, recent developments, and considerations in \nmoving forward (see Appendix 2 for the technical papers titles); \n(ii)  organization and arrangements for an international conference on catastrophe \ninsurance for 250\u2013300 participants to be held in Tokyo in November 2008 and for \ntwo workshops focused on catastrophe insurance for (a) Asian megacities and \n(b) the Pacific, to be held simultaneously the day after the conference; and \n(iii)  production of a report comprising a compilation of key papers, deliberations on \nkey  issues  identified  during  conference  and  workshop  deliberations,  and \nrecommendations for future action, to be placed on the ADB website.  \n \n15.  Participants in the conference and workshops will be officials from selected DMCs, \nselected  development  partners,  multilateral  development  banks,  regional  insurers  and \nreinsurers, catastrophe pool operators, and insurance brokers. Participation at the conference \n ", "  5\nand associated workshops will be by invitation. The draft program for the conference and \nworkshops and expected preconference technical paper titles is in Appendix 2.  \n \n16.  The selection of participating countries for the Pacific workshop will be undertaken by \nthe Pacific Department in consultation with the World Bank. The World Bank will be a partner in \nthis workshop and provide at least two resource persons. For the megacities workshop, the \ncriteria will be Asian megacities (i.e., discrete urban areas with resident populations of more \nthan 10 million) prone to earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons or cyclones, and/or major flooding. \nRepresentatives from Bangladesh (Dhaka), India (New Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata), Indonesia \n(Jakarta), Pakistan (Karachi), Philippines (Metro Manila), and the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(Shanghai, Beijing, and Chengdu) will be invited. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The total cost of the TA is $800,000. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over an 8-month period, starting in August 2008 and ending \nin March 2009. It will be executed by the Capacity Development and Governance Division of \nADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department, in collaboration with ADB\u2019s Pacific \nDepartment and its Office of Cofinancing Operations. The organization of the conference and \nworkshop will be overseen by a steering committee comprising representatives of ADB and the \nMinistry of Finance of Japan. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  finance  10  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  10 \nperson-months of national. The proposed consultants are (i) a lead consultant and conference \ncontroller with specialist knowledge of financial and insurance products and markets and of \ncapital  risk  markets  (international,  4  months  intermittent);  (ii)  a  natural  hazard  modeling \ntechnical consultant (international, 3 months); (iii) a catastrophe insurance technical consultant \n(international, 3 months); (iv) an events management planner (national, 4 months); and (v) a \nconference coordinator (national, 6 months intermittent). Individual consultants will be recruited \nby ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. The technical \nconsultants will be selected using the single source selection method on the basis of their \ninvolvement in the earlier TA in this area (footnote 1). ADB will disseminate the outputs with a \nreport that will also be available on the ADB website and with internal and external press \nreleases.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nNatural Catastrophe Risk Insurance Mechanisms for the Asia and Pacific Region, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nStrengthened financial  Quicker national  1.
