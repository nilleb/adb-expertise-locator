THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to Solomon Islands for the Economic Growth and Fiscal Reform Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed program is a single-tranche policy-based grant of $5 million. The program \ncontinues efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the Government of Solomon \nIslands in implementing an ongoing reform program in coordination with other development \npartners. The proposed program will support continued policy attention to reform, which has \nbecome increasingly essential following recent natural disasters, the closure of a large gold \nmine (an important source of government revenue), and the decline of logging output over the \nmedium term. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Solomon Islands is one of the largest countries in Melanesia, with a land area of about \n28,000 square kilometers, comprising six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and hundreds \nof islets and atolls. About 85% of the population of 600,000 is rural, living in widely dispersed \nvillages  comprising  a  few  hundred  persons  each.  The  economy  is  based  on  primary \ncommodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing; alternative income-generating opportunities \nare scarce, especially in rural areas. The nation has been steadily recovering from the 1999\u2013\n2003 civil conflict. While the security situation is now stable, recent events\u2014such as the May \n2014  riots  and  looting  in  the  capital,  Honiara,  and  other  parts  of  Guadalcanal\u2014have \ndemonstrated the stability\u2019s fragile nature. \n \n4.  Creating an environment in Solomon Islands that fosters sustainable economic growth \nremains a challenge. The country continues to exhibit characteristics of a fragile state. State \nstructures lack the capacity to provide many of the basic functions for poverty reduction, the \nlegitimacy of the government has at times been weak, and public service delivery and economic \nmanagement needs strengthening. Remoteness is a particular challenge. Most people live far \nfrom  major  markets,  internal  dispersion  is  high,  transport  infrastructure  is  weak  (although \nsteadily  improving),  transport  costs  are  high,  and  transport  services  irregular.  Creating  an \nenabling environment for private sector-led growth, as well as enabling alternative drivers of \neconomic growth, are critical for expanding the current narrow economic base. ADB assistance \nin transport infrastructure and related capacity building is essential in revitalizing the economy \nand providing access to basic services. Support for selected projects in the energy sector, \ncomplementing  the  efforts  of  other  development  partners,  is  also  essential  to  sustainable \neconomic growth. \n \n5.  Solomon Islands was adversely affected by major natural disasters in 2014 and 2015. \nThe April 2014 floods caused per capita gross domestic product (GDP) to fall by 2.4%. Gold \nproduction  ceased,  and  damage  to  businesses,  houses,  and  public  infrastructure  was \nwidespread.  Private  enterprises  and  public  services  were  heavily  affected.  Damage  was \ncentered in and around Honiara, where dozens of people were killed, more than 10,000 were \ndisplaced, and 52,000 were otherwise affected. The government estimated flooding damage \nand losses at $108 million, or 9% of GDP. In March 2015, Cyclone Pam hit Solomon Islands, \nheavily damaging the easternmost province, Temotu. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2 \n6.  Gold output fell by more than 70% in 2014 because flooding halted production at the \ncountry\u2019s only mine, where operations are likely to remain suspended for some time. Flooding \nalso damaged transport links and disrupted log exports. Logging output has essentially been flat \nsince  2012,  with  production  sustained  by  secondary  harvests  in  previously  logged  areas. \nLogging output is expected to begin to decline over the next few years as forest area dwindles. \n \n7.  In November 2015, the government made a small downward revision in its forecast GDP \ngrowth rate for fiscal year 2015 from 3.50% to 3.25% (ADB\u2019s projected growth rate for 2015 is \n3.22%). The revised growth rate is due to weaker than expected output in the formal fishing and \nagriculture sectors, and slightly weaker than expected activity in the retail and wholesale trade \nsector. Weak global economic activity has contributed to lower commodity prices, resulting in \nlower copra and cocoa production. \n \n8.  Macroeconomic  policy  is  expected  to  remain  expansionary  through  to  2017.  After \ncoming to power late in 2014, the government used its first budget to signal a shift toward \nexpansionary fiscal policy after years of budget surpluses. Despite its late approval, the 2015 \nbudget resulted in a deficit estimated to equal 2.2% of GDP, financed by drawing down on \ngovernment cash reserves. In 2016, the government is targeting a fiscal deficit equal to 5.8% of \nGDP. Similar to 2015, weak execution means the actual deficit is likely to be smaller, estimated \nby ADB at 3.6% of GDP. Selected economic indicators are in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Economic Indicators, 2014\u20132017 \nItem  2014  2015 (e)  2016 (p)  2017 (p) \nGDP growth (%, constant prices)  2.0  3.2  3.0  2.8 \nInflation (annual % change)  5.2            (0.3)  4.4  5.7 \nOverall budget surplus (deficit) (% of GDP)  2.0  (2.2)  (3.6)  (3.9) \nExternal debt (% of GDP)  10.4  9.8  8.4  9.4 \nNominal GDP ($ million, current prices)  1,038.6  1,016.2  1,066.4  1,141.0 \n\u2026 = data not available, ( ) = negative, (e) = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product, (p) = projection. \nSources: Asian Development Outlook database, Central Bank of Solomon Islands; International Monetary Fund \nArticle IV Consultation Staff Reports (various years), and Solomon Islands National Statistics Office. \n \n9.  In March 2009, the government established a core economic working group (CEWG) to \nprovide a forum to discuss economic and financial reform priorities, monitor their implementation, \ncoordinate government and development partner support around these priorities, and undertake \nprogram monitoring to evaluate reform and assess impact.2 Since the establishment of the \nCEWG,  development  partners  have  provided  technical  and  financial  support  that  has \ncontributed  effectively  to  steady  reform  progress,  particularly  in  strengthening  budget \npreparation and planning systems, improving the quality of financial management systems, and \nimproving the environment for private sector investment. \n \n10.  The  program  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  and  country \npartnership strategy (CPS) for Solomon Islands.3 The Solomon Islands CPS focuses assistance \non creating a more diversified and productive economy. In line with this strategy, ADB supports \nthe government\u2019s national development strategy (NDS) for 2011\u20132020 through assistance in \nfour sectors: energy, information and communication technology, public sector management, \n                                                \n2  The CEWG comprises officials from the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, the Ministry of Development Planning \nand Aid Coordination, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, the Office of the Prime Minister, and development \npartner representatives from ADB, Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, the Regional Assistance Mission \nto Solomon Islands, and the World Bank. \n3  ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nand transport.4 ADB assistance in public sector management aims to promote an environment \nthat enables growth and development that is inclusive and led by the private sector. The CPS \ncalls for ADB support via the CEWG mechanism, in coordination with development partners, for \ngovernment-led public sector management reforms through policy-based program grants every \nother year. This program follows earlier ADB programs approved in 2010, 2011, and 2013.5 \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s  2013  program  focused  on  (i)  better  public  finance  management,  (ii) greater \neconomic efficiency for a business enabling environment, and (iii) broader access to social \nservices. The program was rated successful overall.6 Together with contributions from other \ndevelopment partners, the program grant of $5 million helped close the $9 million recurrent \nfinancing  gap  in  the  2013  budget.  The  final  budget  outcome  reported  a  fiscal  surplus  of \nSI$181.6 million ($22.99 million), against a revised deficit of SI$259.2 million ($32.81 million).7 \n \n12.  General elections were held in Solomon Islands on 19 November 2014. Subsequently, \nthe Democratic Coalition for Change government was formed. Progress on moving forward a \nprogram of economic and financial reform initially slowed because of the elections and change \nof government. This program is being used as a basis to reengage with the new government as \nits policy agenda continues to evolve. The first CEWG meeting, following the formation of the \nnew government, was held on 17 March 2015. In September 2015, technical working group \nmeetings resumed, and a CEWG meeting was held on 30 September 2015. \n \n13.  Including  the  proposed  budget  support  from  ADB,  the  government  is  anticipating \nSI$709.1 million in budget support in 2016, primarily comprising sector budget support from the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand. The European Union is the other main provider of \nsector budget support. For 2014\u20132020, under the 11th European Development Fund, it will \nfocus on the water and sanitation sector and on rural development. The World Bank\u2019s most \nrecent budget support program was processed in 2014 and is equivalent to $5 million.8 \n \n14.  ADB proposes a stand-alone, policy-based operation that will require all policy actions to \nbe accomplished in advance of grant effectiveness. Post program policy actions are identified \nfor  ongoing  monitoring  subsequent  to  grant  effectiveness.  The  program  supports \nimplementation of policies agreed with the government. Policy dialogue with the government on \nthe program includes (i) discussions on the design and implementation of the program policy \nmatrix,  (ii) CEWG  meetings,  and  (iii)  joint  review  missions  (JRMs)  with  government  and \ndevelopment partner representatives assessing program performance and identifying lessons \nfrom  program  implementation. 9  Earlier  budget  support  programs  by  ADB\u2014and  other \ndevelopment partners\u2014focused primarily on monetary and fiscal stability and strengthening the \ninstitutional framework for public expenditure and financial management. This program builds on \nthose earlier reforms, but broadens the policy actions to address the key challenges of ensuring \n                                                \n4  Government  of  Solomon  Islands,  Ministry  of  Development  Planning  and  Aid  Coordination.  2011.

The  program  incorporates  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  policy-based  operations  in  Solomon \nIslands and the Pacific: (i) limiting reform to a few major actions; (ii) using a single tranche within \na programmatic, multiyear approach supported by several partners; (iii) combining technical \nassistance with policy-based operations to undertake complex, politically sensitive reforms; and \n(iv) adopting a medium-term perspective, recognizing that thorough institutional and structural \nchange  requires  time  to  implement.10 ADB\u2019s  program  in  Solomon  Islands  combines  policy \nreform  support  with  investment  financing  to  support  inclusive,  environmentally  sustainable \neconomic  growth.  This  program  complements  operations  under  implementation,  or  being \nprocessed, in education, energy, and transport. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n16.  The impacts will be (i) to provide an enabling environment to stimulate economic growth, \nespecially in rural areas, and (ii) to pursue public sector reforms and commit resources to \nenable private sector-led growth.11 The outcome will be a strengthened economic and fiscal \nposition to deliver improved opportunities and living standards. \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The outcome will be achieved through three outputs: (i) improving public service delivery \nand economic management, (ii) creating an enabling environment for private sector-led growth, \nand (iii) enabling the drivers of economic growth (paras. 19\u201331). The policy matrix, with policy \nactions all completed, is in Appendix 4.12 \n \n18.  The policy reform actions in outputs 1 and 2 build on progress achieved since CEWG \nestablishment in 2009. Reform actions in output 3 follow from the recommendations of the 2014 \nJRM and reflect the CEWG\u2019s refocus on the drivers of economic growth. More broadly, these \nthree outputs support the wider objectives articulated in the government\u2019s policy documents \n(footnote 11) and the NDS (footnote 4). \n \n1.  Output 1: Improving Public Service Delivery and Economic Management \n19.  Public sector expenditure amounts to about half the formal economic activity in Solomon \nIslands. Improving public spending quality has been a primary focus of the CEWG since its \ninception,  and  a  feature  of  prior  budget  support  programs.  Improving  public  service \neffectiveness and efficiency will likely have a positive impact on Solomon Islanders\u2019 economic \ninclusion and well-being. In response to downward pressure on revenue mobilization from \ndecreasing mining and logging activity and to spending needs for post-disaster reconstruction, \nthe  program  will  support  new  customs  and  excise  legislation,  and  improvements  in  public \n                                                \n10 ADB, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, and the World Bank.

Along with a \nrevised NDS that prioritizes public spending for 2016\u20132036, this is expected to make the fiscal \nframework more sustainable. \n \n20.  Strengthening customs administration and revenue collection. Customs and excise \ncomprise about one-third of total government revenue. A comprehensive review of the customs \nregulatory regime undertaken in 2012 concluded that the Customs and Excise Act, 1960 was \nunsuited  to  modern  international  trade.  The  review  identified  a  number  of  improvements, \nincluding duty and excise assessment and collection, advanced reporting of arrivals, customs \npowers, and customs decisions. A draft Customs and Excise Bill to address these and other \nissues is in its final version. Under the program, Cabinet approved the draft legislation for \nsending to the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers for review, with the legislation now moving through \nthe review and approval stages, prior to consideration by Parliament. \n \n21.  Supporting improvements in public financial management. An assessment of public \nexpenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) in Solomon Islands in 2012 showed that most \nareas  of  PFM  had  improved  since  the  first  assessment  in  2008.13 The  Public  Financial \nManagement Act, 2013 and the PEFA assessments have provided the government with a \nplatform and the authority to introduce incremental reforms to build a credible and robust PFM \nsystem. Under the program, Cabinet approved the PFM road map, with implementation of \nselected actions now underway. The priorities in the roadmap focus on (i) implementation of the \nPublic  Financial  Management  Act;  (ii)  development  of  PFM  systems;  (iii)  compliance  with \ncontrols on budget, expenditure, and debt; and (iv) strengthening revenue collection.14 \n \n22.  Strengthening national development planning. The new government has begun a \nrevision of the existing NDS to cover 2016\u20132036 to provide a longer-term framework that will \nallow greater stability and continuity in planning. The proposed NDS establishes a vision and \nbroad strategic framework centered around five long-term objectives, with specific targets for \nyears 10, 15, and 20. The revision will also enable the government to incorporate a linkage to \nthe  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  and  strengthen  performance  targets  and  monitoring \nindicators. Under the program, Cabinet approved the new framework for the NDS, and is \nworking toward final approval of the new NDS later in 2016. \n \n2.  Output 2: Creating an Enabling Environment for Private Sector-Led Growth \n23.  The government has introduced a number of important structural reforms to improve the \nenabling environment for private sector-led growth. These include reforms that have made it \neasier to start a business, improve the performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and \nincrease the access to and affordability of telecommunications services. However, much more \nneeds  to  be  done  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  country\u2019s  investment  climate.  Regulatory \ninefficiencies can be a major constraint to economic growth and development. Reforms that \nincrease the security of land tenure, improve access to finance, and strengthen the business \nenvironment could significantly enhance inclusive economic growth. The program addresses \nthis by (i) improving the governance of alienated land through a new land board; (ii) initiating \n                                                \n13 ECORYS Nederland BV. 2008.

Improving the governance of alienated land. The main objective of the Lands and \nTitles (Amendment) Act, 2014 was to increase transparency and openness in the land allocation \nprocess and to provide and improve an administrative system to strengthen customer service \nand set the platforms for a justifiable and equitable land allocation system. To achieve this, the \nact established a land board composed of 13 members who will take on the powers (previously \nundertaken by the Commissioner of Lands) to deal with interests in land and deliberate on \napplications for land allocation and related issues. This allows staff in the Ministry of Lands, \nHousing and Survey to focus on administrative matters. The transfer of responsibilities to a land \nboard is also expected to provide greater certainty to the private sector. Under the program, the \nland board was established, and transparency of land transactions is being improved. \n  \n25.  Strengthening of credit unions policy. Credit unions play an important role in the \nfinancial services sector in Solomon Islands.15 The legislation\u2014the Credit Unions Act, 1986\u2014its \nregulations, and the standard credit union bylaws are outdated and no longer encompass best \npractice for the regulation and supervision of credit unions. Certain legislative provisions limit \nthe growth of credit unions and do not provide sufficiently for the protection of member deposits. \nA credit unions policy taskforce was established to finalize a credit unions policy seeking to \naddress these issues. The program supported the approval by Cabinet of this policy, and will \nnow support the drafting of a new Credit Union Bill and regulations, which will provide the legal \nunderpinning for the central bank to register, license, regulate, and supervise credit unions. An \nupdated regulatory framework would help put the industry on a sound footing from where it can \ngrow sustainably. A growing credit union industry would contribute to the government\u2019s agenda \nof increasing access to financial services and promoting financial sector development. \n \n26.  Developing  competition  policy.  The  country  lacks  a  formal  competition  policy  or \ngenerally applicable competition law. Competition policy has an important role to play in private \nsector growth in Solomon Islands. Legislation in place enables the government to set price \ncontrols, protect industries, and restrict foreign investment into the country\u2014all of which are \ninconsistent with competition and might impose significant costs. Careful scrutiny is required to \ndetermine whether such measures are economically and socially justified and provide effective \nsolutions to the problems they are intended to address. Under the program, Cabinet approved \nthe initial competition policy work, and the program will now support the government to move \nahead with a competition policy that will examine (i) pro-competitive regulation of public utilities, \n(ii) possible new laws against anticompetitive conduct in business, (iii) possible updates to \nexisting consumer protection laws, (iv) effective enforcement of consumer protection laws, and \n(v) the promotion of competitive neutrality and a \u201clevel playing field\u201d for public and private sector \nenterprises in Solomon Islands. \n \n27.  Improving the capital structure of state-owned enterprises. The Solomon Islands \nSOE portfolio has undergone a dramatic turnaround since 2008 and is now the most profitable \nportfolio in the Pacific in the benchmarking sample in ADB\u2019s assessment. The average return on \nequity of the portfolio increased from \u201312% in 2002\u20132008 to 6% for 2009\u20132012 and 15% in \n2012.16 Cabinet endorsement was given to the development of an SOE capital structure policy \n                                                \n15 Credit unions are financial cooperative organizations, owned and controlled by their members. Their central \npurpose is to provide savings, credit, and other financial services to their members. As of December 2013, the \n10 credit unions in Solomon Islands had a total membership of about 5,700 and total assets of SI$50.6 million. \n16 ADB.  2014.

The policy, now \nunder preparation, will include (i) a clear mechanism for the provision of additional equity by the \ngovernment and, conversely, the return of equity to the government by SOEs; (ii) the minimum \nrequired return on the shareholder equity or assets and dividend distribution arrangements; (iii) \nguidance  on  the  level  and  mix  of  capital  used  to  fund  the  projected  capital  expenditure \nrequirements of SOEs; and (iv) flexibility for SOEs to be able to find appropriated value-adding \ninvestment opportunities and flexibility for SOE capital requirements to be considered in the \ncontext of broader government budgetary and policy requirements. \n \n28.  Improving  business  formalization.  The  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  has \nundertaken extensive business law reform activity, including the passing of the Companies Act, \n2010,  and  the  launch  of  an  online  company  registry,  Company  Haus.  Building  on  earlier \nprograms, this program continued to support business law reform activity in relation to business \nnames, including enacting legislation and now preparation of associated regulations. Company \nHaus will also upgrade its paper-based business names registry to an electronic registry. The \nability to register a business name provides opportunities for sole traders, partnerships, and \ncompanies to operate a business under a name other than their actual name. This has a range \nof benefits, including an encouraging environment for businesses to enter the formal economy, \nimproved fraud detection, protection of a business\u2019s goodwill, and greater tax compliance. \n \n3.  Output 3: Enabling the Drivers of Economic Growth \n29.  Although Solomon Islands\u2019 geographical isolation limits medium-term growth prospects, \nopportunities exist for increasing the revenue base. As logging activity starts to taper when \nstocks are exhausted, the development and management of alternative natural resources has \nbecome  a  strategic  government  priority.  Mining,  fisheries,  and  tourism  offer  potential \nopportunities,  but  significant  institutional  reforms  and  technical  assistance  are  needed  to \nstrengthen the sectors\u2019 regulation and management.17 The program contributes to these critical \nreforms by strengthening fisheries\u2019 governance and management through new legislation and \nby developing a new tourism strategy to attract overseas visits, including from cruise ships. This \nwill help to harness the growth potential in these sectors.  \n \n30.  Strengthening  fisheries  management.  Solomon  Islands  has  a  significant  tuna \nresource, which could deliver significantly greater economic benefits to the country if it were \nmore  effectively  utilized.  Under  the  program,  new  fisheries  legislation  was  enacted,  with \nimplementation  of  the  legislation  now  being  supported,  including  the  development  of \naccompanying regulations. The new act makes a provision for the conservation, management, \ndevelopment, and sustainable use of fisheries and marine resources in Solomon Islands, as \nwell as strengthening the monitoring and control of fishing vessels. The act provides for the \nestablishment of a Fisheries Licensing Committee, Fisheries Appeals Committee, and Fisheries \nAdvisory Council; as well as the establishment of fisheries management plans at national, \nprovincial, and community levels. The act will mean that Solomon Islands fisheries resources \nwill be used more sustainably, balancing economic growth with sound ecological principles. \n \n31.  Developing tourism potential. Solomon Islands\u2019 tourism is widely viewed as having \nsignificant potential, but remains largely untapped. In 2014, about 6,000 tourists visited the \ncountry, compared with 110,000 in Vanuatu that year. Few visitors venture outside of Honiara \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2016. Continuing Reforms to Stimulate Private Sector Investment: A Private Sector Assessment for Solomon \nIslands. Manila. \n ", "8 \nand Guadalcanal. The Solomon Islands National Tourism Development Strategy, 2015\u20132019, \nnow approved under program, is designed to identify and address sector-related impediments to \nfacilitate faster economic growth and increased benefits from tourism, including in rural areas. \nThe focus of the strategy is on small-scale tourism, based on niche markets. Cruise ships also \nprovide a key development opportunity for the sector; the Solomon Islands receives a small but \ngrowing number of visitors from this market and the strategy highlights key constraints and \nrecommended actions to increase the level of tourists. With support from development partners, \nimplementation on the strategy is now underway. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n32.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.18 The  proposed  grant  size  is  within  the \nestablished country allocation and was determined after considering (i) the relative importance \nof economic and financial reform to promote sustained economic growth, (ii) the country\u2019s \ndevelopment financing needs, (iii) the availability of financing from other development partners, \n(iv) the significance and complexity of the program\u2019s policy actions, and (v) the conformity of the \nprogram with ADB\u2019s CPS for Solomon Islands. Program grant proceeds will help finance the \nprojected fiscal deficit for 2016 of SI$568.5 million ($71.97 million), and support key investment \nprojects identified in the 2016 budget, as outlined in the development policy letter (Appendix 3). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n33.  The program period is from 1 March 2015 to 31 March 2017. Program funding will be \nprovided as a single-tranche grant of $5 million and will be withdrawn when the government \nmeets the conditions for effectiveness, including completing the agreed prior policy actions as \nset  forth  in  the  policy  matrix.  Grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  using  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans.19 The government and \nADB  will  continuously  review  program  implementation  using  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework and the policy matrix. Proceeds will be used to finance items produced and procured \nin ADB member countries, excluding items in the list of ineligible items and imports financed by \nother bilateral and multilateral sources.20 \n \n34.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) will be the executing and implementing \nagency and will be responsible for overall implementation, including implementing all policy \nactions, administering the program, disbursing funds, and maintaining all program records. \nMOFT will monitor and report to ADB on the implementation of policy actions and their impact \non budget outcomes in line with the design and monitoring framework. Monitoring outcomes and \nimpacts will maximize the use of the government\u2019s own processes and the CEWG mechanism. \n \n35.  In cooperation with the government and CEWG development partners, ADB will continue \nto carry out periodic JRMs. The reviews will evaluate the implementation of the policy reform \nand assess impact, describe lessons identified during the program period, and outline policy \nactions and any assistance needed to accomplish the agreed reform targets. The government \nwill continue to keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \n                                                \n18 A country\u2019s eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Solomon Islands had a moderate risk of \ndebt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. \n19 ADB. 1998.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n36.  The program is focused on improving the quality of public spending, improving the \nenvironment for doing business, and enabling the drivers of economic growth. Having stabilized \nits  immediate  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  position,  and  made  progress  on  improving  PFM \nsystems, the government\u2019s priorities have shifted to a medium-term program to consolidate and \nadvance  its  economic  and  financial  reform  program,  while  putting  in  place  the  necessary \nsupporting reforms to improve development outcomes and strengthen economic growth. \n \nB.  Governance \n37.  The government and its development partners continue to support various aspects of \nPFM, procurement, anticorruption, and other governance reforms. A PEFA assessment was first \nundertaken  in  2008,  with  a  follow-up  assessment  in  2012  (footnote  13).  While  some \ncomponents of the PFM system involve risks, the PFM road map draws all relevant actions to \nstrengthen the PFM system into a single document over a 3-year period.21 Procurement reviews \nwere undertaken in 2012 and 2014.22 More generally, ADB participates along with government \nand CEWG partners in the annual review of the government\u2019s progress in implementing its \nreform agenda, with the most recent review endorsed by the CEWG in March 2015.23 \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOFT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the legal documents.24 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n39.  While Solomon Islands does not have a national poverty reduction strategy, poverty \nalleviation is one of eight objectives of the current NDS. The Democratic Coalition for Change \ngovernment policy statement also focuses on the prevention and alleviation of poverty. \n \n40.  The program is classified as some gender elements. ADB supported the completion of a \ncountry gender assessment in 2015.25 This assessment examines the progress toward gender \nequality across social, economic, and political spheres in Solomon Islands, such as health, \neducation, work, political participation, and gender-based violence. The Ministry of Women, \nYouth, Children and Family Affairs will be taking the assessment report to the cabinet for \nendorsement and subsequent launch. The report\u2019s recommendations will then be taken to the \ngender focal points in each ministry to see how they can be integrated into sector plans and \nprograms where appropriate. This work will feed into the government\u2019s national planning work \nand is included under action 1.3 of the policy matrix. \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 World Bank. 2012.
