The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has experienced rapid urbanization over the last two \ndecades of economic reforms, largely fueled by the transformation of suburban areas from farming \nto non-farming activity, and by the migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas.  Urbanization as \na policy issue took on new importance after the Third Plenum of the 15th Party Congress in 1998, \nwhen it was elevated to a national strategy.  The Government highlighted urbanization as a key \npolicy area in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) and will continue to emphasize sustainable \nurbanization in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n2005  country  programming  review  mission,  the  Government  requested  ADB  for  technical \nassistance (TA) to review its urbanization policies with a focus on strengthening capacities of \nmetropolitan regions1 to sustain rapid urbanization. Fact-finding for the TA was undertaken in \nOctober  2005  and  an  understanding  was  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  impact  and \noutcome, scope, costs and financing, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nTA.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government sees urbanization as a way of reducing rural\u2013urban inequalities and of \nsustaining  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy.    Urbanization  can  make  a  major \ncontribution  to  reducing  inequalities  because  productivity  and  wage  rates  in  urban  economic \nsectors  are  many  times  higher  than  those  in  the  agriculture  sector.  International  experience \nindicates that the more urbanized a country, the more likely it is to experience higher rates of \nproductivity  and  resulting  prosperity.    Historical  patterns  of  development  suggest  that  an \nurbanization rate of 40\u201350% is often associated with rapid urban growth that begins to moderate \nwhen a country becomes about 70% urbanized. The United Nations projects that the PRC will \nreach 40% urbanization in 2005, 50% between 2010 and 2015, and 60% by 2030.              \n \n3.  Many  cities  are  undergoing  rapid  growth  that  is  expanding  urban  areas  well  beyond \ntraditional municipal boundaries.  The growth of metropolitan regions in the PRC over at least the \npast 15 years has largely been through accretion, with suburban households and firms avoiding \nadministrative constraints to residency, employment, enterprise formation, and land tenure in urban \ndistricts.  Given rapidly increasing population densities in suburban areas, and the relative ease of \nindustrial  enterprise  formation,  farming  areas  on  the  outskirts  of  urban  districts  have  been \ntransformed into semiformal suburban precincts fairly easily.  The urbanization process is now \nbeing accelerated through migration, predominantly from rural areas but also from other cities.  \nThe result of these forces has been the explosion not only of coastal cities but also of some inland \ncities such as Chengdu.     \n \n4.  There are today 53 metropolitan regions in the PRC anchored on cities with over 1 million \nnon-farming residents and comprising selected adjacent counties and county-level cities.  They \ncontain almost 370 million people, or 29% of the country\u2019s population, but produce 53% of the \nPRC\u2019s GDP and 62.3% of all non-farming GDP from manufacturing, construction, and services.  \nMost of the PRC\u2019s metropolitan regions still have low levels of urbanization, and hence unrealized \nagglomeration economies that generally come with highly urbanized regions.  Only 15 of 53 \nmetropolitan regions have urbanization levels over 70%.  Except for Urumqi, all the metropolitan \nregions in the central and western PRC have urbanization levels under 70%, with the majority in \n                                                 \n1  Metropolitan regions are functional urban areas anchored on a statutory city with more than 1 million non-farming \nresidents, and extending to cover labor and other input markets within an approximately 50-kilometer (km) radius of \nthe core city, or a 1-hour drive time from the city center.  In the PRC such regions usually cross municipal boundaries. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 28 April 2005.   ", "2   \nthe 40\u201360% range.  While just over half of the PRC\u2019s metropolitan regions are in coastal provinces \n(28 of 53), half of these have urbanization levels under 70%.  There is therefore considerable \nscope for additional urbanization in both coastal and interior metropolitan regions. \n \n5.  Despite  their  low  levels  of  urbanization,  negative  externalities  of  urban  and  suburban \ngrowth are already becoming apparent and need to be addressed through more effective policy \nmeasures.  Air and water pollution continue to be serious problems in the PRC\u2019s cities, and are \nnow spreading to previously rural parts of suburban areas.  Carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide \nfrom motor vehicle emissions are growing contributors to air pollution.  Water shortages and \npollution continue to be major problems for many cities.  Of the PRC\u2019s 658 cities, the Ministry of \nWater Resources (MWR) reports that 420 had water shortages at the end of 2003.  In 2001, 53% \nof monitored sections of the seven key river systems in the PRC had water quality of Class V or \nbelow.3 Land consumption is also becoming a serious issue.  Many of the PRC\u2019s metropolitan \nregions  are  beginning  to  expand  rapidly  through  undirected  suburbanization.  The  result  is \nconsumption of agricultural land and growing urban sprawl that is causing inefficient land use, land \nmarkets, goods transport, public transport, and public services.  In addition to worsening traffic \ncongestion, many urban regions in the PRC have weak transport links between the core city and \nsuburban towns, and between these towns.  This limits the participation of suburban workers in \nmetropolitan labor markets and constrains the development of efficient supply relationships for \nsuburban enterprises.  Aside from equity concerns, limited physical access drives up prices of \ninner-city labor and land and reduces competitiveness.  \n \n6.  The PRC and ADB have collaborated in several projects focused on meeting the growing \ndemand for urban infrastructure and improving the environmental quality of urban life in cities such \nas Anhui, Changchun, Fuzhou, Harbin, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wenzhou, Wuhan, and Zhangjiakou. \nThese projects have typically included sewage treatment plants, water supply, and cleaning up \nrivers and lakes in the cities. Policy support and capacity building have also been provided through \nadvisory TA. However, there is now an urgent need for ADB to adopt a more systematic and \ncomprehensive approach to its support for urban development in the PRC. Urban development \ncuts across a number of sectors, including environment, water supply and sanitation, transport and \nenergy and interventions often include several subprojects or components. Further, there is a need \nfor ADB to broaden its involvement to cover projects that promote integrated urban development \ncovering water supply and conservation, sewage treatment, solid waste management, clean air \nprogram and, vehicular emission reduction. \n \n7.  This  TA  is  a  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  interest  in  promoting  urbanization  in \nmetropolitan regions to strengthen agglomeration economies that can generate a wide range of \nemployment opportunities for rural migrants.  However, the Government is also intent on making  \nthis urbanization environmentally sustainable. The TA will support the Government\u2019s efforts to \nidentify  and  promote  policies  that  ensure  the  economically  and  environmentally  sustainable \nurbanization of the PRC\u2019s metropolitan regions. The TA will also provide recommendations on how \nADB can help the Government to pursue a more systematic approach to urban development. The \nTA  will  complement  a  recently  completed  town-based  urbanization  strategy  TA  which \nrecommended focusing development of towns in metropolitan regions and along transport and \neconomic corridors.4         \n \n                                                 \n3  The PRC water quality standards have five classes covering about 40 pollution parameters. Class I is pristine, while \nclass V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal water supply. \n4  ADB. 2004.

ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP), 2004\u20132006,5 and CSP update (2006\u20132008)6 \nfor the PRC support the country\u2019s development strategy and are designed to promote pro-poor \neconomic growth by enabling the poor to have greater access to the opportunities and benefits of \neconomic prosperity. ADB\u2019s operational program aims to (i) reduce inequalities, (ii) make markets \nwork better, (iii) improve the environment, and (iv) promote regional cooperation. A workable \nurbanization strategy, particularly for rapidly-growing metropolitan regions, can have a significant \nimpact on pro-poor economic growth in the PRC. This TA is in line with the goals of the CSP and \nsupports the Government\u2019s economic development and poverty reduction objectives.   \n \n9.  The  urban  sector  in  the  PRC  has  also  received  considerable  assistance  from  other \nmultilateral and bilateral development partners.  The World Bank is currently carrying out a study \non metropolitan area development in the PRC that is expected to focus on specific infrastructure \nand governance themes over the next 3 years. The World Bank, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC), Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and others \nhave supported water supply and wastewater treatment projects in many large cities, as well as \nmore  comprehensive  urban  environmental  projects.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  close \ncollaboration with the World Bank and other partners to ensure that TA outputs are effectively \ncoordinated.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA7 will be seen in more effective urbanization processes and patterns, \nwith fewer negative and more positive externalities. It will help to increase productivity and living \nstandards. The first outcomes of the TA will be a coherent urbanization strategy adopted by the \nGovernment during the 11th Five-Year Plan, the selection of regions and cities to spearhead the \nPRC\u2019s urbanization strategy, and the identification of priority investment and policy areas that will \nneed special attention by the Government. The second group of outcomes will be an improved, \nfocused, effective, and efficient ADB urban sector operational strategy in the PRC and a new \nPRC\u2013ADB urban strategy to guide lending and nonlending operations over the next 5 years.    \n          \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have five parts. Part A, formulation of urbanization scenarios, will consist of \nthree sets of urbanization scenarios to 2020 for the PRC as a whole, for the Sichuan Plain region, \nfor the middle Yangtze region, and for the metropolitan regions of Chengdu (Sichuan province) and \nWuhan (Hubei province).8 These scenarios will reflect varying assumptions on the rate, timing, and \nlocation of urbanization.  \n  \n12.  Part B, implications of urbanization scenarios, will assess the scenarios for Chengdu and \nWuhan in the following areas.  \n \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2003.

The final case study cities will be confirmed by NDRC in January 2006.   ", "4   \n(i)  Employment  generation  required  to  sustain  the  scenarios,  supported  by  an \nassessment of the production capacities, competitiveness, and market conditions \nneeded to realize sustainable employment. \n(ii)  Social services capacities, especially for education, training, and health services, \nincluding in suburban areas, and social security, including for rural migrants. \n(iii)  Environmental carrying capacities, with a focus on land requirements, implications \nfor food production, supply of potable water, and energy requirements. \n(iv)  Infrastructure  capacities,  including  water  treatment,  domestic  and  industrial \nwastewater treatment, and domestic solid waste. \n(v)  Transport capacities, including the roads and regional public rail systems needed to \nmeet the demands of each scenario. \n(vi)  Governance  capacities,  especially  in  the  planning  and  monitoring  of  urban \ndevelopment, and delivery of infrastructure, transport, and social services. \n(vii)  Financing capacities, to support the capital and recurrent investments implied by \neach scenario. \n13.  Part C, policy options, will review successful and unsuccessful policy experiences in four \nmetropolitan regions in other countries that share key characteristics of metropolitan regions in the \nPRC. A study tour by key National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) officials to these \ncase study cities will focus on specific policies addressing the implications identified in Part B.  \nSuccessful policies applied in the PRC will also be identified and documented.  A policy matrix will \nbe prepared that identifies the relevance, effectiveness, efficacy, institutional requirements, and \ndependencies of each policy.  Policy options will be reviewed at a workshop attended by central \ngovernment agencies, representatives of the provincial governments of Sichuan and Hubei, and \nmunicipal governments of Wuhan and Chengdu. Based on the workshop discussions, NDRC will \nidentify the policy options most relevant to the PRC.   \n  \n14.  Part D, policy framework, will consist of consultants recommending the most appropriate \ninstruments for the selected policies to be implemented, and the phasing and implementation \nresponsibilities among levels of government.  Part E, PRC\u2013ADB urban strategy, will consist of \nconsultants working with ADB and the Government to develop a five-year strategy and action plan \nto guide ADB\u2019s lending and nonlending operations in the PRC.  This strategy will address the \ndemands of metropolitan regions, but could include smaller cities and towns.  \n \n15.  Three  workshops  will  be  held.  The  first,  in  Beijing,  will  focus  on  developing  realistic \nassumptions to guide the preparation of the urbanization scenarios for the country as a whole, for \nthe Sichuan plain and the middle Yangtze region. This workshop will be attended by central \ngovernment representatives, senior academics and policy advisors.  The second workshop will be \nheld at the conclusion of part C, policy options. It will be held in either Chengdu or Wuhan and, in \naddition to central government representatives, it will include officials from the Sichuan and Hubei \nprovincial  governments,  and  from  the  municipal  governments  of  Chengdu  and  Wuhan.    The \npurpose of this workshop will be to review policy options for supporting sustainable urbanization of \nmetropolitan regions in the PRC and to develop a consensus on to the most practicable policies.  \nThe  final  workshop  will  be  held  in  Beijing  and,  aside  from  central,  provincial  and  municipal \ngovernments, will include representatives from the World Bank, the European Union, JBIC, and \nbilateral agencies with urban operations in the PRC.  The purpose of this workshop will be to \npresent and review the TA findings with a focus on the recommended policy framework and the \nPRC\u2013ADB urban strategy.   \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $625,000 equivalent, of which $302,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $323,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.  The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$198,000 equivalent of the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. The Government of the PRC has agreed to provide the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $125,000 for counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative \nsupport, logistics, and interpretation services. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  NDRC\u2019s Department of Development Planning (DDP) will be the Executing Agency for the \nTA.    DDP  will  form  a  steering  committee  and  provide  policy  guidance,  facilitate  interagency \ncoordination, and address any institutional problems.  The steering committee will be composed of \nrepresentatives of NDRC, Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Construction (MOC), MWR, State \nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency  (SEPA),  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Land  (MNRL), \nMinistry of Civil Affairs (MCA), and the two case study provinces. It will meet at least three times \nduring the course of the TA: at inception, to review the interim report, and to review the draft final \nreport.   \n \n18.  DDP will appoint a senior officer as project manager, assisted by other qualified counterpart \nstaff. NDRC will assure the cooperation of the case study provinces in working with the consultants \nand facilitating their work. It will also assure the participation of other ministries, including MOC, \nMWR, SEPA, and MNLR during implementation of the TA. Office space and facilities will be \nprovided in Beijing by NDRC and in the two provinces by the provincial development and reform \ncommissions. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months beginning in May 2006 (shortly after \nthe end of the National People\u2019s Congress) and the expected completion date is December 2006. \nThe TA will help the Government to formulate a detailed national urbanization strategy. The total \ninput of the consultants is estimated at 30 person-months, consisting of 10 person-months of \ninternational  staff  and  20  person-months  of  domestic.    The  international  consulting  team  will \nprovide a team leader with broad experience in all aspects of the urban sector and specialists in \nurban  development  policy,  urban  economics,  urban  environmental  management,  and  urban \ntransport. The domestic team will include specialists with expertise in urban or regional geography, \nregional  economics,  water  resources  management,  water  and  wastewater  engineering,  urban \ntransport planning, energy management, municipal finance, and financial analysis. The consultants \nwill be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. The \nquality-cost based selection method, using a simplified technical proposal, will be adopted. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.   \n \nIV.

The technical assistance (TA) will consist of five closely related parts.  While the purpose \nof the TA is to inform national policies on sustainable urbanization, much of the work will focus \non two representative metropolitan regions: the Chengdu metropolitan region, which includes \nthe prefecture-level cities of Deyang and Mianyang to the north; and the Wuhan metropolitan \nregion. The consultant team will coordinate and cooperate closely during implementation with \nanother TA to be administered by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD):  PRC: \nApplication of Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Urban Railway-Based Transportation.   \n \nA.  Part A: Formulation of Urbanization Scenarios \n2.  This component will consist of three sets of urbanization scenarios to 2020 for the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) as a whole, for the Sichuan plain region,1 for the middle \nYangtze region, and for the metropolitan regions of Chengdu2 (Sichuan province) and Wuhan \n(Hubei province).  These scenarios will reflect varying assumptions on the rate, timing, and \nlocation of urbanization.  Consultants will conduct the following activities. \n \n(i)   Obtain  from  leading  national  policy  institutes  the  most  recent  population \nprojections for the PRC to the year 2020 and review the underlying demographic \nassumptions of these projections. \n(ii)  Review  with  the  State  Statistical  Bureau,  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC), Ministry of Construction (MOC), and leading national policy \ninstitutes their historical estimates of urbanization levels from 1970 to the present, \nand their estimates of urbanization rates to 2020 (accounting for differing official \ndefinitions of \u201curban\u201d during the last 35 years).  \n(iii)   Review  United  Nations,  World  Bank,  United  Nations  Centre  for  Human \nSettlements,  and  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nprojections of urbanization in East Asia and the PRC to 2020, and establish their \nconvergence or otherwise with PRC Government projections. \n(iv)  Define key assumptions on economic growth and demographic changes in the \nPRC to 2020 to define the basis for urbanization scenarios.  \n(v)  On the basis of these assumptions, prepare three urbanization scenarios at the \nnational level including projections of urban populations to 2020.  \n(vi)  Present these scenarios to government representatives at the first TA workshop in \nBeijing; participants will include personnel from NDRC, MOC, Ministry of Civil \nAffairs (MCA), Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS), and Ministry of \nNatural Resources and Land (MNRL). \n(vii)  Adjust these national scenarios based on inputs from the workshop. \n(viii)  Based on the final national scenarios, prepare three linked urbanization scenarios \nfor the middle Yangtze region and the Sichuan plain to 2020.  \n(ix)  Through discussions with provincial and municipal governments in both Hubei and \nSichuan,  prepare  three  urbanization  scenarios  to  2020  for  the  Chengdu  and \n                                                 \n1  Including the province-level municipality of Chongqing. \n2  Including Deyang and Mianyang prefecture-level cities. \n ", "  Appendix  3   11 \nWuhan  metropolitan regions to 2020, linked to the urbanization scenarios for their \nrespective larger regions. \n(x)  Review  these  metropolitan  region  urbanization  scenarios  with  provincial  and \nmunicipal governments, and finalize them.  \nB.  Part B: Implications of Urbanization Scenarios \n3.  The second component will consist of an assessment of the implications of urbanization \nscenarios for Chengdu and Wuhan on the following. \n \n(i)  Employment  generation  required  to  sustain  the  scenarios,  supported  by  an \nassessment of the production capacities, competitiveness, and market conditions \nneeded to generate sustainable employment in the two metropolitan regions, \nincluding in suburban towns and satellite cities. \n(ii)  Social services capacities, especially for education, health services, and training \nof unskilled and semi-skilled rural migrant workers, including in suburban areas, \nand the provision of social security to rural migrants. \n(iii)  Land requirements, based on differing population densities and broad land uses \nemerging from the economic assumptions underlying the urbanization scenario. \n(iv)  Water  requirements  for  agricultural,  domestic,  industrial,  and  municipal \nconsumption under each scenario. \n(v)  Energy requirements for transport, heating and cooling, and industry for each \nscenario. \n(vi)  Infrastructure requirements, including for water treatment, domestic and industrial \nwastewater  treatment,  and  domestic  solid  waste  to  meet  current  national \nstandards. \n(vii)  Transport  requirements,  including expressway  and  feeder  roads  in  suburban \nareas, and regional public transport systems needed to reasonably meet the \ndemands of each scenario. \n(viii)  Governance capacities, especially in the coordination of planning and monitoring \nof urban development, and in the efficient delivery of regional infrastructure, \ntransport, and social services. \n(ix)  Financing capacities, to support the capital and recurrent investments implied \nunder each scenario. \n \nC.  Part C: Policy Options \n4.  Part C will review of successful and unsuccessful policy experiences in other countries \nthat  may  be  relevant  to  urbanization  scenarios  in  Chengdu  and  Wuhan,  and  to  other \nmetropolitan regions in the PRC. This component will include case studies of 4\u20135 metropolitan \nregions that share key characteristics of metropolitan region growth with the two PRC case \nstudy regions and with other cities in the PRC. NDRC has already researched experiences in \nJapan and the United States extensively, and wishes to expand this research to include Asian \nand Latin American experience. Consultants will be encouraged to recommend and explain \nother options. A high-level study tour will be led by senior NDRC officials, who are directly \nresponsible for formulation and implementation of urbanization strategies in the PRC,  to visit \nthe case study cities to review specific policies and policy instruments. The consultant will ", "12  Appendix 3 \ndesign the study tour, including the identification of themes and policies with NDRC, and the \narrangement of meetings in all cities.  The study tour plan will be submitted for prior approval to \nthe ADB project officer. \n \n5.  Successful  policies  applied  in  other  metropolitan  regions  in  the  PRC  will  also  be \nidentified and documented.  A policy matrix will be prepared that identifies the relevance, \neffectiveness,  efficacy,  institutional  capacity  requirements,  and  policy  and  regulatory \ndependencies of each policy.   \n \n6.  Policy options will be reviewed in a workshop attended by central government agencies, \nrepresentatives of provincial governments of Hubei and Sichuan, and municipal governments of \nChengdu, Deyang, Mianyang, and Wuhan.  Based on discussions at this workshop, NDRC will \nselect the policy options it believes are most relevant to the PRC.  The consultant will organize \nthis workshop and record discussions. \n \nD.  Part D: Policy Framework \n7.  The fourth component will consist of consultants recommending the most appropriate \ninstruments through which the selected policies can be implemented, and the phasing and \nimplementation responsibilities among levels of government.  Generally, three broad types of \ninstruments will be assessed: provision of information and/or education; provision of economic \nincentives; and regulatory instruments.  For each policy in the framework, the consultant will \ndefine specific instruments that are likely to be most effective in implementing the policy.  These \ninstruments will need to be specifically targeted at the level of government best equipped to \nimplement the policy.   \n \n8.  Phasing of policy recommendations will need to be carefully considered and described.  \nPhasing should be tied to key points in the Five-Year Plan preparation process.     \n \nE.  Part E: PRC\u2013ADB Urban Strategy \n9.  The final component will consist of consultants working with ADB and Government \nrepresentatives to develop a 5-year strategy and action plan to guide lending and non-lending \noperations in metropolitan regions and smaller cities and towns in the PRC.  \n \n10.  For this component, the consultants will undertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Review ADB\u2019s May 1999 urban sector profile and identify areas where it is \noutdated and where new information or new policy directions require it to be \nmodified or added to.  \n(ii)  Using the analyses completed under this TA and other sources, review and \nrevise the discussion of urbanization trends contained in the 1999 report. \n(iii)  Revise  where  necessary  the  discussion  on  institutional,  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks, incorporating the most recent changes and any planned changes. \n(iv)  Through extensive discussions with officials at NDRC, MOF, and other ministries, \nIdentify and prioritize key issues that ADB\u2019s program should address. \n(v)  Review  recent  changes  to  financing  modalities  and  operational  policies  and \nprocedures at ADB and review with ADB project officers the possible implications \nof these changes on urban operations in the PRC. \n ", "  Appendix  3   13 \n(vi)  Review ADB\u2019s most recent country strategy and program update, and ensure \nthat  the  proposed  urban  strategy  reflects  the  policies  and  directions  in  that \ndocument.  \n(vii)  Assess the situation with regard to external assistance, including that offered by  \nADB, other multilateral organizations, and bilateral aid.  Identify opportunities for \nbetter coordination of external assistance. \n(viii)  Develop proposals for the Bank\u2019s strategy over the next five years, identify areas \nof intervention and policy dialogue, and review these in close consultation with \nEast and Central Asia Regional Department/Social Sectors Division and ADB\u2019s \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Resident Mission staff, and with the PRC officials in \nMOF and NDRC. \n(ix)  Recommend a new PRC\u2013ADB urban strategy to guide lending and nonlending \noperations based on the analyses completed in this TA, interviews with the PRC \nofficials, recent studies, policy changes, and other inputs. \n(x)  Organize, hold, and report on a closing national workshop for the TA in Beijing.  \nIn addition to central, provincial and municipal governments, participants will \ninclude representatives from the World Bank, European Union, Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, and other bilateral agencies with urban operations in \nthe PRC.  The purpose of this workshop will be to present and review all TA \nfindings with a focus on the recommended policy framework and the PRC\u2013ADB \nurban strategy.  \n(xi)  Review all available ADB Operations Evaluation Department evaluation reports \non performance of the integrated urban development projects (IUDPs), lessons \nlearned,  conclusions  and  recommendations.  Assess  the  feasibility  of  all \nappropriate approaches (IUDP and others) for adoption in developing the PRC \nurban sector. \n(xii)  Identify  ADB's  relevance  and  value-added  for  governance  and  financing \nactivities. The analyses of governance and finance are especially important to \npart C of the study, where the consultants will develop an \"action plan to guide \nlending and nonlending operations\". The action plan for ADB's involvement in \nsupporting integrated urban development should be based on an understanding \nof what the urban areas can do on their own and where ADB's help is relevant \nand can add value. The consultants will review urban areas' access to domestic \nand international credit markets to identify the relevance and value-added of \nADB's financing, and how ADB can help improve access. The consultants will \nalso review planning and technical needs (in engineering, finance, environment, \netc), to understand the kind of technical assistance that will be relevant for ADB \nto supply, and how ADB can help improve capacities. \n(xiii)  Review lessons learned in ADB's IUDP projects in other countries. ADB has \nmade many loans for integrated urban development in the past, especially in \nSouth Asia.  Review all relevant project completion reports, project performance \nreports, and special evaluation studies that describe the problems with integrated \nurban development projects and the conclusions and recommendations. When \nthe consultants develop the action plan (see (xii), above), they should review the \nlessons  learned  in  other  urban  development  projects.  They  should  also \nrecommend a framework for choosing the type of loan.  ", "14  Appendix 3 \n \n(xiv)  During TA implementation, the ADB ECRD, Governance, Finance, and Trade \nDivision will be consulted on the feasibility of financial intermediation loans in the \nPRC and the Government\u2019s views on and willingness to undertake such loans.  \n \nF.  Reporting \n11.  The consultants will submit an inception report within 1 month of commencing their \nconsultancies, an interim report on completion of part C after 5 months, a draft final report \n(including the PRC\u2013ADB urban strategy) after 7 months, and a final report after 8 months.  The \nresults of the study will be disseminated in part through a series of workshops in Beijing and in \nworking meetings in the case study provinces and municipalities. \n \n12.  The inception report will include a work plan, the identification of potential risks to TA \nimplementation, and proposed mitigation measures, and a summary of key findings to date.   \n \n13.  The  interim  report  will  document  parts  A,  B,  and  C  described  above.    A  10-page \nsummary of the interim report will be prepared in Chinese. \n \n14.  The draft final report will document all findings and recommendations of the TA.  It will \nbe accompanied by a summary report (maximum 20 pages).  Both will be translated into \nChinese.  The final report will be completed after comments are received from NDRC and ADB.  \n \n15.  The PRC\u2013ADB urban strategy will be a stand-alone document and will be translated into \nChinese.   \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051216093536+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051128151726+08'00'", "Title": "Study on Sustainable \r\nUrbanization in Metropolitan Regions", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
