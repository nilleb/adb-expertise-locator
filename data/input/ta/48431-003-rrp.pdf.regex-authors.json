THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Equipping Youth for Employment Project \n(EYE).1 \n \n2.  Supporting Myanmar\u2019s transition toward a modern, market-based economy, the project \nwill strengthen the country\u2019s education and skills base, promoting inclusive growth and job \ncreation.  In  particular,  it  will  advance  national  reforms  to  realign  the  secondary  education \nsubsector (SES) and technical and vocational education and training (TVET) to Myanmar\u2019s \nevolving  workforce  needs.  EYE  will  principally  be  national  in  scope,  supporting  enhanced \npolicies  and  institutional  capacity  for  cohesive  SES  and  TVET  reforms,  as  well  as \nimplementation of SES and TVET curriculum reforms. It will also provide investments to expand \nSES and TVET access for underserved populations in areas lying on economic corridors.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale   \n3.  Myanmar\u2019s human capital challenge. Weak human capital poses a critical obstacle for \nMyanmar\u2019s development, threatening to trap the economy in a low value-added model based on \ncheap  unskilled  labor  and  natural  resource  exploitation  while  obstructing  national  poverty \nreduction  and  inclusive  growth  goals.3 Many  young  entrants  to  the  workforce  are  poorly \neducated and lack the skills needed for employment in a modern economy. In recent surveys, \nemployers consistently cite human capital as a leading barrier to business.4 More than 80% of \ndomestic and foreign-invested enterprises complain that the education system fails to provide \nthe needed soft skills (e.g., critical thinking, problem solving, and communication) and hard skills \n(e.g.,  construction  or  mechanical  skills).  Only  9%  of  firms  train  their  workers,  often  citing \nworkforce entrants as un-trainable because of a lack of foundational skills.5 Such challenges \nalso contribute to youth under-employment and undermine private sector development, as well \nas Myanmar\u2019s ability to integrate into and compete in regional and global markets.  \n \n4.  SES and TVET are at the epicenter of this human capital challenge and undermine \nprospects for balanced and inclusive growth. With progress made toward universalizing primary \neducation\u2014where government and development partner organization (DPO) resources have \nbeen concentrated\u2014SES and TVET now pose a critical choke point for the education sector \nand the flow of skills into the workplace.6 Decades of isolation and under-investment in SES and \nTVET  have  let  Myanmar  slip  increasingly  behind  regional  and  international  good  practice. \nSystem-building and quality-related reforms are urgently needed to align SES and TVET to \nmeet evolving skill needs, while addressing subsector-specific gaps.  \n \n5.  Disjoints  between  secondary  education  subsector,  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training,  and  skill  needs.  Despite  rising  education  budgets  since  2011, \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for Preparing Youth for \nthe Workplace Sector Development Program. \n3 S.

", "2 \nprolonged under-investment and policy-level gaps have left SES and TVET unable to respond \nto evolving skill needs. SES and TVET have been supply-driven and have operated in silos, \nlacking  strategic  alignment  to  ensure  they  collectively  meet  industry  skill  demands.  SES \nsupplies the largest share (half) of entrants into nonagricultural formal wage labor but remains \nfocused on preparation for higher education rather than the provision of soft skills needed for \nemployment.7 TVET has very low participation (accounting for 1% of workforce entrants), and \nmany programs are supply driven and largely theoretical (lacking engagement with industry to \nensure programs deliver the needed hard skills), with mixed results for trainee employment. \nThere is an urgent need for cohesive reforms and institutional strengthening to strategically \nalign SES and TVET to provide the skills and competencies required in a modern economy.   \n \n6.  Low  secondary  education  subsector  completion  rates  and  underlying  quality \nchallenges. Poor SES quality and low completion rates combine to leave workforce entrants \nfrom SES unprepared for work. More than 80% of youth complete primary schooling (grades 1\u2013\n5). However, Myanmar\u2019s primary\u2013secondary transition is the lowest rate in Southeast Asia, and \nthe dropout rate within lower secondary education (LSE; grades 6\u20139) is among the highest. As a \nresult, only 44% of girls and boys complete LSE, leaving the majority with bleak prospects for \nmodern sector employment.8 Upper secondary education (USE) also suffers from high dropout \nand failure rates. Two-thirds of grade 11 students fail the matriculation exam used to assess \nUSE completion, and eligibility for higher education and many TVET programs. Of the about 1.1 \nmillion new entrants to grade 1 each year, only 10% complete USE 11 years later, leaving a \n\u201cmissing  million\u201d  youth  without  access  to  many  forms  of  employment,  TVET,  or  higher \neducation. Low USE completion is the main barrier to entering higher education, which absorbs \nmore  than  90%  of  USE  graduates.  Disparities  across  geographic,  ethnic  group,  and \nsocioeconomic dimensions expand in LSE and USE. Only 37% of rural youth finish LSE, versus \n64% of urban youth. Despite relative gender parity on aggregate\u2014with females comprising \nroughly 55% of grade 11 students and 60% of matriculation exam passers in SY2015/16\u2014girls \nin poor households face particular challenges, especially in more remote areas. \n \n7.  Low  SES  completion  largely  reflects  quality-related  challenges.  Curricular  contents, \nteaching,  and  student  assessment  are  outdated  and  undermine  learning  and  workforce \noutcomes.  Weak  education  quality  and  relevance  to  employment  underlie  the  two  leading \ncauses cited for SES dropout: (i) lack of interest; and (ii) cost burdens, which rise markedly in \nSES. USE costs more per student than higher education, principally because of private tutoring \nfees, which account for half of household spending on USE and are a byproduct of rote-based \ncurriculum and assessment. The urban concentration of SES schools offering complete LSE \nand/or USE grades, lack of dorms in SES schools, and high costs of private boarding force \nmany poor rural youth to drop out after 1 or more years of substandard education in poorly \nequipped and incomplete SES schools. At the same time, among the minority of youth reaching \ngrade 11, the two-thirds matriculation exam failure rate points to weak subject mastery, and \nsuccessful graduates lack soft skills needed for employment. Finally, forthcoming reforms (to be \nsupported by EYE) to extend USE through grade 12 will help Myanmar meet the international \nnorm of 12 years of primary and secondary schooling.  \n \n8.  Narrow and weak technical and vocational education and training programs. TVET \nparticipation is extremely low, particularly among poor, rural, and/or ethnic group youth and \n                                                 \n7 Figures herein draw on (i) analysis in 12 ADB-supported reports under Myanmar\u2019s Comprehensive Education \nSector Review (www.cesrmm.org); and (ii) ADB analysis of data from the 2014 census.  \n8 For evidence on LSE\u2019s impact on employment outcomes, see C. Spohr. 2003. Formal Schooling and Workforce \nParticipation in a Rapidly Developing Economy: Evidence from \u201cCompulsory\u201d Junior High School in [Taipei,China]. \nJournal of Development Economics. 70(2).   \n ", "3 \nworkers. Only 1 in 60 youth aged 16\u201319 enroll in any form of training (versus 1 in 9 enrolled in \nhigher education), and just 0.8% of males and 0.3% of females aged 20\u201325 complete training in \nconstruction or industrial skills.9 Such figures largely reflect supply-side and structural issues. \nThe \u201cmissing million\u201d (and disadvantaged youth in particular) have been largely barred from \nTVET. Publicly provided TVET has focused on multiyear programs for USE graduates and \nprovision of diplomas for entry into higher education. There is a need to expand newly pilot-\ntested short course programs providing basic skills to disadvantaged youth, and to introduce \ntargeted stipends and/or other support to attract rural youth to TVET schools. Private TVET \nprovision is extremely limited and concentrated in affluent urban markets, and there is a lack of \npolicies to equitably expand private TVET in the medium term.   \n \n9.  Low TVET participation also reflects the low quality and relevance of TVET programs, \nwhich also depresses TVET demand and trainee employability. TVET has lacked engagement \nwith industry to identify evolving skill needs, recruit workers into TVET, and promote trainee \nemployment. Programs are often academic, with outdated curricula focused on theory and \npaper-based exams rather than on mastery of applied competencies. Underlying factors include \n(i) the lack of clear, cohesive policies for demand-driven TVET; (ii) persistent underfunding and \na dearth of modern facilities and equipment; (iii) teachers\u2019 weak practical and pedagogical skills; \nand (iv) gaps in Myanmar\u2019s nascent skill standard system. \n  \n10.  Government  reform  agenda.  The  government  recognizes  that  human  capital  is  a \nprerequisite for sustained, balanced, and inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction.10 \nFollowing prolonged under-investment, the government has redoubled efforts to strengthen the \neducation  sector,  quadrupling  the  annual  education  budget  from  FY2011  to  FY2016.  To \ndiagnose  sector  challenges  and  guide  evidence-based  planning,  the  Ministry  of  Education \n(MOE) completed a comprehensive education sector review (CESR)\u2014the first rigorous analysis \nof the sector since 1992\u2014with support from ADB and other DPOs. Based on CESR results, \nMyanmar\u2019s National Education Strategic Plan, 2016\u20132021 (NESP) provides a road map for \nreforms and a framework for increased government and DPO investments in the sector.11 \nImportantly, NESP emphasizes SES and TVET reforms to support inclusive growth and poverty \nreduction and to equip the economy to modernize and shift toward higher value-added goods \nand  services.  The  2015  National  Education  Law  provides  a  legislative  basis  for  sector \nrestructuring (including the 1-year extension of USE), other NESP reforms, and the drafting of \nlaws for TVET and other subsectors. To better align education to soft and hard skill needs, the \ngovernment has enhanced interagency coordination and established foundations for SES and \nTVET reforms. These include (i) MOE approval of a basic education curriculum framework, (ii) \nMOE and Ministry of Industry (MOI) pilot testing of competency-based modular short courses \n(CBMSCs) as a TVET modality to equip disadvantaged youth and workers with urgently needed \nskills, and (iii) progress in developing a national skill standard system. \n \n11.  Development  partner  organization  coordination.  The  education  sector  is  widely \nviewed as among the best examples of coordinated DPO support for government-led reforms in \nMyanmar, reflected in the CESR and planned support to the NESP. A joint education sector \nworking group and technical groups support government\u2013DPO dialogue and DPO coordination. \nMost DPO support focuses on primary, pre-primary, and nonformal education. ADB is the main \n                                                 \n9 Based on ADB analysis of household survey data, summarized in the Sector Assessment Summary: Education \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Females are overrepresented in training in areas such \nas computers but underrepresented in others such as industrial skills. \n10 Government of Myanmar. 2016.

ADB\u2019s experience and value-added. Since 2012, ADB has served as the main DPO \nsupporting SES and a key DPO supporting TVET. Drawing on ADB\u2019s experience supporting \nSES and TVET reforms regionally, a sequenced scale-up of ADB technical assistance (TA) has \nsupported Myanmar\u2019s CESR, capacity development, policy dialogue, and NESP formulation.12 \nADB has also supported government preparations for NESP implementation (para. 10) including \n(i) formulation of the basic education curriculum framework and preparation of forthcoming SES \ncurriculum reforms, in coordination with Japanese support for primary education curriculum \nreforms; (ii) pilot testing of CBMSCs; and (iii) development of skill standards, in cooperation with \nGermany, Switzerland, and other DPOs. \n \n13.  Alignment. EYE directly and cohesively supports the government\u2019s implementation of \nSES and TVET reforms laid out in the NESP, including transformational shifts to improve quality \nand workforce outcomes and adopt international good practice. It has been formulated in close \ndialogue with other DPOs and industry and civil society organizations. EYE will serve as the \nmain DPO project support to SES under the NESP and will complement other DPO support for \nTVET. It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 (extended \nto 2016) and the proposed country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132021.13 The project is included in \nADB\u2019s  country operations business plan  for  2016\u20132018.14 Its flexible design  and  focus on \nfundamental reforms aimed at system-building, strategic realignment of SES and TVET, and \nimproved  quality  and  relevance  will  also  lay  a  foundation  for  continued  ADB  support  as \nMyanmar\u2019s  development  context  evolves.  ADB\u2019s  2017  assistance  pipeline  includes  project \npreparatory TA for a second phase of EYE (with possible DPO cofinancing) aimed at deepening \nand broadening foundational reforms, expanding access, and advancing follow-on innovations.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  impact  will  be  education  and  skills  base  for  inclusive  growth  enhanced.  The \noutcome will be secondary education and TVET realigned to evolving labor force needs and \nequitably  expanded.  The  project  will  advance  national  reforms  laid out in the NESP,  with \nselected  access-related  initiatives  (e.g.,  civil  works)  targeting  areas  with  large  poor  and \nunderserved populations, particularly those along economic corridors.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  Output 1: Policy frameworks and capacities for cohesive, workforce-responsive \nsecondary  education  subsector  and  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nenhanced. The project will advance crosscutting reforms and institutional capacity building to \nlink SES and TVET in meeting evolving skill needs. Policy, analytical, and capacity-building \nsupport will build on sequenced ADB TA support for the CESR and formulation of the NESP, \nand will anchor subsector-specific support under outputs 2 and 3. As a first focus, the project \n                                                 \n12 The first of these TA projects has been closed and was rated highly successful: (i) ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nwill support MOE; MOI; and the Ministry of Labor, Immigration, and Population to establish \nmechanisms to better link education and training to skill demands by (i) consolidating and using \ndata on skills and employment, including consideration of gender dimensions; (ii) engaging with \nindustry to assess and address evolving labor market skill demands; and (iii) introducing new \ninitiatives such as career counseling for youth.  \n \n16.  A second focus will be to rationalize SES and TVET by (i) defining and mapping out core \nSES and TVET competencies; (ii) supporting finalization of the draft national qualifications \nframework;  (iii)  developing  and  operationalizing  a  policy  on  learning  pathways  between \nacademic education and TVET; and (iv) using geospatial mapping to prioritize underserved \nareas  for  SES  and  TVET  school  network  expansion.  A  third  focus  will  be  to  strengthen \ngovernment capacity to implement cross-cutting reforms and adjust strategies to respond to an \nevolving context by providing (i) flexible policy and capacity development support, including \nthrough policy briefs, forums, and technical and managerial capacity building for 120 central- \nand state-level MOE; MOI; and Ministry of Labor, Immigration, and Population officers; (ii) \nproject management support, including capacity building for MOE and the project management \nunit on procurement and financial management; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation support.  \n \n17.  Output 2: New secondary education subsector curriculum delivered and access \nexpanded. EYE will support NESP programs aimed at improving SES quality and relevance, \ncompletion  rates,  and  broader  learning  outcomes.  Building  on  ADB\u2019s  support  for  MOE\u2019s \nformulation of a basic education curriculum framework and its planning and technical inputs to \nforthcoming SES reforms, output 2 will principally support national reforms of SES curriculum, \npedagogy, and assessment. These reforms will refocus SES on cognitive and non-cognitive \nskills needed in a modern economy and society, and will extend SES through grade 12. EYE \nsupport for these reforms (to be phased during SY2019/20\u2013SY2022/23) will include (i) capacity \ndevelopment for MOE curriculum development teams; (ii) development, printing, and nationwide \ndistribution of new LSE and USE textbooks and teacher guides that are sensitive to gender, \nethnic, and other dimensions; (iii) annual teacher training linked to the phase in of the new \ncurricula, covering a total of 90,000 teachers (prioritizing female and ethnic group teachers); (iv) \nstudent assessment reforms to shift from rote-based exams and introduce modern formative \nand summative assessment methods; and (v) support to align pre-service teacher training to the \nnew SES curriculum and strengthen teacher deployment.  \n \n18.  Output 2 will also focus on supply- and demand-side constraints to accessing quality \neducation. To enhance equity across gender, ethnic, and other dimensions, it will support the \ndevelopment of (i) a policy on introducing SES dorms\u2014which do not yet exist in public SES \nschools\u2014to allow youth from remote villages to continue schooling, (ii) a strategy for upgrading \nincomplete SES schools to promote equity and completion of quality education, and (iii) national \ncommunication and social marketing campaigns. In addition, EYE will provide targeted support \nto increase completion rates in 48 underserved rural townships with large poor populations and \nhigh  incidence  of  dropout  in  LSE  and  USE.  The  project  will  upgrade  48  incomplete  SES \nschools, providing (i) 264 new classrooms (including laboratory and multi-use rooms); (ii) sex-\nsegregated  onsite  dorms;  (iii)  sanitary  facilities;  and  (iv)  laboratory,  library,  and  teaching \nequipment and resources. A randomized control trial study will evaluate the impact of these \ninterventions on enrolment, retention, and other education indicators in targeted townships. \nFinally, output 2 will strengthen SES policy and management through (i) capacity building for \nSES head teachers; (ii) training for subnational MOE offices to support SES reforms; and (iii) \npolicy development for and pilot testing of effective, low-cost, and equity-enhancing information \nand communication technology to support improved teaching and learning (e.g., by integrating \nmobile phone-based materials in teacher continuing professional development). More generally, \n ", "6 \noutput 2 will complement MOE\u2019s primary and secondary student stipend program (supported by \nthe World Bank and the Government of Australia), including by helping to lower the two largest \nhousehold spending components for education (private tutoring and boarding).   \n \n19.  Output  3:  New  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  programs \nintroduced and access expanded. In coordination with other DPO support, EYE will support \nTVET reforms laid out in the draft TVET law and NESP, and will directly support MOE and MOI \nimplementation of a priority NESP TVET program focused on expanding CBMSCs. Building on \npilot testing involving 5 TVET schools and 8 skill areas, EYE will expand CBMSCs to 15 TVET \nschools and 30 programs spanning an array of skills urgently needed in construction, other high \ngrowth industries, and mechanized agriculture. At least 41,000 youth and workers will attain job-\nready skills via CBMSC training, with at least 85% expected to be employed in related skill \nareas within 3 months of training. Support to develop and roll-out CBMSCs will include: (i) \ndevelopment of skill standards, competency-based curricula, and skill assessment instruments, \nin dialogue with industry representatives; (ii) related capacity building for teachers and school \nmanagers, prioritizing females; and (iii) provision of new workshop facilities, equipment, and \nmaterials, as well as dorms and toilets. To promote a broader shift toward competency-based \nTVET  in  Myanmar,  EYE  will  support  formulation  of  a  new  policy  on  establishing  TVET \ncurriculum development centers of excellence in public and/or private TVET schools. \n \n20.  EYE will also address supply- and demand-side constraints. This will include support for \n(i) operationalizing the forthcoming TVET law, including via new legislation that systematically \ncovers  public  and  private  financing  for  TVET  and  a  policy  framework  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships in TVET; (ii) social marketing, including employer outreach  to support female \nemployment in male-dominated skill areas; and (iii) establishing a policy on stipends and other \nnew measures to promote equitable access to TVET, prioritizing female and ethnic group youth. \nAs part of the rollout of CBMSCs at 15 TVET schools, EYE will pilot test a needs-based stipend \nscheme covering 17,000 particularly disadvantaged trainees, allocating at least 50% of stipends \nto females and 80% to ethnic group trainees from remote areas. Finally, EYE will enhance \nTVET management and promote a shift toward demand-driven approaches by supporting (i) the \nestablishment of a new TVET council structure that includes industry representation, (ii) new \nindustry  engagement  mechanisms  including  job  matching  and  trainee  placement,  and  (iii) \nenhanced capacity in local MOE and MOI offices to align TVET to local industry demands.   \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  In  developing  economies,  high-quality  secondary  education  and  TVET  are  vital  to \nsupport economic modernization and make growth more inclusive.16 They often yield particularly \nhigh returns for girls and disadvantaged groups, opening access to higher-paying formal sector \njobs, lowering fertility rates, and increasing investment in children\u2019s human capital. In Myanmar, \nbusinesses  consistently  identify  weak  human  capital  as  a  leading  constraint  to  growth. \nWeaknesses in SES and TVET obstruct Myanmar\u2019s transition from an economic model based \non natural resource exploitation and cheap, unskilled labor to a balanced growth path with \nprogress into higher value-added goods and services.17 Using available data, ADB estimates \nthat the wage returns to education peak in SES: completion of LSE and USE are associated \nwith rises in earnings of 24% and 18%. Reforms to improve SES quality and relevance are \nexpected to increase such returns while addressing the dearth of soft skills faced by employers, \nparticularly in modern service sectors. CBMSC programs providing industry-demanded skills will \nimprove disadvantaged youths\u2019 employability: initial tracer study results from the ADB-supported \npilot test show that trainees were rapidly hired, found more regular employment, and roughly \ndoubled their monthly income (from $49 to $102 on average). The programs will also help \naddress employers\u2019 unmet demands for hard skills in rapid-growth sectors such as construction \nand manufacturing, and help fill a gap in social protection programs.  \n \n26.  In  terms  of  fiscal  burden,  the  project-associated  incremental  costs  (investment  and \nrecurrent) have a peak value of 1.0% of the total education budget mid project and fall below \n0.2% post project, which is deemed modest and sustainable. Moreover, costs may be largely \noffset by sizeable efficiency gains from increased LSE and USE completion rates (since dropout \nconstitutes a major wastage of state investments) as well as low-cost, efficient, and evidence-\nbased models for future investments in priority areas including dorms, TVET stipends, and low-\ncost forms of information and communication technology to support teaching and learning. \n \nB.  Governance \n27.  EYE is ADB\u2019s first lending to Myanmar\u2019s education sector, but the government has a \nstrong  track  record  in  implementing  TA  projects  (para.  12),  demonstrating  cross-agency \n                                                 \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n17 ADB. 2014. Country Diagnostic Study: Myanmar\u2014Unlocking the Potential. Manila.  \n ", "9 \ncoordination and commitment to policy dialogue, transparency, and adherence to ADB rules. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  identified  important  gaps, \nprincipally antiquated (albeit accurate) systems and limited staff capacity and familiarity with \nADB procedures. Project preparatory TA will continue procurement and financial management \ncapacity building through March 2017, and the project will provide further support throughout \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and MOE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.18 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Poverty. Low human capital represents a poverty trap in Myanmar. Poor youth are \nmuch  less  likely  to  complete  secondary  education  or  TVET,  confining  them  to  low-paying \nunskilled labor.19 Reforms supported by all three outputs will particularly benefit the poor, e.g., \ncurriculum and policy reforms to introduce free dorms are expected to reduce private tutoring \nand boarding costs, which account for five-sixths of household spending on USE. Nationwide \nand geographically focused interventions directly or indirectly promote equity.20 These will (i) \nintroduce school network mapping to target resources to poor and underserved areas; (ii) \nupgrade incomplete rural secondary schools and pilot test free dorms, prioritizing use by poor \ngirls and ethnic group students; (iii) introduce TVET short courses for disadvantaged youth, with \nneeds-targeted stipends and free boarding for the poorest trainees, prioritizing female and \nethnic group youth; (iv) reform SES and TVET curriculum, teaching, and exams to promote \nequitable learning and workforce outcomes; and (v) provide textbooks free of charge.  \n \n29.  Gender. Despite gender equity on aggregate, analysis points to important issues and \nlinkages  between  gender  and  socioeconomic  dimensions.  For  example,  LSE  and  TVET \ncompletion rates are lowest for girls from poor households (though girls outperform boys in \nUSE).21 Quality-related reforms also need to address gender issues. SES textbooks reinforce \ngender norms, while weak SES and TVET relevance to labor force skill needs undermines male \nand especially female workforce outcomes; only 25% of females aged 20 to 30 are formally \nemployed versus 45% of males. Remedial measures in the gender action plan include ensuring \n(i) skill needs analysis and industry engagement support strategies increase female participation \nin formal employment, (ii) new SES and TVET curriculum materials are gender-sensitive, (iii) \nfemales comprise at least 70% of SES teachers trained and 50% of TVET teachers trained, (iv) \nnew SES and TVET dorms reserve at least 50% of slots for females, and (v) females constitute \nat least 40% of all CBMSC trainees and 50% of CBMSC stipend beneficiaries.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as category \nC for involuntary settlement, as it will not entail involuntary resettlement. The project is classified \nas category B for environment and indigenous peoples (termed \u201cethnic groups\u201d in Myanmar). \nCivil works will be minor in scope and restricted to existing school sites, and will have minor \nenvironmental impacts, primarily modest health and safety risks to students during classroom \n                                                 \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Gender Action Plan, and Indigenous Peoples Plan: Ethnic Group \nPlan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Geographic Information System Analysis and Targeting of Geographically Focused Initiatives (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n21 ADB, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Population Fund, and United Nations Women. \n2016.

An  initial  environmental  examination  sets  out  mitigation  and  monitoring \nmeasures.22 Improved access, learning, and employment outcomes are expected to particularly \nbenefit  ethnic  group  youth.  The  ethnic  group  plan  ensures  that  (i)  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment, school network mapping, and monitoring and evaluation include ethnic group \ndimensions; (ii) the new national SES curriculum and SES and TVET learning materials are \nsensitive to ethnic group dimensions; (iii) ethnic group teachers receive preferential access to \nin-service training; and (iv) 80% of TVET stipends are reserved for disadvantaged ethnic group \nyouth, who will also be prioritized for SES and TVET dorm support.   \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The overall project risk is assessed as medium, and integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Potential  risks  relate  to  (i)  faltering  government  reform \ncommitment  or  coordination  across  agencies  and  with  industry;  (ii)  non-responsiveness  of \ndemand for secondary education and TVET to enhanced quality and relevance and to other \nmeasures;  and  (iii)  gaps  in  national  procurement  and  financial  management  systems  and \nrelated staff capacity, weak mechanisms for deterring corruption, and firms\u2019 low familiarity with \nbidding requirements.23 These will be mitigated through (i) the project\u2019s direct support to the \nNESP  and  reinforcement  of  NESP  coordination  structures;  (ii)  communication  and  social \nmarketing initiatives; and (iii) support from dedicated consultants in a project management unit \nresponsible for procurement and financial management, which will use ADB procedures.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n32.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  \n \n33.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. Additionally, no project disbursement shall be made prior to \nMOE staff completion of training on ADB disbursement procedures, and no disbursement for \ntrainee stipends (para. 20) shall be made prior to MOE approval of guidelines for this program.   \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR70,802,000 to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the \nEquipping Youth for Employment Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to \nthe Board.   \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 November 2016  \n                                                 \n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n \nEducation and skills base for inclusive growth enhanced (Economic Policy of the Union of Myanmar)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nb\nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines   Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:     \nSecondary  a.
