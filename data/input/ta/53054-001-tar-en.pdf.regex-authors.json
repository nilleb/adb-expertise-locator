INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will promote renewable energy, \nimprove power grid stability, and support Mongolia\u2019s energy policy through studies to transform \nthe existing national power grid to a smart grid using innovative technologies and practices.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021 of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 The TA is aligned with Mongolia\u2019s Mid-term National Energy \nPolicy (2018\u20132023).3 The TA will support the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to \nmitigate climate change impacts and enhance environmental sustainability.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Government of Mongolia\u2019s target for renewable energy as a share of total energy \ngeneration is 20% by 2023 and 30% by 2030 (footnote 3). The target is in line with the submitted \nNationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement to reduce national greenhouse \ngas  emissions  and  mitigate  climate  change.5 To  achieve  its  targets,  the  government  has \nrequested ADB to support a study on grid modernization using innovative technologies and \nsolutions. ADB's Strategy 2030 supports using innovative technologies to tackle climate change. \n \n4.  The country's electricity management system (EMS) was installed in 2006 but has limited \ncapability to implement timely dispatch of power and wholesale market financial settlement among \npower supply entities (power generation, transmission, and distribution companies) and large-\nscale  consumers.  Its  supervisory  control  and data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system,  which  the \nNational Dispatching Center (NDC) uses to monitor and control the energy grid, covers a limited \nnumber of substations and is segmented by region. \n \n5.  Furthermore, because Mongolia is a vast and sparsely populated landlocked country, the \ncountry's power transmission lines generally stretch long distances, exposing the grid to stability \nrisks. The country\u2019s large load centers are in the north, while the best wind power resources are \nin the south. Developing wind power generators with fluctuating output far from load centers would \nincrease the risk of voltage instability. \n \n6.  NDC is Mongolia\u2019s national power system operator and the owner of the existing EMS. \nNDC finds it challenging to maintain  power grid stability when output from fluctuating and \nintermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic and wind turbines, increases. \nThese constraints make it difficult for Mongolia to achieve its renewable energy share targets. \n \n \n1 According to the country\u2019s State Energy Sector Policy 2015-2030, smart energy system is expected to support \nachieving the policy targets such as the increase of energy efficiency and of renewable energy share by adopting \ninnovation and advanced technology. \n2  ADB. 2019.

When power supply and demand are imbalanced, power grids are prone to large-scale \nblackouts. Therefore, Mongolia urgently needs to establish a smart energy system that integrates \nmonitoring and control of the grid. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) adoption of innovation and advanced \ntechnology promoted, and energy sector efficiency increased; and (ii) greenhouse gas emissions \nreduced.6 The TA will have the following outcome: readiness for investments in a smart energy \nsystem using high-level technology (HLT)7 increased.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA will undertake a feasibility study on adopting a smart energy system using HLT for \nMongolia's power transmission network. \n \n10.  Output 1: Investment-ready smart energy system plan incorporating high-level \ntechnology for transmission grid developed. \n \n(i)  Assess the establishment of metering data management system (MDMS), which \nwill  upgrade  and  expand  the  existing  automatic  meter-reading  system  for \nwholesale  energy  market  and  improve  the  accuracy  and  transparency  of \ntransactions  among  power  utilities,  including  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution companies. The MDMS server will facilitate payments among power \nutilities  by  connecting  their  revenue-precision  meters  via  SCADA  and  other \nsystems. MDMS is an HLT system.    \n(ii)  Assess the impact of synchro-phasor-based wide area monitoring system (WAMS) \nthat would expedite the restoration of power supply from the wide-spread blackout \nand reduce the possibility of future blackouts. WAMS is an HLT system.9 \n(iii)  Propose a plan to expand the SCADA network  from the central energy system \n(CES)  to  the  other  regional  energy  systems.  NDC  will  establish  regional \ndispatching centers (RDCs) in the western, eastern, and southern regions to \nsupplement the NDC. Recommend upgrades for the EMS to meet the evolving \nneeds of the energy sector, and recommend the establishment of a backup control \ncenter and measures to counter cyber-security risk. \n(iv)  Design the scope of work for RDCs. \n(v)  Assess if existing policy and market related to grid flexibility need any modification \nto adopt the proposed smart energy system. \n(vi)  Prepare a feasibility study report that contains an Action Plan of Smart Energy for \nMongolia (2020\u20132025) and an investment plan of smart energy system based on \nthe above findings.  \n(vii)  Prepare a due diligence report on the prioritized smart energy project which will be \nidentified during the feasibility study. \n \n6  Government of Mongolia. 2015.

Output 2: Capacity of National Dispatching Center to manage smart energy system \nenhanced. \n \n(i)  The TA will support hands-on training for NDC staff on the use of HLT such as MDMS, \nWAMS, and other smart energy technologies and practices. Capacity building would \nprovide training of analysys of major events in the power system like cascading \nblackout, voltage stability, and harmonized protection relay settings, using analytical \ntool like DigSilent. The capacity building would also provide training on the assessment \nof suitable policy and the market design for the power system flexibility as well as \nproposed wholesale electricity market settlement practices using the recommended \nMDMS. The consultant will organize an international study tour to build the capacity of \nexecuting agency and implementing agency staff, focusing on HLT. \n(ii)  Organize domestic workshops to disseminate the study findings to energy sector \nstakeholders, including the Ministry of Energy (MOE), inviting resource persons for \nknowledge transfer of international best practice. \n(iii)  Explore measures to engage more female staff with smart energy system at the NDC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.8 million, of which (i) $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the High-Level Technology Fund (HLTF);10 (ii) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund (ACEF)11 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility (CEFPF), both to be administered by ADB; The government will provide counterpart \nbalance in-kind contributions (para15). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  Eligible HLTF expenditures include but are not limited to consulting services, goods, \nworks,  and  plants  for  project  identification  and  development,  project  preparation,  project \nimplementation,  and  operation  (including  activities  such  as  survey,  conference,  seminars, \nworkshops, travel, per diem, remuneration, resource person, report, communication, publications, \npilot activities, capacity development, and research and policy advice activities related to HLT \nprojects). The eligibility of knowledge transfer activities in a country outside of the recipient \ndeveloping member country is subject to consultation with the donors committee and will be \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis.12 \n \n14.  For the ACEF under the CEFPF, eligible expenditures include consulting services, training \nand workshops, and equipment. The following expenditures are not eligible: (i) vehicle purchases, \n(ii) salaries for civil servants, (iii) scholarships or internships, (iv) civil works and other related \nexpenses, and (v) foreign training or study tour.13 \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, information and documents relevant for \nthe implementation of the TA, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n \n10 Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n11 Established by the Government of Japan. \n12 ADB. 2017.
