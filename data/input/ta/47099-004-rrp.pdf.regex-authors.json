THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan, and (ii) a proposed policy-based grant, both to the Republic of Tajikistan for \nsubprogram 2 of the Investment Climate Reforms Program.1 \n \n2.  The subprogram provides budget support for the expansion of economic opportunities \nand development of the private sector. It includes policy actions to (i) reduce the cost of doing \nbusiness, (ii) strengthen protection for businesses, and (iii) increase business innovation and \nproductivity. 2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of  Directors  approved  the \nprogrammatic approach and subprogram 1 on 4 December 2015.3  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale4 \n \n3.  Tajikistan  faces  economic  challenges  and  a  tight  fiscal  situation.  Although \nTajikistan\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 6.8% from 2005 to \n2015, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks because of its narrow export base \nand its extremely high dependence on remittance inflows, which represented an average of \n46% of GDP in 2010\u20132013. With the onset of the recession in the Russian Federation, and \nlowering export demand from its main trading partners, GDP growth moderated from 6.7% in \n2014 to 6.0% in 2015 and is expected to drop to 4.3% in 2016. Plummeting remittance inflows, \nwhich in 2015 declined in dollar terms by 33% prompted a 35% depreciation of the somoni \nagainst the dollar since November 2014. Declining import tax revenues and increases in capital \nexpenditures, wages, and pensions resulted in a surging budget deficit (including the public \ninvestment program) that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates at 4.3% of GDP in \n2016 from 2.3% in 2015. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio increased from 27.8% in 2015 to 35.9% in \nmid-2016 and is expected to further increase as the fiscal cost of banking system restructuring \nmaterializes and in the absence of future full-grant assistance from multilateral development \nbanks. The construction of the $3.9 billion Rogun hydroelectric project (almost 50% of GDP) will \nadd further pressure on external debt. As a result, the government recognized that strong fiscal \nconsolidation is necessary in the medium term emphasizing strict expenditure prioritization and \nbetter management of scarce resources. \n \n4.  The banking system\u2019s solvency deteriorated significantly since 2014. The currency \ndepreciation had a severe impact on the quality of the highly dollarized bank loan portfolio, \nwhich represented 63% of total loans in August 2016. In addition, systemically important banks \ncarry  nonperforming  legacy  assets  originating  from  government-directed  credit  programs. \nNonperforming loans (past due loans exceeding 30 days) deteriorated from 16% of total loans in \nDecember 2013 to 55% in September 2016, adversely affecting the profitability and solvency of \nthe banking system. The reported average capital adequacy is now substantially short of the \nregulatory minimum requirement. In addition, banks are facing liquidity shortages, which have \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided policy and advisory technical assistance for investment climate \nreforms (TA 8557-TAJ, approved on 13 December 2013). \n3  ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach and Policy-Based Loan and Grant for Subprogram 1 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Investment \nClimate Reforms Program. Manila. \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). ", "2 \nprevented clients to withdraw their deposits.5 The government recognized that decisive actions \nare needed to restore liquidity and solvency in the banking system, including a new strong bank \nresolution framework, independent reviews of the financial position of the five systemically \nimportant banks, and a clear fiscal strategy for responsible bank restructuring to mitigate the \nassociated large fiscal risks. \n \n5.  Substantial  improvements  in  poverty,  yet  high  rural  poverty  prevails  and  job \nopportunities are limited. Tajikistan remains the poorest country in the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States, with the lowest per capita gross national income ($1,240 in 2015, following \nthe Atlas method). The majority of people still live in rural districts. Rural poverty incidence \nremains high with the rural poor representing more than two thirds of total poor, or 40% of the \nrural population. Limited job opportunities forced about 40% of the working population to seek \nseasonal jobs abroad, mostly in the Russian Federation. The government estimates that in \n2015, 135,000 of the 1 million migrant workers in the Russian Federation returned to Tajikistan \nbecause of stricter immigration requirements and the downturn in the Russian economy. In \n2015 it is estimated that more than 330,000 migrants were given 3\u20135 years re-entry bans by the \nRussian Federation, further increasing pressure to absorb returning migrants into the economy. \n \n6.  Tajikistan\u2019s  economy  remains  poorly  diversified,  and  has  not  achieved  the  level  of \nstructural transformation that has taken place in other Commonwealth of Independent States \ncountries. The economy has remained largely agrarian, with the agriculture sector absorbing \n66% of the labor force.6 Until 2014, strong remittance inflows supported the appreciation of the \nreal effective exchange rate, reducing export competitiveness. The number of products exported \nwith comparative advantage declined from an average of 158 in 2011\u20132014 to 131 in 2015. \nTajikistan\u2019s economy is highly reliant on external factors, such as the Russian economy and \ninternational markets for key export commodities: aluminum, several ores, and cotton. \n \n7.  Development problem. Many of the structural shortcomings in Tajikistan\u2019s economy\u2014\nlow  competitiveness  of products  in  particular\u2014reflect  the  limited  progress  in  expanding  its \nproductive capabilities and in tapping economic opportunities that create more wealth. This is \nreflected in low levels of private investment, which were 5% of GDP during 2005\u20132013, one of \nthe lowest levels in the world.7 This limits future economic growth and job creation. \n \n8.  Binding constraints to private investment include an unfavorable business environment, \nunreliable access to electricity (particularly during the winter), poor transport connectivity with \nexternal markets, and limited integration with global sources of knowledge. Since 2016, access \nto finance has particularly emerged as a binding constraint, given the credit crunch associated \nwith the deteriorating solvency and liquidity in the banking sector (para. 12). \n \n9.  Private investment remains constrained by an unfavorable business environment that \nimposes  high  uncertainty  for  businesses.  Arbitrary  taxation  and  inspections  reduce  the \nprospects of fair competition and return on investments. Attempts since 2006to introduce risk-\nbased inspections have failed. Tax authorities increased the share of businesses inspected from \n51% in 2012 to 58% in 2014, and from 57% to 73% for individual  entrepreneurs.  Strong \nperceptions of expropriation risks and corruption discourage businesses and investors from \ninvesting in Tajikistan. The judiciary\u2019s ability to enforce contracts and protect investor rights is \n                                                \n5  The affected banks are insolvent and include Agroinvestbank, Tajprombank, and Tojiksodirotbank. \n6  ADB. 2016. Tajikistan: Promoting Export Diversification and Growth\u2013Country Diagnostic Study. Manila. \n7  Total investment (gross fixed capital formation) is also relatively low, averaging 16% of GDP during 2005\u20132013. \nInvestment is largely funded by the government and development partners. ", "3 \nuncertain. Laws and regulations are often inaccessible, creating uncertainty among businesses \nand investors and providing the basis for extortion by inspectors. Overall, Tajikistan\u2019s country \nrisk is very high, resulting in very low foreign direct investment, which dropped from 9% of GDP \nduring 2004\u20132008 to 1% of GDP during 2009\u20132014.8 \n \n10.  Poor  infrastructure.  Tajikistan\u2019s  landlocked  location,  poor  transport  and  logistics \ninfrastructure,  and  restrictive  regional  transit  arrangements  limit  businesses  in  accessing \nexternal  markets.  Energy  supply  is  unreliable  and  large  parts  of  the  country  lack  stable \nelectricity supply during the winter. In 2016, Tajikistan ranked 173rd out of 190 economies on \nthe ease of getting electricity.9 Firms are reluctant to invest in new equipment and automated \nproduction if they cannot access a stable and affordable supply of electricity. Existing indirect \n(tariff-based) cross-customer energy subsidies distort both the pricing structure and market \ncompetition to the disadvantage of businesses. \n \n11.  Limited integration with global sources of knowledge. In 2015, only 13.8% of firms \nreport having an internationally recognized quality certification. Tajikistan ranks 118th out of \n138 countries in cluster development.10 This mostly reflects low levels of human capital and \ninvestment,  but  is  also  related  to  institutional  constraints:  the  same  government  agency\u2014\nTajikstandard\u2014sets  technical  regulations  and  certifies  product  quality,  which  is  prone  to \nconflicts of interest and can undermine efforts to improve product quality. \n \n12.  The  banking  crisis  has  exacerbated  limited  access  to  finance,  reducing  investors\u2019 \ncapacity to expand and compete internationally. The rapid expansion of credit to the private \nsector in 2013\u20132015 was brought to a sudden stop by the somoni depreciation observed since \nend-2014. Deposit flight, particularly in local currency, has forced a decline of 6.4% of credit to \nthe economy in the first 8 months of 2016. The lack of affordable local currency financing \nremains a problem. Bank lending rates are high, at 25% per annum on average, but can reach \nmore than 40% per annum. \n \n13.  Institutional constraints. The governance and capacity of institutions have improved \nover the last decade (scored 4.4 in 2016 on a 1.0\u20137.0 scale, up from 3.4 in 2006), but remain \nweak. The performance of institutions and markets is undermined by corruption, bureaucracy, \nrelated party transactions, poor performance of boards, and lack of qualified staff. Tajikistan \nscored 26 out of 100 in Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception index, where 0 is \nhighly corrupt and 100 very clean. Most policy decisions, including on some public investments, \nare made without comprehensive public scrutiny and analysis of their economic and social \nimpacts.  Executive  bodies  often  lack  in-depth  understanding  of  policy  concepts  and \nimplementation methods, limiting the effectiveness of policy decisions. \n \n14.  The program is aligned with the government\u2019s national development strategy for \n2016\u20132030.11 The strategy prioritizes the creation of jobs through increased private investment, \neconomic  diversification,  and  competitiveness.  The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  2016\u20132020,  which  supports  reforms  to  achieve  economic  stability, \nimprove the investment climate, diversify the economy, and increase competitiveness.12 \n                                                \n8  Tajikistan has the highest country risk classification under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment\u2019s Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits (7 out of 7). \n9  World Bank. 2016.

The ADB policy-based loan provides incentives for government reforms that otherwise \nwould be delayed or not implemented. In addition, ADB technical assistance is advising the \ngovernment  on  the  design  and  implementation  of  policies  and  solutions  to  improve  the \ninvestment climate (footnote 2). Such support is important because vested interests resist policy \nchanges.  ADB  is  investing  in  energy  and  transport  infrastructure  through  other  projects. \nSubprogram  2  benefited  from  the  collaboration  with  development  partners,  particularly  the \nWorld Bank Group and German development cooperation through KfW.13 The government is \ndiscussing a possible IMF program that includes reforms to address the banking system risks, \nstrengthen the financial sector, and ensure debt sustainability in the medium-term through an \nappropriate fiscal framework. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is also \ndiscussing possible assistance to the banking system. The conditions for effectiveness of ADB \nfinancing support the improvement of the macroeconomic framework and were designed in \ncoordination with these partners\u2014particularly the IMF\u2014and the government. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The impact is aligned with increased private investment, economic diversification, and \ncompetitiveness. The outcome will be increased capabilities and opportunities of businesses to \nset up and expand higher value-added production. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  Subprogram 2 includes 13 policy actions (instead of 10 originally planned indicative \npolicy actions) that further deliver three outputs approved under the program: (i) reduced cost of \ndoing  business,  (ii)  strengthened  protection  for  businesses,  and  (iii)  increased  business \ninnovation and productivity. Subprogram 3 has 12 indicative policy actions. \n \n18.  Output 1: Reduced cost of doing business. The objective is to reduce the cost of \nregulatory compliance for businesses operating in Tajikistan. In subprogram 1, the government \nenacted the Law on Inspections of Business Activities, 2016 that approved a new mechanism \nfor coordination and reporting of annual inspection plans for agencies conducting inspections. In \nsubprogram 2, the government will eliminate business inspection powers from eight government \nbodies and this reduction will continue under subprogram 3. \n \n19.  Under subprogram 2, the government modified the rules for calculation of profit tax to \nlower the tax burden on businesses. The government and the Tax Committee also introduced \ndisciplinary measures and conducted a nationwide awareness campaign on taxpayers\u2019 rights to \nlimit predatory practices of tax officers and unlawful advance tax payments. A tax filing system \nintroduced under subprogram 1 helped increase the number of taxpayers filing electronically to \nmore than 33,000 (compared with 6,500 taxpayers at the end of 2014), exceeding expectations. \nThe government has raised the goal for the end of the program to 50,000 taxpayers using \nelectronic filing (about 11% of registered taxpayers). \n \n20.  To fulfill Tajikistan\u2019s commitment under the World Trade Organization, the government \nhas eliminated outdated technical regulations that impose unnecessary costs to businesses. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government disclosed the full list of existing provisional technical \nregulations and removed 103 outdated regulations. During subprogram 2, the government will \nremove an additional 363 outdated technical regulations. Subprogram 3 will eliminate redundant \n                                                \n13 ADB interventions and other development partner activities are listed in Development Coordination (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "5 \ndocumentation that imposes unnecessary costs to key exports. \n \n21.  Under subprogram 1, the government approved an improved regulatory impact analysis \n(RIA)  system  for  newly  proposed  legal  acts.  Under  subprogram  2,  two  pilot  RIAs  were \ncompleted:  on  improving  access  to  finance  and  improving  food  safety  through  technical \nregulations. In addition, the government will submit to the Parliament the amendments to the \nlaw on normative acts to introduce RIA in the rule-making process under the oversight of the \nNational Legislation Center. Under subprogram 3, the government will roll out the new RIA \nsystem and publish RIA results on a new government web portal. The National Legislation \nCenter will be responsible for quality review of the RIA system.  \n \n22.  Output  2:  Strengthened  protection  for  businesses. The  objective  is  to  increase \ntransparency and reduce expropriation risks for businesses. Under subprogram 1, the Tax \nCommittee  introduced  public  disclosure  of  information  related  to  legal  entities  (including \nownership, management, economic activity, capital, and contacts). Under subprogram 2, the \ngovernment completed the preparation of a web portal that will provide universal and free \naccess to the official database of normative legal documents. The government also disclosed \ngender-disaggregated statistics of business ownership to help identify and address the needs of \nbusinesswomen. Subprogram 3 will improve disclosure further to remove regulatory uncertainty.  \n \n23.  Under subprogram 1, the government enacted the Law on Investment, 2016 to ensure \nmore  transparent  and  consistent  treatment  of  incentives  to  investors  and  to  signal  the \ngovernment\u2019s  interest  in  promoting  private  investment.  The  law  establishes  the  right  to \nappropriate  compensation  in  case  of  indirect  expropriation. 14  The  State  Committee  on \nInvestments  and  State  Property  Management  (SCISPM)  is  now  in  charge  of  coordinating \nincentives to investors. Under subprogram 2, the SCISPM publicly disclosed the list of investors \nthat signed investment agreements with the government in 2014 and 2015. Under subprogram \n3, the SCISPM will approve a blueprint for its investment promotion team, including a clear long-\nterm results framework, stronger governance, internal control, and appropriate funding from the \nstate budget. The government will also approve clear rules for determining compensation in \ncase of expropriation. \n \n24.  Output  3:  Increased  business  innovation  and  productivity.  The  objective  is  to \nimprove the productivity of businesses operating in Tajikistan. On 1 January 2017, the new cost-\nbased tariff policy for electricity that gradually eliminates indirect cross customer subsidies will \nbecome effective, together with an initial increase in tariffs for highly subsidized customer \nsegments including water pumps, irrigation pumping stations, and government institutions. To \nensure  affordability  of  tariff  increases  for  low-income  customers,  the  2017  state  budget \nincreases  the  allocation  for  subsidies  under  the  Targeted  Social  Assistance  Program. \nSubprogram 3 includes measures for improved collection of payments for electricity to improve \nthe sector\u2019s sustainability. \n \n25.  Under subprogram 1, with ADB assistance, the government revised the structure of \nTajikstandard in line with its commitments under accession to the World Trade Organization, \nand transferred its accreditation functions to the new National Accreditation Center. The center \nhas  an  appropriate  governance  structure,  with  a  supervisory  board  that  includes  some \nindependent members, and will become fully independent of Tajikstandard on 1 January 2017. \n                                                \n14 Indirect expropriation occurs when the state interferes with the use of the investor\u2019s property or its benefits, even if \nthe property is not seized and the title not affected (e.g., if government actions force an investor to flee the country, \ndeny an investor access to funds or profits, or compel the investor to sell or transfer at an unfairly low price). \n ", "6 \nUnder subprogram 3, the government will continue the restructuring of Tajikstandard. \n \n26.  To provide employment opportunities for the increasing number of returning migrant \nworkers,  under  subprogram  2  the  government  will  transfer  TJS210  million  ($26.7  million \nequivalent) to a professionally managed  microcredit refinancing fund that provides affordable \nlocal currency financing to businesses and farmers via qualified financial institutions, selected in \naccordance with commercial due diligence. The fund will help restore confidence in the rural \neconomy,  which  has  been  hit  hard  in  the  recent  crisis. The fund\u2019s  charter  provides for  a \nprofessionally  qualified  five-member  board  of  trustees,  of  which  three  are  independent. \nInternational financial institutions will nominate two members of the board of trustees and the \ngovernment  will  nominate  the  other  two  members  (that  may  not  be  related  parties).  The \ngovernment and the international financial institutions will select the independent chairperson of \nthe board of trustees. \n \n27.  The  government  also  allocated  additional  grants  for  cofinancing  of  investments  of \nbusinesses owned by women. Under subprogram 2 the Entrepreneurship Support Fund (ESF) \nintroduced  a  long-term  business  plan  with  relevant  performance  indicators  and  further \nstrengthened its accountability by disclosing its audited financial statements. The ESF will also \nappoint three independent members qualified in credit underwriting for the supervisory board. \n \n28.  Changes to subprogram 2. This subprogram includes three new actions compared \nwith its original indicative scope: (i) reduction of unnecessary inspection bodies; (ii) reduction of \nadvance tax payments; and (iii) a new TJS210 million ($26.7 million equivalent) refinancing \ncredit fund for rural businesses and farmers, which replaced the indicative action on establishing \na credit guarantee scheme for businesses owing to the government\u2019s low creditworthiness. \nThese additional actions address binding constraints that have become more prominent during \n2016,  and  bring  additional  adjustment  costs  (para. 31)  that  justify  an  increased  size  for \nsubprogram 2 from the original size of $20 million. In addition, the government has expedited \nthe completion of the policy action on electronic filing that was included in subprogram 3. Other \nmodifications include (i) deferring the publishing of the first RIA results to subprogram 3 since \nthe RIA system is not yet fully in place and the new web portal for disclosure of normative acts \nis  still  being  deployed  and  tested;  (ii) deferring  to  subprogram  3  the  strengthening  of  the \ninvestment promotion function, since priority has been given to more critical areas for the \ninvestment climate; (iii) deferring to subprogram 3 the appointment of an independent auditor to \nthe ESF, since time is required from introduction of proper accounting standards; and (iv) \ndeferring the establishment of a new national standardization body to focus the reform efforts in \nthe new accreditation system. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs15 \n \n29.  Development financing needs are substantial, particularly for social welfare expenditures \n(predominantly pensions) and capital expenditures. Social expenditures increased from 36.1% \nof the state budget in 2011 to 44.7% in 2015. ADB budget support under subprogram 1 helped \nto avoid cuts in social and capital expenditures in 2015 and 2016. \n \n30.  In  2016,  growth  is  projected  to  remain  below  potential  because  of  the  continued \nrecession in the Russian economy and weaker performance in other main trading partners. In \nJune 2016, the government cut the 2016 budget in $57 million because of lower-than-expected \nrevenues. Still, revenues in the first 9 months of 2016 were TJS390 million ($50 million) below \n                                                \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nthe target. Fiscal support is needed to prevent the reduction of critical social expenditures; \naddress demographic challenges (i.e., increased pension demand and the return of migrants); \nand finance subprogram 2. The 2017 budget allocates 41.5% of available resources (or 13.7% \nof GDP) to social expenditures. \n \n31.  The government is expected to incur adjustment costs and revenue losses from the \nimplementation of policy reforms under subprogram 2. Most of the costs will be incurred from \nincreases  in  state  budget  allocations  to  (i)  the  refinancing  credit  fund  for  financing  rural \nbusinesses and farmers; (ii) government institutions, to pay for higher electricity tariffs arising \nfrom  the  reduction  of  implicit  subsidies  in  the  tariffs;  (iii)  the  low-income  population  to \ncompensate for higher electricity costs (through the Utility Subsidy and the Targeted Social \nAssistance Program) arising from the new tariff policy;16 and (iv) the ESF for financing of \nbusinesses. The government will also incur foregone revenue costs from reduced advance tax \npayments and from strengthening of the investment incentives regime. \n \n32.  The government has requested (i) a grant not exceeding $19.24 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF]);17 and  (ii)  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR22.43 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF), both to \nhelp finance its development program, in particular subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nfinancing agreement. The government does not have access to international sovereign debt \nmarkets and is closing the remaining financing gap by reducing less critical expenditures and \nusing cash reserves. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n33.  The SCISPM is the executing agency. The implementing agencies are the Ministry of \nEconomic Development and Trade, the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources, the Ministry of \nFinance,  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan,  the  SCISPM,  the  ESF, \nTajikstandard, the Tax Committee, and the Committee for Women and Family Affairs. The \nExecutive Office of the President is overseeing program implementation. \n \n34.  Financing  proceeds  for  subprogram  2  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  to  the \nGovernment of Tajikistan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as \namended from time to time) upon compliance with all policy actions for subprogram 2 and with \nADB\u2019s satisfaction with all conditions precedent to loan and grant effectiveness. The expected \nimplementation period for subprogram 2 is January 2016\u2013June 2017. The expected closing date \nis 31 December 2017. \n  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n35.  The  program  supports  economic  growth  through  reforms  that  increase  investment \nopportunities and improve the capabilities of firms to set up and improve value addition. The \n                                                \n16  The Targeted Social Assistance Program provides an unconditional cash benefit to eligible low-income households \nselected using a centrally administered proxy means test. \n17  A country\u2019s eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. \nThe latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Tajikistan had a moderate risk of debt distress and was, \ntherefore, eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n ", "8 \nreforms  are  expected  to  help  firms  in  Tajikistan  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business,  thus \nincreasing  their  expected  returns.  The  primary  beneficiaries  are  current  and  future \nentrepreneurs (including farmers) and investors who will benefit from an improved business \nenvironment; women entrepreneurs are specifically targeted. The reforms are also expected to \nprovide indirect benefits to the working population (employed and unemployed), as investments \ncreate jobs and increase wages. Reduced regulatory costs will attract more businesses to the \nformal sector, increasing the number of formal jobs. The government is expected to incur \nadjustment  costs  and  revenue  losses  from  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms  under \nsubprogram 2 (para. 31). \n \n36.  The average small and medium-sized firm incurs costs imposed by inspections and \ncertification equivalent to 16.6% of profits.18 Reducing the high number of bodies with inspection \nfunctions  (more  than  30  in  2016)  that  do  not  monitor  relevant  risks  will  reduce  costs  for \nbusinesses,  similar  to  the  elimination  of  almost  500  outdated  technical  regulations  under \nsubprograms 1 and 2. A reduction of the coefficient for the calculation of profit tax from 1.1 to \n1.0 supported under subprogram 2 will help reduce the tax burden for businesses. Further \nexpansion of electronic tax declarations\u2014in July 2016 more than 33,000 taxpayers were using \nelectronic  declarations,  up  from  about  6,500  at  the  end  of  2014\u2014improves  transparency, \nreduces opportunities for corruption, and cuts the cost of tax compliance. RIA will improve the \nquality of decision-making and reduce unnecessary costs to businesses arising from new policy \nand regulatory proposals. \n \n37.  The increased stability in legislation, particularly taxation, provided by the new law on \ninvestment as well as the new free electronic official gazette of normative acts will reduce the \nperceived risk of corruption and expropriation, and give businesses increased confidence to \ninvest in Tajikistan. Public disclosure of gender-disaggregated statistics of business ownership \nand of incentives provided to investors on government websites increases transparency. \n \n38.  Some private businesses pay tariffs that are almost triple those paid by government \norganizations and state-owned enterprises, which successfully lobby to secure lower tariffs. The \nnew cost-based tariff policy for electricity supported by the program is expected to bring benefits \nfrom (i) additional revenues to a system that charges consumers at a rate lower than required to \nfully recover costs, and thus is not yet self-sufficient; and (ii) fairer competition for private \nbusinesses  through  a  more  even  tariff  structure.  The  reform  will  improve  the  reliability  of \nelectricity supply and increase the sustainability of the energy sector. \n \n39.  Restructuring of Tajikstandard and the creation of the National Accreditation Center will \nreduce conflicts of interest and improve the institutional framework for firms applying for product \nquality  certification  in Tajikistan. Improving  product quality  is  critical  to  reverse Tajikistan\u2019s \ndecline in international competitiveness (para. 6). \n \n40.  The local currency financing facilities supported under subprogram 2 are based on good \nbanking  principles  and  are  expected  to  improve  financing  for  capital  investments,  thereby \nhelping to increase confidence in the rural economy and secure jobs. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n41.  The government approved the Public Financial Management (PFM) Strategy, 2009\u2013\n                                                \n18 International Finance Corporation. 2009.

", "9 \n2018  to  increase  the  credibility  and  transparency  of  the  state  budget.19 However,  budget \nplanning and execution, as well as treasury accounting and financial reporting, are substandard. \nDevelopment partners continue to assist the government in addressing these weaknesses. PFM \nreform initiatives include the recent rollout of the Targeted Social Assistance Program to most \ndistricts in the country, the planned modernization of the automated financial management \nsystem, and the planned strengthening of accounting and reporting capabilities in state-owned \nenterprises. \n \n42.  An ADB procurement risk assessment showed that public procurement procedures and \npractices in the country are generally in compliance with international best practice, but issues \nand areas for improvement were identified for the transport, energy, and agriculture sectors \n(footnote 10). \n \n43.  Subprogram 2 continues to promote transparency and reduction of opportunities for \ncorruption through (i) a reduction of unnecessary government inspection of businesses; (ii) a \nnew RIA system that includes mechanisms for disclosure of newly proposed legislation; and \n(iii) a free, single repository for legal acts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and the SCISPM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n44.  Policy reforms are expected to have indirect medium- and long-term impacts on poverty, \nmainly through more sustainable economic growth and increased employment opportunities. \nPrivate investment is expected to increase because of the reduced cost of doing business, a \nmore transparent tax regime, better investor protection, improved access to electricity, and \nimproved availability of local currency funding for businesses. Reduced regulatory costs are \nexpected to attract businesses to the formal sector and increase formal jobs; improved business \nproductivity should increase profits and wages. \n \n45.  The  program  promotes  equal  opportunities  for  male  and  female  entrepreneurs  by \naddressing obstacles faced in particular by women entrepreneurs. Under subprogram 2, the \ngovernment provided additional funds to businesses led by women for cofinancing investments, \nand disclosed gender-disaggregated data on women entrepreneurship. The program continues \nto monitor the share of women among entrepreneurs (estimated to be about one third in 2015), \nthe number of women entrepreneurs that receive government financing for investments, and the \nnumber of female taxpayers filing electronic declarations. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n46.  Subprogram  2  is  unlikely  to  have  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment,  require \ninvoluntary resettlement, or affect indigenous peoples. It is categorized C for each of these \nsafeguard areas.20 ADB consulted with private businesses and business associations regarding \nthe program design and implementation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n47.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \n                                                \n19 President of the Republic of Tajikistan. 2008.

ADB conditions for loan and grant effectiveness (para. 49) aim to  \nimprove an understanding of risks in the banking sector and improving debt sustainability. \nNonetheless, private investment will likely remain constrained by lower remittance inflows and \nby the banking crisis. High corruption and expropriation risks are likely to discourage private \ninvestments,  although  the  program  includes  measures  that  promote  transparency  and \ndiscourages corrupt practices (para. 43). The PFM systems are weak, although fiduciary risks \nare being addressed (para. 41). The program\u2019s overall risk is high, but the government has \nmitigating measures in place. Subprogram 2\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n48.  The  government  and  the  SCISPM  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of \nsubprogram  2  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the financing agreement. \n \n49.  To mitigate the fiscal and banking system risks, the ADB financing for subprogram 2 will \nhave  the  following  conditions  to  effectiveness:  (i)  the  government  has  completed,  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  asset  quality  reviews  of  the  five  largest  banks  (Agroinvestbank, \nAmonatbank, Eskhata, Orien, and Tojiksodirotbank); and (ii) the government has adopted, to \nthe satisfaction of ADB, a fiscal strategy that will credibly reduce the budget deficit, including the \npublic investment program, to 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and assure that the budget deficit in 2018 \nand 2019 is consistent with debt sustainability.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n50.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan and policy-based grant would comply \nwith the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR22,433,000 to the Republic of \nTajikistan for subprogram 2 of the Investment Climate Reforms Program, from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources (Asian  Development  Fund),  with  an  interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft financing agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $19,240,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan, from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, for the Investment Climate Reforms Program, on terms \nand conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n1 December 2016 \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
