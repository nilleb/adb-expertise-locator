THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Climate Resilient Inclusive Infrastructure for Ethnic \nMinorities Project I (CRIEM I). The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant \nto be provided by the High-Level Technology Fund (HLT Fund) for CRIEM I, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the grant.1 \n \n2.  Low-quality and fragmented basic transport and water resource infrastructure impede \neconomic inclusiveness in Binh Dinh Province (BDP) and Quang Nam Province (QNP) in the \nsouth\u2013central coastal region of Viet Nam, especially those districts in the remote upland with large \nethnic minority communities (EMCs), resulting in growing inequity and decreasing business \ncompetitiveness. In addition, increasing exposure to disasters and climate change is threatening \nlivelihoods and resulting in high costs for the reconstruction and adaptation of infrastructure. The \nproject will upgrade transport and water resource infrastructure and improve access to reliable \nweather and climate data in nine interior upland districts in BDP and QNP that have high \nconcentrations of EMCs.2 The project will directly promote inclusive socioeconomic growth for \nabout 243,000 people, including 126,300 from ethnic minorities. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Viet Nam\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged \n7% from 2016 to 2018 and is considered high by international standards. While Viet Nam has \nbeen managing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic effectively, its GDP growth fell to \n2.9% in 2020 from the originally anticipated 4.8%\u20136.8%. It is expected to rebound to 6.7% in \n2021.3 Both BDP and QNP rely heavily on agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, which contributed \n24% to BDP\u2019s economy and 15% to QNP\u2019s economy.4 From 2010 to 2018, the GDP growth \naveraged 7.4% per annum in BDP and 17.4% in QNP. High annual growth rates were also \nreported for road freight (from 6% to 17%) and passenger traffic (from 6% to 14%) during the \nsame period. QNP\u2019s economic growth has been highly influenced by its proximity to Da Nang\u2019s \ndeep seaport.5 In BDP, the Quy Nhon port provides access to seaports that serve the export \ntrade.  BDP  also  has  access  to  the  central  highlands  and  their  resource-based  industries, \nespecially acacia wood chips. Coastal districts of BDP and QNP that are linked to industrial zones \nand tourism, especially in Da Nang, Hoi An, and Quy Nhon, have experienced faster growth than \nthe remote interior upland districts. Tourism-related employment in the south\u2013central coastal \nregion, including BDP and QNP, supported about 400,000 jobs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic \nand is expected to drive the movement of labor from the uplands to coastal cities.6 \n \n \n1  The HLT Fund is financed by the Government of Japan and is administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2  The total population of BDP and QNP is 3.1 million, 6% of which belong to EMCs. In the nine project districts of An \nLao, Hoai Nhon, Van Canh, and Vinh Thanh in BDP, and Bac Tra My, Nam Tra My, Nam Giang, Phuc Son, and Tay \nGiang in QNP, an average of about 45% of the population belongs to EMCs. \n3  Asian Development Bank. 2021.

Binh Dinh; Quang Nam Statistics Office. \n2017. Quang Nam Statistical Yearbook, 2017. Quang Nam. \n5  Da Nang is a municipality bordering QNP. \n6  The south\u2013central coastal region is a major destination for national visitors. Pre-pandemic estimates predicted that \nthe number of jobs supported by the tourism-related employment would reach 700,000 by 2030. \n \n ", " \n2 \n4.  Poverty remains high among ethnic minorities. There is significant inequality between \nthe economically booming coastal communities and the interior upland districts that have a high \nproportion of EMCs. The majority of EMC households in BDP (87%) and QNP (55%) are classified \nas poor or near poor, against the provincial poverty rates of 5.5% and 10.3%, respectively.7 A \nprimary cause for the high level of poverty and vulnerability is EMCs\u2019 weak social and economic \nintegration, resulting from a lack of connectivity caused by poor quality transportation and long \ntravel times to coastal areas. Most EMCs are frequently isolated during the rainy season because \nthey lose access to roads that are largely routed through hilly to mountainous terrain, resulting in \n(i) more time spent by local communities to access their livelihood activities and social services, \n(ii) higher transport costs, (iii) fewer transport operators and buyers to haul local output, and \n(iv) weakened price negotiating position of local producers.  \n \n5.  Impact of poor quality transport infrastructure on livelihood activities. From 2010 to \n2017, the government encouraged the expansion of tree plantations. During this period, wood \noutput increased by 25% to 700,000 tons per year in the four BDP project districts and by 61% to \n640,000 tons per year in the five QNP project districts, and these volumes are expected to further \nincrease.8 Tree plantations, especially those for acacia trees, generate employment\u2014in BDP and \nQNP, they provide 250,000\u2013300,000 jobs for an estimated 27,000\u201335,000 households, over 75% \nof which belong to EMCs. The low quality and fragmented transport infrastructure, which leads to \nhigh transport cost, however, is resulting in lower wages. Producers of acacia and other crops, \nsuch as cassava and rubber, are faced with transport costs that range from 33% to 66% of their \nrevenue from sales to processing factories. Acacia wood in particular has low value with low profit \nmargins, due to the high haulage costs to primary processing sites. The government is also \ntransitioning the smallholder acacia plantation subsector into the Forest Stewardship Council \ncertification program,9 which requires certain social and environmental standards to be achieved \nin return for potential carbon financing benefits. The high transport cost, however, is a critical \nimpediment to meeting the standards and realizing such benefits.  \n \n6.  Unreliable water supply. Access to water is essential for both daily home usage and \neconomic activities. Limited access to water and poor sanitation and hygiene practices contribute \nto high rates of waterborne diseases and poverty. Less than 60% of project area households have \na reliable and safe year-round water supply. Most supplies are linked to mountain streams or \nsurface water systems that are experiencing decreasing water availability and quality, particularly \nduring the dry season; the result is that households must fetch water, which requires time and \neffort that is usually borne by women and children. At times, potable water must be purchased \nduring the dry season. Both project provinces prioritize investment in rural domestic water supply \n(RDWS) schemes, but the sustainability of these schemes is often problematic. \n \n7.  High risk of disasters and climate change. Viet Nam ranks high in the Global Climate \nRisk Index.10 It is estimated that Viet Nam experiences annual loss of $2.37 billion on average as \na consequence of natural hazards, especially floods.11 The south-central coastal region is one of \nthe most affected regions. Floods adversely affect local communities, especially the poor living in \nrural areas, with damage to housing, transport, and irrigation infrastructure; livelihoods dependent \non agriculture and fisheries; and access to social services. BDP and QNP are also highly \nvulnerable to tropical storms, often with significant loss of lives. Sound climate risk information is \n \n7  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8 Decision No. 886/QD-TTG dated 16 June 2017, referred as National Program 886, approved the target program for \nsustainable forestry development for the period 2016\u20132020. \n9  Forest Stewardship Council. \n10 D.

There is also \nkeen interest from the finance and insurance industry in developing risk-mitigation products. \nHowever, the current public sector climate data systems are fragmented, often poorly maintained \n(financially and physically), and inaccessible to the users. The development of improved climate-\nbased information systems to inform underlying early warning systems, infrastructure planning, \nand future risk sharing through insurance is required and investments are needed to increase the \nscope of information based on real time, reliable, and accessible data. These data will be essential \nto develop resilience measures that can support communities, especially women, in coping and \nadapting to climate change, and recovering from disasters. \n \n8.  Coronavirus disease. The proposed project will support Viet Nam with its continued \nCOVID-19 pandemic response by accelerating economic development and reducing impacts of \nthe pandemic in the project areas. The project will relieve some of the economic costs of the \npandemic by creating jobs, improving connectivity, and reducing damage and losses from climate \nevents. In the case of a potential future pandemic, the enhanced road infrastructure will support \nthe transport of food and improve access to health facilities. RDWS improvements are essential \nfor sanitation and hygiene and will contribute to better health and immune resilience. \n9.  Modality. The project meets ADB\u2019s criteria for sector modality as: (i) the project supports \nthe implementation of multisector development plans, notably the Master Plan on Socio-Economic \nDevelopment of the South-Central Coastal Region;12 (ii) the provincial peoples\u2019 committees \n(PPCs), as executing agencies, are assessed to have strong institutional capacity to implement \nthe plan with additional support from the project; and (iii) the policies and supporting regulations \nfor infrastructure sustainability will be strengthened through improved design standards and \noperational requirements.  \n10.  Strategic  alignment.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  inclusive  and \nsustainable economic growth and its Masterplan for Socio-Economic Development for Ethnic \nMinorities  and  Mountainous  Regions  2021\u20132030.13  It  is  well  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020, with its support for the three pillars: (i) promoting \njob creation and competitiveness, (ii) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service \ndelivery, and (iii) improving environmental sustainability and climate change response.14 The \nproject will also support operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).15 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Project Interventions \nAddressing remaining poverty and reducing  \u2022  Improved road connectivity, water resource development, \ninequalities  and climate information to support inclusiveness of ethnic \nminority communities \nAccelerating progress in gender equality  \u2022  Improved transport for women to access social and \neconomic opportunities \n\u2022  Improved domestic water supply that reduces women\u2019s \ndaily burden of walking long distances to collect water \n \n12 Government of Viet Nam. 2013.

Lessons learned. Lessons from previous projects include the need to (i) have efficient \nconnectivity  to  underpin  economic  growth,  business  investments,  and  competitiveness; \n(ii) employ approaches to integrate developing areas with those that are disadvantaged; (iii) have \ninclusive EMC growth paths through support for basic economic and social infrastructure to \nenhance competitiveness; (iv) ensure climate change resilience of infrastructure; and (v) focus on \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  during  project  design  to  increase  sustainability  through \nincreased technical and safeguard supervision during implementation.16 Recent experience on \npreparing projects under the government\u2019s decentralization policy has involved (i) the inclusion of \nmultiple provinces in one investment project; (ii) lengthy government project approval processes \nthat need to be followed independently by individual provinces; (iii) uneven provincial capacity to \nachieve project approvals, causing some provinces to lag behind others; and (iv) frequent \nchanges  in  government  policies  and  procedures  involving  official  development  assistance, \nleading to uncertainty. These have resulted in overall project preparation being delayed by the \nmost lagging province. Based on this experience, ADB and the government have agreed on a \nstrategy whereby the most prepared provinces are grouped together into one project for early \napproval,  with  lagging  provinces  grouped  for  later  approval,  thereby  allowing  additional \npreparation time. The proposed project has incorporated this strategy, with CRIEM I proposed for \ntwo provinces (BDP and QNP) out of the six in the originally contemplated geographic scope.17 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive socioeconomic development of \nBinh Dinh and Quang Nam provinces accelerated.18 The project will have the following outcome: \nsocial and economic status and inclusiveness of ethnic minorities communities improved.19 \n \n13.  Output  1:  Climate-resilient  transport  infrastructure  improved.

The enhanced transport network will also reduce travel time for road users \nand improve access to health, education, and market services, especially for women who suffer \nfrom time poverty. \n \n14.  Output 2: Climate-resilient water resource infrastructure improved. This output will \nsupport activities such as (i) construction of RDWS to provide water through piped networks; \n(ii) upgrading reservoirs to support irrigation command areas with a more reliable and efficient \nwater supply; and (iii) construction of infrastructure for cultural tourism.21 Activities under this \noutput will benefit about 36,300 people and improve the health of communities by reducing the \nrisk of waterborne diseases and will particularly benefit women by reducing the time they spend \nin water collection. \n \n15.  Output 3: Data systems for climate risk management updated. This output will provide \nimproved access to reliable weather and climate data in a timely and cost-effective manner. These \ndata will help strengthen early warning systems, improve disaster response, and inform a wide \nrange of decisions, including those related to the design of climate resilient infrastructure.22 High-\nlevel online technology will be introduced to improve the capacity of the provincial governments \n \nto manage, collect, archive, and share data through client interfaces.\n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n16.  Under  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic  Cooperation  Program  Strategic \nFramework, 2012\u20132022, ADB has prioritized multisector investments for regional and local \neconomic development with strong cross-sector linkages.23 Through programs such as the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Transport and Trade Facilitation Action Program, ADB has also \npromoted stronger corridor integration, connecting rural areas with economic growth hubs.24 The \nproject will complement and create synergies with ongoing initiatives financed by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners including the World Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nwhich aim to enhance rural roads and water supplies in the south-central coastal region, by \n(i) improving  the  connectivity  of  remote  upland  rural  communities  with  district  centers  and \nprocessing hubs, (ii) integrating climate change projections into the design of road and water \ninfrastructure, (iii) expanding investment in water resource infrastructure, and (iv) improving \nknowledge-based decision making through the use of climate and disaster risk data.25 \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $81.73 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \n \n21 Examples of subprojects under this output include (i) RDWS in An Lao district in BDP to provide water to about \n18,600 people through 115 km of piped networks; (ii) upgrading of an existing reservoir in Phuoc Son district in QNP \nto support 117 hectares of irrigation command area; and (iii) construction of cultural tourism infrastructure, including \none river defense (3.6 km of embankment), visitor car parking, and solid waste collection in Tay Giang district in \nQNP, with a total population of 17,700 including 94% from EMCs. \n22 The extent and type of investment will vary between the two project provinces, with consideration of the ongoing \ninvestments in QNP financed by the World Bank under the Dam Rehabilitation and Safety Project and by ADB under \nthe Urban Environment and Climate Change Adaptation Project, which is developing and implementing a flood \n \nforecasting and warning system for Hoi An and Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin.\n23 ADB. 2011.

The government will relend the ADB loan \nproceeds, and make the HLT Fund grant proceeds available, to BDP and QNP via their PPCs on \nterms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n19.  The summary financing plan is in Table 3. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ncivil works and construction supervision consultants. The HLT Fund grant will finance supply and \ninstallation of data systems for climate risk management. The government will contribute $21.73 \nmillion to the project, to finance all detailed designs, project management, land acquisition and \nresettlement  costs,  consulting  services for  loan  implementation,  taxes  and  duties,  and the \n \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 A list of candidate subprojects that are eligible for feasibility studies is in the PAM (footnote 26). \n28 The government has requested two separate loans, each in the amount of $29 million, one to be relent to BDP and \nthe other to QNP, based on their new overseas development assistance regulations. As Viet Nam is in the early \nstages of decentralized, province-based lending, two separate loans will assist the government in keeping resource \nallocations between the two provinces separate and distinct. Viet Nam also plans to use a fiscal clawback \nmechanism, which merits separate accounting for each province.  \n29 Financing partner: Government of Japan. The HLT Fund approved an application for an amount of $5 million, under \nthe originally envisaged Climate Resilient Inclusive Infrastructure for Ethnic Minorities Project, prior to the split of the \nproject into CRIEM I and CRIEM II (footnote 17).

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 26). Each PPC has assigned a professional project management unit (PPMU) \nas implementing agencies, legally registered public entities with authority to sign contracts with \nconsultants, contractors, and suppliers. The PPMUs will use existing staff and project facilities \nand be assisted by loan implementation consultants. The PPMUs have substantial existing \ncapacity in engineering, project management, and financial management, as well as growing \ncapacity  in  procurement  and  government  e-procurement  with  registered  procurement  staff. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  implementation  of  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards. The PPMUs will report through the PPCs to ADB and the central government. Using \nthe existing focal points, the BDP PPMU will provide overall coordination support to ADB for \nmissions and project communications. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2021\u2013May 2026 \nEstimated completion  31 May 2026 \ndate \nEstimated loan closing  30 November 2026 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Provincial Peoples Committees of Binh Dinh and Quang Nam Provinces \n(ii)  Executing agency  Provincial Peoples Committees of Binh Dinh and Quang Nam Provinces \n(iii) Key implementing  Binh Dinh PPMU for agricultural and rural development projects \nagencies  Quang Nam PPMU for transport construction works \n(iv) Implementation unit \u2013  Binh Dinh PPMU for agricultural and rural development projects \nPPMU  Quang Nam PPMU for transport construction works \nProcurement  OCB (nationally advertised)  12 contracts  $63.70 million \nConsulting services  FBS (HLT Fund)  2 contracts  $2.00 million  \n  QCBS (construction supervision)  2 contracts  $1.46 million  \nDisbursement  The ADB loan and HLT Fund grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FBS = fixed budget selection, HLT Fund = High-Level Technology Fund, OCB = open \ncompetitive bidding, PPMU = professional project management unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n30 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", " \n8 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The engineering and construction skills required for the project are within the capacity of \nViet Nam\u2019s private sector and the executing and implementing agencies. Feasibility studies were \nprepared for the two representative subprojects in BDP: (i) the Vinh Thanh road section, and \n(ii) the An Lao RDWS which supports two networks: (a) a small town scheme with water treatment, \nand (b) a rural commune scheme. The preliminary designs are based on projected demand up to \n2045 and ADB\u2019s guidelines for integrating climate-resilient measures into road engineering \ndesigns.31 During project preparation, the availability and types of subprojects for financing was \nexamined, and subproject eligibility and screening criteria to be following during implementation \nhave been defined. Given their previous experience with similar projects, the executing and \nimplementing agencies were assessed to have the capacity to implement a sector project.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n22.  The economic internal rate of return for the representative road subproject is estimated to \nbe 12.5% with a net present value of $4.6 million against the 9% hurdle rate.32 The representative \nroad subproject will remain viable with reductions in benefit streams of 10% or increases in capital \ncosts of 10%.33 The representative RDWS subproject has an estimated financial rate of return of \n4.7% and an economic internal rate of return of 12.3%. The viability of the representative RDWS \nsubproject requires a tariff increase to D9,910 per cubic meter for the small-town scheme with \nwater treatment and D7,671 per cubic meter for the rural commune scheme, which has been \nagreed with the BDP PPC. These tariffs are 1.4\u20131.6 times the average incremental financial cost \nof water supply and represent less than 3.2% of monthly household income even for the poorest \nhouseholds, well within the affordability benchmark and confirmed through consultations with \nbeneficiaries. Both schemes will be operated by the BDP water supply and sanitation unit which \nmanages seven rural water supply schemes and successfully generates financial surpluses. As \na government organization, the BDP water supply and sanitation unit does not have any debt and \nis  assessed  to  be  both  technically competent and  well  managed,  with  a modern financial \nmanagement system in use. Hence, incremental recurrent cost analysis of the BDP water supply \nand sanitation unit shows that they have the capacity to absorb additional O&M requirements \narising from the assets created under output 2. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n23.  For output 1, the provincial road maintenance units of the Department of Transport are \nresponsible for district and commune networks and for O&M of transport infrastructure. To \nmitigate the significant risk of road deterioration, the project will include an eligibility criterion for \nthe design of traffic loading parameters to be agreed and confirmed by PPCs to ensure that the \ndesign standards are valid throughout the roads\u2019 economic life and meet the mid-century climate \nchange projections. Based on the design decisions, quality controls, and maintenance monitoring \nsystems, the Department of Transport will be able to sustain the proposed road sections. For the \nrepresentative subproject (the Vinh Thanh road section in BDP), the estimated O&M costs of D87 \nmillion per annum will account for less than 0.05% of the annual budget allocated for O&M costs \n \n31 ADB. 2018.

Similar O&M sustainability assessments will be conducted for succeeding \nsubprojects as part of the feasibility studies and final detailed engineering design, per government \nregulations. For output 2, the executing agencies will use provincial water supply and sanitation \nunits to operate the RDWS. These units have been identified and assessed as viable in each \nprovince. The feasibility studies and detailed designs of output 2 subprojects will be specifically \nreviewed and assessed by the PPMUs to ensure that costs to households are affordable and that \ntariffs are adequate for cost recovery. Simplified assessment guidelines have been provided to \nthe respective executing agencies. For output 3, equipment and data systems include data \nstorage and software applications with limited investment in hydro-met stations. Data systems will \nbe digital, networked, and automated with low incremental operational costs. The O&M will require \nthe PPCs to allocate additional staff to work with the contracted service providers. An assessment \nof management contracts for data services, including O&M, will be undertaken by the PPCs with \nsupport from consultants where needed. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n24  Financial  management.  The financial  management risk  is moderate based  on  the \ndetailed  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  because  of  the  reliable \naccounting  software,  staffing,  accounting,  financial  reporting,  auditing,  and  internal  control \nsystems.34 Mitigation measures have been identified in the financial management action plan, \nincluding  adequate  staffing,  targeted  training,  consistent  use  of  the  project\u2019s  financial \nmanagement manual, enhanced budgeting processes, and external audit arrangements. \n \n25.  Procurement. The project will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). Procurement of civil works with individual package values of up to about $10 \nmillion are planned under the project. Value for money will be achieved by applying open \ncompetitive bidding with national advertising for all packages, given the capable and competitive \nlocal market, limited external interest, and the need to maximize domestic economic activity in \nthe aftermath of COVID-19. The use of the national e-procurement system will promote efficiency, \nfairness,  and  transparency  in  the  procurement  process,  while  using  the  single  stage,  one \nenvelope bidding procedure and the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bid evaluation \nmodality will promote economy and efficiency given the noncomplex nature of the planned works. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment. The specific policy requirements are described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The project will invest in districts that have high proportions of EMCs (on average 45%).35 \nThe EMCs are often at a disadvantage because of geographical isolation as they live in remote \ninland mountainous areas with difficult terrain, limited arable land, climatic extremes, and less-\ndeveloped physical and social infrastructure, all of which constrain livelihood opportunities. Based \non the government\u2019s multi-dimensional poverty line, the poverty rates were 5.5% in BDP and \n10.3% in QNP in 2018, compared to 6.8% nationally.36 However, the poverty rates among EMCs \nare much higher. In BDP, EMCs represent 12% of the population, with 87% considered poor or \nnear poor. In QNP, EMCs represent 6% of the population, with 55% considered poor or near poor \n(footnote 7). Ethnic minority women\u2014especially those who are middle-aged and elderly\u2014usually \n \n34 Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 The largest ethnic minority groups include the Coho, Cotu, Ede, Hre, Mnoung, Raglay, Tay, and Xo Dang. \n36 General Statistics Office. 2018. Statistical Yearbook of Viet Nam, 2018. Ha Noi. In Viet Nam, multi-dimensional \npoverty is measured through five dimensions: health care, education, housing, water and sanitation, and information \naccess. \n \n ", " \n10 \nface more language barriers compared to ethnic minority men. Even when livelihood opportunities \nexist for EMCs, the transport infrastructure is often inadequate to fulfil the potential and is \nbecoming more vulnerable to damage as a result of emerging climate change impacts. The \nproject interventions will allow EMCs to gain access to (i) resilient and safe roads for transporting \nprimary products and people; (ii) clean and reliable water supplies; and (iii) local employment that \nbuilds inclusiveness through increased mobility to services and markets. These activities will \ncontribute to substantially reduce time poverty and drudgery especially for women and girls. \n \n27.  Gender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender analysis \nrevealed that women have fewer opportunities to participate in public decision-making in the \nproject areas, mainly because women have less access to information and training, and less \nknowledge of changing road safety hazards. Women are more exposed to water-related health \nissues.37 Women are generally not encouraged to participate in training and meetings because \nof traditional gender role norms. Another key disadvantage for women\u2019s meaningful participation \nis their limited available time. Women and girls will be major beneficiaries from the proposed water \nsupply schemes through reductions in physical burdens, time spent collecting water, and health \nrisks. The project\u2019s gender action plan promotes (i) equitable participation in and benefits from \nthe  project-financed  infrastructure  and  capacity-building  activities  by  women  and  men, \n(ii) reduction of social risks and vulnerabilities for women and girls, (iii) increased representation \nof women in decision-making bodies, (iv) enhanced voice and collective action for women, and \n(v)  collection  and  use  of  sex-disaggregated  data.  The  climate  change  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement systems under output 3 will be designed to be gender responsive. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s safeguard measures, gender action plan, meaningful community consultations, \ngrievance redress procedures, and supporting implementation resources are included in the \nrepresentative subprojects' feasibility studies, which will serve as models for the feasibility studies \nfor all subsequent subprojects. ADB will only finance subprojects that are classified category B or \nC for all safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows.38  \n \n29.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework has \nbeen prepared for the project.39 The road works are limited to upgrades within the existing and \nnewly established right-of-way; adverse environmental impacts will be minor, site-specific, and \ntemporary. No subproject will infringe on protected or environmentally sensitive areas. Good \nconstruction  practices  and  standard  mitigation  measures\u2014such  as  proper  management  of \nearthworks  and  construction  camps,  soil  erosion  control,  and  proper  storage  of  building \nmaterials\u2014will be incorporated. Each initial environmental examination for the two representative \nsubprojects includes an environmental management plan with appropriate mitigation measures.40 \nWater resource subprojects will ensure that water flows are maintained and any alteration to \nreservoir storage is assessed. Provincial water supply and sanitation units will operate the RDWS \nschemes and ensure that they are financed fully by water tariffs under the national regulations.41 \n \n \n37 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n39 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 Initial Environment Examination: An Lao District Water Supply, and Initial Environmental Examination: Vinh Thanh \nRoad (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) have been publicly disclosed. \n41 Feasibility Study: An Lao District Water Supply, and Feasibility Study: Vinh Thanh Road (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", " \n11 \n30.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A combined resettlement and ethnic minority \ndevelopment framework has been prepared for the project, under which resettlement and ethnic \nminorities development plans for the two representative subprojects were prepared and publicly \ndisclosed.42 These plans are supported by public consultation and information disclosure. The \nonly resettlement impacts will be minor land acquisition and compensation for roadside trees, \ncrops, or small structures within the right-of-way. All compensation, allowances, operation and \nadministration, surveys, monitoring, and reporting will be financed by the government counterpart \nfunds. The impacts will be monitored, evaluated, and reported semiannually to ADB by the PPCs \nin accordance with the resettlement and ethnic minorities development framework. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on indigenous peoples, referred to as ethnic \nminorities in Viet Nam, are overwhelmingly positive because the subprojects aim for the economic \nand social improvement of the population in districts with the highest representation of ethnic \nminorities. The project will not cause physical displacement from traditional or customary lands, \nnor will it negatively impact the identity, culture, or customary livelihood systems of ethnic \nminorities. The resettlement and ethnic minorities development framework prioritizes the inclusion \nof ethnic minorities into economic and social opportunities through project investments. The \nresettlement and ethnic minorities development plans include mitigation measures to address \nimpacts, institutional capacity development programs, and a grievance redress mechanism; and \ncomply with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \n32.  Safe  working  under  coronavirus  disease  conditions.  The  impact  of  COVID-19 \ncontinues to evolve. The implementation of the project will be responsive and flexible in meeting \nemerging needs and new best practice in construction and water utility management. The \nexecuting and implementing agencies, loan implementation consultants, construction supervision \nconsultants, and contractors will incorporate emerging international construction best practices \nand implementation methodologies for managing COVID-19 risk, which are vital for work in \nconfined spaces where the risk of transmission is high. Such practices will also consider the \ngovernment\u2019s guidance on safe working in COVID-19 conditions. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n33.
