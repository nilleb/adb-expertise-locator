THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic  approach  for  the  Boosting  Productivity  through  Human  Capital  Development \nProgram, and (ii) a proposed policy-based loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of \nthe Boosting Productivity through Human Capital Development Program. \n \n2.  Human capital refers to the set of skills, knowledge, competencies, and other attributes \nembodied in people; and plays a key role in a country\u2019s long-run growth prospects. Its role is \nespecially relevant given the economic disruption resulting from the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19) pandemic. The program focuses on human capital development to improve labor productivity \nthat will be especially important for COVID-19 recovery. It supports reforms in education, skills \ndevelopment, health, and social assistance, within an overarching Sustainable Development Goal \n(SDG) framework and aims to achieve the key targets highlighted in Box 1. The program adopts \na programmatic approach that combines policy-based loans with technical assistance (TA) and \nknowledge support. This approach was selected as it enables the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto partner with the Government of Indonesia to pursue high-impact reforms sequentially over three \nsubprograms.  Subprogram  1  establishes the foundation  of  the program through regulatory \nreforms and pilot initiatives; subprogram 2 will focus on the implementation and expansion of \nthese reforms; and subprogram 3 will institutionalize these reforms, so that they form a permanent \npart of the national framework.  \n \nBox 1: Program Key Target Results by 2026 \n \nOn SDG financing and implementation \n\u2022  SDG index score increased to 70.0, with improvement in indicators related to health (SDG 3) and \neducation (SDG 4), from 65.3 in 2020 \n\u2022  National health insurance coverage increased to 240 million people from 223 million people in \n2020 \nOn education and skills development \n\u2022  Learning-adjusted years of schooling increased to 8.5 from 7.8 in 2020 \n\u2022  Gap between the rate of men and women who are not in employment, education, and training \nreduced to 7.5 percentage points from 11.2 percentage points in 2020 \nOn social protection and health  \n\u2022  Stunting among children under the age of 5 declined to 14% from 27.7% in 2019 \n\u2022  Out-of-pocket expenditure as a share of total health expenditure declined to 25% from 34% in 2020 \nSDG = Sustainable Development Goal. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. With the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nIndonesia\u2019s economy contracted by 2.1% in 2020\u2014for the first time since the Asian financial \ncrisis.1 Per capita gross national income declined to $3,870 and Indonesia was reclassified as a \nlower middle-income country in 2021.2 The government expects real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth of 3.7%\u20134.5% in 2021, down from its earlier outlook of 5.0%\u20135.3% primarily \n \n1  ADB. 2021. Asian Development Outlook 2021: Financing a Green and Inclusive Recovery. Manila. \n2  In 2020, Indonesia was classified as an upper middle-income country when its per capita gross national income \nreached $4,050. \n ", "2 \nbecause of the mobility restrictions put in place to stem the spike in COVID-19 infections. The \ngovernment\u2019s macroeconomic framework remains satisfactory. Given the stimulus packages to \naddress the impacts of the pandemic, the 2021 budget targets a deficit of 5.7% of GDP.3 A return \nto pre-pandemic levels of fiscal prudence is planned by 2023. With inflation remaining subdued, \nthe central bank has kept the policy rate at 3.5%, its lowest level since 2016. Public debt remains \nmoderate at about 37.0% of GDP as of end-2020 and is projected to stabilize at about 43.0% over \nthe medium term.4 The nonperforming loan ratio has inched up, while the capital adequacy ratio \nremains comfortably above the regulatory minimum.5 Notwithstanding, structural reforms will be \nimportant to stimulate economic recovery and achieve long-term national development goals. \n \n4.  Indonesia aspires to become a high-income country by 2045. Indonesia\u2019s economic \ngrowth rate has flattened at an average of 5.0% since peaking at 9.5% in 1995\u20131996, just before \nthe Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. This growth rate is high by global standards, but considerably \nlower compared with its regional peers and to the years preceding the crisis.6 For Indonesia to \nachieve high-income status by 2045, a growth rate of about 7.0% will be necessary, which will \nrequire an increase in labor productivity from its current low levels (Figure 1, Panel A). During \n1980\u20132019, labor productivity growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet Nam was \nconsiderably higher. Examining Indonesia\u2019s labor productivity and its determinants reveals that \nhuman capital in Indonesia plays a smaller role in driving productivity growth (Figure 1, Panel B). \nThis is because of the low level of human capital, in terms of quantity as well as quality. \n \nFigure 1: Labor Productivity Growth in Indonesia \nPanel A: Labor Productivity Growth, 1980\u20132019 (%)  Panel B: Drivers of Labor Productivity Growth in Indonesia, \n2019 (percentage points)  \n \n \nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nNote: Panel B includes coefficient estimates from an econometric analysis of determinants of labor productivity.

While an \nIndonesian child today can expect to complete 12.3 years of schooling by their 18th birthday, the \nchild will on average receive only 7.9 years\u2019 worth of learning because of the low quality of \neducation (Figure 2, Panel B).

The Human Capital Index (HCI) 2020. \n \n6.  Effect of COVID-19 on social indicators and human capital development. First, the \npoverty rate increased to 10.2% in 2020 from 9.2% in 2019, reversing the gains of prior years.9 \nSecond, job losses have been unprecedented, with the unemployment rate spiking to 7.1% in \n2020 from 5.3% in 2019. Women are bearing the brunt of the impact as they make up a larger \nproportion of the workforce in some of the most impacted industries such as tourism, and \nwholesale and retail.10 Third, learning outcomes have worsened because of COVID-19-related \nschool closures. Three out of four households in Indonesia were concerned about learning loss \nfor their children because of extended school closures.11 Missed schooling at an early age could \nhave a lasting impact on incomes and livelihoods. Half a year of learning loss could lead to $224.4 \nbillion in lifetime income losses across 68 million students.12 Fourth, non-COVID-19 public health \noutcomes have also deteriorated, as evidenced by a reduction in immunization rates and access \nto non-COVID-19 health care. Recent evidence shows that 1 in 10 households reported missing \nimmunization for children under the age of 5 (footnote 11). \n \n7.  Indonesia must address its human capital deficit to meet its targeted growth rate.13 \nFor example, improvements in human capital will be necessary to fully benefit from the adoption \n \n7  The World Bank\u2019s HCI measures the amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18. \nIt conveys the productivity of the next generation of workers compared with a benchmark of complete education and \nfull health.

The adoption of more sophisticated technology could add up to $2.8 trillion to the \nIndonesian economy by 2040, spurring economic growth by an additional 0.55 percentage points \nannually over the next 2 decades.14 However, even if firms wish only to imitate or implement \nexisting technologies and products, they still need a workforce with relevant skills and knowledge. \nYet,  employers  in  Indonesia  report  a  scarcity  of  workers  with  job-ready  skills,  which  is \ncompounded in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As Indonesia makes the transition to \na more knowledge-driven economy, demand for high-skilled workers will further grow. \n \n8.  Development constraints. The government has recognized these challenges and has \nidentified three key binding constraints to human capital development: (i) incomplete fiscal policies \nand monitoring tools, impeding the implementation of the SDGs; (ii) low quality and relevance of \neducation  and  training,  leaving  young  people  underprepared  for  the  labor  market;  and  \n(iii) inadequate social protection and health policies to achieve human capital development. \n \n9.  Incomplete fiscal policies and monitoring tools impede the implementation of the \nSDGs. Three key issues contribute to this binding constraint. First, the alignment between SDG \npriorities and the fiscal framework is insufficient at the subnational government level, especially \nfor health expenditures. This constraint leads to discrepancies in SDG implementation at the local \nlevel. For example, the percentage of women who gave birth in a health facility in Jakarta exceeds \n99% compared to about 40% in Maluku. Second, the SDG target on universal health coverage \nthrough the national health insurance system is at risk as the insurance scheme is in a precarious \nfiscal position and is unable to address the health inequities across Indonesia. The health \ninsurance premium rates need to be adjusted based on factors such as the payment of variable \nbenefits across different classes, the ability of beneficiaries to pay the contributions, and the fiscal \ncost to the government. Third, fiscal transfers for health are inadequate and do not include targets \nfor health expenses, leading to underspending in health programs such as on stunting prevention. \n \n10.  The  low  quality  and  relevance  of  education  and  training  leave  young  people \nunderprepared for the labor market. Four key issues contribute to this binding constraint. First, \nthe local public employment service centers cannot meet the demands of the rising numbers of \nbetter educated but unemployed youth. Indonesia\u2019s percentage of youth not in employment, \neducation, and training (NEET) has been declining but was still elevated at 20.5% (the rate is \nhigher, at 26.2%, for females) in 2019; higher than in the Philippines (18.8%), Thailand (14.9%), \nand Viet Nam (14.4%).15 Second, training provided by technical and vocational education and \ntraining (TVET) institutions does not prepare students for employment because coordination \namong TVET policies, TVET providers, and industry associations is weak. Studies have shown \nthat graduates of TVET programs have difficulty finding employment because of poor quality \nprograms and the mismatch between the skills provided and labor market demand.16 Third, \nlearning deficits start early for Indonesian youth, with poor learning outcomes reinforced every \nyear because of, among others, a lack of innovative thinking on the delivery of education. \nEvidence shows that new and emerging education technologies have not been used optimally \n(i.e., targeted at improving teaching and learning) to make a difference in learning outcomes, and \nteachers  lack  the  capacity  to  use  education  technologies  to  improve  children\u2019s  learning \nexperience.17 Fourth, quality varies widely across higher education institutions and a number of \nthem  lack  innovative  approaches  in  using  digital  technology  to  improve  the  quality  and \ncompetitiveness of education and research. The job placement of higher education graduates in \n \n14 ADB. 2020. Innovate Indonesia: Unlocking Growth through Technological Transformation. Manila. \n15 World Bank.

Washington, DC. \n ", "5 \nthe area of their competency remains low, and relatively few innovation centers across higher \neducation institutions facilitate entrepreneurial activities among students. Indonesia\u2019s spending \non research and development is 0.08% of GDP, considerably lower than the ASEAN average \n(0.7%) (footnote 14). \n \n11.  Social protection and health policies are not sufficient to achieve human capital \ndevelopment objectives. Four key issues contribute to this binding constraint. First, even with \nincreased social protection following the COVID-19 outbreak, the coverage and adequacy of \nsocial protection remain lower than the regional average. For instance, an unemployment benefit \nframework is lacking. In the absence of such a framework, households that are otherwise above \nthe poverty line and in employment may suddenly face the risk of slipping into poverty because \nof job losses. More households headed by women (56.7%) said they did not have savings to help \ncushion the impact of the COVID-19 crisis compared with those headed by men (50.6%) (footnote \n11). Second, beneficiary databases across different social protection programs are not aligned. \nThis has led to inclusion and exclusion errors in targeting and has undermined social protection \ncoverage and effectiveness. Third, policy coherence and effective interagency coordination to \naddress stunting are lacking. Stunting is a complex issue which requires several layers of \ninterventions to make an impact, recent evaluation of development partners\u2019 supported programs \nhave not been encouraging. According to the most recent data, 27.7% of children under the age \nof 5 exhibited signs of stunting, above the 25.7% average for Southeast Asia.18 Stunting is often \ncaused by malnutrition and poor health (sanitation) in early childhood and can prevent children \nfrom reaching their full physical and mental potential later in life, causing large long-term economic \ncosts. The costs of stunting are inter-generational, as mothers who experienced stunting during \ntheir childhoods are more likely to have children who suffer from stunting. Fourth, given the clear \nsynergies between health, nutrition policies, and educational outcomes among children and \nyoung adults, the government\u2019s health sector strategy needs to be better aligned with human \ncapital development objectives. \n \n12.  Strategic alignment. The program is aligned with the government\u2019s Vision of Indonesia \n2045 and National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN), 2020\u20132024, which focus on \nhuman resources development.19 It is also aligned with the first strategic pathway, on improving \nwell-being (covering health, social protection, education, and workforce skills), of ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024; and is included in the country operations business \nplan for Indonesia, 2021\u20132023.20 The program contributes to ADB Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; accelerating progress in \ngender equality; tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.21 \n \nB.

Programmatic  approach  and  budget  support.  The  program,  consisting  of  three \nsubprograms,  aims  to  enhance  labor  productivity  through  human  capital  development.22 It \nfocuses on three critical reform areas: (i) strengthened policies to finance and monitor  the \nimplementation of the SDGs; (ii) improved educational attainment and skills development; and  \n(iii) enhanced social protection and public health systems. While each of these areas is highly \ncritical and may have benefitted from a separate dedicated program on its own, this program \ncluster adopts the approach of providing a high-level overarching framework which will be \nsupplemented by a series of investment projects. All 12 prior actions for subprogram 1 have been \ncompleted. Channels through which the program will enhance human capital in Indonesia include \nmore inclusive and sustainable health insurance, improved quality of education and TVET, more \ninclusive and equitable social protection, and enhanced quality of health care (Figure 3). Some of \nthe policy actions will have a direct and immediate impact on human capital, while others will have \nan indirect impact leading to gradual improvement over a longer period.

This reform area focuses on the overall monitoring and \nimplementation of SDGs including at the local level, as well as financing (budget allocation and \nfiscal transfers) of health programs to meet SDG targets such as universal health coverage. The \nreform area supports SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 3 (good health), and SDG 5 (gender equality). \nThree key reforms were achieved in subprogram 1. First, the government increased the number \nof SDG centers to 23, from nine before the program. These SDG centers are set up in partnership \nwith local universities and will play an important role in localizing SDGs to help subnational \ngovernments plan and monitor the implementation of local SDG programs. These centers will \nalso strengthen participation and ownership at the local level for overall SDG implementation. \nSecond, related to SDG 3, and to make the national health insurance more sustainable and yet \naffordable for lower-income groups, the government through issuance of a Presidential regulation, \nincreased the monthly premium for first-class service from $5.6 to $10.5 per person, and for \nsecond-class service from $3.6 to $7.0 per person. The premium for third-class service was also \nincreased from $1.8 to $2.9 per person, but this was partially subsidized.23 Total subsidies for the \npoor and vulnerable groups were increased from approximately $1.9 billion in 2019 to $3.4 billion \nin 2020. The regulation also mandated a review of the health benefits included in the insurance. \nThird, to increase health expenditures and outcomes at the subnational level, the government \nearmarked 8% of the general allocation fund and 30% of the regional incentive fund transferred \nto  local  governments  for  health  expenditures.24 In  addition,  acknowledging  the  connection \nbetween women\u2019s welfare and stunting reduction, the government also issued regulations that \nrequire subnational governments to prioritize spending on direct stunting reduction and women\u2019s \nparticipation in economic activities at the village level. \n \n16.  The government will build on these reforms in subprograms 2 and 3 to achieve the \noutcome  indicators  related  to  improvement  in  the  SDG  index  score.  To  support  SDG \nimplementation by subnational governments, the government will expand the SDG centers to all \n34 provinces by 2025. Additional fiscal and capacity support will be provided to provinces with \nlagging performance. The government will also streamline benefits across the treatment classes \n \n23 There are three classes in the national health insurance (Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3), based on the amount of \npremium paid and the type of wards and/or rooms provided in the participating hospitals. \n24 Subnational fiscal transfers for health expenses were about $6.0 billion in 2021, compared to $2.7 billion in 2020. \n ", "8 \nof the national health insurance based on the recommendations of the review of the health \nbenefits included in the insurance. \n \n17.  Reform area 2: Improved educational attainment and skills development. This reform \narea focuses on educational and skills development outcomes and supports SDG 4 (quality \neducation), SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG 8 (decent work). Five key reforms were achieved \nin subprogram 1. First, to address unemployment, including unemployment resulting from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, the government launched the preemployment card (Kartu Pra Kerja) \nprogram to provide subsidized training and job search allowance for job seekers. The program \ncovered more than 5 million beneficiaries in 2020 and an additional 2.7 million beneficiaries in \n2021, across all 34 provinces. Implementation in the first half of 2021 also saw an increase in \nwomen\u2019s participation to from 45% in 2020 to 50% of beneficiaries. Second, to complement the \nimplementation of the preemployment card and to improve labor market prospects for youth, the \ngovernment implemented JobStart Indonesia in Bandung Barat and Makassar, which included \n45% female job seekers and provided gender-responsive skills training modules.25 \n \n18.  Third, the government undertook measures to improve linkages between TVET and \nindustry demand. This was achieved through a regulation to include industry representatives from \nthe Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Employers Association in the steering committee to \nestablish a national TVET committee. This body will consist of primary stakeholders from the \ngovernment and the private sector and will assume a central role in the governance of the national \nTVET system. Further, to make TVET more reflective of industry needs, the government linked \nIndonesia\u2019s National Qualifications Framework (KKNI) with the Indonesia Work Competency \nStandards (SKKNI). These reforms will improve industry participation and make TVET more \ndemand driven. Fourth, the government also addressed the problem of low learning outcomes \namong Indonesia\u2019s primary and secondary students by enhancing the capacities of teachers. To \nprepare  teachers  for  student-centered  teaching  and  learning  practices,  the  government \nimplemented a digital marketplace (Guru Penggerak) for in-service training, aimed at teachers \nacross  the  country.  Finally,  to  improve  the  quality  of  higher  education  in  Indonesia,  the \ngovernment, through the Indonesia Cyber Education Institute, launched a digital platform for \nonline  courses  and  programs  from  Coursera, EdX,  Udacity,  FutureLearn,  and  participating \nIndonesian universities. \n \n19.  The government will build on these reforms in subprograms 2 and 3 to achieve outcome \nindicators, including increasing learning-adjusted years of schooling. Under subprogram 2, the \nnumber of beneficiaries of the preemployment card program will increase to 5 million (45% \nwomen) and linkages with industry partners will be improved. The government will also expand \nthe JobStart program to three additional provinces (with at least 50% female registered job \nseekers) and will complete two cycles of life skills training, technical training, and internships in \neach of the new provinces. The government will also establish the national TVET committee. \nOther actions will increase industry roles in the provision of TVET and consolidate a national \nframework for KKNI and SKKNI. Under subprogram 3, the government will strengthen the \nmonitoring of TVET at all levels and implement national skills standards among line ministries, \nand provincial and district TVET agencies. \n \n20.  Reform area 3: Enhanced social protection and public health systems. This reform \narea aims to improve human capital development through interventions in social protection and \nhealth. It supports SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 3 (good health), SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG \n \n25 JobStart is a flagship program introduced by ADB in the Philippines, which aims to remove key barriers to youth \nemployment such as lack of life skills, technical training, and practical work experience. \n ", "9 \n8 (decent work). Four key reforms were achieved in subprogram 1. First, to provide income \nprotection and security against job loss, the government introduced the Jaminan Kehilangan \nPekerjaan (JKP) unemployment benefit scheme, as stipulated by the Job Creation Law, 2020 \n(Omnibus Law). The JKP is an unemployment insurance scheme financed by employers and \ngovernment transfers that initially covers formal wage employees enrolled in the national social \nsecurity scheme to help mitigate the impact of unemployment shocks on households\u2019 incomes \nand consumption.26 Second, to improve the targeting accuracy of social protection programs, the \ngovernment issued a decree to link data on beneficiaries with the national identification number. \nThis will reduce related inclusion and exclusion errors and provide sex-disaggregated data. Third, \nto address stunting, the government issued a Presidential regulation which revised the National \nStrategy to Accelerate Stunting Prevention and included the family planning agency in the national \ncoordination mechanism on stunting.27 This is important as the agency has the mandate to \nestablish norms and standards for family planning and to empower community organizations to \nparticipate in issues related to reproductive health. Finally, the government issued a directive to \nrevise Indonesia\u2019s Health Sector Reform Strategy to address gaps in the health sector across \ndifferent dimensions such as policy, efficiency and funding, innovative service delivery, and a \nperformance monitoring framework aligned with the SDGs and RPJMN. \n \n21.  Under subprogram 2, the government will implement the unemployment benefit program \nby issuing regulations and guidelines to finance the program and will include labor market \nactivation measures such as training and counseling requirements. Under subprogram 3, the \ngovernment will increase the unemployment benefit coverage by introducing a contributory \nscheme that will also cover informal sector workers, which will benefit women in particular as \nwomen account for 40.4% of total informal employment (in 2019) in Indonesia.28 Building on \nreforms in social protection, in subprograms 2 and 3, the government will expand coverage and \nstrengthen the implementation of the conditional cash transfer program (PKH) using a revised \nand updated national poverty database. The government will also implement the revised National \nStrategy to Accelerate Stunting Prevention. Public interventions will be launched to tackle stunting \nbased on an in-depth analysis of consumption and expenditure patterns using the improved \nNutritional Status Survey together with the National Socio-Economic Survey.29 Finally, the revised \nhealth sector strategy will be implemented in subprograms 2 and 3. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s value addition and sustainability. The programmatic approach builds on ADB\u2019s \ncoordinated support for the government\u2019s structural reform agenda over the last decade. This \nincludes the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, setting the framework for the \nimplementation of the SDGs; fiscal decentralization for improved public service delivery; and \nvarious education, skills development, social protection, and health projects (Figure 4). As noted \nin para.14, the program aims to provide a coordinated overarching national level policy framework \nthat is appropriate for the highly decentralized service delivery environment in Indonesia, instead \nof addressing the 3 key areas in different programs. The program will increase labor productivity \ngrowth through policy reforms in human capital. ADB has supported subprogram 1 in designing \nthe unemployment benefit, implementing the digital marketplace to enhance teachers\u2019 capacity, \n \n26 The system provides an average replacement rate of 35% of the lost wage for 6 months. The scheme is financed by \nemployers and the government, with at least 6-month history of contributions.  \n27 The revised National Strategy to Accelerate Stunting Prevention also aligns different levels of government and adopts \na  \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d  approach involving 22  ministries  that  cover  health,  early childhood  education and \ndevelopment, water, sanitation and hygiene, food security and social protection \n28 International Labour Organization. (2021). ILOSTAT database [Data Explorer], (accessed 11 October 2021). \n29 A number of public interventions are in place in Indonesia to address stunting such as food fortification, dietary \nsupplement to expecting mothers, pre-natal and post-natal health care services, social awareness campaigns, social \nassistance, and cash/food transfers.  \n ", "10 \nstrengthening the implementation of the PKH, developing a blockchain-enabled digital credential \nsystem for higher education, and developing the health sector strategy. The program will further \nsupport the sustainability of reforms through (i) regular policy dialogue and knowledge inputs, (ii) \ntargeted TA to support the implementation of reforms,30 and (iii) building synergy with, and \ncomplementing, ADB\u2019s other sovereign and nonsovereign operations in education, health, and \nsocial  protection.  For  example,  the  program\u2019s  focus  on  human  capital  development  will \ncomplement the proposed Competitiveness, Industrial Modernization, and Trade Acceleration \nProgram, which focuses on creating an enabling environment for industries to thrive.31 The \nprogram  will  also  complement  the  proposed  Advancing  Social  Protection  for  Poverty  and \nInequality Reduction results-based lending program as well as ADB\u2019s programmatic support for \nfinancial inclusion, state-owned enterprise restructuring, and domestic resource mobilization.  \n \nFigure 4: ADB\u2019s Sequenced Structural Reform Agenda \n2016\u20132020:\nDevelopment of SDG framework, \nimprove enabling environment for \nprivate sector, skills development \n2008\u20132012: project, TA on social assistance\nLocal \ngovernment \nfinancing, governance \nreform program\nloan, and TA \n2021\u20132025: \n2001\u20132006\nProposed Human Capital \nLarge-scale TA to set up  Development Program; \nbasic PFM systems,  2012\u20132017: Competitiveness, Industrial \nincluding at the subnational  Project on polytechnic \nModernization and Trade \nlevel education, TA on teaching \nAcceleration Program; Higher \nquality, school management, \nEducation for Technology and \n2006\u20132008:  and education policy Innovation Project; Advancing \nImplementation of MDGs;  Social Protection for Poverty and \ncommunity health and  Inequality Reduction \nnutrition projects\nADB = Asian Development Bank, MDG = Millennium Development Goal, PFM = public financial management, \nSDG = Sustainable Development Goal, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n23.  Lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  in  supporting  structural  reforms  in \nIndonesia has informed the program design through three key lessons. First, through the Poverty \nReduction and Millennium Development Goals Acceleration Program, ADB learned that meeting \ninternational development targets requires both national planning and design strategies, and local \nexecution.32 The proposed program supports the Ministry of National Development Planning \n(BAPPENAS) as the government\u2019s focal point for the SDGs, and implementation through local \ngovernments supported by SDG centers. Second, human capital development programs work \nbest when synergy exists between planning and financing, and an incentive framework is provided \nfor local governments to meet the SDG indicators. Both BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Finance \nare implementing agencies of this program. This will be particularly helpful when additional \nsupport needs to be provided for lagging provinces. Third, ADB\u2019s engagement in education, \nhealth, and skills development projects shows that it is critical to engage with local governments, \n \n30 ADB. 2016.

These policy \nreforms should be complemented by investment projects, as they are mutually reinforcing. \n \n24.  Development partner coordination. The government, through the Coordinating Ministry \nfor  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA),  leads  development  partner  coordination  on  reforms  in  the \nprogram.33 ADB and development partners also take turns in hosting coordination and information \nsharing meetings.34 ADB coordinated preparation of the program with key development partners, \nincluding  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  (para.  29),  as  well  as  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund in terms of macroeconomic projections and structural reforms. \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n25.  The overarching development objectives that the program is aligned with is improvement \nof human quality in Indonesia, based on the RPJMN, and human development and mastery of \nscience and technology, based on Vision 2045 (footnote 19). The outcome of the reform is \nimproved human capital development. This is also consistent with the government\u2019s SDG road \nmap. The effect of the reforms will be demonstrated by the performance targets in the policy \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n26.  Results. The program contributes to the government\u2019s medium-term development targets. \nOverall, the program is expected to improve Indonesia\u2019s HCI from 54% in 2020 to 59% in 2026. \nThis rate of improvement will be faster than Indonesia\u2019s experience since 2010 when Indonesia\u2019s \nHCI was at 50%. Customized outcome indicators were also included to measure the success of \neach reform area. In reform area 1, the coverage of the national health insurance is expected to \nincrease from 223 million people in 2020 to 240 million people in 2026, thereby bringing Indonesia \ncloser to attainment of universal healthcare. In reform area 2, the gap in the NEET rate between \nmen and women is expected to narrow from 11.12 percentage points in 2020 to 7.50 percentage \npoints in 2026. The percentage of higher education graduates who find work within 1 year of \ngraduation is targeted to increase from 64.7% in 2020 to 66.7% in 2026. Outcome indicators for \nreform area 3 include increased social safety net coverage of the poorest quintile from 66% in \n2020 to 75% in 2026 and a reduction in stunting among children under age 5 years old from 27.7% \nin 2019 to 14.0% in 2026. An assessment of the program\u2019s impact reveals that benefits will accrue \nto poorer and vulnerable Indonesians in the form of higher wages and better employment \noutcomes than would otherwise have been observed.35 \n \n27.  Benefits to the private sector. The program\u2019s overarching objective of improving labor \nproductivity is closely linked to private sector development. This is especially demonstrated \nthrough policy actions in reform areas 2 and 3. Skilled and healthy labor is critical for private \nenterprises to invest and prosper in Indonesia. Reforms such as the unemployment benefit \nprogram are equally important as they allow the government to reduce severance pay and thereby \nmake the labor market more flexible. In addition, the private sector is an integral part of several \nreform initiatives. JobStart includes private sector consultations, so that the life skills and technical \ntraining are demand based. Private sector representatives are included in the steering committee \nto prepare for the establishment of the national TVET committee. To ensure that the pace of \nreforms is consistent and that private sector beneficiaries feel the intended effects, a monitoring \nand feedback mechanism will include private sector representatives (para. 31). \n \n \n33 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 ADB chaired the most recent meeting on 10 September 2021.   \n35 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n28.  The government projects its financing needs to be $99.1 billion in 2021, which will be met \nthrough domestic ($70.8 billion\u2013$83.0 billion) and foreign ($19.0 billion\u2013$23.5 billion) sources. \nThe government\u2019s fiscal stance remains flexible to respond to public health needs arising from \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed programmatic approach comprising three subprograms \nis estimated to cost $1.5 billion. Subprogram 1 of $500 million is estimated to represent 0.5% of \nthe government\u2019s financing needs in 2021. The size of the loan is based on the country\u2019s current \nfinancing needs and the impact of the reforms. Over the medium term, the financing gap for SDG \nimplementation up to 2030 is estimated to exceed $1 trillion. The government\u2019s budget allocation \nin 2021 to implement the reforms in subprogram 1 exceeds $20 billion. This includes significant \nallocations for SDG implementation (about $5.0 billion), stunting (about $3.1 billion), and national \nhealth insurance ($3.4 billion). \n \n29.  The government has requested a regular loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line \nrepayment method, the average maturity is 9.25 years, and no maturity premium is payable to \nADB. German development cooperation through KfW is expected to provide parallel cofinancing \nof 400 million Euros for subprogram 1. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The CMEA will be the executing agency. BAPPENAS; the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry \nof Education, Culture, Research and Technology; the Ministry of Social Affairs; the Ministry of \nManpower; and the Ministry of Health will be the implementing agencies. The implementation \nperiod will be from August 2019 to August 2021 for subprogram 1, from September 2021 to \nJuly 2023 for subprogram 2, and from August 2023 to July 2025 for subprogram 3.  The proceeds \nof the policy-based loan will be withdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, \nas amended from time to time).36 The likely disbursement date will be the first quarter of 2022. \n \n31.  Program monitoring mechanisms. The CMEA, as the executing agency, will hold \nmonitoring meetings twice a year with the implementing agencies, ADB, and the program\u2019s \ncofinancing partner(s). Chaired by the deputy minister, the meetings will monitor progress and \ncoordinate knowledge work and TA. The findings from the meetings will guide the implementation \nof the program as well the government\u2019s broader reform measures. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n32.  Poverty. The poverty rate increased to 10.2% in 2020 from 9.2% in 2019 (footnote 9). The \njob losses, work stoppages, and reduced working hours caused by the pandemic may push more \nworkers and their families into poverty. In 2020, the unemployment rate rose to 7.1%, the highest \nin  a  decade,  from  5.3%  in  2019.  The  youth  unemployment  rate  also  increased  to  \n20.5% in 2020 from 18.6% in 2019. The program\u2019s reform measures will contribute to poverty \nreduction and better labor market outcomes in Indonesia.  The program will support better \ncoverage  and  targeting  of  social  protection  programs  and  will  provide  income  support  to \n \n36 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "13 \nunemployed workers during crises. The preemployment card and JobStart will contribute to a \nreduction in youth unemployment and the NEET rate. \n \n33.  Gender. Subprogram 1 is categorized effective gender mainstreaming at entry. Key \nreforms  include  (i)  targeting  female  participation  in  the  preemployment  card  and  JobStart \nprograms, (ii) developing gender-responsive life skills training modules for JobStart, (iii) spending \non women\u2019s empowerment and stunting reduction in villages, and (iv) improving the accuracy of \nsocial  assistance  programs  by  including  sex-disaggregated  data.  Among  the  notable \nachievements in subprogram 1 include high participation of women in pre-employment card \nprogram (50% in 2021) and teacher training initiative (64% in 2021) (Box 2). Further reforms to \nimprove gender mainstreaming will be implemented in subsequent subprograms. \n \n34.  Public financial management. The framework for public financial management is well \nestablished in Indonesia and is supported by systems that cover internal controls, accounting and \nreporting  procedures,  internal  and  external  audit,  and  strengthened  accountability  and \ntransparency reporting. The 2017 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment \nreport concluded that Indonesia has a strong legal and regulatory framework, particularly for fiscal \nmanagement and control of budget execution, with 17 out of 31 indicators scoring above the basic \nalignment with international good practice.37 Indicators with particularly good assessment results \ninclude transparency of public finance, and accounting and reporting. When compared with the \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment Report of 2011, improvements were \nidentified in 11 out of 31 indicators. Important improvements were recorded in (i) the predictability \nof in-year resource allocation, (ii) parliamentary scrutiny of the budget, and (iii) accounting for \nrevenue. \n \n35.  Safeguards and climate change. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), the program is classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples safeguards. The program is not expected to have any adverse environmental \nor social safeguard impacts within the meaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nimpact of climate change on the program is low. The program supports the government\u2019s \nnationally  determined  contribution  to  the  Paris  Agreement.  Subprogram  1  is  assessed  to \ncontribute $46.88 million in climate change adaptation and $15.63 million in mitigation.38 \n \n36.  Risk and mitigation measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nthe table and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 \n \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nWorsening COVID-19  ADB is providing TA support to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of \npandemic  Social Affairs to strengthen their service delivery (including vaccine \n  financing) and social protection programs. ADB also supported the \ngovernment\u2019s response to the pandemic through the COVID-19 Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program. ADB will continue supporting \nthe government\u2019s response through a combination of TA and policy dialogue \nunderpinning policy-based lending programs including the Competitiveness, \nIndustrial Modernization, and Trade Acceleration Program as well as \nprograms related to financial inclusion, and domestic resource mobilization. \n \n37 World  Bank.  2018.

The regulation also mandated \nevaluation of basic health needs covered in the national health insurance plan. In addition, to make the national health insurance program more affordable, the government \nincreased subsidy to the national health insurance program from Rp26.5 trillion in 2019 to Rp48.8 trillion in 2020. The same higher amount was maintained for the 2021 \nbudget .  \nd  The general allocation fund covers basic allocation including civil service salary and fiscal gap; the regional incentive fund is an incentive fund based on subnational \ngovernments\u2019 performance including in growth, inflation control, and public finance management; and the Village Fund is allocated to villages and are used to finance \ngovernment administration and community development and empowerment. The allocations from the general allocation fund and the regional incentive fund for health \nexpenditures are evidenced through the issuance of the Ministry of Finance Decree 17/2021. The prioritization on stunting and women\u2019s participation in economic activities \nis evidenced through the issuances of Ministry of Finance Decree 222/2020 and Ministry of Villagesf, Disadvantaged Regions and Transmigration Decree 13/2020. The \nsubnational fiscal transfers for health expenses in 2021 were about Rp85.2 trillion, compared to Rp38.3 trillion in 2020.  \ne  JobStart is a youth employment program that provides full training cycle for unemployed youth, including counselling, life skills, and technical training. Criteria for the selection \nof Bandung Barat and Makassar as pilot provinces included rate of youth unemployment and support and ownership by the subnational governments. From 2018 to 2020, \nthe youth unemployment rate increased from 29.9% to 38.0% in Makassar and from 31.2% to 34.6% in Bandung Barat, while the national average of youth unemployment \nwent down from 34.5% to 27.5% during the same period.  \nf  The launching of the preemployment card program is evidenced through issuance of the Presidential regulation 76/2020, which subsidized training to assist unemployed and \nretrenched employees to upskill and reenter the labor market.    \ng  The  national  TVET  committee  includes  (i)  Coordinating  Ministries  of  Economic  Affairs;  (ii)  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Human  Development  and  Cultural  Affairs;  \n(iii) Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS); (iv) Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology; (v) Ministry of Manpower; (vi) Ministry of Industry; \nand (vii) private sector associations. The strategy to link KKNI and SKKNI will be adopted in subprogram 2, forming the basis of a new regulation.   \nh  Digital platform for online courses includes courses from international providers such as Coursera, EdX, Udacity, and FutureLearn. \nI  The government issued a regulation on unemployment benefit in 2021 (Government regulation 37/2021) covering formal sector works enrolled in the national social security \nscheme. Currently, about 10% of the workforce (about 12.4 million workers) is covered by the unemployment benefit scheme, mostly in the formal sector. Ceiling on covered \nearnings is Rp9 million per month (3.7 times average earnings). Replacement rate is 45% for the first 3 months and a 25% for the next 3 months (average of 35% for 6 \nmonths). The scheme is financed by employers and the government, with at least 6-month history of contributions.    \nj  A ministerial decree was issued in 2020 by the Ministry of Social Affairs to link data on beneficiaries with the national identification number. \nk  The government issued a Presidential regulation on stunting in August 2021 (72/2021) to include the National Family Planning Agency in the national coordination mechanism \nof the strategy on stunting. The National Planning Agency\u2019s Strategy for 2020\u20132024 includes providing information to help women be aware of nutritional needs during \npregnancy, infant stimulation, and the need to access prenatal care at a health clinic at least four times throughout the pregnancy. \nl  Based on the experience implementing JobStart in the Philippines and resources available, expansion to 3 additional provinces is appropriate. Sequencing of reforms under \nsubprogram 1, subprogram 2, and subprogram 3 follows a clear logic: (i) pilot JobStart in 2 provinces, (ii) expand to additional provinces; and (iii) institutionalize as a national \nprogram and national rollout based on capacity and readiness of provinces. Institutionalizing JobStart means adopting a regulation to make it a national program. \nm The government will issue regulation(s) to finance the unemployment benefit program and implement guidelines on labor market activation measures.  \nn  Under subprogram 2, the government will issue implementation guidelines for the new Health Sector Reform Strategy. \no  The performance-based lending to be introduced under subprogram 3 will build on subnational fiscal transfer reforms in 1.3 and 2.3. The criteria for lending from central \ngovernment may include debt sustainability and public financial management systems of subnational governments.  \np  The government will issue regulations on standard-based TVET teacher development framework and revise the accreditation guidelines for TVET institutions (also through \nan issuance of a regulation).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "Appendix 2  21 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=54461-001-3 \n \n1.
