INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  regional  initiatives  that  help  its \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  adapt  to  climate  change  impacts  through  regional \nClimate Change Implementation Plans. The plan for South Asia1 supports an economic analysis \nto evaluate  the  costs  and  benefits  of  climate  change  and  adaptation  and  to  build  DMCs' \ncapacities to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. This regional policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA), with cofinancing from the Government of the United Kingdom through \nthe Department for International Development (DFID), will support the second part of the study \non Regional Economics of Climate Change in South Asia.2 The first part of this study focuses on \nthe potential of cleaner technologies, based on an analysis of the marginal abatement cost. \nPreliminary agreements were reached on the impact, outcome, implementation arrangements, \ncost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.3 The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Climate change impacts are increasingly visible in Asia and the Pacific, with South Asia \nbeing the most vulnerable region.5 The impact of climate change can already be seen in the \ngreater variability of the monsoon, increased frequency of tropical cyclone, and faster melting of \nthe Himalayan glaciers, which could affect half a billion people in the Hindu Kush\u2013Himalaya \nregion.6  It is estimated that the total area of the Himalayan glaciers are likely to shrink from the \npresent  500,000  square  kilometers  to  100,000  square  kilometers  by  2035.7 Moreover,  the \nmonsoon in South Asia will become stronger, with up to 20% more rain falling in India and \nBangladesh by 2050.8 Furthermore, sea level rise in Asia is likely to be about 40 centimeters by \nthe end of the 21st century, which will increase the annual number of people flooded in coastal \npopulations from 13 million to 94 million.9 \n \n3.  If current trends continue until 2050, the yields of irrigated crops in South Asia are \nprojected to decrease significantly\u2014maize by 17%, wheat by 12%, and rice by 10%\u2014as a result   \nof climate change-induced water stress.10 An increase in occurrence of extreme weather events \nincluding  heat  waves  and  intense  precipitation  events  are  also  projected  with  a  resultant \ndecrease in agriculture production. Future climate change-induced shifts in ocean currents, the \nsea level, sea-water temperature, salinity, wind speed and direction, strength of upwelling, and \npredator response are all likely to alter fish-breeding habitats as well as their food supply, \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2008.

Consequences \nfor downstream agriculture, which relies on this water for irrigation, will be likely unfavorable in \nmost South Asian countries.12 \n \n4.  In the future, public health, biodiversity, agricultural production and food security, access \nto drinking water, migration and even regional geo-political stability are likely to be affected. \nClimate change is also likely to impact various economies, including (i) the public budget, which \nis needed for climate change adaptation (e.g., flood control, afforestation and reforestation, \nclimate proofing infrastructure, and pollution control) including the development of disaster risk \nmanagement plans; (ii) terms of trade (e.g., impact on hydropower exports, falling agricultural \nyields, reduced labor productivity, and faster natural resources depletion); and (iii) welfare of \npopulation (i.e., price increases, flooding, pollution, and health impacts). \n \n5.  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and the Maldives are making efforts to cope with climate \nchange and have prepared the national adaptation program of action in 2005, 2007, 2008, and \n2006, respectively. Nepal is in the process of developing such a program. A climate change cell \nwas also established in Bangladesh in 2004, while Sri Lanka created a specific climate change \nsecretariat within the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources dealing with both \nadaptation and mitigation issues (footnote 1). However, capabilities and capacities need to be \nenhanced to address emerging issues and to mobilize financing, especially for the development \nof disaster risk management plans.  \n \n6.  Strategy 2020 emphasizes three distinct but complementary development agendas for \nADB\u2014inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth including addressing the \nimpact  of  climate  change,  and  regional  integration.13 Its  South  Asia  regional  cooperation \nstrategy and program, 2006\u20132008, also supported regional environmental cooperation through \nknowledge-based  research  and  information  sharing  as  well  as  through  capacity-building \nactivities.  Thus, ADB has been providing assistance to South Asian DMCs to adapt and reduce \ntheir vulnerability to impacts of climate change through mainstreaming adaptation issues into \ninvestment  planning;  developing  national  adaptation  capacity;  and  coordinating  and \nstrengthening international responses for adaptation, emphasizing poverty reduction, private \nsector  participation,  and  regional  cooperation.14 For  example,  a  TA  in  Nepal  is  assisting \ngovernment agencies responsible for environmental management in raising awareness, building \nnew and strengthening existing capacities and skills, and mainstreaming environmental and \nclimate change considerations into the national development agenda.15 Another TA in Sri Lanka \naims to  increase  resilience  to  climate  change impacts  in  support  of sustainable  economic \n                                                \n11 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2001.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n7.  The TA will (i) contribute to regional policy dialogue on economic costs and benefits of \nunilateral and regional actions on climate change adaptation, (ii) review existing climate policies \nand measures at the country and regional levels, (iii) identify policy gaps and constraints in \nimplementing appropriate adaptation measures, (iv) conduct economic assessment of the costs \nand benefits of unilateral and regional adaptation actions, and (v) suggest adaptation measures \nbased on low-carbon strategies in participating DMCs. It will cover five DMCs\u2014Bangladesh, \nBhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka\u2014and possibly India. \n \n8.   This TA will coordinate with other ongoing and planned climate change initiatives in the \nparticipating DMCs and build upon existing studies. It will cover the whole region, as no such \nstudy has yet been conducted. Although there were studies in India, and to some extent in \nBangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, limited studies were conducted in Bhutan and the Maldives. \n  \n9.   This TA will also develop a climate policy simulation tool (CPST) that will create key \neconomic indicators to show the economic consequences of different packages of climate \npolicies  and  to  conduct  quantitative  and  qualitative  assessment  of  different  climate  policy \npackages. This tool will help policy makers select concrete and appropriate economic policies \nthat will adapt and respond to different climate policy scenarios for each participating DMC. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The expected impact is to enhance resilience to climate change risks in South Asia. \nExpected outcomes include improved understanding of the economics of climate change to \nenable policy makers in the region to adopt necessary actions for climate change adaptation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.   This TA will comprise four outputs with corresponding activities, as follows.   \n \n(i)  Country and regional assessments. The TA will (a) assess current climate \nchange policies and adaptation measures at the country and regional levels; (b) \nidentify policy gaps, vulnerable areas and sectors, and segments of population; \n(c)  estimate  sector-specific  damages,  socioeconomic  impacts,  and  poverty \nimpacts; (d) analyze the implications of climate change for poverty reduction and \nsustainable  development  efforts;  (e) review  laws,  agreements,  or regulations \nimplemented,  adopted,  proposed,  or  under  preparation  that  address  climate \nchange  adaptation;  and  (f)  review  regional,  national,  or  local  initiatives  that \naddress climate change issues. It will cover and build from work carried out by \ngovernments,  academics,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  development \npartners working on climate change. The scoping will help identify research, \nresearch gaps, and needs for further research. The result of this activity will form \npart of an interim report. \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2009.

Analyses  of  future  climate \nchange impacts on major sectors including agriculture, forest, water, and marine \nand coastal resources (including fisheries), health, and energy at the regional \nand country levels will be conducted based on the outputs from the models under \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate scenarios. The analyses will \nbe made by applying an integrated assessment model. The impact assessment \nand climate adaptation policies and measures will be included in an interim \nreport. \n \n(iii)  Climate policy simulation. A CPST will be developed and used to generate key \neconomic indicators to show the economic consequences of different packages \nof climate policies and to conduct quantitative and qualitative assessment of \ndifferent  climate  policy  packages.  The  CPST, 17 a  consolidated  model,  is \ncomprised of three components: (a) adaptation and impact assessment, (b) low-\ncarbon options, and (c) a climate policy package. The CPST will help policy \nmakers to select climate-related policies with concrete economic consequences \nof climate policy choices and to strengthen the policy analysis related to the \neconomics of climate change.  \n \n(iv)  Dissemination. The results of the TA will be disseminated through publication of \narticles in external journals, books, and media; postings on the ADB website; and \npresentation at conferences and workshops. The final report will include the \ncombined results of part I and part II of the study. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.   The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,200,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV), and the remaining $700,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom.18 Possible  funding  from  other  sources  is  also  being \nexplored. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.   The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2010 to December 2011. \nADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  South  Asia  Department  will  implement  the  \nTA in close coordination with Regional and Sustainable Development Department and DFID.  \n \n14.  The management of the TA will follow a two-tiered structure. A study team, comprising \nnational  climate  experts from the  participating DMCs  and  international  consultants,  will  be \nformed to carry out the activities and will be led by an international consultant. A steering \ncommittee composed of senior government officials from participating DMCs (i.e., Bangladesh's \nMinistry of Environment and Forest; Bhutan's National Environment Commission; Maldives's \nMinistry of Housing, Transport and Environment; Nepal's Ministry of Environment, Science and \n                                                \n17 The CPST will cost $600,000. Component (A) adaptation and impact assessment will be funded under this TA, in    \nthe amount of $200,000.  Components (B) low-carbon options, and (C) climate policy package will be funded under \nthe proposed regional research and development TA for Economics of Climate Change and Low Carbon Growth \nStrategies in Northeast Asia and will cost $400,000.

No activities under this TA will be \ncommenced or financed in the territory of a DMC until a written no-objection has been obtained \nfrom the government of the country concerned. \n \n15.  The TA will require 34 person-months of international and 24 person-months of national \nconsulting services. It will use a combination of both individual consultants and a firm to fulfill the \nrequirements. A firm will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection with a simplified \ntechnical proposal.19 All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.20 The \nconsultants' terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.
