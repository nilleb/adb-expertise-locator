INTRODUCTION \n1.  Most water operators1 located in the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  suffer  from  multiple  weaknesses,  ranging  from  inappropriate \norganization and structure to poor service performance. Although some exceptions exist (e.g. \nwater  utilities  in  Singapore,  Manila  (East),  Hong  Kong,  China  and  Phnom  Penh,  whose \norganizational strength and superior service performance enables them to provide world class \nservice to consumers), the majority of water operators are unable to effectively provide safe \nwater and sanitation services in their coverage areas. \n \n2.  Recognizing these weaknesses, and in an effort to facilitate peer-based improvements \namong the water operators, the United Nations Secretary General\u2019s Advisory Board on Water \nand Sanitation (UNSGAB) announced its Compendium of Actions in March 2006.2 The actions \nidentified  by  UNSGAB  include  the  need  to  help  water  operators  improve  service  delivery \nthrough a structured program of cooperation among operators. In August 2006, ADB and the \nGlobal Water Partnership (GWP) signed an agreement, which includes collaboration in the \nestablishment  of  a  Water  Operators  Partnership  (WOP)  program  in  the  Asian  and  Pacific \nregions. \n \n3.  In Southeast Asia such a partnership already exists, in the form of the Southeast Asia \nWater Utilities Network (SEAWUN), which is partially supported by ADB. The WOP program \naims at establishment of similar networks of operators, initially planned in South, Central and \nEast Asia. The establishment of such networks is specifically recognized in ADB\u2019s water policy.3 \nA design and monitoring framework for the proposed technical assistance (TA) to support the \nWOP program in Asia is set out in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Water  operators  in  Asia  suffer  from  various  problems,  including  structural  and \norganizational  weaknesses,  poor  service  performance,  weak  financial  performance,  the \nabsence  of  internal  control,  wasteful  procurement  practices,  and  poor  consumer  relations. \nTaken together, these deficiencies significantly hinder the ability of the water operators to \ndeliver efficient and effective water and sanitation services. More importantly, they result in (i) \ninsufficient consumer coverage; (ii) difficulties in financing system expansion and maintenance, \nwhich  effectively  denies  consumers  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation;  and  (iii)  water \noperators remaining a continuing burden on federal and local finances. Cumulatively, these \noutcomes inhibit many DMCs from achieving Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7, target 10, \nwhich calls for halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation.4 \n \n5.  With few exceptions, structural and organizational weaknesses in the water sector in  \nAsia manifest as a lack of corporate status, insufficient autonomy and accountability, and a high \ndegree of control by local governments. Improving the performance of water utilities is a process \nrequiring commitment, support, and participation by all stakeholders, especially national and \nlocal governments. Governments should consider providing due autonomy to public utilities in \n                                                 \n1  Water  operators  include  water  and  wastewater  utilities,  community-based  water  supply  and  sanitation \norganizations, and nongovernment organizations providing water supply and sanitation services. \n2  UNSGAB. 2006.

Water utilities in Asia are not equipped to operate on a sustainable basis, and usually \ndeliver substandard service performance.5 System leakages are high\u2014typically, nonrevenue \nwater (NRW) ranges from 25% to 70%. Supplied water is either not metered or metering is \nproblematic, and presents billing and collection difficulties. Water quality is generally poor, and \nthere is lack of quality consciousness. Water is rarely supplied on a 24-hour basis; most urban \nconsumers are fortunate to receive water\u2014usually of indifferent quality\u2014a few hours each day. \nWhere water is supplied on a 24-hour basis, connection costs are high, and affordability is an \nissue in expanding coverage.6 \n \n7.  Poor service performance translates into correspondingly poor financial performance. \nTariff structures are poorly designed, handicapping tariff setting. The true costs of service \nprovision are rarely recovered. Where they are, there is often significant operational inefficiency \npassed on to consumers, resulting in resistance among consumers to paying water bills, and \nimpacting negatively on billing and collection. Little internal cash is generated, making it more \ndifficult for operators to finance capital expenditures. Where debt has to be serviced, debt \nservice ratios remain illusory. Investors remain shy of participating in capital projects, and \nconcessionaires and management contractors are unwilling to risk money and reputation in \nventures that show poor financial and operational results.7  \n  \n8.  The  utilities  in  general  suffer  from  substandard  management  capacity,  often \ndemonstrated by the inadequate educational background for specific tasks, lack of training and \nexposure to good practices, and a weak human resources development program that fails to \nrewards excellence. Moreover, internal controls are generally absent, as evidenced by weak \ninventory management and poor procurement practices; where they do exist, controls are often \ninadequate and elementary. Several ADB-financed projects show evidence of weaknesses in \nthese  areas.  In  addition,  consumer  relations  are  generally  unsatisfactory,  with  consumers \nalienated by poor service performance and high costs that are passed on to them. Persuading \nconsumers that service quality has improved is often difficult. \n \n9.  Although  the  challenges  are  considerable,  a  small  but  growing  number  of  water \noperators with steadily improving performance can transfer their good practice to relatively \nweaker operators, assisting the latter to increase their service and financial efficiency in ways \nthat can be monitored. In particular, the Singapore Public Utilities Board, the Phnom Penh \nWater Supply Authority, and the Manila Water Company offer examples of world class service \ndelivery and financial performance.  \n \n10.  Against this background, the development of utility networks is seen as a key means to \nshare knowledge and build capacity among utilities that are facing similar challenges. The \nimpetus for improvement is internal, and is driven by (i) an understanding of comparative \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2004. Asian Water Supplies. Manila. \n6  WSP. 2005. Workshop Proceedings \u2013 Managing Karachi\u2019s Water Supply and Sanitation Services. Karachi. This \nreport revealed that in South Asia, many cities provide less than 10% of their service areas with a 24-hour piped \nsupply. In fact, no city or town in South Asia has a water supply available 24-hours per day, 7 days per week. \nLahore is the best performer in the subregion, and provides water 16 to 18 hours per day. New Delhi provides \nwater for 5 hours, and Karachi for 8 hours each day Hyderabad (India) provides water 2 hours every second day. \n7  ADB\u2019s Asian Water Supplies (footnote 5), show that tariffs in most Asian cities are so low that there is no possibility \nof achieving price elasticity of demand. Average tariffs are between $0.01\u2013$0.05 per cubic meter (m3). In contrast, \nEuropean urban water supply tariffs range from $1.20\u2013$1.80 m3; Singapore\u2019s average domestic tariff is about \n$1/m3, and the tariff charged by the Manila Water Company is $0.40m3. \n ", "  3\nperformance levels among utilities and (ii) success factors. Such networks will be designed to \nundertake a range of activities to support quality enhancements. SEAWUN,8 established in 2003, \nis a leading Asian example of a network that has quickly developed a broad knowledge and \npractice sharing program that allows members to seek gains in sustainable ways.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will contribute to attainment of the MDGs by enhancing service performance of \nwater and wastewater utilities, enabling them to reach more people and improve their services \nto existing clients. This TA covering the next 2 years is part of a longer-term intervention that is \nenvisioned  to  extend  over  a  5-year  period.  This  TA  was  first  listed  in  the  ADB  Business \nOpportunities in January 2007. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The main outputs of the TA are (i) the establishment and operation of Water Utility \nNetworks (WUNs), (ii) the development and implementation of capacity-building and twinning \nprograms, (iii) the development and establishment of benchmarking systems, (iv) the adoption \nof change management processes that address specific areas of water utilities operations, and \n(v) a consensus on good practice institutional frameworks. \n \n13.  Separate water utilities networks will be established in a phased manner in South, \nCentral and East Asia, modeled on the existing SEAWUN.9 Networks memberships are based \non open invitation. Although the networks are targeting water utilities, membership may be \nextended to water associations or other interested parties, depending on the decision of the \nfounding members, and as outlined in the charter establishing a specific the network. The \nmembers are expected to contribute a membership fee, which may be subsidized initially. \n \n14.  Linkages will be developed among the networks and with the global community of \nnetworks anchored by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN Habitat). These \nnetworks are the platform for implementation of the capacity-building and twinning programs, \nand at the same time  provide the utilities the critical mass and organizational strength to \ndevelop and promote an institutional reform agenda for the sector.  \n \n15.  A capacity-building program will be designed and established within each network and \nalso across them. Discrete programs of activities will be designed and implemented for each \nnetwork, and will be continuously evaluated. The activities of SEAWUN will be enhanced and \nexpanded to focus on twinning and training programs. More specifically, the TA will:  \n \n(i)  Develop  twinning  arrangements  between  operators  that  have  already \nmodernized  their  services  and  set  high  performance  standards  and  those \nseeking support to improve their performance. These arrangements will be based \non performance-related incentives, and on a not-for-profit approach. Activities \nunder this twinning program include performance-based contracts, seconding \nexpert personnel, exchange visits, and on-site demonstrations. A unique feature \nof the twinning program will be the establishment of direct relationships between \n                                                 \n8  For detailed information see: http://www.adb.org/Water/SEAWUN/default.asp. \n9  No activity under the regional TA will be commenced or financed in the territory of a DMC until the government of \nthe DMC has given its \u201cno objection.\" \n ", "4   \npractitioners working in and with utilities, rather than the use of academics or \nexternal consultants. \n(ii)  Enable  utilities  to  develop  alternative  organizational  models  that  most \nappropriately  reflect  their  missions.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  autonomy  and \naccountability,  with  minimal  government  involvement.  Commercially  sound \noperating principles will be introduced, and utilities will be supported to run as \nwater businesses. \n(iii)  Support training programs and workshops that will allow members to adopt (a) \nenhanced financial management systems that focus on cost reduction, better \nasset management, proper tariff structures, and improved metering, billing and \ncollection;  and  (b)  improved  technical  management  systems  that  focus  on \noperation and maintenance, reducing NRW, increasing coverage and hours of \nservice, and improving water quality.  \n \n16.  The TA will undertake benchmarking exercises in each network to determine current \nperformance  parameters,  including  service  levels,  quality,  operational  efficiency,  financial \nmanagement, and customer satisfaction. The benchmarking exercises will follow the same \napproach as successfully implemented by SEAWUN, and supported by ADB.10 The purpose of \nthe benchmarking is twofold: (i) to enable members to compare performance and the factors \nthat govern it, and to identify the effect of applied skills; and (ii) to provide the driving force for \napplying the newly learned skills in order to attain the projected outcomes. In combination, the \ntwinning arrangements, training programs, and benchmarking exercises will assist utilities in \nincreasing their capacity and improving their service performance. \n \n17.  The key activities under the TA will support the delivery of the outputs identified above.  \n \n(i)  Workshops will be designed and conducted to discuss the merits and means of \nestablishing WUNs in South, Central and East Asia. Two workshops for each \nregion will be required for this purpose, with the second workshop being used to \nlaunch the network. The introductory workshop for South Asia was completed in \nDecember 2006 and an agreement was made to hold the second workshop to \nestablish the WUN and launch the WOPs program in Islamabad, Pakistan in April \n2007.11 Locations  for  workshops  in  Central  and  East  Asia  have  yet  to  be \nidentified.12 \n(ii)  Membership and administrative facilities, modeled on the SEAWUN pattern, will \nbe designed and established. A detailed program of activities for each network \nwill be developed, including the establishment of a secretariat, fully costed and \nresourced, over the medium term. The support of development partners will be  \nsought in designing and implementing the programs. The support for SEAWUN \nwill be continued during the first year, after which the SEAWUN secretariat is \nexpected  to  be  self-sustaining  through  membership  fees.  Allocations  for  an \nannual meeting in 2008 for each of the networks have also been made, with \nplanning and training workshops folded into these annual meetings.  \n(iii)  The twinning programs will be implemented upon the design and establishment \nof  each  network.  A  performance  audit  will  be  undertaken,  and  results  and \npotential activities discussed between twinning partners. Twinning and training \n                                                 \n10 http://www.adb.org/Water/SEAWUN/ADB-support.asp. \n11 A \u201cno-objection\u201d from the Government of Pakistan has been secured.  \n12 A \u201cno-objection\u201d from the appropriate governments of the countries where these workshops will be held will be \nsecured before any activity is begun. \n \n ", "  5\nactivities will be detailed at planning workshops that involve interested members. \nInitially the twinning program will be developed on a not-for-profit basis. It is \nrecognized,  however,  that  fee-  or  performance-based  models  need  to  be \ndeveloped to ensure the required sustainability. Several training programs13 will \nbe developed to help utilities improve their performance, covering: (a) NRW \nreduction,  (b)  asset  management,  (c)  full  cost  recovery,  (d)  enabling  water \nservices delivery for the urban poor, (e) risk management, (f) regulation, (g) \nfinancial management, (h) water quality management, and (i) customer relations.  \n(iv)  A benchmarking exercise will be designed and conducted that will determine \nperformance levels in core areas of water utility operations, including service \nlevels  and  quality,  operational  efficiency,  and  financial  management.  The \nexercise  will  be  supported  by  workshops  to  agree  on  a  set  of  performance \nindicators, explain the benchmarking process, and ensure consistency in the \ndata  collected.  Workshops  to  share  the  results,  identify  best  practices,  and \neventually  develop  strategies  for  continuous  improvement  will  also  be \norganized.14 The benchmarking exercise will be conducted regularly (i.e., every 2 \nyears). \n(v)  The  results  of  the  benchmarking exercise  will  allow  for the  introduction  and \nimplementation of change management processes that (a) identify priority areas \nneeding improvement, and (b) develop appropriate activities and programs to \naddress these. \n(vi)  The organization of WUNs will provide the opportunity for the exchange of ideas \nand experiences across borders. Assisted by the skills and information provided \nunder the twinning and training programs, the utilities should be able to identify \nthe institutional bottlenecks preventing optimal performance by the utilities. The \nTA supports water utilities in identifying and discussing these institutional issues, \nwhich are common across the Asian region, and will organize dialogues with the \nrelevant  decision  makers  in  specific  countries,  to  seek  consensus  on  good \npractice institutional frameworks and identify possible solutions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2 million. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe  Japan Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. The Social Sectors Division (SESS) in the \nSoutheast Asia Department will be responsible for coordinating all TA activities. Activities will be \ncarried out in close cooperation with the relevant regional departments and the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department (RSDD). Coordination with the regional departments will \nbe undertaken as necessary. Reporting will be done on semiannual basis to the Director of the \nEnergy, Transport, and Water Division (RSID), who may call for a meeting to discuss progress \nand planned activities. Wider communication will take place through the community of practice. \nThe TA will be implemented over 24 months, from April 2007 to March 2009. \n \n                                                 \n13 A \u201cno objection\u201d from the respective Governments of the countries where these training programs will be conducted \nwill be secured before commencing any activity. \n14 A \u201cno objection\u201d from the respective Governments of the countries where these workshops will be conducted will be \nsecured before any activity is begun. \n ", "6   \n20.  About 25 person-months of international and 26 person-months of national consultants\u2019 \ntime  will  be  needed  to  implement  the  activities  of  the  TA.  Individual  consultants  will  be \ncontracted based on their qualifications for the assignment. The qualifications required will be \nestablished in consultation with the network members, based on their specific needs. The \nrequired areas of expertise may include, but will not be limited to (i) institutional, organizational, \nand sector restructuring; (ii) operation and engineering; (iii) nonrevenue water reduction; (iv) \ninternal controls and financial management; (v) procurement and contract management; and (vi) \npersonnel  management.  Additional  international  and  national  resource  persons  may  be \nengaged to fill specific gaps in designing and implementing twinning arrangements, and in \nundertaking discrete training programs. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  Outline terms of reference for consultants are shown in Appendix 3. Equipment and \nmaterials financed by the TA, such as computers and printers, will be procured by the networks \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). \nOwnership of the equipment and materials that have been purchased for specific activities in the \ncourse of networking activities or twinning arrangements implementation will be transferred to \nthe networks after TA completion.  \n \nIV.
