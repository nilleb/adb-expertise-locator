The  Government  of  India  has  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to strengthen the capacities of Indian cities and states to promote \ninclusive urban development. The ADB country strategy and program update, 2006\u20132008, for \nIndia emphasizes supporting urban infrastructure development, especially water supply and \nsewerage, with targeted poverty reduction components and a strong focus on municipal reforms \nand capacity building.1 The proposed TA is closely linked to the ADB country strategy for urban \ninfrastructure development and poverty reduction2 and is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2008\u20132010, for India for 2008.3 \n \n2.  A fact-finding mission visited India from 21 to 23 April 2008 to formulate the proposed \nTA.4 The mission met the secretary, the joint secretary and senior officials of the Ministry of \nHousing  and  Urban  Poverty  Alleviation  (MHUPA)  in  New  Delhi;  urban  specialists  of  other \nmultilateral and bilateral development partners; experts from academia; and other urban poverty \nexperts. Based on these discussions and a review of related documents and lessons learned \nfrom earlier ADB urban infrastructure projects in India, the mission reached an understanding \nwith the Government on the purpose, output, methodology, key activities, cost estimates and \nfinancing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \n(Appendix 1). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Urban Poverty. Rapid urbanization in India has increased the absolute number of urban \npoor. In 2004\u20132005, the number of urban poor in India was about 80.8 million (25.7% of the \nurban population).5 Most live in overcrowded housing conditions with very poor access to basic \nservices and their lives are characterized by: (i) lack of tenure, poor quality shelter without \nownership  rights,  no  access  to  individual  water  connection  and/or  toilets,  unhealthy  and \nunsanitary living conditions; (ii) irregular and/or casual employment, lowly paid work, lack of \naccess to credit on reasonable terms or to formal safety net programs, low ownership of \nproductive  assets,  poor  net  worth,  and  legal  constraints  to  self-employment;  \n(iii)  low levels of education, lack of skills, low social capital and/or caste status, inadequate \naccess to food security programs, lack of access to health services, and  exclusion from local \ninstitutions; and (iv) vulnerability to violence or intimidation, lack of information, and lack of \naccess to justice. \n \n4.  Living Conditions of the Urban Poor. Surveys of urban poor households in India have \nshown that access to piped water supply varies between 15% and 48%.6 The remaining \nhouseholds depend on various other untreated sources of water supply. A significant proportion \nof slum dwellers often resort to open defecation. Most slum and squatter settlements lack \nunderground  sewerage  systems  and  have  inadequate  above  ground  systems  and  road \ndrainage. Wastewater tends to collect in low-lying areas and open drains, providing a breeding \nground for vector-borne diseases. During the monsoon season, roads and pathways without \ndrainage become flooded, impeding access to housing and posing a health risk to inhabitants.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

Goal 11 is to achieve, by 2020, a significant improvement in the \nlives of at least 100 million slum dwellers, which the TA aims to facilitate. \n3 ADB. 2007.

Waste collection services are highly uneven, with services focused on city centers and \ncommercial districts. They rarely reach slum areas, so most households dispose of their solid \nwaste by throwing it into the street, public spaces or drains. The urban poor have limited \nentitlements, laws, and support systems for their working and living conditions. They also lack \ninformation and understanding of their entitlements and often cannot afford the means to use \nthem. They are rarely formally involved in the decision-making process for planning and service \nprovision. They are often victims of illegal elements.  \n \n6.  Government of India\u2019s Urban Poverty Alleviation Initiatives. In December 2005, the \nGovernment launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) to \nrespond to the massive problems of poor urban infrastructure and lack of basic services for the \nurban poor. The JNNURM has two sub-missions. The first addresses urban infrastructure and \ngovernance and the second focuses on Basic Services for the Urban Poor,7 the flagship \nprogram for urban poverty alleviation in India implemented by the MHUPA.8 The main thrust of \nsub-mission II is integrated development to improve or rehabilitate slums by providing shelter; \nbasic services such as water supply, sewerage, drains and/or storm water drains; solid waste \nmanagement; community toilets and/or baths; street lighting; and related civic amenities such as \ncommunity halls and child care centres for the urban poor. Sub-mission II also supports projects \nto build affordable houses for the urban poor and people living on low incomes. In addition, the \nIntegrated Housing and Slum Development Program strives for holistic slum development with a \nhealthy and enabling urban environment by providing adequate shelter and basic infrastructure \nfacilities in specified urban areas.  \n \n7.  Challenges, Constraints and Gaps. Programs for urban poverty alleviation often suffer \nfrom  faulty  or  inadequate  targeting  of  the  poor,  inefficient  management,  weak  institutional \nmechanisms, and leakage of resources. Planning and implementing urban poverty reduction \nprograms have to contend with unreliable and out-of-date information on the urban poor; urban \nplanning that tends to exclude slums because of their illegal status; lack of implementation \ncapacity for poverty reduction programs; lack of professionally qualified people in critical areas \nof municipal management, such as finance and accounting, engineering, public health, urban \nplanning and management; and lack of institutional mechanisms to facilitate participation by the \nurban poor.  \n \n8.  Municipal laws and associated rules and by-laws need to be amended to incorporate \nslum  areas  into  the  planning  process  and  to  provide  services  to  them.  Better  municipal \ngovernance can lead to significant urban poverty reduction. Another constraint is the reluctance \nof finance institutions to lend to low-income communities for micro-enterprises and for skill \ndevelopment programs, even though many low-income households are willing to access market \nfunds. Project design and development capacity constraints further limit the abilities of urban \nlocal bodies to access debt financing.9 There is now an acute awareness of the need to \nenhance  institutional  capacities  and  to  develop  enabling  frameworks  for  urban  poverty \nalleviation. \n \n                                                 \n7  JNNURM has a 7-year timeframe: two fiscal years (FYs) of the 10th Five-Year Plan and the five-year period of the \n11th Plan, i.e. FY2006 to FY2012.   \n8  Basic Services for the Urban Poor aims to improve  slums through integrated  provision of shelter, basic \ninfrastructure and services, and other civic amenities. It has a seven point charter that includes affordable housing \nfor the poor; permanent tenure for slum dwellers; water supply; sanitation; education; health; and social security. \n9  \u201cBankable\u201d projects can be undertaken with debt financing, freeing municipal finances for undertaking pro-poor \ndevelopment work.  \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be inclusive urban development that improves the status of the \nurban poor. The outcome of the TA will be cities and states that are capable of carrying out \ninclusive urban development. Through preparatory tasks and capacity building, the TA will \nfacilitate the development of statewide and citywide inclusive cities pilot projects. Specifically, \nthe TA will focus on developing the capacities of the key stakeholders to: improve physical \ninfrastructure in slums; strengthen basic urban services for the poor; make urban planning and \nmunicipal  financing  more  inclusive;  improve  inclusive  urban  governance  through  municipal \nreforms  and  pro-poor  policies  relating  to  land  tenure;  generate  employment;  and  provide \naffordable housing. The capacity building will support and strengthen ongoing Government \nefforts (para. 6) and facilitate scaling-up of inclusive urban development efforts. The TA will \napply a systematic approach by mainstreaming international and national best practices and \nexperiences into a robust framework and tool kits, which will be used in four cities to develop \npilot projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Given the scale of the urban poverty challenges in India, the TA\u2019s resources are limited. \nHence, it is important to limit the scope of the TA to key areas. The TA will support capacity \nbuilding for inclusive urban development in one city in each of four states. MHUPA is keen to \nassess  relevant  international  experiences  on  inclusive  urban  development,  and  wants  to \nevaluate how global best practices can be incorporated for inclusive urban development. One \nimportant feature of the TA will be to bring international experts with a deep understanding of \nurban poverty issues from countries in the region, including the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nRepublic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand to work with local experts and local institutions in \nIndia.  \n \n11.  However, ensuring sustainability of the TA outputs will be a challenge. Therefore, the TA, \nthrough international and national experts, will support capacity and knowledge building in \nnational institutions and the government. Further engagement of ADB in this key area will be \nbased on an assessment of the extent of the interest in the states and cities to undertake the \nrecommendations  that  emerge  from  the  TA.10  The  Government  has  committed  significant \nbudget resources to the urban poverty alleviation programs, and can sustain the efforts of the \nTA through a network of national institutions and local experts and consultants.  \n \n12.  The TA will have three components.  \n \n13.  Component 1: Develop Tool Kits. This component will support the development of a \nframework and tool kits for designing inclusive urban development projects for Indian cities. The \nframework will be based on international and local best practices11 on (i) inclusive urban \ngovernance and institutional development; (ii) urban planning, including land management for \naffordable housing; (iii) municipal financing with a special emphasis on financing of urban \npoverty  alleviation  and  slum  development  and/or  upgrading;  and  (iv)  slum  and  urban \n                                                 \n10 Project preparatory technical assistance is proposed for 2010 to prepare an urban poverty reduction and inclusive \ndevelopment project. \n11 These include, among others, DFID-supported urban services projects in Andhra Pradesh, Kolkata and Madhya \nPradesh with an emphasis on municipal reforms for inclusive urban development. \n ", "4   \ndevelopment that encourages and enables inclusive urban development. The tool kits will be \ndesigned to provide a systematic approach for cities and states and other interested parties to \ndevelop detailed project reports relating to integrated inclusive urban development programs. \nThe TA will support the development of policies and practices that enable the urban poor to \nimprove their access to market funds. \n \n14.  Component 2: Capacity Building. This component will support capacity building of \nstate and city level stakeholders in inclusive urban development by supporting four national \ntraining institutes from among the National Network of Resource Centers for Urban Poverty and \nSlums, each focusing on one of the four themes identified in component 1 (urban governance, \nurban planning, municipal financing, and slum development).12 The TA will support national and \nstate workshops and training programs.  \n \n15.  Component 3: Pilot Projects. The third component will support the design of four pilot \nprojects  for  inclusive  urban  development,  one  in  each  of  the  four  selected  states.  The \nframework and tool kits developed under component 1 will be used to develop the projects in \nthe cities with assistance from the TA. The process of developing the pilot projects will build \ncapacity. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent. An amount of $1,000,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program and the Government will finance \nthe remaining $250,000 equivalent toward the cost of capacity building, project preparation and \ntraining programs through its national network of resource centers. The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The MHUPA will be the Executing Agency of the TA. It will implement the TA with the \nhelp of a project coordination cell (to be constituted in the MHUPA). A steering committee \nheaded by the joint secretary and the mission director of JNNURM will guide the TA. The \nsteering committee will include representatives from nongovernment organizations, academic \ninstitutions, and representatives of multilateral and bilateral agencies involved in urban poverty \nalleviation  in  India,  including  ADB,  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  and  the \nDepartment for International Development of the UK. The steering committee will meet quarterly \nto review the progress of the TA. The joint secretary and mission director of JNNURM will also \nbe the project director of the TA, and a senior officer from the MHUPA will be assigned as the \nproject coordinator to assist the project director in the implementation of the TA.  \n \n18.  To achieve the project outcomes, the TA will support 8 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 120 person-months of national consulting services (the details of which \nare set out in the Appendix 3). The TA will support four national institutions and the project \ncoordination cell in MHUPA. The Four selected national institutions will support one of the four \nthemes:  (i)  urban  governance  and  institutional  development;  (ii)  urban  planning  and  land \nmanagement for affordable housing; (iii) municipal finance and urban poverty alleviation; and  \n(iv) slum development, housing and inclusive urban development. The four national institutes \n                                                 \n12 Four national institutions are targeted for capacity building in line with MHUPA\u2019s strategy to develop a network of \ninstitutions on a thematic and geographical basis. Institutes that already specialize in the respective theme will be \nprovided support to develop further capacities in inclusive city development and urban poverty alleviation.  \n ", "  5\nwill be selected by the steering committee. The steering committee will also select the four cities \nin each of the selected states for project development activities under component 3.  \n \n19.  The consultants will be hired partly through a firm and partly on an individual basis in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Support for MHUPA\u2019s project coordination cell (72 person-months of national consultants) \nwill be recruited through a national consultancy firm. All the international consultants (8 person- \nmonths) and the national consultants supporting the four national institutions (48 person-months) \nwill be hired on an individual basis. The consultant firm will be selected on a quality- and cost-\nbasis based on a simplified technical proposal. Office equipment and materials to be financed \nby  the  TA  will  be  procured  using  the  shopping  method,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to time). At the end of the TA, the \nprocured equipment will belong to the government agency that has been using it. To facilitate \nimplementation, the TA will use an advance payment facility for training, seminars, conferences \nand  surveys.  ADB  and  EA  approval  will  be  required  before  any  payment  is  made  under \nprovisional sum items. The amount of the advance and its liquidation will be arranged in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants. TA implementation will \nlast 28 months, from January 2009 to April 2011 (Appendix 4). \n \n20.  The following international consultants will be engaged for the TA on an individual basis:  \n(i) urban governance and institutional development expert (2 person-months); (ii) urban planning, \nland management for affordable housing expert (2 person-months); (iii) municipal finance and \nurban poverty alleviation expert (2 person-months); and (iv) slum development, housing and \ninclusive urban development expert (2 person-months). The following national consultants will \nbe  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  to  support  the  four  national  institutions:  \n(i)  urban  governance  and  institutional  development  expert  (12  person-months);  (ii)  urban \nplanning, land management for affordable housing expert (12 person-months); (iii) municipal \nfinance and urban poverty alleviation expert (12 person-months); and (iv) slum development, \nhousing and inclusive urban development expert (12 person-months). The following consultants \nwill be selected through a firm to support the project coordination cell and overall coordination of \nthe  TA:  (i)  urban  poverty,  basic  services  and  livelihood  expert  (24  person-months);  (ii) \nknowledge resource management expert (24 person-months); and (iii) management information \nsystem, monitoring and evaluation expert (24 person-months). All individual consultants will \nsubmit inception, midterm, and final reports. The consultant firm hired to support the project \ncoordination cell will submit (i) an inception report, including a detailed work plan within 4 weeks \nof being engaged; (ii) a midterm report, including an inclusive urban development framework \nand inclusive urban development project preparation tool kits within 8 months of being engaged; \nand (iii) a draft final report, within 18 months of being engaged, which will include copies of four \npilot projects.   \n \nIV.
