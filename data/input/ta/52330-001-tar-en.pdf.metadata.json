INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry \n(MMHI) in increasing transparency and public engagement in the extractive industry. This will \nimprove governance of the industry, strengthening its contribution to Mongolia\u2019s development and \nimprove its attractiveness to prospective investors. This request is in line with objective 2 of the \ngovernment\u2019s  Mongolia  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030  strategy  to  encourage  a \ntransparent and accountable extractive industry and improve the competitiveness of mining.1 \nThrough  the  TA,  ADB  will  enhance  engagement  by  Mongolia  in  the  Extractive  Industries \nTransparency Initiative (EITI), increase public awareness of and engagement in mining activities, \nand provide guidance on legislative changes.2 The TA is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2019\u20132021.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s extractive industry has grown rapidly since 2000, and now accounts for about \n90% of Mongolia\u2019s exports and at least 24% of fiscal revenues. Mongolia also has vast untapped \npotential in coal and mineral resources. The country has about 10% of known global coal reserves \nand the world\u2019s fourth-largest copper reserves, among many other minerals. After initial success \nin the 2000s in developing the extractive industry through foreign investment, the industry\u2019s \ncomplexity has grown considerably. This is understandable as it brings together several layers of \ngovernment,  international  and  domestic  private  sector,  as  well  as  civil  society  and  local \ncommunities. Such a sector requires a clear vision with broad buy-in that reflects the current \nsituation in the sector and a transparent and rules-based legislative framework that underpins the \nrights of local communities, business and other stakeholders. \n \n3.  The industry lacks a consolidated and coordinated policy. The government\u2019s most recent \nattempt to craft such a policy\u2014the state minerals policy, 2014\u20132025\u2014has been stalled by \nnumerous  changes  within  the  MMHI  and  is  effectively  dormant.4  The  industry\u2019s  legislative \nframework hinges on different laws that are perceived as being inconsistent and outdated. \nDevelopment  partners  have  provided  significant  support  and  advice  to  the  government  to \nstrengthen legislation, including preparing drafts of a new mining law and draft amendments to \nthe minerals law. Approval of these updates is awaiting consensus among stakeholders about a \ncommon vision for the industry. The system for allocating mineral revenues between the central \nand local governments is opaque and poorly understood. The system is supposed to allocate \nfunds to local governments based on development needs, and to favor aimags (provinces) with \nmining projects. However, funding from the General Local Development Fund, where these \nrevenues are pooled, decreased dramatically after 2015, and it is generally believed that the \nsystem fails to incentivize aimags to encourage mining investment. \n \n4.  Mongolia has made good progress in transparency. Mongolia first started implementing \nthe EITI standard in 2006 and is one of six countries (out of 51) that meet all EITI requirements. \n                                                \n1  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030. Ulaanbaatar. \n2  The EITI sets a global standard for good governance in oil, gas, and mineral resources and has 51 member countries.  \n3  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2019\u20132021. Manila. The business plan lists the TA project \nname as Develop an Information System to Strengthen Governance of Extractive Sector. The name has been \nchanged in agreement with the government to better reflect the scope, which will include more than just information \nsystems. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 April 2019. \n4  Government of Mongolia. 2014. The State Policy of Mongolia in Respect of the Minerals Sector for 2014\u20132025. \nUlaanbaatar. \n ", "2 \nHowever, this momentum appears to have stalled. Oversight of the National EITI Secretariat was \ntransferred from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to the MMHI in 2018 but without adequate budgetary \nallocations.  World  Bank  funding  for  the  secretariat  ended  in  2018,  leaving  the  secretariat \nunfunded. For Mongolia to continue to meet EITI requirements, the country needs to make \nprogress on transparency of beneficial ownership and contracts by 2020, before validation by the \ninternational EITI secretariat in 2021.5 Political support to require companies to publish more \ninformation on beneficial ownership\u2014a requirement that was introduced as part of the new EITI \nstandard in 2016\u2014is uncertain. \n \n5.  A  multistakeholder  group  composed  of  government,  civil  society,  and  business \nrepresentatives oversees the national EITI process. The group has highlighted the importance of \nstrengthening engagement with the EITI as growing complexity in the extractive industry, coupled \nwith hotly contested elections scheduled for June 2020, make it difficult to muster political support \nfor initiatives like the EITI. Accordingly, the MMHI has approached the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD) and ADB to help fund EITI secretariat costs up to 2021. \nMeanwhile  the government  will  cover  an  increasing  share  of  EITI  secretariat  costs  before \nassuming full coverage in 2022. This is an opportunity to build momentum for the EITI by \nstrengthening  the  legal  status  of  the  initiative,  avoiding  future  disruptions,  and  increasing \ntransparency to improve trust in the industry. ADB has been an EITI partner organization since \n2008, and its support for the EITI in Mongolia will build on its support for EITI initiatives in other \ndeveloping member countries.6 \n \n6.  Public perception of the extractive industry in Mongolia has been deteriorating. More than \n75% of the population view corruption as common in Mongolia, with mining regularly cited as one \nof the main problem areas.7 In part this is because of a lack of public understanding of the \nextractive industry, and the failure of the extractive industry to engage the public in projects that \ndirectly  affect  them.  Furthermore,  confusion  over  how  the  central  government  and  local \ngovernments share responsibility for the industry fuels a perception that the industry is opaque \nand difficult to engage with. Some mining companies do try to ensure that local populations benefit \nfrom their presence, but this is not systematic or well regulated. Nonetheless, opportunities exist \nto  improve  information  dissemination  and  public  monitoring  of  activities  in  the  industry.8 \nOpportunities include (i) the Computerized Mining Cadaster System; (ii) Mongolia\u2019s Geological \nInformation  Catalogue  System  or  MonGeoCat,  a  publicly  accessible  metadata  catalog  of \ngeological data and maps; (iii) InfoRep, an e-reporting system for exploration and production; and \n(iv) the EITI e-reporting system. Improving the quality and transparency of information available \nto citizens will increase public understanding and make it easier for the public to engage with \nthe industry. \n \n7.  Growing  opaqueness  and  complexity  threatens  to  slow  down  development  of  the \nextractive industry. Upstream development has already stalled: New exploration licenses are not \nbeing awarded and once the large Oyu Tolgoi copper mine moves into production in 2020 or \n2021, the pipeline for major mining projects will dry up entirely. Unless Mongolia creates a mining \nindustry  that  engages  communities  and  presents  investors  with  a  transparent  and  stable \n                                                \n5  A beneficial owner in respect of a company is the natural person(s) who directly or indirectly ultimately owns or \ncontrols the corporate entity. \n6  EITI. Partner Organisations. EITI partner organizations \u201cprovide support for good governance in the extractives \nsector, especially related to EITI international activities, and technical, financial and political support for in-country \nimplementation and training.\u201d \n7  The Asia Foundation. 2018. Survey on Perceptions and Knowledge of Corruption. Ulaanbaatar. \n8  Support was provided by the World Bank, the Australian government, the EBRD, and the Federal Institute for \nGeosciences and Natural Resources of the Government of Germany. \n ", "3 \nenvironment, mining will eventually cease to be a driver of development. Supporting the EITI \nalone will not resolve the many challenges that threaten the extractive industry, but the EITI allows \nADB, as Mongolia\u2019s largest development partner, to involve the government, business, and civil \nsociety in its support. The EITI also provides ADB with an opportunity to better understand this \ncritical  industry  in  Mongolia  and  explore  ways  to  work  with  the  government  to  improve \nmanagement of the industry. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  transparency,  accountability,  and \ncompetitiveness of the extractive industry improved (footnote 1). The TA will have the following \noutcome: extractive industry governance improved.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Commitment to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative standard \nmaintained and improved. The TA will support the government and the EITI secretariat to \nimplement the EITI work plan\u2014the implementation document of the EITI process in Mongolia that \nwill support the country\u2019s adherence to the EITI standard. Support will include recruiting and \npaying secretariat staff and covering secretariat costs until the end of 2021, in partnership with \nthe EBRD, which will provide funding until August 2019, and the government, which will cover an \nincreasing proportion of secretariat costs before assuming full coverage in 2022. Through this \noutput, the multistakeholder group overseeing the EITI process will receive support to create a \nlong-term  institutional  arrangement  for  the  EITI  secretariat  that  will  prevent  future \nfunding disruptions.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Legislation to improve transparency in the extractive industry identified. \nThrough the TA, ADB will review legislation and structures in consultation with other industry \nstakeholders. ADB will propose draft legislation to improve transparency in the industry and \nstrengthen the legal basis of the EITI secretariat. \n \n11.  Output 3: Review of opportunities for better information dissemination and public \nmonitoring of extractive industry activities conducted. Under this output, ADB will review \nexisting information systems and reports and identify ways to improve how they are used. ADB \nwill then work with the government to communicate information on extractive industry activities to \nthe public through publications and other means. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $888,200, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff remuneration, office space, logistics and administrative support, \ndomestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. In addition, the government will also \nfinance and administer a cash contribution of $338,200, separate from ADB\u2019s fund flow. Key \nexpenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2021. MMHI will be the \nexecuting agency and the implementing agency. The Mongolia Resident Mission (MNRM) will \nlead the TA and will take a one-ADB approach in this TA by working closely with relevant ADB \ndepartments. The multistakeholder working group that oversees the EITI process in Mongolia will \noversee and provide guidance for the TA project. The resident mission will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants in consultation with the MMHI and the EITI working group; and procure \ngoods. Consultants will organize and deliver project activities, including organizing workshops. \nThere will be at least three workshops (inception, midterm, and final) in addition to planned \ncapacity development under the TA. \n \n14.  TA  support  for  workshops  may  include  costs  related  to  venues,  equipment  rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, meals, transport, lodging, logistics and administrative support, \nand other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with standard ADB procedures, \nthe TA will not support the (i) executing agency\u2019s management fees and related costs such as \nstaff  salaries  and  allowances;  and  (ii)  use  of  executing  agency  resources  such  as  office \naccommodation, which will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. The executing \nagency will provide office space and additional equipment. It will also provide access to utilities \nand telecommunication, including a broadband internet connection, for individual consultants. It \nwill supply data and documents as required under the TA and will cover the cost of office utilities \nfor  consultants.  To  maximize  the  effectiveness  of  TA  activities,  the  executing  agency  will \ndesignate a TA focal point with strong English-speaking and writing skills to facilitate TA activities \nand links to local government representatives and other stakeholders. \n \n15.  The executing agency will establish a separate advance payment facility in United States \ndollars at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB in coordination with the Ministry of Finance, \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). This will be used to pay for workshops and training, surveys, publication of reports, and \nequipment costs. ADB assesses the executing agency as having the financial management \ncapacity and internal controls to maintain records. \n \n16.
