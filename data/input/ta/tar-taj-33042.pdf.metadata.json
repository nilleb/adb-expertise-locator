During the 2005 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Tajikistan requested \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  the \nGovernment implement the Farm Debt Resolution Strategy1 for cotton farms. The TA2 was \nincluded in the country program for 2005, and the Department for International Development \n(DFID) will provide grant support.3 A fact-finding mission4 visited Tajikistan from 28 April to 10 \nMay  2005  to  hold  discussions  and  to  draw  up  and  confirm  with  the  Government  the  TA \nobjectives, scope, costs, implementation, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The \nmission met with key stakeholders, including the Government, creditors, and farmers, and drew \non participatory fieldwork on farm debt, completed in March 2005, with creditors and farmers.5 \nThe  TA  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  Independent  Commission  (IC)  in  pilot-testing  debt \nresolution methodology for heavily indebted cotton farms, and in finalizing the methodology and \nfarm  debt  database  required  by  the  commission  to  implement  the  action  plan.  The  TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Tajikistan  is  predominantly  agricultural.  In  2004,  agriculture  contributed  22%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), provided 20% of export revenues, and employed 52% \nof the labor force. Cereal and cotton are the primary crops, and cotton is the only significant \nagriculture export. Cotton production generates about 20% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange \nearnings, occupies more than three fourths of irrigated farmland, and supports around three \nfourths of farm households. Although the poverty line is not officially defined, statistics indicate \nthat rural income poverty is widespread and severe, especially in cotton-growing areas.6 \n3.  Seed cotton production declined by 56%, from a high of 1 million tons in 1980 to 557,000 \ntons in 2004. Average cotton yield has plummeted from 2.8 tons per hectare (tph) in 1990 to 1.9 \ntph in 2004. This is 0.6 tph short of the yield required to ensure normal profits and 1.3 tph short \nof worldwide average yields. Labor productivity has also fallen and is now less than 25% of the \ncompetitive level. Input use has been suboptimal because of untimely input delivery, rise in \ninput costs, poor input quality, and lack of access to appropriate forms of credit. The combined \nresult of the erosion in factor productivity is significant farm financial losses; generally, the larger \nthe farm the greater the losses.  \n4.  Other factors underpin the poor performance of cotton farms. The most important ones \noutside farmer control are the farm cotton production quota; interference of the hukumats (local \ngovernment  officials)  in  day-to-day  farm  decision  making;  lack  of  a  system  to  mortgage \nagricultural land; lack of competition in the input, output, and credit markets; weak banking \nprocedures and practices; and deteriorating irrigation and drainage facilities. The factors internal \nto the farms include inappropriate farm ownership and management structures, lack of farm \nmanagement skills, and incompetent and corrupt farm management.  \n                                                 \n1  Presidential Order 12.2 (4 March 2005). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on May 19, 2005. \n3  $800,000 will be provided under the Poverty Reduction Fund. \n4  The  mission  included  B.  Wilkinson,  team  leader,  and  L.  Adriano,  poverty  reduction  specialist,  Agriculture, \nEnvironment, and Natural Resources Division, East and Central Asia Department.  \n5  ADB. 2004. Study on Socio Economic Issues of Indebted Cotton Farms of Irrigation Rehabilitation Project Areas. \nManila.  \n6 World Bank. 2005.  Republic of Tajikistan Poverty Assessment Update, 30853-TJ. Washington DC. This study \nindicated that overall poverty decreased from 81% in 1999 to 64% in 2003. However, the Khatlon and Sughd \nregions, which produce 85% of the country\u2019s cotton and are home to 65% of the population, accounted for 76% of \nall poor households and 72% of all extremely poor households. Khatlon and Sughd recorded the highest per capita \nGDP growth rates in 2003 but also had the largest proportion of poor households. \n ", "2   \n5.  Seasonal cotton lending practices have been unrelated to either farm profitability or true \nproduction costs, and represent an incomplete transition from the Soviet system. The formal \ncotton creditors are largely local investors who provide supplier credit in kind and are repaid in \ncotton. There is virtually no other source of farm credit in the country. Farmers have viewed \ncotton as their key production option, as it brought with it the only source of agricultural input \nsupply or production resources. Lending continued even when profitability (and thus repayment) \nwas questionable. Farmers borrowed even when it was clear that they could not repay. There \nare questions regarding the inputs and outputs pricing and delivery from creditors, and the \ninputs and credit use by farmers. The consequence is a large and increasing accumulation of \nbad debt in the sector, significantly constraining overall progress.  \n6.  In 2004, ADB7 completed a comprehensive study of cotton farm debt. It documented \n$240 million in estimated unpaid debt (principal and accumulated interest) as of January 2004. \nOf this amount, approximately $180 million is due to formal creditors, rather than overdue \npayments for electricity, water, and salaries. About 108 of the large cotton farms account for \n70% of the debt. The unpaid cotton debts are closely associated with low productivity and poor \nprofitability. The TA workshop in 2004 spurred engagement of other funding agencies. The \nWorld  Bank,    the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  and  the \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) studies deepened the ADB finding that for the \nagriculture sector, particularly cotton, to be more productive and profitable and reduce poverty, \nan integrated approach is required that includes reforms in policy, institutions, and structures at \nthe farm level. While the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) and the Government had started \naddressing cotton debt default, the ad hoc nature of the process provided insufficient results. A \nunified approach was clearly demanded, one that required a four-way arrangement between \nfarmers, creditors, the Government, and funding agencies. \n7.  The Government has responded to this significant challenge. On 4 March 2005, the \nPresident of Tajikistan approved the Cotton Farm Debt Resolution Strategy. It has a two-part \napproach to facilitating debt workouts between private lenders and private borrowers. One part \nfocuses on short-term measures to ensure fair and equitable resolution of the debt on a farm-\nby\u2013farm basis. The second part focuses on the medium-term policy, legal, and institutional \nmeasures to enable a properly functioning cotton market. These reforms include such complex \nareas as land reform and farm privatization. The strategy calls for the establishment of the IC to \noversee implementation. \n8.  The IC was established in May 2005, including senior ministers, representatives of two \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the World Bank and ADB resident representatives. \nCommissioners developed the terms of reference, action plan, and guiding principles during an \nADB-led, multidonor-funded retreat. The first priority of the action plan is the startup of the debt \nanalysis and workout strategy for each farm. The most crucial step now is to commence farm \ndebt reviews on an initial subset of heavily indebted farms, as they hold more than two thirds of \nthe farm debt and employ a large proportion of the impoverished cotton workforce. Based on the \ninitial farm debt reviews, standardized farm debt review and restructuring protocols can be \nestablished  for  use  on  all  other  farms.  A  database  can  also  be  established,  using  data \ngenerated in the farm reviews and incorporating information from a variety of sources, to track \nprogress and provide a starting point for the farm-by-farm reviews. The TA will provide technical \nsupport in these important initial tasks. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms. \nManila  (TA 4052-TAJ, approved on 18 December 2002, for $960,000). \n ", "  3\n9.  The funding agency community has given overwhelming support to help the Government \nresolve the cotton farm debt, especially if it leads to much-needed policy and institutional \nreforms.  Bilateral  and  multilateral  organizations  have  agreed  to  work  in  concert  to  ensure \nsynergy in their efforts. This will be particularly important as cotton yields must be increased and \nsome land shifted to other uses to ensure sustainable land practices and long-term profitable \nfarming. The ADB Farm Productivity Project8 and other planned funding agency activities will \nsupport the ongoing farm-by-farm analysis to be developed under this TA. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA\u2019s impact is to ensure that farm debt is resolved under the Government\u2019s Farm \nDebt  Resolution  Strategy.  The  TA\u2019s  outcome  is  to  ensure  that  the  governing  body  for \nimplementation of the strategy, the IC, establishes fair, timely, and systematic mechanisms to \nresolve farm debt on each farm. The TA is expected to result in farm analyses and farmer \nawareness work being completed on a schedule agreed on among farmers, creditors, and the \nIC, and about 50% of indebted farms finalizing debt workout arrangements within 5 years of TA \ncompletion. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The proposed TA will  \n \n(i)  perform a detailed analysis of debt circumstances and farmer awareness for up \nto 10 major farms, and facilitate debt workout; \n(ii)  develop standard farm analysis and farmer awareness protocols for use by the \nIC on subsequent farms scheduled for farm debt resolution; and \n(iii)  develop a database for ongoing farm debt monitoring. \n \n12.  The debt resolution process to date has demonstrated that information on actual debts \nand the capacity of farms to service debts is not sufficient to arrange debt workouts. Additional \non-farm production, management, and account data are needed to determine debt-restructuring \noptions for each farm. The farmers\u2019 understanding of their right to borrow and responsibility to \nrepay loans is insufficient. To start farm-by-farm resolution, expert teams need to complete \nanalysis and awareness raising on a first set of farms in cotton raions (districts).9 After the \nanalysis and awareness raising on the initial farms is completed and results are shared with \nstakeholders, the teams will facilitate mediated solutions wherever possible, or refer the parties \nto arbitration if a solution cannot be found. \n \n13.  Key activities under the farm analysis and awareness segment will include the following:  \n \n(i)  Determine the most appropriate farms for review. \n(ii)  Agree with the IC on the initial methodology and key concerns. \n(iii)  Meet with creditors and farmers to explain the process and get concurrence on \n(a) debt and farm operational analysis and information access, and (b) farmers\u2019 \nawareness of their rights and responsibilities, particularly for women. \n(iv)  Conduct both parts of the farm review. \n                                                 \n8  In development, $6.5 million grant and $5.5 million loan, anticipated for mid-2006. \n9  The farms to be analyzed will be determined at the start of the TA based on the action plan of the Independent \nCommission, the priority of the 108 most heavily indebted farms as per TA 4052-TAJ and subsequent information \nof the NBT. \n ", "4   \n(v)  Present the initial findings to creditors and farmers along with options for debt \nresolution.  This  may  involve  IC  visits  to  the  farms,  and  funds  have  been \nbudgeted for this cost. \n(vi)  Facilitate any mediation process to encourage the parties to resolve the debt. If \nnot feasible, refer them to arbitration or court settlement. \n(vii)  Document the entire process, including lessons learned.  \n \n14.  While protocols for debt workout are standard internationally, circumstances specific to \nTajikistan require testing and consideration of a range of options before protocols can be \nfinalized. This process will take place in the farm-by-farm analysis and awareness raising under \nthis TA. Based on the experiences of that process and drawing on recent work10 completed by \nother funding agencies, the TA team will complete a set of operating protocols to continue the \nfarm-by-farm analysis and awareness raising on all subsequent farms. These protocols will be \nvalidated by key stakeholder groups and then confirmed by the IC as their standard. In this way, \nthe process can continue consistently and enable rapid, fair, and final completion of debt \nworkouts on other farms. \n \n15.  Key activities under the protocols development will include the following: \n \n(i)  Based on the farm analysis of up to 10 farms and previous work done by other \nfunding  agencies  and  NBT,  review  lessons  learned,  and  establish  draft \nguidelines  and  internal  checks  for  (a)  debt  and  farm  operational  analysis, \nrecommendations, and mediation; and (b) awareness by farmers of their rights \nand responsibilities. \n(ii)  Review draft guidelines with sets of stakeholders, including creditors, farmers, \ncourt officials, NBT, and tax offices, and revise them. \n(iii)  Review the draft guidelines with IC and finalize them. \n(iv)  Develop  operational  procedures  for  guidelines  for  farm-by-farm  analysis  and \nraising farmers\u2019 awareness. \n \n16.  While KreditInvest, NBT, and the Ministry of Agriculture have databases, recent work \n(footnote 7) suggests that the data on individual farms in these databases do not match the on-\nfarm records. To ensure that debt workouts are documented and the process of resolution \ntracked (particularly as farms are privatized and broken down into smaller units) a database \nmust be established and maintained.  \n \n17.  Key activities under the database establishment will involve the following: \n \n(i)  Assess  database  needs,  including  levels  of  security  and  maintenance \nrequirements for backup, updating, and staff training. \n(ii)  Review databases and downloading options. Determine if they can be modified \nrather than establish a new system. \n(iii)  Procure database hardware and software and establish the system. \n(iv)  Download  and  input  data  from  credible  sources  and  cross-check  them  for \naccuracy. \n(v)  Train staff in database management, security, updating, and reporting. \n(vi)  Arrange for periodic technical support. \n \n                                                 \n10  DFID-UGAgroFund. 2005.

The total TA cost is estimated to be $945,000 equivalent, including contingencies and \nexpected contributions from the Government, comprising $360,000 of foreign exchange cost \nand $585,000 equivalent of local currency cost. ADB will provide $800,000 equivalent to cover \nthe entire foreign exchange cost and $440,000 equivalent of local costs. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and administered by ADB. The \nGovernment will provide $145,000 equivalent to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services, \nincluding  provision  of  necessary  data,  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  administrative \nsupport (equivalent to about 15% of the total TA cost). The cost estimates and financing plan is \nin Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Office of the President will be the Executing Agency for the TA. In cooperation with \nthe IC and relevant raion offices, it will provide office accommodation for the team to work with \nIC or other relevant Government officials, sufficient office furniture, electricity, cooling, heating, \nand two telephone lines; counterpart staff to work with the consultants  and liaise with local \nfinancing institutions, local administrations, investors, farmers, and farm workers; workshop and \nmeeting  facilities,  including  arrangements  for  participation  of  government  agencies  and \nstakeholders;  and  logistical  support  in  districts  (facilitate  accommodation,  local  staff,  local \ntransport,  etc.).  The  Office  of  the President must  cooperate  closely  with  NBT\u2019s  offices  on \nresolving farm debt. \n \n20.  The TA will engage two international consultants for a total of 8 person-months as a farm \nmanagement specialist (4 person-months) and a cotton production specialist (4 person-months). \nTen domestic consultants (for 63 person-months) will be recruited: legal counsel (7 person-\nmonths), accountant (7 person-months), social scientist (8 person-months), farm management \nspecialist (8 person-months), land management specialist (6 person-months), two bookkeeping \nand analysts (6 person-months each, total 12 person-months), database specialist (6 person-\nmonths),  farmer  awareness  specialist  (5  person-months),  and  cotton  specialist  (4  person-\nmonths). A firm will be recruited under quality-and cost-based selection (simplified technical \nproposal) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consulting Services. Equipment \n(database  computer  and  software,  notebook  computers,  printers,  facsimile  machines,  and \nphotocopiers) and a vehicle will be procured by the Office of the President in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and will remain with the IC on completion.  \n \n21.  The consultants will submit, in Russian and English, (i) inception reports 2 weeks after \ntheir services start, (ii) interim progress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation, \n(iii) draft final reports before the contract ends, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after incorporating \nthe ICs\u2019 and ADB's comments. The TA is expected to start in November 2005 and to be \ncompleted on or before October 2006. Outputs and outcomes will be disseminated widely by the \nIC, its donor and NGO members, and the NGO and donor community through workshops and \nmedia presentations. \n \nIV.
