Weaknesses  in  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  oversight  framework  for  the  Indonesian\nfinancial  sector  encouraged  (i)  overleveraging  and  overexposure  to  domestic  and  offshore\nborrowings,  and  (ii) the  formation  of financial  groups  that  engaged  in  connected  lending.1 With\ncurrency depreciation and massive reversals in capital outflows in the late 1990s, the financial system\nvirtually  collapsed. To deal with this systemic crisis, over the last three years, the Government of\nIndonesia  has  taken  steps  to  (i) restore  public  confidence  by  providing  guarantees  for  bank\ndepositors, (ii) close nonviable financial institutions, (iii) implement rehabilitation and recapitalization\nprogram for banks, (iv) support the resolution of impaired assets, and (v) strengthen the regulatory\nframework  for  the  capital  market  and  the  insurance  sector.  Building  upon  these  reforms,  the\nGovernment plans to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory regime for the financial sector. As a\nstep in this direction, the Central Bank Law was revised to allow for the establishment of a single\nsupervisory body for banks and nonbank financial institutions (NBFls) named the Financial Services\nSupervisory Institution (FSSI). The Government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to\nprovide technical  assistance  (TA  )2 for the development of the FSSI to consolidate  regulatory and\nsupervisory oversight for the financial sector in an efficient and harmonized manner. ADB fielded a\nfact-finding  mission  in February 2000. A  follow-up  policy consultation  mission  in September  and\nOctober 2000 reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives and scope of the\nproposed TA  , its cost estimates, and implementation arrangements. A TA   framework is provided in\nAppendix1 .\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  In Indonesia, banks are regulated and supervised by the central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI);\nthe  securities  market  by the  Capital  Market Supervisory Agency  (BAPEPAM) that  reports to the\nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF);  and  insurance,  pension, finance  companies,  and the  venture  capital\nindustry by the Directorate General of Financial Institutions (DGFI) in the MOF. These agencies have\nlacked effective governance because of low accountability and the absence of political and financial\nindependence.  The multiple agency structure provides segmented and fragmented  re~ulatory and\nsupervisory oversight and is not conducive to the supervision of financial conglomerates  that (i) own\nindustrial companies,  banks, and other financial companies; and (ii) have engaged in relationship-\nbased borrowing and lending. For instance, a number of commercial banks owned and used finance\ncompanies as vehicles to circumvent lending limits and thus extend their exposures. The growth and\nstructure  of financial  groups  have important risk management and supervision  implications. Weak\ncoordination and information sharing among BI, BAPEPAM, and MOF have made it difficult to assess\nthe consolidated position on risk exposure of market intermediaries. In view of the weaknesses in the\nfinancial  market regulation and supervision, poorly managed financial institutions have taken risky\nasset-liability and currency positions that have resulted in mismatches and liquidity problems.\n3.  Although the regulators and supervisors were aware of these flawed market practices, their\nability  to  take  appropriate  action  was  limited  because  of  political  interference,  weak  incentive\nstructure,  poor  accountability,  and  lack  of  skills  and  immunity  provisions  for  supervisors  and\ninspectors. Post-crisis financial reviews and audits of commercial banks and brokerage firms revealed\nweaknesses in balance sheets and lack of compliance with regulations, although BI and auditors had\nearlier  rated these  institutions  as sound. While the Central Bank Law has made BI independent.\nConnectedl ending refers to (i) lending by banks to their affiliated or subsidiary companies. or (ii) loans directed by bank\ndirectors or shareholders to companies in which they have an interest.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Oppot1unities (Intemet edition) on 22 May 2000.\n3 Both formally and informally integrated financial conglomerates that operate as independent legal entities but tend to be\nowned by members of the same family.", "2\nBAPEPAM  lacks  the  autonomy,  resources,  and  capacity  to  effectively  enforce  laws  and\nregulations or to conduct inspections and investigations of brokerage and securities firms. Although\nMOF has been overseeing the regulation and supervision of the nonbank sector for a long time, it is\nunable to effectively perform this role, given its limited capacity and core mandate of fiscal  policy,\nmanagement and decentralization.\n4.  Recognizing  these  weaknesses  in financial  sector oversight, the Government  enacted  the\nCentral  Bank  Law in May  1999, foreshadowing  the creation of a new, independent  institution  to\nsupervise banks and NBFls. As a preparatory step to establishing the FSSI, BI, with assistance from\nthe  International  Monetary  Fund,  is  implementing  a  Master  Plan  for  Strengthening  Banking\nSupervision  System  for  2000-2002  and  an  action  plan  for  banks  to  comply  with  international\nregulatory  standards.  BI  is  taking  steps  to  strengthen  its  capabilities  in  (i)  commercial  banks\nsurveillance, (ii) problem bank management, (iii) offsite and onsite supervision, and (iv) research and\ntraining. Simultaneously, under ADB's program,4 BAPEPAM and DGFI have (i) introduced risk-based\ncapital requirements for securities and insurance companies, (ii) developed management information\nsystems, (iii) started to strengthen enforcement, inspection, and investigation of market participants;\nand (iv) launched training of staff in these areas. These initiatives will help prepare BAPEPAM and\nDGFI for the eventual consolidation of regulation and supervision functions in the FSSI.\n5.  Indonesia is not unique in having relied on separate agencies to handle the regulation and\nsupervision  of different types of financial  institutions. For instance, the United States has opted to\ncontinue  with  multiple  regulators5 as  the  Glass-Steagall  Act  restricted  commercial  banks  from\nengaging  in other financial activities, particularly investment banking, insurance and other types of\nnonbanking business.  With the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the United States\nadopted  functional  regulation  to  enhance  competition  in  financial  services  and  extended  such\nregulation to the financial conglomerates that the Act permits. The system recognizes that regulatory\nspecialization enhances risk management and supervision of diverse financial service organizations\ncomprising of commercial banks, securities broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other NBFls.\nThe continued existence of separate regulators is justified in the US context given the vast size of the\nfinancial  sector,  high  effectiveness  of  regulators,  their  success  in  interagency  coordination  in\nregulation and supervision, and the constitutional constraint of state jurisdiction over the insurance\nsector.\n6.  Operating with separate regulators in smaller jurisdictions is, however, increasingly difficult as\nthe financial sector becomes more complex, with financial firms fast integrating and extending their\nreach  beyond  national  boundaries.  Potential  inconsistencies  in the  application  of  regulatory  and\nsupervisory  approaches  carry  the  risk  of  regulatory  arbitrage  and  uneven  levels  of  consumer\nprotection. Recently, the move toward consolidated regulatory structures has gained momentum due\nto  the  lifting  of  restrictions  on  capital  movements;  need for  the  effective  regulation  of  financial\nconglomerates with international operations; and blurring of geographical, functional, and institutional .\nboundaries. Under more compartmentalized regulatory structures, financial conglomerates tend to be\nunder-supervised,  resulting  in  regulatory  arbitrage.  A  unified  oversight  agency  encourages\nconsistency  in  regulatory  and supervisory  approaches  and economies of  scale,  since  the  single\nregulator can centralize support services such as premises, human resources, and information. A\n4 Loan No. 1618-INO: Financial GovernanceR  efonns Sector DevelopmentP rogram, for $1,400 million, approved on\n25 June 1998.\n5  These include (i) the three agenciesd ealingw  ith the bankings ector:t he FederalR  eserveB oard,O  ffice of the Comptroller\nof the Currency,a nd the Federal DepositI nsuranceC  orporation;( ii) the SecuritiesE xchangeC ommissiont hat deals with\nsecurities markets regulationa nd supervision;a nd (iii) the state governmentst hat deal with insurance regulationa nd\nsupervision.", "3\nsingle agency for authorization,  supervision, and is simpler and more cost effectivefor\nthe sector.\n7.  The rationale and structure for a consolidated oversight body varies from country to country. In\ndeveloping a suitable structure, Indonesia can draw on the experience of other countries that have\nmoved to a partial, or fully integrated, financial oversight structure. Market factors encouraging the\nmove to such a structure include (i) the size, nature, and practices of the financial sector; (ii) growing\ncompetition, and globalization, technological and financial innovations that have generated new ways\nof separating, repackaging and trading risks, and have weakened the distinction between equity, debt,\nand loans, and even banking and insurance businesses;8 and (iii) removal or weakening of barriers to\nentry,  diversification,7  and  various  ownership  structures.  These  developments  have  blurred\ndistinctions that used to apply to financial institutions, types of product, and distribution channels in\ndifferent countries, albeit to different extents and in different ways. The developments also bring risks\nof multiple gearing, relationship-based  and connected lending, share price manipulation, and other\nunethical practices. Consolidated regulation and supervision helps identify and manage these risks\nbetter.\n8.  There are many models of partly or fully unified financial service regulators and supervisors. At\nthe end of the spectrum  is the United Kingdom, where the government  in the late 1990s opted to\nestablish a single regulator, the Financial Services Authority, to simultaneously exercise prudential\nregulation and supervision of business and market conduct, provide consumer protection, and control\nfinancial crime in different financial institutions. Japan8 and the Republic of Korea followed this model\nwith  variations  in  line  with  their  financial  legislation,  and  market  structure  and  practices.  The\nconsolidation  in financial  oversight  in  these  countries was  driven  by  the  growing  complexity  of\nfinancial  market  problems  following  major  growth  in financial  conglomerates.9 Adopting  a  more\nfunctional  approach,  Australia  has  assigned  the  prudential  regulatory  responsibility  for  banks,\ninsurance companies, and pension funds to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and the\noversight  of  securities  firms  and  market  and  business  conduct  to  the  Australian  Securities\nInvestments  Commission.  Meanwhile,  the  Reserve Bank of Australia  handles  matters  related to\nfinancial stability, and two other agencies handle issues related to market competition and consumer\nprotection. Canada merged banking and insurance regulation and supervision into the Office of the\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions in 1987, but retains separate securities commissions at the\nprovincial  level  to  oversee  capital  market  activities.  Some  smaller  economies,  such  as  the\nScandinavian countries,  moved in the mid-1980s to consolidate their regulation and supervision of\nbanks, and insurance and securities markets, while Singapore and a few other small countries rely on\ncentral banks to oversee the entire financial sector.\n9.  Drawing  on  this  experience,  the  International  Committee  for  Banking  Supervisors  in\nSeptember 2000 concluded that given the diversity and variations in regulatory structures around the\nworld, it is not possible to prescribe \"a one-size-frts all\" model framework. In general, each country has\nevolved its oversight structure for the financial sector based on its market structures and practices.\nFor example, credit derivatives bear many of the characteristics of an insurance product and some insurance companies\n6 \noffer short-term  deposit-like  products.\n7  For instance, a number of groups are authorized to conduct all five of the main financial functions of deposit taking,\ninsurance,  securities,  corporate  finance,  and fund management.\n8  While bank supervision is a legal responsibility of 1he newly-established Financial Services Agency of Japan. the Bank of\nJapan  concurrently  conducts  supervision  of banks  because  under the law it is bound  to conduct  supervision  of entities  that\nmaintain  accounts  with it.\n9 Created  by mergers  and acquisitions  between  banks and securities  firms or banks  and insurance  companies.  and financial\nservices  firms'  extension  of business  through  internal  growth  into new areas.  Examples  are  insurance  companies  setting\nup banks  and  vice  versa,  insurance  companies  selling  investment  products.  banks  setting  up securities  firms  and fund\nmanagers, and retail businesses entering the financial services sector.", "4\nWhile  developing  a  suitable  model,  Indonesia  needs  to  recognize  that  financial  supervision\nrequires a thorough knowledge and understanding of the prudential regulatory framework  and it is\ncritical that regulatory activity feed into supervision. Recognizing this, the Basle Core Principles for\nBanking  Supervision  advocate  that  prudential  regulation  be  an  integral  component  of  financial\nsupervision.  In  view  of  this,  Indonesia  needs  to  consider the  integration  of  the  regulation  and\nsupervisory functions  of the bank and nonbank finance sectors in the FSSI. However, the Central\nBank Law (i) mandates transfer of both bank and nonbank supervision to the FSSI, (ii) stipulates that\nbanking  regulation  be  retained  with  BI,  and  (iii)  is  silent  on  matters  related  to  nonbank  sector\nregulation. Independently of the provisions of this law, Article 8 of the State Guidelines issued by the\nPeoples  Assembly  in  1999  calls  for  capital  markets  to  be  developed  and  supervised  by  an\nindependent body. Given these legislative variances and the complexity of restructuring the oversight\nframework for the financial sector, a Steering Committee1os et up to oversee the formation of the FSSI\nis holding consultations and a workshop (sponsored by ADB) to evaluate the suitability of alternative\nmodels of regulation, supervision,  and enforcement to develop the  most appropriate  structure for\nIndonesia.\nIII. THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\nObjective\n10.  The objective of the proposed TA is to support the development of the FSSI as an effective\noversight  institution  for  the  financial  sector.  The  TA  will  help  develop  a  framework,  law,  and\nregulations for the FSSI to support the eventual establishment of an appropriate financial supervisory\nand regulatory structure that will promote consistency and harmonization of standards across financial\nservices  and  products,  identify  and  address  systemic  risks  peculiar to  financial  conglomerates,\nimprove  transparency  and disclosure  of  information to  market participants, and  support  effective\ncompliancea nd enforcemento f regulatorys tandards.\nB.  Scope\n11.  The establishment of the FSSI is envisaged to take place in two phases. In the first phase, the\nproposed TA  , under the guidance of the Steering Committee and the Executive Group,11 will help in\ndoing the preparatory work for the establishment of the FSSI and examining the need for restructuring\nand strengthening of DGFI and BAPEPAM to facilitate their eventual consolidation into FSSI. In the\nsecond  phase,  drawing  on  the  TA    recommendations,  the  Government  will  establish  and\noperationalize the FSSI and develop its capacities.\n12.  The proposed TA will support the background work during the first phase. In particular, it will\nhelp prepare (i) legislation that defines the FSSI's role, functions, powers, and responsibilities; (ii) a\nproposal  for  an  appropriate  governance  and  organization  structure;  (iii)  internal  governance .\nprocedures and implementation regulations; (iv) terms and conditions (including salary and benefits)\nof FSSI staff; (v) a training needs assessment and training program; (vi) a business plan, including a\nproposal for  a financing  structure;  (vii) supportive  regulations to define coordination  mechanisms,\nincluding  those  for  information  sharing  and  policy consultation  among  BI,  MOF,  and  the  FSSI,\n(viii) amendments  to  key  legislation,  as  appropriate,  to  ensure  its  compatibility  with  the  FSSI's\nindependent status; and (ix) recommendations on accountability and disclosure practices of the FSSI.\n10C omprisingt he CoordinatingM  inister of Economy,M  inister of Finance,G  ovemoro f 81, Minister of Justice, and Cabinet\nSecretary. \n11C omprising the Director General of Financial Institutions from MOF as chairperson, Head of 8APEPAM as Vice\nChairpersona nd representativesfr om 81,M  inistryo f Justice.a nd other relevanta gencies.", "5\nc.\nCost Estimatesa nd FinancingP  lan\n13.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated to be $2,210,000 including a foreign exchange\ncost of $1,245,000 and a local currency cost of $965,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $455,000  equivalent  of the  local currency  cost. The  TA  budget includes  an\nallocation of $150,000 for workshops to solicit views of professional and market participant on the\nlegislation and blueprint for FSSI developed by the team of consultants and provide domestic training\nfor the core staff expected to join the FSSI once it begins operations. In addition, the TA   budget\nincludes $100,000 for the  procurement of hardware and software required for the development of\ndatabases  on  the  various  financial  institutions  that  will  be  under  the  FSSI's  responsibility.  The\nhardware and software financed by the TA   will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on\nProcurement  and other  arrangements  acceptable to ADB,  and transferred  to  DGFI upon the TA \ncompletion. The TA   will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support\nFacility, funded  by the  Government  of Japan.  The Government will  contribute  the  equivalent  of\n$510,000 in kind for counterpart staff, office accommodation, local transportation. training. and office\nsupport facilities. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.\nImplementationA rrangements\n14.  As the Executing Agency for the proposed TA, DGFI will coordinate the work of consultants\nand their interaction with the Steering Committee and Executive Group of the FSSI (para. 11). It is\nestimated that about 25 person-months of international and 36 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices will be required. The international consultants will include experts in (i) financial regulation,\n(ii) bank supervision, (iii) nonbank financial supervision, (iv) pension and insurance, and (v) law. The\ndomestic  consultants  will  have expertise  in bank and NBFI supervision,  insurance and securities\nmarkets,  law,  management.  and  governance.  A  firm will  be  selected  in accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines  on  the  Use of  Consultants  and other arrangements  on the  engagement  of domestic\nconsultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  provided  in  Appendix  3.  The\nconsultants will prepare an inception report defining the role, functions, and organizational structure of\nthe FSSI within two months of the T A commencement. The report will be discussed and agreed upon\nat  a tripartite  meeting  of the  consultants,  the  Government,  and ADB.  A  midterm  review will  be\nconducted to discuss the preliminary findings of the TA  . The consultants will submit a draft final report\nfor review at a tripartite meeting and incorporate comments in the final TA   report for endorsement by\nthe Steering Committee. The T A will commence by April 2001 and end by April 2002.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n15.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance, on a\ngrant basis, to the Government of Indonesia in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,700,000\nfor the purpose of the Development of a Financial Services Supervisory Institution.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICALA  SSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\n.\n.\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 1)", "7\nAppendix 1, page 2", "8\nAppendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian  Development  Bank Financing  (ACCSF)\n1.
