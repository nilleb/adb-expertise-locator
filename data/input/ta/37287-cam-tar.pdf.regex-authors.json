INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2004, the Government of Cambodia requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare a \nproject to reduce poverty in communities inhabiting the lowland areas surrounding the Tonle \nSap lake, in the framework initiated by the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project \n(TSEMP).1 During 8\u201318 February 2005, the Fact-Finding Mission of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) visited Cambodia and formulated the TA, in line with the program of actions \nformalized  in  the  poverty  partnership  agreement  between  the  Government  and  ADB.2 In \nNovember 2005 the Government confirmed its concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, and cost and financing arrangements of the proposed TA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Tonle Sap and Its Resources. The Tonle Sap lake experiences an annual cycle of \nflooding that inundates its extensive peripheral wetlands, and increases the surface area of the \nlake from about 2,500 square kilometers (km2) in the dry season to as much as 16,000 km2 in \nthe wet season. This phenomenon, which results principally from the lake\u2019s interconnection with \nthe Mekong River, generates a high biodiversity of fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, and aquatic \nvegetation. Its fisheries directly support more than a million people and provide the single \nlargest source of protein for Cambodia\u2019s increasing population. In recognition of the lake's \nimportance, a royal decree designated the Tonle Sap as a multiple-use protected area in 1993. \nIts global significance to biodiversity conservation led to declaration of the lake and its wetlands \nas the Tonle Sap biosphere reserve (TSBR) in 1997 under the Man and the Biosphere Program \nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  \n \n3.  Threats to the Tonle Sap. Social upheaval in Cambodia\u2019s not so distant past, high \npopulation growth, and recent (still evolving) changes in the legislative framework governing \nmanagement  of  community  fisheries3 have  coalesced  to  create  conditions  for  disordered \nexploitation, placing severe pressure on the lake\u2019s natural resources. Threats to the lake's \necosystem include overexploitation of fisheries and wildlife resources, conversion of the flooded \nforest to agriculture, and collection of fuelwood from the flooded forest.4 Degradation of natural \nvegetation  in  the  watersheds  is  also  destroying  natural  habitats,  adversely  affecting  water \nquality, and increasing sedimentation in the lake. \n \n4.  Poverty and Vulnerability. Despite the inherent richness of the lake, most indicators of \npoverty in the basin are more negative than those for the nation as a whole, or for other rural \nareas of Cambodia. About 40\u201360% of households in the provinces adjoining the lake are below \nthe official poverty line, with a peak of 80% in some areas. Many households have no land and \nare entirely dependent on fishing and foraging, with access to fishing areas often under dispute. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 16 March 2005. \n3  In 2000, a prime ministerial decree released 56% of the fishing lot area and turned it over to community \nmanagement, a change which, in the long term, should benefit riparian communities, improve fish habitats, and \nlead to sustainable management of natural resources. However, the underlying policy reforms and supportive laws \nand decrees were not put in place, and the communities have not been sufficiently involved in the planning and \nimplementation of the changes. Meeting the basic survival needs of poor inhabitants of the surrounding areas has \ntended to overrule considerations of sound environmental management.  \n4  The area of flooded forest is declining rapidly. In 1997, satellite imagery revealed only about 20,000 hectares (ha) \nof flooded forest, compared with 362,000 ha in 1991, 614,000 ha in the 1960s, and more than 1 million ha \noriginally. \n ", "2   \nThere is a disproportionately high level of female heads of households who are particularly \ndisadvantaged.  \n \n5.  Health  shocks  and  chronic  illness  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  are  major  causes  of \nimpoverishment, more so than elsewhere in Cambodia. Here the cycle of poverty, ill health, and \nhigh health-care expenditure by households (11% of household income) cripples families.5 \nSince people frequently rely on pond water for drinking, children suffer from repeated attacks of \ndiarrhea. Malaria, dengue fever, acute respiratory infections, and tuberculosis are endemic, and \nthe rate of HIV/AIDS6 infection is the highest in the region. Other shocks result from natural \ndisasters, particularly floods and droughts, fires, crop pests and diseases, and livestock losses. \nAbout 45% of people borrow to cover the cost of such shocks, often removing children from \nschools, starting with girls, and ultimately by selling the few possessions they have, including \nhouses and land. Almost 30% of household income is used to overcome shocks of various \ncauses.7 \n \n6.  Government's  Response.  The  Government  has  introduced  basin-level  strategic \nplanning to coordinate conservation actions and the strengthening of its management capacity \nin a comprehensive and systematic manner. In support of this effort, ADB developed the Tonle \nSap basin strategy8 to promote (i) pro-poor, sustainable economic growth; (ii) equitable access \nto  assets;  and  (iii)  improved  management  of  natural  resources  and  the  environment.  The \nstrategy reflects ADB's basinwide approach to natural resources management and sets out a \nprogram of activities that ADB, together with other agencies, expects to pursue over a 10-year \nhorizon.9 The first loan under the strategy is the TSEMP, which is assisting the Government to \nimplement sustainable management and conservation of natural resources and biodiversity in \nthe Tonle Sap basin. The TSEMP has initiated a program of subsequent TAs and projects that \nwill address generic conservation concerns and improve social and environmental conditions.  \n \n7.  The Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods Project being processed for consideration in \nDecember 2005, responds to the Government's Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, \nEquity, and Efficiency and will support its ongoing decentralization and deconcentration program. \nThe Livelihoods Project will finance livelihood-enhancing activities, selected as an outcome of \ncommunity-driven development processes, in communes located either fully or partly in the \nbuffer zone and core areas of the TSBR.10  \n \n8.  Rationale for Lowland Stabilization. The lowland areas of the Tonle Sap basin are the \nflat, low-lying areas that extend beyond the buffer zone to the foothills of the upper watershed. \nAlthough there is no precise boundary between the lowland and the buffer zone, livelihood \nactivities in lowland areas are based predominantly on a single, wet season rice crop,11 whereas \nthose in the buffer zone are more closely linked to fishing and related activities (e.g., fish \nprocessing, boat building, employment in fishing lots) and the harvesting of nontimber forest \n                                                 \n5  Half of the children under the age of 5 in the Tonle Sap basin are malnourished and, for every 1,000 live births, 115 \nchildren die before they reach the age of 5. \n6  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n7  Helmers, K., J. Gibson, and P. Wallgren. 2003. Rural Sources of Income and Livelihood Strategies Study, Final \nReport. Washington DC. \n8  ADB. 2005. The Tonle Sap Basin Strategy. Manila.  \n9  ADB. Various years. Future Solutions Now: The Tonle Sap Initiative. Manila. \n10  The zoning corresponds to UNESCO\u2019s criteria wherein core areas are securely protected sites; buffer zones \nsurround or adjoin the core areas and allow for a limited range of activities that are compatible with sound \necological practices; and in the transition zone the existing inhabitants may engage in a variety of economic and \nother activities provided these do not impact negatively on the core areas and buffer zone.  \n11 Including areas where flood recession and floating rice farming systems are practiced. \n ", "  3\nproducts (NTFP) from the flooded forest. The lowland areas are characterized by soils of low \nfertility, a climate of pronounced wet and dry seasons with drought conditions12 persisting for \nlong  periods  each  year  (November  to  April), and  few  income-earning  activities or  off-farm \nemployment  opportunities.  Functioning  irrigation  systems13 capable  of  assuring  year-round \nsupplies are few, hence less than 20% of the cropped area is irrigated and yields are low by \nregional standards (2 tons per hectare [ha] on average). Landholdings are small and decreasing \ndue to population growth (cultivable land in Cambodia fell from 0.29 ha per capita in 1990 to \n0.21 ha in 1999).14 In addition, there is a serious lack of basic infrastructure. Many communities \nare poorly served by roads, and domestic water supplies and sanitation are almost nonexistent.  \n \n9.  The extensive participatory rural appraisal (PRA) done under the preparatory TA for the \nLivelihoods Project15 in 2004 showed that food insecurity (essentially rice deficit) is perennial for \nlandless and land-poor households in the lowland areas, and that their basic survival recourse is \n(i) harvesting of fish, animals, reptiles, fuelwood, building materials, and NTFP from the flooded \nforest; and (ii) conversion of flooded forest to rice farmland. This response, which severely \nimpairs the regenerative capacity of the TSBR, is also a source of conflict between lowland and \nbuffer zone populations. Appendix 1 has a summary of the PRA findings. \n \n10.  The PRA showed that lowland households are unanimous in wishing to have new and \nrehabilitated  irrigation  and  water  management  schemes  to  extend  their  rice  cropping \nopportunities. With water conservation and control infrastructure, many of them would be able to \ngrow a second rice crop. In common with inhabitants of the buffer zone, they are also in dire \nneed of basic infrastructure for water supply, sanitation, and social services; and assistance with \ndeveloping alternative livelihood opportunities, particularly off-farm income-earning activities.  \n \n11.  The envisaged Tonle Sap Lowland Stabilization Project will complement and use the \nsame implementation arrangements and modalities as the Livelihoods Project so that each \nproject  will  fit  seamlessly  into  the  Government's  decentralization  and  deconcentration \nprograms.16 It  will  relieve  pressure  on  the  natural  resources  of  the  Tonle  Sap  through \nimprovement of existing and development of new livelihood activities in the lowlands, thereby \nreducing the incentives for dryland farming communities to extract natural resources from the \nTSBR, particularly during the \u201chungry months\u201d of the dry season when alternative livelihood \nactivities are few.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural \nresources  and  biodiversity  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin.  Its  outcome  is  an  increased  range  of \nenvironmentally  sound,  sustainable  livelihood  activities  developed  in  consultation  with  the \n                                                 \n12  Droughts cause greater hardship in the areas surrounding the Tonle Sap than do floods. Rainfall in the lake\u2019s basin \nis only 1,300\u20131,500 millimeters (mm) annually while potential evapotranspiration is of the order of 1,500 mm. \n13 Some 180 irrigation and water control schemes in varying states of functioning exist in the project area. They vary \nin size from 10 ha up to 13,000 ha, but most are small. Many were built during the Khmer Rouge regime and \nfunctioned for a few years only.  \n14 Finnish Environment Institute Consultancy Consortium. 2003. Where Do You Go?

The project area comprises five provinces \n(plus two districts of Banteay Meanchey) that adjoin the Tonle Sap\u2014Battambang, Kompong \nChhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. The project preparatory TA will prepare an \nagreed-upon design for the Project, with reference to the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 2) and summary initial poverty and social analysis (Appendix 3).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  Project  will  provide  a  commune-operated  livelihood  fund  to  finance  selected \nsubprojects to improve livelihood outcomes. Under the TA, subprojects will be selected by \nparticipating communes according to agreed-upon criteria and prepared to feasibility level. \nApproved subprojects will be subjected to detailed design during the Project. Given that the \nsubprojects adjoin the TSBR and could, through hydraulic connectivity, have negative impacts \non ecologically sensitive areas, the Project is classified as environmental category A. The TA \nwill use the livelihoods approach (Appendix 1) to identify the most appropriate activities.  \n \n14.  The specific TA components in preparing the project are (i) a survey of the livelihood and \nmarket linkages of the households in the target areas to determine sources, amount, and nature \nof income; labor utilization and availability; and seasonality of employment opportunities and \nincome; (ii) community mobilization to identify and prioritize suitable small-scale infrastructure \nneeds, with emphasis on irrigation and related water conservation works;17 and (iii) feasibility-\nlevel design of selected subprojects together with other subcomponents and activities to support \ntheir implementation and successful uptake under the ensuing project.18  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,180,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange of $702,050 and local currency cost equivalent of $477,950. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1,000,000 equivalent, including the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$297,950 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, in an amount equivalent to $800,000, \nand by ADB's TA funding program in an amount equivalent to $200,000. The Government will \nfinance the remaining local currency cost, equivalent to $180,000, largely through the provision \nof office accommodation and transport, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, surveys \nand investigations, and administrative support. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 4. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA is expected to commence in April 2006 and to be completed by December 2006. \nA team of international consultants associated with domestic consultants will implement the TA \nover 9 months. Implementation will require an estimated 32 person-months international and 37 \nperson-months  domestic  services  with  core  expertise  in  rural  development,  community \n                                                 \n17 These may include water storage structures (including earth dams, flood retention embankments, and small weirs \nand diversion structures in rivers), irrigation canals and related control structures, pumps, community wells and \nponds, rural access roads and foot bridges. \n18 Including improvement of local extension services for water distribution, participatory irrigation management, crop \ndiversification, livestock, forestry, and tree crops. Where appropriate and practicable the project would support \ndevelopment of off-farm income generating activities, and develop livelihood skills through training (e.g., in credit \nutilization) and research on market availability and price information. \n ", "  5\ndevelopment, participatory rural appraisal, ethnic minority issues, gender, design of small-scale \nhydraulic and other structures, water resources management, agronomy and agro-ecosystem \nanalysis, environmental assessment, financial analysis, and project economics. Unallocated \nexpertise may relate to agricultural extension, health care, and small business development. \nThe consultants will be recruited through a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method and full technical proposals. \nThe rural development specialist will lead the team. The consultants will be based in Phnom \nPenh and will travel frequently to the project area. Equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 5. \n \n17.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and \nMeteorology (MOWRAM). MOWRAM is responsible for the policy and regulatory framework for \nwater resources development in general and for implementing and managing small, medium-\nscale, and large hydraulic works. Through such projects as the Northwest Irrigation Sector \nProject19 and the TA for Community Self-Reliance and Flood Risk Reduction,20 MOWRAM has \ngained considerable experience in community-based participatory approaches. MOWRAM will \nassign experienced staff to serve full-time as counterparts to the consultants. To ensure the \nclose  involvement  of  relevant  agencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and \nFisheries; Ministry of Rural Development; and Ministry of Interior; a steering committee chaired \nby the Ministry of Economy and Finance will be established. Tripartite meetings will be held at \nregular intervals during implementation. MOWRAM\u2019s provincial departments of water resources \nand  meteorology  will  be  responsible  for  interagency  coordination  at  the  provincial  level, \nincluding nomination of technical personnel to assist the consultants in the target provinces. To \nfacilitate  implementation,  MOWRAM  will  provide  logistical  support,  including  adequately \nfurnished office space and access to communications facilities.  \n \n18.  The consultants will produce (i) an inception report, (ii) a midterm report, (iii) a draft final \nreport (including resettlement plans for each subproject as an appendix), and (iv) a final report \n(in  a  form  suitable  for  publication  as  an  ADB  document).  MOWRAM  will  complete  a  TA \ncompletion questionnaire to evaluate the TA's inputs and outputs, identify lessons learned, and \nsuggest follow-up actions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Cambodia for preparing the Tonle Sap Lowland Stabilization Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2003.

The preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods \nProject\u2014under processing for consideration in December 2005\u2014included participatory rural \nappraisal  (PRA)  of  the  potential  beneficiaries  located  in  the  area  lying  between  national \nhighways No. 5 and No. 6 in the provinces of Kompong Thom, Siem Reap, Battambang, Pursat, \nand Kompong Chhnang. In designing the PRA, the TA consultants accounted for the different \nzones of the Tonle Sap biosphere reserve (TSBR): core areas (CA), buffer zone (BZ), and \ntransition zone (TZ). The results of the PRA have been analyzed and reported accordingly.  \n \n2.  The PRA was specifically designed to support a sustainable livelihood approach, and the \nprocess was reinforced and confirmed through stakeholder workshops in each province, and \nthrough a national workshop in Phnom Penh. The PRA was conducted in 67 villages around the \nTonle Sap. Of the total 67 villages surveyed, 33 are located in the TZ and will be covered under \nthe present TA for preparing the Tonle Sap lowland stabilization project.  \n \nB.  The Sustainable Livelihood Approach  \n3.  The sustainable livelihood approach is based on an understanding of the nature and \ninteraction of five key livelihood components: \n(i)  Livelihood assets\u2014the strengths that people have available to achieve their \nlivelihood goals. \n(ii)  Transforming  structures  and  processes  (often  referred  to  as  policies, \ninstitutions, and processes)\u2014the enabling environment for livelihood activities. \n(iii)  Livelihood  strategies\u2014the  range  and  combination  of  activities  and  choices \nadopted to achieve livelihood goals. \n(iv)  Livelihood outcomes\u2014the achievements or outputs of livelihood strategies. \n(v)  Vulnerability context\u2014the factors operating in the external environment, which \nmay affect people's susceptibility to poverty. \n \n4.  The  sustainable  livelihood  approach  considers  assets  in  terms  of  human,  social, \nfinancial, physical, and natural capital. In the Tonle Sap region, most livelihoods are based on \naccess to natural capital, either through agriculture or through exploitation of renewable natural \nresources. The interaction between the various forms of capital, their relative strengths and \nweaknesses, and the diverse externalities determine the options for, and success of, livelihood \nstrategies. \n \nC.

People's priorities \nfor asset accumulation vary according to the specific circumstances of the particular village. \nEnhancement of natural assets is a priority in all zones, but communities in the TZ focus on \naccess to land and water for agriculture, whereas in the BZ and CA the key concern was for \nsustainable production from fisheries, both from more effective participatory management and \nfrom  aquaculture  development.  The  BZ/CA  communities  have  a  strong  interest  in  land \ndevelopment  and  irrigation  systems  for  agriculture,  due  perhaps  to  poor  performance  of \nfisheries in 2004, and are concerned about a general decline in production over which they felt \nthey had no control. \n \n ", "8    Appendix 1 \na.  Natural Capital \n7.  The core elements of the natural asset base were (i) fish and other aquatic resources, \n(ii) timber and nontimber forest products (NTFP), (iii) water, (iv) land, and (v) livestock. \n \n8.  Fisheries. Actual production estimates may vary widely, but the value of the Tonle Sap \nfishery is well documented. The importance of fish to the livelihood of people living in the CAs \nand BZ was clearly stated, as was the seasonal relevance of fishing to the livelihood strategies \nof many people living in the TZ. Fish provide self-employment, wage employment (for men and \nwomen in the fishing lots), direct nutrition, indirect nutrition, and other livelihood needs (by cash \nsale or barter for other produce). \n \n9.  Timber and NTFP. In the flooded forest areas, many people, notably women, place \ngreat emphasis on their traditional access to timber and NTFP. A wide range of products from \nmedicinal  plants,  fruits  and  firewood,  to  amphibians  and  reptiles,  play  a  part  in  livelihood \nstrategies, and access to these assets is of major importance, particularly to people without \naccess to land for agriculture. \n \n10.  Water. Water is the core asset underpinning livelihood activities around the Tonle Sap \nand is highly valued by all villagers, irrespective of zone. It provides for agriculture (dry season, \nwet season, and recession cropping), fisheries production, and domestic use. \n \n11.  Land. The importance of land varied according to agro-ecological zone and livelihood \nstrategies. However, land suitable for agriculture was a highly prized asset of interest to people \nin all parts of the project area, including the CAs. All land suitable for agriculture within the \nproject area tends to be occupied and fully utilized. \n \n12.  Livestock. Livestock occupies an important place in the livelihood ambitions of many \npeople from all zones of the Tonle Sap. Livestock is regarded as both a source of income and a \nlivelihood safety net to be sold in response to shocks such as illness or expenses associated \nwith marriage or death. \n \nb.  Human Capital \n13.  Human capital includes the skills, knowledge, ability to work, and good health that \nenable a person to pursue sustainable livelihood activities. As was clear from the analysis of \nnatural assets, human capital underpins the use of all other forms of capital. There is in local \ncommunities  a  substantial  body  of  knowledge,  ranging  from  the  development  and  use  of \nindigenous fishing gear in the water bodies of the Tonle Sap to a detailed knowledge of the \npractical uses of timber and NTFP from the flooded forest and a highly developed tradition of \nwet season and flood recession agricultural cropping. Nevertheless, villagers claimed that they \nstill had the necessary skills and knowledge to develop their livelihood without dependence on \nexternal guidance, and that there are still plenty of \u201cgood people\u201d in communities to guide and \nsupport the development process. There was, however, acceptance that it was necessary to \nlearn new skills on which to base improved livelihood activities in the face of changing times, \nwhether these skills were farm- or fishery-based, or off-farm. \n \nc.  Social Capital \n14.  Social capital comprises the networks and relationships that exist between communities \nand groups, and which people make use of in their livelihood whether informal or formal. Many \n ", "Appendix 1       9 \ndifferent patronage arrangements exist within the communities. Community-based organizations \nare included as social capital. In theory, the village development committees (VDCs) should be \nthe focal point for coordinating village development, and provide a source of information and \nadvice for people seeking to resolve livelihood issues. The VDCs should also provide the \nconduit for exchange of information between the village and the Commune Council (which might \nhave seven or more villages to support). In reality, the role and success of the VDC varies \nwidely depending on how it was set up, the training it was given, and the actual role and \nfunctions it performs. \n \n15.  The community fisheries and community forestry organizations are further examples of \nimportant  community-based  organizations  that  are  a  source  of  social  capital.  They  have \ngenerated a degree of cohesion and a sense of purpose among groups of villagers. However, \ntheir  effectiveness  is  currently  constrained  by  operational  problems  and  there  have  been \nsuggestions that the organizations are not sufficiently inclusive or representative of the wider \ncommunity. The lack of strong VDCs as a village-wide integrating force is probably a major \ncontributing factor. \n \n16.  The overall message derived from the PRA was that communities feel that they still have \na substantial level of social capital, but that they lack the financial and group management skills \nnecessary for the kind of self-help approach they favor for improvement of livelihood activities. \n \nd.  Financial Capital \n17.  Financial capital is one of the essential resources that people use to achieve livelihood \nstrategies. It includes cash and savings, access to credit, and the ability to convert other assets \n(e.g., boat, motor, cattle, jewelry) into cash. It also embraces remittances sent home by family \nmembers working elsewhere. Financial capital is highly versatile and it can be converted into \nother assets, or used directly for livelihood outcomes. \n \n18.  Access to credit was high on the list of priorities expressed. The requirement was for \nmany purposes, for example, money to invest in livestock, improved rice seed, fertilizers, pest \ncontrol, fishing gear, and aquaculture. However, the demand does not imply that credit is not \navailable. The Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies (ACLEDA) is \nthe main formal provider of finance in the Tonle Sap, and makes credit available at rates \nbetween 3% and 4% per month, depending on the type of loan. Nongovernment organizations \nprovide credit at around 3% per month, small traders and village moneylenders may offer loans \n(at up to 30%), or credit may be offered against payment in kind (e.g., fish or fish products). \nMoney is clearly available as loans. However, ACLEDA requires collateral (which excludes the \npoor) and has strong rules and responses to nonpayment (which scares everybody except the \nfinancially secure). \n \ne.  Physical Capital \n19.  Physical capital is the infrastructure and the tools used to support livelihood strategies. \nThe capital varies according to strategy, e.g., households may require boats, gear, landing sites, \ndrying pads, irrigation systems, plows, or holding facilities for livestock. Some elements of \nphysical capital, such as roads, schools, housing, water supply systems, health clinics, and \nmarkets are vital to all livelihood activities. Although rural infrastructure generally tends to be \nless than adequate for livelihood needs throughout the project area, there are, nevertheless, \nsubstantial physical assets. \n \n ", "10   Appendix 1 \n2.  The Vulnerability Context \n20.  The strengths of communities, in terms of their livelihood assets, are inevitably affected \nby their vulnerability. There are three broad areas contributing to the vulnerability of poor \npeople: trends, shocks, and seasonality.  \n \n21.  Trends. Core trends include (i) declining fish resources, reflected in decreased catches \nper household; (ii) decreasing flooded forest area and decreasing forest products, notably \nwildlife; (iii) increasing human population relying on common property resources; (iv) increasing \nneed for land by TZ dwellers, notably the poor; (v) increasing demand for Tonle Sap fish \nproducts on foreign markets; and (vi) declining water quality and water levels. \n \n22.  Shocks. The main shocks facing PRA participants are (i) sudden illness of a family \nmember or wage earner, (ii) sudden drop in the availability of fish, (iii) outbreaks of disease \namong livestock (e.g., Newcastle disease in fowl), (iv) natural disasters, (v) conflict between \nresource users, and (vi) economic shocks. \n \n23.  Seasonality. Seasonality issues include (i) seasonal food security, (ii) seasonal health \nissues, and (iii) seasonal wage labor opportunities. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Sources/Monitoring  Assumptions and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nSustainable  Rate of natural resources extraction  Government's annual  \u2022 The Government maintains \nmanagement and  reduced from preproject levels  fish production  its commitment to \nrecords and flooded \nconservation of natural  biosphere reserve zoning \nforest monitoring \nresources and  principles. \nsurveys \nbiodiversity in the Tonle \n  Risk \nSap basin  \n\u2022 Enforcement of laws and \nsubdecrees is weak. \nOutcome for technical      Assumptions \nassistance (TA)     \n \nAgreed-upon design of the  Feasibility-level design of a range of  Approved feasibility  \u2022 Government continues to \nresulting project   environmentally sound, sustainable  study report for  promote the \nlivelihood activities selected by  selected subprojects  decentralization and \naffected communities in the target  democratization processes. \nResults of the \ncommunes, including \nparticipatory rural  \u2022 Government provides \n-  water conservation and small-\nappraisal (PRA)  counterpart support. \nscale irrigation infrastructure; \nsurveys \n-  other small-scale infrastructure  Risk \nand natural hazard risk  Resettlement plan \n\u2022 Powerful interests continue \nreduction measures;  (RP) for each \nland grabbing or resource \n-  improvements in extension for  subproject and \nmonopolization.  \nagriculture, forestry, crop  resettlement \ndiversification, participatory  framework (RF) for \nirrigation management, and  future subprojects. \nlivestock (including  The RF need only be \naquaculture);  prepared if the \n-  nonfarm income-generating  adopted lending \nactivities; and  modality allows for \n-  vocational training and research  identification of \nadditional subprojects \nduring project \nimplementation. \nEnvironmental impact \nassessment (EIA) \nreport \nOutputs for TA      Assumption \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in Cambodia:  \n \nCambodia ranks 130th out of 173 nations in the Human Development Report (2002); about 36% of the \npopulation live below the poverty line. About 35\u201340% of the population have expenditure levels below the \nincome poverty line of $0.46\u20130.63 per capita per day. Rural poverty is much higher than urban poverty\u2014 \nfrom a low of 10\u201315% in Phnom Penh to 40\u201345% in rural areas and reaching 70\u201380% in some areas \naround the Tonle Sap basin. In the project area of the Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods Project (under \npreparation), households headed by females (approximately 11-30% of all households) are particularly \nvulnerable to poverty because of their lack of male labor. Participation rates of children in education are \nwell below the national average, and adult literacy is low. Despite the strong national economic growth \nsince 1990, agricultural productivity in the project area has not kept pace with population growth. Fishing \nand foraging on common property such as lakes and forests supplement the food supply. However, \naccess to natural resources is becoming more difficult. The poor experience a high degree of food \ninsecurity; increasing landlessness; conflicts related to their reduced access to land, forest, and fishery \nresources; and increasing indebtedness; and cannot afford even basic health services. A significant \nnumber of people are chronically vulnerable, moving in and out of poverty as external factors affect their \nlives.  \n \nLinkage with National Poverty Reduction Strategy: \nTonle Sap supports one of the richest fisheries in the world. The lake meets directly and indirectly the \nlivelihood needs of at least 15% of Cambodia\u2019s total population and the nutrition-related needs of about \n80%, especially the poor. Because of the richness of its resources, Tonle Sap is a site of growing conflict. \nPopulation pressure, inequitable access to resources, severe poverty, and ethnic discrimination place the \nTonle Sap and the people it supports at great vulnerability. The Government recognizes the need to \nmanage the Tonle Sap in an environmentally sound and sustainable way. Through the poverty partnership \nagreement (PPA), the Government of Cambodia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified the \nTonle Sap as the geographical focus for ADB\u2019s poverty reduction efforts in Cambodia. The Tonle Sap \nstrategy sets out a plan for ADB\u2019s partnering with government institutions, nongovernment organizations, \nand communities for managing and conserving the resources of the Tonle Sap basin to support pro-poor \neconomic growth, access to assets, and management of natural resources and the environment.  \n \nLinkage with ADB\u2019s CSP for Cambodia:  \nADB's overarching goal in Cambodia is poverty reduction. ADB's country strategy and program (CSP) for \n2005\u20132009 reflects the poverty reduction objectives set out in the Socio-Economic Development Plan \n(2001\u20132005), National Poverty Reduction Strategy, Rectangular Strategy, and PPA between Cambodia \nand ADB. The CSP fosters broad-based economic growth, improved livelihood activities and reduced \nvulnerability, and improved governance at all levels. Achieving the medium-term goals of the PPA requires \nconcerted action to overcome key problems affecting sustainable management of natural resources, and \nfocusing on the Tonle Sap basin helps to maximize the development impact of ADB's assistance.  \n \nThe Tonle Sap Lowland Stabilization Project will be implemented in five provinces (plus two districts of \nBanteay Meanchey) that adjoin the Tonle Sap: Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, \nand Siem Reap. The most vulnerable people living in lowland areas will be targeted. The project will \ncontribute to poverty reduction by increasing the range of environmentally sound, sustainable livelihood \nactivities, and by building the capacity for community-based natural resource management in the lowlands \n(including the transition area and low-lying land extending beyond national highways No. 5 and No. 6) of \nthe Tonle Sap. \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will include a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) to \ndetermine  the  importance  of  natural  resources  extracted  from  the  Tonle  Sap  biosphere  reserve  to \nhousehold incomes in the transition zone. In terms of poverty analysis the project will build on existing \nstudies done for the Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods Project (under preparation) and the Northwest \nIrrigation Sector Project.1 It will also draw on the ongoing Tonle Sap Participatory Poverty Assessment \nwhich is developing a microlevel perspective of poor people\u2019s experiences with and responses to poverty. \nThe experience and knowledge gained from these will help the TA develop sustainable poverty reduction \nstrategies that are based on an understanding of what the poor really need. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \nDuring the TA, a stakeholder analysis will be undertaken in each province to determine key stakeholders \nand their roles, interests, and priorities. It will be important to assess the capacity of different stakeholders, \nparticularly the commune councils, village development committees, and target beneficiaries, to participate \nin the design, implementation, and operation and maintenance of completed works. Specific attention will \nbe given to the needs and priorities of women and the landless poor to identify any capacity-building and \ntraining needs that would facilitate their participation in the project. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \nActive community participation is critical for small-scale rural infrastructure that has a direct impact on \ncommunity well-being and livelihood. It will be strongly promoted under the project to build ownership and \nsupport the sustainable operation of project-financed infrastructure. Capacity building required to facilitate \nparticipation will be identified. Project preparation will include an assessment of other community-based \nrural infrastructure projects so that the most practicable approaches to community participation can be \nselected and incorporated. The TA will identify any special provisions needed to enable full participation of \ndisadvantaged groups and women at all stages of the project cycle.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \nFemale roles in the Tonle Sap are clearly defined. Women assume overall responsibility for managing the \nday-to-day activities of the household such as preparing food, washing clothes, collecting water, and \nproviding care for young children, the sick, and the aged. Women are also expected to contribute to most \nother livelihood activities, whether it is fishing, agriculture, or forestry related. Successive natural disasters \n(flood, drought and fire) cause severe shocks that families find difficult to cope with. Out of sheer \nnecessity, coping strategies often encompass harmful practices such as the use of illegal fishing gear, \nclearing of trees and vegetation for fuelwood (a salable item) and other products, and conversion of \nflooded forest areas to rice farms. More than 50% of the targeted population\u2014reaching over 70% in \ntransition zone villages\u2014experience some days on which they do not have enough food to eat. Debts \nincurred as a result of natural disasters, human health shocks, crop failure, and livestock losses, compel \nfamilies to seek money from whatever sources are available. Migration in search of employment in the \ngarment industry in Phnom Penh and illegal work across the border in Thailand are parts of the coping \nstrategy. Poor living conditions increase threats to women\u2019s health and economic insecurity, and create \nsevere hardships for women and girls, who may have to drop out of school and work for other families, \nsometimes in areas remote from their families, to help repay debts. \n \nThe project activities will have significant gender dimensions. Gender inequality, food security, and poverty \nare closely linked. Small-scale community infrastructure such as small irrigation pumps, community wells, \nand ponds for safe water supply, etc., will enable women to allocate more of their time for productive \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.

The selection of appropriate alternative livelihood initiatives will increase women\u2019s income, \nreduce the burdensome workload of women, decrease the opportunity costs of keeping girls in school, and \nempower women as agents and as beneficiaries of the project. Alternative income sources will be actively \npromoted under the project through participatory consultation (beginning during the TA) and inclusion of \nwomen in decision-making bodies set up to plan, implement, and operate project-financed works. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n \n1.  The project area for the proposed Tonle Sap Lowland Stabilization Project (comprises \nfive provinces (plus two districts of Banteay Meanchey) that adjoin the Tonle Sap\u2014Battambang, \nKompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. Within the project area, the \ntechnical assistance (TA) activities will concentrate on lowland areas abutting the buffer zone \n(BZ) of the Tonle Sap biosphere reserve (TSBR), specifically those parts of the lowland from \nwhich people migrate into the TSBR at certain times of the year to extract natural resources, \nclear land for and engage in agriculture, or seek employment in fishing lots or other economic \nactivities. \n \n2.  The TA will prepare a project to be executed by the Ministry of Water Resources and \nMeteorology (MOWRAM). MOWRAM will appoint a project director to (i) provide day-to-day \nguidance to the TA consultants; (ii) liaise with the provincial rural development committees \n(PRDCs)1 and other relevant Government agencies in the target provinces; and (iii) assist the \nconsultants to implement the TA efficiently and effectively. The TA consultants will liaise closely \nwith  the  Cambodia  National  Mekong  Committee  (CNMC)  and  the  National  Committee  for \nDisaster Management (NCDM) to obtain and share relevant data. They will be based in Phnom \nPenh and implement the TA over 9 months. \n \nB.  Basic Approach \n \n3.  The TA will draw from and build on the extensive social and livelihood surveys and other \nstudies carried out under the project preparatory TA for the proposed Tonle Sap Sustainable \nLivelihoods  Project, 2  and  will  reflect  closely  the  participatory  approaches,  financing \narrangements, and other mechanisms developed for the ensuing project.3  \n \n4.  The  TA  will  also  incorporate  tested  approaches,  including  labor-based  appropriate \ntechnologies  (LBAT)  developed  by  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),4 and  the \napproach pioneered by CONCERN Cambodia in its Community-Led Livelihood Improvement \nProject (Cli Project)5 currently under implementation in Pursat and Siem Reap provinces. At the \ninstitutional level, the TA will explore effective mechanisms that focus on the local government \nand  empower  local  people,  such as  those  defined  under  the  Government's  ongoing  Seila \nprogram.6  \n                                                 \n1  The PRDC represents the primary governance and development forum at the subnational level for disseminating \npolicy and coordinating overall provincial planning and development. The PRDC is chaired by the governor and \nincludes  senior  representatives  of  the  provincial  departments  of  water  resources  and  meteorology;  rural \ndevelopment;  agriculture,  forestry  and  fisheries;  women\u2019s  affairs;  land  management,  urban  planning  and \nconstruction; finance; local administration; and environment, among others. \n2  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Preparing  the  Tonle  Sap  Sustainable \nLivelihoods Project. Manila.   \n3  It is expected that the loan for the proposed Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods Project will be approved in 2005. \n4  ILO  has  promoted  LBAT  in  Cambodia  since  1992  to  generate  employment  through  the  improvement  and \nmaintenance of essential rural infrastructure. The LBAT approach is a highly effective means of reducing poverty. \n5  The Cli Project aims to increase the capacity of communities to identify their development needs and rights, \nmobilize resources, and take action to bring about a sustainable improvement in livelihood security.  \n6  Seila is the name given to the 10-year-old trial approach to decentralized development planning, financing, and \nimplementation. The Seila program's support structures were rolled out to all provinces following the election of \ncommune councils in 2002. The Seila program will wind down by the end of 2006. Its support structures are being \nintegrated into those proposed in the Government's strategic framework for decentralization and deconcentration \nover a transition period of about 5 years. \n ", "  Appendix 5  19 \n \n5.  The ensuing project will respond to the need for greater accountability in providing \nassistance to individuals and communities, and will adhere to the humanitarian accountability \nprinciples  being  introduced  in  Cambodia. 7  Consistent  with  the  agreements  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has reached with the Government, the project will also reflect the \nParis  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness 8  in  terms  of  harmonization  and  using  common \nprocedures among aid-assisted programs. \n \nC.  Initial Activities \n \n6.  The consultants will make site visits and compile relevant available data, including an \ninventory of ongoing projects of a similar nature,9 and will draw from them the most practicable \nmeans of ensuring participation. They will establish arrangements for sharing information with \nany ongoing projects that impact on or are active in the target provinces. They will undertake a \nstakeholder analysis to determine key stakeholders and their roles, interests, and priorities \n(particularly  commune  councils,  village  development  committees,  and  target  beneficiaries). \nDuring the site visits, a representative sample of potential beneficiaries will be interviewed to \nhelp  design  the  participatory  rural  appraisal  (PRA,  paras.  7\u201310).  The  initial  activities  will \nculminate  in  the  preparation  of  an  inception  report  describing  preliminary  findings  and \npresenting recommendations for any revisions considered necessary in the terms of reference. \nA tripartite meeting will be held to review the inception report. \n \nD.  Component 1: Livelihood Survey in Tonle Sap Lowland Area \n \n7.  Participatory Rural Appraisal. The consultants will design a PRA\u2014to be conducted in \nsample target areas over 3 months\u2014to determine the main sources of income of households in \nthe Tonle Sap lowlands, specifically in areas from which people move into the TSBR to seek \nemployment or extract natural resources. The PRA will be carried out under the consultants\u2019 \nsupervision  by  locally  recruited  domestic  consultants  or  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs).10 The results of the PRA will be presented using base maps derived from the aerial \nphotographs and orthophotomaps prepared under the Tonle Sap Environmental Management \nProject (TSEMP),11 or other suitable media. The results will be made available in Khmer to all \nparticipating villages.  \n \n8.  The PRA will determine the income structure for different households at different times \nof the year: the activities they engage in and where these take place; which members of the \nhousehold participate; the nature and quantity of resources extracted from the TSBR; and how \nimportant these are to the household's total income. The temporal and spatial linkages will be \nexamined to help determine the times of year when it is most critical to provide alternative \nincome-earning activities in lowland areas. Participating households will help select the most \n                                                 \n7 The humanitarian accountability principles are (i) commitment to humanitarian standards and rights; (ii) informing \nright-bearers  about  the  program,  standards,  principles,  and  mechanisms  to  be  used;  (iii)  right-bearers'  full \nparticipation in the program; (iv) providing mechanisms for addressing complaints; and (v) partners' commitment to \nimplementing these principles. \n8  High Level Forum. 2005. Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Paris. \n9  A partial list of such projects is available in Supplementary Appendix A (Rural Development Projects in the Tonle \nSap Basin). \n10 Reference will be made to the selection criteria developed for Community Based Livelihood Enhancement for the \nRural Poor (ADB. 2002. Proposed Grant Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Community Based Livelihood \nEnhancement for the Rural Poor. Manila). \n11  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project. Manila. \n ", "20  Appendix 5 \n \nappropriate range of investment subprojects (including infrastructure and support for alternative \nlivelihood and income-earning activities) to be financed under the ensuing project. The PRA will \nexamine the potential role of agriculture (including rice-fish farming systems) and livestock, and \nthe relative importance of providing water conservation and small-scale irrigation facilities to \nenable dry season cropping and diversified cropping.12 The PRA will also cover households in \nthe BZ and core areas to determine the nature of any conflicts that occur in resource access \nand use, and to help formulate means of reducing any such conflicts.  \n \n9.  Ethnic Minority Issues. All data from the PRA will be disaggregated for ethnicity to \ndetermine the significance of ethnic minority factors, such as discrimination, that inhibit access \nto livelihood resources or participation in decision-making bodies. The needs, priorities, and \nconstraints  of  ethnic  minority  communities,  particularly  the  Cham  (Khmer  Islam)  and \nVietnamese13 communities, will be examined. The consultants will prepare an ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan, if necessary, in accordance with ADB's policy on indigenous peoples14 and \nsocial protection strategy.  \n \n10.  Gender  Action  Plan.  Data  from  the  PRA  will  also  be  gender-disaggregated  to \ndetermine the special needs of female heads of households and women. The consultants will \nprepare a gender action plan, in accordance with ADB's policy on gender and development,15 to \nenhance women\u2019s participation and set out specific actions to improve their livelihood choices. \n \nE.  Component 2: Selection of Subprojects \n11.  Based on the nature and likely scope of the preferred investment subprojects, and the \nTA consultant\u2019s analysis of sector institutions and MOWRAM's sector development strategy, \nMOWRAM and ADB will decide on the appropriate lending modality for the ensuing project and \nselect  target  communes  in  consultation  with  the  PRDCs.  The  target  communes  should \nrepresent  a  range  of  socioeconomic  and  geographical  conditions  and  incorporate  a  large \npercentage  of  poor  beneficiaries  (para.  18).  The  selection  will  also  take  into  account  the \nhydrological potential of the subbasins; MOWRAM\u2019s development plans for small-scale irrigation; \nexisting agriculture, livestock and fish rearing, and off-farm employment opportunities; presence \nof similar projects; and proximity to markets and other services.  \n \n12.  The consultants will conduct public meetings within the target communes to disseminate \nthe results of the PRA, and to demonstrate how the findings can be used to guide the selection \nof potential subprojects. The consultants will assist in the formation of village-level interest \n                                                 \n12 The  PRA  will  include  commune  agro-ecosystem  analysis  (CAEA)  to  identify  opportunities  for  agricultural \nimprovement that are specifically tailored to the agro-ecosystems, including consideration of the interdependent set \nof inputs, climate, techniques, ecological niche characteristics, socio-cultural behavior, and other factors. CAEA is \na participatory technique that is now used as the basic needs assessment tool for agricultural extension and \ndevelopment planning, under the direction of the Department of Agricultural Extension of the Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry and Fisheries. In particular, the consultants will establish links with the Cambodia Australia Agricultural \nExtension Project (financed by the Australian Agency for International Development) to benefit from the experience \ngained  on  this  project  and  to  ensure  that  a  compatible  and  complementary  approach  is  used  to  develop \nrecommended farming systems for the target areas. The consultants will similarly establish links with the Rural \nDevelopment Program (financed by German Technical Cooperation) and the Economic and Social Relaunch of \nNorthwest Provinces Project or ECOSORN (financed by the European Community). \n13 The Vietnamese reside mainly in floating villages and are engaged predominantly in fishing. They are not present \nin the transition zone and would only be marginally affected by the project because of their presence in the buffer \nzone. \n14 ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 5  21 \ngroups16 to  propose  and  prioritize  suitable  subprojects17 for  feasibility  study  and  possible \nfunding under the ensuing project.18 It is expected that eligible subprojects will include some or \nall of (i) rural infrastructure,19 (ii) income-generating activities, and (iii) support for capacity \nbuilding and training.20 The consultants will examine the potential for introducing in the target \ncommunes innovative solutions that are being piloted in Cambodia, such as the drinking water \npurification techniques introduced by the International Development Enterprises with financing \nfrom the Canadian International Development Agency. \n \n13.  Selection of subprojects will be made in public meetings and workshops using locally \nhired facilitators or NGOs to lead the discussions in the Khmer language. \n \nF.  Component 3: Feasibility Study of Subprojects \n14.  The consultants will prepare feasibility-level designs for the selected subprojects to a \nlevel of detail consistent with the determination of technical, economic, and financial feasibility; \nand they will formulate a project for possible funding by ADB. For most rural infrastructure, \nsimple  off-the-shelf  or  standard  designs  (available  from  MOWRAM,  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment, and their provincial agencies) will be used. In addition to investments supported \nby the community livelihood fund, the project will include as necessary (i) capacity building of \nrelevant  agencies;  (ii) livelihood  training;  (iii)  training  in  gender  awareness,  community \nmobilization, and conflict resolution; and (iv) environmental education and awareness. A project \nperformance  management  system  will  be  designed,  including  clearly  defined  targets  and \nindicators. \n \n15.  Environmental  Impact  Assessment.  The  proposed  project  activities\u2014rehabilitation \nand  construction  of  irrigation  facilities,  rural  access  roads,  small-scale  rural  water  supply \nschemes\u2014are not expected to cause significant adverse environmental impacts. However, \nbecause these activities will be implemented near or within the TSBR, the project is classified as \nenvironmental category A. The consultants will prepare a full environmental impact assessment \n(EIA)21 and an environmental management plan (EMP) for each subproject in accordance with \nthe  Government's  current  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environment  policy22 and  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (para. 18).23 \n \n16.  Resettlement.  Land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided  to  the \nextent possible. Where land adjustments are required, farmers will be encouraged through a \ncommunity-based participatory approach to donate a portion of their land to the project. The \nconsultants  will  prepare  draft  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  for  the  selected  subprojects  in \n                                                 \n16 Village-level interest groups will have not less than 40% female membership. \n17 Subprojects must be demonstrably free of negative effects on the environment and cultural heritage.  \n18 The ensuing project will use the commune fund managed by the commune councils to finance activities and \ninfrastructure, adopting the same procedures as in the Livelihoods Project. \n19 Water storage structures (including earth dams, flood retention embankments, and small weirs and diversion \nstructures in rivers); irrigation canals and related control structures; pumps; community wells and ponds; rural \naccess roads and footbridges; and facilities that lessen the work burden of women and girls.  \n20 Improvement of local extension services for agriculture and water distribution, participatory irrigation management, \ncrop diversification, livestock, forestry, tree crops, training in livelihood skills (e.g., in credit utilization), and research \non market availability and price information. \n21  Preparation of the EIA is a critical activity in the loan processing schedule and should be done at the earliest \npossible stage. A summary EIA is to be circulated to the Board of Directors of ADB for not less than 120 days prior \nto consideration of the ensuing loan by the Board.  \n22  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy.

The RPs will include participatory \nmonitoring and evaluation mechanisms. \n \n17.  Economic and Financial Analyses. The consultants will assess the economic and \nfinancial viability and the economic, financial, and fiscal sustainability of the ensuing project, in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  and  Workbook  on \nEconomic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts of Development Projects.  \n \n18.  Sector Lending Modality. If a sector lending modality is adopted for the ensuing project, \nthe selected subprojects within target communes should include not less than 20% of the total \nnumber of anticipated project beneficiaries under the project. In addition, the consultants will be \nrequired to prepare an environmental assessment review procedure (EARP)24 and resettlement \nframework (RF) for use in future subprojects.25 \n \nG.  Reporting \n \n19.  The consultants will produce (i) an inception report within 1 month of the start of the TA; \n(ii) a midterm report within 5 months, in a form suitable for publication as an ADB document; (iii) \na draft final report within 8 months; and (iv) a final report. MOWRAM will complete a TA \ncompletion questionnaire to evaluate the TA's inputs and outputs, identify lessons learned, and \nsuggest follow-up actions. \n \n20.  The inception report, to be discussed at the first tripartite meeting, will include a data \ninventory,  stakeholder  analysis,  recommended  approach  and  methodology  for  the  PRA, \nincluding representative target areas and practicable means of assuring participation, actions to \nensure complementarity with ongoing projects of a similar nature, and issues for discussion. \n \n21.  The midterm report, to be discussed at the second tripartite meeting, will present the \nresults  of  the  PRA  and  the  outcome  of  the  workshops  and  meetings  held  to  select \nrepresentative subprojects. The report will propose specific interventions and an appropriate \nlending modality. It will identify the expertise required for project design in the second phase of \nthe TA, including terms of reference for hitherto unallocated specialists. A stakeholder workshop \nwill be held 1 week before the tripartite meeting to broaden perspectives. \n \n22.  The draft final report, to be discussed at the third tripartite meeting, will present the \nsalient  features  of  the  project  proposed  for  ADB  assistance,  including  technical,  financial, \neconomic, legal, institutional, social, environmental, and other aspects. The report will also \nspecify implementation arrangements. A stakeholder workshop will be held 1 week before the \nfinal tripartite meeting to seek broad endorsement. The Government's and ADB's comments on \nthe draft final report will be incorporated into the final report. The final report will include a \ndesign and monitoring framework structured in accordance with ADB's format for the report and \nrecommendation of the President. All reports will be prepared in English and will be translated \ninto the Khmer language. \n                                                 \n24 Guidelines for an EARP can be found at:  \nhttp://adb.org/documents/Guidelines/Environmental_Assessment/Content_Format_Environmental_Assessment_ \n    Review_Procedures.pdf. \n25 A sample RF is available at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/CAM/LARF-TSS.pdf. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060113162828+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051222161014+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Final TA report _15.12.05_.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "Cbr", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \n \nCommune councils. In Cambodia, an elected body that governs commune administration. In \naddition to fulfilling their administrative tasks, commune councils participate in informal dispute \nresolution, plan and implement development projects, do some agency functions for the central \nand provincial governments, and conduct advocacy. Development activities consist mainly of \nsmall-scale infrastructure and public goods projects.  \n \nCommunity  management.  The  community-based  management  of  local  natural  resources, \nincluding certain designated fishing areas, with support from relevant authorities, and institutions \nand organizations. \n \nCore areas.
