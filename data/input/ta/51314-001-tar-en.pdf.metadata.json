THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will enhance the capacity of \ngovernment agencies in South Asia to design and implement innovative features in transport \nprojects that are scheduled for approval in 2019\u20132020 or are under implementation in 2018\u2013\n2020.1 The TA is not included in any country operations business plan (COBP). However, it will \nsupport transport projects listed in the COBP of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.2 \nKnowledge exchange among government agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \nthink tanks, and the private sector will be one of the key methods of including innovative features \nin projects. Others will involve capacity building through technical advice and training programs. \nInnovative features may include subjects related to road and rail safety, engineering design, \nresettlement and rehabilitation, environment, disaster risk management,  gender mainstreaming, \ncommunication, asset management and project finance.3 The TA facility approach is suitable as \nit will (i) provide project preparation and implementation support to a number of projects; (ii) enable \nefficient use of resources by having the same consultants or NGOs and think tanks work for a \nnumber of projects, avoiding repeated lengthy recruitment processes; and (iii) ease knowledge \nexchange and capacity building activities for a number of executing agencies  and implementing \nagencies.  \n \n2.  The TA will initially provide project preparation support to the following projects in the \npipeline: (i) BAN: Dhaka Metro Line 5 North Investment Program; (ii) BAN: Railway Rolling Stock \nMaintenance Project; (iii) IND: Indore Metro Rail Project; and (iv) SRI: Railway Investment \nProgram. For projects under implementation, capacity building and technical support will initially \nbe provided to (i) BAN: Chittagong \u2013 Cox\u2019s Bazaar Rail Project; (ii) BHU: SASEC Transport, Trade \nFacilitation and Logistics Project, and iii) NEP: SASEC Road Connectivity Improvement Project.4 \nThese  projects  involve  challenging  environmental  and  resettlement  issues  which  are \noverwhelming the implementing agency and executing agency, and could potentially cause \ndelays in project implementation.5  Hence, additional technical and capacity building support is \nnecessary. This will require additional funds exceeding the budget available for the projects. \nDetailed information for each project is provided in Appendix 1. \n                                                \n1  Innovative features are activities or new ideas that are being designed or implemented for the first time in the state \nor country or region. \n2  ADB. 2017.

The aide memoire of the respective missions documents discussions on the \nproposed scope of the TA.  \n5  The Bangladesh SASEC Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazaar Rail Project, for instance, involves the construction of a 102 km \ngreenfield rail line that passes through three protected areas and several elephant crossings. Innovative mitigation \nmeasures proposed under the project include: (i) elephant overpasses (first of its kind in the world), (ii) wildlife \nunderpasses, (iii) funnel fencing, and (iv) sensor systems to provide early warning to train drivers on presence of \nelephants near the railway line (also first of its kind in the world).  \n ", "2 \n \n3.  The Asia and the Pacific region is experiencing change in various fronts due to rapid \neconomic growth. This creates an evolving financial landscape with shifting development needs. \nThis is the key principle on which the ADB Strategy 2020 is based. Rapid economic growth brings \na host of challenges identified in Strategy 2020 such as (i) continued poverty, (ii) disparities in \nwell-being within and among developing member countries (DMCs), (iii) the growing strain on the \nnatural environment, (iv) inadequate infrastructure to deliver social services, (v) the need for better \nregional  cooperation  and  integration,  and  (vi)  the  need  for  more  emphasis  on  innovation, \ntechnology, and higher education.  \n \n4.  The existence of an evolving business environment among DMCs combined with the \nOCR-ADF  merger  has  pushed  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  to  prepare  projects  that  are \nincreasingly complex in nature and are of a larger scale.6 In the South Asia Transport and \nCommunications (SATC) division, this has translated into a significant increase in the total number \nof projects and lending volume, accounting for 44% in 2016 and 30% in 2017 of the overall ADB \ntransport sector lending. Transport sector lending in South Asia Department (SARD) comprised \n32% in 2016 and 29% in 2017.7 Between 2006 and 2015, SATC has processed an annual \naverage of six projects with a total value of $1.2 billion. In 2016, 11 projects worth $2.075 billion \nand in 2017, nine projects worth $2.034 billion were approved. This trend is expected to continue, \nwith approximately 10 projects each in the pipeline for approval in 2018 and 2019.  \n \n5.  The Bangladesh SASEC Chittagong\u2013Cox\u2019s Bazaar Railway Project, Phase 1 (SCCB) \nworth $2.2 billion, with ADB financing of $1.5 billion, was approved in 2016. This was the largest \nproject approved by ADB that year and the largest project approved in SATC in the past 10 years. \nIn the same year, the India Bihar New Ganga Bridge (BNGB) Project worth $832 million with ADB \nfinancing of $500 million was also approved. Support for such mega flagship projects are \nincreasingly  being  requested  by  ADB  DMCs.  Inevitably,  these  projects  come  with  major \nchallenges and risks, and test the capacity of all project participants including government \nimplementing agencies. Mitigating risks of flagship projects require world class engineering \ndesign,  thorough  financial  and  economic  analysis  including  investigating  private  sector \nparticipation, and innovative maintenance systems to ensure sustainability of the infrastructure. \nThe complexity of safeguard issues is immensely compounded. For example, the social and \nenvironment safeguards categories for both the SCCB and BNGB projects are A as they lead to \nsignificant impact on involuntary resettlement and involve highly sensitive environmental issues. \nMandatory climate change assessment is rapidly advancing at a global level, hence, the project \nteam and government require additional support in meeting evolving requirements during project \npreparation and implementation.8 These challenges call for engaging high quality technical \nexperts, implementing innovative ideas, and collaborating closely with executing agencies.  \n \n6.  Similar challenges arise in projects among SARD DMCs due to geographic proximity and \nsimilar  institutional  systems.  For  example,  Bhutan  and  Nepal  are  both  landlocked  and \nmountainous countries that suffer from severe road blocks due to landslides every monsoon. \nHence, similar slope protection measures and road maintenance systems could be applied. \nFlooding is common in Bangladesh, in some states in India, and the Terai region of Nepal, hence, \nrequiring similar flood and drainage management systems. SATC has been implementing  rural \nroad projects in India and Sri Lanka where similar challenges are faced on road design, road \n                                                \n6 The merger is a groundbreaking initiative of ADB to combine ordinary capital resources (OCR) and the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) approved by the ADB board in 2016. It became effective in January 2017 and is expected \nto expand ADB\u2019s lending capacity by as much as 50%.  \n7  Including cofinancing. \n8  In place since 2014. ", "3 \n \nsafety,  climate  resilience,  land  donation  and  public  consultations.  Significant  involuntary \nresettlement is being encountered for projects in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka with \nsimilar types of social risks, compensation and rehabilitation-related issues. Road safety is a \nparamount concern in all SARD DMCs where large numbers of railway and road accidents occur \nin Bangladesh and India. Many common environmental issues such as those related to wildlife \nexist across SARD DMCs. SATC is currently implementing one rail project in Bangladesh and two \nroad projects in Nepal and Bhutan with elephant routes crossing the road.9 All these projects \ninvolve innovative wildlife impact mitigation measures.  Finally, communication with external \nstakeholders remains a challenge in most transport projects. Good practices under the India \nJaipur Metro Rail Project and Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project, could be shared \nand replicated in similar projects in South Asia.10  \n \n7.  Common issues and challenges within and among the SARD DMCs bring tremendous \nopportunities for regional cooperation, collaborative learning and South-South collaboration. \nUnder the standard framework of investment projects and TAs where resource packaging is \nlargely project-focused and country-focused, it is difficult to exchange knowledge and expertise \non regional and global best practices which is often more efficient and more likely to bring \nsuccessful results. There are limited avenues for government officials to collaborate with NGOs, \nthink tanks or the private sector within and outside South Asia on topics such as road and rail \nsafety, engineering design, resettlement and rehabilitation, environment management, climate \nresilience, gender mainstreaming, asset management, and project finance.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Innovative features developed and/or implemented. The TA will support the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  innovative  features  in  at  least  four  projects  being \nimplemented in 2018\u20132020 or proposed for approval in 2019\u20132020. Innovative features may \ninclude specific subject matters under road and rail safety, engineering design, resettlement and \nrehabilitation, environmental issues, disaster risk management including climate change risks, \ngender mainstreaming, communication, asset management, and project finance. This may be \naccomplished  through knowledge exchange, collaborative learning, or South-South partnership.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Knowledge products disseminated. To document the innovative features, \nknowledge  exchange,  collaborative  activities  developed  and/or  implemented,  at  least  three \nknowledge products will be prepared based on activities under output 1. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2016.

The \nTA will provide technical support to at least five government counterparts in the transport sector \nfor the preparation and monitoring of transport projects. Capacity building support will also be \nprovided through training, workshops, seminars and conferences related to the transport sector.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n11.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1.500 million which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The TA scope is expected to be expanded depending on changes in projects listed \nin the pipeline, new challenges that may arise in projects under implementation, and changing \nneeds of the executing agencies. The TA resources may also be replenished from time to time \nas and when funds are identified and required.11  \n \n12.  Activities in each participating country will be financed after obtaining the no objection from \nthe respective government. The governments were informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. In particular, the SATC will be responsible for implementing \nthe TA and working closely with government executing agencies in SARD DMCs. The TA will be \nimplemented from August 2018 to December 2020.
