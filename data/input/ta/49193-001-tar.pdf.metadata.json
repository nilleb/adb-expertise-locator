The Government of Mongolia requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to strengthen public procurement for improved project implementation. A fact-finding \nmission took place in Ulaanbaatar in June 2016, and ADB and the government reached an \nunderstanding on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference of the capacity development technical assistance (TA). \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As of 31 December 2015, the total value of the official development assistance (ODA)- \nfunded portfolio in Mongolia reached $3.2 billion.2 ADB\u2019s active loan and grant portfolio at the \ntime was $835.0 million, compared with $487.5 million on 31 December 2012. The increase in \nADB\u2019s portfolio in Mongolia is due to the country\u2019s access to ordinary capital resources since \n15 August 2011, and an increase in demand for ADB lending to address pressing development \nneeds.  The  sharp  increase  in  portfolio  size  and  complexity  requires  improved  government \nproject implementation capacity to deliver timely and quality project results. The government \nhas requested ADB TA to strengthen its capacity in moving from a decentralized system in \nwhich procurement is handled by line ministries and agencies, to the centralization of public \nprocurement in the Government Procurement Agency (GPA).  \n3.  Procurement  capacity  issues  are  often  aggravated  by  weak  governance  standards, \nwhich pose risks. These risks have been partially mitigated through the involvement of civil \nsociety organizations (CSOs) as bid evaluation committee (BEC) members. However, lack of \ncentralized oversight of the appointment of CSO representatives on BECs results in the arbitrary \nappointment of members who often lack the necessary expertise. Moreover, procurement audits \nand inspections do not have widespread civil society engagement. Greater involvement of \nCSOs in procurement audits and inspections will reduce governance risks and strengthen public \nsector  financial  management  in  Mongolia,  a  view  shared  by  development  partners  and \nTransparency International Mongolia. \n4.  ADB and its development partners regularly experience slow project start-ups, as a \nresult of delays in procurement and the selection of consultants. This has direct impacts on \nproject implementation and partly explains why project completion dates need to be extended \nfrequently to complete most projects (since 1991, 26 out of 28 closed ADB loans were extended \nbeyond the original closing date, with an average extension of 2 years). These implementation \ndelays could be mitigated through the introduction of advance procurement and consultants\u2019 \nrecruitment in Mongolia.3 However, the Budget Law, 2012 and the Public Procurement Law of \nMongolia, 2015 (PPLM), do not allow budget resources to be committed to a project before \nparliamentary approval.  \n5.  Procurement delays are mainly explained by (i) insufficient capacity of executing and \nimplementing  agency  staff  participating  in tender  evaluation  committees,  specifically  in  the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 February 2016. \n2  Source: Ministry of Finance. The data include assistance funded by development partners in Mongolia such as the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, ADB, the World Bank, German development cooperation through KfW, \nthe Korea International Cooperation Agency, the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China, and others. \n3  ADB. 2015. Enhancing Operational Efficiency of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. This policy paper, which \nbecame effective in February 2016, allows advance contracting and retroactive financing by default for all financing \nand TA proposals involving procurement and/or the recruitment of consultants. \n ", "2  \npreparation of qualitative bidding documents (i.e., lack of technical specialization, knowledge, \nand skills to perform procurement functions, including the design of technical requirements, \ntender document preparation, and evaluation and decision making); (ii) frequent staff rotation, \nwhich  reduces  institutional  memory  and  the  benefits  of  training  programs;  and  (iii)  poor \nunderstanding of ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines by BEC members. \n6.  The capacity constraints of executing and implementing agencies can be shown through \nthe delays incurred in finalizing bid evaluation reports and contract award recommendations by \nBECs. Frequent complaints are also received from bidders under both government- and ODA-\nfunded projects.4 To address these long-standing issues, the government, with ADB support, \nhas promoted a gradual shift of procurement responsibilities to the GPA\u2014the only professional \npublic  procurement  institution  in  Mongolia. 5  The  centralization  of  public  procurement \nresponsibilities in a professional procurement agency is in line with the Budget Law, 2012 and \nthe PPLM, 2015; and could facilitate more transparent, timely, quality procurement functions, \nand ensure consistent adherence to procurement rules and procedures. Centralization would \nalso allow line ministries to focus on core work, such as policy formulation and implementation, \nrather than procurement, which can be better handled by a professional agency.6 Since its \nestablishment  in  November  2012,  the  GPA  has  handled  procurement  transactions  worth \nMNT684.8 billion compared to a Government of Mongolia approved budget of MNT726.4 billion, \nresulting in MNT41.6 billion in savings to the Government of Mongolia highlighting agency \nefficiency. \n7.  Adequate regulations on procurement audit and inspections are also lacking. Since its \nintroduction in 2000, the PPLM has provided principles and policy mechanisms on procurement \naudit and inspections, but procedural regulations have not been developed because of lack of \nexpertise and limited knowledge of best international practices. The absence of regulations on \nhow  to  interpret  and  implement  the  PPLM  in  connection  with  procurement  audits  and \ninspections, combined with weak capacity in government institutions, affects public trust in the \ntransparency and rigor of the national public procurement system\u2014and the proper use of public \nfunds. The Ministry of Finance (MOF), ADB, and other development partners agree on the need \nto strengthen the capacity of the Mongolia National Audit Office, which conducts procurement \naudits and inspections as part of performance audits. However, many performance audits do \nnot audit procurement. In addition, inspectors and auditors often lack specialized training. This \nhighlights the importance of having a legal framework and procedures in place for conducting \nprocurement inspections and auditing.  \n8.  Economic development in Mongolia and decisive reforms to achieve a market-oriented \neconomy require the MOF and line ministries to manage contractual relations with international \ncontractors, suppliers, and consulting firms. However, many line ministries lack the experience \nto identify and choose appropriate contracts, and manage them in accordance with international \ngood practices for successful project implementation. The government plans to train relevant \nstaff on the most common types of international civil works, supply, and consulting services \ncontracts, and to improve understanding of and skills in contract management in accordance \n                                                \n4  According to MOF data, more than 200 complaints were received from bidders in 2015 on government-funded \nprojects, of which 47% were declared misprocurement or resulted in rebidding. On ADB-funded projects, at least \nseven complaints were filed in 2015, with one case resulting in misprocurement. \n5 According to Article 53 of the PPLM, the GPA is tasked to handle public procurement in Mongolia using government \nfunds except for projects implemented by the Development Bank of Mongolia, national security and defense-\nrelated procurement, and road construction implemented by state-owned enterprises (PPLM, Articles 3.4\u20133.6). \n6  The GPA has two main technical advantages over line ministries: (i) it has technical experts from various sectors; \nand (ii) it has a data archive, including previous tenders for all sectors, which ensures continuity.  \n ", "  3\nwith  international  good  practices.  The  MOF  has  requested  ADB  assistance  to  build  and \nstrengthen procurement capacity. \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be strengthened country portfolio performance. The outcome will be a \nstrengthened public procurement system in Mongolia for implementing government and ODA-\nfunded projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will support the government to (i) enhance its capacity to upgrade the regulatory \nframework for procurement inspections and audits through training and workshops; (ii) build \ngovernment staff capacity to handle the procurement transactions of ODA-funded projects; and \n(iii)  provide  advisory  support  for  the  introduction  of  advance  procurement  and  consultant \nrecruitment actions in the national legal framework to reduce project start-up delays, and to \nspeed up project implementation. These will be achieved through four outputs. \n \n11.  Output 1 will be the application of advance procurement action for ADB and other ODA-\nfunded projects in Mongolia. It will focus on raising awareness in executing and implementing \nagencies  and  in  Parliament  of  the  benefits  of  advance  procurement  actions  and  advance \nrecruitment  of  consultants  to  speed  up  project  implementation.  The  output  includes  an \nassessment of the existing legal environment to formulate recommendations to the government \nto  adopt  international  tools  of  advance  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment  actions  in \ngovernment and ODA-funded projects in Mongolia. \n \n12.  Output  2  will  be  strengthened  institutional  capacity  building  at  the  Legal  and \nProcurement Policy Department (LPPD) of the MOF. It will include capacity building of LPPD \nstaff by providing overseas and in-country training to increase experience in procurement audit \nand inspection operations, and international good public procurement practices. The output will \nalso provide technical advice and recommendations for developing regulation manuals and \nguidelines for public procurement inspectorate and audit operations in Mongolia. \n \n13.  Output 3 will be improved procurement capacity of government agencies, including the \nGPA.  It  will  provide  institutional  and  technical  capacity  building  from  an  international \nprocurement expert specialized in the procurement guidelines and procedures of ADB and other \nmultilateral development banks. It will include in-house support to government agency (including \nGPA) staff in charge of preparing bid documents, recruiting consulting firms, good international \npractices in bid evaluation, and preparing bid evaluation reports. The output will also assess the \ntraining needs of government agencies, design training programs, prepare training materials, \ndeliver  presentations,  and  examine  CSOs\u2019  involvement  in  BECs  to  increase  procurement \ntransparency. The TA output will provide opportunities for relevant staff to attend on-the-job \ntraining to gain experience and sharpen skills in international best public procurement practices. \n \n ", "4  \n14.  The implementing agencies will (i) organize an international study tour to countries that \nhave been successful in the focus area and (ii) prepare a short report outlining the main \ncontents and findings of the study tour. 7  \n \n15.  Output 4 will be enhanced skills of implementing agencies and the MOF in project and \ncontract  management.  Under  this  output,  the  TA  will  organize  targeted  training  in  the \nInternational  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  and  consulting  services  contracts,  and  in \nproject and contract management. This will help develop a solid understanding of international \nproject management good practices, and improve the skills of government staff in various \nsectors to implement complex contracts successfully with contractors, suppliers, and consulting \nfirms. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office space (fully furnished and equipped with computers, a \nprinter,  and  related  equipment  for  the  project  implementation  unit  and  with  operational \ntelephone and internet access), meeting and workshop venues, counterpart staff, other services \nto the consultants, assistance in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies, and other in-\nkind contributions.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The MOF will be the executing agency. The LPPD and the GPA will be the implementing \nagencies. The TA will establish a steering committee chaired by the MOF that will include \nofficials from the GPA, the LPPD, and ADB.8 The steering committee will convene at least twice \na year. ADB, in consultation with the MOF, will recruit a TA coordinator and an administrative \nand  finance  officer  to  manage  and  facilitate  project  implementation  and  day-to-day \norganizational  and  technical  matters.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  24  months  from \n1 November 2016 to 31 October 2018. \n \n18.  In  dialogue  with  the  executing  agency,  ADB  will  recruit  international  and  national \nconsultants to provide 17 person-months of international and 79 person-months of national \nconsulting  inputs.  The  main  tasks  will  include  introducing  the  advance  procurement  and \nconsultant  recruitment  action,  enhanced  procurement  inspection  and  audit  regulations, \nimproved contract and project management, and strengthened capacity building. All consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The consultants will be recruited on an individual basis since the \nTA requires varied expertise on a short-term engagement. Professional input from home office \nis not required, and the skills required are of unique nature where the quality of these services is \nof  paramount  importance.  Highly  specialized  procurement  policy  experts  are  more  easily \nrecruited individually than through a firm. \n \n                                                \n7  The international study tour and overseas training will be conducted in an ADB member country. The country will \nbe determined at TA inception, but could include Ireland, Singapore or the United Kingdom. \n8  ADB staff costs for assisting in the implementation and administration of the TA will be in accordance with the joint \nBudget, Personnel and Management Systems Department and Strategy and Policy Department memo dated 26 \nJune 2013 on the Use of Bank Resources, which provides guidance on charging costs either to the TA or to the \ninternal administrative expenses budget. \n ", "  5\n19.  Consultants will be responsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables in a timely \nand  effective  manner,  and  for  organizing  and  carrying  out  all  TA  activities.  To  support \nmonitoring and evaluation, consultants will submit inception, interim, draft final, and final reports \nto the government and ADB. \n \n20.  TA support for workshops may include costs related to logistic arrangements; venue; \ntravel of resource persons, including ADB staff and experts; supplies; and materials that will be \nused in training, seminars, and workshops. In line with standard ADB procedures, the TA will \nnot support the implementing agency\u2019s management fees or related costs such as staff salaries \nand  allowances,  and  the  use  of  implementing  agency  resources  (such  as  office \naccommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. Given the nature \nof the TA and to facilitate preparation and implementation, ADB may establish an advance \npayment facility with the MOF to support certain agreed cash expenditures, including workshops, \ntraining, seminars, the study tour, and conferences. Details of the proposed activities, including \ncost estimates, will be submitted through the executing agency to ADB for approval. ADB may \nalso make certain direct payments (e.g., for workshop venues).9 \n \n21.  The executing agency will provide a suitably furnished office with computers, utilities, \nand telecommunications access (including broadband internet connection). It will also supply \ndata and documents as required under the TA, and will cover the cost of office utilities for \nconsultants.  Project managers  designated  by  the  MOF  and  GPA  will  have  strong  English \nspeaking and writing skills, and will facilitate all TA activities and links to local government \nrepresentatives and providers to ensure the effective implementation of TA activities. \n \n22.  The TA will have project-specific indicators and targets, including timely implementation \nand quality progress reports. Policy dialogue will be maintained with the government and the \nsteering  committee  of  experts  established  by  the  executing  agency.  Consultation  and \ndissemination events will be organized at different stages of the TA implementation. Project-\nspecific issues will be addressed during review missions. ADB and the team leader will monitor \nTA implementation milestones.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Strengthening of Public Procurement for Improved Project \nImplementation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n9  Any advances provided in this facility will be liquidated within 30 days after the conclusion of the training activity. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nCountry portfolio performance strengthened (Strategy 2020; Mongolia COBP 2016)a \n \nPerformance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources \nResults Chain  and Baselines  and Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nPublic procurement  By 2020, at least 95% of sovereign  a.
