THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Independent State of Samoa for the Central Cross Island Road Upgrading Project. \n \n2.  The project will finance (i) the upgrade of about 20 kilometers (km) of national road \nincorporating climate-proofing considerations, innovative technologies, road safety measures, \nand gender-inclusive elements; (ii) 3-year routine maintenance with gender-inclusive elements; \nand (iii) gender-sensitive capacity strengthening for the road transport subsector. It will help meet \na key infrastructure need in Samoa\u2014improve, sustain, and climate-proof its road network and \nboost transport sector governance. \n \n3.  Samoa implemented quarantine measures because of a measles outbreak in late 2019 \nand the subsequent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which severely curbed economic \nactivity. The declining revenues and the government's stimulus expenditures to protect sectors \nand vulnerable groups led to forecasts of high fiscal deficits. The project is expected to help boost \nthe economy through local employment, tax revenues, and inflows of foreign exchange. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \n4.  The Government of Samoa requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to upgrade Central Cross Island Road\u2014a priority investment in the transport sector. \nThe project was originally part of the World Bank\u2019s assessment of critical road links to be covered \nby the Enhanced Road Access Project, which the government implemented in 2015 with World \nBank support, but was not finalized.1 In 2018, the World Bank approved a $35.75 million grant for \nthe Samoa Climate Resilient Transport Project to improve parts of West Coast Road and East \nCoast Road, both identified as vulnerable to climate change impacts.2 ADB financing was \nrequested to supplement these efforts to improve the road network infrastructure. This is one of \ntwo ADB-assisted transport projects in Samoa, the other is the Enhancing Safety, Security, and \nSustainability of Apia Port Project.3 \n \n5.  Samoa\u2019s coastal communities, where 70% of people live and where most public facilities, \neconomic infrastructure, and job opportunities are, rely heavily on coastal roads and cross island \nroads for their transportation needs. The main island, Upolu, features three cross-island roads \nalong  its  eastern,  western,  and  central  parts,  providing  access  and  livelihoods  to  inland \ncommunities. Central Cross Island Road is the key artery connecting West Coast Road in Apia\u2014\nthe country's capital, and the island's main commercial center and only deepwater port\u2014with \nSouth Coast Road in Siumu. It links 7,031 residents and various businesses along a 20 km stretch \nwith Apia and the southern edge of the island. Another 30,784 people living on the south coast \nrely on it as the shortest route to reach jobs and educational and social services in Apia. The two-\nlane carriageway is narrow (4 meters\u20135 meters) and carries up to 6,000 vehicles in average daily \ntraffic along the first 5 km, and up to 1,500 vehicles thereafter. It is costly to maintain; unsafe for \nroad users, particularly during heavy rains; and in urgent need of an upgrade. \n \n6.  The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan and is aligned with \nStrategy  2030  and  its  operational  priorities  of  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \n \n1  World Bank. 2013.

Rationale \n \n7.  A significant portion of the project road has fallen into disrepair and become unsafe for \ncommuters and for pedestrians walking alongside. This is especially an issue along the first 3 km \nof the road, a semi-urban area where school and college students dominate pedestrian traffic. \nTropical Cyclone Evan in 2012 caused significant damage to Samoa\u2019s transport infrastructure, \nincluding the project road. The government has since restored some of the worst-hit sections \n(3.67 km) of it, but the road remains narrow and lacks adequate pedestrian facilities in semi-urban \nareas, drainage is deficient along its entire length, and the road alignment in hilly sections is \nunsafe, all of which creates significant hazards, particularly in wet conditions. The project road is \nalso an alternative route between the northern and southern coasts for evacuation during a \ncyclone and for post-disaster relief. Hence, the upgrade of this critical link will contribute to a safer \nroad network and increase the island\u2019s climate and disaster resilience. \n \n8.  Samoa\u2019s economy is based on subsistence primary production. Crops, livestock, fisheries, \nand forestry account for 42% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and for 75% of employment. \nTourism is growing and represents 25% of gross domestic product. According to the Central Bank \nof Samoa, it is a key driver of economic development because it provides a large number of jobs \nand generates foreign exchange. The socioeconomic benefits of the road upgrade are expected \nto comprise (i) faster and safer access to public services, including schools and medical care; \n(ii) more  enrollments  in  tertiary  education;  and  (iii)  greater  economic  activity  from  better \nconnectivity, which in turn benefits tourism and increases employment for rural communities. \nThe upgrade is expected to lessen the burden on women in meeting their transport-dependent \nhousehold,  productive,  and  community  obligations.  Women  will  also  benefit  from  better \nopportunities for micro businesses and tourism-related activities. \n \n9.  The Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI) sets the sector policies, and \noversees and regulates infrastructure and services through its land transport, civil aviation, and \nmaritime transport divisions. Established under the Land Transport Authority Act 2007, the Land \nTransport Authority (LTA) is responsible for the planning, design, supervision, construction, and \nmaintenance of national roads and land transport infrastructure; and also manages road use. \nThis includes  promoting  vehicle  safety  and  safe  user  behavior,  regulating  the  transport  of \npassengers and goods by road, and managing traffic. The LTA funds capital investment projects \nfrom the national budget, and the World Bank provides grant funds for road rehabilitation works. \n \n10.  In  carrying  out  its  duties,  the  LTA  benefits  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  long-standing \ninvolvement in Samoa\u2019s road transport development and its considerable experience. The Samoa \nClimate Resilient Transport Project (footnote 2) will contribute to the sustainability of road \ninfrastructure investments by providing the LTA with sector and spatial planning tools to manage \nits  road  assets,  climate  change  vulnerability  assessments,  and  a  centralized  database  for \nrecording accidents. Moreover, in light of government agencies\u2019 ineffective project management \nin the past, which resulted in lengthy procurement and poor contract management, the World \nBank  project  will  provide  technical  advisors  to  strengthen  the  Aid  Coordination  and  Debt \nManagement  Division  (ACDMD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  Transport  and \n \n4  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nInfrastructure Sector Coordination Division (TISCD) set up under the MWTI, as well as technical \nsupport to the LTA. \n \n11.  Land registration information in Samoa has not been updated in pace with modern \ngeodetic systems, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) has limited \nland survey and information management capacity. This causes delays in defining property \nboundaries and resulted in incomplete data on road rights-of-way. Accurate topographical and \nboundary surveys are required to optimize road designs and avoid or minimize the need for land \nacquisition. The World Bank project is extending support to the MNRE to strengthen its land \nadministration system. The ADB project will complement these efforts by helping strengthen the \ncapacities of the MWTI and the LTA. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts, as per Goal 1 and Goal 2 of the \nGovernment\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Plan  2014\u20132019  (TSP):5  (i)  transport  sector  governance \nframework strengthened; and (ii) road transport network improved, sustained, and climate-\nproofed. The project will have the following outcome: Central Cross Island Road made more \nsustainable, more efficient, more climate-resilient, and safer.6 \n \n13.  Output 1: Central Cross Island Road upgraded and made safer. This output will \nfinance the upgrade of about 20 km of national road incorporating climate-resilient drainage \nfacilities  to  withstand  increased  rainfall  intensity;  and  road  safety  measures  for  the  safe \nmanagement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, particularly at times of heavier pedestrian \nmovements near schools and poor visibility because of climatic conditions. The project team will \nbuild road features that specifically cater to the requirements and welfare of women, vulnerable \nroad users, and nonmotorized traffic. This includes 8.4 km of footpaths, 18 streetlights, 18 safe \nbus stops, and 11 pedestrian crossings. The additions will collectively contribute to greater \ndisaster preparedness by making the road safely traversable in poor climatic conditions. The \nproject attempts to reduce the carbon footprint during construction by piloting an alternative \nbuilding method, i.e., recycling the existing road pavement instead of using raw materials from \nquarries; this will contribute to overall road industry sustainability. \n \n14.  Output 2: Maintenance of Central Cross Island Road improved. This output will \nfinance routine maintenance for three years starting immediately after the completion of the road \nupgrade.  It  involves  performance-based  contracting  of  national  contractors  and  community \nparticipation, targeting 30% of the contracted workforce to be women. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  to  manage  the  road  network  strengthened. \nThis output  will  finance  capacity  strengthening  to  complement  the  World  Bank\u2019s  initiatives. \nADB financing will cover (i) the engagement of an additional four nationally contracted TISCD \nstaff for procurement, gender, safeguards, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation, \nto support four specialists already provided through the World Bank project; (ii) training to the \nMWTI and LTA in project management, procurement, gender aspects, safeguards management, \nand  public  communications;  and  (iii)  additional  measures  to  build  women\u2019s  capacity  and \nleadership, such as (a) the formulation of the LTA\u2019s first institutional gender strategy to increase \nwomen\u2019s employment and their support in the workplace, (b) targets to include women in technical \ntraining, and (c) a gender-sensitive communication campaign on road and transport safety \n \n5  MWTI. 2014.

Value Added by ADB \n \n16.  The  project  design  incorporates  climate  adaptation,  road  maintenance,  road  safety \nenhancements, alternative road construction techniques to reduce the project\u2019s carbon footprint \n(pavement recycling and intelligent compaction), and gender-inclusive elements. ADB will finance \n100% of the project costs associated with these measures. This is the first major road project in \nSamoa to receive ADB support in tandem with World Bank efforts to improve the country\u2019s road \nnetwork. Without ADB\u2019s support, this important cross-island link would not receive its long \noverdue upgrade. The project\u2019s communication strategy includes participatory methods to ensure \nthat the road design is responsive to the needs of the road users and that adequate information \nis provided in a manner and form accessible to them, to mitigate disruptions during construction. \nThe strategy also includes behavior change communication to engage road users in safety \ncampaigns for motorists and pedestrians in various phases of project implementation. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $55.0 million (Table 1).

The government requested a grant not exceeding $40.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The summary financing plan is \nin Table 2. ADB\u2019s grant will finance the civil works, routine maintenance costs for 3 years,9 office \nequipment  and  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  and  capacity  building. \nClimate adaptation is estimated to cost $371,715 and ADB will finance 100% of the adaptation \ncosts. The government will finance expenditures for land acquisition and compensation, and \nvalue-added tax and duties.  \n \n7  This includes supporting all community members to understand women\u2019s concerns and ensuring that communication \nis tailored to the needs of women and girls, e.g., information is delivered in formats that women understand, and at \ntimes and locations that are convenient for them. \n8  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  The 3-year maintenance will be implemented within the grant closing date as shown in the project schedule (Linked \nDocument 4). \n ", "5 \n  \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund grant)  40.0  72.8 \nGovernment of Samoa  15.0  27.2 \nTotal  55.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MOF will be the executing agency, and the implementing agencies will be the MWTI, LTA, \nand MNRE. MOF will provide overall oversight, monitoring, and reporting through the ACDMD. \nThe LTA will manage the project day-to-day in accordance with ADB\u2019s applicable guidelines. The \nMWTI\u2019s  TISCD  is  responsible  for  the  overall  project  coordination.  LTA  will  have  overall \nresponsibility in managing land acquisition. Land and asset valuation and compensation will be \nimplemented  by  MNRE,  in  coordination  with  LTA  and  TISCD  following  the  project\u2019s  final \nresettlement plan.  \n \n20.  The LTA, jointly with the TISCD, will procure works and consulting services in accordance \nwith the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nprocurement regulations and guidance notes. To avoid COVID-19-related procurement delays, \ne-procurement will be used for the tender of the civil works packages. The Samoa Port Authority \nhas been using the Tenderlink network for the earlier ADB-financed project (footnote 3), and the \nLTA will use the Tenderlink system registered with the MOF. The ACDMD will ensure compliance \nwith the timely submission of audited project financial statements to ADB. Retroactive financing \nwill be used to allow contract signing and mobilization of the construction supervision consultant \nprior to grant effectiveness. The selection of the consultant is ongoing, and civil works bidding will \nstart in the fourth quarter of 2020. \n \n21.  The project preparation team undertook a comprehensive procurement risk assessment \nand a detailed supply market analysis to underpin value-for-money considerations when choosing \nprocurement arrangements. The project will achieve the best value for money by (i) using the e-\nprocurement  technology  to  lower  transaction  costs  and  ensure  transparency;  (ii)  attracting \ninternational and national contracting firms to the tender to ensure an optimal range of capacities \nfor delivering quality civil works\u2014the open competitive bidding being in two packages, one for \ninternational advertisement ($19.1 million), the other for national advertisement of two lots of \n$2.65 million each; and (iii) procuring international consulting firms through the quality- and cost-\nbased selection to ensure high-quality services. Further, the provisions concerning abnormally \nlow bids and standstills will also apply to civil works to maximize value for money. \n \n22.

The TISCD is led by \na division head and four nationally contracted staff for procurement, financial management, \nsafeguards, and monitoring and evaluation. The ADB team will contract another four senior staff \nfor the same subject areas, as well as office equipment, to cover the division\u2019s additional workload \nthroughout construction. The ACDMD is set up similarly but staffed with international specialists. \nThe LTA will implement all aspects of the project in close coordination with the TISCD and with \nits Project Management Division, which comprises six engineers, one safeguards specialist, and \ntwo support staff. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The technical feasibility of the project was tested initially by an ADB technical assistance \nat the preliminary design stage and firmed up by the detailed design carried out by the LTA with \nfunding from the United Nations Development Programme through the Green Climate Fund. \nThe road design is constrained by the island's topography and the need to balance the cost of \nconstruction and minimize land acquisition. To ensure climate resilience, the roadside drainage \ndesign is informed by hydrology and hydraulic analysis considering extreme climatic events. \nThe civil works will include (i) minor realignments and widening of the narrow carriageway (now \n4 meters\u20135 meters) for safe speeds of 40 km/hour in urban sections and 60 km/hour in nonurban \nsections; (ii) reconstruction of the road pavement for a 20-year design life\u2014asphalt for the traffic \ncarriageway (7.0 meters wide), hard shoulders and utility verge in urban areas (4.5 meters wide), \nand unsealed shoulders in nonurban areas (2.0 meters wide)\u2014and reconstruction of the sub-\n ", "7 \nbase and base course layers to carry the projected traffic loads; (iii) construction of road safety \nand roadside facilities with features that are gender-sensitive and user-friendly for vulnerable \npeople; and (iv) reconstruction and provision of new cross- and side drains to protect the road \nfrom climate-change-induced extreme rainfall events with high intensity and prolonged rainfalls.10 \n \n25.  An  assessment  of  road  safety  measures  by  the  International  Road  Assessment \nProgramme recommended higher road safety standards with at least a 3-star rating based on its \nrating system.11 The road design includes guardrails, streetlights, separate pedestrian footpath \nalong urban sections and in areas where pedestrian traffic is high, road signage and markings, \nbus bays, and vehicle speed-calming measures near schools and public markets. The detailed \ndesign also meets universal access requirements, such as wheelchair access to footpath and bus \nstops. A community consultation process was developed to determine suitable locations for bus \nshelters, lighting, and other facilities. Separate road safety campaigns for communities and drivers \nwill also be implemented. \n \n26.  The road design incorporates innovative technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of the \nproject, minimize costs, and increase resilience to excessive rainwater penetration of the road \nembankment. The detailed design provides for the cement stabilization of shoulders in nonurban \nroad sections. Pavement recycling is widely used in the United States and other developed \ncountries, and allows a reduction in a road project\u2019s carbon footprint, cuts construction time and \ncosts, and minimizes traffic disruptions during construction. This method is not so widely used in \nADB-financed  projects  due  to  limitations  in  local  standards,  perceived  risks,  and  lack  of \nknowledge and even less so in small Pacific islands where construction materials are scarce. The \nproject incorporates this technology by allowing alternative technical solutions during the bidding \nfor civil works. The bidding documents include specifications for reclamation of existing pavement \nmaterials to be placed as a road base. The technology reduces carbon emissions significantly \nduring construction by minimizing the extraction, transport, and placement of quarried materials. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  The project was not tested for its financial viability because it is not revenue-generating. \nThe economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. The evaluation of annual streams of project economic costs and associated \nbenefits under a baseline scenario yields an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 14.8%, \nand an economic net present value of $20.33 million. This confirms the project\u2019s economic \nviability, since it exceeds ADB\u2019s minimum required EIRR for investment projects of 9%. \n \n28.  Quantifiable benefits include reductions in vehicle operating costs and time savings from \ntraveling on the upgraded road, as well as fewer accidents and lower road agency costs because \nof greater road safety and more resilience to extreme climate events. The project is expected to \nreduce road deaths and severe injuries by 46%, bringing down the ratio of fatalities per year from \n0.59 to 0.32, and the ratio of fatalities and severe injuries per year from 6.5 to 3.5.12 Unquantified \nbenefits from the project include (i) less vulnerability to climatic events because of the availability \nof a reliable all-weather rescue route in case of disasters triggered by extreme weather; (ii) large \npotential gains in induced traffic, driven by a decline in vehicle operating costs and complementary \ndevelopments to stimulate socioeconomic and tourism activity; (iii) better health and education \n \n10 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 International Road Assessment Programme \u2013 Assessment of Central Cross Island Road, Samoa (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 Economic  and  Financial  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2). \nhttps://www.irap.org/methodology. \n ", "8 \noutcomes resulting from better access to health and school facilities; and (iv) generation of \nemployment opportunities from improved access to markets. \n \n29.  The project\u2019s sensitivity to changes in cost, demand, and benefits were tested (Table 4). \nGiven the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the project was tested for a simultaneous 20% increase \nin construction costs and a 20% drop in traffic levels. The project remains economically viable \nunder this adverse scenario with an EIRR at 9% and a net present value dropping to 0, which is \nthe switching value for the project. \n \nTable 4: Sensitivity Analysis \nScenario  NPV ($ million)  EIRR (%) \nBase case  20.33  14.8 \nConstruction costs increase by 20%  13.49  12.3 \nMaintenance costs increase by 20%  20.22  14.7 \nVehicle operating cost savings decrease by 20%  11.93  12.6 \nTravel time cost savings decrease by 20%  18.73  14.3 \nTraffic levels decrease by 20%  7.02  11.1 \nConstruction costs increase by 20% and traffic levels decrease by 20%  0.0  9.0 \nWithout accident cost savings  17.02  13.9 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nC.  Sustainability \n \n30.  Managing the road network is the responsibility of the LTA. Until June 2020, it was a public \ntrading body under the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act 2001, remitting a \ndividend to the government each year, such as ST102,309 ($39,034 equivalent) in fiscal year \n(FY) 2017.13 The key sustainability parameter for road investments is the government\u2019s ability to \nprovide a sufficient level of operation and maintenance (O&M) funding over the life of the \nupgraded road, especially as the LTA becomes entirely dependent on budgetary allocations. The \nsustainability of an investment will be assured through maintenance over its life cycle only if two \nkey  constraints  are  systematically  removed:  (i)  insufficient  maintenance  funding,  and  (ii) \ninadequate maintenance practices that cause premature road deterioration. The LTA\u2019s main \nsources of funds have been government and external grants through the national budget (about \n60%) and retained revenues from fees and charges (40%). \n \n31.  To manage a national road network of 1,255.7 km (816.5 km on Upolu and 439.2 km on \nSavaii), with 139 river-crossing structures (46 bridges, 19 fords, and 35 large culverts on Upolu; \nand 8 bridges, 19 fords, and 12 large culverts on Savaii),14 the LTA has spent an average of \nST32.8 million ($14.5 million equivalent) per annum from the national budget, of which ST13.6 \nmillion ($6.0 million equivalent) per annum (41%) was spent on capital works (including cyclone \nrehabilitation); and ST19.2 million ($8.5 million equivalent) per annum (59%) on routine, periodic, \nand emergency maintenance during 2013\u20132017. This is in addition to expenditure funded from \nexternal grants. The budget allocations during FY2016\u2013FY2020 increased from about ST13 \nmillion ($5.7 million equivalent) to ST19 million ($8.4 million equivalent), but are still short of the \nST35 million ($15.5 million equivalent) yearly target set in the TSP.15 \n \n \n13 Government directive dated 27 May 2020 changing the LTA\u2019s status to public beneficiary body. \n14 Updated figures are from a preliminary draft by the LTA following careful reconciliation of data sources. Adam Smith \nInternational. 2018. Renewals and Depreciation Funding Gap Assessment. London (July). \n15 The ongoing Renewals and Depreciation Funding Gap Assessment, funded by the Government of Australia, is \nreassessing the annual costs of asset depreciation. Its findings, coupled with the data from the Samoa Road Asset \nManagement System, will allow a reevaluation of the level of annual maintenance needed. \n ", "9 \n32.  Generally, the LTA strikes a reasonable balance between the need to preserve, repair, \nand upgrade its road assets. In FY2017, the LTA managed 24 grass-cutting contracts, 7 drainage \nmaintenance contracts, 1 traffic signal maintenance contract, and 22 routine road maintenance \ncontracts. The routine maintenance contracts were organized by zone (12 on Upolu and 10 on \nSavaii), had 2-year contract periods (introduced for the first time in FY2017), and involved \nperformance-based payments. Contractors are registered annually; in FY2019, 18 contractors \nwere registered for routine maintenance contracts on Upolu, and 13 for Savaii. \n \n33.  The project will finance performance-based routine maintenance for 3 years from the end \nof construction, and capacity building in tandem with the World Bank\u2019s ongoing efforts (para. 9) \nto  increase  the  LTA\u2019s  long-term  ability  to  manage  the  road  network  beyond  project \nimplementation.  More  specifically,  the  joint  focus  will  be  on  optimizing  the  LTA\u2019s  asset \nmaintenance strategies. \n \n34.  Samoa\u2019s relatively small economic base does not generate sufficient revenues for funding \nall sectors, hence unconventional O&M funding sources would have to be sought. Like other \nPacific countries, Samoa is disproportionately affected by the rising sea levels and the increase \nin extreme climatic events. At the same time, road transport generates about one-quarter of all \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, more than other sectors and subsectors.16 The GHG modeling \ndone for the project using the Highway Development and Management 4 (HDM-4) model predicts \nthat a reduction of about 14,000 tons of GHG can be achieved over the project life cycle (20 years) \nif optimal preventive maintenance regimes are applied to arrest premature road deterioration, \ne.g.,  keeping  traffic  operations  close  to  optimal  speeds  and  reducing  carbon  emissions. \nThis presents a potential to access carbon finance for O&M through new market mechanism(s) \nunder Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which is still under negotiation under the aegis of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. However, this would depend on the \nproject meeting eligibility criteria under the Paris Rulebook. In any case, the project will help \nstrengthen Samoa\u2019s policies and regulations on reducing GHG emissions from road transport.17 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n35.  The transport sector\u2019s strengths include a strong and effective policy framework supported \nby well-established procedures and guidelines; a well-structured and streamlined public sector, \nwith responsibilities defined and an appropriate arm\u2019s-length relationship between regulator and \nservice providers; a well-educated and motivated public sector workforce; and respect for the law. \nWeaknesses include a lack of up-to-date data on road and traffic conditions, resulting in an \ninability to assess the effectiveness of maintenance plans and works for the road network as a \nwhole;  and  institutional  capacity  limitations,  largely  stemming  from  lack  of  experience. \nThe priorities for capacity development lie mainly with minimizing sustainability risks through \nbetter life cycle maintenance planning and designs that ensure resilience to climate-change \nimpacts,  and  incorporating  better  safety  features  in  road  designs,  including  the  safety  of \npedestrians and other vulnerable road users. \n \n36.  The financial management assessment of the project found that MOF, as the executing \nagency and as the representative of the assistance recipient, is familiar with ADB\u2019s procedures \nand reporting requirements and has sufficiently robust financial management policies, systems, \nand procedures to meet ADB\u2019s requirements for the project. It will administer the advance account \n \n16 MNRE. 2015. Samoa\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution. Apia (presented at the 21st Conference of the \nParties [COP 21] in Paris). \n17 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nand has proven capacity. However, staff at the key implementing agencies\u2014MWTI, MNRE, and \nLTA\u2014are unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s procedures. The financial management risks associated with \nthese agencies are rated moderate.18 Actions to mitigate this weakness include workshops under \nthe project to explain ADB\u2019s financial management and disbursement requirements to the staff of \nMOF (ACDMD), the MWTI (TISCD), and the LTA to complement the earlier support by the World \nBank to establish and staff these centralized units (footnote 2). The project will also bolster the \nTISCD team by providing four more staff to support ADB-funded projects. MOF, the MWTI, and \nthe LTA agreed to implement financial management actions to strengthen their capacity. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the MOF, MNRE, LTA and MWTI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 8). Integrity due diligence was conducted on the \nLTA. No significant integrity risks were detected. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n38.  The project will particularly benefit the communities and businesses along the upgraded \nroad that rely on it to access economic opportunities (jobs, markets) and essential social services \n(schools, hospitals), which tend to be in Apia. Safer vehicle traffic, shorter travel times, and a safer \npedestrian environment, due to the footpaths and other new features, will reduce road accidents \nand improve mobility, especially for vulnerable groups such as women, school children, and the \ndisabled. While tourists continue to travel to the seaside resorts along the coastal road, an \nupgraded cross-island road is likely to encourage more locals to enjoy the seaside and more \ntourists to venture inland, which in turn stimulates economic activities. \n \n39.  This project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Women\u2019s concerns and needs \nvoiced during gender analysis and consultations are reflected in the road design with features \nsuch as lighting, pedestrian footpaths, covered bus shelters, speed signs, speed bumps, and \ngender-sensitive road safety training in schools and for village groups. To prevent gender-based \nviolence (including sexual harassment), the contractors will be required to provide mandatory \ntraining to all their staff on sexual exploitation and abuse, and HIV awareness. Women and girls \nhighlighted that they often feel unsafe on public transport. To rectify this, a campaign to prevent \nsexual harassment on buses will be implemented. In addition, analysis will be undertaken to \ndefine and address those gender dimensions of commuter safety that are under the jurisdiction \nof the LTA. The project will also support the LTA in developing its first institutional strategy to \nmanage gender issues in the workplace, which includes gender training and plans to support \nmore  women  in  the  workplace.  Finally,  income-generating  opportunities  for  women  will  be \nprovided through construction (10% of roles for women) and road maintenance (30% of roles for \nwomen). The project will also provide indirect benefits to women and girls by improving access to \npublic services such as education and health. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n40.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n \n18 Normally, an entity with limited experience in ADB procedures would be rated as posing a higher risk, but the planned \ncoordinating arrangements involving the ACDMD and TISCD, both supported by external advisors in critical project \nmanagement roles, will help reduce this risk.  \n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "11 \n41.  Environment (category B). The impacts of the upgrading, drainage, and resealing works \non a 20 km section of existing road will be site-specific, largely created during construction, and \nmost  of  the  foreseen  environmental  impacts  can  be  readily  mitigated  or  managed. \nThe environmental assessment found that the road runs through urban and rural areas of Apia, \nboth  already  highly  modified,  and  briefly  transverses  a  wider  area  designated  as  Apia \nCatchment\u2019s key biodiversity area; it is also an important bird area that supports endemic, \nendangered, or significant species. About 7 km of the road traverse disturbed forest and mountain \nforest within the boundary of the Apia Catchment\u2019s key biodiversity area. All construction works \nwill be entirely confined to the footprint of the road's existing right-of-way and to a degraded habitat \nwithin 1 km, which are not identified as natural habitats even though they are part of a wider area \ndesignated as critical habitat. The degraded vegetative zone between the road corridor and the \nnon-degraded forest may have habitat values, but does not satisfy the criteria for critical habitat. \nThe detailed assessment demonstrates that threatened species are unlikely to interact with the \nproject footprint, preferring to use less-disturbed habitats further away from the road. No net loss \nof critical habitat is likely to occur as a result of the project. The existing road and the proposed \nroad upgrade (construction limit-of-works) do not impinge on any areas of non-degraded or \nundisturbed forest. The assessment concludes that (i) the project can meet the three thresholds \nfor allowing a project to go ahead in an area of critical habitat; (ii) there are no significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts; and (iii) expected impacts will be construction-related, localized, and \nmanageable  if  the  mitigation  measures  are  implemented  and  closely  monitored.  As  a \nprecautionary basis, the contractor will be required to develop a biodiversity action plan, and \nprovisions are included in the environmental monitoring plan (EMP) to ensure that all lesser \nimpacts originating from project-related activities are mitigated to achieve at least no net loss of \nbiodiversity (i.e., no actual harm, nor loss, nor degradation of habitat). \n \n42.  The civil works will be tendered as two contract packages, and successful contractors will \nprepare their construction EMP based on the final EMP (updated at the detailed design stage) \nwith details of their construction methods and their approach to the main construction elements, \nthe risk assessment, and the mitigation measures.20 The LTA, supported by the construction \nsupervision consultant, will review and approve the construction EMP of each contractor prior to \nthe start of any physical works (including site clearance) on any section. The consulting team will \ninclude at least 30 person-months of environmental and health and safety specialists to work \nclosely with the LTA\u2019s safeguards officer. \n \n43.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The upgrade, including widening the road to a \n16-meter wide corridor, will require land acquisition and clearance of fences, hedges, trees, and \nsome small structures belonging to temporary roadside vendors. The project will need about \n130,322 square meters of land, affecting 159 land lots. It will also require an extension of the \neasement areas, totaling 6,021 square meters. However, there will be no requirement to change \nthe ownership of this land. The project will not result in impacts on residential or commercial \nstructures, so no forced physical displacement will take place. \n \n44.  A draft resettlement plan was prepared based on the detailed designs and disclosed on \nADB's website. During project preparation, community consultations were held in accordance with \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement, and those requirements shall continue to be met during the \nfinalization and implementation of the resettlement plan. Detailed measurement surveys and an \ninventory of losses were initiated in consultation with all affected persons. The TISCD and the \n \n20 This will include a health and safety plan aligned with the World Health Organization's 2020 considerations for public \nhealth  and  social measures  in  the  workplace in  the context  of  COVID-19.  https://www.who.int/publications-\ndetail/considerations-for-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-workplace-in-the-context-of-covid-19. \n ", "12 \nLTA will be responsible for the overall monitoring and supervision of safeguard activities, while \nthe MNRE will lead the land acquisition and compensation for all affected assets. The supervision \nteam will have at least 25 person-months of social safeguard, gender, and communication \nspecialists who will assist the TISCD, LTA, and MNRE during project implementation. A grievance \nredress mechanism will be implemented by the LTA, as outlined in the draft resettlement plan. \n \n45.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project beneficiaries are not considered as being \neither distinct from mainstream society or vulnerable. Nonetheless, all project activities will be \nundertaken in a culturally appropriate manner. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n46.  The project risks were identified based on lessons learned by ADB and the World Bank in \nSamoa. None of the risks were assessed as being highly likely or having the potential to \nsignificantly alter project outputs and outcome. The detailed risk assessments are in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan and project procurement risk assessment.21 ADB\u2019s own \nexperience in Samoa indicates that land acquisition is generally complex and time-consuming. \nThe  level  of  project  readiness,  stakeholder  consultations  conducted  to  formulate  a  draft \nresettlement plan, and project resources allotted to ensuring continued support to acquire the land \nrequired  for  the  project  helped  bring  the  associated  level  of  risk  significantly  down. \nAffected persons are supportive of the upgrade. \n \n47.  The LTA\u2019s recent assessment indicates an O&M funding shortfall of about 30%. This is a \nsubstantial risk, which will be mitigated by the government's commitment to allocate ST35 million \nto the LTA to cover for O&M in line with the requirements of the TSP. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n48.  The Government through MOF and LTA have assured ADB that the implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  requirements,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  financial \nmanagement, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and grant documents. \n \n49.  The Government through MOF and LTA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \nthe project, which are set forth in the draft grant and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n50.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$40,000,000 to the Independent State of Samoa from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the Central Cross Island Road Upgrading Project, on terms and conditions \nthat are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant and project agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n 9 November 2020\n \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan, and Project Procurement Risk Assessment of Samoa\u2019s Land \nTransport Authority (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  13 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with  \nTransport sector governance framework strengthened (Transport Sector Plan, 2014\u20132019)a \nRoad transport network improved, sustained, and climate-proofed (Transport Sector Plan, 2014\u20132019)a \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2027:     \nCentral Cross Island  a.
