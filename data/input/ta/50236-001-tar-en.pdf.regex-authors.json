THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Rationale. The core problem of the agriculture, natural resources and rural development \nsector in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) can be summarized as low agricultural \nproductivity, quality, diversity, and unrealized trade potential, with a rapidly eroding natural \nresource production base due to physical, economic, and capacity constraints. Climate change \nimpacts are exacerbating losses in agriculture investments, increasing the risks of food insecurity, \npoverty, and inequality.  \n \n2.  The  proposed  Sustainable  Rural  Infrastructure  and  Watershed  Management  Sector \nProject (the project) will increase the profitability of the agriculture, natural resources and rural \ndevelopment sector to be aligned with the following impact: sustainable and inclusive rural \ndevelopment achieved.1 Its outcome will be sustainable, market oriented agricultural production \nand natural resources management in selected watersheds enhanced. The project has three \noutputs: (i) productive rural infrastructure (PRI) upgraded to be climate resilient, efficient, and \nsustainable;  (ii)  land  use  management  within  the  PRI  scheme  watersheds  improved;  and \n(iii) institutional  arrangements  and  capacity  for  good  agriculture  practices  and  sustainable \nwatershed management improved. \n \n3.  The indicative investment cost of the project is estimated at $56.7 million, including $30.0 \nmillion concessional ordinary capital resources loan, $4.7 million grant from the ADB Disaster \nRisk Reduction Fund, $10.0 million grant from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), $10.0 million loan \nfrom GCF, and $2.0 million from the government as counterpart funding. Out of this amount, the \namount of climate change adaptation is estimated to cost $35.0 million. ADB will finance $15.0 \nmillion and GCF will finance $20.0 million. In addition, The Food and Agriculture Organization of \nthe United Nations (FAO) parallel cofinancing from GCF estimated at $15.0 million is envisaged.2 \nThe project is included in the Lao PDR Country Operations Business Plan (2017-2019). \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n4.  A transaction technical assistance (TRTA) is needed to help the government to prepare \nthe ensuing project. It will define the scope, cost, procedures for identifying subprojects, financing \nplan, implementation arrangements, procurement, technology issues, capacity development, \nmaintenance arrangements, and adherence to ADB safeguard policies. It will also provide \nadvance action support to enhance project readiness, as well as to ensure that PRI is designed \nin a climate change resilient manner.3 The TRTA draft final reports will include the whole set of \nADB-required project documents (report and recommendation of the President and its linked \ndocuments and supplementary documents) and GCF-required documents including the concept \npaper and the full application for both the ADB and FAO GCF proposals.4  \n \n                                                \n1  This is aligned with the 8th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2016-2020) and the National Strategy \non Climate Change (2010). \n2  Whereas ADB\u2019s strength lies with the development of infrastructure, partners are needed to realize the full impact of \nthe project. The project will enter into a parallel cofinancing with the FAO. They will lead a consortium that will assist \nto  implement  watershed  management,  capacity  development,  rural  credit  schemes,  and  improve  hydro-\nmeteorological monitoring. The consortium is expected to include: International Water Management Institute, \nInternational Rice Research Institute, and other organizations and experts.  \n3  First appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 May 2017. \n4  See http://www.greenclimate.fund/funding/proposal-approval/fine-print for the GCF approval process.  \n ", "2 \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n5.  Output 1: Sector and institutional analyses will be prepared by the consultants as part \nof the inception report to be produced to identify gaps, issues and opportunities for strengthening \nthe institutions to support the project activities. Based on these findings, the report will include \nthree main sections corresponding to three outputs of the ensuing project as follows:  \n \n(i)  PRI. The TRTA will (a) assess impact of climate variability and climate change and \nassociated issues on the selected PRI, and develop measures for increased climate \nresilience for these PRI; (b) assess impact of PRI on aquatic ecosystems and fisheries \nand develop mitigation measures; (c) develop criteria and guidance for the selection of \nPRI schemes; and (d) prepare a list of PRI schemes for which feasibility studies will be \nprepared during the TRTA and during implementation. \n \n(ii)  Land use management in PRI scheme watersheds. The TRTA will (a) develop \nguidelines  for  upstream-downstream  cooperation  in  the  selected  watersheds; \n(b) recommend feasible watershed management measures for the selected subprojects; \nand  (c)  study  political  economy  and  capacities  and  provide  recommendations  for \nwatershed planning. \n \n(iii)  Institutional strengthening and capacity building for sustainable watershed \nmanagement. The TRTA will: (a) develop institutional arrangements at the provincial level \nto  ensure  inter-agency  coordination;  (b)  develop  a  hydro-meteorological  monitoring \nframework for application in the subproject watersheds; and (c) prepare a capacity building \nprogram for good and climate smart agriculture practices and for sustainable watershed \nmanagement.   \n \n6.  Output  2: Feasibility  studies  prepared for three  to five  subprojects.  Based  on \ntechnical and social surveys from output 1, feasibility studies of three to five subprojects that will \nwill be prepared. The feasibilities will include climate-resilient preliminary designs, economic and \nfinancial analysis, and social and environmental safeguards. These feasibility studies will serve \nas the model for studies of further subprojects during project implementation.   \n \n7.  Output 3: Detailed engineering designs (DEDs) and bidding documents. The TRTA \nwill prepare climate-resilient DEDs and bidding documents for three to five selected subprojects. \nAdvance actions will also be undertaken for the procurement of these subprojects.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n8.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $2.04 million equivalent, of which $1.50 million is financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and $0.50 million on a grant \nbasis by the Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund5 (PRITF), both administered by ADB. \nThe government will finance the remaining balance in-kind. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 1.  \n \n9.  Under the JFPR, ineligible expenditures include: (i) purchase of vehicles; (ii) salaries for \ncivil servants; (iii) any foreign travel; (iv) scholarships or long internships; (v) detailed engineering; \n                                                \n5 Financing partner: Nordic Development Fund. \n ", "3 \n(vi) civil works and other related expenses; and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or \nNegative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.6 \n \n10.  Under the PRITF, expenditures can support project preparatory-related activities which \nare not covered by the Technical Assistance Special Fund resources and/or by cofinancing from \nexternal sources or other ADB-administered trust funds. These include: (i) preparation of DEDs; \n(ii) preparation and launch of bidding documents; (iii) guidance on advanced procurement; and \n(iv) additional feasibility studies, not included in the original TRTA scope, related to project \nreadiness and addressing climate change, such as but not limited to estimation of costs for \nadaptation, detailed climate risk and vulnerability assessment, developing baseline data. \n \n11.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff, \nsecretarial assistance, provision of office space, communication facilities, and other in-kind \ncontributions with the value estimated at about 2% of the total technical assistance cost. The \ngovernment was informed that approval of the TRTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.
