Based on the findings and recommendations of an approved technical assistance (TA),1\nthe Royal Government of Bhutan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for an advisory\nTA to assist the Government in the Road Planning and Management Strengthening Project. The\nTA is included in ADB\u2019s Country Assistance Plan for Bhutan for the year 2000. An ADB fact-\nfinding mission visited Bhutan from 29 October to 9 November 1999 and reached understanding\nwith the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation\narrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services of the TA.2\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The road sector in Bhutan has been developing at a steady pace since the late 1950s.\nFor the past 30 years, the Indian Border Roads Organization (IBRO) has undertaken the vast\nmajority of the construction and maintenance works on the national road network through the\nDANTAK project.3 Over the last decade however, responsibility for the national road network\nhas been gradually shifted to the Government. At this time, IBRO still maintains about 478\nkilometers of the national highway network. The Government is expected to eventually assume\nresponsibility for those sections as well. The institution responsible for planning the national\nroad network is the Policy and Planning Division (PPD) within the Ministry of Communications\n(MOC). The institution responsible for managing the national road network is the Department of\nRoads  (DOR)  within  MOC.  As the  Government  invests  in  the  steady  development  of  the\nnational road network and gradually assumes responsibility for its maintenance, the network\nhas remained serviceable but requires significant investments.\n3. The objectives  of  the  current  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (1997-2002) are  to  develop  a\nregionally balanced network that is safe, convenient, and economical to use, and to preserve\nthe past capital investment in roads, reduce cost of vehicle operation and travel time of road\nusers, and develop road construction and maintenance capabilities in the private sector. ADB\u2019s\nstrategic objective in the road sector is to improve planning, construction, and maintenance to (i)\nintegrate the domestic market; (ii) enhance access to local, regional, and international markets;\n(iii)  increase  employment  opportunities  and  incomes,  especially  in  rural  areas,  to  reduce\npoverty; (iv) stimulate private sector activity, especially in rural areas; and (v) develop public-\nprivate  partnerships  for  planning,  management,  and  implementation  of  construction  and\nmaintenance of the national road network.\n4. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government in the road sector has concentrated on the\ninstitutional strengthening of DOR to enable it to take over from IBRO the responsibility for\nplanning and managing the national road network. The ADB\u2019s last loan project to Bhutan,4\nemphasized  (i)  improving  governance  by  institutional  strengthening,  (ii)  more  efficiently\nallocating  funds  for  road  maintenance  operations,  (iii)  developing  the  domestic  road\nconstruction industry, (iv) establishing a framework for contracting roadworks, and (v) improving\ncost recovery in the road sector through appropriate user charges. Currently, ADB\u2019s sector\nstrategy continues to address the same policy areas, and aims at improving governance by\nstrengthening PPD and DOR to (i) develop an appropriate road planning and management\nsystem, to facilitate efficient budget allocations for road sector development and maintenance\n                                               \n1  TA 3107-BHU: Road Transport Network Development Project, for $650,000, approved on 3 December 1998.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 2000.\n3  DANTAK is the IBRO project that constructed the national highways in Bhutan.\n4  Loan 1265-BHU(SF): East-West Highway Maintenance Project, for $5.2 million, approved on 18 November\n1993.", "2\nactivities; (ii) introduce a more participatory approach for the beneficiaries in planning and\nimplementation, to contribute to poverty reduction; (iii) improve road safety; (iv) develop the\ndomestic consulting profession; and (v) assist the Government in drafting legislation on the\nproposed road act.\n5. DOR,  a young  organization  with  limited  professional  staff  resources,  is  in  a  steep\ndevelopment curve and has struggled to acquire the skills and experience it needs to construct\nand maintain the national road network. DOR must now transform itself from an implementing\nagency and supervisor of work into the \u201cowner\u201d of the work and employer of consultants and\ncontractors. It must shift from being the implementer of the projects to being the manager. At\nthe same time, the contracting community must invest in modern tools and technologies and\nupgrade its practices to be consistent with international standards. The fledgling consulting\nprofession in Bhutan must be strengthened in order to have the key role as the supervisor and\ncertifier of works, and to instill confidence in DOR that consultants can successfully manage that\nrole.\n6. The  proposed  Road  Improvement  Project  will  be  implemented  based  on  the\nGovernment's new contracting and procurement framework, and includes a number of features\ndesigned to strengthen DOR, and  local  contractor  and  consultant engineering  capabilities.\nHowever, specific assistance for capacity building of PPD and DOR is required. PPD\u2019s and\nDOR's capability to plan and manage the national road network and perform their development\nand maintenance functions must be strengthened as they evolve into their new role. Proper\nplanning entails due consideration of technical, economic, financial, and administrative factors\nand,  just  as  importantly,  of  environmental  and  social  impacts.  Roads  are  built  to  serve\ncommunities  as  well  as  vehicle  operators;  therefore  the  affected  communities  must  be\nparticipants in the road planning process. PPD and DOR need to develop a road sector master\nplan (RSMP) and establish appropriate procedures for implementing the plan\n7. The planning process can provide intended benefits only if identified plans and programs\nare implemented. For this to happen, the budgeting process must provide funding based on\npriorities established through the planning process. When programs are curtailed due to funding\nconstraints, plans must be adjusted accordingly. In modern road sector organizations, support\nto the planning and budgeting process is accomplished through the effective application of\nappropriate information technology. The latter is particularly important since under a prior TA,5 a\nmaintenance management system was developed, but it was not implemented successfully\nmainly due to the use of complex computer tools and the lack of technology transfer to DOR\nstaff.  Therefore,  strengthening  of  PPD\u2019s  and  DOR\u2019s  functions  must  coincide  with  the\ndevelopment of appropriate asset inventory data and related training.\n8. The Government requires a modern and efficient road sector organization to effectively\nplan and manage its developing network to allow the road sector to contribute to the social and\neconomic development of the country. PPD and DOR have already taken steps to improve the\nefficiency of their delivery of services. To build upon the initial successes, PPD and DOR need\nto improve governance by strengthening their capacities for planning and managing the road\nsector.\n                                               \n5  TA 1984-BHU: Development of a Maintenance Management System, for $390,000, approved on 18 November\n1993.", "3\n9. Regarding road sector legislation, the Government has, over the years, taken steps to\naddress legal issues through diverse acts, rules, regulations, and guidelines issued by various\nGovernment agencies. The various legislations are (i) the rules and regulations for construction\nof temporary, semipermanent, and permanent houses on either side of a road, issued by the\nMinistry of Home Affairs in 1993; (ii) the Road Safety and Transport Act 1999, issued by MOC;\n(iii) the Field Manual of Road Maintenance, issued by DOR in 1989; (iv) the bioengineering\ntechniques for slope protection and stabilization, issued by DOR in 1999; (v) the Environmental\nCode of Practices for Highways and Roads, issued by  DOR  in  September  1999;  (vi)  the\nMunicipal Act of 1999, issued by the MOC; (vii) the Mines and Minerals Management Act 1995,\nissued by the Department of Geology; (viii) the Land Act (second edition 1998), issued by the\nMinistry of Home Affairs; and (ix) the environmental guidelines on roads and highways, issued\nby the National Environment Commission in 1999.\n10. With  the  multiplicity of  interrelated  legislation,  there  is  no  coordinated  and  focused\napproach through a single piece of legislation covering road and road transport in Bhutan. Also,\nthe agencies responsible for particular sectors are primarily concerned with safeguarding their\ninterests, resulting in conflicting rules and regulations. Further, the enforcement mechanisms\nare varied and uncoordinated. The Government is of the view that a coordinated legislation is\nneeded as the road network is the predominant means of transport within the country and the\nnumber  of  road  users  and  vehicles  is  increasing.  Also,  authority  and  responsibility  for\nenforcement must be clearly delineated. The Government has noted its need for draft legislation\non the proposed road act to cover road and road transport in Bhutan.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n11. The objectives of the TA are to (i) prepare the RSMP; (ii) improve the capacity of PPD\nand DOR in planning and securing sustainable financing for the national road network and road\nmaintenance programs, including a comprehensive road asset inventory database; (iii) train\nPPD and DOR staff on appropriate planning tools; and (iv) prepare draft legislation on the\nproposed road act. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n12. The TA will focus on (i) planning and financing of the road sector, (ii) technology transfer,\nand (iii) legislation for roads and road transport.\n13. Planning and Financing of the Road Sector. The long-term RSMP will be developed\nfor network expansion, rehabilitation, and maintenance. The plan will cover required investment\nin new roads and bridges. The exercise will include definition of planning data requirements,\ncollection of available data, review of road classification, evaluation of rehabilitation and periodic\nmaintenance alternatives, and recommendation of improvement policies. The road planning\nprocess must be based on objective technical and economic analysis and the formulation of\nplans and programs must be soundly conceived. Road planning must be a continuing process\nto ensure that programs adopted are responsive to changing times and have the necessary\nfinancial and public support to be implementable. The study will address the current user\ncharges and will determine whether these charges are appropriate in terms of cost recovery.\nThe TA will assist PPD and DOR to implement improvements by:", "4\n(i)  developing  a  stable  organizational  unit  with  dedicated  professional  staff\nsupported  by  field  units,  trained  and  equipped  to  use  appropriate  planning\ntechnology  and  responsible  for  maintaining  planning  data  and  preparing\neconomically justifiable programs;\n(ii)  providing access to appropriate technical methods and training in engineering\nand  information  technology  such  as  the  highway  design  and  management\n(HDM)6 model, which is applied in many developing countries; and\n(iii)  building public support, through stakeholder participation to ensure that priorities\nare based on technical and economic considerations and that the necessary\nfunding is made available.\n14. Technology Transfer. Effective planning depends upon appropriate tools based on\ninformation technology, and training of staff that will implement these tools. The staff must have\naccess to simple, accurate, and comprehensive data on the existing national road network and\non broader areas such as land use, economics, and demographics. The TA will include the\nintroduction of the, implementation of, and training on effective and simple computer-based road\nplanning tools, and the development of a road asset inventory database and related road\nplanning data.\n15. Legislation for Roads and Road Transport. The TA will take into account the existing\nlegislation on road-related matters, and prepare draft legislation on the proposed road act,\ntaking  into  account  the  views  of  the  Government,  local  communities,  nongovernment\norganizations, and other stakeholders, including road users (such as vehicle owners, users of\npublic transportation, and freight transporters). The proposed draft legislation will (i) clearly\ndefine the responsibilities and rights of the provider (the Government), road users, and affected\ncommunities; (ii) address the construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, and use of the road,\nwhile  safeguarding  or  mitigating  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  on  users  and  the\ncommunity at large; (iii) spell out the compensation to be paid in accordance with existing\nlegislation in the acquisition of land, including rights-of-way, for road construction; (iv) determine\nthe feasibility of levying user charges to recover the cost of maintaining the national road\nnetwork; (v) specify the agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing the provisions of the\nlegislation; and (vi) prescribe the penalties for violating road statutes.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,127,000 equivalent, consisting of $740,000 in\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $387,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance\n$954,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $214,000 equivalent in local\ncurrency cost. The Government has agreed to finance the items specified  in Appendix 2,\nestimated at $173,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and\nfinancing plan is presented in Appendix 2.\n                                               \n6  HDM model was developed by the World Bank. ADB is a partner in the development and related training of the\nnew version of the model called HDM 4, under TA 5819-REG: Highway Development and Management Model 4\nTraining and Dissemination in the Asian and Pacific Region, for $700,000, approved on 8 December 1998.", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n17. International  consultants  (about  18  person-months  of  total  services)  working  in\nassociation with domestic consultants (about 60 person-months) will be required to carry out the\ntasks under the TA. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are given in Appendix 3.\nThe international consultants will have expertise in road network planning and management,\nand  road  agency  institutional  strengthening;  road  and  road  transport  legislation,  and\ndevelopment  of  institutional  capabilities;  and  computer-based  road  network  planning  and\nfinancing tools (including the application of HDM model) and road asset inventory databases.\nThe consultants will be led by an international road transport planner and economist. The\ndomestic consultants will have expertise in road transport planning and operations (including\nroad sector legislation), highway planning and maintenance operations, information systems\ndevelopment and implementation, and road asset inventory databases. The consultants will be\nrecruited by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The equipment\nand software will be procured by the consultants in accordance with arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB. The consultants are expected to commence their services in October 2000, and the TA\nis expected to be completed by December 2001.\n18. PPD will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The head of PPD will be the project\nmanager of the TA and will be responsible for coordinating TA activities with DOR, other\nGovernment agencies, and the consultants. The Government will use the draft legislation on the\nproposed road act, prepared under the TA, as a basis for enactment of the proposed road act.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Royal Government of Bhutan in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $954,000 for the purpose of the Road Planning and\nManagement Strengthening Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nIndicators/ Targets\nGoal\nA well-planned, accessible, Increase in gross domestic Government economic and The national road network\nsafe, and reliable national product, social indicators, and social statistics contributes to socioeconomic\nroad network that is reduction of poverty. development and improved\ndesigned, built, and quality of life.\nmaintained in a technically Satisfaction of road network Road user satisfaction\n(\nR correct, environmentally- users improves as a result of surveys\ne\nf friendly, and cost-effective better and safer roads.\ne\nr\ne manner, promoting economic\nn\nc activity and providing access Road user costs on the road Road user cost surveys\ne\n in to health, education, and network decrease annually.\n te other social services.\nx Road condition-related Road accident statistics\nt: 6\n \np accidents decrease annually.\na\ng\ne\n 3 Purpose\n,\n p Improve governance by DOR provides the DOR management and Sufficient revenues are\na\nr strengthening the capacity of Government with higher operational reports generated and funds\na\n. 1 the Department of Roads quality planning and allocated for road\n1 (DOR) and the Policy and investment information.
