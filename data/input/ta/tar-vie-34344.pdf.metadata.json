Since the advent of  doi moi (economic renovation), the Government of Viet Nam has \nrecognized the small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector as a core component for the \ncountry\u2019s  socioeconomic  development.1  With  the  sector\u2019s  high  potential  for  increasing \ninvestments, generating employment, and reducing poverty, the Government has requested the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  assistance  in  SME  development.2  As  outlined  in  the \ntechnical assistance (TA) framework in Appendix 1, this project preparatory TA will design and \nprepare for a SME development program loan (SDPL), which is included in the 2001 country \nstrategy and program (CSP) for Viet Nam.3 A fact-finding mission fielded in October 2002 \nreached an understanding with the Government on the purpose, approach, and implementation \narrangements of the TA.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  With an average annual growth of gross domestic product (GDP) during 1990\u20131999 at \n8%, the Vietnamese economy grew more than three times the world average. Viet Nam has \nalso been one of the most successful countries in reducing poverty. From the mid 1980s to the \nlate 1990s, the proportion of people living in poverty has dropped from about 70% to just more \n30%. The SME sector has had an important role in this rapid economic growth and reform, as it \nmakes up 96% of all firms and 49% of nonagriculture employment. Currently, Viet Nam has \nabout 80,000 SMEs, more than 40,000 of which have officially registered in the last 2 years, \nfollowing the introduction of the Enterprise Law.5 Among these, about 60% are in services and \ntrade,  followed  by  36%  in  manufacturing.  Only  about  3%  of  registered  firms  are  in  the \nagriculture  sector,  mainly  because  most  of  them  have  registered  previously  as  either \ncooperatives or family-owned enterprises. As this sector is critical for employment generation/ \npoverty reduction, it will also be addressed in the TA, in accordance with previous ADB projects.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s CSP for Viet Nam identifies SME development as a means to ensure pro-poor, \nsustainable growth.6 Through ADB\u2019s public sector window, the CSP calls for supporting the \ndevelopment of a policy and institutional framework conducive to expansion of the private \nsector. This also identifies private sector development as a key means for providing the state-\nowned enterprises (SOE) reform. Several recent ADB operations are related to this approach, \nincluding (i) the State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Program Loan, \nwhich aimed at reforming the SOE sector;7 (ii) two financial sector program loans, which aimed \nat developing alternative financial channels and laying the foundation for financial and legal \n                                                 \n1  The Government of Viet Nam. 2001. The Ten-Year Socio-Economic Development Strategy. Hanoi. Appendix 2 \nprovides more details. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 22 July 2002.  \n3  The SDPL is in the pipeline for 2004 as a sector development program loan.  \n4  The Mission comprised Jin W. Cyhn (Economist).  \n5  The Enterprise Law came into effect in 2000. Its aims are to (i) clarify and streamline the business registration \nprocess, (ii) reduce the registration requirements to a more practical level, and (iii) introduce provisions for the \nGovernment agencies involved in the process.  \n6  In addition, ADB initiated a sector study to examine the major issues faced by the SMEs. The sector study was \nconducted by a staff consultant for 3 person-months, from April to July 2002.  \n7  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board and Directors on Loan to Viet Nam for the \nState-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Program. Manila. ", "2  \ninfrastructure;8 and (iii) the Rural Enterprise Finance Project, which provides mid- and long-term \ncredits as well as business development services to rural-based small enterprises.9  \n  \n4.  Many recent activities have made the support of the private and SME sectors timely and \nimportant. First, the Government issued the Decree 90 in 2001, which marks the first time that it \nhas  officially  defined  and  recognized  the  SMEs.10  Second,  based  on  the  decree,  the \nGovernment has created the formal institutional system to promote SMEs. To coordinate among \nministries, the SME Encouragement Council has been created, and the SME Department within \nthe Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will become the focal point. Furthermore, the \nSME sector has received considerable international assistance? almost 50 projects have taken \nplace by 2002. These recent activities indicate that the Government and external agencies have \nemphasized SMEs\u2019 significant role in the socioeconomic development of Viet Nam, especially \nas it comprises much of the private sector. \n \n5.  Nevertheless, Viet Nam\u2019s SME sector continues to face challenges that relate to the \nnascent stage of private sector in the Vietnamese economy. Furthermore, SME development is \na relatively new task for Viet Nam, and the sector still faces various obstacles while receiving \nlimited assistance from the Government.  \n  \n6.  Limited SME Promotion Framework. Despite recent efforts by the Government and \nexternal agencies, a framework for SME promotion is still incomplete, both in terms of policy \nand  institutions.  Because  the  SME  Department  and  Encouragement  Council  are  not  yet \nadequately staffed, the Government has been unable to effectively formulate and implement \npolicies  for  SME  promotion.  The  many  externally  funded  activities  on  SMEs  are  mostly \nscattered and narrowly focused without clear strategic priorities or a long-term perspective. The \ndevelopment of the overall framework is essential for the SME development that encompasses \nthe other major challenges (paras. 7\u20139).  \n \n7.  Constrained Legal Environment for SMEs. Although Viet Nam has been trying to \ndevelop a legal framework appropriate for a fair competitive business environment, a number of \nobstacles to SME development remain. These include delays in granting land use certificates, \nas well as complicated and cumbersome business licensing systems and procedures. The land \nuse issuance is important because SMEs have limited access to bank credit, in part because \nthey are unable to provide the certificates as collaterals.11 A survey by the Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  identified  the  collateral  issue  as  the  most  significant  problem  in \nattaining bank credit. 12  \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board and Directors on Loan to Viet Nam for \nFinancial Sector Program Loan I. Manila. ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nand Directors on Program Loan Cluster to Viet Nam for Second Financial Sector Program. Manila. \n9  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board and Directors on Loan to Viet Nam for \nRural Enterprise Finance Project. Manila.  \n10 Decree of the Government (No.: 90/2001/CP-ND), Supporting for Development of the Small and Medium Sized \nEnterprises. According to the decree, SMEs are defined as firms with charted capital of VND10 billion (about \n$650,000) or with less than 300 employees. \n11 Although  the  Land  Law  does  not  distinguish  against  the  private/SME  sector,  the  limited  allocation  to  the \nprivate/SME sector seems clear. A survey by Japan Bank for International Cooperation in 2001 shows that only \nabout 14% of SMEs have benefited from the land use certificate issuance. The problem is mostly for manufacturing \nand  trade  SMEs.  As  of  January  2000,  land-use  right  certificates  had  been  issued  to  10  million  farmers, \nrepresenting 84% of farmers and 75% of farmland. \n12 Overall, the survey found that less than 40% of private SMEs have been able to access bank loans. This is despite \nthe fact that there are about 5 credit lines targeting SMEs, amounting to almost $500 million. The World Bank has \nrecently announced a credit line of more than $300 million, and both the European Union and Japan have credit \nlines totaling about $100 million. ", "    3 \n8.  Limited Access to Financial Resources. SME-oriented credit lines are available in \ncommercial banks, but few alternative financial channels support SMEs. Viet Nam has limited \nfinancial systems for SMEs such as leasing, and start-up and venture capital funds. Leasing is \nan important potential source of finance for SMEs, which lack capital to purchase intermediary \ngoods. Start-up and venture capital funds could also provide a source of financing for SMEs. 13  \n \n9.  Limited  System  for  Capacity  Building.  Despite  many  externally  funded  projects \nrelated to capacity building of SMEs, a coordinated approach to establish a systematic program \nand infrastructure is lacking. As a result, many projects are narrowly focused and short-term \noriented. Viet Nam lacks a state-sponsored institution to support the SMEs\u2019 capacity building \nefforts. For example, SMEs could benefit from institutions to help them meet industrial and \ntechnical standards for both domestic and export markets. 14  \n \n10.  In addition to ADB operations, close coordination among funding agencies is important \nto address the issues surrounding the SMEs. This TA will seek active coordination and attempt \nto ensure complementarities between the initiatives of ADB and other institutions.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to support the preparation of the SDPL by formulating a \nfocused and sustainable framework for SME promotion. The TA and SDPL will be consistent \nwith the broad vision of the Government on SME development, as stated in the Decree 90, \nDirective  No.  17/2002CT-Ttg  (Measures  to  Further  Enhance  the  Implementation  of  the \nEnterprise Law), and The Plans for Enterprise Promotion. The broad agenda identified in these \ndocuments include (i) formulation and implementation of overall SME promotion policies, (ii) \nenhancement of SMEs\u2019 access to finance, (iii) improvement of the current legal/registration \nprocesses, (iv) development of infrastructure for SMEs\u2019 capacity building and export promotion \nefforts, and (v) enhancement of SMEs\u2019 access to land use. The TA will combine policy and legal \nreforms with specific institutional development (based on investment components). The output \nof the TA will include diagnostic analyses and time-bound action plans for the overall design of \nthe SDPL. The TA will have two main components.  \n \n12.  Long-Term Development Plan for Policy and Legal Reforms. The TA will formulate a \ncomprehensive framework for SME promotion, for the medium to long term  (henceforth the \nSME Roadmap).15 After an in-depth diagnostic analysis of the issues, the Roadmap will also \nprovide the overall policy and legal components of the SDPL. Within the overall framework, the \nspecific components to be considered include (i) identifying the policy coordination framework \nand implementation aspects of SME related projects including capacity building and legal status \nof  SME  promotion  institutions;  (ii)  completing  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  SME \npromotion on various issues as stated above (paras. 6-9), including improving market and other \n                                                 \n13 The venture capital industry is just starting in Viet Nam, and it can benefit from the SME-oriented securities trading \ncenter in Hanoi, which is expected to be in operation by the year 2003. Establishment of the center has been \nsupported by ADB. The leasing industry is still relatively small, although it has been growing rapidly. The total \nleased assets for 2001 are estimated to amount to VND2 trillion ($133 million). \n14 High-quality technical standards are potentially important for SMEs? certification signals to the market the quality \nof their products, and thereby enhances their exporting and subcontracting potentials. \n15 The Vice Minister of MPI, in a letter of 5 August 2002 to Director General-MKRD, has requested ADB assistance \nfor the formulation of the SME Roadmap. The MPI has agreed to provide an outline of the SME Roadmap before \nthe implementation of the TA.  ", "4  \nrelated information provision to SMEs; (iii) strengthening the system for capacity building for \nSMEs, including technical centers for enhancing the current industrial and technical standards \nand information on technology transfer for SMEs; and (iv) creating a favorable environment to \nimprove the SMEs\u2019 access to the financial system, including the leasing and venture capital \nindustries. The TA will also analyze the current efforts by the Government on developing major \ndevelopment  finance  components  related  to  SMEs,  including  establishment  of  the  credit \nguarantee fund, and an export-import bank, and enhanced role of the Development Assistance \nFund for SMEs. \n \n13.  Feasibility  Study  on  Development  of  Institutions.  To  complement  the  policy \ncomponents,  the  TA  will  investigate  the  development  of  possible  institutional  (investment) \ncomponents, such as (i) enhancing the development of venture capital and equity funds in Viet \nNam? such  development  is  important  given  the  large  number  of  SMEs  recently  being \nestablished, and that they still rely on informal contacts for financial resources;16 (ii) establishing \na facilitating institution for SME-related projects? although some large-scale credit lines are \navailable to SMEs, none is available for related projects such as capacity building programs, or \nSMEs\u2019 attempts to enhance their access to land; and (iii) developing industrial standards and \ntechnical assistance center, to help SMEs improve their products. These components will be \ninvestigated for their development impact, sustainability, and feasibility based on budget and \npotential demand.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  To address the two major categories of tasks, the TA will comprise two main phases. \nThe first phase will initiate the formulation of the framework for the SDPL, and the second phase \nwill focus on the specific feasibility studies for the targeted investment components. In the first \nphase, the medium-term framework will be developed in close consultation with the Government \ncovering the necessary policy reforms, which will make up the overall policy reform agenda of \nthe  SDPL.  A  preliminary  feasibility  study  will  be  conducted  to  prepare  for  more  in-depth \nanalyses of the second phase on the investment components. To achieve the goals of the first \nphase, the TA will undertake the following tasks: (i) an in-depth diagnostic analysis of the key \nissues facing the SME sector, (ii) a detailed draft of the framework for SME promotion, (iii) \nidentification of the overall framework for the SDPL, and (iv) pre-feasibility analyses of the \ninvestment components. \n \n15.  Based on the achievements of the first phase, both the framework for SME promotion \nand the framework for the SDPL will be refined throughout the second phase, based on active \nconsultation with the Government. The detailed feasibility studies on the specific investment \ncomponents that have been determined in the first phase will be based on the two frameworks. \nAs each step of the TA will require close consultation with stakeholders, several workshops will \nbe organized and other opportunities will be made to build consensus on these outputs for the \nSDPL.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 In this task, ADB will seek close coordination with the Mekong Project Development Facility and Mekong Enterprise \nFund.   ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  a  total  of  $820,000  equivalent,  comprising  a  foreign \nexchange cost of $560,000 equivalent and a local currency cost of $260,000 equivalent. The \nGovernment of Italy will finance $400,000 equivalent and ADB will finance $160,000 equivalent \nto cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $90,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, or \n$650,000 total, on a grant basis. ADB financing will be from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $170,000  equivalent  of  the  local  costs,  including \nprovision of counterpart staff, office space, administrative services and physical facilities. The \ncost estimate and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. Detailed implementation arrangements \nfor  the  two  main  phases  will  be  discussed  with  the  selected  consultants  during  contract \nnegotiations. The contract is based on quality-cost-based selection process and the simplified \ntechnical proposal will be used. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  To facilitate implementation of the TA, ADB has requested that a high-level working \ngroup  be  established  headed  by  the  vice  minister  of  MPI,  the  Executing  Agency.  The \nimplementing agencies include the Ministry of Finance, State Bank of Viet Nam, Ministry of \nScience and Technology, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (General Department \nof Land Management), and other Government agencies. The Government and ADB will allow \nflexibility in the overall design of the TA to address the dynamic issues facing the SME sector. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 6 months from March to September 2003 \nand require three international (14 person-months total) and four domestic (22 person-months \ntotal) consultants. The consultant team will produce an inception report, two interim reports, and \na draft final report, and each will be discussed during tripartite meetings. The consultant team \nwill  be  selected  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Italy; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Viet Nam for preparing the \nSmall- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector Development Program, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nSustainable economic  ??Increased investment by SMEs   The Government\u2019s  ??The Government\u2019s \ndevelopment with a  ??Increased employment in SMEs  statistical reports  commitment to SME \nvibrant small- and  ??Increased SME contribution to    development \nmedium-sized enterprise  gross domestic product    ??Stable political and \n(SME) sector     macroeconomic \n  environment \nPurpose       \nEnhance institutional and  ??The Government\u2019s endorsement  ??The progress of the  ??The Government\u2019s \npolicy framework for SME  of the project preparatory  design of the SDPL  commitment to SME \ndevelopment  technical assistance (TA) and  and framework for  development \n  the SME Development Program  SME promotion  ??Coordination of all \nLoan (2004) (SDPL)  ??ADB review missions  institutions involved in \n??Asian Development Bank (ADB)  ??Government\u2019s plans  private sector and SME \noperations for SME  for SME development   sector development \ndevelopment based on the TA \n??Effective coordination of funding \nagencies based on the TA \nOutputs       \nSpecific and focused  ??Prepare for the SDPL based on  ??TA Progress report   ??Support of related \nassistance modality for  (i) the SME Roadmap, for the  ??ADB review missions  Government agencies \nthe SDPL  long-term development plan for  and consultations with  ??Competence of \n  the SME sector; (ii) the SDPL\u2019s  the Government and  consultants \nspecific policy reform agenda for  other stakeholders  ??Ability of ADB to \nthe medium term; and (iii)    closely communicate \ninstitutional development plans  with relevant actors \nfor the SDPL.  \n??These outputs will be based on \nthe analysis of the SME sector, \nincluding (i) diagnostic review; \n(ii) activities and plans of the \nGovernment and other \nstakeholders; (iii) prioritization of \nthe current needs; and (iv) \nguidelines for ADB operations \nActivities       \nWorkshops and other  ??Hold at least 5 workshops with  ??TA Progress reports   ??Support of related \nconsultations with the  stakeholders to build consensus  ??ADB review missions  Government agencies \nGovernment and other  for both the SDPL and the  and consultations with  ??Competence of \nstakeholders for  framework  the Government and  consultants \nconsensus-building  ??Consultants and ADB missions  other stakeholders  ??Ability of ADB to \n  to engage in close consultation    closely communicate \nwith the Government and others  with relevant actors \nInputs       \nPhase 1: 10 person- ??Framework for both the SDPL  ??TA Progress reports  ??Support of the related \nmonths of international  and the framework and pre- ??ADB review missions  Government agencies \nand domestic consultants  feasibility studies for investment  and consultations with  ??Competence of \n  components  the Government and  consultants \n    other stakeholders  ??Ability of ADB to \nPhase 2: 26 person- ??Fine-tuning of both the SDPL    closely communicate \nmonths of international  and the framework and full  with relevant actors \nand domestic consultants  feasibility studies for investment   \n  components ", "    Appendix 2  7 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.

It \nwill  enhance  the  current  economic  structure,  income,  and  employment-generating  activities;  reduce  income \nfluctuation of individuals and businesses; and thereby contribute to macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction.  \n \nAbout 22 million people are unemployed or underemployed in Viet Nam, and another 1.3 million young people are \nentering the workforce each year. As growth in the state-owned, foreign-invested, and agriculture sectors are \nexpected to slow, the private sector needs to grow by about 150% during the next 5 years to meet the growing \ndemands (Asian Development Bank. 2002. Private Sector Assessment -draft). \n \nTo reach these ambitious goals, and to achieve growth of industrial gross domestic product (GDP) of around 10% per \nyear, the private sector will have to contribute most of the total domestic investment. Based on Asian Development \nBank projections, the domestic private sector will need to double its investment, from the current 7% to 10-13% GDP \nto meet these targets. \n \n \nB. Poverty Analysis          Proposed Classification: Beneficiary Non-Specific \n \nAnalysis:  \n \nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  aims  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  The \nimplementation of the  SME Development Program Loan (2004) will lead to a more balanced and competitive \nindustrial structure,  increased income and employment generating activities,  reduced fluctuation of incomes of \nindividuals and businesses, and export competitiveness. Thus, the loan contributes to macroeconomic stability and \npoverty reduction.  \n \nThe private sector and SMEs have a crucial role in raising the level of investment and are essential for improving the \nquality of investment; i.e., creating new, more productive, and higher paying employment. Private SMEs generate \nmore labor opportunities per unit of capital than large enterprises. SMEs are therefore vital for the country to absorb \nthe more than 1 million (and growing) new entrants into the job market each year, and to stimulate employment-\nintensive growth in rural areas, moving workers out of agriculture. Private sector SMEs are likely to be the main \nsource of investment opportunities, generating economic growth and creating employment. \n \nC.
