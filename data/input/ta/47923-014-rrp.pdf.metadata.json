I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nUS dollar\u2013yuan loan facility of up to $200 million equivalent to China Water Affairs Group \nLimited (CWA) and Shanghai Silver Dragon Investment Limited (SSD), comprising (i) a US \ndollar\u2013yuan A-loan of up to $100 million equivalent, and (ii) a US dollar\u2013yuan complementary \nloan of up to $100 million equivalent for the Urban\u2013Rural Integration Water Distribution Project \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Access  to  safe  and  reliable  water  is  a  basic  human  need  that  remains  unmet  for \nhundreds of millions in the PRC: half of the population (700 million) consume water below World \nHealth Organization standards. Furthermore, a demographic imbalance in water access and \nquality is evident: about 55% of rural residents lack household tap connections, relying instead \non wells and other communal means for supply.1 In those communities, water is often supplied \nbelow  national  quality  standards,  a  consequence  of  inadequate  treatment  or  secondary \ncontamination from pipelines with high leakage during distribution. \n \n3.  Against this backdrop, CWA, a private sector pioneer in urban water distribution, is \nexpanding its strategy to target underserved rural and semi-urban communities. CWA is well \nestablished  in  its  core  business  of  supplying  water  to  cities.  Since  2011,  with  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  assistance,  the  firm  has  implemented  the  Municipal  Water \nDistribution Infrastructure Development Project, which supports the rehabilitation and expansion \nof water distribution networks in second- and third-tier cities.2 To date, the assistance has \nfunded 11 subprojects with aggregate supply capacity of 1.2 million cubic meters (mcm) per \nday. Building on the success of this earlier ADB intervention, CWA requested ADB to consider a \nfollow-on project to finance investments that would reach communities surrounding its existing \nservice areas. CWA also requested ADB\u2019s support for expansion into second- and third-tier \ncities to establish new operations and hubs from which to penetrate surrounding rural areas \nover time. \n \n4.  Despite good progress in expanding water access to its urban residents, the PRC faces \na rural water gap. The challenge is particularly acute for the PRC\u2019s 650 million rural residents\u2014\nof whom more than half lack basic household connections and who bear disproportionately the \nimpact on health and livelihood from scarce, expensive, or substandard water (footnote 1). \nEfforts to establish last-mile connections confront high investment costs, especially in areas with \nlower  population  density.  Even  in  rural  or  semi-urban  communities  which  do  have  tap \nconnections, water is often supplied below national quality standards, caused by pollution at the \nwater  source,  inadequate  treatment,  or  contamination  from  pipelines.  Finally,  waste  and \n                                                \n1  United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization. 2012. Progress on Drinking Water and \nSanitation (2012 Update). New York. \n2  ADB. 2011.

Manila.  ", "2 \ninefficiency are higher in rural and semi-urban areas than in any other part of the water chain, \nwith nonrevenue water rates typically above the PRC\u2019s national average of 20%\u201330%.3  \n \n5.  Closing the rural water gap is an increasing priority for the government. In 2012, it \nannounced a program of rural water investments of CNY170 billion during the 12th Five-Year \nPlan (2011\u20132015)\u2014or CNY100 billion more than was allocated in 2006\u20132010.4 The program \nwould prioritize the construction and rehabilitation of piped water systems in rural and semi-\nurban areas, including the extension of urban water supply networks. The program is part of the \ngovernment\u2019s  urban\u2013rural  integration  initiative  aimed  to  rectify  development  imbalances \nbetween city and countryside through provision of basic infrastructure services. \n \n6.  Water  distribution  in  the  PRC  has  traditionally  been  the  responsibility  of  municipal \ngovernment. Utilities owned by municipalities typically suffer from chronic financial distress due \nto weak management, poor budgetary discipline, artificially low water tariffs, and the widespread \nproblem of nonrevenue water. Meanwhile, utility financial losses are a burden on many local \ngovernment  budgets,  and  contribute  to  patterns  of  underinvestment  in  tap  networks.  In \nresponse, the central government has since 1998 progressively encouraged commercialization \nof  water  distribution  and  increased  private  sector  participation  as  a  means  to  increase \ninvestment and efficiency.5  \n \n2.  Project Design \n7.  ADB\u2019s assistance would finance CWA\u2019s plan to invest in (i) expanding existing water \nutility networks into adjacent semi-urban and rural communities; and (ii) establishing, through \nconstruction or acquisition, new water treatment and distribution hubs in second- and third-tier \ncities  that  have  the  potential  for  urban\u2013rural  integration.  ADB  will  extend  financing  on  a \nsubproject-by-subproject basis, subject to a set of defined environmental, social, development, \nand financial criteria. \n \n8.  The project is designed to be cost-effective in financing smaller-scale water supply \nprojects. The portfolio approach will enable ADB to support multiple water supply projects of a \nscale usually too small and expensive for ADB or international banks to finance on a stand-\nalone basis.  \n \n9.  The project differs from ADB\u2019s earlier assistance to CWA by more strongly emphasizing \ninclusiveness. By leveraging the company\u2019s existing water supply projects (as bases from which \nto expand), the project can target rural and semi-urban communities, typically of lower incomes, \n                                                \n3  \u201cNonrevenue water\u201d refers to water that is economically lost due to leaking pipelines, inadequate control equipment \nor meters (either faulty or never installed), or lack of payment collection. \n4  The investment program is an interministerial effort of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), \nthe Ministry of Water Resources, the National Health and Family Planning Commission, and the Ministry of \nEnvironmental Protection (MEP). Supporting policy guidance is also given by the Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013\nRural Development (MOHURD) and NDRC. 2012.

The Sponsor and the Borrowers \n10.  The project will have two borrowers: (i) CWA, the sponsor and borrower representative, \nwill be borrower for US dollar and offshore yuan tranches; and (ii) SSD will be an onshore yuan \nborrower. \n \n11.  CWA is a rapidly emerging player in the PRC water supply industry. Since its founding in \n2003, the company has pioneered a successful model of acquiring municipal utilities (either in \npartnership with local governments or through full privatization), overhauling infrastructure and \nmanagement systems, and efficiently distributing water to households and industries. With a \nstrategic  focus  on  smaller  cities  and  towns  in  interior  provinces,  CWA  operates  nearly \n30 concessions with total treatment and distribution capacity of about 4.5 mcm of water per day. \nAbout 85% of CWA\u2019s revenues come from water supply, with the remainder from sewage \ntreatment,  water-related  construction  services,  and  other  ancillary  businesses.  CWA  is \nincorporated in Bermuda and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.9 For the year to 30 \nMarch 2013, the company reported consolidated revenues of HK$2.25 billion; earnings before \ninterest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of HK$703 million; and total assets of HK$11.6 \nbillion. Its performance under 2 years of ADB assistance has been in line with expectations at \nthe time of Board approval, with stable growth, strong management, and financial ratios well \nwithin the covenants of the ADB loan agreement.10 \n \n12.  SSD is an investment holding company wholly owned by CWA for investments in water-\nrelated businesses. Among SSD\u2019s operating subsidiaries are five water distribution companies \nand several ancillary businesses.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n                                                \n6  CWA\u2019s rural and semi-urban investments would target areas under the administrative jurisdiction of adjacent \nmunicipalities, and thus would be subject to the PRC\u2019s standard regulations for municipal water supply. \n7  Under the project, costs of connecting new household taps will be borne by a combination of user fees, cross-\nsubsidization (across user groups and between urban center and rural periphery), and local government assistance \nthrough grants and subsidized lifeline tariffs. \n8  Integration of smaller stand-alone networks into larger utility systems typically increases economies of scale. Due \ndiligence confirmed that, in most locations, newly integrated rural customers will see decreases in water tariffs. \nFurther, for consumers without pre-existing tap connections, tap supply is significantly cheaper than bottled water.  \n9  Bermuda is on the list of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard. \nThe Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes has determined, following its \nphase 1 peer review of Bermuda, that the country has in place all the elements assessed to date in relation to the \ninternationally agreed tax standard. (September 2013. OECD Progress Report to the G20 Leaders: Global Forum \nUpdate on Effectiveness and On-going Monitoring. Paris).  Following ADB\u2019s review of CWA, ADB does not believe \nthat CWA has been established or is being used, for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or the financing \nof terrorism. \n10 FY2013 consolidated revenues projected in the report and recommendation of the President were HK$2.7 billion \n(versus actual revenues of HK$2.3 billion); projected net income was HK$0.95 billion (vs. HK$0.9 billion); and \nprojected assets were HK$11.5 billion (vs. HK$11.6 billion). The company is significantly less indebted (HK$2.5 \nbillion) than was forecast (HK$4.1 billion). ", "4 \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n13.  Impact. The anticipated project impacts will be (i) expanded access to safe and reliable \nwater supply for rural and urban households and other customers in the PRC; (ii) improved \nwater  efficiency;  and  (iii)  increased  private  sector  participation  in  rural  and  urban  network \ninvestment and operation.  \n \n14.  Outcome. The outcome will be improved water services in rural, semi-urban, and small-\ntown areas of the PRC provided through private sector participation, as measured by improved \nor new water connections for rural and urban residents, demand for local goods and services, \nand  contribution  to  PRC  government  revenue,  improvements  in  water  efficiency,  and \nachievement of national water quality standards. About 0.7 million households will be given \nreliable and convenient access to safe drinking water through the ADB-financed subprojects. \nThe beneficiaries include the poor, who disproportionately bear the health and livelihood costs \nassociated with substandard or insufficient water supply. \n \n15.  Output. The output will be the rehabilitation and operation of water treatment plants and \ndistribution at designed performance levels of up to 2 mcm per day of water supply capacity. \nThe facilities will comply with national standards for safe drinking water quality and with ADB \nsafeguards, and technical and financial eligibility criteria.11 \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n16.  Consistency with Strategy 2020. The project is consistent with Strategy 2020, which \nemphasizes  support  for  achieving  poverty  reduction  through  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable growth, including private sector development as a driver of change.12 The strategy \nlists infrastructure and the environment as two of the five core areas in which ADB will employ \nits financial and institutional resources to maximize results, efficiency, and impact. In terms of \ninfrastructure, the project is in line with Strategy 2020\u2019s emphasis on public\u2013private partnerships \nand private sector engagement; and consistent with plans to improve human health through \ninterventions  in  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management.  With  regard  to  the \nenvironment, ADB will assist developing member countries and their municipalities in managing \na range of problems resulting from rapid urbanization. \n \n17.  Consistency with country strategy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC is \nbased on three development pillars: (i) inclusive growth and balanced development, (ii) resource \nefficiency and environmental sustainability, and (iii) regional cooperation and public goods.13 \nThe project reinforces each pillar and will be an integral part of ADB\u2019s overall support for rural\u2013\nurban development in the PRC. It strongly complements current ADB initiatives in the water \nsector.14 It is also consistent with the strategy\u2019s support for private sector development as a \ndriver of change.  \n                                                \n11 The quality of treatment plant output is tested by CWA, and enforced through regular inspections by MEP, \nMOHURD, and the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC). The water quality in households is \ntested by MOHURD and NHFPC on a spot basis. \n12 ADB. 2008.

The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Water Policy,  which emphasizes integrated water management, water conservation, and \nsystem efficiencies.15 The Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 also lists improved efficiency and \nprivate  sector  participation  as  priority  areas.16 The  project  is  an  example  of  the  type  of \nintervention envisaged by the plan, which promotes water as a core investment area and raises \nADB\u2019s water investment target to $2.0 billion\u2013$2.5 billion annually, or a total of $20 billion\u2013\n$25 billion by 2020. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n19.  CWA\u2019s business plan for FY2014\u2013FY2017 indicates a total investment requirement of \n$400  million  equivalent  and  includes  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  other  local \nprocurement, and working capital.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE.

For all subprojects, a feasibility study, \nenvironmental assessment, resettlement plan, and project design will be prepared by \nCWA, reviewed by ADB, and approved by municipal governments. Each subproject will be \nimplemented in accordance with granted approvals, and during construction and operation \nwill be subject to government inspections on various aspects, including environment, health \nand safety, land acquisition and resettlement, impacts on ethnic minorities, labor, and \nsanitation.  \nTariff framework  Tariffs are governed by PRC cost-plus regulations and administered by municipal pricing \nauthorities with public consultation.b \nManagement  CWA  will  centrally  control  all  subproject  development  and  financing  arrangements. \nProcurement (e.g., third-party construction contracts through competitive selection) of all \ncivil works and equipment will be handled by CWA according to PRC local bidding \nprocedures.  \nSubproject selection  To  be  eligible  for  ADB  funding,  subprojects  must  meet  defined  criteria  for  location, \ninvestment  purpose,  environmental  and  social  risk  mitigation,  water  efficiency \nimprovement, and forecast financial return.  \nImplementation period  2014\u20132017 \nOperation arrangements \nOperation and  CWA will manage project implementation, operation, and maintenance as part of its 25\u201330- \nmaintenance  year subproject concession obligations.  \n                                                                                                                                                       \nthe President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Harbin Water \nSupply Project.

This contractual arrangement is in line with the PRC\u2019s urban\u2013rural \nintegration policies, which require the municipality to be also in charge of surrounding villages and communities. \nb  End-use tariffs are set by each municipal government on a cost-plus basis to target a benchmark return on equity \nof 8%\u201312% in accordance with national regulations (Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development; National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission. 1998.

If  operating  costs  from  electricity,  labor,  upgrades, \nmaintenance, or other inputs rise, a utility operator is entitled to apply for a corresponding tariff increase to meet the \nbenchmark return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n21.  The project is financially viable as CWA\u2019s expected financial internal rate of return is \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital, and economically viable as the economic \nreturn on invested capital is higher than the social discount rate of 12%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n22.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance consists of (i) a US dollar-yuan A-loan of up to $100 million \nequivalent, and (ii) a US dollar-yuan complementary loan of up to $100 million equivalent \nfunded by participating banks with ADB acting as lender of record. The proposed A-loan will \nhave a maturity of up to 10 years from the date of the first disbursement, including a 4-year \ngrace period on principal repayment. The complementary loan will have a maturity equal to or \nshorter than that of the A-loan. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  Catalyzing  private  investment  in  less-developed  areas.  Water  distribution \ninfrastructure requires significant upfront capital, with a particular need for loans under tenors \nappropriate for long-lived assets. In the water distribution business\u2014especially in smaller urban \nor rural areas\u2014such financing is difficult to obtain from commercial banks because of risk \nconcerns and bank inexperience in the sector. The project will help a proven player surmount \nthese obstacles, while expanding private investment in less-developed areas where broader \nparticipation is urgently required. \n \n24.  Developing viable commercial models of water provision. The project builds on the \nsuccess of ADB\u2019s earlier assistance to CWA, which focused on urban centers, by supporting the \ncompany in the relatively untested area of rural utility service provision. Through a portfolio \nfinancing approach, ADB will support the development of multiple water supply subprojects that \nare typically too small and expensive for ADB or international banks to finance on a stand-alone \nbasis. Finally, ADB\u2019s experience with the project can contribute meaningfully to the dialogue on \nrural\u2013urban integration and water sector development in the PRC and the rest of Asia and the \nPacific.

Mitigation measures include (i) PRC policies, developed \nunder long-standing ADB technical assistance, to mandate that urban water tariffs provide cost \nrecovery  and  adequate  returns;  (ii)  strong  government  policy  pressure  to  raise  tariffs  to \nrationalize water use and prevent waste; (iii) the relatively low starting point of current urban \nwater tariffs, which gives significant room to raise tariffs within affordability thresholds; and \n(iv) CWA  consideration  of  local  government  tariff  plans  in  its  selection  and  negotiation  of \nsubproject investments. \n \n26.  Risk of nonpayment. Possible nonpayment by end users\u2014residential, commercial, or \nindustrial\u2014would directly affect cash flow. This risk is mitigated by (i) the installation of meters \n(one per customer) in line with national policy and CWA\u2019s business strategy; (ii) the legal right of \nPRC  water  utilities  to  deny  service  for  nonpaying  customers;  and  (iii)  the  reliance  of  city \ngovernments on ancillary fees collected from water customers by the subproject companies, \nthereby aligning local authorities with CWA in pursuing prompt collections. Due to these factors, \nCWA reports tariff collection rates of over 98%.  \n \n27.  Demand  risk.  Revenue  risk  may  arise  from  unexpectedly  low  demand  for  water \nservices,  affecting  either  CWA\u2019s  distribution  operations  or  related  investments  in treatment \nplants. This risk is mitigated by (i) the large latent demand for water among rural and urban \nresidential,  commercial,  and  industrial  customers;  and  (ii)  CWA\u2019s  practice  of  selecting  its \nsubprojects in part based on demand potential. \n \n28.  Water  supply  risk. Water  supply  risk  may  arise  from  contamination,  depletion,  or \ndrought. This risk is mitigated by (i) CWA\u2019s practice of selecting subprojects with proven water \navailability and quality, with a focus on water-rich central and southern provinces; (ii) water \nsupply agreements with provincial or municipal governments, which will give the subproject \ncompanies the legal right to predetermined volumes of water at specified quality and enables \nthe  subproject  company  (subject  to  certain  conditions  being  fulfilled)    to  terminate  the \nagreements in case of significant deterioration in water quality; and (iii) standardized sales \nagreements with industrial and commercial end users, which will include provisions freeing the \nsubproject companies from liability or obligation when upstream water supply is suspended by \ncircumstances beyond their control. \n \n29.  Expansion. The project will support CWA\u2019s plans to operate up to 6.5 mcm per day of \nadditional water supply capacity, a significant expansion on its current operational capacity of \n4.5 mcm per day. Such expansion requires strong management skills to overcome execution \nrisk and the expected increase in CWA\u2019s gearing. Mitigating measures include CWA\u2019s overall \ntechnical  competence,  its  use  of  standardized  management  systems  across  its  subproject \ncompanies,  its  use  of  shared  technical  resources  at  several  operational  hubs,  and  the \nbrownfield  (i.e.,  already  operating)  nature  of the  subprojects.  Further,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is \nconditional on the subprojects meeting eligibility criteria and financial covenants, helping ensure \nsubproject viability. \n \n30.  Acquisition  valuation.  Subproject  acquisitions  involve  valuation  of  local  utility \ncompanies. With its successful track record, CWA has established a methodology to effectively \nvalue  the  pipeline  networks,  related  infrastructure,  and  land  owned  by  the  local  utility \ncompanies.  To  verify  its  assessments,  CWA  uses  independent  valuations  from  third-party ", "8 \nauditors. Further, PRC policies mandate that water tariffs provide cost recovery and adequate \nreturns taking into account the value of utility assets. \n \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions  \n31.  Safeguards. The project is being processed as corporate finance, with ADB funds to be \nallocated for implementing specific subprojects. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) requirements for corporate finance projects, safeguard requirements 1\u20133 will apply, and \nan environmental and social management system (ESMS) will be maintained.18 The project is \nclassified  as  category B for  impacts  on  the  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement  and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. The environmental impacts are not significant and are \nmostly construction-related; they can be mitigated through the adoption of good engineering \npractices. Resettlement impacts are not expected to be significant as (i) rehabilitation of water \ntreatment plants and distribution networks will be within the existing facilities or within the \navailable road reserves; (ii) for new facilities, the municipal governments normally complete land \nacquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation (if needed) prior to handing over the sites to CWA; \nand (iii) expansion of distribution networks in unserved areas will be within the available road \nreserves. Impacts on indigenous peoples are not anticipated as the plants are typically located \nin areas where the population is primarily Han. The potential environmental and social impacts \nof the project have been defined in the ESMS and effective measures to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts  of every subproject financed under the \nproject will be incorporated in the initial environmental examination and resettlement plan for \neach subproject.  \n \n32.  A corporate audit was conducted on CWA\u2019s ESMS and its past and current performance \nagainst the objectives, principles, and requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement. The \naudit  confirmed that  (i)  CWA\u2019s  ESMS  has  been  developed  to  comply  with  the  objectives, \nprinciples, and requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement; (ii) no substantive revisions are \nrequired to the existing ESMS to mitigate impacts resulting from the proposed project; and, \n(iii) there are no existing or legacy issues relating to the audited facilities. The audit highlighted \nthe need for a more stringent application of the ESMS provisions in the audited facilities, \nespecially in documentation and reporting of the implementation of environmental and social \nmanagement measures. In line with the findings of the audit and the corrective action plan, \nCWA commits to revise and update its corporate ESMS prior to the first ADB disbursement. \nSubprojects  where  land  was  acquired  prior  to  handing  over  the  concession  to  CWA  and \nsubprojects with operational facilities will be subject to audit following the updated ESMS.19  \n \n33.  Other social dimensions. The project is classified as having some gender elements. In \naddition to the direct benefit of improving households\u2019 access to potable water, especially \nwomen's, CWA will work toward incorporating the following measures: (i) carry out meaningful \nconsultations  that  are  gender  inclusive  and  responsive,  (ii)  involve  women  in  awareness \n                                                \n18 CWA, as part of the ongoing Municipal Water Distribution Infrastructure Development Project, established in 2011 \nits ESMS to screen, assess, and mitigate environmental and social impacts (footnote 2). \n19 Findings of the Corporate Safeguards Audit and Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \ngeneration  activities,  training  programs  on  water  conservation,  and  water  user  awareness \ncampaigns, and (iii) prioritize hiring of women for jobs created. CWA will employ local residents \nduring construction and operation of the facilities. CWA and its contractors will comply with the \nnational labor laws and take measures to comply with the international core labor standards in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.20 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n34.  CWA and SSD were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n35.  The proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n36.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 21  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to \nCWA and SSD will be obtained. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of \nDirectors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the US dollar\u2013\nyuan loan facility of up to $200,000,000 equivalent to China Water Affairs Group Limited and \nShanghai Silver Dragon Investment Limited for the Urban\u2013Rural Integration Water Distribution \nProject in the People\u2019s Republic of China, comprising \n(i)  a US dollar\u2013yuan A-loan of up to $100,000,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources; and \n(ii)  a US dollar\u2013yuan complementary loan of up to $100,000,000 equivalent to be \nfunded by participating banks, \nwith such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n11 November 2013  \n                                                \n20  ADB. 2003.
