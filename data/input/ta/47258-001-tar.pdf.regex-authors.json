The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India are seeking to identify opportunities \nand related technical, financial, and policy requirements to create low-carbon economic growth \npathways.  The  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  has  for  the  first  time  set  a  carbon-intensity \nreduction target of 17% and intends to achieve it by 2015.1  India\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan has \nalso recognized the need for low-carbon development strategies to ensure inclusive growth.2 \nWhile some detailed studies on low carbon development for energy, industrial and other sectors \nhave been undertaken nationally, there are few collaborative studies comparing the experiences \ngained in the two countries, particularly at a subnational scale. Bilateral official interactions \nbetween the PRC and India have revealed an interest by the two countries in collaborating on \nthese topics.  \n \n2.  In 2012, PRC and India jointly launched an initial research project about low-carbon \ndevelopment strategies, funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The \nobjective of the UNDP research project was to inform short- to long-term decision making in the \nPRC and India on enhancing low-carbon development strategies. The UNDP project sought to \nbring together policy and practice communities on a single knowledge platform. \n \n3.  UNDP provided seed funding to the research project and has called for partnerships to \nfurther advance low-carbon development in both countries because it is currently unable to fund \nor oversee additional research on this topic.  In early 2013, the governments of PRC and India \nendorsed  further  studies  on  low-carbon  development,  seeking  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  They  specified  seven  focus  areas  for  potential  studies:  power, \nindustry, transport, buildings, agriculture, forestry, and waste.  \n \n4.  After stakeholder consultations in the PRC and India, three of the seven focus areas\u2014 \nenergy, buildings, and transport\u2014will be considered for inclusion in this proposed regional \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA), which focuses on the development of a low-\ncarbon development study. ADB\u2019s vice-president for knowledge management and sustainable \ndevelopment approved the TA concept paper on 8 November 2013.3 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  To mitigate the impacts of climate change, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must be \nsignificantly reduced in the coming decades. It will be necessary for emerging economies to \nshift toward low-carbon development; this is particularly true of the PRC and India, which \ntogether account for about 37% of the world\u2019s population, 12% of the world\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct, and about 32% of the world\u2019s GHG emissions. Both the PRC and India are intent on \nfinding opportunities to create green growth, and to deploy technical, financial, and policy tools \nto achieve sustainable development. \n \n6.  The  development  approaches  and  experiences  of  the  PRC  and  India  reflect  clear \ndifferences in their policies, systems, and socioeconomic circumstances. Nevertheless, the \nchallenges facing these two countries in shifting toward low-carbon development are similar and \nstern. In both countries, technology innovations are unevenly disseminated geographically and \n                                                 \n1 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2012.

Both countries urgently need a better understanding of how to promote innovation, \ncommercialize new technology, and scale up technology deployment in the context of low-\ncarbon  development,  enabling  them  to  adjust  strategies  and  build  capacities  in  science, \ntechnology and innovation, as well as basic technical skills.  \n \n7.  Financing remains a key factor in the scaling up of low-carbon technologies. In both \ncountries, public funding is insufficient and this will get worse as government funding for social \nservices increases and consumption levels grow. In-depth studies are required to examine the \npolicy and regulatory environment, key financial institutions relevant to low-carbon development, \nand models of reforms for both public and private financing systems to better manage public \nfunds and create necessary incentives for driving private sector capital away from high-carbon \ninvestment and into low-carbon assets.  \n \n8.  Given  that  subnational  planning  and  implementation  are  vital  for  low-carbon \ndevelopment, and there are many examples of bottom-up decentralized efforts, case studies \ndemonstrating integrated policies, programs, and innovative solutions would be very useful for \ngenerating  knowledge  and  developing  good  models  for  technology  innovation  and \ndissemination, financing, and market creation. The proposed study will fill this information gap.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be increased cooperation between the PRC and India, leading to the \nestablishment of low-carbon development paths for selected focus areas in both countries. The \noutcome will be greater knowledge and better understanding by policymakers of low-carbon \ndevelopment experiences in the PRC and India. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Outputs relate to a series of substantive studies to be completed for the PRC and India, \nas well as a synthesis. The TA will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of \n(i) conducting analytical overviews and in-depth studies in three areas of critical interest to the \nPRC and India,4 which will examine the key factors contributing to or discouraging low-carbon \nfinance, technology, and innovation (two or three subnational case studies will be conducted for \neach selected sector); and (ii) drawing lessons from the in-depth studies for future policy and \nprogram  development.  Phase  2  will  focus  on  publishing  and  disseminating  the  knowledge \nproducts and synthesis completed in phase 1. \n \n11.  Output 1: Nexus of low-carbon development and energy examined in the PRC and \nIndia. Output 1 involves the following:   \n \n  (i)  Low-carbon energy study: PRC. This study will  \n(a)  examine  the  policy  framework  to  promote  more  carbon  capture  and \nstorage initiatives, integrated gasification combined-cycle technologies, \nand waste-to-energy technologies, and to \u2018reduce, reuse, and recycle\u2019 \n                                                 \n4  Studies for both countries are mostly equivalent in scope, but slight differences result from a few single-country \ninterests that emerged at a consultation workshop held in Beijing in August 2013; they are reflected in the \ndescriptions of expected outputs. \n ", "  3\nactivities,  with  particular  regard  to  private  sector  involvement  in  such \ninitiatives; \n(b)  discuss  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  to  support \ndevelopment and commercialization of second-generation biofuels; and \n(c)  analyze and recommend ways to improve energy pricing, including level \nof subsidies, target groups, and subsidy administration mechanisms.  \n \n(ii)  Low-carbon energy study: India. The study will  \n(a)  identify barriers to greater application of cleaner fossil fuel (supercritical, \nultra  supercritical,  and  integrated  gasification  combined-cycle) \ntechnologies,  as  well  as  waste-to-energy  technologies  in  power \ngeneration, and recommend ways to overcome these barriers; \n(b)  define technical, economic, and regulatory challenges in implementing \ncarbon capture and storage in the power sector, with recommendations \non how to overcome such challenges; \n(c)  examine  the  nexus  of  low-carbon  development  and  energy,  with  a \nparticular focus on emerging areas such as the carbon trade market; and \n(d)  prepare case studies to highlight good practices and lessons. \n \n12.  Output 2: Building, appliance, and equipment standards assessed in the PRC and \nIndia for improved energy efficiency. Output 2 involves the following: \n \n(i)   Low-carbon building study: PRC. The study will  \n(a)  analyze  barriers  and  challenges  in  scaling  up  energy  efficiency \ninvestments in both new and older buildings;  \n(b)  assess and recommend ways to lower the barriers to energy efficiency \ninvestment in buildings; \n(c)  assess and recommend ways to harmonize energy efficiency standards \nand building energy codes across PRC provinces to improve enforcement \nand implementation; and \n(d)  prepare case studies to highlight good practices and lessons. \n   \n(ii)  Low-carbon building study: India. The study will  \n(a)  analyze and recommend ways to improve enforcement of building energy \ncodes, equipment and appliance standards, and labeling programs; \n(b)  assess the policy, regulatory, and financial environment to promote and \nsupport energy service companies; \n(c)  analyze  energy  efficiency  investment  opportunities  in  new  and  older \nbuildings, and make recommendations on how to turn them into tangible \ninvestments; and \n(d)  prepare case studies to highlight good practices and lessons. \n \n13.  Output 3:  Low-carbon development strategies for the transport sector analyzed in \nboth the PRC and India. This involves a low-carbon transport study for both countries (with \nequivalent scope), which will \n(a)  prepare representative policy and project case studies to highlight best \npractices  and  lessons  (e.g.,  sustainable  urban  transport  such  as \nnonmotorized transport, bus rapid transit, high-speed rail); \n(b)  identify  policies,  programs,  and  projects  that  may  be  scaled  up  and \nreplicated; point to barriers and recommend how to overcome them; \n ", "4  \n(c)  assess  policy  and  financial  mechanisms,  including  public\u2013private \npartnerships, instruments such as taxes, charges, and subsidies, as well \nas  fuel  and  vehicle  performance  standards  and  other  regulatory \ninstruments; and \n(d)  compile,  analyze,  and  describe  approaches  to  climate-proofing  low-\ncarbon transportation infrastructure and to managing social dimensions of \ntransport (e.g., accessibility, gender, poverty alleviation). \n \n14.  Output 4: Findings and recommendations synthesized and summarized for low-\ncarbon development strategies in the energy, transport, and building focus areas in the \nPRC and India. This involves a consolidated analytical report on low-carbon development (in all \nsectors selected for the PRC and India), which will  \n(a)  identify good practices and lessons and recommend how to use them to \nimprove low-carbon technology applications in both countries considering \npolicy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks;  technical  capacity; \nresource availability; and financing of innovative arrangements; \n(b)  assess co-benefits (including environmental and social benefits such as \nreduced GHG emissions, local air pollution, noise, and associated health \nimpacts); \n(c)  assess and recommend how to improve and increase information and \ntechnology cooperation; \n(d)  analyze constraints on implementation of policies and strategies for low-\ncarbon  energy,  transport,  and  buildings;  and  recommend  ways  to \novercome these constraints; \n(e)  document experiences and lessons from establishing markets for tradable \nrenewable-energy certificates; and  \n(f)  prepare case studies to highlight good practices and lessons. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented by the \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department,  in  close  coordination  with  East  Asia \nDepartment and South Asia Department, and ADB\u2019s energy, urban, and transport communities \nof practice (CoPs). Partnership with centers of excellence on low carbon development will be \nexplored.5   \n \n17.  The TA will require 29 person-months of international and 36 person-months of national \nconsulting services. For the PRC studies, the consulting team will comprise 12\u201324 individual \ninternational  and  national  consultants  whose  expertise  will  cover  low-carbon  policy  and \nregulation,  finance,  and  technology  across  the  three  study  focus  areas.  An  administrative \ncoordinator for the PRC study will also be engaged. For the India studies, the government has \nsuggested that the work be undertaken by leading research institutes for easier coordination \nand  collaboration.  Consulting  firms  will  therefore  be  engaged,  using  the  consultants\u2019 \n                                                 \n5 These centers of excellence may include Tsinghua University 3E Institute and The Energy and Resources Institute.  \n ", "  5\nqualifications selection method because the assignment is relatively short-term and requires in-\ndepth, specialized expertise in low-carbon development policy and practice in selected sectors. \nConsulting firms will appoint teams of similar size and composition to the PRC team to deliver \nthe  India  study  program.  Lastly,  ADB  will  engage  international  individual  consultants  to \ncoordinate all study outputs and prepare synthesis reports and publications. More details on the \nstructure of the proposed team and the outline terms of reference for all consultants are in \nAppendix 3. ADB will engage all consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).   \n \n18.  Two to three workshops will be held during TA implementation: (i) a small, tripartite \ninception workshop may be needed to determine the detailed scope of each sector study, \nincluding detailed terms of reference for consultants, agreement on the procedures for reviewing \nthe progress of studies, quality control, and other administrative arrangements; (ii) a midterm \nworkshop; and (iii) a final workshop for review, consultation, and knowledge sharing purposes.  \n \n19.  A steering committee, comprising ADB staff and two members each from the PRC\u2019s \nNational Development and Reform Committee and India\u2019s Department of Economic Affairs of \nthe Ministry of Finance will provide guidance and exercise overall oversight. The TA will be \nmonitored also through peer review by the East Asia Department, South Asia Department, and \nby the Energy CoP, Urban CoP, and Transport CoP. Knowledge generation and management is \na  focus  of  the  TA.  Study  results  will  be  published  and  disseminated  through  workshops, \nconferences, and websites of the governments, participating research institutions, and ADB. \n \n20.  The  estimated  period  of  TA  implementation  is  24  months,  from  January  2014  to \nDecember 2015.  This includes about 18 months of research activities (phase 1) and 6 months \nof final publications and dissemination (phase 2).  All disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nIV.
