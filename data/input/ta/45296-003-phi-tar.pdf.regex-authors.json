INTRODUCTION \n1.  To address worsening urban transport problems, the Government of the Philippines has \ndeveloped its National Environmentally Sustainable Transport Strategy, which includes Davao \nas one of the focus cities.1 Extensive consultation has occurred between the government and \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the ADB-supported Promoting Sustainable Urban \nTransport in Asia Project, which included Davao as one of the three case study cities.2 The \nstudy of Davao, completed in July 2011, recommended addressing the urgent requirement to \nmodernize the city\u2019s public transport system and operations. In line with this recommendation, \nADB fielded a reconnaissance mission to Davao on 12\u201313 July 2012 to discuss with government \nofficials  urban  transport  issues  and  reach  agreement  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for the Davao Sustainable Urban Transport Project. The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132014 country operations business plan for the Philippines.3 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Strong economic growth has generated rapidly growing demand for travel within urban \ncenters such as Davao. Worsening congestion, higher travel times and costs, deteriorating local \nair quality, and a failing road safety record are all symptoms of a transport system under \npressure. Sustainable urban transport systems have modern, efficient, and affordable public \ntransport services  at their  core.  Public  transport  is the main  mode  of  transport  in  Davao, \naccounting for 80% of trips. The public transport system has tricycles primarily for short trips \nand jeepneys, or multi-cab vehicles5 for longer distances within the city. Regulations governing \nDavao\u2019s public transport system are outdated, the city lacks an effective transport masterplan, \nand institutions responsible for managing urban transport presently do not coordinate their \nplanning and enforcement. Current public transport routes, the coverage area, connectivity, and \nthe frequency of service are poorly planned and fail to provide satisfactory service. \n \n3.  Davao urgently needs to modernize its public transport operations so that they can serve \nas the backbone of the transport area for the greater metropolitan area. Modernizing Davao\u2019s \npublic transport system will alleviate congestion and reduce high travel costs. A prerequisite for \nfuture urban transport improvements in the city over the medium- to long-term is to provide \npolicy and advisory support to rationalize public transport routing and franchising mechanisms, \ntoward ensuring that services meet demand for travel across the city. \n \n4.  The government recognizes that upgrading and improving the operational efficiency of \nthe public transport system in Davao is an urgent priority to ensure the continued economic \nvitality of the city and support inclusive development for all its citizens. Public transport is the \nmode of transport for the poor and others without access to private vehicles. These are, thus, \ncaptive users. The government understands that reforms to policy, institutions, governance, and \n                                                \n1  As per Presidential Administration Order No. 254, the National Environmentally Sustainable Transport Strategy \nwas launched on 20 May 2011 by the Department of Transportation and Communications and the Department of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources. \n2  ADB. 2009.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The policy and advisory TA will help the government to create an enabling environment \nfor a modern, efficient, and affordable public transport system in Davao that can then be \npresented for demonstration and replication across the Philippines. The TA will prepare plans \nand franchising mechanisms to improve the integration of the public transport system, widen the \ncoverage area, and deliver more efficient transport services to passengers in Davao. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The TA  has four  outputs: (i) the  development  of  a  comprehensive  public  transport \nstrategy for Davao, (ii) the development of a public transport reform program, (iii) a capacity \ndevelopment, and (iv) stakeholder consultation program. \n \n7.  Key activities will include assessing the current status of public transport in Davao. \nCurrent public transport service provision will be analyzed in terms of coverage area, fare \nstructures, daily operating hours, vehicle fleets, and users\u2019 perception of services. From this \nbackground assessment, a strategic policy document will be prepared that will outline the key \nperformance  indicators  (KPIs)  for  an  integrated,  modern,  efficient,  and  affordable  public \ntransport system. The policy document will be supported by a detailed reform program and \nimplementation plans for revising and modernizing the public transport system\u2019s coverage area \nand  route  network,  amending  franchising  mechanisms  and  bidding  procedures,  assessing \nnetwork coverage, and developing an expansion program. The work will generate guidelines \ntoward integrating fares and providing through-ticketing for trips requiring transfers. The TA will \nhave a substantial capacity development component to train government officials and public \ntransport  owners  and  operators.  A  number  of  community  outreach  events  will  ensure  the \nbroadest possible stakeholder participation in developing the city transport system. Outreach \nmeetings  will  ensure  that  all  affected  social  groups,  government  officials,  public  transport \nowners and operators, and passengers are able to contribute to the discussion of the issues \nand proposed changes to improve services. This approach has proven to be a vitally important \naspect of public transport improvement; all stakeholders must take part in decision-making to \nensure  that  suitable  and  sustainable  solutions  are  developed  and  implemented  and  are \nacceptable to end users. \n \n8.  The development of the comprehensive public transport strategy will include a thorough \nreview of city development plans, including the urban masterplan and any transport plans for the \ncity.6 The review will include analyses of the policy, legal, and regulatory framework governing \npublic transport operations and franchising mechanisms, as well as a review of current public \ntransport operations, including the coverage area, route network, fare structure and collection \nmechanisms, and the organizational structures of service providers. Public transport service \nproviders\u2019  organizations  and  structures  will  be  assessed,  along  with  information  on  their \nrespective  revenues,  operating  costs,  assets,  budgets,  and  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement  systems  and  practices,  to  fully  understand  the  financial  performance  of  the \nsubsector.  Existing  and  proposed  public  transport  facilities  will  be  inventoried,  including \n                                                \n6  City Government of Davao. 2010. Metro Davao Urban Transport Study. Davao. \n ", "  3 \nterminals and bus stops. Key external and internal stakeholders for public transport will be \nidentified and their roles analyzed. The information will be used to prepare a comprehensive \npublic transport strategy that defines KPIs for service provision. \n \n9.  The public transport reform program will formulate a policy document governing public \ntransport operations and their coverage area. It will define public transport system operations \nand specifications, prepare a route network and service provision plan, and develop public \ntransport franchising mechanisms and a bidding process. System integration mechanisms and \npolicy  guidelines  will  be  prepared  for  the  subsector  with  linked  monitoring,  policing,  and \nenforcement guidelines. \n \n10.  The capacity development component will (i) prepare a training program for government \nofficials and public transport owners and operators on public transport route planning and \nfranchising  mechanisms,  (ii)  develop  training  materials  on  policing  and  enforcement  and \nundertake initial training, and (iii) develop a program and training modules to enhance public \ntransport operators\u2019 financial management and operational efficiency. Extensive stakeholder \nconsultations undertaken throughout the project will ensure that the proposed structure for \npublic transport reform is widely supported, especially by passengers and civil society groups. \nThe  findings  of  the  TA  will  be  made  available  to  the  Department  of  Transportation  and \nCommunication (DOTC) for replication in other cities across the country to improve public \ntransport systems and services. \n \n11.  As the TA is likely to affect current operators and passengers, the capacity development \nand stakeholder consultation program will ensure that all social impacts of the project are \nadequately addressed. The TA will work closely with assistance for non-motorized transport \nnow under consideration for Davao.7 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000, of which $1 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation  and \nequipment,  venues for workshops  and seminars,  and  other  in-kind  contributions. The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The government has been informed that the \nimplementation of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will provide advisory services to the government and to the  city of Davao \nregarding the program to modernize public transport. The executing agency will be the DOTC \nand the implementing agency will be the city government of Davao. Capacity development will \nbe provided to staff of the executing and implementing agency alike. TA collaboration will be \nmanaged by a steering committee established under the TA to ensure that the development and \npilot testing of public transport reforms for Davao can be replicated across the Philippines under \nthe guidance of DOTC. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012.

The key outcome of the TA is the design of a public transport reform and modernization \nprogram. The project will be implemented over 12 months from November 2012 to November \n2013. Consultancy services will be provided by a firm. The TA will require 20 person-months of \ninternational  consultancy  and  40  person-months  of  national,  providing  expertise  in  public \ntransport, franchising mechanisms, transport planning, capacity development, and financing and \nbidding documentation. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Consulting services will be \nprovided by a firm selected using the quality- and cost-based method with a standard quality\u2013\ncost  ratio  of  80:20  and  simplified  technical  proposals.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  Reports will be prepared for each of the main outputs: (i) a report of the review of current \npublic transport system operations and services; (ii) a comprehensive public transport strategy \nfor  Davao;  (iii)  a  report  covering  the  public  transport  reform  program,  incorporating  route \nstructure, operation requirements, KPIs, and an implementation guideline and schedule; and (iv) \na  report  describing  a  capacity  development  and  stakeholder  consultation  program  for \ngovernment officials, public transport operators, civil society organizations such as the taxi \noperators and drivers associations and the jeepney operators and drivers associations, and \ncommunity members. Several workshops and training sessions held during the TA will ensure \nbroad stakeholder involvement and capacity development. The workshops and training sessions \nwill be administered by the consultant team with funding from the TA. The findings of the study \nwill be widely disseminated at national and international events and through the ADB website. \n \n16.  As the implementing agency, the city of Davao will ensure the availability of (i) all \nrelevant documents, data, and any other information that may be required by the TA consultants \nto meet the objectives of the TA; (ii) appropriate and qualified counterpart staff and secretarial \nand  clerical  support;  (iii)  suitable  office  accommodation  and  equipment;  and  (iv)  logistical \nassistance for the workshops and seminars to prepare the venue, identify and invite participants, \nprovide secretarial services and seminar coordination. \n  \nIV.
