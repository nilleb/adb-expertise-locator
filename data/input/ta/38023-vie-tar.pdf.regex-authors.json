INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare an expressway network development plan. The TA is \nincluded in ADB's TA program for Viet Nam.1 The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam \nfrom 9 to 13 May 2005 and held discussions with the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs,  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA.2  A  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has grown at 7\u20138% per annum over the past decade, and the \nGovernment projects that this growth will continue through the next planning period at least, as \nit presents in the forthcoming Five\u2013Year Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2006\u20132010. \nWhile this growth has had a dramatic impact on the country\u2019s poverty rate, causing it to decline \nfrom about 59% in 1993 to an estimated 25% now, it has also severely taxed the capacity of the \ncountry\u2019s basic economic infrastructure, particularly its power and transportation systems. A \nrecent ADB-financed traffic study3 found that traffic is growing at around twice the rate of the \ngross domestic product, reflecting Viet Nam\u2019s very low level of vehicle ownership. Thus, traffic \ngrowth is likely to continue beyond 2020. \n \n3.  The Government is acutely aware of the impact of inadequate infrastructure on growth \nand  poverty  reduction,  and  is  already  beginning  to  see  infrastructure  bottlenecks  affecting \nforeign investment and its desire to more equitably share development with parts of the country \nthat are remote from the major urban areas\u2014Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and others. \nFor the road sector, the Government is taking a dual approach: (i) developing a network of high-\ncapacity expressways linking the principal urban areas with each other, with less-developed \nregions of the country and\u2014reflecting the Government\u2019s commitment to the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS)\u2014with neighboring countries; and (ii) developing the institutions required to \nplan,  design,  implement,  and  manage  this  network.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is \nresponsible for implementing this program. To date it has developed a preliminary outline for the \nnetwork and recently established the Viet Nam Expressway Corporation (VEC) to oversee the \noutline\u2019s further development and implementation. \n \n4.  VEC is at present a state-owned enterprise and is likely to remain so. Its functions have \nyet to be defined in detail, but in broad terms include developing a detailed master plan for the \ncountry\u2019s expressway network; preparing projects for investment; mobilizing financing from the \nGovernment, private sector, and development partner sources; overseeing construction; and \noperating expressway sections as they are completed and put into service. VEC has about 60 \ntechnical and financial staff. There is no doubt that VEC has an important role to play in \ndelivering the Government\u2019s ambitious expressway program. To do so, however, it requires \nsubstantial strengthening at every level.  \n \n5.  The proposed TA responds to the Government\u2019s request for assistance to (i) undertake \nan institutional and financial management assessment of VEC so that it can effectively manage \nthe expressway program; (ii) complete a master plan for the long-term development of the \ncountry\u2019s  expressway  network  and,  based  on  this  master  plan,  a  program  of  priority \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Viet Nam. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 9 June 2005.   \n3  Draft final report of the Economic and Financial Study for Preparing the Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor \nProject (TA 4050-VIE), July 2005.  \n ", " 2   \nexpressways that should be developed within the period 2006\u20132015; (iii) confirm the economic \nand financial viability of a priority expressway project suitable for funding within the framework of \na  public-private  partnership;  and  (iv)  carry  out  consultant  selection  required  for  the  GMS \nKunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor \u2013 Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway TA Project.4  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  TA  will  result  in  three  outputs:  (i)  a  business  plan  setting  out  an  appropriate \ninstitutional, organizational, and financial structure that will allow VEC to successfully implement \nthe expressway program; (ii) a long-term master plan for the expressway network, including a \ndetailed plan for expressways to be developed within the period 2006\u20132015; and (iii) detailed \neconomic and financial viability assessment of the priority project, and a financing plan for the \nproject within a public-private framework. Reflecting these required outputs, the TA will be \nimplemented as three closely-related components. The TA will also assist VEC with consultant \nselection  required  for  the  GMS  Kunming-Haiphong  Transport  Corridor  \u2013  Noi  Bai-Lao  Cai \nHighway TA Project. \n \n1.  A Business Plan for VEC  \n \n7.  This component will review (i) government policies, laws, regulations, decrees, circulars, \nand  charters  relevant  to  VEC;  (ii)  the  current  organizational  structure  of  VEC,  with  due \nconsideration of the role and responsibilities of each department and division, segregation of \nduty, staffing, etc.; and (iii) future organizational development plan for VEC. With the objectives \nof  promoting  institutional  efficiency  and  good  governance,  especially  regarding  financial \nmanagement,  accounting  system,  and  auditing,  the  study  will  recommend  (i)  necessary \nappropriate  reforms  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  VEC;  and  (ii)  appropriate \ninstitutional setup for VEC, including mission, objectives, functions of departments and divisions, \nregional branches, performance specifications, and targets. \n \n8.  This component will include a study of toll structure, investment modality, and VEC \nfinancial status. First, the study will discuss and propose the appropriate toll structure, including \nthe toll setup and a toll adjustment mechanism, in close consultation with relevant government \nagencies.  It  will  also  discuss  different  public-private  investment  modalities,  assess  their \nsuitability for application in the Vietnamese context, and propose the appropriate model for the \nexpressways (individually from the expressway master plan [EMP, paras. 9\u201310] below, or on an \naggregate basis, under VEC). The results of this study will be used in developing a business \nmodel that promotes financial viability and sustainability of VEC over the next 20 years based \non financial projections that incorporate investments in EMP and appropriate assumptions for \nsources of funding, toll levels, other revenues, etc. In consultation with the Government, the \nstudy will develop and recommend practical proposals for the capital structure of VEC that \nincludes the level and timing of equity injection by the Government and/or public and private \nfinancial support to VEC, assuming various risks under the expressway projects.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  Loan for the Project is scheduled for the Board consideration in December 2005. The Executing Agency for the \nProject will be MOT and the Implementing Agency will be VEC. \n ", "  3\n  2.  Expressway Master Plan Component \n \n9.  This component will include developing proposals for policy and criteria for expressway \nconstruction, route (origin-destination), priority (2006\u20132015, 2016\u20132025, and 2025 onward), \ntechnical  specifications  to  an  appropriate  level  of  detail,  road  services  and  administrative \nfacilities, cost estimates at prefeasibility level (construction, land acquisition and resettlement, \noperation and maintenance [O&M]), preliminary economic and financial viability assessment \nassuming an appropriate range of toll level, preliminary social and environmental assessment, \nand others.  \n \n10.  The priority plan, for the period 2006\u20132015, will cover expressways with high priority to \naddress present transport bottlenecks, facilitate economic growth, and provide links to adjacent \ncountries.  \n \n  3.  Public-Private Partnership Component \n \n11.  Based  on  the  preliminary  economic  and  financial  viability  assessment  and  the \npreliminary social and environmental assessment, a priority project suitable for funding from an \nADB  loan  and  the  private  sector  will  be  identified.  This  component  will  include  detailed \neconomic  and  financial  assessment,  and  public-private  cofinancing  arrangements  for  the \nselected project. \n \n  4.  Consultant Selection Assistance Component \n \n12.  VEC is the implementing agency for the GMS Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor \u2013 \nNoi Bai-Lao Cai Highway TA Project. This component will assist VEC in carrying out consultant \nselection for the project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  An international consulting firm will be engaged to undertake the TA study, except the \nconsultant selection  assistance component.  To  cover  the  two  broadly  defined  components \n(paras. 7\u201310), the study will analyze the institutional, legal, economic, financial, engineering, \nsocial, and environmental aspects. The institutional study will assist VEC to become an agency \ncapable of effectively managing the development and operation of the expressway network. \nClosely linked to this will be the legal study, which will review the current legal and regulatory \nenvironment and recommend reforms of laws and regulations required for VEC to plan, design, \nfinance, construct, operate and maintain expressways in the country. The economic study will \nassess the economic feasibility of the expressway sections based on traffic demand forecast \nand other appropriate criteria. The financial study will examine revenues, expenditures, and the \nfinancial structure of VEC, and determine appropriate toll levels that will promote the financial \nsustainability of VEC and of the expressway network itself. The engineering study will prepare \nbroad technical specifications for each section of the expressway and develop cost estimates \nfor each. The social and environmental study will examine potential social and environmental \nissues  that  will  arise  and  that  will  need  to  be  mitigated  during  design,  construction,  and \noperation of the network.  \n \n14.  For the consultant selection assistance component, ADB will recruit an international and \na domestic individual consultant, who are independent of consulting firms, to assist VEC with \nshortlisting  consulting  firms,  preparing  consultant  selection  documents  for  the  highway  TA \n ", " 4   \nproject (para. 12), and evaluating technical and financial proposals to be prepared by shortlisted \nconsultants. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,100,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide \n$850,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe Government will finance the remaining $250,000 equivalent in kind through VEC, which will \nassign  counterpart  staff,  provide  office  accommodation  for  the  TA  consultant  team,  and \nnecessary input such as data, statistics, reports, and maps. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MOT and the Implementing Agency will be VEC. \nThe vice minister of MOT will have overall responsibility for supporting the TA implementation \nand  for  providing  guidance,  administrative  and  technical  support,  counterpart  staff, \ndocumentation,  and  other  services  that  may  be  required.  VEC  will  set  up  a  project \nimplementation  unit  headed  by  its  general  director,  with  appropriate  staff  for  day-to-day \ncoordination and to work with the TA consultants as well as with other government agencies, \nparticularly the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, and other interested \nparties. \n \n17.  Consulting services for the business plan for VEC, EMP, and public-private partnership \ncomponents will be implemented by an international consulting firm. A total of 28 person-months \nof international consultants and 31 person-months of domestic consultants will be required.

Objectives \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  (i)  prepare  a  business  plan  for  the  Viet  Nam \nExpressway Corporation (VEC) so that it can effectively develop and manage the country\u2019s \nexpressway program; (ii) complete a master plan for the long-term development of the country\u2019s \nexpressway network and, based on this master plan, prepare a program of priority expressways \nthat should be developed within 2006\u20132015; (iii) select a priority project suitable for funding \nunder a public-private partnership; and (iv) assist VEC in undertaking consultant selection \nrequired for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor \u2013 Noi \nBai-Lao Cai Highway TA Project. \n \nB.  Scope of Work and Terms of Reference \n \n2.  Reflecting the objectives (para. 1), the TA will be implemented as four broadly defined \ncomponents:  (i)  an  institutional  component  focused  on  VEC,  which  will  include  a  detailed \nanalysis of its financial viability; (ii) preparation of an expressway master plan (EMP); (iii) \nconfirmation of the economic and financial viability of a selected priority expressway project \nwithin  the  framework  of  a  public-private  partnership;  and  (iv)  assist  VEC  in  undertaking \nconsultant selection required for the GMS Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor \u2013 Noi Bai-Lao \nCai Highway TA Project. \n \n  1.  A Business Plan for VEC \n \n3.  It is hoped that VEC will be self-financing in delivering the EMP as soon as possible. For \nthe institutional component, the consultants will undertake the following activities and such \nothers as are necessary to achieve the objectives of the TA: \n \n(i)  Review (a) laws, regulations, decrees, circulars, and charters relevant to VEC; \n(b) the current organizational structure of VEC, with due consideration of the role \nand responsibility of each department and division, segregation of duty, staffing, \netc.; and (c) future development plan for the organization of VEC. \n \n(ii)  Recommend appropriate reforms of the legal and regulatory frameworks for VEC \nin consultation with the Government. \n \n(iii)  Recommend an appropriate institutional structure for VEC, including mission, \nobjectives,  functions  of  departments  and  divisions,  regional  organizations, \nperformance specifications, targets, and financial management setup. \n \n(iv)  Review laws, regulations, decrees, circulars, and charters relevant to the toll \nstructure  and  the  existing  toll  setup  methodology,  discuss  advantages  and \ndisadvantages  of  a  different  toll  setup  methodology  and  its  adjustment \nmechanism used in other countries, and propose a toll structure that is suitable \nfor Viet Nam, including a toll setup and toll adjustment mechanism. Recommend \nrequired legislation changes for implementing the proposed toll structure. \n \n(v)  Discuss different public-private investment modalities, assess their suitability for \napplication in the Vietnamese context, and propose the appropriate model (on an \naggregate basis for VEC and, as applicable, for each expressway). \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n(vi)  Assess the financial status of VEC over the next 20 years based on a financial \nprojection that incorporates the EMP investments and the proposed capital and \ntoll structures. Identify risks relating to the financial viability and sustainability of \nVEC, conduct sensitivity analysis, and identify risk mitigating factors. \n \n(vii)  Develop and propose the appropriate capital structure for VEC that includes the \nlevel and timing of equity injection by the Government and/or other forms of \npublic and private financing. \n \n  2.  Expressway Master Plan Component \n \n4.  For the EMP component, the consultants will review the Ministry of Transport\u2019s (MOT) \nexisting preliminary EMP, feasibility study reports of ongoing and planned expressway projects, \nreports of various Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partner-financed \nstudies,  and  relevant  literature; 1   and  undertake  economic,  engineering,  financial,  legal, \ninstitutional, social, and environmental studies, which may be modified in discussions with the \nGovernment and the ADB project team during TA implementation. \n \n5.  The consultants will prepare a draft EMP including policy and criteria for expressway \nconstruction, route (origin and destination [OD]), priority (2006\u20132015, 2016\u20132025, and 2026 \nonward),  technical  specifications,  road  services  and  administrative  facilities  (service  areas, \ncross-border  facilities,  weight  stations,  traffic  information  systems,  and  toll  plazas),  cost \nestimates (construction, land acquisition and resettlement, operation and maintenance [O&M]), \neconomic and financial viability assessment, toll level, social and environmental assessment, \nand others. Specifically, the consultants will undertake the following activities and others, as \nnecessary, to meet the objectives of the TA:  \n \n(i)  Collect demographic, social, and economic data for the country, including as a \nprincipal  reference  the  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  for \n2006\u20132010, and develop three growth scenarios for the economy, assuming low, \nmiddle, and high cases.  \n \n(ii)  Conduct necessary surveys for traffic counts, OD for each major category of \nvehicle, and travel speed. Based on the surveys and the demographic, social, \nand economic data, prepare traffic forecasts for representative traffic types taking \ninto  account  population  growth,  production  increases,  economic  growth,  and \nincome increase. Prepare a nationwide OD matrix distributed by key freight types \nand major domestic and regional points of OD. \n \n                                                 \n1  The formulation of the expressway master plan (EMP) takes into account (i) the results of the GMS Transport \nSector Strategy Study (ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for the Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector \nStudy. Manila [REG 6195]), which will develop, among others, a proposed priority road transport network for the \nsubregion; and (ii) the technical requirements for road and bridge design standards prescribed in Annex 11 of the \nGMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement (CBTA) on Road and Bridge Design and Construction Standards and \nSpecifications, and Annex 12 of the CBTA on Border Crossing and Transit Facilities and Services to the extent that \nthe expressways to be identified in the EMP will form part of the current and future scope of the CBTA. Although \nProtocol 1 of the CBTA on designation of corridors, routes, and points of entry and exit currently specifies only 11 \nroutes along which the CBTA will apply, it is expected that the CBTA implementation will be extended to all major \nGMS roads, including those that will be identified in the GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study. \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(iii)  Prepare traffic flow forecast for each OD-pair, based on the existing long-term \neconomic development forecast for Viet Nam, including forecast of domestic, \nregional, and international trade that originate or depart or may transit Viet Nam.  \n \n(iv)  Assist VEC to prepare standard specifications for the design and construction of \nexpressways. Design criteria will include geometric standard, design speed, and \ncriteria for selecting number of lanes. These standard specifications will be based \non typical international standards for high-speed and limited-access highways. \n \n(v)  Based on outputs of the noted studies, propose an expressway network in the \ncountry, taking into account MOT\u2019s existing preliminary EMP. Identify starting and \nending points of each expressway link, and assume appropriate configuration for \neach link, based on the noted standard specifications for expressways. \n \n(vi)  Develop a broadly defined alignment for each expressway link with reference to \navailable topographic maps, paying attention to minimization of negative social \nand environmental impacts, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Operations Manual (OM)-\nF1  on  Environment  and  OM-F2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines,2 and those of the Government of Viet \nNam. Estimate land acquisition and resettlement cost, construction cost, and \nO&M for each link, sufficient for a preliminary assessment of economic and \nfinancial viability. \n \n(vii)  Develop a traffic assignment model to analyze likely future modal and route \nassignment of the identified freight flows. The model will take into account the \nmagnitude, ODs of relevant freight flows, and the modal cost of tollway versus \nother modes and routes. \n \n(viii)  Undertake a preliminary economic evaluation of each link using the Highway \nDevelopment  and  Management  Model  (version  4)  by  comparing  with-  and \nwithout-project cases. Calculate the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and \neconomic net present value (NPV) of each expressway link. \n \n(ix)  Examine the relevance and economic viability of each expressway link based on \nthe results of the economic analysis (viii). Finalize the expressway network, and \nprioritize the expressway link into short-term (2006\u20132015), medium-term (2016\u2013\n2025), and long-term (2026 onward). If appropriate, apply a phased development \napproach, for example, by the addition of lanes or carriageways, conversion from \nopen to closed systems, etc. \n \n(x)  Calculate  a  preliminary  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  each \nexpressway  link  by  using  the  output  of  the  toll  level  analysis.  Indicate  the \nrelationship between the FIRR and toll level, and assess the financial viability of \ninvestment for each expressway link and the whole expressway projects included \nin the master plan. \n \n(xi)  Prepare project/concept profile for each expressway link, including starting and \nending  points,  expected  construction  period,  configuration  (design  speed, \nnumber of lanes, and interchanges), road service and administrative facilities \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n(service areas, cross-border facilities, weigh stations, traffic information systems, \nand  toll  plazas),  cost  estimates  at  prefeasibility  level  (construction,  land \nacquisition and resettlement, O&M), possible financing plans (state budget, bond, \nloan  from  international  financing  organizations,  private  sector  finance,  other \nsources), economic and financial viability assessment, toll level, potential social \nand environmental issues, and others. \n \n(xii)  Establish  the  link  between  impacts,  outcomes,  outputs,  and  inputs  of  the \nrecommended  EMP,  and  indicate  the  associated  performance  monitoring \nindicators. \n \n6.  The consultants will prepare a draft expressway priority plan comprising expressway \nprojects  that  are  classified  as  short-term  (2006\u20132015).  The  plan  identifies  (i)  goals  to  be \nachieved within 10 years, such as traffic safety improvement, travel time reduction, economic \ngrowth, and income growth; (ii) financial requirements for implementing the projects; (iii) project \nprofiles; and (iv) performance measurements to evaluate degree of achievement of the goals.  \n \n  3.  Public-Private Partnership Component \n \n7.  Based on the preliminary economic and financial viability assessment given by outputs \nfrom (viii) and (x) of para. 5, the consultants will identify a priority project suitable for funding \nfrom an ADB loan and the private sector. Initial ranking of the projects will be based on NPV. \nSelection  of  a  project  from  this  ranking  will  take  into  account  the  preliminary  social  and \nenvironmental assessment given by outputs from (vi) of para. 5 and the financial viability of the \nproject in terms of its suitability for funding within a public-private framework. The consultants \nwill undertake the following study for the identified project: \n \n(i)  Conduct  detailed  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  in  accordance  with \nGuidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects of the Asian Development Bank.  \n \n(ii)  Undertake sensitivity analysis by identifying critical factors on the EIRR and FIRR, \nand calculate switching values.  \n \n(iii)  Conduct detailed financial assessment in accordance with the Guidelines for \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nAsian Development Bank.3  \n \n(iv)  Carry out a risk analysis (using \u201c@ Risk\u201d software) by considering the possible \nvalues for key variables in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Risk \nAnalysis in the Economic Analysis of Projects.4 \n \n(v)  Carry out a distribution analysis of project benefits, and calculate the poverty \nimpact ratios in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of \nProjects, and Handbook for Incorporating Poverty Impact Analysis into Economic \nAnalysis of Project.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001.

The consultants for the above three components will provide ADB with their findings and \nrecommendations to generate synergy and complementarities with ongoing studies and works \nsuch as ADB\u2019s regional TA for the GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study (REG 6195) and those \nstipulated in the GMS-CBTA, currently supported by ADB\u2019s regional TA for Implementing the \nAgreement for Facilitation of the Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People in the Greater \nMekong Subregion-Phase 1 (REG 6098). \n   \n4.  Consultant Selection Assistance Component \n \n9.  Individual consultants will assist VEC with shortlisting consulting firms for consulting \nservices under the GMS Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor \u2013 Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway TA \nProject,  preparing  consultant  selection  documents,  and  evaluating  technical  and  financial \nproposals to be prepared by shortlisted consultants. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.   The  consulting  services  for  the  business  plan  for  VEC,  EMP,  and  public-private \npartnership components will be implemented by an international consulting firm. A total of 28 \nperson-months  of  international  consultants  will  be  required.  The  international  consultants \n(person-months  are  in  parentheses)  will  include  a  team  leader/transport  economist  (8),  a \nhighway engineer (7), a financial specialist (3), an institutional specialist (5), a legal specialist (2), \na social specialist (2), and an environmental specialist (1). Domestic consulting services totaling \n31 person-months will be provided by a transport economist (8), two highway engineers (10), a \nfinancial specialist (3), an institutional specialist (5), a legal specialist (2), a social specialist (2), \nand  an  environmental  specialist  (1).  The  consulting  services  for  the  consultant  selection \nassistance component will be implemented by an international consulting service specialist (2) \nand a domestic consulting service specialist (3) intermittently. \n \nD.  Schedule and Reporting Requirements \n11.  The business plan for VEC, EMP, and public-private partnership components will be \nimplemented over 8 months, between March and October 2006. An inception report will be \nprepared within 45 days of the commencement date. It will include planning of the consulting \nservices and point out issues to be further studied during the engagement period. An interim \nreport will be prepared at the end of the fifth month. A tripartite meeting will discuss intermediate \noutputs in the interim report. A draft final report, prepared by the end of the seventh month, will \nsummarize the consultants\u2019 findings, analyses, conclusions, and recommendations for review \nand approval by ADB and the Government. The consultants will present major outputs at a \ntripartite meeting to be held around the eighth month after commencement. A final report will be \ncompleted immediately after the consultants receive comments from ADB and the Government. \nThree copies of all reports and documents will be submitted to ADB, and six copies to the \nGovernment. Electronic copies of all documents will be submitted to ADB and the Government. \n \n12.  The  consultant  selection  assistance  component  will  be  intermittently  implemented \nbetween January\u2013July 2006. The individual consultants will prepare a shortlisting report, a \nrequest for proposals that will be distributed to shortlisted consultants, a technical proposal \nevaluation report, and a financial proposal evaluation report, and submit them to VEC for \napproval. After the Government approves the reports, VEC will send them to ADB.  \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051216092928+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051124090148+08'00'", "Title": "Expressway Network Development Plan Project", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.5 for Word", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)", "SourceModified": "D:20051124010129", "Company": "Licenced User"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 7 November 2005) \nCurrency Unit \u2013  dong (D) \nD1.00 =  $0.000063 \n$1.00 =  D15,893 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  CBTA  \u2013  cross-border transport agreement \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  EMP  \u2013  expressway master plan \n  FIRR  \u2013  financial internal rate of return \n  GMS  \u2013  Greater Mekong Subregion \n  MOT  \u2013  Ministry of Transport \n  NPV  \u2013  net present value \n  OD  \u2013  origin and destination \n  OM  \u2013  operations manual \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  PIU  \u2013  project implementation unit \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  VEC  \u2013  Viet Nam Expressway Corporation \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Transport and communications \nSubsector  \u2013  Roads and highways \nThemes  \u2013  Sustainable economic growth and capacity development \nSubthemes  \u2013  Fostering physical infrastructure development, institutional \ndevelopment, and organizational development  \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President  L.
