During  the  Country  Programming  Mission  conducted  in  December  2007,  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to help the Government develop a comprehensive \nframework for a river basin water resources allocation and management policy.1 This was \nincluded in the 2008 pipeline as a firm TA project. In March 2008, an ADB mission visited the \nPRC and reached an understanding with the Government on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, \ncost  estimates,  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of \nreference. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The total available water resources in the PRC are estimated at about 2,841 billion cubic \nmeters (m3) per annum. Water availability per capita decreased from 2,250 m3 in 2000 to \n2,150 m3 in 2006; this is expected to decrease further to 1,870 m3 by 2030 when the population \nis forecast to be 1.52 billion. Continuing population growth and rapid economic development \nhave increased water use per capita and competition among potential water uses while aquifers \nare becoming depleted, water pollution is rising, and the ecosystem and environment are being \ndegraded.  \n \n3.   Total water usage increased from 553.0 billion m3 in 2000 to 579.5 billion m3 in 2006\u2014\nagricultural and other rural uses account for 63.2%, industrial use 23.2%, urban use 12.0%, and \nenvironmental and other uses 1.6%. Along with the need to meet increasing water demand, \nadequate flows need to be maintained in rivers to protect the environment and ecosystem. \nGiven the rising urban and industrial demand for water, the share of irrigation water use is likely \nto decrease further. However, because of the political and social importance of food security in \nthe PRC, ensuring that there is enough water for agriculture remains a government priority. \nThus, more attention needs to be given to improving the efficiency of agricultural water use.  \n \n4.   Large annual and inter-annual variations plus continuous dry and wet years make water \nresources  development  complex  in  the  PRC.  There  is  also  a  mismatch  between  water \nresources, and population and arable land. The north accounts for 45% of the PRC\u2019s population \nand 65% of its arable land but only 19% of its water resources. On the other hand, the south \ncomprises 55% of the PRC\u2019s population and 35% of its arable land but 81% of its water \nresources. Water scarcity, either temporal or geographical, leads to intense political pressures. \nFurthermore, water demands are often conflicting, and river basin institutions lack the necessary \ntools to meet administrative challenges.  \n \n5.  Water  resources  play  a  central  role  in  maintaining  human  health  and  welfare, \nenvironmental integrity, and economic growth. The challenge is not only how to manage a \ndeclining resource but also how to respond to the scarcity resulting from the geographic and \ntemporal mismatch between supply and demand. Continuous drought and scarcity of water \nresources have caused over-exploitation of land and water resources in some regions resulting \nin serious environmental and ecological problems. Key indicators of these problems include \n(i) land subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction, (ii) disappearance of wetlands, \n(iii) drying of riverbeds and estuaries, (iv) serious sedimentation, (v) seawater intrusion, and \n(vi) depletion and pollution of surface water and groundwater.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 April 2008. \n ", "2   \n6.  Restoration of the environment is difficult once it has been damaged. Overuse of water \nin rivers and failure to maintain adequate environmental flows in the river systems have dried up \nsome  rivers  including  the  Yellow  River.  Based  on  estimates  from  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources (MWR), water usage for economic development in recent years caused a shortage \nof about 15.5 billion m3 for the minimum environmental flows in the Yellow River basin, Hai River \nbasin, and Huai River basin (or about 17% of the environmental water requirements). \n \n7.  ADB has been increasingly involved in water resources management in the PRC and \nhas assisted the Government in planning water resources on a holistic river basin approach\u2014\nintegrating environmental, social, and economic considerations in regional planning through \nanalysis of different scenarios. ADB, through strategic options for the water sector,2 assisted \nMWR to (i) define a strategic planning process, and (ii) identify and evaluate strategic options \nfor addressing the main issues and constraints in the water sector for effective water resources \nmanagement. Many of the study\u2019s recommendations were incorporated in the revised National \nWater Law, 2002. ADB also assisted the Government in setting out principles and procedures \nfor integrated river basin management including watershed management in the Yellow River.3 It \nhelped  the  Government  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  its  policy  framework  and  investment \nprogram for water pollution control during the 9th and 10th Five-Year Plan period (1996\u20132005) in \nHuai River and Taihu Lake basins; and recommended legal, policy, and institutional reforms as \nwell as investment directions for river basin-based water pollution control and prevention.4  \n \n8.  ADB assisted MWR to (i) improve its capacity to determine the quantity and quality of \nriver flows needed to maintain the ecology and environment of Hai River basin allowing the river \nbasin  agency  to  monitor  water  consumption  against  the  river\u2019s  carrying  capacity,5  and \n(ii) formulate strategies on soil and water conservation and flood management.6 Other donors \nsuch as the World Bank and the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development \n(DFID) are also active in supporting the PRC reform in water resources management. DFID has \nan ongoing project7 with MWR which is pilot testing water resources allocation in the Shiyang \nand Daling river basins in Gansu Province. \n \n9.  Despite progress made in reforming its legal and policy frameworks, the PRC still needs \nto develop its capacity to adopt integrated water resource management (IWRM) to (i) protect the \nrapidly  deteriorating  ecosystem  and  environment  within and  along  rivers;  (ii)  assess  water \ndemands by various users to allocate water properly and enable sustained economic growth; \n(iii) develop the necessary frameworks to allocate water, monitor use, and resolve conflicts \namong water users; and (iv) improve governance on water resources management. Based on \nanalysis of these issues, measures will be formulated to establish modern water resources \nmanagement  systems  in  line  with  a  water  rights  regime  and  an  integrated  river  basin \nmanagement which will improve the Government\u2019s efficiency and introduce market mechanisms \nfor allocation of water resources.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1997.

This translates \ninto fierce competition for water in a context where there is no coherent framework for governing \nwater rights and allocation. Balancing urban, rural, industrial, and environmental water use with \nrational water resources allocation principles and the policy framework is a great challenge for \nthe PRC water resources management. The Government has pilot tested water resources \nallocation programs in several provinces in northern river basins. These programs generated \nsome good results for easing water conflicts between supply and demand, thereby, improving \nthe environmental situation. However, there is a lack of systematic studies, methodologies, \nprinciples, and policy frameworks for adequate river basin water resources allocation. A river \nbasin  water  allocation  system  must  be  developed  urgently  to  improve  water  resources \nmanagement. The TA will address this crucial element to improve the PRC water resources \nmanagement. An effective water allocation system will promote river basin and water security, \npeace, stability, and prosperity at local and national levels. The proposed TA will have an \nindirect  impact  on  poverty  reduction  through  improved  sector  governance,  and  a  water \nallocation system to ensure that the poor have adequate access to water. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n11.  The TA is in line with the agriculture and natural resources development goals of the \ncountry partnership strategy8 to (i) support environmental improvement; (ii) reverse natural \nresources degradation; (iii) address water resource depletion and livelihood improvement for \npeople residing in threatened and sensitive areas; and (iv) promote river basin and ecosystem \nmanagement, and the efficient use of natural resources. The TA will also help introduce new \nknowledge,  innovative  practices,  and  stronger  governance  for  river  basin  water  resources \nallocation and management. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be improved and sustainable water resources management in \nthe PRC. The outcome of the TA will be adoption and use of appropriate framework on river \nbasin  water  resources  allocation  throughout  the  PRC.  The  primary  objective  of  a  water \nallocation system is to maximize the benefits (social, environmental, and economic) of water to \nsociety. This will be achieved by (i) distributing water equitably among regions and users, and \nsetting priorities during water scarcity; (ii) establishing rules for sharing limited water resources \nand maintaining environmental quality for sustainable development; (iii) protecting the long-term \nreliability of the resource from over-exploitation; and (iv) adapting to changes in local conditions \nby accommodating new users while protecting existing users. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will take into account the relevant findings of previous ADB-funded TA projects \nand studies as well as relevant work from other donors. The outputs of the TA will be (i) a report \non  case  studies  of  international  and  domestic  practices  and  lessons  on  water  resources \nallocation  (including  pilot  programs),  and  a  policy  note  on  best  practices  and  policy \nrecommendations to strengthen water resources allocation policy; (ii) categorization of the water \nallocation systems based on characteristics of river systems; and (iii) principles and a guiding \nframework for river basin water resources allocation in the PRC. MWR is presently updating the \nwater  resource  master  plans  of  the  PRC\u2019s  seven  major  river  basins,  and  this  process \nhighlighted  the  need  for  a  systematic  and  sound  methodology  and  framework  for  water \nresources allocation. The TA will help MWR in its current work for the finalization of the seven \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.

MWR also plans to complete within the next 5 years the detailed water \nresources allocation plans for the seven major river basins and other smaller river basins where \nwater shortage is severe or where water conflicts occur frequently. MWR has expressed its \nstrong commitment in applying the TA outputs and implementing the recommendations in the \ndevelopment  of  the  water  resources  allocation  plans  through  consultations  with  the  key \nstakeholders in the river basins. In addition, ADB and other donors will help implement the TA \nrecommendations through pilot programs in some selected small river basins using trust funds \nsuch as the Water Financing Partnership Facility which is administered by ADB.  \n \n14.  Key activities under the TA include (i) a review and assessment of international and \ndomestic practices in river basin water resources allocation in selected countries and river \nbasins including completed and ongoing pilot programs in the PRC; (ii) a comparison of various \nmethodologies and models of water resources allocation, and documentation of best practices \nin  a  summary  report;  (iii)  preparation  of  a  policy  note  on  best  practices  and  policy \nrecommendations; (iv) MWR staff\u2019s study visits and on-the-job training in river basins with best \npractices in water resources allocation; (v) an assessment and categorization of river systems \nwith similar characteristics (i.e., development of an inventory of the river systems); and (vi) a \ndefinition  of  the  principles  for  river  basin  water  resources  allocation,  and  preparation  and \nfinalization of a guiding framework for better implementation of river basin water resources \nallocation in the PRC. \n \n15.  The TA will attach importance to case studies to learn best practices worldwide. During \nimplementation,  extensive  consultations  with  international  and  domestic  water  resources \nexperts and practitioners will be conducted. International and domestic workshops will be held \nto  bring  together  the  key  stakeholders  in  relevant  ministries,  provinces,  and  river  basin \norganizations to exchange best practices and discuss the TA recommendations. International \nknowledge centers such as the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations (NARBO) will be \nengaged to share and disseminate TA results among ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance \n$500,000 from its TA funding program. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund9 for the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility will provide cofinancing of $250,000 equivalent on a grant basis10 which will \nbe  administered  by  ADB.  The  remaining  $200,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services including the provision of necessary \ndata, office space, counterpart staff, local transportation, and other administrative support. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MWR is responsible for the overall \nadministration  of  water  resources  throughout  the  PRC.  It  has  shown  strong  capacity  for \nimplementing externally assisted projects. The TA management office will be established in \n                                                 \n9  The contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway. Administered by ADB.  \n10 The facility will help (i) summarize experiences in several selected international and domestic river basins with best \npractices in water resources allocation; (ii) recommend policies and guidelines to develop a thorough framework on \nriver  basin  water  resources  allocation  in  the  PRC;  (iii)  prepare  a  policy  note  on  good  practices  and \nrecommendations as a knowledge product for the PRC as well as ADB\u2019s other DMCs; share information, lessons, \nand good practices through the international knowledge centers of NARBO; and (iv) conduct an international \nseminar with participation from other DMCs.  \n ", "  5\nMWR to facilitate daily coordination and administration of TA activities and for liaising with ADB. \nMWR will assign (i) an experienced full-time staff member to serve as TA task manager, and \n(ii) counterpart staff who will work closely with TA consultants. MWR will also provide office \nspace, access to internet, telephone and facsimile, and logistical support for TA implementation \nusing counterpart funds. \n \n18.  A TA technical panel will be set up to review and guide the work of TA consultants. The \npanel will consist of international and national experts from various agencies in relevant sectors. \nIt will collaborate with the counterpart team to arrange panel meetings (at inception, midterm, \nand final phases) during TA implementation.  \n \n19.  The TA will be conducted over 12 months from November 2008 to October 2009. A total \nof 55 person-months of consulting services will be required comprising 16 person-months of \ninternational and 39 person-months of national consultants. Required expertise includes water \nresources  planning  and  management,  environmental  management,  natural  resources \neconomics, institutional and policy analyses, and hydrology. The consultant will submit an \ninception report within 4 weeks from TA commencement, and an interim report 6 months after \nthe TA begins. A draft final report will be submitted 11 months after TA commencement, and a \nfinal report at TA conclusion. The inception, interim, and draft final reports will be reviewed by \nthe Government and ADB; and comments will be provided to the consultant. All reports are to \nbe written in English and translated into Chinese. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants engaged through a firm. The \nconsultant will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) using quality- and cost-based selection criteria (with a \nquality/cost  weighing  rate  of  80:20)  and  simplified  technical  proposal  procedures.  Office \nequipment provided under the TA for the consultant will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will be handed over to MWR \nupon  TA  completion.  Disbursement  will  be  undertaken  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nDisbursement of Technical Assistance Grants.11 Advance payment procedures will be adopted \nto facilitate timely implementation of activities related to training, seminars, and conferences. \nMWR has implemented several ADB-funded TA projects with similar arrangements and has \nadequate capacity in managing such funds. ADB will regularly review and supervise by fielding \nmissions at critical stages of TA implementation, particularly at inception, midterm, and final \nstages; and through continued support from both headquarters and the resident mission. \n \n21.  Efforts will be made to disseminate TA results within and outside the PRC including \nsharing of best practices through NARBO, international and domestic seminars, and wide media \ncoverage. More importantly, a policy note on good practices and recommendations will be \nprepared as a knowledge product for the PRC as well as for ADB\u2019s other DMCs.  \n \nIV.
