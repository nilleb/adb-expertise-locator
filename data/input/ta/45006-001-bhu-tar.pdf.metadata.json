INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bhutan has requested support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to develop and install a revenue administration management information system (RAMIS) \nand to conduct a study on revenue policies and related regulatory frameworks. A consultation \nmission in November 2010 and a fact-finding mission in June 2011 formulated the goals and \nstrategies of the proposed technical assistance (TA) and designed its corresponding activities. \nExtensive discussion with the government resulted in agreement on the purpose and outputs of \nthe  TA  and  its  methodology,  key  activities,  implementation  arrangements,  design  and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1), cost estimates (Appendix 2), and terms of reference for \nconsultants (Appendix 3).1 \n \n2.  The TA supports the government\u2019s priorities as outlined in its 10th Five-Year Plan, \n2008\u20132013, which identified the importance of deepening the government\u2019s self-reliance for \nfinancing development activities in the country and ensuring that domestic resources fund a \nlarger share of the development outlay.2 The government seeks to introduce measures to \nincrease revenue more quickly than expenditure in the next 5 years. Revised revenue estimates \nindicate that total government revenue for FY2010 is Nu14,049.0 million, of which tax revenue is \nNu6,482.4  million  (10.5%  of  gross  domestic  product  [GDP])  and  nontax  revenue  is \nNu7,566.6 million (12.2% of GDP).3 \n \n3.  The TA will boost government revenue by expanding the revenue base and increasing \nthe outreach of revenue collection. ADB mission findings make it evident that national income \nsources have not been adequately and efficiently tapped. In this respect, the Department of \nRevenue and Customs (DRC) urgently needs support to strengthen revenue administration with \nthe goal of augmenting government revenue in the face of continued budget deficits and debt-\nservicing requirements. Greater revenue  mobilization will pave the  way for expanding and \nimproving service delivery across the economy. \n \n4.  The TA is in line with the Bhutan country partnership strategy, which seeks to improve \ndevelopment effectiveness by strengthening economic management and facilitating the launch \nof a robust monitoring and evaluation system.4 Although the TA was not included in the strategy, \nthe government has asked ADB to provide it. ADB Management approved the concept paper for \nthe TA on 29 April 2011. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Bhutan has demonstrated strong economic growth in the past decade, including average \nGDP growth of 7% since 2004. Per capita gross national income has almost tripled from $730 \nper year in 2000 to $1,900 in 2008. Bhutan\u2019s economic outlook remains promising in the short to \nmedium term under the government\u2019s development agenda, which is based on democratization \nand decentralization. The robust outlook is also premised on additional hydropower projects \nserving as engines for growth. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 August 2011. \n2  Royal Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2009. Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2008\u20132013. \nFor the 10th plan, the target for domestic resources is to cover 52% of the total plan outlay; in the 8th and 9th plans \ndomestic resources were sufficient to fund only 30%\u201340% of the outlay. \n3   ADB. 2010. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific, 2010. Manila.   \n4  ADB. 2005. Country Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2006\u20132010. Manila; ADB. 2010. Country Operations Business \n  Plan: Bhutan, 2011\u20132013. Manila (Appendix 1). \n ", "2     \n6.  Bhutan\u2019s transition to parliamentary democracy in 2008 was facilitated in part by prudent \neconomic  management  and  strong  economic  growth,  backed  by  an  improved  asset  base \n(driven by hydropower sector development), continuing poverty reduction, and better social \nindicators. Under the 10th plan, Bhutan pursues a wide-ranging development agenda to reduce \npoverty by revitalizing industry, enhancing infrastructure, balancing regional development, and \nfostering private sector growth. The challenge is to achieve the development goals by spending \nmore on development while sustaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal balance. \n \n7.  The fiscal deficit has risen because of higher development spending to meet the goals of \nthe 10th plan and recent wage increases. The FY2011 budget envisages a sharp increase in \nthe fiscal deficit\u2014to 7.6% of GDP\u2014and a significant reduction in the current operating surplus. \nThis deterioration in the overall fiscal position reflects significantly higher current spending \nbecause of (i) the 35% hike in civil servants\u2019 wages, (ii) an increase in expenditure on goods \nand services, (iii) a jump in capital spending, and (iv) stagnant domestic revenue. In 2010, \ngovernment expenditure increased to 40% of GDP (compared with 36% in 2005); it is expected \nto increase further in 2011 because of considerable capital spending on hydropower and higher \ncivil servants\u2019 wages.5 Given the wide and increasing gap between expenditure and tax revenue, \ndebt in 2010 is expected to be about 4.8% of GDP, from close to 0% in 2008 and 2009, \naccording to budgetary estimates. In Bhutan, direct and indirect taxes6 contribute about 46% of \ntotal  government  revenue,  with  corporate  income  tax  the  main  contributor.7  The  DRC  is \nresponsible  for  collecting  these  taxes.  Recently,  the  DRC  developed  several  applications, \nincluding  a  tax  management  system,  revenue  administration  system,  and  sales  tax \nadministration system, for collection of taxpayer data and taxpayer numbers. However, because \nthese different systems are managed manually, the DRC seeks to establish a web-based \nrevenue administration management information system that can integrate them. \n \n8.  In the medium term, the challenge is to limit debt while pursuing the 10th plan goals. \nAlthough the need to contain current spending at or below domestic revenue poses important \nfiscal restraints, both revenue and expenditure reforms are necessary to limit domestic financing, \nto avoid potential crowding out of private investment and building up of the already high public \ndebt. To address these fiscal constraints, the government has agreed to pursue fiscal and tax \nreforms.  On  the  expenditure  side,  the  government  is  committed  to  prioritizing spending in \nsectors such as hydropower and tourism because they will account for a major share of future \ngovernment revenue. On the revenue side, the government proposes to introduce a value-\nadded  tax,  rationalize  indirect  tax  rates,  and  improve  tax  administration.  Harmonization  of \npersonal, business, and corporate income tax rates is also under consideration.8 \n \n9.  To  meet  these  challenges,  the  TA  will  help  the  government  strengthen  revenue \nadministration and build capacity to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in revenue collection. \nThe TA will also help the DRC to work in a more integrated manner with the public accounts \nsystem and to generate the status of the government\u2019s fund position on a real-time basis. The \nTA will conduct a study of revenue policies and regulatory frameworks for broadening the \nrevenue base and streamlining administration.  \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Government revenue (tax and nontax) rose from about 10% of GDP in FY2005 to about 11% in FY2009. \n6  The direct tax includes corporate income tax, business income tax, personal income tax, motor vehicle tax, \nbusiness and professional licenses, foreign travel tax, municipal tax, health contribution, and royalties. The indirect \ntax includes sales tax, excise duty, and customs duty. \n7  National Revenue Report (2008\u20132009), Contribution to government revenue: corporate income tax (16.6%), excise \nduty (7.4%), sales tax (6.5%), royalties (5.4%), business income tax (4.0%). \n8  ADB,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  and  other  international  organizations  agree  on  the  need  for  a \ncomprehensive fiscal reform program to meet the challenges of public financial management facing Bhutan. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be enhanced fiscal space9 to implement the government\u2019s 10th and 11th \n5-year plans. This impact will be measured by an increase in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP. \nThe outcome will be greater tax compliance and efficient tax administration. The outcome will be \nmeasured by (i) the higher number of registered tax filers; (ii) reduced time required for tax filing \nmanagement, including appeal and compensation; and (iii) lower tax collection cost. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To achieve the impact and outcome, the TA will (i) develop and install a web-based \nautomated  RAMIS;  (ii)  deliver  training  programs  for  tax  officials  and  a  public  awareness \nprogram  for  taxpayers;  and  (iii)  conduct  a  study  on  revenue  policies  and  the  regulatory \nframework for expanding the revenue base and streamlining revenue administration.10 \n \n12.  Output 1: Revenue administration management information system established \nand activated. Detailed features of output 1 will include  \n \n(i)  simplified taxpayer registration that will provide unique tax identification numbers, \ntaxpayer registration, and issuance of certificates;  \n(ii)  improved  collection  management  through  billing  and  payment  processing, \ndelinquency  monitoring,  and  collections  (including  nonpayment  risk  rating, \nidentification of defaulters, and payment monitoring);  \n(iii)  high taxpayer compliance through online and self services for filing returns and \ndocuments for achieving compliance, assessment and audit, and appeals to \naddress taxpayer grievances related to, among others, assessments and audits;  \n(iv)  strengthened tax administration using performance analysis, revenue forecasting, \nregulations and notices, accounting, and document management;  \n(v)  facilitated refund processing and compensation, including prefiling notice service, \ninputs processing, error validation and correction, and tax-due determination;  \n(vi)  creation of a taxpayer database with tax identification numbers as a prerequisite \nfor the implementation of an e-filing system; \n(vii)  online data exchange between the DRC and the Department of Public Accounts; \nand e-tax filing with a provision for inclusion of digital signatures in future scaled-\nup operations.  \n \n13.  The cost of the project management specialists (e-governance specialist and system \nengineering  and  network  specialist)  who  will assist  the DRC  during  the  implementation  of \nRAMIS and with procurement of hardware for RAMIS will be financed from ADB\u2019s TA for \nStrengthening Public Management.11 \n \n                                                 \n9  Room in a government\u2019s budget which allows it to provide resources for a desired purpose without jeopardizing the \nsustainability of its financial position or the stability of the economy. \n10 RAMIS will capture collection management as well as data on collection of personal income tax, corporate income \ntax, business income tax, and sales tax. Nontax revenue and customs duty will not be included; however, to give a \ncomplete picture of total revenue collected at any point and because of the substantial size of the customs duty, \nRAMIS will provide details of the collection of customs duty and nontax revenue. \n11 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening Public Management. Manila (TA \n7724-BHU). More than $300,000 has been allocated for the cost and, of this, about $200,000 has been earmarked \nfor procurement of equipment. \n ", "4     \n14.  Output 2: Training programs on revenue administration management information \nsystem and public awareness program. The implementation of RAMIS is expected to lead to \na more accountable system for increasing revenue collection by (i) enabling access to timely \nand accurate information, (ii) tracking collections, and (iii) enabling the DRC to reach out to \ntaxpayers more efficiently and effectively. Training will be provided to government officials in the \ntechnical aspects of a revenue administration system, as well as to enhance their capacity for \nchange management and to increase staff knowledge on rolling out new taxes through the \nintroduction  of  information  and  communication  technology\u2013enabled  tools.  Subsequently,  an \nawareness program will be conducted to increase public understanding of the RAMIS and of \nhow higher revenue resulting from its implementation enables the government to address social \nand economic priorities. At the onset of the TA, the consulting firm will conduct consultations \nwith representatives of the public and private sectors to secure their support for the TA.12  \n \n15.  Output 3: Study on revenue policies and regulatory framework. The TA will also be \nused to (i) broaden the revenue base, improve revenue compliance, and explore additional tax \nand nontax revenue sources in the future; (ii) review relevant legal and regulatory frameworks \nfor introducing new tax and nontax revenues; (iii) improve the efficiency of revenue collection \nthrough the introduction of a streamlined administration process; and (iv) increase accountability \nand transparency in internal governance systems by reducing human intervention in revenue \nadministration. \n \n16.  In terms of impact, the TA assumes that the government will remain committed to tax \nreforms during TA implementation. Changes in the leadership of key government agencies \ncould reduce support for TA activities. At the outcome level, the TA assumes that the selected \ngovernment officials will effectively manage the tax filing system that will be developed with ADB \nsupport and acceptance of the new system will be widespread. The risk at this level includes \ndelayed  implementation  of  RAMIS  because  of  resistance  from  tax  officials  and  a  lack  of \nacceptance among stakeholders. To mitigate these risks, the TA includes training of officials \nand public awareness programs during implementation.  \n \n17.  In  terms  of  outputs,  the  TA  assumes  that  the  demand  by  government  officials  for \nimproving their tax management skills will be sufficient and that they will be able to attend \ntraining programs. Another assumption is that the selected vendor understands and addresses \nthe functional and technical requirements in the solution. The main risks at this level are that the \nsystem used is complicated and that end users may not fully understand how to use the RAMIS \ncorrectly in line with the design and requirements. To mitigate these risks, the implementation \narrangements will include the engagement of a change management expert and the provision of \nproper training by the vendor.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, and administered by \nADB. The financing will cover the cost of consultants who will implement the TA including the \ntraining and public awareness programs. The government will contribute $50,000 in the form of \nstaff remuneration, office space for consultants, and facilities for training programs. Detailed \ncost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n12 The public awareness campaign will be developed by the consulting firm in consultation with the DRC to ensure \nsufficient understanding and usage of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system by taxpayers. \nThe firm will also deploy an IT security specialist to protect the system\u2019s sensitive personal information and \nfinancial data. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The DRC will be both the executing agency and the implementing agency. The DRC will \nchair a project steering committee comprising officials from the Department of Public Accounts \nand  the  Department  of  Budget  as  well  as  the  DRC.  The  DRC  will  establish  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) and appoint a project director as the focal point and principal liaison \nwith ADB. The project director and PMU team will work full time. The PMU team will comprise \nsystem analysts, programmers, and revenue business engineers.  \n \n20.  A consulting firm and an individual consultant will be engaged in accordance with ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm \nwill  be  recruited  using  the  quality-based  selection  method  because  (i) the  assignment  is \ncomplex and highly specialized; (ii) the outputs of RAMIS constitute a pillar of the government\u2019s \nrevenue administration architecture and will require regular upgrades in future generations of \nreforms; and (iii) the need for greater expertise in these areas, which are still being piloted, \nposes risks for the effective achievement of RAMIS tasks; and (iv) the project could fail if the \nbest consultants are not selected, and if coordination with ADB\u2019s TA for Strengthening Public \nManagement is not strong (footnote 10). Interested firms will be asked to submit simplified \ntechnical  proposals.  International  (24  person-months)  and  national  (16  person-months) \nconsultants will be needed under the consulting firm. The international individual consultant (2 \nperson-months) will be recruited using the individual selection method. Disbursements will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \n21.  A workshop will be held and a booklet on best practices and lessons learned in the TA \nwill be published in Bhutan. The workshop and publication will be organized with technical \ninputs from ADB staff.13 \n \n22.  The TA will start on 1 November 2011 and end on 31 January 2015.14 The government \nand ADB will periodically review the TA implementation. The reviews will include evaluation of \nproject scope, implementation arrangements, progress against the milestones, and results of \ncapacity building measures. Specifically, the government and ADB staff will assess and provide \nfeedback on progress reports by the PMU and the consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Bhutan to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund for Developing a Revenue Administration Management Information System, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n13 TA reports will be made publicly available on the ADB website.  \n14 This period is a maximum estimate and can be reduced to 3 years subject to the program customization progress. \nConsultants hired under ADB\u2019s TA for Strengthening Public Management (TA 7724-BHU) are preparing bid \ndocuments for recruitment of the implementation partner, and that may speed up the implementation of RAMIS. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance  Data Sources and \nTargets and Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact     Assumption \nEnhanced fiscal  Increase in ratio of tax  MOF reports   Government remains committed to \nspace to implement  revenue to GDP on year-on- tax reforms  \nDRC reports  \nthe Government of  year basis to 12% in 2015 \n \nBhutan\u2019s 10th and  (2010 baseline: 10%)   \n11th 5-year plans  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nGreater tax  Increase in number of  DRC reports  Selected government officials are \ncompliance and  registered tax filers to 10%  able to effectively develop the tax \n \nefficient tax  of total population in 2015  filing system. \nadministration   (2010 baseline: 8%)   \nStrong coordination between \n  Reduction in appeal cases  DRC reports   different Implementing Agencies \nto 0.8% of total registered  (this TA and ADB\u2019s TA for \n  taxpayers in 2015 (2010    Strengthening Public \nbaseline: 1%)  Managementa) \n \nReduction in tax collection  Public acceptance of newly \nMOF reports \ncost to 1.8% of total revenue  introduced systems \ncollected in 2015 (2010 \nRisks \nbaseline: 2.0%) \nDelay in implementation of e-filing \nand revenue management system \ndue to insufficient capacity of \nrelevant staff \nHigh staff turn over in government\u2019s \nimplementing agencies \nOutputs      Risk \nRAMIS established  By 2015 (for all outputs)  DRC reports   Resistance to regulatory changes \nand activated  emerges among government \nInstallation and full   \nentities and hampers or reverses \noperationalization of RAMIS  MOF reports \nreform initiatives. \nTax files identified for \nauditing using computerized \nrisk-based selection \nimplemented \nTraining programs  At least 3 training courses  DRC reports \non RAMIS and  offered \n \npublic awareness \nAt least 30% of revenue and \nprogram   DRC reports \ncustoms officials trained in \n  RAMIS   \n  At least 2 public awareness  DRC reports \n  workshops on RAMIS  \n \nStudy on revenue  Study completed and  MOF reports  \npolicies and  published on current \nregulatory  revenue policies and   \nframework  recommendations on \n \n  introduction of new taxes \nand nontax revenue   \nProject \nimplemented on  Contracts awarded  DRC reports \ntime and within  according to schedule \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance  Data Sources and \nTargets and Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nbudget  Disbursement according to  Controller reports \nschedule \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.
