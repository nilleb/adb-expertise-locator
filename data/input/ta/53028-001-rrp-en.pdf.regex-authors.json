THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan (PBL) to Mongolia for the Ulaanbaatar Air Quality Improvement Program \u2013 Phase 2. \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Ulaanbaatar Air \nQuality Improvement Program \u2013 Phase 2, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  has  requested  financial  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to address Ulaanbaatar\u2019s severe air pollution problem, which harms \nthe health of citizens and disproportionally affects children and the poor, and is a long-term burden \non the already fragile national economy. The proposed Ulaanbaatar Air Quality Improvement \nProgram \u2013 Phase 2, which builds on reforms initiated in Ulaanbaatar Air Quality Improvement \nProgram (Phase 1),1 is embedded in the 2017\u20132025 National Program for Reducing Air and \nEnvironmental Pollution.2 The government\u2019s ownership of and commitment to implementation of \nthe proposed reforms under Phase 2 was conveyed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 3). Phase 2 will support the government in implementing \nurgent actions to mitigate air pollution during the winter of 2019\u20132020 and introducing medium- \nto long-term clean heating solutions. The TA will facilitate the government\u2019s efforts to continue \nlonger-term reforms through an agreed post-program partnership framework (PPPF). \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Following a period of rapid growth driven by foreign investment \nin mining activities, Mongolia experienced a sharp economic slowdown driven by falling prices for \nmineral exports. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth fell from 11.2% in 2013 to 1.2% in 2016, \nwhile the budget deficit increased to 15.4% of GDP during the same period; this resulted in a \nrequest to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for support. While growth has resumed under \nthe IMF program\u2014reaching 7.2% in 2018, and forecasted at 6.7% in 2019\u2014the country remains \nvulnerable,  with  high  debt,  low  reserves,  and  significant  external  financing  needs.  The \ngovernment\u2019s prudent fiscal policy has enabled it to achieve a budget surplus of 2.6% in 2018, \nwith an expected surplus of 0.6% in 2019. However, the continuing high level of debt (86.2% of \nGDP) constrains funding of urgently needed social measures. In addition, a significant portion of \nMongolia\u2019s debt (equal to 22% of GDP) will mature during 2021\u20132024, and buffers are depleted; \nthe balance in the Fiscal Stability Fund totals 0.1% of GDP, and gross reserves remain below the \nIMF\u2019s recommended reserve adequacy level. Moreover, the poverty rate has increased from \n21.6% in 2014, to 29.6% in 2016, recovering only slightly to 28.4% 2018.3 \n \n4.  Air pollution and its costs. Air pollution, particularly in Ulaanbaatar, is both a contributing \nfactor to and a consequence of Mongolia\u2019s economic challenges. Concentrations of inhalable \nparticulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM ) in areas of Ulaanbaatar exceed \n2.5\nthe limits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) by almost nine times. A 2019 \nstudy for the United Nations Development Programme estimates the welfare costs of air pollution \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nto Mongolia for the Ulaanbaatar Air Quality Improvement Program. Manila. \n2  Government of Mongolia. 2017. Mongolia National Program for Reducing Air and Environment Pollution, 2017\u20132025. \nUlaanbaatar. \n3  ADB. 2019. Basic Statistics 2019. Manila. \n ", "2 \nat $486 million annually and the costs of lost productivity at $58 million, with a combined cost \nequal to 5.6% of Mongolia\u2019s GDP.4 Other estimates are even higher\u2014a recent World Bank study \nestimated welfare costs in 2013 as $2.2 billion annually or 6.9%of GDP and the costs of reduced \nproductivity as a further $144 million annually.5 \n \n5.  The top causes of mortality in Mongolia listed by the WHO include cerebrovascular \ndisease, heart disease, influenza and pneumonia, tuberculosis, and hypertension, all of which are \nexacerbated by air pollution.6 Children are particularly vulnerable to pollution impacts, which can \nresult in reduced fetal growth, preterm birth, pneumonia, impaired brain development, and \nreduced lung function, leading to acute and chronic respiratory diseases.7 Women are most \nsusceptible to the negative impacts of indoor air pollution, given their prolonged exposure in their \nrole as household caretakers. \n \n6.  The impacts are greatest in Ulaanbaatar, which is home to two-thirds of the urban \npopulation; this share is continuing to increase as nomadic herders move to the city.8 These \ninward migrants have largely settled in ger areas, which are now home to an estimated 221,000 \nhouseholds, or 800,000 people (up from 350,000 people in 2000). Estimates suggest that almost \n10% of deaths in Ulaanbaatar in 2013 resulted from outdoor air pollution.9 A 2017 study estimates \noutdoor and indoor air pollution causes 1,400 excess deaths annually, with 33% of deaths among \nchildren from acute lower respiratory tract infections attributed to air pollution.10 \n \n7.  Drivers of air pollution. Access to heating is critical for survival in Mongolia. The harsh \nwinter features daytime temperatures ranging from \u201310\u00b0C to \u201330\u00b0C, and the temperature can \ndrop to \u201340\u00b0C at night. The heating season is unusually long (8 months). Apartment buildings in \nUlaanbaatar are connected to district heating supplies, but the network does not extend to ger \nareas, peri-urban areas named after the traditional Mongolian tent. In the absence of district \nheating, ger area households are largely reliant on the combustion of raw coal for heating. \nGovernment buildings mostly rely on inefficient coal-fired heat-only boilers.11 The burning of raw \ncoal contributes an estimated 80% of ambient PM  concentrations, with coal burning in the \n2.5\ncombined heat and power plants that generate electricity and heat for the city contributing an \nadditional 5%\u20136% of ambient concentrations.12 The contribution of coal burning for winter heating \nis readily apparent in the pattern of PM  concentrations over the year, as shown in the following \n2.5\nfigure. \n \n \n4 AARC Consulting. 2019.

Ulaanbaatar. \n8  In 2003, the government began giving each Mongolian citizen a plot of land of about 700 square meters. For the \nmigrants to Ulaanbaatar, it was an opportunity to settle in the city\u2019s periphery, often using their gers (traditional tents) \nfor housing. \n9  R. Allen et al. 2013.

PLoS ONE 12(10): e0186834.   \n11 Most raw coal burned in ger area households is low-quality coal from the Baganuur mine with high levels of \ncontaminants (e.g., sulfur, ash, volatile organics, and moisture) and a low energy content. As a result, burning raw \ncoal produces significant particulate and sulfur dioxide emissions when burned raw. Gers generally have short \nchimneys, and emissions are therefore not easily dispersed, and significantly impact local air quality in ger areas. \n12 The remaining 15% comes from transport (10%) and the resuspension of dust from unpaved roads and fly ash from \nthe combined heat and power plants (4%\u20135%).

Air Quality (PM2.5 emissions concentrations recorded hourly). \n \n8.  Binding constraints. Key binding constraints to improving air quality and reducing the \ncosts of air pollution are (i) a weak regulatory framework for air pollution control; (ii) a lack of \neffective implementation of short-term measures to mitigate pollution and its health impacts; and \n(iii) inadequate integration of urban and energy planning, leading to inefficient energy use and \nfurther constraining alternatives to the use of coal for heating.13 \n \n9.  Weak  regulatory  framework.  A  multi-agency  coordinating  committee  has  been \nestablished to manage the air quality improvement program. However, there is no permanent \nentity tasked  with  ongoing  oversight  of  pollution  reduction  measures and  support  for their \nimplementation, meaning critical measures may stall or fail to be implemented over time. There \nis a lack of reliable and comprehensive data on current air pollution levels across Ulaanbaatar \nbecause of aging and inoperative equipment, limited spatial coverage, and insufficient trained \nstaff, which makes identifying baselines, designing interventions, and monitoring performance \nextremely challenging. Building standards are incomplete, and in particular, current energy \nefficiency standards do not create incentives for private property developers to exceed minimum \nlevels in order to attract premium prices for cleaner and more efficient buildings. \n \n10.  Lack of effective implementation of short-term mitigating measures. The government \nis  implementing  ambitious  policies  to  replace  raw  coal  use  by  ger  area  households  with \nalternative, less-polluting fuels and electric heating. However, it is essential that at the outset the \nreplacement programs do not result in supply shortages or price shocks that would undermine \ntheir acceptance. Various measures are planned to address these concerns, but these need to \nbe fully implemented, along with accompanying measures to reduce the health costs of pollution, \nwhich disproportionately impact poor and vulnerable households concentrated in ger areas. Most \nhouseholds have health insurance that covers hospital services, but there are high out-of-pocket \n \n13 Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "4 \nexpenses  in  accessing  these  services.14 Vaccination  and  immunization  rates,  which  could \nmitigate the impacts of air pollution, are consequently lower among poor households. \n \n11.  Inadequate urban and energy planning for medium- to long-term solutions. Ger \nareas are characterized by square fenced parcels of land accessed by unpaved pathways. \nHousing is largely either traditional tents or single-storey, poorly insulated houses. Poor quality \nconstruction and a failure to comply with building standards are a persistent problem because of \nlow incomes and inadequate enforcement; this increases fuel consumption and heating costs, \nand exacerbates the pervasive air pollution. Expansion of centralized heating and electricity \nnetworks  to  ger  areas  is  planned,  but  capacity  constraints  and  aging  heat  and  electricity \ngeneration plants mean that such an expansion will need to be accompanied by decentralized \nclean heat supply solutions to ensure full coverage. Potential decentralized solutions include heat \npumps, solar thermal heaters, liquefied petroleum gas heaters, and community micro grids using \nsolar  and  storage technologies.  It  may  also  be  possible  to further reduce  emissions from \nhousehold  stoves  through  additional  improvements  to  briquettes  (e.g.,  by  using  biomass \nbriquettes) and improved stoves. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n12.  Government initiatives and recent reforms. The government launched initiatives to \nimprove air quality in 2011, with a focus on the use of improved stoves, but the aggregate impacts \nwere minimal. This has been attributed to a lack of suitable fuels and the resale of stoves by \nhouseholds to profit from the difference between the subsidized price and market price. National \nexpenditures on air quality improvement peaked in 2013 and then fell sharply, reaching a low in \n2016. Continued spending was directed to recurrent expenditures. Contributing factors included \nthe economic crisis and the ending of the Clean Air Fund.15 \n \n13.  In  November  2016,  the  government  revived  the  National  Committee  on  Reducing \nEnvironmental Pollution and commissioned the national program (footnote 2), approved by the \ncabinet on 20 March 2017, and its accompanying annual implementation action plans (IAPs). In \nthe short term, the program focuses on ending the use of raw coal for heating by replacing coal \nwith cleaner briquettes and electricity. Long-term elements aim to deliver clean and more efficient \nheating services through green development. \n \n14.  Most significantly, a ban on raw coal burning by ger area households took effect from May \n2019. In place of raw coal, the government is expanding electric heating to 41,000 ger households \nand supplying less-polluting middling coal briquettes to the remaining ger area households. The \n2019 and 2020 IAPs include measures to support the production and distribution of over 600,000 \ntons of briquettes for the 2019\u20132020 winter, with over 400,000 tons reported to already be \nstockpiled.  Affordability  is  ensured  by  continuing  the  supply  of  free  electricity  to  ger  area \nhouseholds during winter nights, and subsidies to briquette producers. \n \n15.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that air quality improved substantially during the early \nmonths of winter 2019\u20132020, following the raw coal ban. This is supported by data on air quality \n \n14 Government of Mongolia, Ministry of Health; National Center for Public Health; and UNICEF. 2017. Nutrition Status \nof the Population of Mongolia: Fifth National Nutrition Survey Report. Ulaanbaatar. \n15 The Clean Air Fund was set up under the World Bank\u2019s Clean Stove Project in 2012 and financed over 60% of total \n(recurrent and investment) expenditures (an annual average of MNT16 million) related to air quality improvements \nduring the period it was in operation primarily on improved stoves. It was closed because of changes in the Law on \nGovernment Special Funds, following concerns over the misuse of such funds. \n ", "5 \nin  central  Ulaanbaatar,  where  the  average  PM   concentration  in  October  2019  was  29 \n2.5\nmicrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m3), compared with 42 \u03bcg/m3 in October 2018, and 53 \u03bcg/m3 in \nOctober 2017, for a decline of 46% in 2 years.16 Unfortunately, reliable data on the impacts in ger \nareas are not available because of the limited spatial coverage of existing monitoring systems \nand discontinuities in data series. This weakness will be addressed under the policy actions for \nPhase 2. \n \n16.  Phase 1. Phase 1, which was approved on 23 March 2018 and totals $130 million, with \nimplementation through November 2019 (footnote 1), was designed to support key measures \nunder the national program. Policy actions were grouped by three reform areas: (i) improving the \nefficiency of the national program and regulatory framework on air quality management, with the \nfollowing key policy actions: (a) approving the national program, and (b) approving regulatory \nmeasures, including briquette standards; (ii) implementing urgent measures to reduce air pollution \nand protect human health in Ulaanbaatar, with the following key policy actions: (a) piloting of raw \ncoal  replacement  with  the  distribution  of  80,000  tons  of  briquettes  and  (b)  piloting  of  the \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13)17 immunization program for 40,000 persons; and (iii) \nestablishing mechanisms for environmentally sound and integrated urban, energy, and transport \nsystems, with the following key policy actions: (a) prohibiting onsite coal-fired heat-only boilers in \nnew public buildings and (b) a study on adaptation measures. Phase 1 was instrumental in \nsupporting a ban on raw coal burning through the piloting of briquettes and establishment of \ntechnical standards. \n \n17.  Phase 2 rationale and description. The continued use of policy-based lending continues \nto be an appropriate modality given (i) the impacts and multisectoral nature of air pollution in \nUlaanbaatar, which is at the nexus of the energy, urban development, and health sectors; (ii) the \ncontinuing development financing constraints; (iii) the need for stronger, sustained institutional \nand regulatory reforms; and (iv) the critical need for effective coordination based on community \nand women\u2019s engagement in developing measures to mitigate ambient and indoor air pollution.  \n \n1.  Reform  area  1:  Implementation  action  plan  efficiency  and  air  pollution \ncontrol regulatory framework improved.  \n \n18.  Tranche  1.  Prior  actions  focused  on  strengthening  the  institutional  framework  for \nimplementation of immediate mitigation measures. These were (i) the annual IAP prepared by the \nnational committee approved, which is the basis for the allocation and approval of government \nfunding for the agreed winter 2019\u20132020 actions (i.e., ensuring the supply of alternative fuels); (ii) \na proposal made to the cabinet on the establishment of a secretariat to the National Committee \nto oversee and implement the national program, ensuring that this is in place ahead of the 2020\u2013\n2021  winter  so  that  reform  momentum  continues  and  coordination  of  activities  is  further \nenhanced; and (iii) training conducted for certifiers under the Excellence In Design For Greater \nEfficiencies  (EDGE)18 standards,  which  certify  energy-efficient  public  and  private  buildings, \nenabling them to command a premium price and creating an incentive for private developers to \nimprove energy efficiency, thus reducing the long-term growth in heating demand from new and \n \n16 US Embassy, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Air Quality (PM2.5 emissions concentrations recorded hourly). The October \n2019 average still exceeds the WHO guidelines by a factor of three. October marks the start of the heating season; \nair quality is at its worst in January and February.  \n17 The PCV13 vaccine prevents respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae which is the most frequent \ncause of pneumonia and deaths due to pneumonia worldwide. Children under 5 years of age, particularly those who \nare affected by indoor air pollution in ger households, are at risk of death due to Streptococcus pneumoniae \ninfections. \n18 EDGE is an International Finance Corporation-initiated certification program for green buildings. \n ", "6 \nretrofitted buildings, and the burning of coal. Training of certifiers is a prerequisite for its effective \nimplementation, which is a government policy. \n \n19.  Tranche 2. Policy actions are linked to enhancing the regulatory framework in the longer \nterm: (i) improvement of air quality monitoring standards to enable more effective targeting and \nevaluation of future policy measures, (ii) allocation of funding, staff and premises to make the \nsecretariat to the National Committee fully functional to oversee and implement the national \nprogram, and (iii) endorsement of customized EDGE certification requirements adapted for \nMongolia\u2019s needs by the government as a recognized standard. \n \n2.  Reform  area  2:  Key  measures  on  air  pollution  reduction  and  health \nprotection implemented.  \n \n20.  Tranche 1. Prior actions focused on ensuring that regulatory mechanisms are in place to \ndeliver adequate and affordable alternative fuel supplies following the raw coal ban triggered by \nPhase 1. These were (i) regulations issued on briquette pricing and distribution monitoring. The \ngovernment has calculated that 600,000 tons of improved fuel needs to be manufactured and \ndistributed to Ulaanbaatar residents over the winter period to compensate for the raw coal ban; \n(ii) budget allocated for subsidies to allow for the expansion of subsidized heating tariffs to all \n41,000 ger area households converting to electric heaters, which accelerated the adoption of \nelectric heaters, and consequently reduced the need for burning of raw coal; and (iii) a policy of \nnational PCV13 immunization, which was adopted following the pilot program implemented in \nUlaanbaatar under Phase 1. This measure mitigated some of the worst health impacts of air \npollution and was realistic\u2014although replacing raw coal will improve air quality, it will take time to \nreach a stage where young children and pregnant mothers are no longer adversely affected. \n \n21.  Tranche 2. Policy actions are linked to sustaining the switch to alternative fuels and \nmitigation measures under tranche 1: (i) the switch to briquettes will be supported by a community \nengagement program to help households use briquettes safely and efficiently;19 (ii) a study on the \nreplacement of budget subsidies for winter electric heating costs with a new heating tariff that \nresponds to affordability concerns, so as to avoid the risk of large and unsustainable budget \nsubsidies becoming entrenched; and (iii) expanding mitigation of the health impacts of pollution \nby adopting a new policy on immunization that includes pregnant women and newborns. \n \n3.   Reform area 3: Mechanisms for environmentally sound and integrated urban \nand energy systems implemented.  \n \n22.  Tranche 1. Policy actions focused on creating long-term, environmentally sustainable \nheating services, and covered (i) a concept vision for the next 20-year master plan for Ulaanbaatar \napproved, including measures to support more efficient heating services; and (ii) a green financing \nmechanism established by the national committee for commercial banks to lend to low-income \nhouseholds, particularly those headed by women, for the purchase of electric heaters and building \ninsulation. The national committee has entered into memoranda of understanding with State \nBank, Xac Bank, and Khan Bank wherein these banks agree to subsidize (through lower interest \nrates)  loans  to  eligible  low-income  households.  Retrofitting  existing  buildings  is  vital  to \n \n19 A communications strategy formed part of Phase 1 but was limited to social media and focused on raising awareness \nof the risks of air pollution rather than specific measures supporting the transition to improved fuels. The lack of \nawareness and potential acceptance of the improved fuel by ger residents is one of the main risks identified to \nsuccessful policy implementation and will be addressed by the community engagement program, which will be \ncomplemented by quantitative assessment of the impacts of indoor air pollution to inform future actions. ", "7 \ncomplement the long-term replacement of housing heating systems and the provision of more \nsustainable urban spatial organization. \n \n23.  Tranche 2. Policy actions build on those under tranche 1 and cover (i) integrating specific \nclimate resilience measures, including urban adaptation measures analyzed as part of Phase 1, \ninto the next 20-year master plan for Ulaanbaatar that builds on the concept design under tranche \n1; (ii) developing an accompanying long-term clean heat supply plan for ger areas that integrates \ncommunity  and  gender  provisions  (e.g.,  safe  usage  and  adoption  of  improved  heating \ntechnologies), and identifies centralized and decentralized long-term heating solutions to reduce \nthe need for individual coal stoves; and (iii) providing loans to low-income households, particularly \nthose which are female-headed, for building insulation and heaters. \n \n24.  Post-Program Partnership Framework. The government has agreed to implement the \nPPPF to ensure the sustainability of policy reforms undertaken for Phase 2. These include (i) \nincreasing access to air quality monitoring data; (ii) the secretariat to the National Committee \nassuming its full mandated responsibilities; (iii) raising awareness of the customized EDGE \nstandard; (iv) improving the quality of future community engagement programs for clean heating \nneeds, particularly of women; (v) implementing necessary electricity tariff reforms; (vi) improving \nthe  integration  of  community  and  gender  dimensions  into  future  urban  planning;  and  (vii) \nexamining the potential to expand the green financing mechanism. The TA will also support the \ngovernment in developing an investment road map to implement the clean heat supply plan, \nincluding potential projects for ADB financing.  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s  experience  and  lessons.  Phase  2  has  incorporated  lessons  from  ongoing \nprojects in Mongolia and regionally, notably Phase 1 (para. 13\u201315), and air quality improvement \nprojects in the Greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region (BTH) of the People\u2019s Republic of China.20 \nPhase 1 identified gaps in monitoring arrangements and Phase 2 includes measures to upgrade \nmonitoring systems with TA support. The experience with provision of improved stoves (para. 12) \nhighlighted the need to enhance community understanding of new technologies if these are to \nsucceed; the Phase 2 actions include a community engagement program. The BTH projects show \nthat  a  sustained  process  is  needed,  starting  with  policy  reforms  and  moving  gradually  to \ninvestment projects once the policy framework is in place. The BTH experience has also shown \nthe importance of ensuring timely delivery of alternative heating supplies when ending the use of \nraw coal. These lessons are reflected in the inclusion of immediate actions that seek to ensure \nthe sufficiency of alternative electric heating and briquettes, along with a commitment to develop \nsustainable medium- to long-term solutions. \n \n26.  Complementary ADB activities. ADB has been a leading partner of the government in \nmanaging air pollution and delivering clean energy services. In addition to the program supported \nby the Phase 1 PBL, under the Ulaanbaatar Green Affordable Housing and Resilient Urban \nRenewal Project, ADB is providing project loan support for constructing 1,500 green social \nhousing units and establishing a funding facility for long-term financing of a further 8,500 units.  \nAs an input to the Ulaanbaatar Urban Master Plan, ADB is piloting the use of information and \ncommunication technology tools in ger areas to improve mapping and monitoring.  \n \n27.  ADB  is  undertaking  multiple  complementary  activities  in  the  energy  sector.  At  the \ngovernment\u2019s request, ADB is supporting a study to prepare the country\u2019s first nationwide \nmethane gas supply infrastructure development strategy. ADB is also supporting the expansion \n \n20 ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nof renewable energy supplies, including the construction of 500 kilowatts of ground heat pumps \nin rural areas, the financing of a 15-megawatt solar power plant, and TA for the development of \nan energy storage deployment strategy, and a smart energy system. These activities will be \nintegrated into the clean heat supply plan under this Phase 2. Future investment opportunities will \nbe identified through the PPPF. The program is included in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor Mongolia, 2017\u20132020 and country operations business plan, 2020\u20132021.  \n \n28.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The policy actions under Phase 2 are aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.21 Specifically, the nationwide PCV13 rollout and the influenza immunization \nactions respond to operational priority 1: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities. \nThe replacement of raw coal with briquettes and electric heaters and the incorporation of climate \nresilience into the Ulaanbaatar Master Plan and development of a long-term clean heat supply \nplan respond to operational priority 2: accelerating progress in gender equality, as women are \ndisproportionately impacted by air pollution and will directly benefit from measures to improve \nindoor air quality and access to green finance; and operational priority 4: making cities more \nlivable. Phase 2 contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure Access to Affordable, \nReliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All. It also contributes to the achievement of \nMongolia\u2019s Indicative Nationally Determined Contribution, for which identified measures include \nreducing heat loss from buildings and reducing fuel use by individual households. The total \nestimated climate financing is $71.11 million, of which $62.22 million is classified as mitigation \nand $8.89 million as adaptation. \n \n29.  Development  partner  coordination.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  has  been  closely \ncoordinated with the activities of development partners, including the World Bank, IMF, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation, German development cooperation through Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), and United Nations agencies. Activities \nbeing undertaken by partners include energy efficiency improvements for public buildings, piloting \nof improved fuels and heat supply technologies, expansion of district heating networks, and \nprograms to reduce indoor air pollution. The IMF program includes quantitative targets and \nstructural benchmarks that the government must meet, with quarterly progress reviews that \ninclude  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The  disbursement  of  financing  provided  by \ndevelopment partners is linked to specific agreed actions that are consistent with the IMF \nprogram, but not explicitly linked to any actions therein. ADB\u2019s PBL financing has been linked to \nfinance sector reform, social welfare reform, and air pollution, ensuring that major development \nchallenges affecting the poor are not sidelined in this period of fiscal consolidation. In support of \nthe IMF program, ADB is also providing assistance to restructure and stabilize the banking sector, \nincluding the development of an industry restructuring plan and measures to improve governance, \nrisk management, and competition under the Banking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability \nStrengthening Program.22 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n30.  The country\u2019s overarching development objectives are (i) urban air pollution reduced; and \n(ii) public health and living standards improved (footnote 2). The effect of the reforms is air quality \n \n21 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n22 ADB. Mongolia: Banking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability Strengthening Program. \n ", "9 \nmanagement  in  Ulaanbaatar  improved. 23  A  program  economic  assessment  has  been \nconducted.24 The ban on burning of raw coal and the shift to middling briquettes are expected to \nreduce PM  emissions for 180,000 ger area households by about 35% per household.25 A further \n2.5\n41,000 ger area households are expected to eliminate coal burning entirely through the use of \nelectricity. Given that 80% of the ambient PM  concentration is assumed to arise from raw coal \n2.5\nburning in ger areas, these reductions represent an overall reduction in winter ambient PM  \n2.5\nconcentrations of about 38%. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n31.  Financing needs. Mongolia\u2019s external financing needs, as defined by the IMF, total $648 \nmillion in 2019 and $712 million in 2020. Mongolia will run a slight surplus in 2019, but external \nfinancing will increase to enable a reduction of expensive domestic debt and amortization of \nforeign debt to reduce overall debt levels. The first tranche of the PBL represents 15.4% of the \nexternal financing for this purpose. The IMF approved a 3-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on \n24 May 2017 comprising a total financing package of $5.5 billion. This includes $434 million from \nthe IMF and is backed by development partners, including ADB ($900 million). ADB has allocated \n$600 million to policy-based lending from 2017 to 2020 in support of the EFF, with $380 million \ndisbursed to date.26 \n \n32.  The government has requested a regular loan of $160,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance Phase 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The proceeds of the PBL will be \nwithdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time \nto time). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n33.  MOF will serve as Phase 2\u2019s executing agency and will lead the working group established \nunder Phase 1 to oversee and coordinate the implementation of Phase 2 by the implementing \nagencies: Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Ministry of Construction and Urban Development, \nMunicipality of Ulaanbaatar, Ministry of Energy, and Ministry of Health. ADB will assess Phase 2 \nimplementation based on progress reports submitted by MOF and will field missions to confirm \nthe fulfilment of policy actions for tranche releases. ADB and development partners will closely \ncoordinate to ensure that there is no duplication of activities during implementation. \n \n34.  Phase 2 will be provided as a stand-alone PBL to be disbursed in two tranches. The first \ntranche of $100 million will be  disbursed upon loan effectiveness and is linked to  the full \ncompliance of prior actions focused on the delivery of improved fuels and electric heating to ger \nareas as well as improving the institutional framework for delivery. Tranche 1 actions have been \nachieved. The second tranche of $60 million will be disbursed upon full compliance of prior actions \n \n23 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n24 Program Economic Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 The estimated reduction in fuel consumption from the switch to briquettes is 15%. This is equivalent to reducing the \nfuel consumption of ger households from 4.5 tons of raw coal annually to 3.8 tons of briquettes with associated lower \nspecific particulate emissions of briquettes relative to raw coal. \n26  This comprises $100 million under the Banking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability Strengthening Program, \n$100 million under the first tranche of the Social Welfare Support Program (Phase 2,), $50 million under the second \ntranche of the Social Welfare Support Program, and $130 million under Phase 1. \n ", "10 \nfocused on medium- to long-term cleaner heating solutions in  ger areas. Phase 2 will be \nimplemented from 1 May 2019 to 30 September 2020. The first tranche will be implemented from \n1 May 2019 to 15 November 2019, and the second tranche will be implemented from 16 \nNovember to 30 September 2020. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n35.  The government will require TA to implement key elements of Phase 2 and the PPPF, \nwhere internal capacity is limited. The major outputs of the TA include (i) climate adaptation, urban \nresilience, and gender and community dimensions incorporated in the Ulaanbaatar master plan; (ii) \nclean heat supply plan for ger areas developed; (iii) study on longer-term electric heating tariff \nstructures conducted; (iv) indoor air pollution impact assessment conducted; (v) opportunities for \nscaling up and expanding the green financing mechanism recommended; and (vi) gender and \ncommunity engagement plan developed.27 TA implementation is from the date of approval to 30 \nSeptember 2021. \n \n36.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, domestic transportation, data collection, logistical support \nin arranging workshops and field visits, and other in-kind contributions. ADB will administer the \nTA. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \nADB will also engage resource persons during the implementation period. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2018000) \nItem  Amount \nAsian Development Banka   \n  1.

", "11 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n37.  Environmental and social impacts. The potential environmental and social impacts of \nthe proposed policy reforms have been assessed.28 Program activities are confined to policy \nreforms. None of the policy actions will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or adversely \naffect indigenous peoples. No adverse environmental impacts have been identified. Phase 2 is \nclassified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Phase \n2 will result in improved air quality, which will positively impact public health and well-being. There \nis  a  potential  reduction  in  incomes for people  engaged  in  distributing  raw  coal;  mitigating \nmeasures, including their incorporation into new supply chains, have been established. \n \n38.  Gender. The negative impacts of air pollution fall disproportionately on women. Pregnant \nwomen are severely affected by Ulaanbaatar\u2019s air pollution, while women are more vulnerable to \nindoor air pollution from their roles in cooking in and heating homes and their dominance among \nhealth and education employees who are exposed to indoor air pollution in public facilities. Air \npollution also has a major negative effect on gender equality. It increases the unpaid labor burden \nof women in caring for sick household members and for cleaning and laundry, and reduces their \nability to undertake paid work and pursue professional careers. Phase 2 has been categorized by \nADB as effective gender mainstreaming, and the policy matrix includes the following gender \nmeasures: (i) at least 40% female participation in EDGE training; (ii) at least 40% female \nparticipation in the proposed community engagement program in terms of working with women\u2019s \ngroups and household beneficiaries; (iii) sex-disaggregated evidence of impacts on indoor air \npollution collected; (iv) gender dimensions (e.g., safe usage and adoption of improved heating \ntechnologies) incorporated into clean heat supply plan; and (v) preferential access for women to \nthe green financing mechanism. \n \n39.  Governance.  Procyclical  fiscal  management,  optimistic  revenue  forecasts,  and  the \nmisalignment of public expenditure and strategic priorities are major public financial management \nchallenges in Mongolia. This PBL is part of development partners\u2019 collaborative efforts under the \nIMF EFF framework; the EFF program will improve public financial management by (i) working \nwith the government to significantly curtail off-budget expenditures, (ii) creating a fiscal council to \nprovide independent budget forecasts and cost estimates for new policy proposals, (iii) allowing \nthe government sole authority to determine the total budget spending, and (iv) granting MOF \nauthority to  approve  cabinet  proposals  that  have  a  budgetary cost.  For  Phase  2, MOF  is \nresponsible for ensuring that financial commitments are included as budget line items in the state \nbudget and will ensure that the policy actions are implemented by the implementing agencies. \n \n40.  Corruption. Major corruption risks include weak institutions and enforcement, lack of \ncapacity of integrity institutions, political interference, lack of transparency and accountability, and \nconflicts of interest. Policy actions under the IMF-led program and monitoring indicators ensure \nstrict compliance with program objectives, thus minimizing risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government.  \n \n41.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \n \n28 Matrix of Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInsufficient public  Local information centers will be established and supplier training provided \nacceptance of improved  on briquette use.
