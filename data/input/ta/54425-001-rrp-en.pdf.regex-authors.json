THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe state-owned enterprise, PT Bio Farma (Persero) (Bio Farma), to be guaranteed by the \nRepublic of Indonesia, for the Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for Recovery Project under the \nAsia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility. The project will provide Bio Farma with financing for vaccine \nprocurement and logistics based on an agreed list of eligible expenditures to vaccinate priority \npopulations against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The rapid response component (RRC) \nunder the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) will be utilized. The project is aligned with \nthe following operational priorities of Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iii) fostering regional cooperation \nand integration.1 The project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024, as it will improve the well-being of Indonesians by \nstrengthening the health system and preventing the spread of COVID-19.2     \n \n2.  The project fulfills all APVAX access criteria as shown in Table 1.   \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility  \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1.  Demonstrated  COVID-19 has infected more than 1.3 million Indonesians, causing about 35,000 fatalities, \nadverse impact of  including more than 840 fatalities of health care workers. Health services have suffered \nCOVID-19  severe disruption. Women have been exposed to greater risk than men because of their \n  professional  affiliations  and  roles  within  households.  COVID-19  caused  real  gross \ndomestic product to contract by 2.1% in 2020, down from an original growth forecast of \n5.2%. Approximately 30 million people have experienced reductions in work hours or job \nloss, worsening the incidence of poverty.  \n2.  Completed needs  The  government  has  assessed  vaccine  needs  using  the  Vaccination  Introduction \nassessment   Readiness Assessment Tool developed by WHO and UNICEF, which has identified gaps \nin  logistics,  service  delivery,  pharmacovigilance,  and  vaccine  acceptance.  The \ngovernment has started to strengthen cold chain storage and distribution capacity, train \nvaccinators, develop guidelines for adverse effects following immunization, and scale up \n \nrisk communication and community engagement.\nNational  Presidential  Regulation  No.  99/2020,  as  amended  by  Presidential  Regulation  No. \nVaccination  14/2021, provides the legal basis for Indonesia\u2019s Vaccination Allocation Plan, which \nAllocation Plan  comprises,  among  others,  access  prioritization  criteria,  a  procurement  plan,  and \nimplementation  arrangements,  including  a  medical  waste  management  plan. \nRecommendations from the Indonesian Technical Advisory Group on Immunizations and \nthe WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization are incorporated into the \nVaccination Allocation Plan, which consists of government-funded and employer-funded \nprograms. Given the devastating impact of the pandemic on the health care system and \nthe economy, the government is seeking to vaccinate 181.5 million Indonesians, or 67% \nof the population. Vaccinations under the government-funded program are free of charge \nand mandatory. In parallel, the employer-funded program seeks to accelerate vaccination \ncoverage by allowing businesses to pay for the free provision of vaccinations to their \nemployees and families.  \nIncremental  Standard operating procedures for collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical \nmedical waste  waste, overseen by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, \nmanagement plan  have been strengthened in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nGovernor\u2019s letter  ADB has received the Governor\u2019s letter confirming the government\u2019s commitment to \nimplement its VAP and comply with vaccine eligibility criteria under the Asia Pacific \nVaccine Access Facility. \n3.  Established  The Committee for Handling COVID-19 and National Economic Recovery, through its \neffective  project  management  office,  regularly  engages  with  development  partners  on  the \ndevelopment  Vaccination Allocation Plan and the needs assessment.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background. COVID-19 continues to spread widely in Indonesia, with more than 1.3 \nmillion people infected and about 35,000 fatalities as of early March 2021.3 In February 2021, the \ndaily positivity rate (the percentage of individuals who tested positive out of the total number \ntested) stood at over 20% which is significantly higher than the 5% benchmark set by the World \nHealth Organization (WHO). Surveillance systems and volunteers have been deployed to carry \nout contact tracing, but a wide gap remains between the number of cases suspected and tested.4 \n \n4.  Impact on the health system.5 COVID-19 has affected the delivery of health services in \nIndonesia and hampered the attainment of universal health coverage. With more than 840 \nfatalities among health care workers, COVID-19 has hindered the delivery of health services,6 \nreducing working hours and service provision in around half of the country\u2019s 10,000 community \nhealth centers.7 Fear of contracting the virus is reported to have depressed public utilization of \nhealth services in 92% of community health centers.8 Disruption to routine health services, \nincluding immunization, could raise the incidence of communicable disease, which would further \nstrain a health system already struggling to cope with COVID-19.9  \n \n5.  Impact  on  poor  and vulnerable  groups.  COVID-19  has  had  a severe  impact  on \nIndonesia\u2019s economy, causing real gross domestic product to contract by 2.1% in 2020, the first \ncontraction in over 2 decades. The pandemic also reversed some hard-won development gains. \nApproximately 30 million people have experienced reduced work hours or job loss,10 and the \npoverty rate rose from 9.2% in September 2019 to 10.2% in September 2020.11 Regional inequity \nin health outcomes has been exacerbated (footnote 7), partly because 17% of the population \nlacks national health insurance coverage, which impedes health care access.12 As older people \nare particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, people aged 60 and over account for more than 48% of \ndeaths related to COVID-19 in the country.13  \n \n \n3    Government of Indonesia.

COVID-19 has put women\u2019s health at greater risk because of reduced \naccess to sexual and reproductive health services. Moreover, women are at higher risk of \nexposure to COVID-19 than men as they comprise the majority of health and social workers (68%) \nand nurses and doctors (74%) and are more likely than men to be caregivers in the home.14 A \nrecent survey reported that about 65% of women have spent more time on unpaid domestic work \nsince the pandemic began than previously.15 An estimated 39% of female informal workers have \nlost their jobs, with only 20% of them receiving government support.16 Further, the number of \nreported cases of violence against women and girls has increased during the pandemic.17  \n \n7.  Government coordination for COVID-19 vaccination. The government has established \na robust set of mechanisms to coordinate its response across different levels of government. The \nCommittee for Handling COVID-19 and National Economic Recovery, headed by the coordinating \nminister for economic affairs, oversees COVID-19 response, including the vaccination program. \nThe executive chair of the committee is the Minister of State-owned Enterprises, who has been \nclosely  coordinating  vaccine  procurement  efforts.18  Vaccination  implementation  teams\u2014\ncomprising  central,  provincial,  and  district  officials\u2014have  been  assigned  to  ensure  strong \ncoordination  of  vaccination  administration  activities.  Provincial  and  city  and/or  district \ngovernments will assume responsibility, through their health offices, for service delivery including \nvaccine administration, while local government units, especially in subdistricts and villages, will \nsupport registration and community engagement efforts. Presidential Regulation No. 99/2020, as \namended by Presidential Regulation No. 14/2021, sets out implementation arrangements for \nvaccine procurement and distribution.19 It authorizes the Minister of Health to assign the 100% \nstate-owned  vaccine  manufacturer,  Bio  Farma,  and  its  subsidiaries,  PT  Indofarma  Tbk \n(Indofarma) and PT Kimia Farma Tbk (Kimia Farma), to procure vaccines.20  \n \n8.  The Minister of Health assigned to Bio Farma and Indofarma lead roles in procuring \nCOVID-19 vaccines for three reasons. First, Bio Farma is the sole supplier of vaccines for the \nNational Immunization Program, and has a track record of delivering vaccines expeditiously to \nsuppress past disease outbreaks.21 With annual production capacity of approximately 2 billion \ndoses and 12 WHO-prequalified vaccines, Bio Farma has played an integral role in bolstering \nnational, regional, and global health security. Second, since its establishment in 1890, Bio Farma \nhas acquired deep expertise and a broad network in the global vaccine industry, which has \npositioned it well to source COVID-19 vaccines quickly and negotiate cost-effective purchase \n \n14  Australia Indonesia Partnership for Economic Development. 2020.

Finally, Bio Farma and Indofarma possess the requisite logistics \ncapability to import, store, and deliver vaccines safely and efficiently.  \n \n9.  Government\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Plan (VAP).22 Presidential Regulation \nNo. 99/2020, as amended by Presidential Regulation No. 14/2021 (footnote 19), provides the \nlegal basis for Indonesia\u2019s VAP, which comprises, among others, access prioritization criteria, a \nprocurement plan, and implementation arrangements, including a medical waste management \nplan.  These  plans  are  supported  by  various  decrees23  and  guidelines,24  incorporating \nrecommendations from the Indonesian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization.25 The VAP \nconsists of government- and employer-funded programs. To attain herd immunity as quickly as \npossible to aid economic recovery, the government seeks to vaccinate, free of charge, 181.5 \nmillion Indonesians, or 67% of the population.26 Eligible target groups and their order of priority \nare summarized in Table 2. The order of priority is consistent with the recommendations of the \nWHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, as it first protects health care \nworkers, public officers, older people, and people at high risk of infection.27 Vaccination began on \n13 January 2021. As of 5 March 2021, 2.4 million health care workers, public officers, and people \naged 60 and over had received their first dose, and over 1.1 million of them, mostly health care \nworkers, had received the required two doses.28 \n \nTable 2: Prioritization of Vaccine Access  \nPhasea  Order of priority  Location \n1  Around 1.3 million health care workers, and assistants, support staff, and medical students  Nationwide \nworking in facilities, aged 18\u201359   \n2  a.

Exemptions and postponements are permitted for medical \nreasons.29 Service providers carry out pre-vaccination screening, with additional screening for \nthose over 60 years old, to determine whether exemptions or postponements apply.30 Under \nPresidential Regulation 14/2021, failure by eligible recipients to participate in the vaccination \nprogram  may  result  in  imposition  of  administrative  sanctions  by  ministries,  agencies  and \nsubnational  governments  in  accordance  with  their  respective  authorities.31  Further,  eligible \nrecipients who do not participate in vaccination and also obstruct the implementation efforts to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19 may incur sanctions pursuant to Law No. 4 of 1984 on Infectious \nDisease Outbreaks.32 The government expects that vaccination, together with comprehensive \nsocial assistance programs, can shield the poor and vulnerable from negative impacts arising \nfrom COVID-19.33 Presidential Regulation 14/2021 also provides for the cost of medical care and \ncompensation in case of any adverse events following immunization (AEFI) to encourage vaccine \nuptake.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  some  evidence  that  government  advocacy  efforts  are \ncontributing to one of the highest vaccine acceptance rates in the world,34 with one Indonesia-\nspecific survey showing an acceptance rate of 80%.35 There is clear recognition within the \ngovernment that awareness building campaigns and advocacy will drive the success of the \nvaccination program with sanctions being a last resort. In the rollout of the vaccination program, \nthe government\u2019s first and foremost focus is to achieve early success and provide a high degree \nof assurance to the people that collective action is critical to ensure positive health outcomes and \nrestoration of livelihoods.  \n \n11.  Employer-funded vaccination program. This program seeks to accelerate vaccination \ncoverage by allowing businesses to purchase COVID-19 vaccines from Bio Farma or other \nentities authorized by the Minister of Health to vaccinate employees and their families free of \ncharge. Bio Farma and Kimia Farma will procure vaccines for the employer-funded program. To \nringfence human resources and logistics capacity for the government-funded program, vaccines \nprocured  through  the  employer-funded  program  must  differ  from  those  procured  for  the \ngovernment-funded program, and health facilities that administer vaccinations under this program \nmust similarly differ from those under the government-funded program. The central government \nwill regulate and oversee the implementation of vaccination under the employer-funded program \nby establishing (i) minimum standards for health facilities providing vaccination services, (ii) a \nprice ceiling for the vaccination that covers vaccines and associated services, and (iii) reporting \nrequirements.

The timing of vaccinations under the employer-\nfunded program will be subject to vaccine availability, but it is expected that priority groups under \nphases 1 and 2 will already have been largely vaccinated before its rollout.      \n \n12.  Procurement plan. The government has mandated that all vaccines to be procured must \nbe listed under the Ministry of Health (MOH) decree HK.01.07-MENKES-12758/202036 and that, \nprior to administration, emergency use authorization or a distribution permit must be obtained \nfrom the Indonesian Food and Drug Supervisory Authority (footnote 23). Table 3 summarizes the \ngovernment-authorized short-term vaccine procurement plan as of early March 2021 for 2021\u2013\n2022, which was developed on the basis of cost, availability, efficacy, cold-chain capacity, and \npotential for domestic production. The government, Bio Farma, and Indofarma have entered into \nbinding commitments as shown in Table 3 to vaccinate 181.5 million Indonesians.  \n \nTable 3: Short-Term COVID-19 Vaccine Procurement Plana \nAstraZeneca  Serum Institute  Sinovac Life \nSupplier  Indonesiab  COVAX/GAVI  of Indiad  Sciences  Others \nRequested  50.0  108.0  50.0  125.5e  Negotiations \nbinding  ongoing with \ncommitment  Pfizer (for the \n(million doses)  government-\nEstimated  Q2 2021\u2013Q1  Q2 2021\u2013Q1  Q2 2021\u2013Q1 2022   Q4 2020\u2013Q1  funded program) \ndelivery timeline  2022  2022  2022   as well as \nPurchase  Signed with Bio  Allocation letter  Signed with  Bulk vaccine  Sinopharm and \nagreement  Farma in  from COVAX  Indofarma in  contract signed  Moderna (both \nstatus  December 2020  received by  October 2020 and  with Bio Farma in  for the employer-\nMinistry of Health  updated through  September 2020  funded program)  \non 26 February  commitment letter \n2021c   in December 2020 \nCOVAX = COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GAVI = Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, Q \n= quarter.  \na  Assessment of how vaccines supplied by AstraZeneca Indonesia, Serum Institute of India, and Sinovac Life Sciences \nmay meet vaccine eligibility criteria under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility is set forth in Eligibility Criteria for \nUse of Funds Under the Rapid Response Component (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nb  Manufacturing of AstraZeneca vaccine subcontracted to Siam BioScience of Thailand.   \nc  Indonesia has been allocated 11.7 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through May 2021. \nd  Manufacturing Covovax vaccine using technology licensed from Novavax.

Medical waste management plan.37 The government anticipates an increase in medical \nwaste such as syringes, vials, and personal protective equipment from vaccinators because of \nCOVID-19 vaccinations. Prior to COVID-19, standard operating procedures were in place for \ncollection, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical waste, overseen by the MOH and Ministry \nof Environment and Forestry. These procedures were strengthened in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic (para. 36). Currently, 20 of 34 provinces have at least one licensed medical waste \ntreatment facility, and provinces lacking one send their waste to neighboring provinces for \ntreatment and disposal. To enhance waste management capacity, the government is installing \n \n36  At present, these vaccines are those manufactured by AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech, \nSinovac Life Sciences, Sinopharm, and Bio Farma. \n37  Due Diligence of Indonesia\u2019s Medical Waste Management System (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "  7 \nadditional centralized waste treatment facilities and procuring more equipment for sterilization and \ndisposal, including autoclaves and incinerators.  \n \n14.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). To ensure the successful implementation of the VAP, \nthe government is putting in place the One Data system, an integrated data management system \nfor M&E. The One Data system tracks the vaccination process at each stage (pre-, during, and \npost-immunization) under the supervision of relevant agencies and ministries. The government \nwill collate data on eligibility and basic personal details, monitor and record coverage (including \nfollow-up for second doses) and certification, monitor service quality and pharmacovigilance, and \nreconcile demand and supply logistics data. To improve accountability, reports for M&E purposes \nproduced from the One Data system will be made publicly available.   \n \n15.  Needs assessment.38 Using the Vaccination Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool \n(VIRAT) developed by WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), MOH regularly \nassesses readiness for COVID-19 vaccination introduction and administration with support from \ndevelopment  partners  and  the  Indonesian  Technical  Advisory  Group  on  Immunization.39 \nIndonesia has made good progress so far, but challenges remain. In the area of logistics, a recent \nUNICEF assessment of 9,750 health facilities showed that 27 of 34 provinces need to upgrade \ntheir cold chain equipment, and 447 of 514 districts lack adequate equipment to accommodate \nthe expected volume of COVID-19 vaccines. At minimum, 110 walk-in cold rooms and 5,400 ice-\nlined refrigerators are required.40 To address these gaps, discussions are under way with MOH \nfor Bio Farma to enter contractual arrangements with private logistics companies to provide \nadditional cold-chain storage and distribution capabilities, while the government will procure and \nupgrade or repair equipment for health facilities. Bio Farma\u2019s logistics management information \nsystem monitors the location of vaccines and temperature conditions. As of early March 2021, \nmore than 13,000 service points that fulfill minimum standards for vaccination had been identified, \nand at least 30,000 vaccinators had been trained. Simulation exercises to check the service flow \nand procedures have taken place at four health centers. Further training for health workers is \nexpected, and incentives for vaccinators are being planned. Regarding pharmacovigilance, the \nIndonesian Food and Drug Supervisory Authority will issue approvals for all vaccines prior to \nadministration. Guidance for AEFIs has been developed, and national and provincial AEFI \ncommittees have been established. While a recent survey shows vaccine acceptance to be \naround 80%,41 in the past Indonesia has experienced challenges relating to hesitancy.42 To \naddress  vaccine  hesitancy,  development  partners  have  supported  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of communications and advocacy strategies, and the government has undertaken \ncommunication campaigns to build public confidence and address misinformation. MOH oversees \nthe implementation of VIRAT activities, with support from ministries, agencies, and development \npartners including ADB. \n \n16.  Financing needs. To finance vaccine procurement and rollout, the government has so \nfar allocated $3.98 billion in budgetary resources.43 Bio Farma and Indofarma have the public \nmandate for procuring COVID-19 vaccine doses (Table 3) under the government-funded program \namounting to more than $1.5 billion in 2021\u20132022. Bio Farma and Indofarma require immediate \nfinancing of at least $1.0 billion to meet payment obligations under existing vaccine purchase \n \n38  Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39   The needs assessment is informed by the VIRAT. \n40   UNICEF. 2021.

Development  partner  coordination.44  The  Committee  for  Handling  COVID-19  and \nNational Economic Recovery regularly engages through its project management office with \ndevelopment partners on the VAP and on the vaccine needs assessment. WHO coordinates \nmonthly information-sharing among development partners supporting VAP implementation. ADB \nleads  meetings  of  key  partners  providing  vaccine-related  support  to  Indonesia,  including \nAustralia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, the United \nStates Agency for International Development, and the United States Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. Immediate financing support is expected from (i) the World Bank, which is \nplanning to provide additional financing of $500 million to the government for vaccine deployment \nand COVID-19 public health response more generally, including scaled up testing and health \nworker capacity building, with approval expected in May 2021; and (ii) the Islamic Development \nBank through the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation, which is planning to provide a \nworking capital facility of $100 million to Bio Farma, to be guaranteed by the sovereign.   \n  \nB.  Project Description \n \n18.  Impact and outcome. The government, through the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises \nand Ministry of Finance, and Bio Farma have requested ADB support for COVID-19 vaccine \nprocurement and logistics under APVAX to help address Indonesia\u2019s urgent public health and \neconomic challenges associated with COVID-19. The project is aligned with the following impacts: \ntransmission of COVID-19 reduced, public health improved, and economic productivity restored \n(footnote 23); and SARS-CoV2\u2019s spread, morbidity, and mortality reduced; and confidence of \ncitizens restored.45 The project will have the following outcome: priority populations vaccinated \nagainst COVID-19, with the target of vaccinating at least 27 million people assuming a minimum \nwastage rate of 15%.46  \n \n19.  Output: COVID-19 vaccines procured and deployed to provinces. The project will \nprovide financing for vaccine procurement by Bio Farma and/or its subsidiary Indofarma through \nthe RRC of APVAX for the delivery to MOH-designated locations of at least 65 million doses of \nCOVID-19 vaccine under the government-funded program. The agreed eligible expenditure items \nunder the RRC are (i) vaccines that meet any of the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria,47 including \nfor any advance payments; and (ii) international logistics and related services required for the \ntransportation of vaccines from the place of purchase to designated delivery points in Indonesia. \nBio Farma and Indofarma have entered into agreements with a number of COVID-19 vaccine \nsuppliers, and the potential pathways for such vaccines to satisfy the eligibility criteria have been \nidentified.48  \n \n20.  ADB technical assistance (TA)49 will assist smooth distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. \nSupport will be given to (i) upgrade Bio Farma\u2019s vaccine logistics management information system \nto incorporate predictive analytical features that can forecast vaccine demand and support \n \n44   Development Partner Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n45  ADB. 2020.

ADB Value Addition and Experience \n \n21.  ADB will deploy a mix of financing and TA modalities to support the formulation and \nimplementation of the government\u2019s VAP. First, knowledge work undertaken by ADB helped \ninform the government\u2019s prioritization of vaccine access and deployment plans.50 Second, the low \nfinancing cost of the proposed ADB loan to Bio Farma for vaccine procurement will result in lower \nvaccine prices for the government as it seeks to vaccinate its citizens free of charge. Third, ADB \nTA support to upgrade Bio Farma\u2019s vaccine logistics management information system and provide \nrelated training and certification, including to women, will ensure that vaccines are deployed to \nappropriate locations expeditiously and with minimal risk of wastage. Fourth, ADB is supporting \nthe MOH to establish a new strategic delivery unit that will be closely involved in coordinating and \nmonitoring the implementation of the VAP.51 To ensure that Indonesia is adequately prepared for \nthe next pandemic, ADB is planning to provide financing support to Bio Farma to expand its \ncapacity to produce non-COVID-19 vaccines through a project tentatively planned for Board \nconsideration later in 2021. ADB will support Indonesia\u2019s health sector reform strategy, and the \nalignment  of  national  vaccine  activities  and  COVID-19  recovery  plans  with  those  of  other \nmembers of Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \n \n22.  In 2020, ADB worked closely with MOH and UNICEF on the delivery of critical medical \nequipment and supplies through a $3.0 million grant under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response \nFund.52 In April 2020, ADB committed $1.5 billion under the COVID-19 Active Response and \nExpenditure Support Program to provide budget support for urgent public health, social, and \neconomic assistance.53 In September 2020, ADB approved the $500 million Disaster Resilience \nImprovement Program to help manage fiscal risks arising from future disasters triggered by \nnatural hazards and pandemics.54 The following lessons from these interventions have been \nincorporated in to project design: (i) the need to leverage the knowledge and expertise of leading \nhealth sector agencies, such as WHO and UNICEF, in formulating the needs assessment and \nrisk mitigation measures, (ii) the importance of having a robust coordination mechanism among \nrelevant ministries through establishment of a steering committee, and (iii) the critical need for \nstrong data analytics capability in driving sound policy making through investments in information \ntechnology systems.      \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n23.  The project is estimated to cost $795 million (Table 4).

To finance the project, Bio Farma has requested a regular loan of $450 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  under  the  APVAX  RRC,  which  will  be  backed  by  a  sovereign \nguarantee. Because of its unique financing needs, Bio Farma has also requested that the loan \nhave a 3-year term, including a grace period of 2 years. This is because Bio Farma has \ndetermined a 3-year loan term to be sufficient for it to complete the procurement and deployment \nof COVID-19 vaccines and receive full payment from the government for the sale of such \nvaccines, the proceeds of which will be used to repay the loan. Since APVAX policy prescribes a \n10-year term for the RRC component (footnote 45), a Board waiver will be required for the shorter \nterm of 3 years.56 Such a waiver is justified on the basis that it better meets the financing needs \nof  Bio  Farma,  while  also  benefiting  ADB  through  lower  capital  utilization  and  liquidity \nrequirements. The loan will have its annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. For this loan, \nbased on a custom-tailored loan amortization schedule, the average maturity is 2.8 years, with no \nmaturity premium payable to ADB. Bio Farma has made its own independent decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility.  \n \n25.  The summary financing plan is in Table 5. In the event Bio Farma chooses to utilize loan \nproceeds to procure COVID-19 vaccine from the Serum Institute of India through Indofarma, then \n(i) Bio Farma shall enter into an onlending agreement with Indofarma, and (ii) Indofarma shall \nenter into a project agreement with ADB. \n \nTable 5: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (APVAX RRC loan)  450.0  57 \nB  io Farma and Indofarma  345.0  43 \nTotal  795.0  100 \nAPVAX = Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, RRC = rapid response component. \n  \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Bio Farma, and Indofarma estimates.\n \n \n56  APVAX policy sets the terms for regular ordinary capital resources loans to Group C developing member countries \nat (i) up to the first $500 million, 10 years including a grace period of up to 3 years; and (ii) above $500 million, 5 \nyears including a grace period of up to 3 years. \n ", "  11 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  Procurement will be carried out in a manner consistent with simplified and expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nFollowing the APVAX policy (footnote 45), ADB member country procurement eligibility restriction \nwill be waived, and universal procurement will apply. Value for money will be achieved by securing \nmultiple types of vaccines on reasonable commercial terms and through close monitoring of \ncontract  implementation  to  improve  the  probability  of  timely  delivery.  Implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 55). \n \nTable 6: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2021\u2013June 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2022  \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2022 \nSteering committee  The committee\u2014chaired by the Minister of Health and comprising senior representatives \nfrom Bio Farma, Indofarma, the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, Ministry of Finance, \nthe Ministry of Health, and Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2014will meet on a quarterly \nbasis to review progress and any actions required to strengthen implementation.    \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Bio Farma \n(ii)  Implementing agency  Indofarma \nProcurement   Multiple contracts for the purchase of eligible vaccines through direct contracting will be \nfinanced in full or in part by up to $445.27 million of the loan proceeds \nRetroactive financing  Retroactive financing (not exceeding 30% of the loan amount) of eligible expenditures \nand/or advance contracting   incurred after the presidential declaration of a public health emergency on 31 March 2020 \nis  contemplated  on  the  basis  that  aggregate  approved  percentage  of  retroactive \nfinancing and outstanding advance financing shall not exceed 60% of the loan amount. \nA number of vaccine purchase agreements have already been signed by Bio Farma and \nIndofarma (Table 3). \nDisbursement   Disbursement of the loan proceeds will follow ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between Bio \nFarma and ADB.  \nSources: ADB and Bio Farma. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s standard due diligence requirements for processing sovereign operations have \nbeen applied. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n28.  Economic analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis, \ncausing loss of lives and a major economic downturn. The achievement of herd immunity from \nCOVID-19 through vaccination will allow the resumption of economic activities that generate jobs \nand build human capital, and promote trade and investment domestically and internationally. \n \n29.  Financial analysis.57 Bio Farma is financially strong and capable of absorbing the \nadditional debt to be incurred to finance vaccine purchases. Financial covenants covering debt\u2013\nequity, current, and debt service coverage ratios are included in the loan agreement with Bio \nFarma for monitoring and compliance during project implementation. Indofarma, however, may \nencounter challenges in managing its debts once it borrows from Bio Farma to purchase vaccines \n \n57  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n \n ", "12   \nfrom the Serum Institute of India because of the large size of the loan relative to Indofarma\u2019s \nequity base. Under the financial management action plan, ADB will require quarterly submission \nof debt\u2013equity, current, and debt service coverage ratios at Indofarma and consolidated group \nlevels for monitoring purposes.58  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n30.  Financial management. Based on the assessment, it is concluded that the overall pre-\nmitigated financial management risk of the project is substantial, partly because of Bio Farma\u2019s \nlack of experience in managing and administering projects funded by international financing \ninstitutions and the extraordinary scale of COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution. \nActions identified to mitigate risk include (i) supporting Bio Farma and Indofarma with a financial \nmanagement consultant; (ii) providing training to accounting and finance staff of Bio Farma and \nIndofarma on ADB\u2019s financial management and disbursement guidelines and policies; (iii) using \nthe One Data system to track vaccines and monitor implementation; (iv) ensuring independent \ninternal audit, oversight, and supervision by Indonesia\u2019s Central Financial and Development \nSupervisory Agency; and (v) annual audits conducted by Indonesia\u2019s Supreme Audit Agency.  \n \n31.  Procurement.59 Bio Farma and Indofarma have experience procuring vaccines from \ninternational vaccine suppliers. In 2020, Bio Farma and Indofarma bilaterally negotiated and \nsigned agreements with AstraZeneca Indonesia and Sinovac Life Sciences, and with the Serum \nInstitute of India, respectively, to purchase COVID-19 vaccines. These existing agreements were \nreviewed, and findings documented by ADB (footnote 59). Procurement risk is assessed as \nmedium, as ADB\u2019s support is based on its review of the existing, and any future, bilaterally \nnegotiated agreements, to ensure compliance with the APVAX policy including the vaccine \neligibility criteria. The scale of procurement by Indofarma under the project is significantly larger \nthan its regular operation. To address possible resource constraints at Indofarma, Bio Farma will \nprovide administrative and logistical support as required.  \n \n32.  Anticorruption. Integrity due diligence was completed in respect of Bio Farma and \nIndofarma, and no significant integrity risks were identified. ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  Bio  Farma,  and \nIndofarma. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM \n(footnote 55). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Key poverty and social issues.60 The project will have positive social benefits by \nincreasing the availability of vaccines and the chance for the population to be immunized, resulting \nin better health outcomes and enabling people to restore livelihoods, increase productivity, and \nimprove economic outcomes. Vulnerable men and women will be prioritized for vaccination in line \nwith the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization equity principles (para. 9). \nBio Farma employees, particularly women, will benefit from upskilling and certification through the \nproject.  \n \n \n58  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Financial ratios \nwill be calculated based on definitions set forth in the loan agreement. \n59  Strategic Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n60  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  13 \n34.  Gender. The project is categorized as some gender elements, considering Bio Farma\u2019s \ncommitment to undertake actions that benefit women. It seeks to accelerate progress in gender \nequality by supporting greater participation of women for skills development and certification in \nlogistics system management, a nontraditional profession for women in Indonesia. Further actions \nwill be identified during project implementation. ADB will recruit a gender and social inclusion \nspecialist to support Bio Farma\u2019s implementation and reporting on gender actions through the \ncollection and analysis of disaggregated data where appropriate. The government will ensure that \nwomen and all vulnerable population groups receive vaccinations in line with the VAP.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nare as follows.61 \n \n36.  Environment (category C). The administration of COVID-19 vaccines will result in a \ntemporary increase in immunization waste. Immunization waste management is stipulated in \nMinister Decrees 56/201562 and 18/2020,63 and technical guidelines (footnote 23). Current and \nplanned arrangements for the collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of incremental \nmedical waste were reviewed and confirmed to be adequate.  \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. None of the project activities will involve land acquisition and \ninvoluntary resettlement, and thus no resettlement plan is required for the project. In the event \ninvoluntary resettlement issues are identified during project implementation, a specific mitigation \nplan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is classified category C for indigenous \npeoples safeguards, and there is no need to prepare an indigenous peoples plan. Indigenous \npeoples\u2019 culture, beliefs, and livelihood systems will not be negatively affected by the project.   \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n39.  Considering that risks and required mitigation measures will evolve as vaccines continue \nto be rolled out, ADB will work with Bio Farma, Indofarma, MOH, other relevant ministries and \nagencies, other development partners, and civil society organizations to monitor vaccination \nprogram rollout.
