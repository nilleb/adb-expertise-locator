INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program to promote connectivity, competitiveness, \nand  community.  While  physical  connectivity  in  the  GMS  has  improved  significantly,  weak \ninstitutional  and  operating  capacity  to  facilitate  cross-border  trade  has  constrained  the \ntransformation of transport corridors into economic corridors. \n \n2.  In 2010, the Government of Japan launched a trade facilitation initiative, the Asia Cargo \nHighway (ACH), and provided ADB with a $25 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction to support coordinated assistance for customs administrations in Asia. The objective \nof the ACH is to promote the seamless flow of goods within and outside Asia. The ACH involves \nfour development partner institutions: (i) ADB; (ii) the Customs and Tariff Bureau, Ministry of \nFinance, Japan (CTB-MOF); (iii) the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); and (iv) \nthe World Customs Organization (WCO). The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nmember states endorsed the ACH in 2011.1 In coordination with the CTB-MOF, JICA, and WCO, \nADB subsequently provided initial technical assistance (TA) under the ACH to conduct a series \nof time release studies at border crossings in five GMS countries: Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.2 \n \n3.  The regional policy and advisory TA builds on these ongoing ACH initiatives and broader \nADB support for transport and trade facilitation (TTF) in the GMS. The TA is consistent with \nADB\u2019s development agenda for regional integration under the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \nas well as ADB efforts to support private sector development.3 The concept paper for the TA \nwas approved in January 2013, and ADB fielded fact-finding missions to Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam in May\u2013August 2013. The five GMS countries indicated \nstrong demand and support for the TA to strengthen trade facilitation through partnerships \nbetween customs administrations and the private sector. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The GMS Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022 prioritizes \nthe development of major GMS transport corridors into economic corridors, and emphasizes \nthat improvements in TTF are essential for the transformation process. The framework also \nhighlights the importance of enhancing private sector participation and investment in developing \neconomic corridors.5 The GMS Business Forum, a joint initiative of the chambers of commerce \nof the GMS countries, emphasized at the Third GMS Economic Corridors Forum in June 2011 \n                                                \n1  At the ASEAN\u2013Japan Customs Directors General and Commissioners Meeting on Trade Facilitation in Phnom \nPenh, Cambodia, 28\u201329 April 2011. \n2  ADB. 2012.

In the five GMS member countries, which are also members of ASEAN, the customs \nadministrations are working with other ASEAN member countries to upgrade the quality of their \nservices.  Such  efforts  focus  on  modernizing,  streamlining,  and  harmonizing  complicated \ncustoms and other trade-related procedures and documentation requirements which, taken \ntogether,  impose  significant  transaction  costs  on  the  private  sector  involved  in  trade.  On \naverage, more documents and time are required to export and import in the five GMS countries \nthan  in  other  ASEAN  member  countries. 6  Therefore,  the  performance  of  customs \nadministrations in the GMS still lags other ASEAN member countries.7 \n \n6.  While  customs  administrations  are  responsible  for  the  clearance  of  goods  crossing \nborders, the private sector plays an increasingly important role in trade facilitation services. The \ntrade-related  private  sector  has  identified  a  number  of  ways  to  improve  cargo  clearance \nprocedures at the borders. In recognition of the trade-related private sector\u2019s interests and \ncontributions to TTF, the GMS Freight Transport Association was established in 2012 as a \nsubsidiary body of the GMS Business Forum to highlight TTF issues and help identify solutions. \n \n7.  The core message from private sector agents engaged in cross-border trade (such as \nimporters,  exporters,  freight  forwarders,  customs  brokers,  port  operators,  and  warehouse \noperators, collectively referred to as the trade-related private sector) is that customs formalities \nremain the major impediment to improved logistics and efficient supply chains. Another common \ncomplaint is the lack of business-friendly information about customs procedures, regulations, \nand standards. These issues are very relevant for the five GMS countries as they seek to \nfacilitate  trade  with  other  ASEAN  member  countries,  and  try  to  enhance  subregional \nconnectivity through the development of economic corridors. \n \n8.  Surveys of the trade-related private sector have proved to be an effective means to \nmeasure  the  efficiency  of  trade  at  border-crossing  points,  and  identify  areas  in  need  of \nimprovement. 8  However,  because  business  perception  indexes  are  typically  aggregate \nindicators, they do not provide solutions to specific trade facilitation constraints or bottlenecks. \nSurveys  of  the  trade-related  private  sector  must  move  beyond  identifying  what  needs \nimprovement, to identifying how trade efficiency can be improved. Solutions to trade facilitation \nconstraints  or  bottlenecks  can  range  from  improved  information  and  communication,  to \nstreamlined systems and procedures, to the introduction of new technologies. The private sector \nis an important source of fresh ideas and proposals on these areas. \n \n                                                \n6  World  Bank.  2013.  Doing  Business  2014.  http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/ \nDoing%20Business/Documents/Annual-Reports/English/DB14-Full-Report.pdf. The average number of documents \nrequired to export in the five GMS countries is 7.4 and for import 8.2, and in the other ASEAN member countries \n4.4 for export and 5.4 for import. The average time required to export in the five GMS countries is 21 days and \nimport 22.2 days, and in other ASEAN member countries 13.6 days for export and 12.8 for import. \n7  World  Bank.  2014.

The identification of trade facilitation solutions is also a function of who is surveyed. In \nthe survey design, inputs must be solicited from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \nengaged in cross-border trade. SMEs are often most directly impacted by complex customs \nprocedures  and  inadequate  support  services.  While  customs  administrations  in  the  GMS \ncountries do disseminate information such as customs legislation, procedures, and guidelines \nthrough their websites, further clarification is often needed to ensure that the trade-related \nprivate  sector,  especially  SMEs,  can  achieve  compliance  efficiently  and  effectively.  In  this \nregard, forging better partnerships and communication channels with SMEs can help facilitate \ntrade. \n \n10.  One framework for strengthening partnerships and communication between customs \nadministrations  and  the  trade-related  private  sector  is  the  WCO\u2019s  SAFE  (Security  and \nFacilitation in a Global Environment) Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global \nTrade. Its customs-to-business initiative includes the trusted traders program and the authorized \neconomic operator (AEO) scheme under which simplified customs procedures are provided for \ntraders who verify their ability to comply with customs procedures, regulations, and standards. \nThe introduction of compliance-based programs and trader accreditation programs has gained \nmomentum since 2005, and established AEO programs are now seeking to formalize AEO \nmutual recognition agreements with other customs administrations. \n \n11.  Among the GMS ASEAN member countries, Thailand introduced an AEO scheme in \nJanuary 2013 for exporters, importers, and customs brokers; and Viet Nam initiated a customs \ncompliance program (Priority Enterprise) in June 2011.9 While Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and \nMyanmar have not yet developed a trusted traders program or an AEO scheme, customs \nadministrations  in  the  three  countries  recognize  the  TTF  benefits  of  forging  stronger \npartnerships with the trade-related private sector. In a recent assessment of AEO programs \naround the world, WCO concludes that partnership programs allow customs to achieve more \nwith less effort and ensure sustainable and long-term compliance through incentives such as \nreduced control, periodic reporting, deferred payment, and reputational benefits. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  For the five participating GMS ASEAN member countries, the expected impact is that \npartnerships are forged between customs administrations and the trade-related private sector, \nthereby facilitating the cross-border movement of goods along economic corridors. The impact \nwill be measured by an increase in the number of AEOs and compliant traders established and \nrecognized  by  customs  administrations  in  the  five  GMS  countries.  The  outcome  will  be \nestablished  or  strengthened  schemes  and  measures  for  customs  administrations  to  better \ncoordinate with the private sector for more effective trade facilitation. The expected outcome \nwould  be  demonstrated  by  increased  capacity  of  customs  administrations  to  engage  and \ncoordinate  with  the  trade-related  private  sector  through  outreach  activities  and  improved \ninformation-sharing including accreditation programs, websites, booklets, and help desks; and \nimplementation and strengthening of partnership initiatives between customs administrations \nand the private sector, including trusted traders programs and AEO schemes. \n                                                \n9  World Customs Organization. 2014.

Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The expected outcome will be achieved through the delivery of two outputs: (i) trade \nfacilitation constraints and solutions identified via surveys of the trade-related private sector, and \n(ii) capacity and procedures of customs administrations improved to enable more effective \npartnership and engagement with the trade-related private sector.  \n \n14.  Output 1: Trade facilitation constraints and solutions identified via surveys of the \ntrade-related  private  sector.  Business  perception  surveys  (BPSs)  will  be  conducted  at  \n12 selected border checkpoints along the GMS corridors to identify trade facilitation constraints \nand  solutions  from  the  perspective  of  the  trade-related  private  sector.10 The  BPS  will  be \nconducted in cooperation with the national chambers of commerce, GMS Freight Transport \nAssociation, and other relevant business associations, and specific target agents of the trade-\nrelated  private  sector.  The  BPS  will  focus  on  identifying  constraints  in  border-crossing \nprocedures, both under the customs\u2019 purview and under the private sector\u2019s responsibility. \nEqually  important,  the  BPS  will  seek  solutions  to  these  constraints  and  suggestions  for \nstrengthening partnerships and communication between customs administrations and the trade-\nrelated  private  sector.  The  surveys  will  take  into  account:  (i)  the  actual  conditions  and \nrequirements for securing necessary clearances at border checkpoints, (ii) the role of various \nagents in the trade-related private sector, and (iii) the available results of time release studies at \nthe selected border checkpoints. The findings will be validated with customs administrations and \nthe private sector, and measures recommended to address the identified constraints to facilitate \ncross-border trade and strengthen partnerships with the trade-related private sector. Country \nworkshops will be organized by customs administrations to (i) share the BPS findings and \nrecommendations to address constraints to trade facilitation, and (ii) promote collaboration and \npartnership with the trade-related private sector in implementing proposed solutions. \n \n15.  Output  2:  Capacity  and  procedures  of  customs  administrations  improved  to \nenable more effective partnership and engagement with the trade-related private sector. \nBased on the findings from the BPSs, the TA will provide support for customs administrations to \nengage more effectively with the trade-related private sector by (i) improving the dissemination \nof  information  on  custom  procedures  and  the  provision  of  support  services,  and  \n(ii) strengthening partnerships through customs compliance programs and trader accreditation \nprograms. For information-sharing, support will focus on preparing and disseminating business-\nfriendly information about customs compliance requirements, including valuation, classification, \npreferential treatment, and clearance processes. Such information will be disseminated through \nvarious means, including the websites of customs administrations, booklets in local languages, \nthe establishment of help desks on customs matters, and outreach sessions for dialogue. To \nstrengthen  partnerships,  the  existing  AEO  schemes  and  customs  compliance  programs  in \nThailand and Viet Nam will be enhanced or upgraded based on international standards and best \npractices. Advisory support will be provided to assist these countries in providing the foundation \nfor mutual recognition agreements with other customs administrations. For Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, and Myanmar, support will be provided to develop and implement trader accreditation \nprograms, which can serve as building blocks for the introduction of AEO schemes. WCO \nstandards  and  guidelines  will  be  used  to  help  develop  these  programs,  including  the \napplications  for  traders  to  be  accredited.  Guidelines  and  capacity-building  support  will  be \n                                                \n10 The  12  proposed  checkpoints  are  (i)  Bavet,  Cambodia;  (ii)  Poipet,  Cambodia;  (iii)  Dansavanh,  Lao  PDR;  \n(iv) Kaysone Phomvihane, Lao PDR; (v) Myawaddy, Myanmar; (vi) Tachileik, Myanmar; (vii) Aranyapraphet, \nThailand; (viii) Mae Sai, Thailand; (ix) Mae Sot, Thailand; (x) Mukdahan, Thailand; (xi) Lao Bao, Viet Nam; and  \n(xii) Moc Bai, Viet Nam. ", "5 \n \nprovided to ensure effective implementation of the accreditation programs, particularly in the \nareas of risk management and compliance-based audit. Finally, a regional workshop will be \norganized to promote regional dialogue between customs and the trade-related private sector \non longer-term trade facilitation issues and solutions in the GMS. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented from 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2016. ADB will be the \nexecuting agency with the Southeast Asia Department as the focal point. ADB will work closely \nwith customs administrations in the five participating GMS countries, as well as with the country \nrepresentatives of the GMS Business Forum and the national chambers of commerce. Close \ncoordination will be maintained with institutions supporting Japan\u2019s trade facilitation initiative, \nnamely CTB-MOF, JICA and WCO. \n \n18.  A  total  of  106  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  for  the  TA \ncomprising 21 person-months of international and 85 person-months of national consulting. \nInternational  consulting  inputs  include  16  person-months  for  a  team  leader  and  customs \nspecialist who will design and carry out the BPSs, analyze the results, and design and conduct \nthe capacity-building activities; and 5 person-months for resource persons who will participate in \ncapacity-building activities and regional dialogue between customs and the trade-related private \nsector. National consulting inputs comprise 65 person-months for five trade facilitation country \nspecialists who will provide country-specific support to implement the TA in the participating \nGMS  countries  and  20  person-months  for  a  project  administrator.  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants on an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline of terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  ADB review missions will regularly monitor and report on the progress of major activities \nunder the TA. TA progress will be reported to the GMS countries through the GMS ministerial \nconference, the GMS Economic Corridors Forum, other GMS-related meetings, and national \nand regional meetings to be held under the TA. The major activities, good practices, and \nlessons  from  the  TA  will  be  documented  and  disseminated  through  the  GMS  website \nmaintained by ADB.11 \n \nIV.
