INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Country Programming Mission in 1994 the Government of the Republic\nof the Philippines (the Government) requested advisory technical assistance (TA) to prepare a\ntransport master plan for the island of Mindanao. Subsequent discussions between the\nGovernment and the Bank indicated that transport projects are prioritized based on an outdated\nstrategic analysis undertaken at the national level and completed in 1983. The economic growth\nin recent years has led to large increases in the demand for transport and has created the need\nto ensure that existing strategy addresses the future requirements for transport infrastructure to\nfacilitate economic growth and social development over the longterm. In July 1995, during a\nFact-Finding Mission it was agreed that the preparation of a national transport strategy to guide\ndevelopment of the transport sector over the longterm was high priority. Following discussions\nbetween the Bank and the Government, an understanding was reached on the objectives, scope,\nand cost of the TA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. While almost 13 percent of the Philippine population reside in Metropolitan Manila,\nthe majority are dispersed among the major island groups of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.\nGrowth in gross domestic product in the decade prior to 1990 was erratic, averaging only 1 .6\npercent per annum. The bulk of the economic activity centered upon the national capital region,\nwhich accounted for about 31 percent of gross domestic product in 1990. Since 1990 economic\ngrowth has accelerated and has attained an average of about 5 percent per annum over the past\ntwo years.\n3. The National Transport Planning Project estimated that 53 percent of ton\nkilometers of freight transport in the Philippines in 1987 was carried by road transport, 47 percent\nby water transport, and negligible shares by rail and air transport. In the case of passenger\ntransport, an even higher 89 percent of passenger-kilometers of travel was made by road, 9\npercent by water transport, 2 percent by air, and a negligible proportion by rail. As travel is a\nderived demand, the revival of economic growth in the Philippines has resulted in rapid growth\nin travel demand. The increased demand coupled with the relative poor quality of the network\nfacilities is placing considerable constraints upon transport infrastructure and services. The low\nlevel of service provided by existing facilities inhibits economic and social activity, particularly in\nthe less developed rural areas.\n4. The length of the road network in the Philippines has remained relatively\nunchanged during the past 15 years, and there is a comprehensive system of ports and airports.\nThe rail line in southern Luzon is being rehabilitated. Hence, the backbone of the transport\nnetwork in the country is largely in place and is generally able to accommodate current demand.\nThe clear exception is in some urban areas, Metro Manila in particular. Other general exceptions\ninclude a need for additional roads to improve accessibility to isolated areas on the eastern coast\nof Luzon, additional cross-island roads to improve connections between major towns and\nThe TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities in July 1995.\n.\t -I", "2\nagricultural production areas in Mindanao, and, in some locations, additional penetration roads\nto areas with agricultural potential.\n5. While the extent of fixed transport infrastructure is largely in place, it is commonly\nin poor condition. The capacity of some infrastructure facilities needs to be expanded to\naccommodate future growth in transport demand and technological developments. The\nintegrated planning and coordination of these improvements must be facilitated to ensure that\ntheir capacity is suitable and timing appropriate. The organization of Government responsibilities\nin the transport sector is generally well-developed. The Department of Public Works and\nHighways (DPWH) is responsible for the national road system. The Toll Regulatory Board is\nattached to the DPWH. The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) is\nresponsible for transport planning and policy in general, for administration and regulation of the\nsector, and for the development and operation of the national system of fixed air and maritime\ninfrastructure. Many of DOTC's activities are undertaken by agencies that are directly or\nultimately responsible to it, including the Air Transportation Office, Civil Aeronautics Board,\nairport authorities for the Manila and Cebu airports, Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA),\nPhilippine Ports Authority, Philippine National Railways, Land Transportation Office, and Land\nTransportation Franchising and Regulatory Board.\n6. With the exception of some regulatory powers in the PPA, most regulatory and\noperational responsibilities are now located in separate agencies. Liberalization of entry to the\ntransport industry and deregulation of tariffs has commenced, in particular in the shipping and\naviation industry, with the objective of improving efficiency, promoting industry development, and\nproviding new and improved services. There remain opportunities to extend and enhance this\nprocess. The Government also envisages a substantial role for private sector funding of fixed\ntransport infrastructure.\n7. In practice, planning of transport infrastructure development occurs on a sectoral\nbasis. Medium-and long-term plans are largely based on occasional landmark studies. Policy,\nstrategy, and institutional issues are addressed to varying degrees in the course of these and\nother studies. Examples of some recent studies include: (i) Civil Aviation Master Plan (1992);\n(ii) Roll-on Roll-off Transport System Development Study (1992); (iii) Master Plan Study on Luzon\nIsland Strategic Road Network Development Project (1993); (iv) Philippine National Railways\nPrivatization Study (1993); (v) Greater Capital Region Integrated Port Development Study (1994);\n(vi) Philippine Road Classification Study (1994); (vii) Study on Commercialization Options for the\nPhilippine Port Sector (1995); and (viii) Philippine Ports Authority 25-Year Development Plan\n(1995).\n8. The sectoral and occasional nature of these studies results in a tendency for the\nfollowing:\n(I) lntersectoral linkages have not been fully taken into account. For example,\nplanning of ports and port access roads may not be integrated. Similarly,\nalternative strategies such as upgrading several neighboring ports or, say, only\none port and improving road linkages between the ports are commonly not\nundertaken.", "3\n(ii) Plans may be prepared on different bases. For example, different forecasts of\ntransport demand and different planning horizons may be used by different\nagencies. However, increasing use is being made of the Government's medium-\nterm development plan, which is limited to the 1993-1 998 period.\n(iii) Plans commonly do not take into account financing constraints and opportunities\nin the transport sector as a whole and possible resource availability from private\nand nontraditional sources is not addressed systematically and in an integrated\nmanner.\nThe studies do, however, provide important repositories of information and analysis that serve\nan ongoing role in supporting policy formulation and change by the Government as well as\ninfrastructure planning.\n9. Relatively little attention has been given in recent years to strategic transport\nplanning in the Philippines. However, a current activity for long-term planning for the transport\nsector will involve senior Government and non-government people in the formulation and\ndevelopment of a vision and guiding principles for the future development and management of\ntransport in the country. This activity will not be based upon rigorous analytical study but will\ndepend upon existing sources of information and desk studies.\n10. Other studies that are currently planned include (i) a road network study for the\nVisayas and Mindanao (expected to commence in early 1996 with JICA assistance); (b)\nCost-Recovery of Infrastructure Facilities and Services of PAGASA and MARINA (to be\nundertaken by consultants to the National Economic Development authority (NEDA) in 1995);\nand (c) Identification and Privatization of Basic Transport Infrastructure and Services (by NEDA).\n11. The presence of a number of recent sectoral studies, together with the need to\ncommence planning for the next medium-term development plan period (1 999-2004), provides\nan appropriate occasion to draw together and develop this previous work into an integrated,\nprioritized program of investment in the transport infrastructure network. The focus of the TA will\nbe on the transport network for which the Government is directly responsible. Other than the\nreview of linkages to ports, airports, railway terminals, and intercity highways, urban transport\nrequirements will be addressed because of their special needs and complexity. Project will be\nprioritized based on their social and environmental features, economic and technical factors, and\nconsideration of alternative strategies for development of the transport network. There is a more\ngeneral need to review alternative transport policies and strategies to provide a clear indication\nof options available to the Government and the implications of continuing the current policies or\nadopting alternative approaches. The study will also consider possible future sources of funding.\nIt will identify the potential role for private financing of transport infrastructure and alternative\nstrategies to seek and secure this funding. Finally, the study will contribute to the development\nof intersectoral agency cooperation and transport planning, and will examine the need for further\ninstitutional reform.\n12. The TA will promote the Bank's strategy of facilitating institutional development\nand training by involving private and public sector personnel in the development and application\nof methodological and analytical techniques for integrated transport planning and policy analysis.\nThe TA will also promote the Government's strategy of enhancing the effectiveness of\ninfrastructure planning and improving the efficiency of the transport sector over the longterm.\nI .,..\t -\t ,\t .\t -\t .\t .\t .\t - -", "4\nIII. THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n13. The TA will help the Government prepare a comprehensive, integrated plan for the\ndevelopment of an efficient and effective intercity transport system to support the national\neconomic growth and social development objectives of the Government. The TA will build on\nand integrate the results and work of past and other ongoing studies of the transport sector in\nthe Philippines.\nB. Scope\n14. The TA will review existing sources of data and proposals to prepare  a\ncomprehensive transport strategy for the Philippines. The TA will cover all modes of transport\nand will focus on nonurban travel needs and facilities. It will review linkages in urban areas to\nports, airports, railway terminals, and intercity highways.\n15. The TA will determine a consistent basis for estimating future transport demand\non which the scope and priority of projects can be assessed. It will review current transport\nsector project and program proposals, review other needs, and prepare  an integrated,\ncomprehensive infrastructure investment program for the period to 2010, with particular focus\non the period to 2004 corresponding to the next medium-term planning period. Linkages\nbetween projects and the sensitivity of the scope and priority of projects to alternative scenarios\nwill be identified. Project will be prioritized based on economic, financial, technical,\nenvironmental, and social criteria. The TA will identify the potential for private sector funding of\nprojects and other means for improving the mobilization of financial resources to fund\ninfrastructure maintenance and development.\n16. The TA will incorporate a review of sectoral policies to ensure that they promote\nefficiency and enhance services over the long term, address social issues, support poverty\nalleviation, and minimize adverse environmental impacts. The TA will also review current\ninstitutional arrangements to ascertain their appropriateness over the longterm. The conduct of\nthe TA should promote intersectoral coordination and institutional development. The terms of\nreference for the services are presented in Appendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1 090,000 equivalent, consisting of\n$801 000 equivalent in foreign exchange and $289,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The\nGovernment of France has agreed to provide $1 ,000,000 to meet the entire foreign exchange\nand $199,000 of equivalent local costs on a grant basis. The remainder of the local currency\ncosts of $90,000 will be met by the Government of the Philippines. The cost estimates for the\nTA and the proposed financing arrangements are shown in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n18. A team of internationally-recruited experts in association with domestic consultants\nwill be engaged to undertake the TA. This will ensure that the various tasks under the TA are\naccomplished satisfactorily and in a timely and cost-effective manner, and that skills development", "5\nand transfer occur. The TA will require about 64 person-months of consulting services,\ncomprising about 29 person-months of international consulting services and about 35\nperson-months of domestic consulting services. The international consulting services required\nwill be in the fields of transport planning, transport economics, transport policy analysis, and\nenvironmental planning, and will contain specific expertise in the road, aviation, maritime, and\nrail subsectors as well as financial evaluation and financing of transport infrastructure. The\nexpertise required from local consultants will include transport planning, transport economics,\ntransport policy analysis, highway engineering, and environmental planning. To provide the\nservices for the TA, an international firm of consultants in association with local consultants will\nbe selected and engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n19. The major portion of the work will be undertaken over an 11-month period\nconcluding with the submission of a draft final report to the Government and Bank. The reports\nwill describe the work undertaken, including a transport investment strategy and proposals for\npolicy and institutional development. Seven other technical reports will be prepared during the\ncourse of the TA (see Appendix 1) to provide the opportunity for review of its progress and\nperformance.\n20. NEDA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Inter-Agency Technical\nCommiftee for Transport Planning (IATCTP), which is chaired by NEDA and cochaired by DOTC\nand comprises representatives of DPWH, the Philippine National Railway, MARINA, and PPA, will\ncoordinate and oversee implementation. The IATCTP will meet on at least four occasions to\ndiscuss reports and progress of the TA. NEDA will appoint a full-time Project Director, who will\nbe responsible for guiding the technical work of the TA, supervising Government staff, and\nfacilitating implementation of the TA. The responsible transport agencies will nominate a\nminimum of six full-time counterpart staff to the TA team comprising the following technical\nexpertise: national transport and development planning, transport economics, highway planning,\nport planning and operations, civil aviation, and transport policy formulation. Other expertise,\nsuch as railway planning and operations, environmental and social impact assessment,\neconomic development and financial specialists, will be made available for short-term inputs as\nneeded. The Government will also provide suitable office accommodation and secretaries,\ndraftsmen, and office support staff.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n21. It is considered that the proposed technical assistance to the Government of the\nRepublic of the Philippines in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1 ,000,000 is necessary\nfor the purpose of preparing a Philippine Transport Strategy. This technical assistance will be\nfinanced by the Government of France on a grant basis, and is to be administered by the Bank\nunder the existing cooperation arrangement between the Government of France and the Bank.\nThe proposal for the Bank to administer the assistance is considered appropriate.\n22. The President recommends that the Board approve the Bank acting as\nadministrator of the proposed technical assistance to be financed by the Government of France.\n1 ILWU1K TOl WFCfl tnernrneht is directly responsible.
