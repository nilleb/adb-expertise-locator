The Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management (CACILM) is a partnership \nof  Central  Asian  countries  (CACs)  and  development  cooperation  partners1 dedicated  to \ncombating land degradation and improving rural livelihoods. Based on previous analytical and \nresource mobilization support to the CACs from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \nGlobal Mechanism of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD),2 \nthese partners requested ADB to lead the design and development of CACILM. ADB, through \ntechnical assistance (TA) cofinanced by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Global \nMechanism,3 led the design of CACILM as a 10-year program of country-driven action and \nresource mobilization (July 2006\u2013June 2016)4 to achieve in the CACs (i) strengthened policy, \nlegislative,  and  institutional  frameworks  to  create  conditions  conducive  to  sustainable  land \nmanagement (SLM); (ii) increased capacity in key institutions responsible for planning and \nimplementing SLM interventions; and (iii) improved land management and natural systems \nthrough the combined impact of enabling conditions and targeted project investments. \n \n2.  The design phase produced the CACILM Multicountry Partnership Framework (CMPF), \nwhich guides the activities of the CACILM partnership. The CMPF has been submitted to the \nGEF Council for approval of its overall programmatic approach and the associated set of \nprojects seeking financing from GEF-3 Replenishment resources. Over its 10-year planning \nhorizon, the CMPF is anticipated to require $100.7 million from GEF Replenishments: $20.7 \nmillion (GEF-3), $40.0 million (GEF-4), and $40.0 million (GEF-5). Project Development Facility \n(PDF-B) funding for $700,000 was approved earlier by the GEF secretariat to support the \ndesign of the CMPF. \n \n3.  ADB is responsible for leading the CACILM partnership, coordinating programs at the \nmulticountry  and  national  levels,  and  supporting  activities  at  the  multicountry  level,  which \ninclude developing an SLM information system, knowledge management and dissemination, \nand SLM research. The proposed TA is for necessary support for carrying out these activities \nduring the first phase of the CACILM program.5 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Land degradation\u2014mainly (i) erosion, salinization, and water logging; (ii) deteriorating \nfertility  of  pastureland;  (iii)  decreasing  fertility  of  the  arable  drylands  of  the  steppes;  (iv) \ndecreasing area and productivity of forests; (v) on- and off-site impacts of mining operations; (vi) \n                                                 \n1  The main partners from the CACs are the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Working \nGroups on Partnership Development for UNCCD Implementation and the UNCCD national focal points. The \ndevelopment  cooperation  partners  are  members  of  the  Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  for  UNCCD \nImplementation in the Central Asian Countries (SPA) of the Global Mechanism, Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  CCD  Project  of  the  German  Agency  for  Technical \nCooperation (GTZ), International Center for Agricultural Research on Dry Areas (ICARDA), International Fund for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC),  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The World Bank is \nexpected to join in 2006.  \n2  Support was provided to the CACs for important sector work that developed priorities for action and organized \nresource mobilization efforts through ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Combating Desertification in Asia. \nManila (TA 5941-REG, approved 9 October 2000 with cofinancing from the Global Mechanism). \n3  ADB. 2005.  Technical Assistance for Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management. Manila (TA 6326-\nREG). \n4  While the resource mobilization period is 10 years, the implementation of various investments in the enabling \nenvironment and on-the-ground development will take place over 15 years. \n5  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 13 June 2006. \n ", "2 \nexacerbated risks of landslides and flooding due to poor watershed management; (vii) reduced \nstability  and  functioning  of  desert,  mountain,  wetland,  and  riparian  ecosystems;  and  (viii) \ncontaminated sites from resource extraction and nuclear testing\u2014is a serious economic, social, \nand environmental problem in the transition economies of Central Asia. Agricultural yields have \ndeclined by 20\u201330% across the region since these countries achieved independence, causing \nannual losses of up to $2 billion in agricultural production and seriously harming the livelihood of \nthe rural population.  \n \n5.  The root causes of these problems are inappropriate agricultural and water policies, \nregulations, and incentives; the inability of governments to adopt and implement SLM due to \ntheir  relatively  weak  capacity;  and  a  host  of  environmental  problems  arising  in  part  from \ninadequate, inconsistent, and weakly implemented environmental laws. \n \n6.  The  CACs  have  responded  by  acceding  to  or  ratifying  the  UNCCD  and  preparing \nUNCCD national action plans or programs (NAPs), the Subregional Action Program for Central \nAsian  Countries  on  Combating  Desertification  and  Drought  (SRAP-CD),  and  national \nenvironmental  action  plans  and  a  regional  environmental  action  plan  that  gives  prominent \nattention to drought and desertification. However, the NAPs lack (i) a participatory approach, (ii) \nstrong problem analysis, (iii) adequate discussion of policy implications, (iv) strong linkages with \nnational  planning  and  budgetary  processes,  and  (v)  structural  interactions  between  CAC \ngovernments  and  development  cooperation  partners.  These  problems  have  stalled \nimplementation of the NAPs and SRAP-CD. \n \n7.  CACILM was designed to overcome these problems through a coordinated program of \nnational  and  multicountry  activities  that  will  create  an  enabling  policy  and  institutional \nenvironment for SLM and strengthen the capacity of CACs to develop and implement SLM.  \n \n8.  The Global Environment Facility has been active in land degradation issues in the CACs. \nTo improve the impact of its investments, GEF felt that a multicountry pilot partnership under the \nGEF  Country  Pilot  Partnerships  (CPP)  program  was  desirable.  CACILM  entered  the  GEF \npipeline as a multicountry CPP in May 2004, and a PDF-B grant to elaborate the design of \nCACILM  was  approved  in  February  2005.  Combining  the  CPP  concept\u2014which  caters  to \ncountries\u2019 needs in a holistic way for the long timeframe needed to reverse land degradation\u2014\nwith a partnership of virtually all the major development cooperation partners active in Central \nAsia offers the best chance for the CACs to resolve their land degradation problems in a \nmanner that will result in extensive global environmental benefits.  \n9.  The CMPF is a 10-year program of national and multicountry activities to improve the \nproductivity of land in the CACs and the economic well-being of those who depend on the land. \nThe  national  activities  are  sets  of  priority  capacity-building  and  on-the-ground  investments \nemanating from national programming frameworks (NPFs) developed under CACILM.  \n10.  At the multicountry level, two projects are central to the successful outcome of the \noverall CMPF programmatic approach. These are the CMPF Support Project (the subject of this \nTA)  and  a  multicountry  capacity-building  project  to  be  funded  separately.  The  CMPF  will \nundertake (i) support for implementing the NPFs, (ii) multicountry activities, and (iii) program \ncoordination. \n \n11.  The CMPF Support Project is necessary to achieve the strategic objectives of CACILM. \nWithout  support  for  continuing  multicountry  activities,  the  national  activities  will  revert  to \nindependent, uncoordinated projects, losing economies of scale and increasing transaction \ncosts for donor agencies. There would be less, if any, coordination of GEF and non-GEF \n ", "  3\nactivities  in  land  degradation.  The  likely  result  would  be  lost  motivation  and  political  will. \nStakeholders would participate less in planning and implementation, incentives would be limited \nfor further expanding cooperation among development cooperation partners, and motivation \nwould be reduced for refocusing assistance programs on land degradation. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  of  the  CMPF  is  expected  to  be  the  restoration,  maintenance,  and \nenhancement of the productivity of land in the CACs, improving the economic and social well-\nbeing of those who depend on these resources, while preserving the environmental functions of \nthe land. Partnership framework support is needed to coordinate and integrate the national \nactivities.  \n13.  The  CMPF  has  six  programmatic  outcomes:  (i)  a  favorable  environment  for  SLM \ninvestments  in  CACs,  supported  by  SLM  mainstreaming  and  improvements  in  policies, \nregulations, and land administration; (ii) improved institutional capacity in the CACs to adopt \nintegrated land-use planning and management; (iii) the rehabilitation and improved productivity \nof selected lands, leading to improved livelihoods, foreign exchange earnings, and food security, \nand  providing  indirect  protection  to  threatened  ecosystems;  (iv)  enhanced  protection  of \necosystem  integrity  and  landscapes;  (v)  broader  involvement  of  civil  society  and  other \nstakeholders in SLM; and (vi) long-term, sustained, and harmonized commitments of financial \nand human resources by mainstreaming SLM in development cooperation partner programs.  \n14.  The  CMPF  Support  Project  contributes  to  two  of  the  above  outcomes\u2014improved \ninstitutional capacity and long-term, sustained, and harmonized commitments of financial and \nhuman resources\u2014that are vital in achieving the other outcomes.  \n \n15.  The outputs of the CMPF Support Project will be (i) a sustainable land management \ninformation system (SLMIS) designed, developed, and operated; (ii) a knowledge management \nplan developed and the first set of knowledge products disseminated; (iii) an SLM research \nprogram designed and implemented; (iv) the strategic development of the CMPF, promotion of \npolicy  dialogue,  and  efficient  and  effective  coordination  of  CMPF  implementation;  (v)  and \nefficient and effective coordination of NPF implementation. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The outputs above will contribute to the improved capacity outcome by providing the \nknowledge and information needed to underpin the adoption of SLM and to the long-term \ncommitments outcome by providing an enabling environment that will promote mainstreaming \nSLM, in both national and development cooperation partners\u2019 planning and budgeting.  \n \n17.  The  multicountry  activities  will  bring  improved  capacity  to  support  policy  dialogue, \nstrengthen institution building to make efficient investments that generate global benefits, and \nstore and disseminate the requisite knowledge that will form the basis of a common approach \nand integration of activities toward SLM. There are three main types of multicountry activities: (i) \nthe design, development, testing, and deployment of an SLMIS, (ii) a program of integrative \nSLM research, and (iii) the development of a knowledge management plan and information \ndissemination. A fourth set of multicountry capacity-building activities is considered sufficiently \nimportant  to  warrant  focused  attention  through  a  separate  but  linked  project,  as  noted  in \n ", "4 \nparagraph 10. The CACILM steering committee and secretariat at the multicountry level, as well \nas the national coordination councils and secretariats, will coordinate CMPF activities. The \nmajor program coordination activities will be to establish multicountry and national units for \nprogram coordination and management, as well as project monitoring and evaluation systems.   \n \n18.  Program implementation will be in three phases: (i) inception, focusing on capacity \nbuilding, from 1 July 2006 to 31 December 2008; (ii) full implementation, mainly on-the-ground \ninvestments, from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013; and (iii) consolidation, finalizing \ninstitutional arrangements and disseminating results, from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2016. TA \nwill take place during Phase I with the following key activities: (i) an SLMIS will be designed, \ndeveloped, and made operational, and the land degradation baseline established; (ii) the SLM \nresearch program will be designed and initiated; and (iii) the knowledge management and \ninformation dissemination program will develop a knowledge management plan and initiate \nknowledge generation, capture, and dissemination; and (iv) multicountry and national units for \nprogram  coordination  and  management  will  be  established,  including  necessary  capacity \nbuilding in finance and administration, and project monitoring and evaluation systems will be \ndesigned, developed, and implemented.  \n \n19.  The main assumptions, common to all CACILM activities at all levels, are the continued \ncommitment of CAC governments to a coordinated approach to tackling land degradation within \nand among their countries and to improved economic and environmental governance. More \nspecifically, the assumptions are that (i) fundamental support exists and can be sustained in \ncentral governments for a multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach to dealing with land \ndegradation, (ii) the flow of information from research to extension services and on to farmers\u2019 \nfields is maintained, (iii) the land-reform situation continues to provide incentives for farmers to \nadopt SLM, (iv) donors can make commitments beyond their normal programming cycle, and (v) \ndonor programs will place increasingly high priority on SLM in the short term and maintain that \npriority in the long term. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The total cost of the CMPF Support Project is $6.325 million equivalent. Funds directly \nadministered by ADB under TA are estimated at $4.025 million, which will be financed on grant \nbasis by the Global Environment Facility ($3.025 million), the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment (IFAD) ($200,000), and the ADB TA funding program ($800,000). Detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \n21.  The CACs will make in-kind contributions totaling $500,000. In addition, the German \nDevelopment Cooperation through the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n(GTZ, or German Agency for Technical Cooperation) will provide parallel financing of $300,000. \nIn-kind contributions will be made by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) ($300,000) \nand the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) ($500,000). ADB \nTA 4375-KAZ: Environmental Monitoring and Information Management for Sustainable Land \nUse ($600,000) will be implemented in parallel with this TA. ADB will also provide an in-kind \ncontribution of staff time and travel expenses estimated at $100,000.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  TA will be carried out in the five CACs and have a term of 2.5 years (1 July 2006\u201331 \nDecember  2008).  A  CACILM  steering  committee  responsible  for  coordinating  the  10-year \nprogram will be chaired by ADB and comprise (i) representatives of the governments of the \n ", "  5\nCACs;  (ii)  the  GEF  implementing  agencies  World  Bank,  UNDP,  and  UNEP;  (iii)  the  GEF \nexecuting agencies ADB, FAO, and IFAD; (iv) bilateral agencies; and (v) other participating \ninternational organizations. \n23.  A CACILM secretariat (Appendix 3) will be created to support the CACILM steering \ncommittee and require the services of international consultants (32 person-months) and national \nconsultants (112 person-months). Outline terms of reference for consultants are presented in \nAppendix 4. Consultants will be engaged individually by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers (April 2006) and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of local consultants. Equipment for \nthe CACILM secretariat and the national secretariat offices will be procured according to ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (April 2006). Agreements with FAO and ICARDA are expected to be \nmade for implementing the information system and research components, respectively.  \n \n24.  Coordination will be mainly through national coordination councils and their national \nsecretariats. All major bodies (i.e., the CACILM steering committee and CACILM secretariat, \nnational coordination councils, and national secretariats) will operate under a set of specific \nguidelines and procedures to be developed by the CACILM secretariat under the direction of the \nCACILM steering committee and based mainly on ADB operational guidelines and procedures. \n \n25.  Annual work plan and budgets will be submitted by the national coordination councils \nthrough  the  CACILM  secretariat  to  the  CACILM  steering  committee.  Annual  reports  on \nmulticountry  activities  and  program  coordination  will  be  prepared  and  disseminated  to  all \nstakeholders. In addition, information and knowledge products will be prepared and actively \ndisseminated in forms useful to the different groups of stakeholders.  \n \n26.  To cover operating costs, an advance payment facility, to be replenished on liquidation, \nwill be used to disburse funds to (i) national secretariats; (ii) development cooperation partners \nlike FAO and ICARDA that have partnership agreements with ADB to undertake activities under \nTA,  and  (iii)  the  CACILM  secretariat  office.  The  national  secretariats  and  development \ncooperation partners will be required to maintain accounts that will be audited annually. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n27.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,025,000 for the Central Asian Countries \nInitiative for Land Management Multicountry Partnership Framework Support Project, to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Global Environment Facility.

Background.  The  Central  Asian  Countries  Initiative  for  Land  Management  (CACILM) \nMulticountry Partnership Framework (CMPF) is a mechanism to carry out a 10-year program of \nnational  and  multicountry  activities  with  the  expected  impact  of  restoring,  maintaining,  and \nenhancing the productive functions of land in Central Asia to improve the economic and social well-\nbeing of those who depend on these resources while preserving the environmental functions of \nthese lands. The CMPF has been endorsed by all the major development cooperation partners \nactive in the Central Asian countries (CACs). These partners have confirmed cofinancing for the \nfirst phase of the 10-year CMPF program from 1 July 2006 to 31 December 2008, which is the \nperiod  covered  by  this  technical  assistance.  The  CMPF  has  been  submitted  to  the  Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF) for additional cofinancing. \n \n2.
