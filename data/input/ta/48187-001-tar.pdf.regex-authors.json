INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve the alignment of development partners\u2019 assistance with the \ngovernment\u2019s development priorities and objectives. Capacity development for aid effectiveness \nwas emphasized in the interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132016,1 and the TA was \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.2 A TA fact-finding mission on \n16\u201327 October 2014 reached agreement with the government on the TA impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financial arrangements, and terms of reference \nfor consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Mongolian economy, traditionally based on livestock herding, is experiencing rapid \ntransformation and growth due to the discovery of large mineral deposits and the development \nof the mining industry. While economic growth averaged about 10% over the past decade and \nsubstantially boosted average income, 27.4% of the population still lived below the national \npoverty  line  in  2012.  This  is  largely  because  mineral-led  growth  has  failed  to  generate \nsubstantial employment, with just 4% of the labor force engaged in this sector. \n \n3.  Substantial  public  and  private  investments  in  infrastructure  are  needed  to  support \neconomic growth, diversify the economy, and create jobs, while increasing access for all people \nto  essential  services  like  heat,  power,  health,  education,  housing,  water,  and  sanitation.4 \nMongolia  has  been  able  to  access  international  financial  markets  in  recent  years,  but  it \ncontinues to face serious challenges in project planning, processing, and implementation. \n \n4.  Development  assistance  plays  an  essential  role  in  alleviating  poverty  through  job \ncreation, social protection, environmental protection, and strengthened governance, especially \nto manage burgeoning mining revenues. Because the relative size and concessionality of official \ndevelopment assistance is declining as Mongolia moves towards becoming an upper middle- \nincome  country,  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  these  scarce  resources  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to align development partners\u2019 assistance with its priorities are increasingly \nimportant.5  \n \n5.  The  government  demonstrated  commitment  to  promoting  the  effectiveness  of \ndevelopment cooperation by signing the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness6 (2005) and \nendorsing  the  Busan  Partnership  for  Effective  Development  Co-operation7 (2011),  which \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 December 2014.  \n4  In Ulaanbaatar, peri-urban informal settlements or \u201cger areas\u201d are home to about 60% of residents and virtually not \nserved by the city\u2019s heating, water supply, and sanitation networks. \n5  Increased gross domestic product per capita in recent years has led development partners, including ADB, to \nsubstitute grant financing for lending with increasingly less concessional terms, leading the government to further \nexplore alternative sources of development finance, especially by tapping international financial markets and \nmaking use of its Development Bank of Mongolia. Several bilateral development partners are scaling or shutting \ndown operations in Mongolia. \n6  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2005. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/34428351.pdf \n7  Working  Party  on  Aid  Effectiveness.  2011.  Busan  Partnership  for  Effective  Development  Co-operation. \nhttp://effectivecooperation.org/files/OUTCOME_DOCUMENT_-_FINAL_EN2.pdf \n ", "2  \nestablished  the  Global  Partnership  for  Effective  Development  Co-operation.8 However,  the \ncountry has no mechanisms in place to implement, coordinate, and monitor the commitments \nunder the Busan and Paris declarations. For instance, Mongolia was not yet included in the list \nof countries assessed in the 2014 Global Partnership Monitoring Report.9 \n \n6.  The government\u2019s aid management capacity has been affected by repeated government \nrestructuring. The Ministry of Economic Development (MOED) was created in 2012 and became \nresponsible for planning foreign aid and the counterpart for ADB, together with the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF). As a new agency, MOED struggled severely to build its capacity to plan and \ncoordinate development assistance and develop systems and mechanisms for coordinating with \nthe  MOF,  other  agencies,  development  partners,  and  stakeholders.  Key  government\u2013\ndevelopment  partner  coordination  mechanisms  fell  into  disuse,  including  the  annual \ncoordination meeting chaired by the government and the World Bank, which was discontinued \nin 2012. Successor arrangements are needed to ensure that development assistance is well \ntargeted and effective.  \n \n7.  On 7 October 2014, a bill was passed to reduce the number of ministries from 16 to 13. \nAccording to this bill, the MOED was abolished and its functions were transferred to the MOF \nand the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Economic Cooperation, with the MOF again in charge of \nloan and aid policy. Unfortunately, this occurred with a very limited transfer of responsible \nMOED staff to the MOF, which may result in a further loss of institutional memory. In its short \nexistence, MOED was unable to submit a development assistance policy to Parliament. The \nMOF faces a major challenge to rebuild its aid management capacity and bring Mongolia\u2019s \ndevelopment assistance policies and practices rapidly in line with international best practices. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA impact will be an improved alignment of development partners\u2019 assistance with \nthe government\u2019s development priorities and objectives. The outcome will be the improved \nperformance  of  the  government  to  effectively  plan  and  manage  development  assistance-\nsupported projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will provide support to improve the government\u2019s performance to plan and \nmanage  development  assistance-supported  projects  through  the  following  outputs:  (i)  a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  Mongolia\u2019s  aid  management  against  international  best \npractices\u2014including  Mongolia\u2019s  commitments  under  the  Busan  and  Paris  declarations\u2014\nprepared, resulting in pragmatic recommendations for improvement; (ii) development assistance \npolicy  formulated;  (iii)  effective  government\u2013development  partner  coordination  mechanisms \n                                                \n8  The monitoring framework that tracks progress on the commitments made at the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid \nEffectiveness in Busan was recently discussed at the first ministerial-level meeting of the Global Partnership for \nEffective Development Cooperation in Mexico. Examples of indicators under the Monitoring Framework of the \nGlobal Partnership include (i) proportion of development cooperation funding covered by indicative forward \nspending plans provided at the country level, (ii) percentage of development cooperation funding scheduled for \ndisbursement that is recorded in the annual budgets approved by the legislature, and (iii) use of country public \nfinancial management and procurement systems. \n9  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  2014.  Making  Development  Co-operation  More \nEffective: 2014 Progress Report. http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/development/making-\ndevelopment-co-operation-more-effective_9789264209305-en \n ", "  3\nestablished; and (iv) skills of key government officials in development assistance management \nimproved.10 \n \n10.  Output 1: Aid management assessment prepared. Under this output, the TA will \nproduce a comprehensive aid management assessment to benchmark development assistance \nprocesses  and  procedures  against  international  best  practices,  including  Mongolia\u2019s \ncommitments under the Busan and Paris declarations and the Mexico High Level Meeting \nCommuniqu\u00e9 (footnote 8).11 Based on a detailed assessment, the report will provide pragmatic \nrecommendations to the government for implementing major commitments and enhancing the \neffectiveness and efficiency of development assistance, some of which may be supported by \nthe TA through, for instance, training or workshops. \n \n11.  Output 2: Development assistance policy formulated. Under this output, the TA will \ndraft a detailed development assistance policy in line with international best practices for aid \nmanagement, taking into account medium-term economic prospects for Mongolia, government \ncapacity, and the evolving international development cooperation architecture that highlights the \nimportance  of  nontraditional  development  partners.  In  considering  Mongolia\u2019s  development \nstrategy,  access  to  international  capital  markets,  debt  management  framework,  budgetary \nconstraints, and medium-term public investment plan, the policy would support the alignment of \ndevelopment assistance to the country\u2019s public investment and TA needs. The policy would not \nonly  address  current  needs  and  challenges,  but  also  anticipate  future  requirements  and \npartnerships. The policy could assist the government in, among others, prioritizing sectors and \nthemes for development cooperation (e.g., climate change or health), adequately distinguishing \ninstruments in its financing strategy (e.g., grants or concessional and market-based loans), and \nfacilitating subnational borrowing or onlending, where appropriate.12 \n \n12.  Output  3:  Government\u2013development  partner  coordination  mechanisms \nestablished. Under this output, the TA will establish effective government\u2013development partner \ncoordination  mechanisms  resulting  in  regular  government-led  coordination  meetings  at  the \nnational and/or sector level.13 The TA will help institute effective intergovernmental horizontal \nand  vertical  communication  and  coordination  mechanisms  and  maintain  a  comprehensive \ndevelopment  partner  matrix,  with  possible  coverage  ranging  from  bilateral  and  multilateral \ndevelopment partners to relevant nontraditional partners, such as the private sector and civil \nsociety organizations. \n \n13.  Output  4:  Skills  in  development  assistance  management  improved. Under this \noutput,  the  TA  will  organize  targeted  training,  high-level  workshops,  conferences  and/or \nseminars to improve the skills of key government officials on the effective use and management \nof development assistance, including new global actors and funding sources (e.g., regional and \nglobal  funds,  public\u2013private  partnerships). 14  Eminent  resource  persons  and  international \n                                                \n10  Where possible, the TA intends to align with and build upon the efforts of other bilateral and multilateral \ndevelopment partners (e.g., analysis or existing meeting structures). \n11  This includes, among others, the country's loan and grant initiation, preparation, and approval processes. \n12 The formulation of development assistance policy is crucial given Mongolia\u2019s recent graduation from the status of \ngrant recipient to blend country with increased access to nonconcessional funding. As there is no existing policy, \nthere  is  an  emerging  need  for  a  policy  that  better  guides  official  development  assistance  flows  with  less \nconcessional terms. \n13  There is an opportunity for the government to build on existing development partner meetings, for instance for \nextractive industries. \n14 The program could include staff of the MOF, Economic Development Committee, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and \nEconomic  Cooperation,  Cabinet  Secretariat,  key  line  ministries,  regional  bodies  in  charge  of  planning  and \ndevelopment, and other central and regional agencies. \n ", "4  \nconsultants  will  support  the  events,  which  will  be  organized  in  cooperation  with  active \ndevelopment partners.15 The TA will provide training and practical guidance for government \nofficials on accessing and applying for development finance from international sources, of which \nseveral are largely untapped. Where necessary, the TA could also support experience and \nlearning exchanges from peer countries through conferences, study tours, or exchanges of \ngovernment officials to learn from, for instance, other natural resource-depending countries \nsuch as Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and Kazakhstan. The TA may engage international and national \nresource persons and short-term experts to carry out well-defined tasks that contribute to skill \ndevelopment (e.g., case study papers, workshop participation, and presentations). \n \n14.  The TA assumes strong commitment from major development partners in Mongolia to \nsupport  improved  aid  management  by  the  government,  strong  commitment  from  the \ngovernment  to  improve  its  aid  management,  and  sufficient  government  support,  including \nrelevant data, being provided to the consultant team. TA impact may be at risk in case of \nrenewed  government  institutional  restructuring  and  high  turnover  of  government  officials; \ninsufficient cooperation between the MOF and other ministries; or deficiencies in government \nreadiness, capacity, and priorities following recent government restructuring. These risks will be \nmanaged by establishing a steering committee consisting of relevant government agencies, \npreparing proper documentation of intermediate outputs, and facilitating ongoing dialogue with \nthe MOF and key stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, office supplies, and other in-\nkind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 27 months, from 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2017. \nThe executing agency will be the MOF, and the implementing agency will be the MOF.16 The TA \nwill establish a steering committee co-chaired by the MOF and the Cabinet Secretariat that may \ninclude officials from the Economic Development Committee, key line ministries, and other \nrelevant agencies.17 It will convene at least biannual meetings. The MOF will be responsible to \ninvolve all relevant stakeholders in the required TA consultations and implementation. \n \n17.  ADB will recruit a consulting firm using quality- and cost-based selection with a standard \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 by inviting simplified technical proposals to provide 16 person-months \nof international consultants and 26 person-months of national consultants. The consultants will \nhave theoretical and practical expertise in development assistance policy, cooperation, and \ncoordination, and will deliver the outputs described in para. 9. In addition, ADB will recruit an \nindividual national consultant as project coordinator for 22 person-months to coordinate TA \nimplementation, compose the project implementation unit, and closely liaise with ADB, the MOF, \nother stakeholders, and the firm. An outline terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix \n3. \n                                                \n15  Development partners not operating in the country but with a potentially important future role could be invited. \n16 The implementation agency will include the successor to the former MOED department that was responsible for \nloan and aid policy (yet to be determined). \n17 In particular, the Ministry of Energy and Mining may be interested to participate, as a group of development \npartners is already organizing periodic meetings. \n ", "  5\n \n18.   The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line \nwith ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The MOF will provide all counterpart facilities and support required by the consultants. \n \n19.  To facilitate implementation, ADB may establish an advance payment facility with the \nMOF to support certain agreed cash expenditures, including workshops, training, seminars, \nstudy tours, and conferences, and field work and survey activities, with details of the proposed \nactivities, including cost estimates, submitted through the executing agency to ADB for approval. \nADB may also make certain direct payments (e.g., for workshop venues). \n \n20.  The TA results, including knowledge products, will be disseminated through the release \nof project reports, workshops, seminars, and targeted outreach to government agencies and \ndevelopment partners. Workshops and seminars are expected to be attended by government \nofficials, development partners, specialists, and ADB representatives, to allow for the inclusion \nof  diverse  views  and  wide  dissemination  of  project  outputs.  MOF,  as  the  executing  and \nimplementing agency, with ADB support, will monitor project-specific indicators and targets in \nthe design and monitoring framework, including the outcome evaluation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Promoting Effectiveness of Development Cooperation, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved alignment  Two-thirds of relevant  Survey of development  Strong commitment by \nof development  development partners and  partners by MNRM in  major development \npartners\u2019 assistance  government officials  2018  partners in Mongolia to \nwith government  surveyed in 2018 report an  support improved aid \ndevelopment  improvement in the  management by the \npriorities and  government\u2019s aid  government. \nobjectives  management, resulting in   \nbetter alignment of  Risk \ndevelopment assistance  Renewed government \nwith the government\u2019s  institutional \nobjectives relative to 2014  restructuring and \n(baseline 2014: 0%)  turnover of government \n    officials. \n   \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved  Government coordinates  MNRM (received  Strong commitment by \nperformance of  development partner  invitations)  the government to \ngovernment to  meetings at least annually  improve its aid \neffectively plan and  by 2017 (baseline 2014: 0  management. \nmanage development  meetings)   \nassistance-supported    Risk \nprojects  Insufficient cooperation \n   \nbetween the MOF and \n    other ministries. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
