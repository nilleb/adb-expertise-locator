INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support Henan \nprovince in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to reform its budget expenditure management \nsystem. The TA will have two components that will study the development program expenditure \nstreams for (i) the traditional development program for expenditure standards, and (ii) the \nemerging development program, using agricultural insurance as a case study. This will help the \nprovincial government formulate development program expenditure standards to more efficiently \nand effectively allocate budget resources with the aim of strengthening budget expenditure \nmanagement.  \n \n2.  The Government of the PRC requested a TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nSupport to Public and Finance Sector Reform in Henan Province.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for the PRC, 2017\u20132019.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Henan province is in the central region of the PRC and is the country\u2019s most populous \nprovince, with over 94 million inhabitants, or about 7% of the national population. The per capita \nincome in Henan is below the national average and the economy is dominated by agriculture, \nmining, and traditional manufacturing, with a relatively small services sector. In 2016, Henan\u2019s \ngeneral revenue was $46.7 billion and its general expenditure was $110.5 billion. Approximately \n70% of expenditure is on various development programs, including social development programs \nand infrastructure investment projects, the costs of which vary tremendously by both year and \nprogram. About 30% of expenditure is for government operational costs, which are relatively \nconstant. \n \n4.  The  large  fiscal  gap  between  revenue  and  expenditure  and  the  complexity  in  cost \nestimation, standardization, and budgeting means the province faces tremendous fiscal pressure \neach year, with expectation and reliance on the downward intergovernment transfer payment from \nthe central government. There is a significant need for the Henan Provincial Finance Department \n(HPFD) to reduce its reliance on the central government and reform its budget management \nsystem to develop program expenditure standards that could help estimate and justify budget \nallocations. Without practical expenditure standards, budget preparation and approval rely heavily \non  the  bargaining  power  between  spending  units  and  budget  authority,  instead  of  solid \ncomputation of cost items. This compromises budget accuracy and preciseness. A budget that is \nless  accurate  requires  frequent  adjustments  during  execution,  which  often  delays  the \nimplementation of development programs and undermines their expected outcomes, reducing the \neffectiveness and efficiency of budgetary expenditure management.  \n \n5.  Henan  was  selected  by  MOF  as  a  pilot  province  to  develop  program  expenditure \nstandards in 2016. In line with MOF\u2019s pilot guidance, HPFD divides the development programs \ninto traditional development programs and emerging or innovative development programs. The \ntraditional  development  programs,  e.g.,  office  building  construction  and  maintenance, \ndemographic census, and information and communication technology programs, have adequate \nreference databases, computable cost items, clear engineering frameworks, practical procedures, \nand well-defined outputs and outcomes. These advantages help put the traditional development \n                                                \n1  The TA was listed under the nonlending products and services as \u201cHenan Cluster TA\u201d with two subprojects: \nSubproject 1: Study on Henan Fiscal Expenditure Budget Standard System; and Subproject 2: Henan Agriculture \nInsurance Study. \n2  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2017\u20132019. Manila. The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 August 2017. \n ", "2 \nprograms in a good position to set up program expenditure standards, and this then allows the \nprograms to be costed and budgeted in line with these preset expenditure standards.  \n \n6.  HPFD plans to develop consistent and comparable expenditure standards for all the \ntraditional  development  programs.  In  line  with  this  pilot  program,  three  types  of  program \nexpenditure standards will be developed: (i) common-use expenditure standards, which apply to \nbudgeting of similar programs across provincial government agencies; (ii) department-specific \nexpenditure standards, which apply to budgeting of similar programs in various subunits within a \nprovincial department; and (iii) program-specific expenditure standards, which only apply to \nprograms that have special technical requirements and cost factors. At the same time, a new \nclassification of program expenditures will be introduced.  HPFD will work together with all \nprovincial departments to develop the common-use program expenditure standards, and assist \neach provincial department to develop department-specific expenditure standards and program-\nspecific expenditure standards.3  \n \n7.  The emerging development programs involve complicated policy or institutional reforms, \nand  have  inadequate  reference  databases,  unclear  frameworks,  and  unfixed  cost  items. \nAgricultural  insurance  is  an  emerging  development  program,  seen  as  an  important  risk \nmanagement tool for farmers. Henan is an important agriculture province, being a core grain \nproducer for the PRC, which faces major risks of price volatility,4 production failure, and along the \nwhole  agribusiness  value  chain (post-harvest  storage  and  logistics),  which  has  resulted  in \neconomic losses, contributes to the government\u2019s fiscal burden, and directly impacts national food \nsecurity.5 With a high proportion of rural households dependent on publicly provided assistance, \nrisk management  strategies  and measures  are  important to  reduce  this  burden, for  which \ninsurance (an emerging industry in the PRC) has increasing importance. \n \n8.  The PRC embarked on a major program under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan to promote \nagricultural insurance through a massive injection of premium subsidies to promote decentralized \nagricultural insurance.6 The number of policies increased significantly and, in 2016, agricultural \ninsurance premiums reached $6.2 billion, making it the second largest agricultural insurance \nmarket in the world after the United States.7 Existing agricultural insurance products focus on \nproduction, with multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI) and high-value livestock insurance, such as for \nbreeding sows and dairy cows. The focus in Henan province has been on cropping for grain \nproduction and high value livestock. Although a growing market, the available insurance is narrow \nand does not provide adequate multilevel risk management due to the supply and demand \nmismatch  which  does  not  meet  the  demands  of  modern  agriculture.  A  lack  of  consumer \nawareness about insurance and its benefits also inhibits uptake of available insurance products. \nThe cost effectiveness for insurance companies, to develop and offer MPCI products is extremely \nchallenging, is associated with high administrative costs when dealing with many small holder \nfarmers and a lesser number of enterprises and cooperatives, lack of data quality and information \ntransparency and poor actuarial performance. In addition, access to insurance is not linked to \n                                                \n3 The pilot group are five provincial departments on education and training, health care and medical treatment, \nenvironmental protection and improvement, science and technology, and industrial development of manufacturing \nand information. \n4  Agriculture commodities such as rice and wheat still have a state-guaranteed purchase system. All other crops have \nopen market prices, which means farmers face risk from price changes. \n5  Agriculture production risks include exposure to climate risks of typhoon, flood, drought, hail, frost (freeze), and snow, \nall of which are exacerbated by the effects of climate change, causing annual average losses to crop production in \nthe PRC of about 9%. \n6  Premium subsidies being provided are up to 60%\u201365% for crops, 60% for livestock epidemic disease coverage, 60% \nfor dairy cows, and as high as 80% for reproductive sows of the total insurance premium. \n7  Government of the PRC. 2017. Agriculture Insurance Services for Modern Agriculture Development TA Proposal. \nZhengzhou.  \n ", "3 \ncredit or credit institutions. The high cost associated with MPCI products increases the need to \nsubsidize these products. This heavily subsidized agricultural insurance comes at significant cost \nto the government.8 The government is working to improve risk mitigation through improved and \ntargeted insurance products, more efficient delivery channels, and to refocus the use of traditional \nsubsidies.  \n \n9.  In addition to insurance, additional risk management solutions to avoid, mitigate, or \ntransfer risks, which combine technical and financial tools and approaches should be applied. The \nenabling  environment  and  specific  government  policies  to  promote  risk  mitigation  through \nagricultural insurance, coupled with access to finance and sound risk management, can contribute \nto (i) stabilizing agricultural production and farm incomes in times of major production loss and (ii) \nmodernizing agriculture through its ability to leverage access to credit, thereby enabling farmers \nto purchase production-enhancing technology.   \n \n10.  Developing expenditure standards to improve budget preparation as well as improving \nutilization of available fiscal resources, such as subsidies, will help HPFD to enhance fiscal \nmanagement. This will ensure there is adequate financing for its development programs and \ncontribute to achieving their development objectives.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: public sector management improved.9 The TA \nwill have the following outcome: program budget accuracy and preciseness improved.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Budgetary expenditure standards for selected development programs \nformulated. This output will assist HPFD in developing a budgetary expenditure standard system \nfor  traditional  development  programs  with  the  aim  of  strengthening  budgetary  program \nexpenditure  management.  Specifically,  the  subproject  aims  to  (i)  summarize  domestic  and \ninternational best practices in setting up program expenditure standards, (ii) analyze the major \ntechnical challenges and institutional obstacles that need to be addressed, (iii) construct a general \nframework for setting up a program expenditure standard system, (iv) develop procedures and \nmethods for program costing, (v) formulate expenditure standards for selected programs, (vi) \nprovide policy recommendations for improving program expenditure standards and draw up an \naction  plan  to  complete  the  program  expenditure  standard  system,  and  (vii)  disseminate \nknowledge products. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Agricultural  insurance  services  for  modern  agriculture  development \nprepared. As Henan is an agricultural province, significant fiscal outlay has been allocated for \nagriculture, forestry, and water resources. This output will assist HPFD to review its budget \nexpenditure under the emerging development program category for agricultural insurance so it \ncan apply a new approach to reviewing and assessing budget allocation and demand. Specifically, \nthe subproject aims to (i) assess agricultural supply chain (inputs, services, production, post-\nharvest, processing, logistics) risks and risk management strategies; (ii) review the current \nsubsidy mechanism, financing streams, and effectiveness, and propose improved approaches to \n                                                \n8  In 2009, total agricultural insurance premiums in the PRC increased significantly to $1.96 billion, with premium \nsubsidies estimated at about $1.18 billion (60% of total premiums). \n9  Government of the PRC. 2015.
