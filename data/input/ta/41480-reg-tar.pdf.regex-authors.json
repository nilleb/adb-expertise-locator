Improving the delivery of public services in the Asia and Pacific region is part of the \nenhanced poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Effective delivery \nand equitable access to public services are essential for broadening inclusiveness of growth \nand reducing poverty and inequality. The regional technical assistance (RETA) study, Equity in \nthe Delivery of Public Services in Selected Developing Member Countries (DMCs), fits into a \ncore  strategic  priority  of  ADB\u2019s  medium-term  strategy  II  (2006\u20132008)  to  strengthen \ninclusiveness. The RETA aims to increase understanding of the performance of public services, \nas well as the policy challenges and constraints to improving the delivery of these services in \nselected DMCs. Based on this improved understanding, the study will develop a framework for \nidentifying appropriate interventions to improve the delivery of public services that will suit \nindividual country circumstances. Four DMCs will be selected for inclusion in the RETA. While \npublic services encompass a broad range of elements to ensure people\u2019s well-being, the RETA \nwill  focus  on  services  with  direct  linkages  to  improving  education  and  health  outcomes: \neducation and health services, and infrastructure services such as those concerning water and \nsanitation. On 6 July 2007, ADB\u2019s vice president (knowledge management and sustainable \ndevelopment) approved a concept paper prepared for the RETA project. The draft design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n     \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The delivery of basic public services is central to reducing poverty. Poor people list water, \neducation, health care, and personal security needs as their highest priorities.2 Expanding \ninclusive service delivery is pivotal to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Although \nthe provision of basic education and health services is largely the responsibility of governments, \nthe private sector also has an important role. But since the provision of such services is replete \nwith market failures or externalities; the private sector would not likely be able to achieve the \nlevel of education and health that society expects. More importantly, education and health \nservices are deemed fundamental human rights. This suggests that regardless of the role \nplayed by the private sector, the public sector should be largely responsible for education and \nhealth of the people (the so-called merit goods argument). Thus studying how the government \ncan assume this fundamental responsibility in a satisfactory manner is of critical importance. A \nkey dimension of public service delivery is equity.   \n  \n3.  Equity has long been an important goal of education and health sectors. Yet, inequalities \nbetween the poor and the better-off persist. In the 1980s, governments typically were more \ninterested in addressing cost constraints and improving efficiency than in promoting equity. By \nthe end of the 1990s, many governments and international organizations were prioritizing equity \nin  their  development  agendas.  This  emphasis  continued  into  the  new  millennium,  and \ngovernments are increasingly focusing on policies and programs to reduce inequities. Equity of \npublic service delivery can be assessed by evaluating (i) accessibility; (ii) utilization; (iii) quality; \nand (iv) the progressive nature and redistributive effect of public spending (para. 7), including \nleakage of funds. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 November 2007. \n2  Narayan, D., R. Chambers, M. K. Shah, and P. Petesch. 2000. Voices of the Poor: Crying Out for Change. New \nYork: World Bank/Oxford University Press. \n ", " 2 \n4.  Accessibility. In many low income DMCs, access to schools, health clinics, clean water, \nsanitation facilities, and other services is limited. While available services may vary vastly from \none country to another, the rich tend to have better access than the poor. In some countries, the \npoor need to travel farther to reach education and health services than do the rich. In Nepal, the \npoorest 20% of the population needs to travel more than two times farther the richest 20% to \nreach the nearest schools, more than two times farther to reach the nearest health centers, and \nmore than three-and-a-half times farther to reach the nearest market centers.  \n \n5.  Utilization. The exact relationship between utilization of public services and prices or \nfamily income varies across individuals. For poor people, less utilization is often associated with \nlow income and high prices. The poor spend a large proportion of their money on public \nservices. In low-income countries, 80% of health spending is private; in middle-income countries, \nthe share is 50%.3 Moreover, the poor often need to pay more for the same goods and services. \nFor example, they often pay higher prices to water sellers than the better-off pay to utilities. In \nPune, India, low-income households pay many times more than the price of metered water used \nby middle- and upper-income households.  \n \n6.  Quality. In developing countries, public services are often of low quality even if they are \naccessible and affordable. As a result, many poor people bypass the closest public facilities to \ngo to more expensive private facilities or choose better quality at more distant facilities. The lack \nof accountability, weak supervision, high politicization, and fiscal constraints are considered \nserious impediments to the delivery of quality education and health services in Asia. Empirical \nevidence of teacher or health worker absenteeism in some parts of Asia indicates poor quality \npublic services.4 The technical quality of services is also an important element to ensure \neffective delivery of public services: services can fail the poor when inputs are combined to \nproduce ineffective or inefficient outcomes. Quality of public services is also determined by their \nresponsiveness to clients. Services should be provided to those who are in need, irrespective of \ntheir economic and social status. Recently the gap between the poor and rich in access to and \nutilization of quality education and health services has been growing rapidly, particularly with the \nincreasing role of the private sector that caters only to those who have the ability to pay.      \n \n7.  Progressivity  and  Redistributive  Effect  of  Public  Finance. Education and health \nspending accounts for about 33% of total public expenditure; 25% for low-income countries and \n29% for middle-income countries (footnote 3). Governments contribute a large share of the \nfinancing for schools and clinics. In this regard, the public sector is a major provider as well as a \nfunding source of education and health services. A question then arises as to the extent to \nwhich  payments  for  education  and  health  care  are  related  to  the  ability  to  pay.  Is  this \nrelationship proportional? Or is it progressive, i.e., do payments for education and health care \naccount  for  an  increasing  proportion  of  ability  to  pay  as  the  ability  to  pay  rises?  Is  this \nrelationship regressive, in the sense that payments comprise a decreasing share of the ability to \npay? Progressivity is measured in regard to departure from proportionality in the relationship \nbetween payments toward provision of public services and ability to pay. The relationship \nbetween  progressivity  and  the  redistributive  impact  of  service  payments  also  needs  to  be \ninvestigated. Redistribution can be vertical and horizontal. Vertical redistribution occurs when \npayments are disproportionately related to the ability to pay. Horizontal redistribution occurs \nwhen people with equal ability to pay contribute unequally to the payments for services.  \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2007. World Development Indicators. Washington, DC. \n4  A number of studies have examined the problem of absence among education and health providers in India and \nIndonesia.

The  belief  that  increasing  budgetary  resources  will \nautomatically improve the delivery of basic services in education and health is widely accepted. \nHowever, a growing body of studies demonstrates that allocating more budgetary resources to \nthese sectors will not necessarily deliver better outcomes. Public spending may have little \nimpact on the education and health status of individuals if public expenditures do not translate \ninto improved services due to leakage of funds. Public resources may not adequately measure \nthe availability of effective services in a context where mismanagement, rent-seeking activities, \ncorruption,  and  poor  targeting  thrive.  Significant  differences  could  occur  between  official \nspending in a sector, and actual spending by the provider because of capture and leakages of \nfunds at various layers of the political and administrative systems. This in turn calls for well-\ntargeted policy intervention to ensure public services do reach the people, particularly the poor \nand vulnerable.  \n \n9.  ADB has completed a number of technical assistance and RETA projects in relation to \npublic service delivery (Supplementary Appendix A, available on request), but these are largely \nconfined to issues of decentralization and governance. Beyond these issues, this RETA will \nprovide qualitative and quantitative analysis of public service delivery, with a particular focus on \neducation and health equity in selected DMCs. Findings that emerge from the RETA could be \nuseful for ADB operations as well as government policy making.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The RETA is expected to improve the capacity of DMCs to make informed decisions on \npolicy and reforms required for better delivery of public services. The outcome is improved \nknowledge on (i) the performance of public service delivery in DMCs, (ii) the constraints to \nimproving the delivery of public services, and (iii) policy challenges.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  RETA  will  draw  on  various  approaches and  methodologies  used  in  education, \nhealth economics, and public finance. Along with the suggested methodologies, the RETA will \nexplore relevant key variables and questions (Appendix 2). The draft outline of the contents for \nthe report is provided in Supplementary Appendix B (available on request). \n   \n12.  Key Variables. The RETA will focus on variables, including (i) education and health \noutcomes within and across countries; (ii) access to and utilization of quality education and \nhealth care; (iii) subsidies received through the use of services; (iv) payments people make for \neducation  and  health  care\u2014directly  through  out-of-pocket  payments  as  well  as  indirectly \nthrough  insurance  premiums,  social  insurance  contributions,  and  taxes;  and  (v)  policy \ninterventions for effective service delivery. For variables (i) to (iii), the RETA will explore the \nmagnitude of inequality between the poor and the better-off. In the case of variable (iv), it will \nseek to establish to whom the benefits of government spending accrue, with recipients being \nranked by their relative economic position. It will examine the distribution of average spending \nand consider the benefit incidence of marginal dollars spent on education and health care. This \nissue is also related to the importance of government resource leakages in education and health \nfunds, which can deter effective service delivery. In this context, the RETA will pay particular \nattention to progressivity; the incidence of catastrophic payments in the health sector; incidence \nof impoverishing payments (i.e., those that cause a household to cross the poverty threshold); \n ", " 4 \nas  well  as  defining  and  quantifying  leakages.  Variable  (v)  is  concerned  with  evaluating  a \nparticular policy intervention that is ongoing or will soon be implemented. More specifically, the \nRETA will investigate the impact of conditional cash transfers on poverty reduction, health and \nnutritional  status  of  children  from  poor  families,  and  school  attendance.  Targeting  related \nissues\u2014such as targeting methods, exclusion and inclusion errors, administrative costs, and \nidentification  of  beneficiaries  using  nonincome  indicators\u2014are  of  great  relevance  to  ADB \noperations and will be investigated in the RETA. Such issues are extremely important for \ndesigning and implementing social policies. \n \n13.  Tools. The questions that the RETA seeks to answer require quantitative analysis that \ndemands a few key ingredients. First, suitable data sets are needed. Since the analysis involves \ncomparing individuals or households in different socioeconomic circumstances, the data for \neducation and health equity analysis will be mainly household surveys that are already available. \nIn  addition,  data  on  public  spending  on  education  and  health\u2014for  both  central  and  local \ngovernments\u2014will  be  required.  Consultations  will  be  conducted  with  central  and  local \ngovernments.  Second,  the  definition  and  measurement  of  key  variables  will  be  clarified, \nincluding  education  and  health  outcomes,  service  utilization,  service  needs,  subsidies, \npayments, and living standards. Third, the RETA will need a set of quantitative methods to \nmeasure  inequality  in  education  and  health,  progressivity  of  payments  for  public  services, \nincidence and intensity of catastrophic payments, and incidence of impoverishing payments. \nImpact evaluation methods will be utilized for program evaluation.  \n \n14.  Key activities of the RETA are (i) country-specific inception workshops, (ii) a regional \nconference to disseminate findings of country studies, (iii) publication of country studies and \ncomparative analyses in journals or books, and (iv) external press releases. The inception \nworkshop will include participants from the concerned ministries and the selected consultants \nfor the country study. It will discuss refinements to the suggested methodologies by each team \ntasked to handle the country case studies. \n \n15.    Under the RETA, ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department (ERD) will prepare two \nbackground  papers.  One  paper  will  investigate  inequalities  in  health  and  education  from \noutcome indicators across the Asia and Pacific region over time. It will develop a new index that \ncaptures the disparity in economic and noneconomic welfare of individual countries, as well as \naggregate welfare of all the countries in the region. This will intend to show inequality between \ncountries. The second paper will consider methodological issues relating to the measurement of \nequity in health and education. It will also deal with the trade-off between equity and efficiency.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The RETA is estimated to cost $500,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance funding program. The proceeds will cover consulting services, country \nvisits, workshops, data purchase, in-depth studies, equipment, and administration and support \ncosts. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will implement the RETA in two stages in partnership with relevant in-country \nresearch institutions or individuals, and in coordination with relevant government agencies in the \nparticipating DMCs. The Philippines and Nepal will be the participating DMCs in the first stage, \nthe former representing a middle-income country and the latter a low-income country. Another \nconsideration in country selection is data availability. Two more participating countries will be \n ", "                      5\nselected for the second stage, in consultation with regional departments. ERD will administer \nthe RETA in close coordination with the country teams in the regional departments of the \nparticipating countries. A no-objection will be obtained from the relevant DMCs prior to starting \nany activities under the RETA. The RETA will be implemented from June 2008 to December \n2009. \n \n18.  The RETA will require an estimated total of 50 person-months of consulting services \n(15 person-months international and 35 person-months national). ERD will set up a technical \nadvisory panel of experts who will provide methodological or technical guidance and strategic \ndirections  to  the  project.  ADB  will  engage  all  consultants  as  individuals  or  as  firms  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). An outline of the terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  For each participating country, a team will be formed to carry out the study. Each team \nwill submit three reports: (i) an inception report no later than 4 weeks following commencement \nof services; (ii) a draft report at the end of the 6th month; and (iii) a final report within 4 weeks of \nreceiving comments on the draft report from the ADB and peer groups. Based on the country \nreports, the project team will produce a final report highlighting the key findings of the RETA \nstudy to facilitate policy reviews by governments and stakeholders.  \n \n20.  The findings of the RETA studies will be disseminated through seminars, inception and \nfinalization workshops, publications in professional journals and books, and press releases.     \n \n21.  ADB will procure equipment (computer hardware and software) in accordance with its \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Procurement will be coordinated \nwith ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and Office of Administrative Services. \nAfter the RETA, any procured equipment will be disposed of in accordance with the project \nadministration instructions on administering grant-financed technical assistance.5 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nEquity in the Delivery of Public Services in Selected Developing Member Countries, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.
