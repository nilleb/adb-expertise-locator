INTRODUCTION\n1. With increasing calls from international assistance agencies for results-focused analysis\nof institutional performance, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Second Water Utilities Data\nBook1  highlights  the  need  for  water  supply  utilities  to  adopt  appropriate  standards  of\nperformance for service delivery. Governments are encouraging utilities to adopt appropriate\nstandards  for  managing  natural,  human,  and  financial  resources.  While  appropriate\nperformance evaluation criteria may differ from one utility to another, the Second Water Utilities\nData Book suggests an approach to criteria selection. The Second Water Utilities Data Book,\ntogether with the Electric Utilities Data Book,2 presents comparative data from which trends in\nservice provision can be identified.\n2. A regional seminar, held for Pacific water utilities in the Fiji Islands in 1997, identified a\nneed for Pacific power and water utilities to cooperate in adopting performance evaluation\ncriteria, benchmarking, and preparing action plans to improve institutional policies. This regional\ntechnical assistance (TA) is based on ADB\u2019s strategy of developing regional cooperation by\nsupporting comparative analysis and exchange of experience, and encouraging participatory\nand consultative development  activities.  The  TA  was  endorsed  by  the  Regional  Technical\nAssistance Screening Committee on 1 October 1999. Discussions were held with the Pacific\nPower Association (PPA) and the Pacific Water Association (PWA); both have indicated their\nsupport and assistance for the TA. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1.3\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. While differing in many ways, ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs)\nshare  characteristics  of  smallness,  remoteness,  and  difficulty  in  developing  and  retaining\ncapacity for basic service provision. Many of the electric power and water supply utilities have a\nhigh degree of dependence on external financial and technical support, and on external energy\nsources;  low  levels  of  cost  recovery  and  demand  management;  limited  resources  for\nmaintaining equipment; and customers who expect a high level of service.\n4. Anxious to encourage development, electric power and water supply utilities in many\nPDMCs are facing the combined challenge of diminishing direct external support, and assets\nand facilities that are in need of replacement or renewal. In the fields of water supply and\nelectric power development ADB is helping the PDMCs improve the service delivery efficiency\nthrough institutional and policy adjustments, as well as the improvement of physical assets.\n5. However, few utilities in the Pacific region have attempted to define their service goals,\nand fewer have attempted to quantify their development needs on the basis of achievements\nwithin strategic result areas. The longer-term impacts of their programs have seldom been fully\nidentified.  Few  have  adopted  firm  benchmarks,  based  on  rational  performance  evaluation\ncriteria, to measure their performance and development progress.  Performance targets need to\nbe defined, based on a clearer analysis of expected results; and firm data to measure efficiency\nand improvement of service delivery needs to be regularly generated and reported. Rationally\nbased  strategies  and  action  plans,  that  set  out  clear  targets  for  institutional  and  policy\ndevelopment, as well as improvements to facilities, are required.\n                                               \n1  Asian Development Bank, Manila, 1997Second Water Utilities Data Book, edited by Arthur C. McIntosh and\nCesar E. Yniguez.\n2  Asian Development Bank, Manila, 1997 Electric Utilities Data Book.\n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 1999.", "2\n6. The need for regional cooperation and exchange of experience was recognized in the\nestablishment of PPA and PWA. The principal electric power and water supply utilities from\neach Pacific country are members of one or both of these organizations. PPA and PWA are\nalready fulfilling their roles in disseminating information and  sharing experience,  but direct\ncontact with member utilities is limited by long travel distances and high travel costs.\n7. Electric power and water supply utilities in the Pacific region recognize the need to adopt\nrational performance evaluation criteria and performance benchmarking. Electric power utilities\nhave, through PPA, already commenced regional cooperation on this issue. Pacific power and\nwater utilities recognize that, in view of their smallness and remoteness, performance evaluation\ncriteria and benchmarking systems need to be tailored to their specific needs. They have,\nthrough PPA and PWA, indicated a high level of commitment to the TA.\n8. ADB is currently financing several projects to improve the efficiency of the delivery of\nelectric power, water supply, and sanitation services in PDMCs. There are ongoing projects in\nthe water supply and power sectors in Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of\nMicronesia, and Vanuatu. Feasibility studies are being carried out in Cook Islands, Fiji Islands,\nand Papua New Guinea. Future project financing is programmed for Samoa. The establishment\nof rational performance benchmarks for use in these relatively small countries will enable the\nrefinement of frameworks to measure medium- and long-term impacts, and will help determine\nthe need for further assistance to the  sectors.  The  TA  will  enhance  the dissemination of\ninformation between PDMCs, and will help focus assistance to the special needs of these small,\nrelatively isolated, communities.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n9. The objectives of the TA are to assist in (i) improving the delivery of electric power, water\nsupply,  and  sanitation  services  through  the  establishment  and  adoption  of  appropriate\noperational, institutional, and financial performance evaluation criteria and benchmarks within\nutility  organizations;  and  (ii)  developing  appropriate  regulatory,  managerial,  and  technical\npractices through consultations between power and water utilities within the Pacific region.\nB. Scope\n10. The TA will use a participatory approach involving electric power and water supply\nutilities  within  the  Pacific  region.  PWA  and  PPA  will  be  the  focal  points  for  discussion,\ndissemination,  and  exchange  of  information.  Emphasis  will  be  placed  on  a  participatory\nworkshop in which performance evaluation criteria will be discussed, and utilities will decide on\nappropriate performance benchmarks. Participants will also draft preliminary action plans to\nimprove the efficiency of service provision; these plan will be refined later. The TA will be\nimplemented in three phases.\n11. Phase 1 \u2013 Initial Surveys Indicative outputs of utility deliverables, as presented in the\nADB\u2019s Second Water Utilities Data Book and Electric Utilities Data Book, will be developed,\nupdated, and expanded to cover all ADB member countries in the Pacific region. Utilities which\nmay be water and power utilities, authorities, or government departments, depending on the\ncountry concerned will carry out internal surveys of their operations. They will also carry out\ncustomer surveys of their operations. Under the auspices of PPA and PWA, the survey may be", "3\nexpanded to cover all of their members.  The surveys will cover all facets of utility operations,\nincluding  population  served,  consumption,  production  and  generation,  demand,  supply\nconstraints,  system  losses,  tariffs,  demand  management  measures,  financial  data,  and\navailability of human resources with appropriate skills to staff the utilities. The PDMCs will\nprovide information on the performance of the water, sanitation, and electric power sectors, and\non present policies, and institutional and fiscal arrangements.\n12. Phase  2  \u2013  Consultations  with  Pacific  Power  and  Water  Supply  Utilities    A\nparticipatory workshop, will be held at a regional center in the Pacific. Participants will include\nrepresentatives from governments, power and water supply utilities, and regulatory agencies in\nthe  Pacific  region.  Participants  will  identify  key  strategic  and  results  areas  for  framing\nperformance evaluation criteria, and will determine appropriate performance benchmarks for\ntheir utilities. Specific reference will be made to issues of common interest to utilities in the\nPacific region.  Participants will also discuss the technical standards used by their respective\nutilities, and methods of adopting and promulgating appropriate technical standards.\n13. Working papers, including discussion documents, will be prepared and circulated to\nparticipants in advance. During the workshop, participants will introduce the results of the\nsurveys carried out in Phase 1 for their respective utilities. Resource persons will prepare\npapers on specialized subjects of interest to Pacific power and water supply utilities. Selected\nparticipants will present case studies based on the experience of their utilities. All participants\nwill draw on the operating experience of their utilities in deciding on appropriate criteria and\nbenchmarks. Participants will formulate outline action plans for improving the performance of\ntheir own utilities. Methods of formulating, adopting, and promulgating of appropriate technical\nstandards will also be addressed by the workshop.\n14. Phase 3 \u2013 Adoption  of  Evaluation  Criteria,  Benchmarking,  and  Preparation  of\nAction Plans  The consultants will prepare a publication that sets out the findings of the\nworkshop, results of the surveys, recommended performance evaluation criteria, methods of\napplying  the performance  evaluation  criteria  to  provide  benchmarks  for  assessing  utilities\u2019\nperformance,  and  methods  of  promulgating  appropriate  technical  standards.  Workshop\nparticipants, on returning to their organizations, will develop their  outline  action  plans and\nincorporate the use of evaluation criteria in their internal and public reporting procedures. Action\nplans will be forwarded to ADB.\n15. PPA and PWA will hold copies of the action plans and public reports for dissemination,\nand periodic updating of information and data. In cooperation with PPA and PWA, and through\ndirect contact with utilities that are implementing ADB-financed projects, ADB will monitor the\nprogress of utilities in adopting benchmarking systems and in the implementing action plans.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The TA is estimated to cost at $250,000. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant\nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost\nestimates are presented in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n17. The TA will be implemented by ADB\u2019s South Pacific Regional Mission. During\nimplementation, ADB will continue to cooperate with electric power and water supply utilities in\nthe  Pacific  region,  through  PPA  and  PWA.  In  Phase  1,  PPA  and  PWA  will  coordinate", "4\nimplementation of the initial surveys, and the collection of the survey results. In Phase 2, PPA\nand PWA will help organize the participatory workshop. Other agencies, including the World\nBank and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, will also attend. At the\nconclusion of the TA, PPA and PWA will become central agencies for collecting, updating, and\ndisseminating information and data. They will hold data banks and libraries of action plans and\npublic reports on the operating performance of electric power and water supply utilities in the\nPacific region. ADB financing will include the costs of workshop attendance of participants from\nthe PDMCs.\n18. An international consultant, a specialist in water supply and electric power management\n(required for 3.5 person-months), will be based at SPRM, and will facilitate TA implementation.\nThe consultant will prepare questionnaires and information material, and coordinate closely with\nPPA and PWA to guide the initial surveys. The consultant will coordinate with PPA and PWA to\ncollect and analyze the survey results, prepare working papers for the participatory workshop,\nand organize and conduct the workshop. The consultant will coordinate with ADB, PPA and\nPWA  in  selecting  resource  persons  and  lead  speakers  for  the  workshop;  they  will  have\nexperience with operation and management of power and water supply systems of particular\nrelevance to the Pacific.\n19. Specific issues to be addressed in the resource and participants\u2019 papers will be identified\nduring Phase 2, and are likely to include utilities management, regulation, and private sector\nparticipation. The consultant will be selected as an individual consultant, in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultant are\ngiven in Appendix 3.\n20. The TA will be implemented over 15 months. Phase 1 activities will be completed over 3\nmonths. Phase 2 activities, which will include preparatory work for the participatory workshop,\nand the workshop itself, will take 6 months. Phase 3 activities, including the preparation, editing,\nand publication of final reports will be completed in 6  months.  The  TA  will  commence  in\nFebruary 2000, and be completed in April 2001.\n21. Reports and documents prepared during TA implementation include the collation and\nanalysis of data from the Phase 1 surveys, and working papers for the participatory workshop in\nPhase 2. The consultant and the resource persons will prepare the working papers.  The TA\nfindings will be summarized in a publication that will include the results of the Phase 1 surveys,\nrecommended  performance  evaluation  criteria,  systems  of  performance  benchmarking,\nmethods for reporting utilities\u2019 performance in key results areas, and methods of promulgating\nappropriate technical standards. A separate report will summarize the utilities\u2019 outline action\nplans.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n22. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$250,000 for the purpose of Performance Benchmarking for Pacific Power and Water Utilities\nand hereby reports such action to the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1, Page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Indicators Monitoring Risks /\nMechanism Assumptions\n1.
