An environmental impact assessment was undertaken and \nAssessment  a summary was circulated to the Board on 30 June 2005.* \n   \nSector  In  2005,  the  Government  approved  a  Medium-Term  Development \nInvestment  Framework 2005\u20132010 (MTDF) targeting key infrastructure subsectors.  \nProgram  Roads, railway systems, ports and airports are some of the priorities. \nDescription  This framework itself is embedded in individual subsector roadmaps \nand is therefore a means to articulate a longer term strategic endeavor \nin the selected areas. The Investment Program under the framework \nwill help modernize existing facilities but also add new assets. The \noutcome will be greater and better connectivity within and across the \ncountry\u2019s principal economic centers and into neighboring countries. \nThis will pave the way for greater and better logistics, which in turn will \nimprove  access  to  export  points,  people  mobility,  trade  and \ncompetitiveness.  Better logistics will also cut the final cost of goods \nand services.  \n \nRoad transport is the dominant mode for freight in Pakistan and the \ndevelopment/upgrading of national highway network features as a top \npriority within the MTDF and the longer term framework. The MTDF \nsets out key projects to begin during 2005/2010; in some instances \nprojects  will  be  completed  during  the  subsequent  5  years  ending \n2014/15.  The  projected  capital  outlays  from  the  National  Highway \nAuthority (NHA) over the next 10 years runs into PRs138.5 billion ($2.3 \nbillion). The MTDF program itself costs much more than that (PRs268.2 \nbillion or $4.5 billion). This implies the need for mobilizing additional \ndomestic and international resources.  The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is one of the financing sources being tapped by the authorities.  \nOthers  include  the  private  sector  through  the  structuring  of  various \ninvestments  under  the  modality  of  Private  Public  Initiatives  (PPIs), \ncommercial banks and other multilateral and bilateral agencies.  \n \nThe  MTDF  has  been  converted  by  NHA  into  a  National  Highway \nDevelopment  Plan  (NHDP).  This  focuses  on  immediate  priority \ninvestment  and  noninvestment  interventions  needed  to  overcome \ncritical bottlenecks in the national highway network. To help meet these \nfinancing requirements, ADB has been requested to provide assistance \nthrough a multitranche financing facility (MFF). \n \nThe multitranche modality is the most appropriate in this instance.  The \nGovernment has a well-defined investment program, a roadmap and a \ndiversity of project development structures (including PPIs) and the \nneed for co-financing.  The long term nature of the investment program \nand the variety of subprojects requires a flexible facility that combines \n \n*  \nThe summary EIA was circulated with title PAK: Proposed Subregional Transport Connectivity (Pakistan) Sector \nProject.  ", "ii   \nfinancing with reforms and adherence to ADB and Government guiding \nprinciples in the areas of safeguards, fiduciary oversight, procurement, \ndisbursement, administration, monitoring, evaluation and reporting.       \n \nThe Investment Program is structured into three batches of subprojects. \nThe  first  batch  comprises  three  sample  subprojects  totaling  376 \nkilometers (km); the second batch five subprojects totaling 460 km. The \nnumber  of  subprojects  under  the  third  batch  has  not  yet  been \ndetermined.  The nature of the subprojects is the same; the number will \ndiffer according to local conditions. All subprojects will comply with pre-\nagreed selection criteria. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  includes  noninvestment  interventions, \nespecially in the area of capacity building.  This support will focus on \nplanning  and  design;  management  oversight  for  construction \nschedules, procurement, safeguards, and fiduciary arrangements.  The \nwork will also cover policy reform.  The sector roadmap provides for \npublic policy changes during the investment program. The proposed \nassistance will target such policy changes as they fall due, in essence \nto enhance the viability and credibility of the Investment Program.  \n   \nMultitranche  An MFF amounting to $770 million. This financing represents 33% of \nFinancing  the total financing plan envisaged under the NHDP.  The ADB funding \nFacility  covers investment and noninvestment interventions. The MFF has a \nmaximum utilization period of 10 years. Individual periodic financing \nrequests (PFRs) will be converted into individual or separate loans. The \nGovernment  and  NHA  have  entered  into  a  Framework  Financing \nAgreement (FFA) with ADB. The FFA satisfies the requirements set \nforth in Appendix 4 of the Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. \nPursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted to ADB the first \nPFR in the amount of $180 million. The first PFR is presented to the \nBoard, together with the FFA. Prior to ADB acceptance of a PFR, ADB \nwill ensure that the Government and NHA comply in full with the terms \nand conditions of the Framework Financing Agreement.  ADB teams \nwill  conduct  due  diligence  on  these  to  ensure  that  they  are  being \nsatisfactorily adhered to. The minimum PFR or loan request at any one \ntime will not be less than $100 million. \n   \nRationale  Efficient transport systems and networks contribute to economic growth \nand  prosperity.  Investment  and  noninvestment  interventions  in  this \nnetwork ultimately help tackle poverty. This approach and prioritization \nis embodied in the Country Strategy Program (CSP), the platform for \nADB operations (public and private).  The package of assistance from \nADB targets institutional and capacity building. The latter is important in \nterms of defining and executing policy reform, but also better strategic \nthinking  for  the  sector  and  planning,  and  oversight  over  the \nmaintenance  and  upkeep  of  the  new  assets  created  out  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  support  envisaged  will  also  ensure  a \ncompetitive or \u201clevel playing field\u201d for the procurement and provision of \ngoods, civil works and related services. Institutional reforms will enable \nNHA perform its strategic planning and management role, while setting \nthe scene for the involvement of the private sector. The latter will be \ninvited  to  take  part  in  strategic  parts  of  the  network  \u2013  both  as  an \ninvestor and operator.  The investment in the highway network will \nrespond  to  increasing  traffic  and  address  poor  road  conditions  in ", "  iii\nvarious parts of the country.  \n   \nImpact and   The Investment Program will improve existing road network assets, \nOutcome  create new ones and advance policy reform.  The latter will create an \nenabling environment for private sector participation in the system. The \nmain  reforms  are  summarized  in  the  Road  Sector  Development \nFramework. This framework has been endorse by NHA and will trigger \nfuture lending by ADB to Pakistan\u2019s national highway subsector.  \n \nThe Investment Program will deliver on two basic objectives. The first is \nimprovement in transport efficiency by (i) adopting a national transport \npolicy, (ii) strengthening NHA performance in managing the national \nhighway network, (iii) improving road safety, and (iv) improving road \nmaintenance and funding. The second objective is to increase private \nsector  participation  in  road  subsector  investments  by  (i)  increasing \noutsourcing of road works, and (ii) establishing operations jointly with \nNHA. \n \n  To  realize  these  objectives,  the  Investment  Program  will  consist  of \nnational highway network investment and institutional strengthening of \nNHA. \n   \nCost Estimates  The NHDP amounts to $2.3 billion, of which the Investment Program \ncomprising  the  first  three  batches  to  be  implemented  amount \napproximately to $966.8 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing  ($ million)\nPlan  \nSource  Total  Percent \n     \nADB, Ordinary Capital Resources  770.0  33.4 \nADB, Special Funds Resources   3.0  0.1 \nGovernment   193.8  8.4 \nTotal Investment Program  966.8   \nGovernment and other agencies  1,341.5  58.1 \nTotal  2,308.3  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n   \nADB Financing   An MFF of up to $770 million or its equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \nand Terms  capital resources will be made available. The MFF is expected to be \ndrawn down in five separate PFRs during the 2006 to 2011 period. \nFinal terms and conditions for PFR will be determined in the context of \neach request. Terms and conditions will be finalized at the time of the \nrelevant  PFR  release  and  will  follow  prevailing  ADB  policies.  In \ngeneral, the financing made available under each PFR is anticipated to \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased facility. The Government has the option to choose between \neligible  currencies  and  interest  margin  regime  for  each  loan. \nRepayment schedules can also be structured for the purposes of each \nPFR. \n \n  In addition, a loan of $3.0 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special \n ", "iv   \nFunds resources. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions  as  set  forth  in  the  relevant  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. \n \nAllocation and  The Government will extend to NHA the proceeds under each loan in \nRelending Terms  local  currency  in  accordance  with  its  policies  in  this  regard.  The \n  Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on each loan. \n   \nClosing Date for  31 December 2011 \nSubmission of PFRs \n   \nEstimated  30 June 2015 \nInvestment Program \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  National Highway Authority \n   \nImplementation  NHA  will  establish  an  investment  program  coordinating  committee, \nArrangements  chaired  by  the  NHA  chairperson,  to  monitor  and  oversee  overall \ninvestment  program  implementation.  NHA  will  establish  two \nmanagement units, one for implementation of the national highways \nimprovement  component  and  the  other  for  the  implementation  of \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  NHA.  The  implementation  of  each \nsubproject  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  managed  by  a \ndedicated team.  \n   \nProcurement  All civil works contract packages will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following international competitive \nbidding procedures.  \n   \nConsulting  The international consultants engaged on a consulting firm basis will \nServices   be  evaluated,  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures  and  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Individual  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \ndomestic consultants on other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n   \nProgram Benefits  By  increasing  the  capacity  on  the  main  domestic  corridors  the \nand Beneficiaries  Investment Program will improve the overall performance of the road \nsubsector  network  and  contribute  to  transport  efficiency.  This  will \nimprove  the  returns  and  sustainability  of  existing  and  future  road \nassets  in  the  sector,  and  contribute  to  a  wide  range  of  economic \nactivities that depend on road transport services. Improved access to \neconomic opportunities and services will tackle poverty reduction. The \nInvestment Program will  also serve regional transport connectivity and \ntrade, \n \nThe  quantified  economic  benefits  consist  of  savings  in  vehicle \noperating costs and passenger time. The economic internal rate of \nreturn of the first batch three sample subprojects is between 16.5% \nand 37.8%. Beneficiaries will include (i) direct users of road transport, \nincluding owners/operators of trucks, passengers of the various vehicle \ncategories,  laborers,  and  the  Government;  (ii)  those  benefiting ", "  v\nindirectly because they live in the immediate area of influence of the \nproject improvements; and (iii) those in the immediate influence area \nemployed on project construction. \n \n   \nRisks and   The major risks for the Investment Program are (i) slow progress in the \nAssumptions  recruitment of consultants for construction supervision activities; (ii) \nslow  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  agreed  policy  reforms, \nleading to less than intended improvements in sector performance; \nand (iii) slow utilization of the MFF to implement the NHDP over 10 \nyears. NHA has prepared advance consultant recruitment documents, \nwhich will be issued to the short-listed consulting firms before Board \nconsideration of the Investment Program. Local procurement experts \nhave been recruited to cope with the initial workload. The policy reform \nrisks have been mitigated in the project design in accordance with the \nagreed Road Sector Development Framework with milestones to be \nmet for future ADB involvement in the sector. \n \n  The  MFF  modality  is  new  to  ADB  and  Pakistan.  Thus  special \ninvestment program teams will be on standby to offer advice and guide \nNHA  on  specific  issues  and  problems  pertaining  to  terms  and \nconditions for the use of the MFF. The Government and NHA are \nproviding ADB with a set of specific \u201cwarranties and representations\u201d \non various fronts and will need real time support prior to making formal \nsubmission of individual PFRs under the MFF. ADB will handle this \nrequirement in two ways. Firstly, it will strengthen the human resources \nof  its  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  to  deliver  additional  capacity  in \nprocurement  and  safeguard  compliance  activities.  Secondly, \nheadquarters staff responsible for the Investment Program will utilize \ntime  savings  arising  out  of  the  elimination  of  repetitive  processing \ntasks, directing these resources toward the supervision and monitoring \nof the Investment Program. This is clearly one of the advantages of the \nMFF.  NHA  has  the  capacity  and  willingness  to  adhere  to  the \nframework facility understandings, but from time to time the parties in \nthe  field  will  require  special  assistance.  ADB  will  position  itself  to \nprovide this. Finally, the Investment Program is accompanied by an \ninstitutional and capacity building component, the aim of which is to \nprovide practical and real time support to the executing agency for the \npurposes of selected implementation work.    \n \n  There  is  potentially  a  fiduciary  oversight  risk  associated  with  the \nInvestment  Program.  However,  this  will  be  addressed  through \noversight and monitoring arrangements in the areas of procurement, \naccounting,  administration  and  reporting.  Financial  management, \nbetter  and  transparent  budgeting,  management  and  information \nsystem  improvement,  and  strengthened  financial  planning  will  form \npart of this capacity-building endeavor. A longer term objective will be \nto leave in place, systems, people, and procedures that can outlive the \nInvestment Program itself. The Government and NHA are especially \nkeen on this approach and accordingly will work with ADB toward this \nendeavor. \n \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) and loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the National \nHighway Development Sector Investment Program. The design and monitoring framework for \nthe Investment Program is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Roads \n2.  Transport  contributes  about  10%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Road  transport  is  the \ndominant  mode,  accounting  for  91%  of  passenger  traffic  and  96%  of  freight  traffic.  Road \ntransport services are largely in the private sector, which handles about 95% of freight traffic \nand is highly competitive. During the 1990s, the overall demand for road transport grew at 7\u20138% \nper year, compared with average gross domestic product growth of 4\u20135%. The number of \nregistered motor vehicles in 2004 was 2.94 million (20 per 1,000 population), with a further 3.01 \nmillion motorcycles and rickshaws. The combined fleet is growing at 9% annually. The total \nlength of the road network is some 250,000 kilometers (km), 60% is paved. \n  \n3.  Traffic  using  the  national  highway  network,  comprising  about  8,320  km  of  national \nhighways  and  710  km  of  motorways,  is  largely  commercial:  75\u201380%  of  traffic.  The  main \ndomestic  artery  is  concentrated  along  the  1,760  km  Karachi\u2013Lahore\u2013Peshawar  (M9/N5) \ncorridor. This serves 80% of the urban population and carries over 55% of intercity traffic. The \ncorridor also links Punjab and the northern parts of the country with international markets \nthrough the southern Karachi area ports, which account for 96% of all trade. About 60% of the \nport traffic moves along this corridor. Other national highways include N55 (Indus Highway), \nN25, N65, N40, N70, and N35 (Karakoram Highway). A detailed condition survey in 2001 \nindicated that 50% of the national highway network was in poor to very poor condition. Some \ndeteriorated sections are located on important interprovincial and subregional routes (N25, N50, \nand N70), connecting Pakistan with Afghanistan, and providing access to southern ports. \n \n4.  The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications  is \nresponsible for the operation, maintenance, and development of the national highway system. \nNHA  is  an  autonomous  highway  agency  with  a  functional  structure  and  decentralized \nimplementation arrangements through regional provincial offices. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the World Bank have provided assistance1 (i) to reorganize and commercialize NHA, \nshifting its focus to that of a network operator and service provider, and (ii) to strengthen \nfinancial management systems to improve governance. NHA has internal capacity constraints, \nsuch as limited in-house capability in strategic planning, project and asset management, and \nnetwork operation.  \n \n5.  An analysis of the road sector and NHA operations is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Road Sector Development Program. Manila (Loan 1891-PAK approved on 19 \nDecember 2001 for $50 million) and World Bank-financed Highway Rehabilitation Project. \n ", "2   \n2.  National Highway Development Plan \n \n6.  In 2005, the Government approved the Medium-Term Development Framework 2005\u2013\n2010 (MTDF), which was prepared on the basis of the following considerations: (i) optimal \nutilization of the existing capacity with emphasis on rehabilitating and upgrading; (ii) selective \nand cost-efficient investments in economically viable new roads, including expansion of the rural \nnetwork; (iii) development/improvement of the road network to facilitate transport and trade with \nAfghanistan,  Central  Asian  republics  and  India;  (iv)  development  of  innovative  financing \nmechanisms and enhancement of private sector participation; (v) priority to road maintenance \nand safety; (vi) effective control of overloading on roads; and (vii) enhancement of capacity of \nroad sector agencies. From the MTDF, NHA undertook preparation of the National Highway \nDevelopment Plan (NHDP).2 \n \n7.  With passenger traffic growing annually at 12.64% and freight traffic at 6.13%, 439 billion \npassenger-km of passenger traffic and 198 billion tons-km of freight traffic are expected to be \nhandled  by  roads  by  2010.  As  a  result,  the  NHDP  provides  for  the  improvement  and \nrehabilitation of about 6,500 km of existing roads and construction of 2,500 km of new roads \n(Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Summary of Planned Roads (2005\u20132010) \n(kilometers) \nNo.  Description  Improvements New  Total \nConstruction \n     \n1.

The NHDP focuses on consolidating existing assets and providing linkages from the \nmain  road  system  to  remote  areas  and  subregional  border  crossings.  Main  areas  for \nimprovement/upgrading are (i) completion of the Makran Coastal Road, (ii) Lyari Expressway, \n(iii) Indus Highway Phase III, (iv) Gwadar\u2013Turbat\u2013Hoshab section, (v) World Bank financed N5 \nhighway improvement, (vi) Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh, (vii) Kuchlak\u2013Zhob, (viii) Karachi\u2013Hub\u2013Kakar, \nand (ix) Hub\u2013Uthal N25.  \n \n9.  Using the NHDP as the basis for undertaking the 10-year implementation plan, ending in \n2014/15, the Government identified (i) public sector development projects totaling PRs138.5 \nbillion ($2.30 billion), and (ii) private sector investment projects totaling PRs30.8 billion ($0.51 \nbillion).  Financing  for  public  sector  development  projects  is  forecast  to  be  sourced  from \nmultilateral and bilateral agencies for a total estimated amount of PRs89.7 billion (65%); the \nGovernment will provide approximately PRs48.8 billion (35%) using internal resources. Private \nsector investment projects will be financed by public-private partnership modalities (para. 14). A \nsummary of the NHDP in terms of funding requirements is given in Table 2 and a detailed \nsummary of public sector development projects is in Appendix 3. The investment program \nsubprojects are selected from NHDP\u2019s public sector development projects. Their eligibility for \nfunding  from  ADB  resources  will  be  subject  to  detailed  feasibility  studies  and  satisfactory \ncompliance with the project eligibility criteria.  \n                                                 \n2  The NHDP is reflected in the Government\u2019s MTDF 2005\u20132010, approved on 27 May 2005. \n \n ", "  3\nTable 2: Summary of the National Highway Development Plan (2005/06\u20132009/10) \n(PRs million) \nItem  PRs billion $ million\nPublic Sector Development Projects   138.5 2,308.3\nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Projects  30.8 513.3\nTotal  169.3 2,821.6\n     \nFunded by:     \nMultilateral Agencies  89.7 1,495.0\nPublic-Private Partnerships  30.8 513.3\nGovernment  48.8 813.3\nTotal  169.3 2,821.6\nSource: National Highway Authority.   \n3.  The National Highway Network \n10.  The  national  highway  network  requires  significant  upgrading  to  support  the  current \naccelerated  growth  of  the  national  economy  and  rapid  expansion  of  subregional  trade. \nSubstantially increased funding of NHA is projected under the MTDF. Work to date has focused \non upgrading the Grand Trunk Route N5 and the Indus Highway N55, both major national \nnorth\u2013south routes, from a 2-lane single carriageway to either a 4-lane single or a 2-lane dual \ncarriageway. Some key subregional sections of the national highway remain as single-lane \nroads,  often  in  deteriorated  condition  and  incompatible  with  use  by  through  traffic.  Other \nsections require urgent double-laning to avoid crippling congestion. Bypasses are required for \nmany cities and towns that are totally unsuited to the passage of heavy vehicles typically used \nfor subregional traffic. \n \n11.  Pakistan  is  ideally  located  to  act  as  a  hub  for  subregional  transport  and  to  take \nadvantage of the subregion\u2019s rapidly improving political situation for the development of transit \nand cross-border trade and commerce. Pakistan\u2019s road corridors offer the shortest route to the \nsea by several hundred km for landlocked Afghanistan, Central Asia, Xinjiang province of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic China, and parts of the Russian Federation. However, physical, institutional, \nand other constraints currently prevent Pakistan from taking full advantage of its location. The \npotential for increased trade through improved trade facilitation, rehabilitated transport links, \nefficient cross-border movements, and increased efficiency at ports is highly significant for the \nPakistan economy. In addition, under the transit trade agreement with Afghanistan, in place for \nmore than a decade, approximately 88% of Afghan exports pass through Pakistan, while 47% of \nAfghanistan\u2019s imports also pass through Pakistan. The proposed Investment Program provides \nPakistan with an opportunity to play a catalytic role in the development of such transport \ninitiatives, thereby enhancing subregional cooperation in addition to promoting its domestic \ndevelopment. \n \n12.  The highways to be improved under the Investment Program have local, provincial, \nnational, and subregional importance. The north\u2013south corridors via the N25 and N65 connect \nSindh and Balochistan provinces and are key subregional routes connecting Pakistan with \nAfghanistan  and  Central  Asia.  The  east\u2013west  corridors via  the  N50  and  the N70  connect \nBalochistan with North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Punjab. These routes are primary \nsubregional corridors connecting Afghanistan and Iran with Pakistan and India. N50 is part of \nthe key future corridor between Xinjiang province of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the new \ndeep-water port of Gwadar. N80 will be a future alternative route to the Khyber Pass and \nprovide the Islamabad\u2013Kabul link with the shortest distance in Afghanistan. The N35 section \n \n \n ", "4   \nforms the southern approach to the Karakoram Highway linking Pakistan and Xinjiang province, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, a corridor of rapidly increasing importance for trade and tourism.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Challenges \n \n13.  Subregional Competitiveness. With evident political goodwill in place and growing \npressure from consumers in the subregion for improved access to international markets, the \nstage is set for a transformation in trading patterns, with particularly beneficial prospects for \nPakistan. Pakistan does however face strong competition from Iran for subregional trade. Iran \nhas  a  better  developed  highway  network,  a  more  efficient  trucking  industry,  and  better \nfunctioning and more secure ports and transit routes. It is also actively pursuing cross-border \nand  transit  traffic  opportunities  with  Afghanistan.  All  of  the  logistics  chain  will  need  to  be \nimproved for Pakistan to increase its share of transit traffic. While Pakistan has the advantage of \nvery low road freight rates, this is offset by inefficient operation, delays to shipments, and \ndamage to goods in transit; overcoming them is a time-consuming process because of the large \nnumber of stakeholders involved. ADB, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \nand  World  Bank  have  supported  the  establishment  of  the  National  Trade  and  Transport \nFacilitation Committee to accelerate the process. This committee and its subcommittees have \nmade  progress  on  (i)  developing  and  improving  the  goods  declaration  form  and  transport \nclearance documents, (ii) developing a minimum standard of professional qualifications and \nstandard training conditions for freight forwarders, and (iii) reviewing and improving various acts \nfor the carriage of goods (i.e., Road Act, Sea Act, Air Act, and Marine Insurance Act). \n \n14.  Private Sector Participation. The Pakistan economy in recent years has continued to \nimprove and gross domestic product growth accelerated to 8.4% in 2005, the highest in the last \ntwo decades. To maintain the achieved economic growth on a sustained basis, the Government \nhas  placed  heavy  emphasis  on  investing  in  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  requirements.  The \nNHDP  identifies  projects  valued  at  approximately  PRs30.8  billion  for  public-private  sector \nfinancing. However, NHA has experienced difficulties in attracting private sector investments \nbecause of the lack of a legal framework for ensuring private sector transactions. Under ADB-\nfinanced technical assistance (TA),3 NHA is receiving assistance in preparing the necessary \ndocumentation and evaluation of proposals for private sector financing (para. 28) achievements \nunder the TA. The Government has identified seven projects for private sector opportunities \ncomprising (i) interchanges and flyovers, (ii) motorways and carriageways, and (iii) tunnels \n(Appendix 4). \n \n15.  Road Safety. The fatality rate on Pakistan\u2019s road network remains among the highest in \nAsia.4  The  causes  are  high  speeds,  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor  discipline  and \nenforcement of rules, and poor condition of vehicles. Road safety audits are not conducted \nroutinely for new and improved roads. The road safety problem is exacerbated by lack of \nawareness and poor knowledge of road safety matters among the general public and road \nusers. National and provincial efforts and coordination are not rigorous, and responsibilities and \naccountability  of  institutions  and  provincial  departments  are  not  clearly  delineated.  More \nintensive efforts in educating and training drivers, together with awareness building are required \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Facilitating Public-Private Partnership \nInitiatives in National Highway Development. Manila (TA 4508, approved on 20 December for $150,000). \n4  Pakistan had 18.69 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in 1992. This was lower than in Bangladesh (85.58) and India \n(25.27), but higher than in Southeast Asia (5\u201315 per 10,000 vehicles), and far above the countries with the lowest \nnumber of fatalities such as the United Kingdom (1.60) and Japan (1.74). Source: ADB.1995. Technical Assistance \nfor Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila. \n \n ", "  5\nto address the high fatality rate. Under the NWFP Road Development Sector and Subregional \nConnectivity Project,5 the National Highway and Motorway Police is about to commence a pilot \nproject on road safety for sections of the national highway in NWFP. Among other items, the \npilot project will address organizational and staffing arrangements as part of preparing the \ntraining programs. Policy dialogue for the Investment Program will track the findings of this pilot \nstudy and incorporate its recommendations into NHA operations. \n \n16.  Road Maintenance. NHA is responsible for maintaining approximately 8,320 km of \nnational highways, which carry approximately 80% of the country\u2019s commercial traffic. Because \nthe national highway network is under tremendous strain, NHA established the dedicated Road \nAsset  Management  Directorate  to  oversee  maintenance  operations.  Despite  the  gap  in \nmaintenance needs and resources, NHA through its gradual increase in toll receipts, has been \nable to achieve significant progress since 2002/03 by increasing the quality of maintenance \nthrough periodic overlays, providing rigid pavement at places of rutting, replacing/rehabilitating \nold bridges, etc. In addition, NHA has embarked on a major axle-overload control program \nthrough installation of weigh stations and other suitable measures to control the damage caused \nby overloaded trucks. As per the latest studies undertaken in 2005, NHA requires approximately \nPRs6.3 billion ($106.0 million) per annum to maintain the national highway network. Currently \napproximately  PRs4.0  billion  ($67.0  million)  is  received  annually  from  toll  receipts  and \napproximately another PRs1 billion ($16.7 million) is provided by the Government. NHA is \ncurrently negotiating with the Government to increase funding by linking it to the goods and \nservices tax levy on fuel products.  \n \n2.  External Assistance \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s support for roads has been developed in close collaboration with the Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation and World Bank. ADB has met regularly with both agencies in the \npreparation of this Investment Program. They have shared their respective project preparation \nmaterials and studies, and presented materials for the preparation of the Government\u2019s MTDF. \nSince  2000,  Pakistan  has  received  substantial  assistance  from  ADB,  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation, and World Bank (Appendix 5). ADB\u2019s provincial project financing \nassistance commenced with Sindh (2001 for $200 million), Punjab (2002 for $150 million), \nBalochistan  (2003  for  185.7  million),  and  NWFP  (2004  for  $243.2  million).  The  provincial \nprojects concentrated on provincial highways and farm-to-market roads. For the Balochistan \nand NWFP projects, ADB financed sections of the national highways that form part of the \nregional connectivity network with Afghanistan and associated civil works for border facilities at \nChaman (Balochistan for $3.5 million) and Torkham (NWFP for $2.3 million). \n \n18.  Since 2001, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation has financed the construction \nworks for the Kohat Tunnel for a total of $79 million. In 2001, the World Bank financed the Trade \nand Transport Facilitation Project for $3 million, and in 2003, the Highway Rehabilitation Project \nfor $200 million. During the last 4 years, the Trade and Transport Facilitation Project has been \nactively assisting the Ministry of Commerce in reviewing, improving, and providing institutional \ncapacity building for all major agencies associated with the logistical chain for transportation of \ngoods. Under this project, the Government implemented the single administrative document, the \ngoods declaration form, and is now pilot testing it as part of the electronic document exchange \nexercise. At the request of the Government, the World Bank is preparing the follow-on 2006 \nTrade Facilitation Project. In addition, the National Logistics Cell, a Government agency, is \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the North-West Frontier Province Road Development Sector and Subregional \nConnectivity Project. Manila (Loan 2103/2104 for $301.2 million). \n \n \n ", "6   \nundertaking all border improvements and, in addition to the Pakistan Railway, is authorized to \nfreight transit goods for Afghanistan. Overall, trade facilitation of freight traffic is adequately \ncovered by the Government and the World Bank project. The World Bank\u2019s ongoing Highway \nRehabilitation6 Project focuses on about 856 km of highway improvements along the national \nhighways N5 and M9, with implementation over 5 years. To date the World Bank project has \ncommenced civil works on approximately 348 km of the project target. \n \n  3.  Lessons Learned \n \n19.  Prior  to  2000,  ADB-financed  road  projects  focused  on  farm-to-market  needs  and \nselective interventions in the national highway network. From 2001 onward, ADB\u2019s investment \nstrategy  shifted  to  more  focused  interventions  on  provincial  and  rural  access  roads  on  a \nprovince-by-province basis. From 2003 onward, in line with the Government\u2019s plan to integrate \nPakistan\u2019s economy into the regional economy, ADB commenced financing sections of the \nnational highway network with linkages to Afghanistan, on a selective basis. The proposed \nInvestment Program is ADB\u2019s first major intervention into NHA\u2019s operations on an integrated \nbasis combining project investments and sector reforms. With respect to ADB support for road \nprojects in Pakistan, experience indicates the following actions are generally important for \navoidance of delays in implementation: (i) advance procurement of civil works and recruitment \nof supervision consultants; (ii) early establishment of project implementation units (PIUs); (iii) \nstrict prequalification criteria; (iv) advance action for land acquisition, resettlement, shifting of \nutilities, and clearance of right-of-way; and (v) increasing the authority of the independent \nengineer under the contract to ensure efficient and quick decision making during execution. \nExperience under the current ADB-financed Balochistan and NWFP provincial road projects \nsuggests  that  highway  projects  require  (i)  early  preparation  of  project  pro  forma  (PC-1) \ndocuments for internal government approvals, (ii) early preparation and provision of adequate \nresources to implement advance procurement actions, (iii) recruitment and active involvement of \nstaff in advance preparation of the project, (iv) limiting the executing and implementing agencies \nto  one  body,  (v)  early  commencement  of  training  for  executing  agency  staff  on  ADB \nprocurement policies and guidelines, and (vi) packaging of civil works and consulting services \ninto larger parcels for international competitive bidding. As part of the Investment Program, NHA \nhas undertaken early preparation steps by (i) appointing staff to senior positions in the project \nteam, including the project coordination officer and the project directors for the three sample \nsubprojects; (ii) completing and submitting the pro forma project document for Government \napproval before loan negotiations for the batch 1 and batch 2 subprojects; (iii) issuing requests \nfor  proposal  documents  for  recruiting  construction  supervision  consultants;  (iv)  preparing \nprequalification of contractors documents and bidding documents for civil works; (v) convening a \nbusiness  opportunities  workshop  for  informing  international  contractors  about  future  NHA \nproject opportunities and requesting their participation; (vi) holding dedicated training seminars \non ADB procurement and recruitment of consultants procedures (conducted by ADB staff); and \n(vii) commencing preparation of feasibility studies for the five batch 2 subprojects (para. 41).  \n \n  4.  Asian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2005\u20132006)7  focused  objectives  for \nnational highways on supporting subregional cooperation, improving cross-border facilities and \nagreements,  improving  trade  facilitation,  and  improving  transport  efficiency  on  the  main \ntransport corridors in Pakistan. During preparation of the Investment Program, ADB found that \nthe Government was using its own resources to improve cross-border facilities. Support for \n                                                 \n6  World Bank-financed project, Highway Rehabilitation Project, approved on 10 November 1993, for $200 million. \n7  ADB. 2005. Country and Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Pakistan. Manila. \n \n ", "  7\nsubregional cooperation and cross-border agreements are to be undertaken as part of the ADB-\nsponsored Central and South Asian Transport and Trade Forum8 initiatives, which include \nreviewing regional transit arrangements. Trade facilitation activities are being undertaken by the \nWorld Bank-financed 2001 Transport and Trade Facilitation Project, and at the request of the \nGovernment, by a follow-on trade facilitation project being prepared for 2006 processing by the \nWorld Bank. Classifying a project as subregional has been difficult as the project is required to \nquantify the project economic benefits accruing to the subregional countries. This has not been \nfeasible due to difficulty securing accurate trade statistics. Because of recent developments \nwhereby most of the original objectives were being addressed by other Government initiatives \nand  to  avoid  duplication  of  efforts,  the  focus  of  the  Investment  Program  was  modified  to \nconcentrate  on  enhancing  the  capacity  of  NHA  to  become  a  sustainable  and  efficient \norganization to operate and maintain a sustainable national highway network.9 This modified \nfocus supports the country strategy and program update objectives of sustainable pro-poor \ngrowth and the Government\u2019s decision as part of its debt management strategy to only borrow \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources for priority infrastructure projects and provincial resource \nmanagement programs. In addition, at the first management review meeting, ADB management \napproved increasing ADB\u2019s cost sharing to 80% to support the Government\u2019s need to mobilize \nresources in support of urgent infrastructure development. \n \n21.  As highlighted in the Government\u2019s MTDF, Pakistan is planning to undertake a large \nprogram of improving the national highway network over the next 10 years at a total cost of \nPRs169.3  billion  ($2.82  billion).  To  finance  the  program,  the  Government  is  reliant  upon \nfinancing from bilateral and multilateral agencies, domestic banks, and private sector sponsors. \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide an MFF under which ADB will provide individual \nloans  for  subprojects  based  on  the  completion  of  feasibility  studies  and  advance  project \npreparation activities in accordance with the Framework Financing Agreement (FFA) (para. 49). \nBecause of the potential large scale of lending, a programmatic10 approach will be adopted and \nprojects will be developed in a sequential and progressive manner. ADB\u2019s long-term sector \nstrategy is to create an enabling environment for the efficient and sustainable development of \nthe highway system to meet the needs of the public for increased mobility and efficient cargo \nmovement.  \n \n  5.  Policy Dialogue \n \n22.  ADB has been engaged in policy dialogue with the Government and NHA since 2001, \nand has provided loans and TA in support of critical policy and institutional reform processes. \nThe major national policy reform actions taken to date include (i) substantive preparation of a \nnational transport policy (NTP); (ii) preparation of rolling five-year medium-term investment and \nmaintenance plans; (iii) tolling of sections of the national highway network and use of toll \nreceipts for road development and maintenance programs; (iv) setting up of the Road Asset \nManagement Directorate, fully functioning since 2003; (v) enforcement of the National Highways \nSafety Ordinance and extending it to cover additional road lengths in each successive year; (vi) \ncollection  of  monetary  penalties  from  2003  onward  for  violation  of  traffic  ordinances  and \nallocating the collections toward road development and maintenance programs; (vii) continued \n                                                 \n8  This is an ADB-sponsored initiative, which commenced in 2003, with the objective to facilitate transport connectivity \nand trade in the subregion by focusing on (i) customs harmonization, (ii) law enforcement on drug and human \ntrafficking, (iii) border crossing facilities, and (iv) regional transit trade agreements. \n9  The original project tile was changed from Subregional Connectivity and Trade Facilitation Project to National \nHighway Development Sector Investment Program. \n10 The approach should be distinguished from a program loan lending modality, which is essentially based on policy \nreform. The loans are essentially designed as investment projects that will be prepared just like typical highway \nprojects, but with the policy reform elements to be implemented in a systematic, sequential, and coherent manner. \n \n \n ", "8   \nimplementation of the program to decrease NHA staff strength; (viii) introduction of standard \noperating procedures for financial management and an accompanying financial manual; (ix) \nrecruitment of financial experts for NHA; and (x) installation of weighbridges to control axle \nloads. \n \n23.  Although significant progress has been made on major policy and institutional issues, a \nnumber of areas remain to be addressed before and during implementation of the Investment \nProgram. Subsequent to extensive policy dialogue with NHA, agreement was reached on the \nRoad Sector Development Framework (RSDF), and adopting a programmatic approach (para. \n21).  The  RSDF  comprises  major  policy  reform  actions  and  implementation  target  dates \n(Appendix 6). Because the Investment Program will be implemented over 10 years, the RSDF \nwill be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 (2006\u20132008) will focus on agreed milestones, \nwhich will act as building blocks for the remainder of the Investment Program. Phase 2 will be \nbased  on  the  progress  achieved  during  phase  1,  and  identification  of  additional  capacity-\nbuilding measures including sector reforms required to ensure sustainable NHA development. \nThe policy reform milestones (contained in the RSDF) agreed with NHA will be reviewed for \ncompliance,  as  part  of  the  review  process  for  all  individual  periodic  financing  requests \nscheduled to be completed by 2011. For implementation of the RSDF, NHA will be assisted by \nconsultants with the requisite expertise (para. 63). \n \n24.  The RSDF focuses on five policy areas for improvement: (i) promulgating the NTP; (ii) \nfacilitating  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  in  road  construction,  maintenance,  and  toll \ncollection; (iii) providing NHA with institutional development and improving its strategic focus; \n(iv)  embedding  concern  for  road  safety  in  the  decision-making  process;  and  (v)  ensuring \nsustainable funding of road maintenance. The RSDF takes into consideration the initial findings \nof the Business Process Reengineering Study11 undertaken by  NHA-appointed consultants \nunder the World Bank financed Highway Rehabilitation Project. These actions accord with the \npolicy matrix requirements of the 2001 Road Sector Development Program loan (footnote 1). \n \na.  National Transport Policy \n \n25.  Government promulgation of the NTP and its implementation are a prerequisite for the \neffective  development  of  a  sustainable  and  cost-effective  transport  system.  The  recently \napproved MTDF12 represents an important step in developing the NTP, defining the investment \nneeds at the project level. The ongoing National Transport Master Plan Study13 will provide a \ncomprehensive  database  for  supporting  analysis  and  policy  making.  Developing  the  NTP \nprovides an opportunity for modal priorities to be reviewed; for intermodal opportunities to be \ndetermined; and for macro objectives, responsibilities, and funding mechanisms to be reviewed. \nThe NTP will provide the framework within which the infrastructure development and institutional \ncomponents of this Investment Program and ADB\u2019s planned subsequent sector interventions \ncan be most effective. This will ensure that their benefits are realized and that implementation is \nstructured to ensure seamless integration with other NTP initiatives. \n \n26.  In  addition  to  the  appropriate  technical  research  and  financial  and  economic \nassessment, developing the NTP will require detailed discussions with stakeholders (including \nprovincial governments, railways, civil aviation, roads, seaports, inland waterways, and users). \n                                                 \n11 The Business Process Reengineering Study focuses on streamlining NHA procedures for core activities, including \naccounting and finance, administration and general operations, and computerization. \n12 The  MTDF  2005\u20132010,  prepared  by  the  Planning  Commission,  represents  the  Government\u2019s  infrastructure \ninvestment program for all sectors. \n13 The first phase of the National Transport Master Plan study, financed by the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, focuses on the collection of transport statistics and is expected to be completed by March 2006. \n \n ", "  9\nTo achieve an effective NTP, the consultation process must be effectively managed. ADB has \nprovided assistance in the initial preparation of an NTP document, and the consultation process \nis about to start. To assist the Government, ADB is providing TA14 to support the consultation \nprocess. The Investment Program will assist the Government in developing the NTP, which will \nprovide NHA with an enabling environment for institutional development. The NTP is expected \nto be promulgated by 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M1). \n \nb.  Enhancing Public-Private Partnerships in the Provision of Road \nTransport Infrastructure \n \n27.  NHA is faced with a major funding challenge to implement the MTDF. PPP financing is \nproposed as part of the solution to finance 18% of the 2005\u20132010 funding requirement. Given \nlimited progress with PPP, this target places a considerable demand on NHA's management \ncapabilities. Private sector participation should be developed at a rate that accords with NHA's \nability  to  effectively  manage  it.  Poorly  executed  PPP  projects  not only  fail  to  realize their \npotential benefits, but they may discourage future initiatives. \n \n28.  During TA to facilitate PPP initiatives in national highway development (footnote 3), the \nADB consultants assisted NHA in (i) preparing a revised draft policy and regulatory framework \nfor private sector participation in national highways, motorways, tunnels, and bridges, which is \nnow under consideration by the Cabinet Committee for Investments; (ii) preparing an action plan \nfor improving the legal and regulatory framework for private sector participation; (iii) developing \ncomprehensive PPP tender documents for future PPP projects; (iv) undertaking a preliminary \nreview and improvement of NHA\u2019s proposed build-operate-transfer projects over the next 5 \nyears;  and  (v)  reviewing  institutional  arrangements  necessary  to  carry  out  PPP  projects, \nincluding creating a PPP cell in NHA. \n \n29.  The TA notes that NHA should reevaluate the PPP program, which is seen as optimistic. \nTo select activities for ADB financing under the proposed Public-Private Initiative for National \nHighway Development Project in 2006,15 a full review of the current PPP financing strategy is \nnecessary by 31 July 2006 (Project milestone M2-1). The bidding and implementation progress \nof the 2006 PPP project will be considered prior to commencing the midterm review, scheduled \nfor  June  2008.  NHA  agreed  to  a  target  value  of  total  PPP  projects  of  approximately           \nPRs60 billion, which will be prepared for bid invitations by the time a project(s) is selected for \nthe proposed ADB financing of a second PPP project in 2008. The pipeline of PPP projects is \ntargeted to be available by 31 July 2008 (Project milestone M2-2). Project preparation requires \nthat a funding proposal be developed such that the expected financial internal rate of return is \nsufficiently robust to attract private sector participation. \n \n    c.  Institutional Development of NHA \n \n30.  Network/Business Planning and Institutional Reform. NHA has been called upon to \ndevelop,  operate,  and  maintain  a  sustainable  national  highway  network  to  meet  the \nrequirements of the public on an efficient and cost-effective basis. To successfully deliver on \nthis challenge, NHA must transform itself into a service-driven organization with a strong service \nbase for road users, which makes appropriate use of internal and external resources to deliver \noutcomes that match the needs of the community. Toward this goal, the Investment Program \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Transport Policy Support. Manila (TA \n4400, approved on 30 September, for $290,000). \n15 In the 2005\u20132006 country strategy and program update (footnote 7), the Public-Private Initiative for National \nHighway Development Project, for $50 million, is shown as a firm loan for 2006. \n \n \n ", "10   \nwill incorporate a component designed to provide TA to the Government to help clarify NHA \ngoals, define the form of the organization most likely to efficiently support the achievement of \nthese goals, support the transformation of NHA into that new form, and build the institutional \ncapacity and develop the improved funding options required to ensure the sustainability of the \nnew organization. An essential first step in the institutional reform process will be for NHA to \nclearly chart its agenda, outline the capability improvements it must undertake to successfully \npursue its agenda, analyze the legal and administrative regulatory constrains that may impede \nthe pursuit of its agenda, and articulate an action plan to address each of the related issues. \n \n31.  TA will be provided to NHA under the Investment Program to develop a strategy for \nprogressive federalizing of key provincial highways to establish an optimal national highway \nnetwork and for the preparation of a network investment plan 2007\u20132011 for this network, \ndrawing on the database being established in the National Transport Master Plan study for \nproject  appraisal.  Delivery  of  the  network/business  plan together  with  an  NHA  institutional \nreform  program  and  associated  time-bound  action  plans  is  targeted  for  31  January  2007 \n(Project  milestone  M3-1).  Government  endorsement  of  the  plans/program  and  actions  are \nexpected by 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M3-2). \n \n32.  Transparency and Accountability Policies. Road users and taxpayers need to be \ngiven a role in reviewing the needs, priorities, and effectiveness of road system management. \nThis  will  require  improvements  in  NHA  practices  with  regard  to  disclosure  and  public \naccountability.  NHA  will  need  to  significantly  increase  transparency  in  all  aspects  of  its \noperations from hiring staff to financial management. Supportive measures should include (i) \nbasing programming, scheduling, and budgeting of rehabilitation and maintenance expenditures \non  rational  criteria  and  clearly  defined  targets  that  maximize  economic  returns  and  allow \nperformance to be judged; (ii) introducing a comprehensive program of community consultation \nand  a  process  for incorporating  the  outcomes  of  this consultation in  decision making;  (iii) \ncontinually developing adequate and appropriate procurement guidelines and processes; (iv) \nestablishing a website for registering grievances associated with the Investment Program; and \n(v) establishing audit processes using independent experts to monitor performance of all these \naspects. NHA\u2019s Vigilance Department reports independently to the Ministry of Communications \nand the NHA chairperson. The department also regularly submits reports to the NHA executive \nboard.  NHA  agreed  to  establish  a  website,  maintained  by  the  Vigilance  Department,  for \nregistering complaints associated with the Investment Program. The website will be functioning \nby 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M3-3). \n \n  d.  Road Safety on National Highway Network \n \n33.  Pakistan\u2019s road accident rates are among the highest in Asia due to a number of \nfactors,  including  inadequate  enforcement  of  safety  regulations,  an  ineffective  vehicle \ninspection  system,  and  inadequate  safety  training.  With  increasing  traffic  and  a  growing \nnational  highway  network,  NHA  is  urgently  required  to  establish  clear  primary  portfolio \nresponsibility for national highway safety program delivery and to establish a closer liaison with \nthe National Highway and Motorway Police. The Investment Program will address the issue of \nroad  safety  by  supporting  (i)  design  of  a  national  highway  safety  program,  and  (ii) \nestablishment of a road safety cell within NHA by 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M4-1). An \nimproved robust measurement and quarterly reporting of road accidents and the causes and \nimpacts of accidents as a part of a national road safety policy and targets are also required. \nUnder the NWFP Road Development Sector and Connectivity Project (footnote 5), the National \nHighway and Motorway Police is undertaking a pilot safety study on sample sections of the \nnational highway road in NWFP. The pilot study is expected to commence in November 2005 \n \n ", "  11\nand results from it will be incorporated in the Investment Program. An action plan acceptable to \nADB for institutionalizing the pilot study recommendations will be prepared by 30 June 2007 \n(Project milestone M4-2). \n \n  e.  Sustainable Delivery of Road Maintenance \n \n34.  Maintenance of the highway network requires constant improvement in the utilization of \ntechnical  expertise  and  maintenance  techniques.  NHA  has  implemented  the  Road  Asset \nManagement  Directorate  and  to  date  it  has  achieved  positive  results  in  planning  and \nimplementing  road  maintenance  activities.  The  Investment  Program  will  support  a \ncomprehensive review of the options for delivery of the NHA maintenance programs. Increased \noptions for effective outsourcing may be achieved by better packaging of maintenance and \nconstruction projects to foster the development of private sector provision. This could extend to \nmultiyear comprehensive contracts for the maintenance of specified sections of the network to \ndefined performance standards and the introduction of corridor maintenance schemes. Recent \nhighway  design  maintenance  (HDM)  analysis  based  on  the  NHA  maintenance  program \nconcluded that the average maintenance requirements will be approximately PRs6.3 billion per \nyear for the next 5 years. NHA currently receives net toll revenues of approximately PRs4 \nbillion per year; when combined with the Ministry of Finance maintenance grant of about PRs1 \nbillion per year, NHA is almost self-sustaining in terms of maintenance financing for the next 5 \nyears. For the remaining funding gap, NHA is currently discussing different proposals with the \nMinistry of Finance to ensure sustainable funding of the established road maintenance account. \nLikely funding services earmarked for the account include the goods and services tax levy \nimposed on fuel for road vehicles, collections from road tolls and weigh stations, right-of-way \ncommercialization, billboards, and police fine collections. These proposals should be delivered \nby 30 June 2006 (Project milestone M5-1). Government endorsement of the maintenance plan \nand its underwriting of the funding are programmed for 30 June 2007 (Project milestone M5-2). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n35.  The Investment Program is to advance policy reform in Pakistan to create an enabling \nenvironment for the efficient and sustainable development of the national highway network. It \nwill also support growth in trade by improving regional connectivity on the Asian highway \nnetwork  and  thereby  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  RSDF \n(Appendix 6) developed and agreed upon with NHA will serve as a plan for future lending to \nPakistan\u2019s  highway  sector.  The  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  achieve  two  specific \nobjectives. The first is to improve transport efficiency by (i) facilitating adoption of a national \ntransport policy, (ii) strengthening NHA performance in managing the national highway network, \n(iii) improving road safety, and (iv) improving road maintenance and road maintenance funding. \nThe  second  objective  is  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  road  sector  by  (i) \nincreasing outsourcing of road works, and (ii) exploring opportunities for private operation of \nNHA assets and activities along its right-of-way. To realize these objectives, the Investment \nProgram will comprise national highway improvements and institutional strengthening of NHA. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n36.  The Government\u2019s 10-year National Highway Infrastructure Program ending 2014/15 will \nbe implemented under the Investment Program by undertaking subprojects in three batches. \n \n \n ", "12   \nADB\u2019s MFF will be used to finance the Investment Program. The first batch represents three \nsample subprojects for which detailed designs have been completed and advance preparation \nactivities  are  substantially  complete  (paras.  38\u201340  and  Appendix  7).  The  second  batch \ncomprises five subprojects for which detailed engineering designs and feasibility studies are \ncurrently in progress (Appendix 7). These subprojects are expected to be ready for submission \nto ADB during 2007. The third batch of subprojects will be identified during implementation of \nthe Investment Program and is targeted for submission to ADB during 2009\u20132010. The policy \nreform component will be undertaken in two phases, the first phase (up to 2008) will focus on \nimplementation of the agreed RSDF, and the second phase will cover the remainder of the \ninvestment program period. \n \n37.  The Investment Program will have two components:  \n \n(i)  National highway improvement. Highways of the Pakistan domestic transport \nsystem serving interprovincial traffic among Balochistan, NWFP, Punjab, and \nSindh will be improved, along with selected national highways facilitating the \nmovement of freight traffic with Iran and Afghanistan, and the seaports located at \nKarachi and Qasim in Sindh with Afghanistan and the central Asian republics via \nTorkham (in NWFP) and Chaman (in Balochistan). In addition, the Investment \nProgram will provide vehicle parking and service facilities along the subproject \nhighway corridors (paras. 38-43). \n \n(ii)  Institutional strengthening of NHA. Assistance will be provided to facilitate \nfinalization of an NTP, facilitate PPP transactions, and build institutional capacity \nin network/business planning, road safety, and road maintenance (para. 44). \n \n1.  National Highway Improvements \n \na.  First Batch of Sample Subprojects \n \n38.  NHA  has  identified  three  subproject  roads  totaling  376  km  that  meet  the  agreed \nselection criteria (Appendix 8) and represent the typical geophysical, environmental, and social \nconditions throughout the highway network. NHA prepared the three sample subprojects and \nADB staff consultants completed the due diligence. Sample subproject preparation involved a \nfeasibility study; environmental, social, and resettlement assessments; detailed engineering; \nand preparation of bidding documents. The design approach and technical standards are in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n39.  The sample subprojects comprise (i) N25: Hub\u2013Uthal, widening and improving the Hub\u2013\nUthal section to 2-lane national standard road with 7.3 meter (m)-wide pavement and 3 m-wide \nshoulder  (84.5  km);  (ii)  N50:  Khanozai\u2013Zhob,  widening  and  improving  the  Khanozai\u2013Zhob \nsection to 2-lane national standard road with 7.3 m-wide pavement and 3 m-wide shoulder (255 \nkm), including construction of the Muslim Bagh bypass; and (iii) N70: Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh, \nexpanding the existing 2-lane road between Multan and Muzaffargarh to 4-lane standard road \nwith shoulder (20 km) and construction of a 4-lane bypass (16.5 km) to avoid the Muzaffargarh \nurban area.  \n \n40.  The justification for selection of the three sample subprojects, namely (i) N25, Hub\u2013\nUthal, (ii) N50, Khanozai\u2013Zhob, and (iii) N70, Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh is as follows: \n \n \n ", "  13\n(i)  N25: Hub\u2013Uthal (84.5 km). The Hub\u2013Uthal section of N25 provides the only \nroute from Karachi to the newly opened Makran Coastal Road, the 653 km \nCoastal Highway N10, which services the new deepwater port at Gwadar and \nconnects to Gabd and the Iranian border. In the north, N25 connects to N40, \nwhich runs west to Iran via Taftan. On completion of this subproject, all but the \n40  km  Bela\u2013Kararo  section  of  N25  will  have  been  upgraded  to  a  7.3  m \ncarriageway. ADB is currently financing the upgrading of the Kalat\u2013Quetta and \nQuetta\u2013Chaman  sections  of  N25  under  the  Balochistan  Road  Development \nSector Project loan.16 \n \n(ii)  N50: Khanozai\u2013Zhob (255 km). N50 is of considerable strategic importance, \nrunning parallel to the border with Afghanistan and being the closest national \nhighway  to  the  border.  It  provides  by  far  the  most  direct  route  between \nBalochistan  and  the  north  and  northeast  of  the  country.  It  starts  from  the \nintersection with N25, at km711, some 26 km north of Quetta and 106 km south \nof the Afghan border crossing at Chaman. N50 runs east via the important local \ncenters  of  Muslin  Bagh,  Qila  Saifullah,  Zhob,  and  Mughalkot,  ending  at  an \nintersection with the Indus Highway N55 at D.I. Khan. The major east\u2013west \nhighway,  the  N70  starts  from  the  N50  in  Qila  Saifullah,  providing  a  direct \nconnection  to  the  Punjab  via  D.G.  Khan  and  Multan.  After  the  planned \nimprovement of N50 and N70, these highways will be the main routes between \nQuetta  in  northern  Balochistan  and  NWFP  and/or  Punjab,  and  will  serve \nsubregional traffic on the corridor from Iran, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian \nrepublics. \n \n(iii)  N70: Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh (36.5 km). The N70 runs west from the N5 at Multan \nto the N50 at Qila Saifullah, a distance of 441 km. It is the most direct route \nbetween southern Punjab and northern Balochistan, and onward to southern \nAfghanistan (via the N50/N25 to Chaman) and to Iran (via the N50/N40). It will \nalso serve in the future as a subregional route between India, Afghanistan, and \nIran.  N70  passes  through  several  important  intermediate  cities  and  towns, \nincluding Muzaffargarh, D.G. Khan, Bewata, and Loralai. Local traffic on the \nMultan\u2013Muzaffargarh  section  is  heavy,  while  the  Multan\u2013D.G.  Khan  section \nprovides an important connection between the N5 and the Indus Highway N55, \nthe two main north\u2013south highways. \n \nb.  Second Batch of Subprojects \n \n41.  The second batch, comprising five subprojects totaling about 460 km of roads, will be \nstudied  using  the  selection  criteria  involving  technical  and  economic  feasibility,  social \nassessment  and  resettlement,  consideration  for  indigenous  people,  environmental \nconsiderations, stakeholder consultations, and availability of counterpart funds in coordination \nwith the agreed selection criteria in Appendix 8.  \n \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2003.

Subprojects to be undertaken in the third batch will be identified and studied during \nimplementation of the second batch subprojects.  \n \n43.  The Investment Program will provide vehicle parking and service areas, strategically \nlocated along the project highway corridors serving domestic and subregional traffic in Pakistan. \nThe component will include development of serviced parking areas and wayside facilities, and \ncover  consulting  services  for  design  and  supervision  and  civil  works.  The  facilities  to  be \nprovided include (i) paved parking, (ii) emergency repairs, (iii) restaurants, (iv) refueling, (v) \nprayer area, (vi) overnight accommodation, and (vii) emergency medical services. The facilities \nwill be leased out to private operators on a long-term basis. \n \n  2.  Institutional Strengthening of NHA \n \n44.  The  Investment  Program  will  undertake  implementation  of  identified  policy  reform \nactions agreed with NHA and the Government (paras. 23\u201334). Areas identified for policy and \ninstitutional development include (i) formulation of an NTP, (ii) enhancement of PPP in road \ninfrastructure development, (iii) institutional capacity building of NHA including network/business \nplanning and transparency and accountability policies, (iv) national highway road safety, and (v) \nroad maintenance. In addition, the implementation of a computerized management information \nsystem  for  daily  traffic  flow  analysis  will  be  undertaken  as  part  of  improvements  for  road \noperations. The policy reforms to be undertaken during the second phase (2009\u20132015) will \ninclude a review of the outcomes from the first phase, updating of the RSDF, and formulation of \nsecond generation reforms to be implemented during the second phase. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Subregional Development \n \n45.  The majority of the project corridors form part of the Asian highway network and the \ntrade corridors identified by the Central and South Asian Transport and Trade Forum. Together \nwith  ongoing  and  planned  road  projects  in  Afghanistan,  the  Investment  Program  supports \nsubregional cooperation through physical and nonphysical improvements of critical sections of \nN25, N50, and N70, which all form part of the transport corridors for Afghanistan, Iran, and \nIndia. In addition to providing improved access to ports in southern Pakistan, the Investment \nProgram will facilitate the economic and social development of the corridor areas through \nimproved access and easier movement of people and goods; these help reduce poverty and \nsupport pro-poor economic growth.  \n \n2.  Capacity Building for Environmental and Social Assessments \n \n46.  NHA  lacks  staff,  expertise,  and  capacity  to  carry  out  environmental  and  social \nassessment requirements. To address these constraints, NHA has agreed to establish separate \norganization cells for these assessment activities. To assist NHA to fulfill the requirements, a \nprogram with actions to enhance in-house capacity will be developed and implemented under \nthe Investment Program. A consultant team on environment and social development will be \nrecruited as part of the project management office to help NHA prepare and implement the \ncapacity-building measures. \n \n \n ", "  15\n3.  Multitranche Financing Modality \n \n47.  Under the MFF, the amount and timing of financing requests will be at the discretion of \nthe  Government,  subject  to  meeting  the  terms  and  conditions  of the  FFA,  and  be  mainly \ndetermined by the progress achieved under preceding individual loans approved under the MFF \nand NHA\u2019s readiness for new subprojects. The MFF provides NHA with the confidence that \nfinancing of the agreed Investment Program is now undertaken with certainty and financial \nefficiency, because financing will only be made available when the projects are ready. As a \nresult, only projects ready for implementation will be financed, thereby reducing borrowing costs \nand speeding up implementation.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n48.  The total cost of NHDP is $2.3 billion, out of which the Investment Program is estimated \nat $966.8 million equivalent, inclusive of taxes, duties, and interest and other charges on the \nloan during construction (Table 3; Appendix 9 provides details). \n \nTable 3: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nItem  Total \n1.

Financing Plan \n \n49.  The Government has requested financing for up to an equivalent of $770 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Investment Program. The Investment \nProgram will be financed by utilizing the MFF17 under which separate multiple loans will be \nextended to finance a range of subprojects under the Investment Program subject to submission \nof related periodic financing requests (PFRs) by the Government. The Government and NHA \nhave entered into a FFA with ADB. The FFA satisfies the requirements set forth in Appendix 4 \nof the Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities (see footnote 17). The Government is required \nto comply with the FFA requirements. The Government intends to finance NHDP by submitting \nfive PFRs by 31 December 2011. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted to ADB \nthe first PFR in the amount of $180 million. The first PFR is presented to the Board, together \nwith the FFA. The investment capacity of NHA was determined by its financial capacity after \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2005.

The \nADB loans will finance civil works, consulting services, land and resettlement costs, project \nmanagement, incremental costs, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction. \n \n50.  The proposed ADB loans will have an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank-offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  rate  system.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Government \nhas the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest rate regime for each loan. \nThe specific terms of each loan will depend on the circumstances of the related PFR within the \nparameters of the LIBOR-based loan window. \n  \n51.  In addition, the Government requested a loan of $3.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to finance the institutional strengthening component. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n52.  For all the loans, the Borrower will be Pakistan, which will pass on the proceeds of the \nloan to NHA, the Executing Agency, in local currency in accordance with the Government\u2019s \npolicies in this regard.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Investment Program Management \n \n53.  NHA  will  act  as  the  executing  agency  for  the  national  highway  improvement  and \ninstitutional  strengthening  components  of  the  Investment  Program.  An  investment  program \ncoordinating committee, chaired by the NHA chairperson, will be responsible for monitoring the \nuse of loan funds and overall implementation performance. The committee will meet at least \nquarterly.  Two  project  management  offices  will  be  instituted:  one  for  the  institutional \nstrengthening of NHA component and the second for implementation of the national highway \nimprovements. Members of the investment program coordinating committee and the two project \nmanagement offices, and the implementation arrangements are shown in Appendix 10. The \npolicy formulation and coordination office will be headed by the NHA member (planning) and the \n \n ", "  17\ninvestment program management office by the NHA member (ADB-NHDSIP). The principal \ncoordination officer reporting to the general manager (NHDSIP) has been appointed.  \n \n54.  NHA will establish a PIU for each subproject. The PIU will be adequately staffed within 2 \nmonths of loan effectiveness or before the award of civil works contracts, whichever is earlier. \nEach PIU will be headed by a project director (at the director level) and in addition to NHA \nstaffing, the unit will be complemented with an externally recruited construction supervision \nteam. They will be assisted by deputy project directors for each civil works contract package. \nNHA has advanced project preparation activities by appointing project directors for the batch 1 \nsubprojects. For subprojects involving land acquisition, resettlement activities, and handling of \ngrievances  filed  by  the  public  including  project-affected  people  and  nongovernment \norganizations, and environmental impacts, NHA will provide the necessary expertise from the \nconstruction  supervision  consultant  team  or  from  NHA  staff  resources.  An \naccountant/administration  specialist  will  be  assigned  to  each  PIU.  Sufficient  administrative \nauthority will be delegated to the PIUs for effective and timely project implementation. The PIU \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendix 11. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n55.  The Investment Program will be implemented over 10 years, inclusive of procurement \nand preconstruction activities, and is expected to be completed by 30 June 2015. Under the \nnational highways improvement component, civil works will be bid out in three batches. The first \nbatch  of  subprojects  is  at  an  advanced  project  preparation  stage,  and  mobilization  of \nconstruction supervision consultants and civil works are expected to commence in March 2006 \nand  June  2006  respectively.  For  batch  2  and  3  subprojects,  NHA  will  develop  detailed \nimplementation plans at the time of the submission of the PFRs. The implementation schedule \nwill allow for acquisition of land free from encumbrances; resettlement; and clearance of all \nutilities, trees, and any other obstructions from the land to be used for construction. For the \npolicy reform component, implementation will be undertaken in two phases (para. 44). The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n56.  Procurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. To ensure a competitive bidding process, international competitive \nbidding contract packages will be encouraged. Civil works contracts will be procured through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  bidders.  Civil  works  contracts  with  an \nestimated value less than $5 million will be procured using local competitive bidding. Supply \ncontracts will use international shopping for contracts with an estimated value of $100,000\u2013\n$500,000,  and  direct  purchase  arrangements  for  contracts  of  less  than  $100,000.  The \nGovernment agreed to include the relevant sections of ADB's Anticorruption Policy18 in all \nbidding and contract documents. \n \n57.  Subproject  batches  1  and  2  involve  nine  international  competitive  bidding  contract \npackages for road improvement civil works. The contract packaging takes into account the need \nfor a balance between (i) minimizing administration by consolidating works in larger contracts, \nand  (ii)  designing  package  sizes  that  will  enable  international  contractors  to  participate. \nIndicative  contract  packages  are  in  Appendix  13.  Determination  of  the  remainder  of  the \nsubprojects and accompanying civil works packages will be done during project implementation. \nConsidering that the civil works are standard, and the works have been packaged to enable \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1998.

Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n58.  ADB  management  approved  (i)  advance  action  for  procurement  of  civil  works  and \nrecruitment of consultants, and (ii) the request to seek ADB Board approval for retroactive \nfinancing for the PFRs under the MFF\u2014up to 20% of the proceeds of the individual loans under \nthe MFF\u2014provided that expenditures are incurred in accordance with agreed procedures and \nduring the 12 months before the signing of the corresponding individual loan agreement and \nloan effectiveness under the MFF. Retroactive financing is sought for eligible expenditures \nincluding land acquisition and resettlement costs, business opportunities seminars, incremental \ncosts, consulting services, and civil works. The Government has been informed that approval of \nadvance procurement action and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to \nfinance the subprojects. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n59.  International  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  assist  NHA  in  implementing  the \nInvestment Program. The terms of reference for all loan-financed consulting services will be \nsubject to prior ADB approval. International consultants recruited as a consulting firm will be \nengaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers. For \ninternational consultants, recruitment will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants, and for domestic consultants, arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n  \n60.  For the batch 1 and 2 subprojects, three ADB-financed consulting services packages will \nprovide support for the bidding process and construction supervision of civil works for highway \nimprovement. The consultants will help with construction supervision of the nine civil works \npackages covering the eight subprojects located in different areas in the country. Consulting \nservices for batch 3 subprojects will be prepared during implementation of the Investment \nProgram. Detailed engineering design and feasibility studies for the batch 2 and 3 subprojects \nwill  be  undertaken  by  locally  recruited  consultants  and  financed  from  NHA  resources.  A \nsummary of consulting service packages for batch 1 and 2 subprojects is in Appendix 14 and \nthe outline terms of reference for consultants for construction supervision is in Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \n \n61.  In addition to the recruitment of consultants through firms, NHA will engage individual \nexperts as follows: (i) a locally based resettlement specialist to prepare resettlement plans for all \nsubprojects; undertake land acquisition and resettlement activities; and conduct training of NHA \nstaff for strengthening the capacity of overall planning and implementation of land acquisition \nand  resettlement  activities;  (ii)  an  international  social  monitoring  specialist  for  independent \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting  of  the  progress  of  activities  associated  with  land \nacquisition and resettlement; (iii) international environment expert to oversee environmental \ncompliance of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (November 2002) and safeguard measures for all \nsubprojects; and (iv) a contract specialist to assist NHA in the process associated with engaging \nconsultants  and  procuring  civil  works.  All  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  through \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. Terms of reference for the three consultants in (i)\u2013(iii) are \nshown in Supplementary Appendixes C, D, and E, respectively. \n \n                                                 \n19 However, requests for extension from bidders will be favorably considered up to 60 days and 90 days, respectively. \n \n ", "  19\n62.  For the institutional strengthening of NHA, international consulting services (financed \nfrom the Special Funds resources loan, para. 51) will be recruited to assist NHA in implementing \npolicy reforms as agreed with NHA. ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures and \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2002) will be used. The terms of reference \nare  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  In  addition,  individual  expertise  including  contract \nadministration  specialists  and  financial  advisers,  as  required  by  NHA,  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n63.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  NHA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Investment  Program. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the subprojects. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Investment Program will include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of NHA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n64.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(January  2001),  and  Disbursement  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-Based \nLoan Products (July 2002), as amended from time to time. Direct payment procedures will \ngenerally be used for large civil works contracts and consulting services. NHA will establish an \nimprest account for the Investment Program at the National Bank of Pakistan, with an initial \nadvance equivalent to the estimated eligible project expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% \nof the loan amount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be established, managed, and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nagreed to by the Government and ADB. Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to \nreimburse  eligible  expenditures,  or  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  account  for  any \nindividual payment under $100,000. \n \n8.  Accounts, Audit, and Reports \n \n  a.  Accounts and Audit \n \n65.  NHA  and  the  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  project  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify the goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, \nexpenditures incurred for the project, and use of local funds. These project accounts and related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an \nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB. NHA will submit annual audited reports and related \nfinancial statements to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditure will be carried out as part of the regular annual \naudit.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  the  examination  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditure should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "20   \nb.  Reports \n \n66.  NHA will prepare and submit to ADB monthly and quarterly progress reports on investment \nprogram implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with ADB. NHA will monitor \nproject preparation and implementation in accordance with the implementation schedule, and will \nkeep ADB informed of any significant deviations from the schedule. The quarterly report will \nsummarize  the  information  in  the  detailed  reports,  including  basic  data,  utilization  of  funds, \nachievement of immediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation \nprogress, land acquisition, resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. \n \n67.  Within 3 months of physical completion of the subprojects, NHA will provide ADB with a \nproject completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, contractors\u2019 \nand consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of return, and other \ndetails as may be requested by ADB. In addition, within 3 months of each loan closing date, a \nloan completion report is to be provided. At the end of the MFF period, a facility completion report \nis to be provided within 3 months. \n \n  9.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation   \n \n68.  NHA will establish a capability for systematic investment program performance monitoring \nand analysis throughout the life of the Investment Program, integrated with their management \ninformation  system.  Initially,  a  baseline  for  performance  monitoring  will  be  established  and \nthereafter, surveys will be conducted annually. The scope of the survey, quantity and quality of \ndata, and frequency for collection will be guided primarily by the project management\u2019s need for \nprogressive rapid feedback on implementation status, as well as early warning of impending \nsituations that might jeopardize attainment of the development objectives. The key indicators and \nassumptions outlined at the impact and outcome levels in the design framework (Appendix 1) will \nform the core of the data required for rapid assessment. \n \n10.  Investment Program Review \n \n69.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, the individual loan agreements extended \nduring the MFF period will include a requirement for a detailed midterm review for the respective \nthree subproject batches. Two months prior to the midterm review, the Government will submit to \nADB a detailed progress report on the progress of the Investment Program. Terms of reference \nfor the midterm review will be included in the MFF administration memorandum to be prepared by \nADB\u2019s inception mission for the Investment Program.  \n \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Analysis and Sustainability \n \n70.  Economic analysis was performed by evaluating subproject investments considering \ncapital and recurrent costs in addition to benefits derived from savings in road user costs and \npassenger time for the with- and without-project cases. The economic analysis was performed \nfor the initial 20 years of project operation. The main quantifiable benefits of the subprojects are \n(i) savings on vehicle operating costs and passenger time for existing and diverting traffic, and \n(ii) savings for traffic generated by improved accessibility and distance savings. In addition, \nsubregional benefits arise from improved connectivity and from upgrading the N50 to a through \nroute.  \n \n ", "  21\n \n71.  The  eight  subprojects  identified  for  batches  1  and  2  support  reconstruction, \nimprovement, and increasing the capacity of some 836 km of national highway. Of the eight \nsubprojects identified, batch 1 comprising three sample subprojects with combined length 376 \nkm has been evaluated. The three include (i) the southernmost 85 km section of N25 (Hub\u2013\nUthal), complementing ADB\u2019s ongoing project on the northernmost section of the route (Kalat\u2013\nQuetta\u2013Chaman); (ii) 255 km of the key east\u2013west N50 (Khanozai\u2013Zhob) currently unsuitable \nfor through traffic, necessitating a very long detour; and (iii) construction of a 2-lane dual \ncarriageway  for  36  km  of  N70  (Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh),  including  an  urgently  required \nMuzaffargarh bypass. The three sample subproject sections are part of important interprovincial \nroutes (i) Sindh\u2013Balochistan, (ii) NWFP\u2013Balochistan, and (iii) Punjab\u2013Balochistan, respectively. \nThey are also key subregional connectivity links (i) Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan and on to the Central \nAsian republics, (ii) Iran and Afghanistan to the People\u2019s Republic of China and India,; and (iii) \nIran and Afghanistan\u2013India. \n \n72.  The  economic  analysis  shows  that  the  three  subprojects  (batch  1)  are  viable,  with \neconomic internal rates of return of (i) N25\u201416.5%, (ii) N50\u201421.0%, and (iii) N70\u201437.8%. \nTheir direct benefits primarily comprise reduced vehicle operating costs and passenger time \nsavings. The three proposed bypasses (Muzaffargarh, Muslimbagh, and Zhob) will provide \nmuch  needed  relief  for  local  communities  heavily  impacted  by  through  traffic.  During \nconstruction, employment opportunities will be created for thousands of workers and in the case \nof N50 in areas where little alternative employment is available, providing a substantial stimulus \nto  local  communities.  The  sample  three  subprojects  will  facilitate  marketing  of  agricultural \nproduce and improve people\u2019s access to social services in poverty areas, while also contributing \nto  regional  trade  between  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan.  Fruit  and  vegetable  distribution  from \npoverty-affected areas will be facilitated by the three subprojects. In the medium to long term, \nthe  three  routes  are  expected  to  play  leading  roles  as  subregional  connectors  and  trade \nfacilitators, with widespread economic benefits for Pakistan, the subregion, and central Asia. \nAppendix 15 provides the economic analysis. \n \n73.  The financial sustainability of NHA and the NHDP was assessed by taking into account \nthe financial capacity of NHA based upon past Government contributions to its investment \nprogram  and  projected  Government  contributions.  NHA\u2019s  road  maintenance  program  is \nadequately covered by Government contributions and toll receipts from sections of the national \nhighway network. Overall, NHA is able to maintain financial sustainability of the Investment \nProgram. The financial management assessment reveals that NHA\u2019s overall system of financial \ninternal control is reasonably satisfactory. However, the status of completion of auditing of \nfinancial accounts is behind schedule. NHA has agreed with the World Bank and ADB to \nappoint external auditors to clear the backlog with clearance of 2003/04 financial accounts by 30 \nJanuary 2006. \n \nB.  Social Impacts \n \n  1.  Poverty Reduction and Socioeconomic Impacts  \n \n74.  The overall poverty levels in Balochistan and Punjab are reported at 39% and 30% \nrespectively, 44% and 34% in rural areas and 30% and 24% in urban areas respectively. \nPoverty impact ratios were calculated by distributing vehicle operating costs and time benefits to \nbeneficiary groups and estimating the share of the poor in each group, based on survey data. \nThe poverty impact ratios of the batch 1 subprojects (N25, N50, N70) are estimated at 13%, \n32%, and 33% respectively. \n \n \n ", "22   \n \n75.  The batch 1 subprojects will create significant employment opportunities for skilled and \nunskilled labor during their implementation. Unskilled labor will be employed directly in road \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and maintenance; and indirectly in providing materials and services \nfor contractors. The subprojects will generate approximately 26,000 person-months of unskilled \nlabor employment, generally at higher wage rates than otherwise obtainable in the local job \nmarket. The N50 subproject will generate employment in areas where no other job opportunities \nexist.  The subprojects\u2019  impact  on  poverty  will  be  enhanced  by  encouraging  contractors  to \nengage  local  workers  in  subproject  areas  and  to  provide  first  priority  to  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged during construction. Long distance traffic diverting to the N50 highway will bring \npassing  trade  and  tourism  to  some  of  the  most  disadvantaged  areas  of  the country.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16. Social analysis for the sample \nsubprojects revealed that the subprojects will contribute to better living standards for the poor, \ngenerate off-farm employment opportunities, reduce commuting times, and provide improved \naccess to services (Supplementary Appendix G). \n \n2.  Gender \n \n76.  The Investment Program will benefit women by providing them with easier access to \nmarkets, better delivery of services, and improved access to better quality health care facilities \nand higher education. The Investment Program will ensure (i) civil work contracts include legally \nmandated  provisions  for  health;  sanitation;  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including \naccommodation,  where  appropriate,  for  construction  workers  at  campsites  during  the \nconstruction period; and (ii) that civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor laws, \nincluding elimination of gender-differentiated wages. People (men and women) directly affected \nby the subprojects will be given priority for employment. Contractors must not vary the wages of \nmen and women employed for work of equal value. A specific clause will be included in bidding \ndocuments, and compliance will be strictly monitored during implementation. Potential risks of \nhuman  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDs)  and \nwomen/children trafficking threats may be aggravated by the increased connectivity of the \nproject areas. NHA will employ qualified domestic consultants under construction supervision to \naddress these issues through its mitigating measures. \n \n3.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Aspects \n \n77.  The subprojects are to be developed with a view to avoid or minimize the need for land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement. The construction of the project highways will largely \nfollow  the  alignment  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  Urban  congestion  points  are  being \nbypassed with new sections of road, for which land will have to be acquired. For the three batch \n1 subprojects and associated bypasses (N25, N50, and N70), a full census for resettlement \nplanning was conducted of all the affected people, land, and structures/assets on the right-of-\nway. In addition, a 20% socioeconomic sample survey was conducted. Batch 1 subprojects will \nrequire acquisition of approximately 105 hectares for the three national highways, and will likely \naffect about 606 households as a consequence of land acquisition. Widening and improvement \nwill affect 145 structures (100 shops or small business enterprises, 35 residential houses, and \n15  community  structures).  The  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  is  approximately  $16.40  million  equivalent.  A  summary \nresettlement plan is presented in Supplementary Appendix H. The entitlement matrix and an \nannouncement on the availability of the resettlement plan in local and regional offices was \npublished in the local newspaper on 30 June 2005; and copies of the resettlement plan were \nplaced at local/union council offices, teshil headquarters offices, government schools, Deputy \n \n ", "  23\nDistrict Officer Revenue\u2019s offices and NHA's regional offices at Multan and Quetta. NHA will \ndistribute the summary in local language and English to those affected. The summary will be \nplaced on the ADB website after loan approval. The complete plan will be publicly available at \nNHA, and at ADB's Pakistan Resident Mission. Batch 2, comprising five subprojects, and batch \n3 subprojects will be designed using the criteria for the batch 1 three sample subprojects. The \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement20  for  preparing  the  Investment \nProgram necessitated the preparation of a resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix I) \nfor all subprojects. A resettlement plan for batch 2 and 3 subprojects will be prepared and \napproved by NHA and submitted to ADB for approval. \n \n4.  Indigenous Peoples \n \n78.  The batch 1 subproject areas are each characterized by distinct population groups, \nlanguages,  social  organizations,  and  cultures  that  comprise  their  respective  mainstream \npopulations. These populations are all integrated into the cultural and economic mainstreams of \ntheir respective regional, provincial, and federal structures. No separate disadvantaged groups \nthat  differ  from  the  dominant  local  population  are  likely  to  be  adversely  affected  by  the \nInvestment  Program. Thus preparation of an indigenous people\u2019s development plan is not \nrequired. Nonetheless, the Investment Program will have a monitoring and evaluation system \nthat monitors adverse impacts on potentially vulnerable groups (households living below the \nrecognized poverty line; households headed by women, the elderly, the disabled) and initiate \nmeasures to mitigate such adverse impacts through resettlement plans. \n \n5.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n \n79.  According  to  the  World  Health  Organization  and  Joint  United  Nations  Program  on \nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Pakistan has a low prevalence but is a high-risk country for the spread of \nHIV infection. Considering the risk of possible presence of laborers not from the immediate \nproject  area  for  road construction works  and long-distance  truck  drivers,  NHA  will  employ \nqualified domestic consultants as part of the construction supervision contracts to conduct an \ninformation and education campaign on the risks of HIV/AIDS and women/children trafficking, \ntargeting construction workers at campsites, truck drivers at truck stops, and local communities \nalong project highways, particularly rural women. The consultants will work closely with the \nrelevant district agencies and other existing networks dedicated to the prevention of HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact and Measures \n \n80.  The overall Investment Program is classified as environment category \u201cA,\u201d however; the \nsubprojects vary as \u201cB\u201d and \u201cA\u201d type activities. The environmental impacts of the batch 1 \nsubprojects were assessed by undertaking an initial environmental impact assessment for (i) \nN25: Hub\u2013Uthal and N50: Kuchlak\u2013Zhob; and (ii) an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for \nN70: Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh. The first two subprojects involve the widening and improvement of \nthe existing road to 2-lane national standard road. The N70 subproject involves expanding the \nexisting road to 4-lane national standard and construction of an approximately 15 km bypass. \nThe studies found that the environmental impacts associated with these subprojects are mostly \nrelated  to  construction,  such  as  increased  dust,  noise,  volatile  gas  due  to  hot-mix  plants, \ndisruption of existing traffic movement, loss of roadside trees, and increased suspended solids \nin  the  water  bodies.  These  environmental  impacts  are  temporary  and  reversible,  and  the \nmitigation measures to minimize them are manageable. None of these subprojects will influence \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1. Manila. \n \n \n ", "24   \necologically sensitive areas or will impinge on cultural or archaeological sites. However, the \nconstruction of a new bypass as part of N70 will affect a number of private properties, and \ntherefore require land acquisition. \n \n81.  Although the environmental impacts associated with the three sample subprojects are \ninsignificant and manageable, implementation of the environmental management plan (EMP) \nneeds  to  be  monitored  continuously,  and  the  semiannual  report  on  EMP  implementation \nsubmitted to ADB and relevant Government agencies. NHA will be responsible for overall \nimplementation of the EMP and its updating, as well as for implementing the environmental \nmonitoring plan. The contractor will be responsible for implementing the required mitigation \nmeasures  during  construction.  Considering  the  wide  range  of  NHA\u2019s  responsibilities  in \naddressing environmental concerns related to the Investment Program, a consultant will be \nhired to assist NHA in (i) ensuring that all necessary mitigation measures are included in the \ncontract document for civil works, (ii) supervising and monitoring implementation of mitigation \nmeasures during construction, and (iii) implementing the EMP, environmental monitoring plan, \nand environmental assessment review procedure framework. The terms of reference for the \nconsultant are outlined in Supplementary Appendix E. The environmental impact assessment of \nbatch  2  and  3  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and  reviewed  by  adopting  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  attached  in  Supplementary  Appendix  J.  The  summary \nenvironmental impact assessment incorporating the impact assessment studies for the batch 1 \nsample subprojects was submitted to the Board and disclosed to the public through ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 30 June 2005.  The SEIA was circulated with title PAK: Proposed Subregional \nTransport Connectivity (Pakistan) Sector Project and through ADB\u2019s website, the change in title \nwas informed to the public on 31 October 2005. \n \nD.  Investment Program Risks  \n \n82.  To avoid the risk of the Investment Program not being sustainable due to inadequate \nmaintenance, for each of the subproject road improvements, the Government will be required to \nenter into long-term operation and maintenance contracts, to be awarded to private contractors \non the basis of competition. Implementation progress for the provincial road projects has been \nslower than anticipated. For Punjab,21 the provincial government, after much delay in ensuring \ncompliance of bid documents and evaluation procedures in accordance with ADB procedures \nand guidelines, has finally appointed the project management consultants. For the Balochistan \nRoad  Project  (footnote  16  above),  implementation  is  progressing  satisfactorily  after  the \nrecruitment of project management consultants. Prequalification of civil works contractors have \nbeen completed and bid evaluation is in progress; civil works contracts are expected to be \nawarded by the end of 2005. For the NWFP Road Project (footnote 5 above), subsequent to \ninitial  delays  in  gaining  approval  of  the  Government\u2019s  project  pro  forma  document,  the \nrecruitment of the project management consultant and preparation of bid documents are at an \nadvanced stage; civil works are expected to commence by mid-2006. \n \n83.  The risk of initial implementation delays as experienced in the NWFP project is being \naddressed by having NHA act as the executing agency for the Investment Program. NHA has \nsubstantial experience with implementing major national highways and motorway development \nprojects in all provinces, and has additional legal powers to support project land acquisition and \nresettlement.  For  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities,  delays  will  be  minimized  by \naugmenting  NHA\u2019s  capacity  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  by  providing  consulting \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab Road Development Sector Project. Manila (Loan 1928-PAK, for $150 \nmillion). \n \n ", "  25\nservices to support implementation of the resettlement plan. Due to the early appointment of the \nproject directors, advance work has commenced in preparation of land acquisition activities. The \nrisk of delays due to slow procurement activities is being addressed by (i) early ADB approval of \nbatch 1 subproject documents for recruitment of project supervision consultants and bidding \ndocuments  for  civil  works,  (ii)  early  commencement  of  advance  recruitment  and  advance \nprocurement  actions,  (iv)  a  business  opportunities  seminar  for  international  contractors  to \npartake  in  civil  works  construction  of  batch  1  and  2  subprojects,  (iv)  two  dedicated  ADB \nworkshops  for  NHA  staff  on  ADB  procurement  procedures,  (v)  preparation  for  the  early \nrecruitment of a procurement adviser, and (vi) establishment of the project management offices \nand appointment of the principal coordinating officer and the project directors for the batch 1 \nsubprojects.  In  addition,  NHA  has  obtained  internal  Central  Development  Working  Party \napproval of the project pro forma document, thereby ensuring early loan effectiveness. \n \n84.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  batch  1  sample  subprojects  suggests  no  significant \neconomic risks. Sensitivity tests and risk analysis show that the sample subprojects will be \neconomically viable even under a combination of adverse scenarios. The risk of adverse social \nand environmental impacts has been addressed through the mitigation measures included in \nthe resettlement plan, EIA, and EMP, and through associated conditions and assurances of the \nproject loans. For the Investment Program, the subprojects will be required to comply with the \neligibility criteria (Appendix 8) before becoming eligible for ADB financing. \n \n85.  Use of a new financing modality, over the 10-year implementation period, poses a risk \nfor both Pakistan and ADB. ADB program teams must be on standby to offer advice and guide \nNHA on specific issues and problems pertaining to operations under the MFF. The Government \nand NHA are providing ADB with a set of warranties and representations on these fronts and \nmay need real time support prior to making formal submission of PFRs under the MFF. ADB will \nhandle this requirement in two ways. Firstly, it will strengthen the human resources of its \nPakistan  Resident  Mission,  and  will  ensure  the  development  of  additional  capacity  in \nprocurement  and  safeguard  compliance  activities  in  the  resident  mission\u2019s  operations. \nSecondly, headquarters staff responsible for the Investment Program will utilize the processing \ntime savings to supervise and monitor the Investment Program. This is clearly one of the \nadvantages of the MFF. NHA has the capacity and willingness to adhere to the framework \nfacility  understandings,  but  from  time-to-time  the  parties  in  the  field  will  require  special \nassistance. ADB will position itself to give it. \n \n86.  The fiduciary risk under the Investment Program will be addressed mainly through the \narrangements  made  in  the  areas  of  procurement,  accounting,  and  reporting.  Financial \nmanagement,  better  budgeting,  management  and  information  system  improvement,  and \nstrengthened financial planning will form part of the capacity-building program. The longer term \nobjective, however, will be to leave in place systems, people, and procedures that can outlive \nthe Investment Program itself. The Government and NHA are especially keen on this approach \nand accordingly will work with ADB toward this endeavor. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n87.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n88.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval Process. In selecting subprojects to be \nundertaken within the Investment Program, the criteria set forth in Appendix 8 will be adhered \nto. \n \n \n ", "26   \n \n89.  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  NHA  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement proceed in accordance with applicable laws, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement  (footnote 20),  as  well  as  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  and \nresettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  plan  for  batch  1  sample  subprojects  is  set  forth  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  H,  and  the  resettlement  framework  for  batch  2  and  batch  3 \nsubprojects is set forth in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n90.  NHA will (i) prepare and implement resettlement plans, in accordance with ADB's policy \non involuntary resettlement (footnote 20) with the principles and procedures laid out in the \nresettlement framework and agreed between the Government and ADB prevailing (ii) disclose \nsubproject resettlement plans to affected people in a form and language easily comprehensible \nto APs prior to submission to ADB for review and approval before award of the related civil \nworks contracts or a similar milestone, (iii) monitor and submit the quarterly progress and \ncompletion reports on land acquisition and resettlement, (iv) appoint an independent monitoring \nexpert prior to commencement of land acquisition and resettlement activities, and ensure that \nreports are simultaneously submitted to NHA and ADB. \n \n91.  The resettlement budget will be revised based on any new data collected, and any \nadditional land acquisition and resettlement cost that may be required will be borne by the \nBorrower. If there is any change in the scope of the investment program subprojects, the \nresettlement plans will be revised and submitted for ADB approval prior to award of civil work \ncontracts. \n \n92.  NHA will ensure that (i) compensation for land and structures will be provided to affected \npersons in full at replacement value including financial assistance/grants, if any, prior to taking \npossession of their assets; and that essential public infrastructure affected by land acquisition \nand resettlement are replaced appropriately and expeditiously; (ii) acquire or make available on \na timely basis (i.e., strictly in accordance with the schedule as agreed under the related civil \nworks contract) the land and rights in land, free from any encumbrances; and (iii) clear the \nutilities, trees, and any other obstruction from such land, on a timely basis (i.e., strictly in \naccordance with the schedule as agreed under the related civil works contracts), as required for \nconstruction activities relating to each section of the related civil works contract under the \nInvestment Program. \n \n93.  Environment. NHA will implement mitigation measures and the EMP for the batch 1  \nthree  sample  subprojects  as  described  in  the  initial  environmental  examination,  EIA,  and \nsummary EIA reports in accordance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environment policies. \nNHA will implement the Environmental Assessment and Review Framework for the batch 2 and \nbatch 3 subprojects. \n \n94.  NHA will obtain all necessary national and provincial environmental statutory clearances \nsuch  as  environmental  clearance,  forest  clearance,  and  nonobjection  certificates  prior  to \ncommencing any civil work. NHA shall ensure that all conditions attached to these clearances \nwill  be  implemented  and  monitored.  NHA  will  develop  and  implement  EMP  and  submit \nsemiannual reports to ADB and relevant agencies on the implementation of the EMP, conditions \nof clearance for \u201cA\u201d category subprojects, and annual reports for \u201cB\u201d category subprojects as \npart of the progress report on investment program implementation. \n \n95.  NHA will report to ADB any change of road alignment or \u201cas change\u201d in a project \ncomponent that occurs after the EIA report was approved by ADB. ADB\u2019s prior approval will be \n \n ", "  27\nrequired before putting into effect any such changes, where in the opinion of ADB, additional \nenvironmental  assessment  will  be  made.  NHA  will  prepare  a  semiannual  report  on \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  as  part  of  the  progress  reports  on  investment  program \nimplementation. NHA will provide the contractors with the environmental assessment study \nreports including the EMP, and ensure that the contractors implement the mitigation measures \nand EMP as described in these reports. NHA will update the EMP for Muzaffargarh bypass as \npart of the detail engineering work and submit it to ADB for review prior to commencing civil \nworks. \n \n96.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking. NHA will ensure that civil works contracts under all \nthe  subprojects  incorporate  provisions  requiring  contractors  to  (i)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  and \nwomen/children trafficking awareness and prevention programs for laborers; (ii) not employ or \nuse children as laborers; and (iii) follow and implement legally mandated provisions on labor \n(including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, sanitation, and working conditions. NHA will \nengage qualified locally based consultants under construction supervision contracts to carry out \nthe HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking component as agreed with ADB. The PIUs will \nsupervise the consultants and work closely with Pakistan\u2019s National AIDS Control Program and \nother  networks  dedicated  to  preventing  sexually  transmitted  infections,  HIV/AIDS,  and \nwomen/children trafficking; and to the empowerment of women and children. \n \n97.  Road Maintenance. NHA will develop in consultation with ADB and have its executive \nboard approve a road maintenance plan for the fiscal years 2007/11 by 31 March 2007, which \nwill, among other things, provide funding modalities to finance the maintenance of relevant \nroads acceptable to ADB. \n \n98.  Policy Development and Investment Plan. The Government will ensure that by 30 \nJune 2007 or as agreed with ADB, an NTP, as endorsed by ADB, will have been promulgated. \n \n99.  By 30 June 2007, NHA will have established a fully functional road safety cell within it \nwith a mandate, among other things, (i) to analyze road safety risks and their consequences, (ii) \ndevelop recommendations for reduction of risks in existing and to be constructed roads, and (iii) \ndevelop a program for raising the awareness of the risk factors. The phrase \u201cfully functional\u201d in \nthe preceding sentence will mean that all core staff for the road safety cell will have been \nappointed and activities launched. The road safety cell will also have the capacity to undertake \nsafety audits of road designs as well as prepare work zone safety plans.  \n \n100.  NHA will establish a policy formulation and coordination office as soon as possible but \nno later then 90 days after the date of loan effectiveness to provide guidance and monitor the \noverall implementation of the agreed policy reforms. \n \n101.  The Government will ensure that by 30 June 2007, an updated NHA Investment Plan for \nfiscal years 2007/11, to be prepared in consultation with ADB is approved. \n \n102.  Investment Program Management. The Government, in order to ensure continuity, \ntransparency, efficiency, and good management, will cause NHA to consult with ADB on all \nsignificant matters relating to management and implementation of the Investment Program. All \nmatters relating to selection or appointment, or any changes to such selection or appointment, \nof any project director or deputy project director, will be duly notified to ADB along with the \nqualifications of the incumbents and the departing officers and reasons for such changes. The \nappointment of a project director or deputy project director cannot be terminated or terms of \nsuch appointment altered in any material way until the third anniversary of such appointment \n \n \n ", "28   \nunless a determination of gross dereliction of duty or such other serious misconduct is made \nthrough due process. \n \n103.  To provide an open channel for registering grievances of any type regarding NHA\u2019s \nmanagement of the Investment Program, a dedicated website will be established. Such a \ndedicated website will be established to be available in English and Urdu, and provide an easy \nmethod  for  seeking  redress  of  grievances.  The  website  will  be  hosted  by  the  Vigilance \nCommittee. The Vigilance Committee will keep an accurate record of all grievances files and \nresponses and other actions taken. The establishment of the website shall be widely publicized \nthrough all English and Urdu media. Each office of NHA and all offices of the NHA contractors \nwill prominently display information on the website and ways to use it. The Vigilance Committee \nwill report to the NHA Executive Board and to ADB every quarter on progress toward resolution \nof grievances filed through the website and any other means. The website will be maintained \nproperly and in the event of any failure to keep it functional for more than 7 consecutive days, \nADB will be promptly informed. \n \n104.  Capacity Development. The Government will cause NHA to accelerate recruitment of \nprofessional staff and reduce unfilled vacancies of approved posts as they stand on the date of \nloan effectiveness to no more than 10% of such approved posts for each department within 2 \nmonths of the loan effectiveness date, unless otherwise agreed with ADB, all posts of grade 16 \nand above will be considered professional posts for the purpose of this provision. \n \n105.  The  Government  will  cause  NHA  to  design,  develop,  and  adopt  a  comprehensive \ntraining program, including management training, for enhancement of skills of all newly recruited \nand other staff so that they meet at least the minimum levels of competencies required for their \npositions.  The  Human  Resources  Department  of  NHA  will  be  entrusted  to  undertake  the \nrequisite training needs analysis and based on such analysis a two-year- training calendar will \nbe prepared by 30 June 2006 or as agreed with ADB, by the department showing the scope, \nlength, and location of each training to be offered. An annual external evaluation of the training \nprogram will be carried out within 45 days of the training program of the calendar year. \n \n106.  Institutional Reform and Development. The Government will cause NHA to complete \nan institution reform program in consultation with ADB and begin execution of such plan by 30 \nJune 2007. ADB will be periodically consulted on progress and direction of all reforms initiated \nunder the aegis of this program. \n \n107.  The Government will cause NHA to prepare and install in consultation with ADB a \nfinancial management system. Such financial management system will include key performance \nindicators and monitoring and reporting mechanisms. Within 9 months of the implementation of \nsuch financial management system, an external evaluation of its robustness will be carried out. \nThe report and recommendations of the external evaluation will be shared with ADB and the \nagreed recommendations will be duly adopted as promptly as possible. \n \n108.  Labor Laws. The Government will cause NHA to ensure that the civil works contractors \ncomply with all applicable labor laws and regulations and do not employ child labor in the \nconstruction activities. The Government will cause NHA to encourage civil works contractors to \nhire women and minorities, including Gypsies wherever possible. The Government will ensure \nthat NHA provides equal opportunity for women for road construction activities, as well as \nrequires contractors to not differentiate wages between men and women for work of equal \nvalue. The Government, through NHA, will ensure that a specific clause to this effect is included \nin all relevant bidding documents, and compliance is strictly monitored and documented during \n \n ", "  29\nInvestment Program implementation. Recognizing the challenges in recruitment of women for \nsuch employment, a reputable private organization will be appointed to independently monitor, \ndevelop suggestions and guidelines for improvement of performance in each of these areas and \non a quarterly basis, and report on all such matters to ADB through NHA. \n \n109.  Midterm Reviews. A comprehensive midterm review, the timing to be determined in \nagreement with ADB and NHA for each batch of subprojects, will be undertaken jointly by ADB \nand NHA to review all aspects of project implementation, including procurement financing and \nscheduling matters. \n \n110.  Performance Audit. The Government will cause an annual performance audit for each \nof  the  subprojects  of  the  Investment  Program  to  be  completed  pursuant  to  the  terms  of \nreference to be developed by ADB. All costs incurred in connection with such performance \naudits will be paid out of the Investment Program funds. \n \n111.  Condition for Effectiveness. As an additional condition for effectiveness for the loan \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, the first ordinary operations loan under MFF will have \nbecome effective. \n \nVI.

Road Network and Administration \n \n1.  Transport contributes about 10% of gross domestic product (GDP). Road transport is the \ndominant  mode,  accounting  for  91%  of  passenger  traffic  and  96%  of  freight  traffic.  Road \ntransport services are largely in the private sector, which handles some 95% of freight traffic, \nand is subject to strong competition. During the 1990s, the overall demand for road transport \ngrew at 7\u20138% per year, compared with average gross domestic product growth of 4\u20135%. The \nnumber of registered motor vehicles in 2004 was 2.94 million (20 per 1,000 population), with a \nfurther 3.01 million motorcycles and rickshaws. The combined fleet is growing at 9% annually. \nThe total length of the road network is some 250,000 kilometers (km), 60% of it paved. The \nnational  highway  network  comprises  about  8,320  km  of  national  highway  and  710  km  of \nmotorways, and carries 75\u201380% of commercial traffic. The main domestic artery is concentrated \nalong  the  1,670  km  Karachi\u2013Lahore\u2013Peshawar  corridor.  This  serves  80%  of  the  urban \npopulation and carries over 55% of intercity traffic. A detailed condition survey carried out in \n2001 indicates that 50% of the national highway network was in poor to very poor condition. \nSome deteriorated sections are located on important interprovincial and subregional routes \n(N25, N50, and N70), connecting Pakistan with Afghanistan and providing access to southern \nports. \n \n2.  The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications  is \nresponsible for the operation, maintenance, and development of the national highway system. It \nis an autonomous highway agency with a functional structure and decentralized implementation \nthrough regional provincial offices. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank \nhave provided assistance1 to reorganize and commercialize NHA, shifting its focus to a network \noperator and service provider role and strengthening financial management systems to improve \ngovernance.  However,  NHA  has  internal  capacity  constraints,  such  as  limited  in-house \ncapability in strategic planning, project and asset management, and network operation. NHA, \nunder the World Bank-financed National Highway Improvement Project, is incorporating on an \ninstitutional  basis  the  use  of  modern  road  asset  management  and  maintenance  systems \n(including  HDM-4)  for  operation  and  maintenance  and  integrating  them  in  day-to-day \noperations. \n \n3.  In  the  past  NHA  suffered  from  poorly  justified  investments,  began  too  many  new \nprojects, and did not pay sufficient attention to network conservation. The situation led to the \ndeterioration of road conditions along some of the more heavily trafficked highway sections, \ncaused project delays, increased project costs, and reduced the headroom for new high-priority \ninitiatives as well as conservation of the network. Encouraged by ADB and the World Bank, \nNHA has reprioritized and reprogrammed the investment program with more attention and \nresources for conserving the national highway network. Thus, the federal Government and NHA \nhave  initiated  a  five-year  PRs138  billion  National  Highway  Development  Plan  covering \nrehabilitation, resurfacing, and improvement of some 9,000 km of the national highway network, \nbased on a condition survey and a network-level prioritization study. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

National Highway Revenues and Expenditures \n \n4.  The NHA Act of 1991 permits NHA to receive funds from various sources including loans \nand  grants  from  the  federal  Government;  income  from  tolls;  foreign  aid;  grants  and  other \nreceipts (lease money, fees, rentals, fines, etc.); as well as funds from floating bonds, shares, \netc. At present, the bulk of NHA\u2019s receipts come as budgetary allocations from the federal \ngovernment. These are received as (i) cash development loans from the Ministry of Finance for \nthe Public Sector Development Program to fund capital development, (ii) annual maintenance \ngrants from the Ministry of Communications to fund operation and maintenance expenditures, \nand  (iii)  annual  establishment  grants  from  the  Ministry  of  Communications  to  cover  NHA \nestablishment costs (Table A2.1). \n \nTable A2.1: Summary of NHA Annual Allocations and Expenditures by Category \n(PRs million) \nFiscal Year  2003/04 2004/05 2005/06a \nTotal Expenditures  19,254 18,059 21,244 \nConstruction (PSDP)  17,347 14,382 15,963 \nMaintenance  825 900 1,200 \nEstablishment Charges  32 39 44 \nForeign Loans Repayment  1,050 2,738 4,037 \n   \nMaintenance as % of Total  4.2 4.9 5.6 \nExpenditures \nNHA = National Highway Authority, PSDP = public sector development project. \na Budget estimates. \nSource: National Highway Authority.   \n \n5.  Recently, NHA has increased its direct revenue as a result of the introduced fee-for-\nservice concept. This has been achieved by expanding its toll network, revising toll rates, and \npromoting  commercial  use  of  its  rights-of-way.  Net  revenues  from  toll  collections  and \ncommercial use of right-of-way are credited to a dedicated road maintenance account, plus the \nannual  Government  maintenance  grant.  NHA  is  committed  to  periodically  reviewing  and \nmodifying the structure and level of its road user charges to reflect the (i) extent of road use, (ii) \ndamage caused to the road network by individual vehicle categories, and (iii) level of service \nprovided. A summary of NHA direct receipts is shown in Table A2.2. \n \nTable A2.2: Summary of NHA Receipts \n(PRs million) \nFiscal Year  2003/04 2004/05 \nGross Toll Revenue  3,358 3,679 \nCollection and Operation Charges  993 1,086 \nNet Toll Revenue  2,365 2,593 \nOther Receipts  790 868 \nTotal Deployable Revenue  3,155 3,461 \nNHA = National Highway Authority. \nSource: National Highway Authority. \n \n6.  The financial management assessment undertaken revealed that NHA\u2019s overall system \nof financial internal control is reasonably satisfactory. However, the status of completion of \nauditing of financial accounts is behind schedule. NHA has agreed with the World Bank and \n ", "Appendix 2  35\nADB  to  appoint  external  auditors  to  clear  the  backlog  with  clearance  of  2003/04  financial \naccounts by 30 January 2006. \n \nC.  Subregional Connectivity \n \n7.  Pakistan\u2019s location makes it ideally placed to act as a hub for subregional transport and \nto take advantage of the subregion\u2019s rapidly improving political situation for the development of \ntransit and cross-border trade and commerce. Pakistan\u2019s road corridors offer the shortest route \nto the sea by several hundred km for landlocked Afghanistan, Central Asia, Xinjiang province of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, and for parts of the Russian Federation. Moreover, Pakistan \nhas traditionally been the bridge between east and west Asia; the recent improvement of \nrelations with India and the opening of new transport links open up the eventual possibility of \nIran/Afghanistan\u2013India  links  through  Pakistan,  in  addition  to  a  wealth  of  cross-border \nopportunities. However, physical, institutional, and other constraints currently prevent Pakistan \nfrom taking full advantage of its location. The potential for increased trade through improved \ntrade facilitation, rehabilitated transport links, efficient cross-border movements, and increased \nefficiency at ports is highly significant for the economy. Pakistan has an opportunity to play a \ncatalytic role in the development of such transport initiatives, thereby enhancing subregional \ncooperation in addition to promoting its domestic development. \n \n8.  A period of substantial progress in subregional cooperation expected. For example in \n2005 alone (i) Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to increase the number of border crossing \npoints and to begin operating a number of cross-border bus services; (ii) Pakistan and India \nhave agreed to the operation of bus services in Kashmir and to reopening cross-border rail \nlinks; and (iii) the People\u2019s Republic of China has agreed to support the further deepening of \nGwadar port. All the countries in the subregion have expressed a political commitment to \nimproved trading links. Rapidly expanding national economies will provide further impetus to this \nprocess. \n9.  Clearly, deepening subregional cooperation is a continuous process involving many \nstakeholders and not all the interests concerned necessarily support the process. Nevertheless, \nimproving  transport  links  and  facilitating  border  crossing  is  an  essential  prerequisite  and \nprovides a catalyst for improving other aspects. With the evident political goodwill in place and \ngrowing  pressure  from  consumers  in  the  subregion  for  improved  access  to  international \nmarkets, the stage is set for a transformation in the trading pattern, with particularly beneficial \nprospects for Pakistan. \n \nD.  Road Sector Issues \n \n10.  Definition  of  National  Highway  Network.  The  national  highway  network  currently \nexcludes many routes whose primary purpose is interprovincial. NHA and the provinces have \nproposed  routes  for  conversion  to  national  highways  (federalizing),  but  the  process  is \nconstrained by administrative and budget issues. A redefinition of the network is required, \nidentifying key national corridors and accelerating federalization to optimize road investment.  \n \n11.  Road Infrastructure and Maintenance. Based on assessments of road conditions, \nabout  half  of  the  national  highway  network  and  a  large  proportion  of  the  provincial  road \nnetworks are in poor condition. Deterioration levels on provincial roads are relatively severe \ncompared  with  those  on  national  highways.  The  Government  has  initiated  a  program  for \nrehabilitating priority highway sections with assistance from the World Bank and ADB in addition \nto Government resources. For the provincial highways and district roads, ADB is financing \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nsequenced interventions in each province to rehabilitate and improve road networks. To ensure \nsustainability, these projects also support policy and institutional reforms and capacity building \nfor the road agencies. NHA receives Government resources that are supplemented by toll \nrevenues. NHA\u2019s road maintenance fund, established in 2000, is financed by Government \ngrants and through increasing toll revenues as the tolling operations are expanded throughout \nthe national highway network. Annual revenues collected in 2004/2005 were about PRs3.6 \nbillion.  \n \n12.  NHA  recognizes  that  increasingly  greater  emphasis  and  more  spending  on  road \nmaintenance will be necessary to preserve the national road infrastructure asset base. NHA has \nincreased its spending on routine and periodic road maintenance; government grants for routine \nmaintenance increased from PRs825 million in FY2003/04 to PRs900 million in FY2004/05, but \nfurther increases are necessary to reduce the backlog of maintenance. Latest estimates place \nthe annual maintenance requirement to be approximately PRs6.3 billion. In addition to the \nannual government maintenance grants, NHA receives toll receipts and other sundry revenue \nfrom ROW activities which substantially covers the major maintenance programs. Maintenance \nis increasingly being contracted out to private civil works contractors. The ongoing expansion of \nthe road network, growth in traffic volume, and increase of the road asset base indicate that \nincreases in budget allocations for maintenance will be required. \n \n13.  Vehicle Overloading. Vehicle overloading is a major cause of premature pavement \ndeterioration  and  an  impediment  to  the  sustainable  development  of  the  highway  network. \nOverloading reduces the economic benefits of road projects and increases maintenance costs. \nA study by the National Transport Research Center2 has shown that some 43% of vehicles \nexceed the legal 12-ton axle-load limit mandated by the Road Safety Act 2000. Two-axle trucks \ncontribute  most  to  overloading,  which  is  increasing  at  about  2.6%  annually.  Although  the \nproportion of two-axle trucks in the fleet is declining, they still account for over 50% of truck \ntraffic. To prevent pavement damage, overloaded vehicles need to be monitored and axle-load \ncontrol enforced by weigh stations using static and weigh-in-motion measuring devices. NHA is \nimplementing a nationwide axle-load program with 30 weighbridges on national highways. The \nenforcement of rules needs to be strengthened. \n \n14.  Road Safety. Road traffic accidents result in over 10,000 fatalities per year (over 30 per \n10,000 vehicles) and 150,000 injuries, high levels compared with Southeast Asia, although \nbetter than in Bangladesh and India.3 Road improvements increase the risk of severe accidents \ndue to speeding. Without road safety initiatives, accidents will increase. Economic losses are \nestimated at over 2% of gross domestic product, although no centralized data collection and \nanalysis  of  provincial  traffic  accidents  and  deaths  is  available.  Accidents  result  from  high \nspeeds, lack of road safety measures, poor discipline and enforcement of rules, and poor \ncondition of vehicles. Road safety audits are not conducted routinely for new and improved \nroads. The road safety problem is exacerbated by lack of awareness and poor knowledge of \nroad safety matters among the general public and road users. National and provincial efforts \nand  coordination  are  not  concerted,  and  responsibilities  and  accountability  among  the \ninstitutions and provincial departments are unclear. Extensive efforts in education and training of \ndrivers, coupled with awareness building, are required to address the high fatality rate.

Manila. \n ", "Appendix 2  37\nfor establishing the National Highway and Motorway Police (NHMP) under the federal Ministry \nof Communications. This measure expands the role of the very successful motorway police to \nthe national highway system, in a phased manner.   \n \n15.  To  date,  road  safety  initiatives  have  been  confined  to  the  motorways  and  national \nhighways.  Preliminary  information  from  initiatives  taken  by  NHMP  shows  that  enforcement \ncoupled with engineering improvements and vehicle monitoring has significantly reduced traffic \naccidents and deaths. NHMP has successfully installed systems to improve road safety along \nthe motorways (412 km) and national highway N5 (1,760 km) in phases. NHMP services along \nthe  motorways  include  ambulances  with  paramedics,  mobile  workshops  with  mechanics, \nemergency telephones along the road, and briefing to commuters at entry points of motorways. \nThey use modern traffic enforcement and emergency relief equipment such as laser guns, video \nradar, video cameras, rescue vans, and emergency signboards. Through effective training and \nproactive organizational reforms, NHMP has been able to achieve a highly motivated and \ndedicated team of officers at each patrol post, commanded by a chief patrol officer. The officers \nregister violations without actually disturbing traffic as the documents and fines are not collected \nat the site. The successful performance of NHMP has been recognized and the plan is to \nexpand its operations to cover the entire national highway network. \n \n16.  Private Sector Participation. A large investment in road infrastructure is needed to \nsupport  accelerating  economic  growth,  which  is  necessary  to  reduce  poverty  and \nunemployment. The existing resource base is inadequate to meet the road development needs, \nand private sector investment will be necessary to fill the resource gap. Although several \ninitiatives, mostly at the national level, have been taken to attract private sector investments in \nthe road sector, few were successful primarily because of lack of (i) an enunciated policy on \nprivate  sector  participation,  (ii)  appropriate  institutional  structures  and  processes,  (iii) \nestablished  systems  and  procedures,  and  (iv)  capable  staff.  The  capacity  to  promote \ninfrastructure projects is limited. In addition, lack of financial expertise leads to difficulties in \npackaging  projects  that  could  be  successfully  offered  for  private  sector  financing.  ADB  is \nproviding technical assistance for preparing a public-private infrastructure financing facility4 to \nhelp design appropriate mechanisms for accelerating infrastructure development by increasing \nprivate  sector  participation.  Private  investors  have  approached  provincial  authorities  about \ninvesting in road development, but lack of policies and an enabling environment are major \nimpediments. As part of policy reform and the institutional strengthening component, assistance \nneeds to be provided to overcome barriers to private sector participation in road development. \n \n17.  The role of the private sector in road contracting and providing engineering services is \nfairly well developed. This could be increased by contracting out maintenance and gradually \nintroducing network management and performance-based contracts for maintenance. NHA is \npursuing opportunities for private sector participation in road infrastructure projects. Projects \ninclude the Lahore and Karachi bypasses, which are being prepared on a build-operate-transfer \nbasis. NHA needs, however, to step up its efforts to increase private sector participation. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004.

Methodology \n \n1.  The batch 1 subprojects to be financed under the National Highway Development \nSector Investment Program have been analyzed. The subprojects will reconstruct, improve, \nand increase the capacity of 340 kilometers (km) of national highway in Balochistan (N25 and \nN50) and of 36 km of national highway in Punjab (N70). The economic analysis examined the \nexpected contribution of the sample subprojects to the provinces and country and to improving \nsubregional connectivity. \n \n2.  The sample subprojects comprise existing paved roads in various states of repair. For \nthe without-project case, the quality of service will gradually deteriorate. For the with-project \ncase, routine and periodic maintenance is provided to maintain an international roughness \nindex of 2.0\u20135.0 over the cycle from construction to overlay. \n \nB.  Road Condition and Traffic \n \n3.  Road Condition. A National Highway Authority (NHA) survey assessed the existing \ncondition of the road sections in late-2004. The results are summarized in Table A15.1 \n \nTable A15.1: Road Condition Data \n \nRoad Section   Roughness Index (m/km) \nN25 Hub\u2013Uthal (84.5 km)  6.7 \nN50 Khanozai\u2013Zhob (255 km)    6.5 \nN70 Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh (36.2 km)   4.5 \nkm = kilometer, m = meter.  \nSource: Zeeruk Engineering Associates. \n \n4.  Traffic Volume. Traffic surveys were carried out over 4 days on N70 and for 1 day at \nvarious locations on N25 and N50. Survey results were converted to average annual daily \ntraffic applying daily and seasonal adjustment factors. Surveyed volume on N70 was adjusted \nto remove traffic temporarily diverting to the route due to construction work on the N5.

Road Construction and Maintenance Costs. Project implementation costs were \ndeveloped by the design consultants, applying 2005 unit rates for labor and materials. An \nimplementation period of 2\u20133 years was assumed, varying by subproject. Maintenance costs \nwere based on current NHA data, as given in Table A15.6. \n ", "Appendix 15             53\nTable A15.6: Maintenance Costs  \n(PRs/square meter) \n \nOperation  Financial  Economic \nEdge Repair  200.0 170.0 \nPatching  179.0 152.0 \nCrack Sealing   12.0 10.0 \nOverlay 50 millimeter  360.0 306.0 \nSource: Zeeruk Engineering Associates. \n \n8.  Financial costs, including taxes and duties, have been converted into economic costs \nusing an average conversion factor of 0.87, with the exception of unskilled labor for which a \nshadow wage rate factor of 0.7 has been applied, as used in similar studies in Pakistan. \n \nD.  Benefits \n \n9.  The main quantifiable benefits of the subproject investments are (i) vehicle operating \ncost savings for existing traffic, and (ii) time savings for existing passengers; and for N50 (i) \nbenefits to generated traffic and (ii) benefits to diverted traffic. The benefits to generated traffic \nare assumed to be half those for normal traffic. The value of time was taken as 25% of the \naverage  hourly  wage  rate.  Vehicle  operating  cost  benefits  are  conditional  on  adequate \nmaintenance of the project roads over the study period. NHA developed a computerized \nmaintenance database of the national highway network in 2005, based on condition surveys. \nA large increase in maintenance expenditure is planned and future maintenance will be \nprogrammed to achieve specific roughness targets. Time savings based on differences in \noperating speeds between the with- and without-project cases are escalated over the analysis \nperiod by the forecast increase in real per capita income. Generated and diverted traffic is \nparticularly significant for N50, which with the project will become the through route for \nBalochistan\u2013Punjab/North-West Frontier Province traffic, avoiding a lengthy detour. The large \ndistance savings achieved will also benefit subregional traffic from Afghanistan and Iran to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and India.  \n \nE.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     national priority in country poverty   \n      No  partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \nBased on an analysis of the determinants of poverty, Pakistan\u2019s poverty reduction strategy explicitly \nrecognizes that while economic growth and service delivery are crucial for poverty reduction, infrastructure \ndevelopment (aviation ports, railways, and roads) is critical as a catalyst for generating economic activity, \nemployment, and accelerating growth; and for providing better integration of Pakistan\u2019s various provinces \nand regions. Increased trade with neighboring countries, facilitated among other means through highways, \ncontributes to macroeconomic stability and reduced risks of shocks for the vulnerable poor.   \n \nThrough consultations with local communities during poverty reduction strategy formulation, improved \nconnectivity and access to markets through the provision of rural roads emerged as a key area and major \npriority for the poor; the provision of electricity was another. Rural urban linkages promoted through \nimprovements in highways and roads contribute to supporting greater stability of income and increased \nnonfarm employment in rural areas where the majority of Pakistan\u2019s population and the poor reside. In \nsupport of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, ADB recognizes the potential of Pakistan\u2019s \ncomplementarity  in  resources  and  markets  to  its  neighbors,  and  the  potential  to  be  gained  from \nsubregional  cooperation  through  development  of  transportation  links.  Transportation  is  expected  to \ncontribute to macroeconomic growth and increase revenue to the national exchequer and indirectly lead to \nan increase in social spending that benefits the poor, who have a disproportionate interest in public social \nspending. In addition, improved accessibility helps reduce the urban rural gap and leads to increased \neconomic activity generating off-farm employment for the poor. Yet macroeconomic growth in Pakistan \ndoes not necessarily translate into reducing the social gap.1 \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification : General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe number of poor2 in Pakistan has more than doubled in the 1990s, increasing to 45 million in 1999, of \nwhich 33 million or 73% (4.7 million households) are estimated to live in rural areas. Moreover, Pakistan \nranks poorly in major social indicators: infant mortality in rural areas  is  106  per  1,000  live births; \nmalnutrition of children under 5 is 39%. An important feature of poverty in Pakistan is the clustering of \nincomes around the poverty line, as 40.5% of the nation\u2019s population falls in a narrow income range \naround this line. Approximately 12.2% of the total population may be classed as chronically or extremely \npoor. According to Social Policy Development Center assessment in the 1990s over a 10-year period the \ndisposable income of the top income quintile grew in real terms by 23%, while that of the lowest quintile \ngrew by 3%, increasing the gap between the rich and the poor.3 Factors that affect the livelihood of the \npoor include (i) low literacy; (ii) lack of access to appropriate technologies, government extension services, \noff-farm employment opportunities, and formal credit; (iii) social exclusion; (iv) gender discrimination; (v) \nexclusion from benefit of development projects; and (vi) poor service delivery.  \n \nParticipatory rural appraisals (average 200 households in each sample subproject areas) conducted \nduring social assessment surveys of the three sample subproject areas revealed that 50% of people in the \ncatchments around the Hub\u2013Uthal section of N25 live below the poverty line, as do 20% living around the \nMultan\u2013Muzzafargarh sections of N70 and 30% of those in the communities around the Kuchlak\u2013Zhob \nsection  of  N50.  During  the  participatory  rural  appraisal,  the  majority  of  the  primary  stakeholders \nacknowledged the positive impacts of the various elements of the project especially (i) the benefits due to \nbetter accessibility of social services and market places; and (ii) improved local employment prospects \nduring project construction. The sample subprojects will create significant employment opportunities for \nskilled and  unskilled labor  during implementation.  Unskilled labor  will be  employed directly in road \nconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance,  and  indirectly  in  providing  materials  and  services  for \ncontractors. The sample subprojects will generate approximately 26,000 person-months of unskilled labor \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2002. Pakistan - Poverty Assessment. Washington DC. \n2  The official poverty line is estimated at 2,350 calories/day/adult, equivalent to Rs750 per month in 2002-PRSP.  \nThis was calculated at prices of 2000\u20132001.  Estimated inflationary changes at prices of 2004 raise it to Rs850 \nper adult equivalent per month (Economic Survey of Pakistan 2004).  \n3  Social Policy Development Center Annual Report 2001. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 16  55\nemployment, generally at higher wage rates than otherwise obtainable in the local job market. The N50 \nsubproject will generate employment in areas where no other job opportunities exist. The subprojects\u2019 \nimpact on poverty will be enhanced by encouraging contractors to engage local workers in subproject \nareas and to provide first priority to the poor and disadvantaged during construction. Long distance traffic \ndiverting to the N50 will bring passing trade and tourism to some of the most disadvantaged areas of the \ncountry. The poverty impact ratios of the sample subprojects (N25, N50, N70) are estimated at 13, 32, and \n33% respectively. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes   No \n \nParticipation, consultation, and information  dissemination  were incorporated at several levels during \nplanning  of  the  three  sample  subprojects  while  (i)  conducting  poverty  and  social  assessments  in \ncommunities of proposed road catchments and in the immediate corridor of impact; (ii) validating principles \non which entitlements for compensation and compensation levels specified in the entitlement matrix for the \nproject  are  based;  (iii)  forming  committees  of  people  affected  during  the  census  surveys;  and  (iv) \nminimizing adverse impacts, exploring alternate alignments, and restricting design to adjust to available \nspace. \nThe National Highway Authority (NHA) will ensure that essential participation focuses will be adhered to \nduring implementation that will involve local groups in (i) preparing final  compensation listings and \nindividual claim files and in the payment of compensation for acquired land and loss of assets and \nlivelihood; (ii) consultation with displaced APs and host communities on relocation options, if relocation is \nnecessary; (iii) AP\u2019s and Citizens Liaison Committees (ACLC) that will also include representatives from \nNHA and serve as liaison with the Project for compensation matters, technical design and construction \nissues and participate in any grievance redress; and (iv) the M&E process during implementation of the \nResettlement Plan.  \n  \nD.  Gender And Development \nWomen will be able to benefit from the Project through improved access to basic services such as health, \neducation and clean water. Additional assistance to female headed households will be provided as part of \nthe  resettlement  plan.  There are  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDs  and  women/children  trafficking  threats \nthat may be aggravated by the increased connectivity of the project areas, however the project aims to \naddress these issues through its' mitigating measures. \nHas an output been prepared?
