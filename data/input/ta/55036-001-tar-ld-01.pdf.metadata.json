The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help improve the policies and \nstrengthen capacity  of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) on promoting innovative finance for \necosystem protection and restoration (EPR) investment.2 In 2020, the Government of PRC \nadopted a 15-year master plan on EPR that promotes innovative and diversified investment and \nfacilitates the emergence of long-term multi-stakeholder funding mechanisms for EPR projects.3 \nAligning with PRC\u2019s objective to peak carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions before 2030 and achieve \n2\ncarbon neutrality by 2060, a study on innovating financing options for EPR projects will be \nconducted that will improve ecological environment and enhance the capacity of nature-based \ncarbon sequestration. \n \n2.  The PRC\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is the government\u2019s \nlead agency responsible for the implementation of the EPR master plan. The Rural Economy \nDepartment (RED) of NDRC will be the executing agency (EA) for the TA. The EPR Division of \nRED will be the operational focal for the TA and the primary counterpart for the consultant. \n \n3.  The TA\u2019s expected impact is increased social capital investment in EPR projects. The \nexpected outcome\u2014improved policies and management on promoting innovative finance for EPR \ninvestment\u2013will be achieved through implementation of three outputs: (i) innovative financing \nsolutions for ecosystem protection and restoration investment promoted; (ii) options on innovative \necosystem protection and restoration investment financing proposed; and (iii) knowledge on \ninnovative ecosystem protection and restoration investment financing enhanced. The outputs are \ndetailed in paras. 9\u201311 of the TA report\u2019s main text. \n \n4.  To deliver the outputs of this TA, it is proposed to recruit a consulting firm (consultant).4 \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.The consultant will be selected based on full-technical proposals following \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method (quality and cost ratio of 90:10) and engaged under \na partial lump sum contract.5 ADB will post the request for expressions of interest (EOI) on ADB\u2019s \n \n1  This period reflects the uncertain situation with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that may affect the \npreparation of the consultant\u2019s deliverables under the assignment. If travel and gathering conditions allow for a \nfaster implementation, the contract will be closed earlier, upon agreement between NDRC and ADB. \n2  Innovation means change that adds value for clients.

It \nenvisages that EPR projects should promote greenhouse gas emission reduction for eventual carbon emission \ntrading. The greenhouse gas emission reduction would also be through reducing emissions from deforestation and \nforest degradation, as well as conserving and enhancing forest carbon stocks and practicing sustainable forest \nmanagement in the project sites. \n4  Consultants may associate with each other in the form of a joint venture or of a sub-consultancy agreement to \ncomplement their respective areas of expertise, strengthen the technical responsiveness of their proposals, make \navailable bigger pools of experts, and provide better approaches and methodologies. \n5  Remuneration will be paid in shares defined in the contract based on the consultant\u2019s delivery of outputs acceptable \nto NDRC.
