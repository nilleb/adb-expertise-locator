The  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) working group was established by the agreement of country \nadvisors  to  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  5936:  Identification  and  Prioritization  of \nSubregional Projects in South Asia, which was held on 21 \u2013 22 October 2002. The ICT working \ngroup  was  mandated  to  (i)  strengthen  institutional  cooperation  among  relevant  agencies, \nincluding  private  sector  representatives,  for  future  collaborative  undertakings  in  ICT  in  the \nsubregion;  (ii)  discuss  and  agree  on  broad  mechanisms  for  institutional  coordination  and \nconsultation processes for project implementation; and (iii) collectively agree on the steps to \nfacilitate cooperation in ICT in the subregion. \n \n2.  The first meeting of the ICT working group was held in New Delhi, India, on 15 \u2013 16 \nMarch 2004. Its objectives are to develop a cooperation agenda, discuss major issues and \nactivities for ICT development in the SASEC region, and identify priority areas for the SASEC \nICT development master plan that would be developed by TA from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). The working group reached an understanding with the member countries1 and \nADB representatives on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. This TA paper was prepared on the basis of \nthe outcomes reached at the ICT working group meeting, and its review of data, studies, and \nreports.2 The TA is included in the draft Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program, 2004\u2013\n2007, South Asia. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n3.  The potential of ICT in developing countries is relatively large, extending to making \nremote and rural areas reachable, overcoming geographical barriers to provide social services \nsuch as education and health, and thus creating more economic and social opportunities for the \npoor living in remote areas. SASEC countries, however, lag far behind in preparing themselves \nto  make  full  use  of  ICT  for  their  economic  and  social  development  as  demonstrated  by \nunfavorable ICT penetration ratios. The density of main telephone lines ranges from 0.6 to 4.6 \nper 100 inhabitants in SASEC countries compared with more than 50 in East Asia countries and \naround 13.6 for all Asian countries. The density of cellular mobiles phones ranges from 0.2 to \n2.5 per 100 inhabitants compared with more than 70 in East Asia countries and around 15.0 for \nall  Asian  countries.  Internet  users  in  SASEC  countries  range  from  18  to  204  per  10,000 \ninhabitants compared with almost 5,000 in East Asia countries and around 690 for all Asian \ncountries.  \n \n4.  To improve their low teledensities, SASEC countries are in the process of developing \ntheir  ICT  infrastructure  at  an  unprecedented  speed.  In  Bangladesh,  mobile  phones  have \novertaken fixed line phones, and will have its own undersea link by the Southeast Asia-Middle \nEast-Western Europe 4 project by 2005 to overcome the limitation of satellite technology for \ndata communication. Bhutan will soon have undersea links connecting with India and extending \nto Thimphu. Nepal is establishing an East\u2013West superhighway that will link up with Kathmandu \nand  connect  with  the  Indian  terrestrial  networks  in  the  south.  India  has  seen  a  dramatic \nimprovement in telecom infrastructure due largely to deregulation and the participation of the \nprivate sector. India has also experienced significant growth in software exports.  \n \n                                                 \n1     Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and India.  \n2      The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 16 October 2004. ", "2   \n5.  These country-level efforts to build ICT infrastructure can be made more effectively if \nwell-coordinated  on  a  regional  level,  as  SASEC  countries  have  advantages  in  terms  of \ngeographical proximity, common sociocultural characteristics, and economic complementarities \nfor maximizing the benefits from regional cooperation in ICT. Regional cooperation in ICT not \nonly facilitates greater private sector initiative and ensures a healthy regulatory framework, but \nalso promotes efficient ICT network traffic flows and exploits more ICT business opportunities in \nthe region. In addition, regional cooperation in ICT can combine resources, lead to shared \ngateways and exchange of experiences in ICT development plans or policies, and promote \nincreased traffic to flow to and from the region.  \n \n6.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  ICT  for  economic  and  social  development  and  the \npotential  benefits  from  regional  cooperation,  ADB  provided  TA3 and  held  the  Regional \nRoundtable on ICT in Bangalore, India, in 2001 to discuss how to pursue cooperation in ICT in \nthe  region. Participating  countries agreed  that  the  following  priority areas  could  be  further \nexplored as a next step in regional cooperation: (i) expanded telecommunications infrastructure, \n(ii) private-public partnership to promote the use of ICT and develop infrastructure, (iii) human \nresource  development,  and  (iv)  exploitation  of  the  opportunities  of  information  technology- \nenabled services such as running offshore call centers (India as a case in point). The Regional \nRoundtable also recommended establishing mechanisms for multilateral agencies to facilitate \nidentifying and examining areas that would provide opportunities for developing countries in the \nregion. The recommendation of the Regional Roundtable for promoting regional cooperation in \nICT  culminated  in  SASEC\u2019s  decision  to  include  ICT  as  an  additional  priority  sector  under \nregional TA 6010: SASEC Phase II.  \n \n7.  SASEC countries are in different stages of ICT development in terms of penetration of \nICT infrastructure and service provision. During the 1st SASEC ICT working group meeting, \nmember  countries  identified  five  major  areas  of  focus  for  ICT  regional  cooperation:  (i) \nenhancement of regional connectivity via high-bandwidth connections among SASEC countries, \n(ii) establishment of community information centers, (iii) promotion of information sharing and \nhuman  resources  development  in  the  ICT  sector,  (iv)  strengthening  and  harmonization  of \nregulations in the ICT sector, and (v) development of common software tools to enhance digital \ncontent available over the Internet, regardless of language. \n \n8.  Lack  of  regional  connectivity  was  identified  as  a  major  problem  in  connecting  the \ntelecommunications  networks  of  SASEC  countries.  There  is  no  direct  trunk  or  satellite \ntelecommunications link between Bangladesh and Nepal, Bhutan and Nepal, and Bangladesh \nand Bhutan. Traffic between these countries is routed through a third country. The existing route \nof transmission of regional telecommunications traffic is extremely costly and inefficient, which \nadds  to  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  the  subregion.  The  biggest  obstacle  to  regional \nconnectivity is lack of a mechanism of policy harmonization among SASEC countries, which can \nbe improved by SASEC coordination.   \n \n9.  While  India  has  a  large  pool  of  skilled  human  resources  in  the  ICT  sector  in  the \nsubregion, other SASEC countries are seriously constrained in ICT development due to lack of \nqualified human resources. SASEC could be an effective instrument to promote sharing of ICT \nexperiences, knowledge, and best practices. Particularly, the best practices of high-quality and \nhigh-caliber ICT training centers in India can be exported and their success could be replicated \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2001. Small-Scale Technical Assistance for Regional Roundtable on Information and Communication      \nTechnology. Manila. ", "    3\nin other SASEC countries. Further, experiences in building community information centers when \nshared among SASEC countries can lead to savings on the initial learning costs of late-comers.   \n \n10.  Regional interconnectivity and interoperability of ICT networks across SASEC countries \nare hampered by lack of regional regulatory frameworks and technical standards. Lack of \nmechanisms for pricing and revenue sharing on a regional level for cross-border traffic of ICT \nnetwork has constrained interconnection of ICT networks among SASEC countries. Lack of \ncommon technical standards has prevented sharing of certain content materials. SASEC will be \nan effective route for harmonization of technical standards, development of regional regulatory \nframeworks to improve service quality and competition across countries, and creation of a \nsupportive environment to help foster ICT development by the private sector. \n \n11.  ADB  will  be  the  most  effective  facilitator  for  promoting  regional  cooperation  in  ICT \namong SASEC countries since it already supports various SASEC activities that will create a \nsynergy when combined with its involvement in SASEC ICT. The SASEC ICT development \nmaster plan will provide an appropriate guidance for the SASEC ICT working group to steer the \nactivities of regional cooperation to a desirable direction.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The objective of the TA is to foster regional cooperation in ICT among SASEC countries \nToward this objective, the TA aims at (i) promoting regional connectivity in telecommunication \nnetworks,  (ii)  harmonization  of  technical  standards  and  developing  appropriate  regulatory \nregimes for the subregion, (iii) facilitating cooperation in the development of ICT applications for \nthe subregion, and (iv) strengthening the capacity for human resource development in ICT  on a \nregional level. The TA will assist SASEC countries in preparing a SASEC CT development \nmaster plan that will identify potential areas for cooperation among SASEC countries for ICT \ndevelopment on a regional level and develop regional ICT strategies, investment programs, and \nTA activities necessary to ensure regionwide integrated telecommunications and ICT network \nand service.  \n \n13.  The TA will (i) formulate strategies for regional ICT sector development to promote \nregional cooperation; (ii) prepare a regional ICT development master plan, which will, in line with \nthe strategies, set out an action plan for introducing capacity building and human resources \ndevelopment,  and  a  series  of  investment  and  TA  projects  required  to  promote  regional \ncooperation in the ICT sector; and (iii) develop a regulatory framework that supports regional \ncooperation in ICT. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  A SASEC ICT development master plan will be based on the following three pillars: (i) \ninterconnectivity based on convergence in both network (wire/wireless, narrow/broadband) and \nservice (ICT applications such as e-education, e-health, e-government, e-trade, and e-park); (ii) \ncapacity building and human resource development by sharing information and by establishing \nICT regional training institute/scholarship programs; and (iii) regional ICT sector development \nstrategies and regulatory framework. With this perspective, the TA will review the past and \ncurrent situation of the ICT sector in each country in terms of ICT infrastructure development \nand its operation and maintenance, and the extent of use of ICT applications. Consolidating this \nsituation analysis with the assessment of regional ICT sector development potential, the TA will ", "4   \nconduct a demand analysis for each mode of ICT network and applications on a regional level. \nThe TA will also assess the institutional capacity of each country for regulation and service \nprovision, and assess the potential for convergence to a common ICT regulatory environment \non a regional level.    \n \n15.  The SASEC ICT development master plan to be developed will cover a program of \ninvestments  and  TA,  an  action  plan  to  implement  capacity  building  and  human  resources \ndevelopment, and a sustainable financing plan to support the investment and TA program. The \ndetailed TA activities are described in the terms of reference for consulting services in Appendix \n2. \n \n16.  The success of the TA is highly contingent upon whether its output, a long-term plan for \nregional ICT sector development, will be supported by all member countries. Accordingly, it is \nessential to adopt a participatory approach from the beginning of TA implementation, involving \nall  stakeholders  in  each  member  country,  i.e.,  concerned  ministries,  regulators,  service \nproviders,  and  service  users.  The  consultants  will  attend  the  working  group  meeting,  as \nrequired, to update the participants on the progress of the TA and get a consensus for the \ngeneral direction of their work. When the draft master plan is formulated, a workshop will be \norganized for consensus building among the member countries.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $450,000 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange \ncomponent is $327,000 and the local currency component is $123,000 equivalent. The total TA \ncost will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Detailed cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s  Transport  and  Communications  Division,  South  Asia  Department  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  concerned  ministry  in  each  TA  country  will  be  an \nimplementing agency (IA) and coordinate day-to-day implementation of the TA. Each IA will \nappoint a project manager who will act as a focal point for TA implementation. The TA will be \nguided  by  a  steering  committee  to  be  formed  before  the  start  of  the  work.  The  steering \ncommittee will be composed of the standing member of the SASEC ICT working group in each \ncountry, representatives from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe  Pacific,  the  Asia-Pacific  Telecommunity,  and  the  ADB  project  officer.  The  steering \ncommittee meeting will be cochaired by one of the government representatives and ADB. The \nsteering committee will review consultants\u2019 reports, reconcile different views among countries \nand  ADB,  provide  feedback  to  the  consultants,  and  guide  further  implementation.  The \nconsultants will attend the steering committee meetings with broad responsibility for liaison and \ncoordination among committee members. The steering committee will meet at least twice, at \ninception and at the time when the consultants submit the draft master plan.  \n \n19.  The TA will require international consulting services of 10 person-months engaged from \na firm using the biodata technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method,  and  domestic  consulting  services  of  32  person-months  engaged  on  an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The \ninternational consultants will be (i) an ICT sector policy specialist (5 person-months), and (ii) an \nICT network/application specialist (5 person-months). The domestic consultants will be (i) an ", "    5\nICT network specialist (4 person-months in each country), and (ii) an ICT application specialist \n(4 person-months in each country). \n \n20.  The international consultants will be based in India and make periodic trips to each of \nthe other countries as work demands. The IA of India will provide counterpart staff, secretarial \nservice, furnished office space suitable for two international consultants and two domestic \nconsultants, office supplies, local communications including Internet access, and information \nand data on the ICT sector as required by the consultants.  In the other countries, the IA will \nprovide temporary office accommodation. Each IA will assign a team of counterpart staff to work \nwith the consultants in the day-to-day conduct of the study when working in that country. The \nconsulting services are expected to begin on 1 April 2005, and be completed on 31 August \n2005. The consultants will submit the inception report by 15 April 2005, the interim report by 30 \nMay 2005, and the draft final report by 15 August 2005. The consultant will submit the final \nreport within 1 month after each country and ADB send their comments on the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.
