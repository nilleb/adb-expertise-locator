INTRODUCTION\n1. The  Government  of  Indonesia  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for\ntechnical assistance (TA) to facilitate the delivery of business development services (BDS) to\nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs). This TA aims to support the implementation of the key\nfindings and recommendations of the Government-sponsored task force that formulated the\nMedium-Term Action Plan (MTAP) for SMEs.  The MTAP evolved as a result of a policy\ndialogue with ADB and other aid agencies conducted as a part of a policy reform framework\nagreed upon with the Government under the Industrial Competitiveness and SME Development\nProgram1 and implemented under two TAs.2 SME sector growth and performance over the\nyears have been affected by a number of structural issues.  The most significant ones are (i)\ncomplex and costly regulations and licensing requirements; (ii) the lack of adequate BDS, which\nare largely sponsored by the public sector which have either not effectively catered to SME\nrequirements or being subsidy driven have not been sustainable; and (iii) perception that SMEs\nare higher credit risks due to absence of adequate credit information. The proposed TA aims to\naddress  these  three  specific  issues  by  rationalizing  and  streamlining  the  regulations  and\nprocedures for SMEs, developing support for privately-run BDS designed to cater to specific\nSME needs, and developing a credit information system to enhance access to credit by SMEs.\nA Fact-Finding Mission was fielded in March-April 2001, with a Follow-Up Mission in October to\nreach an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, and terms of reference\nof the proposed TA. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Of the 2.8 million industrial establishments in Indonesia, 2.5 million are microenterprises\nand 245,000 are SMEs. Only 7,000 are large enterprises having more than  100  workers.\nMicroenterprises and SMEs play a key role by providing most of the employment in Indonesia\u2019s\nmanufacturing sector: In 1996, of 10.2 million people employed in manufacturing, 6.6 million\nwere employed by microenterprises3 and SMEs, and 3.6 million by large enterprises. While\naccounting for 60 percent of manufacturing employment, microenterprises and SMEs together\ngenerate only 15 percent of manufacturing gross domestic product (11 percent and 4 percent,\nrespectively).  Microenterprises  and  SMEs  have  traditionally  exhibited  much  lower  labor\nproductivity than those in large firms. The productivity gap between small and large firms in\nIndonesia is one of the largest by international standards.\n3. Recognizing  that  SMEs  are  instrumental  in  promoting  industrial  diversification  and\nemployment  generation,  the  Government  has  formulated  a  comprehensive  reform  agenda\nprogram for SMEs.  This program has been developed by an interministerial SME task force  led\nby the State Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMoCSME), the\nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MoIT)  and  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency\n(BAPPENAS). With the support of TA 3417, the task force has formulated an MTAP that\nhighlights major issues and provides a set of recommendations for SME development over the\nperiod 2001-2004. Ineffective and unsustainable BDS, costly regulations, and higher transaction\n                                               \n1 Loan 1738-INO: Industrial Competitiveness and SME Development Program, for $200 million, approved in March\n2000.\n2  TA 3416-INO: Promoting Deregulation and Competition, for $1.5 million, approved in March 2000; and TA 3417-\nINO: Small and Medium Enterprise Development, for $2 million, approved in March 2000. Both TAs accompanied\nto Loan 1738-INO.\n3 This TA concentrates on development of BDS for SMEs, which have greater potential to expand and diversify\nindustrial  production.  ADB  has  provided  technical  assistance  amounting  to  $1.5  million  since  1990  for\nmicroenterprise development.", "2\ncosts in the financial sector represent major structural constraints faced by SMEs. Under the\ndecentralization laws,4 the responsibility for providing BDS has now been delegated to local\ngovernments, which have limited capacity to provide high quality services. Also, regulatory\npowers have been delegated to local governments, creating further confusion and adding more\ncosts to doing business in the regions. Finally, despite extensive subsidized credit programs,\nSMEs continue to be underserved by financial institutions, which perceive them as risky and\nexpensive  credit  operations.  The  MTAP  calls  for  developing  capacities  in  BDS,  further\nstreamlining and simplification of the regulatory and policy environment for SMEs under MoIT\nand SMoCSME, and the establishment of a credit information bureau based on a feasibility\nstudy.\n4. To compete effectively, SMEs need to bring their production costs down by adopting\nsuitable business technologies. Subcontracting is one common route to reduce such overall\ncosts and has played a central role in the successful integration of SMEs into dynamic export-\noriented manufacturing sectors in other countries, such as Japan and the Republic of Korea.\nSubcontracting is as yet not widespread in Indonesia. Whereas SMEs have subcontracting\narrangements in a number of clusters, many of these remain dormant.5 Effectively designed\nBDS by professionals would help SMEs improve their subcontractual arrangements with better\nproduction  technologies,  workplace  organization,  inventory  handling,  product  design,  and\nbusiness planning. The publicly-funded and managed BDS programs have not been successful,\nas these do not conform to international best practices in terms of outreach, sustainability, and\nimpact.6 In general, subsidized BDS programs have been unsustainable and have reached few\nSMEs with services of limited quality and usefulness. These programs have created a culture of\n\u201cright to free services\u201d among the majority of SMEs. As a consequence, BDS in Indonesia has\nnot been demand driven resulting in waste of scarce fiscal resources.\n5. Besides the limited access to information, technology, credit and international markets,\nthe National Development Plan (PROPENAS) acknowledges that Indonesian SMEs face high\ntransaction costs as a result of the cumbersome licensing and regulation requirements, which\nover the years has encouraged inefficient allocation of resources. Official and unofficial levies\nare estimated to raise the direct costs faced by SMEs by as much as 30 percent. In some\nsectors,  SMEs  have  to  secure  as  many  as  eight  licenses,  some  of  which  have  identical\nfunctions but are issued by different agencies. Obtaining licenses takes so long and procedures\nare so complicated that some business owners choose to operate illegally. Lack of legal status\nmakes  it  difficult  for  SMEs  to  get  access  to  formal  services,  most  notably  bank  finance.\nRegulations further obligate state-owned enterprises to contribute funds from their profits to\nfinance  myriad  unsustainable SME credit and other support programs, perpetuating a deeply\nrooted tradition of distorted allocation of resources. Other regulations simply create barriers to\nentry for all enterprises. For instance, some ports refuse to handle cargo other than what they\nare licensed to handle, even though they have adequate infrastructure facilities, thus limiting\ncompetition and increasing the transport costs of all firms, including export-oriented SMEs.\nSome regulations create monopolistic practices, reducing access for all enterprises, including\nSMEs, to key industrial inputs such as tin, oil, basic foods, and timber. Removal of these costly\nregulations will improve SME profitability.\n                                               \n4  Laws 22 and 25, enacted in 1999, and effective on 1 January 2001.\n5  Berry et al. 2001. (forthcoming). Small Industry Dynamics in Indonesia. Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies,\nVol. 37, No. 3, 367-88.\n6 See BDS: A Guide to Donor-Supported Interventions. 2000. Committee of Donor Agencies for SME Development.", "3\n6. Following decentralization, local governments now have the authority to regulate local\nindustry and trade. Districts and municipalities  (kabupaten/kota)  have been  delegated  with\nincreased fiscal authority which suggests the high probability that the local governments will\nincrease taxes, levies, and other fees. For example, the district of Gorontalo in the island of\nSulawesi  has  introduced  17  new  or  revised  SME-related  regulations  for  2001.  Regional\nanticompetitive practices will hinder, not promote, SME development.\n7. Better access to credit for SMEs can accelerate their development. Banks and other\nfinancial institutions generally consider loans to SMEs risky and hence limit their credit exposure\nto these firms. The Government is keen to develop credit information systems to help reduce\nthe adverse perception of SME credit risk among credit providers, and to promote access to\ncredit, especially for SMEs, according to their credit records. A credit information system will\nalso increase the general quality and efficiency of credit analysis and hence improve the access\nof creditworthy SMEs to financial resources.\n8. ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  supports  SME  development  to  ensure  pro-poor\nsustainable  growth.  The  strategy  addresses  identified  constraints  affecting  SMEs  such  as\nineffective BDS, anticompetitive regulations, and lack of access to credit. The strategy also\nemphasizes support for SME development at the regional level consistent with the objectives of\npoverty reduction and decentralization. In line with this strategy, the TA will extend regional\ncoverage to the island of Java, which has the highest concentration of poor. ADB is also\ndeveloping a regional SME strategy for the East ASEAN Growth Area (EAGA), that focuses on\nthe island of Sulawesi.7 SME development in these two regions will help alleviate poverty.\n9. ADB has effectively coordinated its SME development support with other multilateral and\nbilateral agencies. The World  Bank  and  International  Finance  Corporation  have  supported\npromotion of information technology for SMEs. Japan will launch a study of industrial clusters\nand expand its training centers in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Java, and Sulawesi. The United States\nAgency for International Development focuses on strengthening democratic transition, which\nsupports stakeholder participation in SME policy making. The German Agency for Technical\nCooperation is assisting BAPPENAS in the preparation of a regional SME promotion strategy\nwith focus on Central Java. Swisscontact and Asia Foundation are working on SME policy\nreform and nonfinancial services for SMEs in Java, Bali, Sumatra and Sulawesi.8 The proposed\nTA complements and supplements the various initiatives of ADB and other aid agencies.\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n10. The  proposed  TA  aims  to  promote  the  growth  and  development  of  SMEs  by\nstrengthening their capacities for managing their businesses efficiently and improving facilitation\nthrough simplification of regulations as well as access to credit. The TA will offer, on a pilot\nbasis (i) demand-driven quality BDS in line with SMEs\u2019 specific requirements and international\nbest practices; and (ii) one-stop facilitation to overcome the regulatory hurdles faced by SMEs,\nwhile carrying forward the efforts launched to simplify regulations and licensing procedures. The\n                                               \n7  The Kalimantan provinces are also included in East ASEAN Growth Area (EAGA), but the potential of Sulawesi\u2019s\nSMEs is greater than those in Kalimantan at present.\n8 Small Businesses during the Crisis. (forthcoming). ADB, Asia Foundation and Swisscontact.", "4\nTA will further improve access of SMEs to credit by offering banks a credit information system\nthat will help them better assess SME credit risk.\nB.  Scope\n11. The TA has three components:\n(i)  Component  A:  Facilitation  of  Regional  BDS.  This  involves  provision  to\nselected  privately-run  BDS  for  SMEs  in  four  local  governments\n(districts/municipalities) in the provinces of Central Java and South Sulawesi.\nUnder this component, the TA will provide capacity building/training to a core\ngroup  of  BDS  providers  to  train  SMEs  in  a  wide  range  of  areas  such  as\ninternational marketing, basic accounting, preparation of feasibility studies and\nbusiness  plans,  and  use  of  information  technology  in  business  operations.\nBesides improving SMEs\u2019 and local governments\u2019 exposure to private business\npractices, this approach to BDS will generate a core group of service providers\nwho will emerge as professionals in BDS offering privately managed services in\nline with market requirements. The evolution of role-model service providers will\nhave a demonstration effect, offering other service providers (both private and\npublic) an opportunity to learn how to structure BDS in an effective way.\n(ii)  Component B: Regulatory Climate for SMEs. This component will provide\ncapacity building in the four selected districts/municipalities to develop one-stop\nservice  centers  for  licensing.  In  addition,  this  component  will  support  local\ngovernments,  in  coordination  with  MoIT  and  SMoCSME,  in  the  review  and\nmonitoring of business regulations that hinder SME development at the national\nand local levels.\n(iii)  Component C: Development of a Credit Information System. The TA will\nprovide advice to the steering committee led by Bank Indonesia to prepare a\nblueprint  for  the  establishment  and  future  operationalization  of  a  credit\ninformation bureau that will manage credit histories of all enterprises, including\nSMEs.\n12. This TA aims at complementing initiatives led by ADB and other aid agencies in the SME\nsector (see para. 9). The TA targets localities other than those already being targeted by other\naid agencies operating on the islands of Java and Sulawesi to provide training and finance to\nSMEs. A proposed regional TA9 is intended to support coordination of SME policies with other\nparts  of  EAGA  in  2002.  Effective  coordination  with  other  aid  agencies  in  EAGA  will  be\nmaintained during  the  implementation phase of this  TA  to  exploit  synergies.  ADB  is  also\nplanning an advisory TA10 to MoIT for export-oriented SMEs to encourage environment-friendly\nproduction and ecolabeling to gain access to export markets.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The TA is estimated to cost $1.9 million equivalent, comprising  foreign exchange cost of\n$1.181  million  and  local  currency  cost of $0.719  million  equivalent.  The  Government  has\n                                               \n9  Proposed RETA for expansion of the SME development strategy in EAGA to Malaysia and Brunei, based on RETA\n5880: SME Development in EAGA, for $300,000, approved in December 1999.\n10 Proposed TA 35145: Improving SMEs\u2019 Environmental Performance through Cleaner Production.", "5\nrequested ADB to finance $1.5 million equivalent, to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of\n$1.181 million, and $0.319 million equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed\nby ADB on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF), funded by\nthe Government of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $0.4 million equivalent of\nlocal costs. The cost estimates and financing plan of the TA are given in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n14. The Executing Agency for the TA will be BAPPENAS, which will coordinate with the\nthree key implementing agencies at the national level\u2013MoIT, Bank Indonesia and SMoCSME.\nMoIT and SMoCSME will work closely with local governments and Bank Indonesia will lead a\nsteering committee to oversee the work on credit information. BAPPENAS will select four local\ngovernments to participate in the TA, based on their preparedness to adopt the Government\u2019s\nreform  plan contained  in  the  MTAP.  The  selected  local governments,  with  support of  the\nconsultants, will select BDS providers, in accordance with guidelines agreed with ADB.\n15. The  three  TA  components  will  require  118  person-months  of  consulting  services,\nincluding 40 person-months of international consultants, and 78 person-months of domestic\nconsultants over a period of 30 months. The TA will commence in June 2002 and be completed\nby December 2004. All consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  consultants  will  be\nexpected to provide inception, quarterly, and final  reports.  The  terms  of  reference for  the\nconsultants are provided in Appendix 3.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION\n16. The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Indonesia in an amount not exceeding the\nequivalent of $1,500,000 for the purpose of Strengthening Business Development Services for\nSmall and Medium Enterprises.", "6 Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nPerformance Monitoring Assumptions\nDesign Summary\nIndicators/Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal\n\u2022  Improved \u2022  Long-term SME \u2022  Baseline \u2022  Overall favorable\ncompetitiveness performance in assessment at economic conditions\nof small and selected project start and \u2022  The Ministry of\nmedium municipalities end Industry and Trade\nenterprises (annual growth (MoIT) and the State\n(SMEs) in rates in sales, Ministry of\nselected areas by exports, and Cooperatives and\ncreating a employment) Small and Medium\nconducive SME Enterprises\nenvironment with (SMoCSME) will\nregard to continue to support a\nregulatory market-friendly\nframework, approach to SMEs\naccess to\nbusiness\ndevelopment\nservices (BDS)\nand finance\nPurpose\nA.
