INTRODUCTION \n1.  Malaysia  is  at  a  critical  juncture  in  its  development.  It  has  made  huge  strides  in \nsocioeconomic  development  since  the  1970s,  transforming  itself  from  an  underdeveloped \ncountry reliant on natural resources into a middle-income country with a vibrant manufacturing \nsector. While Malaysia has made strong gains, the current situation poses some challenges that \nhave led some to suggest that Malaysia is in a middle-income trap.  \n \n2.  The government has been proactive in taking on these challenges. Specifically, it has \nissued a comprehensive policy framework through the Economic Transformation Programme \n(ETP)1 and the Tenth Malaysia Plan (TMP), 2011\u20132015,2 in recognition that a new economic \nmodel is required. In addition, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has formed an interim \ncountry  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  with  Malaysia  to  support  the  government  in  the \nimplementation  of the ETP  and  the TMP.3 In this  context,  the government  has  requested \ntechnical assistance (TA). The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The key pillars for Malaysia during this rapid economic transformation, as envisioned by \nthe government\u2019s own policies and backed up by International Monetary Fund and ADB reports, \ninclude  (i)  economic  growth  that  is  led  by  the  private  sector;  (ii)  market  liberalization  to \nencourage trade and investment; and (iii) macroeconomic stability with its corresponding policy \ntools for inclusive growth. 5 The ratio of investment to Malaysia\u2019s GDP has stagnated to below \n10% for more than a decade, compared with an average of more than 30% during the mid\u2013\n1990s. With the government\u2019s fiscal deficit now projected to widen in 2011, the ETP envisages \nthat investments will largely come from an increase in private capital or via public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs).  Direct  private  sector  investments  that  support  inclusive  growth  and \npromote an environment conducive to business will include ensuring Malaysia\u2019s export financing \nis geared toward strengthening exporting activities. The need to support export financing from \ninstitutions like Eximbank is particularly important as export expansion moderated to 10.4% on a \nyear-on-year basis in the third quarter from 26.2% in the first half of 2010. The downturn in major \nindustrialized  economies  will  require  diversification  of  exports  and  promotion  of  trade  and \ninvestment with emerging and nontraditional markets. These initiatives for strengthening exports \nand regional market development will leverage on regional initiatives involving the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines \nEast  ASEAN  Growth  Area,  and  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand  Growth  Triangle.  While \nMalaysia  has  been  successful  in  reducing  poverty,  some  population  segments  in  certain \ngeographic locations remain at risk. In the TMP, attention will shift towards the bottom 40% of \nincome households. As the economy undergoes structural transformation, macroeconomic tools \nto help evaluate the effects of government policy at the household level will be critical in \nassessing access to growth. \n \n4.  Based on the above, an interim CPS has been formulated with the objective of helping \nMalaysia get out of the middle-income trap through private sector development (including PPPs) \n                                                \n1  The ETP was issued in 2010 to support the implementation of the TMP with a set of sector-specific and thematic \nprojects and programs (called entry point projects).  \n2  Government of Malaysia, Economic Planning Unit. 2010.

Manila.  \n ", "2   \nand  regional  cooperation  and  integration  (RCI),  particularly  by  reinforcing  outward  and \ncommercial orientation. To this end, the major development issues to be addressed by ADB are \nas follows: \n \n(i)  National anchoring of RCI. Anchoring RCI at the national level has the dual \nbenefit  of  contributing  to  Malaysia\u2019s  development  goals  and  supporting  the \ndevelopment of neighboring countries. The outward orientation inherent in this \napproach supports Malaysia\u2019s efforts to emerge from the middle-income trap \nthrough more competitive and broader trade and investment opportunities.  \n \n(ii)  Catalyzing  private  investment.  Malaysia\u2019s  key  economic  challenge  is  to \ndevelop its private sector. By promoting a commercial orientation, development \nfinance institutions (DFIs) can, for example, boost the ability of Malaysian private \nenterprises to take advantage of regional market opportunities. ADB can support \nprojects that  catalyze  private  sector  participation,  including  PPPs,  to finance \ninfrastructure.  \n \n(iii)  Maximizing  knowledge  partnership.  The  government  aims  to  promote \ninclusive  growth.  Expanding  human  capital  development  and knowledge  and \ncapacity development efforts will be important in this regard. In addition, as the \neconomy goes through the structural transformation envisaged by the TMP and \nETP, a macroeconomic tool to monitor the inclusive growth will be needed.  \n \nThe TA aims to support the government\u2019s efforts in ensuring macroeconomic stability with \ninclusive growth and in enabling new engines of growth for an economy during a period of \nstructural transformation. To help tackle these issues, knowledge and capacity development TA \nis required that can assist in (i) monitoring various aspects of inclusive growth during a period of \nstructural  transformation,  (ii)  promoting  PPP-enabling  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  and \nfinancing, and (iii) encouraging outward-oriented private sector development based on vibrant \nexport growth with effective export financing\u2014which in turn will encourage partnership in global \nand regional production networks. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The  overall  impact  will  be  stronger  development  of  Malaysia  through  effective \nimplementation of the TMP and ETP. This will be based on continued efforts for better outward \nand commercial orientation, leading to a more integrated region. Based on the interim CPS, the \ngovernment  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  via  provision  of  knowledge  and  capacity \ndevelopment. In particular, the consultation between the government and ADB has led to the \nidentification of key strategic thrusts for the structural transformation of the economy and its \nimpact (as envisioned in the TMP and ETP) to be supported by ADB. Specifically, and as stated \nin the TMP and ETP, the economic transformation of Malaysia is to be based on private sector \ndevelopment,  with  stronger  outward  and  commercial  orientation  of  key  institutions.  This \ntransformation would need to be accompanied by inclusive growth for Malaysia.  \n \n6.  The overall outcome of the TA is improved capacity of selected entities to implement \nTMP  and  ETP,  particularly  in  regard  to  the  following  three  key  strategic  priorities:  (i) \ndevelopment  of  macroeconomic  policy  tools  based  on  robust  databases  and  modeling  to \nmeasure the impact of structural transformation on inclusive growth in terms of household \nincomes; (ii) promotion of private sector development by catalyzing additional investments, \n ", "  3 \nwhich includes PPP financing opportunities and enabling policy and regulatory reforms; and (iii) \nsupport  for  stronger  commercial  and  outward  (export-driven)  orientation.  These  areas  are \nconsistent with the government\u2019s policy framework as noted above, and are considered key \nfacets  of  economic  transformation  for  Malaysia.  While  the  TA  cannot  support  all  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s policies, it can have a catalytic impact with a tangible demonstration of ADB\u2019s \nengagement. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  To achieve the TA outcomes, the TA contains three components which are based on the \nstrategic pillars of the interim CPS. They are designed to provide enhanced capacity and \nknowledge support in the key areas of the TMP and ETP implementation. Further description of \nthe components is below.  \n \n(i)  National anchoring of RCI (support for export financing). This component will \ntarget the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia (Eximbank Malaysia) and SME Bank. \nBased on the interim CPS, ADB will initiate a project financing development with \nEximbank  Malaysia  to  strengthen  cross-border  and  regional  trade  and \ninvestment initiatives, and to support clean energy finance across the region. To \nensure  that  ADB\u2019s  financing  support  is  complemented  by  its  capacity \ndevelopment support, this TA component will focus on the areas of internal risk \nmanagement and project risk analysis, as well as upgrading trade and clean \nenergy finance to develop value-added services that foster regional trade and \ninvestment. In addition to its own outputs, the TA will arrange for a training \nprogram to be implemented with other export-import banks in the region.  \n \n(ii)  Catalyzing private investment (support for PPP financing). The TA will help \nexamine the constraints on PPPs with the target of improving the procedural and \nother administrative processes to catalyze additional private sector investments. \nIt  is  important that  Malaysia\u2019s  PPP  policies  and  procedural requirements  be \nclosely  aligned  with  international  best  practice.  With  this,  the  TA  can  help \npinpoint a potential pool of private and/or PPP-based projects that could be \nfinanced by private and international sources.  \n \n(iii)  Maximizing  knowledge  partnership  (support  for  macroeconomic  policy). \nThis  component  will  draw  from  and  complement  the  work  of  ADB  TA  for \nStrengthening  Planning  Capacity  for  Low-Carbon  Growth  in  Developing  Asia \nwhich was launched in 2010 to develop a computable general equilibrium (CGE) \nmodel concentrating on the economic impact of climate change.6 Building on \nsimilar assumptions, variables, and base data used in this CGE model, this TA \nwill further improve the CGE model to estimate the impact of government policies \nand external shocks on different types of households in the Malaysian economy. \nThe main activities include the provision of hands-on training to the modeling \nteam and local counterparts on how to construct a social accounting matrix (SAM) \nbased  on  a  CGE  model.  Various  capacity  development  and  dissemination \nactivities  will  be  required,  including  participation  from  universities,  research \ninstitutes, etc.  \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Enabling Climate Change Responses in Asia and the Pacific\u2013Strengthening \nPlanning Capacity for Low Carbon Growth in Developing Asia (TA 7645 [Subproject 4], for $1,420,000, approved \non 10 November). \n ", "4   \n8.  Based on the above, the TA is designed to have three sets of outputs:  \n \n(i)  The  export  financing  component  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (a) \nrecommendations to improve internal risk management and project risk analysis \nof  DFIs,  and  on  rectifying  known  areas  of  operational  weaknesses  through \ninstitutional capacity building; (b) detailed training, workshops, and seminars as \ndeemed appropriate; and (c) demonstrable improvement of staff's knowledge \napplication in financial products and project life cycles, including guidance to \nrespective advisory units.  \n(ii)  The private and PPP financing component will have these technical outputs: \n(a) recommendations on enhanced PPP financing procedures to develop priority \nprojects, including removal of potential constraints to international financing; and \n(b) identification of opportunities for PPP financing, including those related to \nsocial infrastructure such as vocational training.7  \n \n(iii)  The macroeconomic policy component will have detailed technical outputs on the \ndevelopment of policy tools for effective macroeconomic management, including \nfurther development of a CGE model, which are interlinked and fine-tuned with \nother economic modules. This will also entail the preparation of training and \ndocumentation manuals, and conduct of training in the design of country-specific \nsocial policies (with the SAM and others) and instruments and key strategic \nscenarios based on linked and hybrid model analysis.  \n \nThese TA outputs are based on the strategic framework of engagement between ADB and the \ngovernment as described above. They further represent areas of expertise and experience for \nADB. In particular, as the TA is on a reimbursable basis, ADB needs to deliver high-quality \noutputs on a timely basis, with inputs from relevant departments. Accordingly, the outputs have \nbeen tailored to ensure effective delivery based on the TA\u2019s duration and resource availability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million equivalent. It is proposed that ADB will \nfinance an estimated amount of $1 million from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nOthers) on reimbursable basis. Detailed procedure for reimbursement will be prepared as part \nof the overall TA agreement. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented from 15 February 2012 to 15 February 2013, and the \nEconomic Planning Unit (EPU) will be the executing agency. The EPU will be responsible for \noverall coordination between the Malaysian institutions involved in the TA. On ADB's part, the \nSoutheast  Asia  Department's  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations  Coordination  Division \n(SERC) will be the focal point. As ADB will need to provide its utmost knowledge and capacity \ndevelopment support under the TA, a number of divisions within the Southeast Asia Department \nand other ADB departments will work with the various implementing agencies: \n \n                                                \n7  After the identification of potential projects, ADB and the relevant Malaysian institutions are expected to engage in \nfurther discussions on modalities of support on project structuring. Due to the high resource requirements for PPP \nproject structuring, this TA is not expected to undertake the full range of activities.  The TA will identify an \nappropriate set of areas to be supported per each of the potential projects as a screening process, based on the \ngovernment\u2019s policy framework and ADB\u2019s proposed PPP Operations Plan. \n ", "  5 \n(i)   For the economic modeling component, the implementing agency will be the \nEPU;  SERC  will  work  with  the  Economic  Research  Department  to  ensure \ncoordination with its TA on CGE modeling8 . \n \n(ii)   For  the  DFI  component,  the  implementing  agency  will  be  the  Bank  Negara \nMalaysia (in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and relevant DFIs); SERC \nwill coordinate with the Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division \nof the Southeast Asia Department.  \n \n(iii)   For the PPP component, the implementing agencies will be the Performance \nManagement Delivery Unit and the PPP Unit (UKAS) within the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice; SERC will coordinate with the other sector divisions in its department, and \nwith ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. Additional support can be \ngiven  by  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and \ncommunity of practice on PPP.  \n \nAs noted above, this coordinated approach takes into account both the need to ensure effective \nimplementation of the TA and the broad knowledge base available within ADB. \n \n11.   A group of individual consultants (and firms as appropriate9) will provide the advisory, \ntechnical, and administrative support services. In total, it is estimated that about 25 person-\nmonths of international consulting services and about 50 person-months of national consulting \nservices  are  required  for  the  TA\u2019s  three  components.  Due  to  the  diverse  skills  required, \nconsultants will be engaged on an individual basis (or through a firm for each of the three main \ncomponents)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). SERC staff will review the outputs in coordination with the relevant \nADB departments.  The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n12.   Purchases  of  equipment  (computer  hardware  and  software)  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and in \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  the  Office  of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. After TA completion, any procured equipment will be \ndisposed of in compliance with Project Administration Instruction 5.09. Disbursements under the \nproject will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a reimbursable \nbasis to the Government of Malaysia for Supporting the Tenth Malaysia Plan, 2011\u20132015, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n8  See footnote 6.  \n9  If a firm is to be selected, then it would be based on the quality-based selection process.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets and  Reporting \nIndicators  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption  \nStronger  Greater outward and  Various reports,  The national policies will be \ndevelopment of  commercial  databases, and  geared toward harnessing the \nMalaysia through  orientation for  publications on the  full benefits of regional \neffective  Malaysia, leading to  economic  integration. \nimplementation of  a more integrated  development of \nRisk \nthe TMP and ETP   region  Malaysia and the \nregion   The global economic downturn \nIncreased private \ncould lead to a policy shift toward \nsector investments  Analyses and \ndomestic economic concerns and \ninto the economy.   evaluations from the \ndelay implementation of the \ngovernment, private \nPolicy and  proposed initiatives.  \nsector, key \nregulatory \nstakeholders, and \nframework improved \nADB staff \ntoward a more \nenabling   \nenvironment for the \nprivate sector \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved  Stronger capacity of  Various reports,  Malaysia continues to recognize \ncapacity of  DFIs on risk  databases, and  knowledge and capacity \nselected entities  management and  publications on the  development support for \nto implement  project analysis   economic  outward and commercial \nTMP and ETP  development of  orientation as important for \nMore conducive \nMalaysia and the  boosting economic growth. \nenvironment for \nregion.  \nprivate and PPP  Close cooperation between \nfinancing   Analyses and  ADB and key stakeholders \nevaluations from the  (including development \nEnhanced macro-\ngovernment, private  agencies and the private sector) \neconomic policy and \nsector, key  will be ensured.  \ninclusive growth \nstakeholders, and \nanalysis   Risk \nADB staff \n  Lack of active participation by \n \nsome stakeholders could hamper \nthe efforts to forge a clear \nconsensus on the key issues.  \nOutputs       Assumption \nInternal risk  Eximbank\u2019s internal  Eximbank business  Availability and interest of experts, \nmanagement and  risk management  procedural records  the government\u2019s ministries and \nproject risk  procedures at par  line agencies, and stakeholders  \n \nanalysis capacity  with international \nRisk \nof DFIs improved  best standards    \nThe TA project is unable to \nEximbank\u2019s project  Eximbank business \nprovide timely outputs of high \nrisk analysis  procedural records \nquality to forge a consensus \nprocesses at par \namong the various development \nwith international \npartners.  \nbest practices  \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets and  Reporting \nIndicators  Mechanisms \nRecommendations  Report on  Prime Minister\u2019s   \non enhanced PPP  recommendations to  Departmental records  \nfinancing  enhance the PPP \n \nprocedures and  market for catalytic \npriority projects  projects provided to   \ndeveloped.
