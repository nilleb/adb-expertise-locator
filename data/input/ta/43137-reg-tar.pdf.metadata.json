INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Following the approval by the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nof a comprehensive review of the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in 2008,1 OED was \nmade more independent from ADB Management and renamed the Independent Evaluation \nDepartment  (IED)  effective  January  2009.  IED  streamlined  its  internal  organization  for \nevaluation  studies,  strategy,  quality,  and  knowledge  dissemination  activities  to  ensure \nconsistency with ADB's long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),2 drivers of \nchange, and core specialization. Evaluation activities were aligned with operations groups 1 and \n2, adjustments were made in the staff skills mix effective February 2009, and IED's work \nprogram was refined.  \n \n2.  IED is continuing with its efforts to ensure that its evaluation program is strategic and \nintegrated.3  IED\u2019s  3-year  work  program  is  developed  in  consultation  with  ADB's  Board  of \nDirectors\u2019  Development  Effectiveness  Committee  (DEC),  Management,  and  operations \ndepartments.  The  work  program  takes  into  account  the issues  of  relevance  to  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) and ADB\u2019s current institutional priorities. DEC, which provides overall \nguidance to IED, endorsed the latter's work program for 2009\u20132011 on 17 September 2008. The \nwork program was approved by the Board on 4 December 2008.4 \n \n3.  The IED work program is driven by three main considerations: (i) aligning with the \nstrategic and thematic priorities of Strategy 2020 and Asian Development Fund (ADF) X, and \nproviding input to future policies (reviews), strategies, and programs of ADB; (ii) providing real-\ntime feedback and capacity building to the regional departments and DMCs (real-time feedback \nprogram);  and  (iii)  contributing  to  knowledge  solutions  (knowledge  program).  IED  will  \n(i) continue to ensure that topics in the work program are strategically relevant to ADB and its \nDMCs; (ii) properly sequence evaluations so that those done early in the 3-year period feed into \nthose planned for later years; (iii) increase the number of broad strategic evaluations of policies \nand themes, sectors, country operations, and institutional development issues; (iv) improve the \nevaluative  content  of  IED  annual  reports  on  portfolio  management  and  evaluation  results  \n(v) prepare and revise evaluation guidelines; (vi) strengthen self-evaluation and the validation \nprocess  of  all  project/program  completion  reports  and  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS) \ncompletion  reports;  and  (vii)  promote  knowledge  management,  including  dissemination  of \nfindings and recommendations in accessible and clearly understandable ways.  \n \n4.  IED's 2009 work program (Appendix 1) comprises 43 evaluation reports and studies \n(including 4 evaluation reports and studies carried over from the previous year's program). Of \nthese, 38 are to be delivered in 2009: 3 annual evaluation reports, 4 country assistance program \nevaluations  (CAPEs),  1  CPS  completion  report,  7  sector  assistance  program  evaluations \n(SAPEs), 6 special evaluation studies (SESs), 10 sovereign and 3 nonsovereign performance \nevaluations of ADB-assisted operations, 1 rigorous impact evaluation, 1 evaluation brief on \ndevelopment outcomes of private sector development, and 2 joint evaluations. Further, the \nCAPE and SAPE guidelines will be revised.    \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n3  IED\u2019s functions are to (i) assess the performance of completed projects and programs; (ii) review and validate the \nself-evaluation  activities  of  the  operations  departments;  (iii) provide  feedback  for  the  design  and  review  of \nstrategies, policies, and operations; (iv) monitor and report on responses of ADB departments and executing \nagencies to evaluation findings and recommendations; (v) build evaluation capacity in DMCs; and (vi) harmonize \nevaluation practices and share evaluation experience with other multilateral development banks through the \nEvaluation Cooperation Group.  \n4  IED\u2019s work program is available at http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/work_prog.asp  \n ", "                   \n2     \n \n5.  The  2009  work  program  will  also  focus  on  providing  real-time  feedback  to  ADB \noperations departments through review of project documents at the early stages of the project \ncycle, selective participation in midterm reviews and CPS reviews, assessment of selected \nongoing projects,5 and review and validation of about 30 project completion reports. Evaluation \nfindings  will  be  proactively  disseminated  to  the  relevant  audiences  through  workshops, \npublications, evaluation information briefs, and learning curves. IED is also actively collaborating \nand coordinating with the counterpart evaluation departments of other multilateral development \nbanks.6    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  Evaluation at ADB has evolved in response to the institution\u2019s changing focus. Over the \nyears, this has evolved to cover the entire results chain of inputs, outputs, outcomes, impacts, \nand their sustainability. The focus of evaluation studies has shifted from the project to the \nsector, country, and regional level. The full mix of lending and nonlending services that make up \ncountry assistance programs has become the dominant preoccupation of broader evaluations \n(i.e., country  and  sector  assistance  evaluations,  thematic  evaluations,  and  rigorous  impact \nevaluations), with priority attention to relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability. \nFurther,  in  light  of  the  general  capital  increase  and  related  issues,  ADB  is  placing  more \nemphasis on improving development effectiveness and impacts in the future, and on evidence-\nbased independent evaluations. Accordingly, better impact analysis is needed at a macro level \nin the core sectors that represent the current and future priorities of ADB.  \n \n7.  Since  1997,  broader  evaluations,  and  promotion  and  dissemination  of  evaluation \nproducts have been financed through technical assistance (TA). Broader evaluations, which are \nmulti-activity, multicountry, and multisector in nature, are more complex and have benefited \nfrom this responsive approach to providing consulting and other services. An allocation of about \n$1.7 million for a regional TA is included in the indicative planning figures for 2009. Actually, the \nselected evaluation studies for 2009 will be undertaken in two phases through two regional \nresearch and development TAs. The regional research and development TA for the selected \nevaluation studies for 2009 to be undertaken in phase 1 (the present TA) is described below. \nSubsequently, another regional research and development TA for 2009, to be undertaken in \nphase 2, will be processed once the list of evaluation studies to be included in this second \nphase is confirmed.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be to help ADB as a learning institution to continuously improve \nthe development effectiveness of its operations and policies. The outcome will be timely and \npractical findings and recommendations to support the formulation and implementation of new \nCPSs, sector strategies, policies, and operations. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 2. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

An Evaluation \nInformation Brief with real-time lessons from processing and implementing this ongoing project was uploaded on \nthe ADB website in March 2009.  \n6 IED participates in activities organized by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral development banks, \nand the Evaluation Network of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. \n \n ", "3 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  An  evaluation  approach  paper  (EAP)  outlining  the  scope,  methodology,  resource \nrequirements, and terms of reference will be prepared for each of the broad evaluation studies \nbefore consultants are engaged and the studies commence. The views of relevant ADB staff \nand government entities will be sought and reflected, as appropriate, in the final version of the \nstudy. Existing ADB knowledge products and services will be sought and leveraged. Each EAP \nwill contain a dissemination plan to build meaning and understanding, develop support, and \ngenerate learning opportunities. The following key activities are envisaged.  \n \n10.  Country Assistance Program Evaluation. As envisaged in the work plan IED will \nundertake evaluation of ADB\u2019s country strategies and programs for several countries such as \nBangladesh, Bhutan, and Lao People's Democratic Republic. The CAPE will (i) assess and rate \nADB\u2019s strategic positioning, institutional performance, value addition/ contribution to long-term \ndevelopment  results,  and  sector-level  performance;  (ii)  draw  forward-looking  lessons  and \nidentify good practices; and (iii) develop directional recommendations for the next CPS. The \nCAPE will assess the operations of the past 10 years and assistance not covered by the \nprevious  CAPE.  The  CAPE  will  also  assess  the  progress  of  the  implementation  of \nrecommendations of any previous CAPE. \n \n11.  Sector  Assistance  Program  Evaluations.  Depending  on  country  and  sector \nrequirements, sector/thematic assessments will be undertaken to feed into the main CAPE \nreports. SAPEs evaluate ADB's sectoral strategy, policy dialogue, and ongoing and completed \nprojects and TAs, and ADB's performance within a given sector in one country. They focus on \nthe sectors that received the most assistance or are key sectors in ADB\u2019s strategies in a \ncountry.  \n \n12.  Special Evaluation Study on the Performance of ADB's Water Sector Policy and \nOperations. The SES will build on previous IED and other relevant ADB studies. Its focus will \nbe on evaluating the relevance, compliance, effectiveness, and impact of the ADB's water \npolicy.7 The SES will (i) examine specific features of the ADB water policy, including its intent, \ndirectives, safeguards, and development approaches; (ii) assess the adequacy, coverage, and \nrelevance of the water policy to ADB operations, taking into account current and emerging \nregional and global issues on water use, climate change, and related issues; (iii) assess the \npolicy's  comprehensiveness,  consistency,  and  robustness  from  a  technical  perspective \n(reflective of current technical and scientific understanding); (iv) examine the extent to which the \nwater policy has been taken into consideration in project design and implementation; (v) assess \nthe effectiveness and impact of the water policy by examining the performance of ADB water \nsector assistance before and after the implementation of the policy and by identifying trends that \ncan be attributed to the policy; and (vi) identify lessons learned and issues to be considered in \nguiding ADB water sector assistance in the future. The SES will be undertaken through (i) a \ndesk review, (ii) a before-and-after comparison of water policy implementation, (iii) an in-depth \nstudy of successful projects, (iv) focus-country studies, (v) thematic studies, and (vi) internal and \nexternal outreach activities.  \n \n13.  Special Evaluatlon Study on ADB's Support to Gender and Development. The \nobjective of this SES is to evaluate and draw lessons from the implementation of ADB's gender \nand  development  (GAD)  policy's  mainstreaming  activities  from  May  1998.8  This  involves \n                                                 \n7  ADB 2001.

Cost and Financing  \n \n14.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program (TASF-other resources). Details of the cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise \nthe preparation of reports for each evaluation study. Based on experience with similar studies in \nthe past, about 20 person-months of international and about 32 person-months of national \nconsulting services will be required. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. Detailed \nterms of reference will be developed in the evaluation approach papers before action is taken to \nengage consultants. All consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA will \nstart in May 2009 and be completed in December 2010. Implementation arrangements will be \nflexible enough to allow changes should IED\u2019s work program be altered, including, as needed, \nresponding to priorities under Strategy 2020 (footnote 2) and ADF X.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nSelected Evaluation Studies for 2009-Phase 1, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \n2009 WORK PROGRAM \n \nI.

SAPEs evaluate ADB's sectoral, strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing, and completed \nprojects  and  TAs,  and  ADB's  performance  within  a  given  sector  in  one  country.    Their \npreparation will require the services of sector/theme specialists (both international and national). \nThe  international  consultants  (4  person-months  of  total  inputs)  are  expected  to  (i)  update \nreviews  of  ADB-financed  assistance  programs  and  assess  their  relevance,  effectiveness, \nsustainability, and impact toward the strategic sector objectives; (ii) undertake key informant \ninterviews and conduct stakeholder surveys on the outcome and impact of ADB assistance, and \ndiscuss sector development issues and concerns with executing agencies (EAs) and other \ngovernment and nongovernment entities, as appropriate; and (iii) help assess the validity of \nADB\u2019s sector development strategies in their respective study country. \n \n5.  With attention to country and sector requirements, national sector/theme specialists  \n(4 person-months of total inputs) with previous exposure to sector development issues in the \nstudy country will be recruited to (i) present an overview of the relevance and implementation of \nADB sectoral strategies; (ii) assess and rate the achievement of project and program objectives \nand the delivery of core sectors and crosscutting/thematic programs; (iii) comment on ADB\u2019s \ninstitutional positioning and performance in a sector; (iv) organize and facilitate focus group \ndiscussions, workshops, and meetings; and (v) identify important issues and lessons identified \nin a sector\u2019s operations. \n \n6.  Special Evaluation Study on ADB's Support to Gender and Development (GAD). \nThe study will require one international consultant (5 person-months of total inputs), who will \nfurther  develop  the  evaluation  criteria  that  consists  of  the  scope  of  the  GAD  policy, \nimplementation of the GAD policy, and outcomes of it through selected country case studies. \nThe international consultant will also (i) further analyze the data and findings from the desk \nreview  segment;  (ii)  identify  good  practice  cases  on  gender  mainstreaming  across  the \nimplementation  of  the  GAD  policy;  (iii)  develop  the  in-house  literature  review;  (iv)  design \nstructured interviews for focal points in regional departments (RDs) and the Regional and \nSustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD),  as  well  as  gender  specialists  in  resident \nmissions, and selected EAs; (v) disaggregate good practice notes; (vi) plan and manage field \nvisits in the selected country results case studies; (vii) analyze findings; and (viii) prepare a draft \n ", "Appendix 4  11 \nfinal report based on the above top-down desk reviews and bottom-up country results case \nstudies.  \n \n7.  This study will require one national consultant (7 person-months of total inputs) primarily \nto work on the desk review segment of the evaluation to cover implementation of the GAD \npolicy. The national consultant is expected to perform the following tasks as part of the desk \nreview segment of the evaluation: (i) prepare the list of reports to be covered in the desk review; \n(ii)  develop  guidance  questionnaires  for  the  assessment  as  part  of  the  evaluation  team;  \n(iii) administer the guidance questionnaire for each identified report; and (iv) tabulate findings \nand prepare evidence for questions related to what has worked, what has not, and why. \n \n8.  This study will also need the services of national consultants from the study countries  \n(1 person-month each). Each of the planned two or three country results case studies will be \nbased on a stakeholder and/or beneficiary assessment, to be undertaken by a local consultant \n(or  a  team  of  consultants)  under  the  supervision  of  the  international  consultant.  Specific \nresponsibilities include (i) selection of localities, (ii) design of the structured questionnaire,  \n(iii)  selection  of  the  interviewees  (beneficiaries  and  nonbeneficiaries),  (iv)  preparation  of  \ntimetable and modalities for interviews, (v) managing of costing information, and (vi) preparation \nof a report on findings from each stakeholder assessment. \n \n9.  Special Evaluation Study on the Performance of ADB's Water Sector Policy and \nOperations. The SES will require a total consultant input of 17 person-months, consisting of  \n8 person-months of international and 9 person-months of national experts. The SES will be \nundertaken  through  (i)  a  desk  review,  (ii)  before-and-after  comparison  of  water  policy1 \nimplementation,  (iii)  in-depth  study  of  successful  projects,  (iv)  country-focus  studies,  and  \n(v) thematic studies.  \n \n10.  The desk review will cover all ADB water sector projects approved since 2001 as well as \nprojects nearing approval. The evaluation format will use quantitative scoring to assess the \ncompliance of these projects with respect to the ADB's water policy. Compliance, in this context, \nrefers to the extent to which the project\u2019s objectives and design are intended to promote various \npriority areas specified in the ADB's water policy.  \n \n11.  ADB water sector projects approved since 1995 will be included in the before-and-after \ncomparison. Projects will be divided into two groups: those approved between 1995 and 2001, \nand  those  between  2002  and  2008,  and  the  two  groups  of  projects  will  be  compared \nsystematically by focusing on project designs, implementation, and performance. The main \nquestion for this analysis is: did compliance with the ADB's water policy help to improve the \nperformance of water sector projects?  \n \n12.  About  8\u201310  successful  projects  will  be  selected  for  the  in-depth  studies  to  identify \nlessons for broader application. The main objectives of such in-depth studies are to illustrate the \nchallenges of applying the ADB's water policy in the institutional context of both ADB and \nDMCs, and how innovative strategies can be used to overcome these challenges. Beside \nsecondary data based on project documents, a survey will be conducted among project staff \nwith regard to the design, implementation, and evaluation of selected projects. In addition, in-\ndepth  interviews  and  focus  group  discussions  will  be  held  with  ADB  staff,  government \nrepresentatives, and participants in and beneficiaries of the selected projects.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

The  country-focus  studies  will  examine  ADB\u2019s  role  in  improving  water  sector \nperformance in the developing member countries. The main objectives for country-focus studies \nare to (i) assess the impact of the ADB's water policy at the country level, (ii) assess the \ndevelopment effectiveness of Water Policy priorities and approaches in light of the changing \nenvironment in these countries in the near future, and (iii) review areas of the water sector \nwhere ADB can use its comparative advantages to make a strategic contribution. Country-focus \nstudies will be conducted for about five countries to be selected later. In conducting the studies, \nsemi-structured interviews and focus group discussions will be held with (i) policymakers in key \ngovernment  agencies  responsible  for  water  resource  management  and  planning,  \n(ii)  representatives  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  (iii)  project  implementers \n(government officials and consultants), (iv) representatives from international and local civil \nsociety organizations, and (v) the private sector.  \n \n14.  Thematic  studies  will  be  conducted  to  investigate  important  issues  that  cannot  be \nadequately treated in the desk review, in-depth studies of successful projects, and country-focus \nstudies. The main objectives of the thematic studies will be to (i) review areas of the water \nsector where ADB can use its comparative advantages to make a strategic contribution; and  \n(ii)  assess  the  evolution  of  ADB\u2019s  internal  capacity  in  water  sector  operations\u2014staff \nqualifications, training programs, documentation and coordination with other agencies. Some \ntentative topics for thematic studies include (i) new types of investment in the water sector \narising from climate change, (ii) corporate governance and capacity building for water utilities, \n(iii)  improving  public  sector  performance,  and  (iv)  the  relationship  between  ADB  internal \norganization and the ADB Water Policy. In addition to a desk review, a staff survey, key \ninformant interviews, and focus group discussions will be used to collect data for the thematic \nstudies.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090624152340+08'00'", "Author": "Sangay Penjor", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090722151605+08'00'", "Title": "Selected Evaluation Studies for 2009-Phase 1"}}
