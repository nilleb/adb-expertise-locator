INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  1999,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  (the  Government)  developed  a \nframework  for  attracting  private  investments  in  infrastructure  through  a  public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) approach. The Korean framework for private participation in infrastructure \ninvolves  the  public  and  private  sectors  working  in  cooperation  and  partnership  to  provide \ninfrastructure and public services. This framework has resulted in the development of 44 types \nof infrastructure facilities in 15 categories (covering sectors such as transport, urban, energy, \ncommunications,  environment,  and  social)  and  has  been  attracting  increasing  investments \nthrough private sector participation (PSP) over the years.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has identified the PPP approach in its long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)1 as an important tool in enabling developing \nmember countries (DMCs) to increase investments for the development of infrastructure. The \nGovernment  and  ADB  have  established  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership Fund (administered by ADB) to support the sharing of experience, information, and \nknowledge in the Asia and Pacific region. The main goal of this fund is to reduce poverty and \npromote economic and social development in DMCs through this sharing, thereby strengthening \nthe capacity of DMCs to achieve the goal. \n \n3.  The Government has approved funding of this regional technical assistance (RETA) \nfrom this fund as per the letter dated 5 June 2008 sent by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea. \n \n4.  Using  this  fund,  the  RETA  aims  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  DMCs  by  sharing \nknowledge and experience of successful PPP country frameworks and project case studies. \nThis is expected to contribute to the formulation and strengthening of appropriate PPP policy \nand legal, institutional, and financial frameworks, and their application to develop and implement \nPPP infrastructure projects. Increased private sector investments in infrastructure are expected \nto contribute to infrastructure and economic development within the DMCs.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Increased investments in infrastructure and social services are needed for enhancing \nand  sustaining  economic  growth.  It  is  estimated  that  developing  countries  must  spend  an \nestimated 6%\u20137% of gross domestic product (GDP) annually on infrastructure; for lower-income \ncountries, the target could be as high as 7%\u20139%. Developing countries today spend an annual \naverage of 3%\u20134% of GDP on infrastructure. At these rates, the Asia and Pacific region will take \nabout half a century to reach the industrialized world standards. The Asia and Pacific region \nwas projected to need about $250 billion annually (6% of regional GDP) during the period 2005\u2013\n2010 out of the world\u2019s total requirement of about $850 billion. This is significantly higher than \nthat of Sub-Saharan Africa (5.6%), or Latin America and the Caribbean (3.0%).2 Some recent \nestimates suggest that Asia will need $3 trillion over the next 10 years or about $300 billion \nannually.3 The  infrastructure  investment  requirements  exceed  the  available  public  financial \nresources, resulting in a funding backlog that varies from country to country but is present from \nthe poorest to the most developed nations. This poses a big challenge to Asian governments.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila \n2 World Bank website on infrastructure, updated March 2008 (available: http://go.worldbank.org/RSG3R6K6Q0). \n3  Nag, Rajat. 2007. Public Private Partnership for Infrastructure Development. Keynote Speech at the Asia-Pacific \nBusiness Forum. Seoul (4 October). \n ", "2   \n \n6.  There is universal acceptance that the private sector can play a larger role in the \nfinancing  of  infrastructure  in  partnership  with  the  public  sector  through  PPPs.  In  such \narrangements,  the  public  and  private  sectors  collaborate  to  combine  their  strengths  and \ncapabilities, and agree on a sensible allocation of risks between them, with risk assigned to the \npartner that is best able to manage it. The role of the private sector can be that of a project \nsponsor,  equity  or  institutional  bond  investor,  and/or  service  provider.  The  private  partner \ncontributes not only capital but also technology and management to deliver agreed outputs (not \ninputs). Governments are better assured of project completion on time and within budget, but, \nmore importantly, of quality operation and adequate maintenance of infrastructure facilities. \nHowever, the typical constraints to the participation of the private sector are (i) macro-level \ninvestment needs are not always translated into projects; (ii) bankable projects are often in short \nsupply; (iii) PPP transaction costs are large; and (iv) the absence of a transparent competitive \nprocurement process.  \n \n7.  Further, the ability of the project sponsor to leverage equity investments by accessing \nthe debt market depends to a large extent on the credit quality of the debt instruments and the \nrisk-sharing arrangements as well as some issues beyond the direct control of the project \nsponsors such as macro-economic stability and political commitment. The issues that affect \ncredit  quality  are  related  to  the  balance  between  the  public  perception  of  private  sector \ninvolvement, the need for sovereign control, and public access to infrastructure on the one hand, \nand the private investor rights and operational control, the expectations of reasonable rate of \nreturn  on  investment  commensurate  with  the  risks  and  other  competing  investment \nopportunities, and recourse available to mitigate risks on the other.  \n \n8.  Private  investors  nevertheless  played  an  important  part  in  meeting  the  growing \ninfrastructure demand in Asia\u2019s developing countries prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. \nNearly $150 billion in investments poured into countries like the Indonesia, Malaysia, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Philippines, and Republic of Korea. At its peak in the mid-1990s, \nprivate investment accounted for 20%\u201325% of total infrastructure investment in developing Asia, \nparticularly Southeast Asia. However, the Asian financial crisis interrupted this involvement.  \n \n9.  There is an increasing recognition and emphasis in the DMCs of the need to adopt PPP \napproaches  for  the  development  of  infrastructure.  While  experience  has  shown  that  PPP \napproaches in infrastructure and social service delivery enable governments to use private \nsector  efficiency  and  investments  to  improve  service  delivery  to  citizens,  many  DMCs \nexperienced difficulties in implementing PPP projects due to impulsive decisions to enter into an \nagreement  without  understanding  the  risks  involved.  Most  of  these  transactions  lack  the \nnecessary assessment of the policy environment, legal and regulatory framework, institutional \ncapacity, and the risk sharing involved in the agreement.   \n \n10.  Many  DMCs\u2014such  as  Cambodia,  Pakistan,  and  Viet  Nam\u2014are  in  the  process  of \nestablishing such an enabling framework, and varying levels of progress has been achieved in \ncountries such as India, PRC, Philippines, and Thailand. The governments, in partnership with \ndevelopment banks and international aid agencies, are discovering that it is possible to attract \nprivate investment in infrastructure by pooling project credit risks through infrastructure banks, \nand providing credit enhancement. There is recognition that stabilizing the revenue streams and \nestablishing recovery value of infrastructure assets opens the door for longer debt tenures, \ncorrecting an historic mismatch between the term of debt and the useful life of an investment \nasset. \n \n ", "  3\n11.  ADB works with governments to strengthen governance, build capacity, formulate reform \nagendas, and create conditions conducive to private investment. ADB also provides direct \nassistance for PPP projects and helps them achieve financial closure. ADB\u2019s engagement with \nthe commercial private sector in PPPs has mostly been in the leasing subsector, followed by the \nbanking  and  manufacturing  subsectors,  financial  services,  and  infrastructure  development. \nADB\u2019s interventions for facilitating PPPs has taken two forms: (i) promoting the development of \nan enabling environment supportive of growth of the private sector in areas such as the financial \nsector and trade sector reforms; and (ii) focusing on actively seeking PSP in areas where ADB\u2019s \nassessment  showed  that  there  had  already  been  significant  progress  towards  creating  an \nenabling  environment  for  private  sector  development  but  where  this  has  been  less  than \nsatisfactory.4   \n \n12.  In the medium term, ADB will be funding a number of interventions aimed at developing \nthe enabling environment for participation of private sector institutions in the agriculture, energy, \ntransport, and communications sectors. Similarly, ADB will work with public and private sector \ninstitutions to identify opportunities for greater private sector involvement in social services, both \nfor private sector involvement and in the form of partnerships with the public sector. \n \n13.  The Republic of Korea enacted the Private Capital Inducement Act in 1994, which \nattracted limited attention from the private sector because of lack of institutional and regulatory \nreform. After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the Government amended the act in 1999, including \nchanging its title to the Act on Private Participation in Infrastructure. It addressed the institutional \nand regulatory reforms by stating the sectors that were open to private investment and the \nmethods  of  promoting  private  investment  projects,  including  procedures  for  facilitating  the \nsmooth conduct of projects. Equally importantly, it complemented this with a well-defined and \ntransparent financial assistance and risk mitigation framework that lays down the applicable \nrules under different PPP options. The Private Capital Inducement Act increased the private \nshare in government infrastructure investment in the Republic of Korea from less than 4% in \n1998 to more than 17% in 2006. It has the experience of implementing it successfully for almost \na decade. Hence it provides a very good learning experience that is of significance to most of \nthe DMCs and merits wider dissemination. \n \n14.  The RETA intends to provide an in-depth assessment of the different components of the \nRepublic of Korea PPP framework, with case studies including comparing and contrasting the \nsuccess  factors  of  the  Korean  model  with  the  experience  of  other  DMCs  through  invited \npresentations on PPP frameworks, and multisector case studies.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the RETA will be to enhance private sector investments in infrastructure \nprojects through PPP approaches. \n \n16.  The outcome of the RETA will be to enhance the institutional and professional capacity \nin knowledge of PPP frameworks and experience among policy makers by (i) disseminating \nfeatures of successful PPP guidelines and/or legal, institutional, and financial frameworks; and \n(ii) successful application of such enabling frameworks to the development of infrastructure \n                                                 \n4 Shah, M.A. 2004.

Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The  RETA  adopts  a  two-pronged  approach  to  achieving  the  proposed  impact  and \noutcome: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Conduct a study that (a) brings out the salient features of the PPP \npolicy and the legal, institutional, and financial framework in the Republic of \nKorea; (b) captures the successful experience in two representative infrastructure \nPPP projects that were developed under this framework; and (c) compares and \ncontrasts the success factors of the Korean model with the experience of 4\u20135 \nother DMCs, such as the PRC, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, to bring \nout similarities and differences, including pitfalls. \n \n(ii)  Component  2:  Organize  a  workshop  for  policy  makers  from  DMCs  that  (a) \ndisseminates the findings of the study, and (b) provides a platform to share \nsimilar  successful  experiences  of  both  PPP  frameworks  and  infrastructure \nprojects in other DMCs.5 \n \n18.  Component 1: Study. The Government developed a framework in 1999 for attracting \nprivate investments in infrastructure through a PPP approach. It addresses the development of \n44  types  of  infrastructure  facilities  in  15  multisector  categories  covering  sectors  such  as \ntransport (roads, railways, ports, and airports), logistics, energy, communications, environment, \nforestry, water resources, and social subsectors (education, culture and tourism, welfare, and \nhousing). While all the subsectors have examples of successfully developed PPP projects, \nsubsectors like roads, ports, railways, environment, and schools have larger numbers of such \nprojects. Two of the above-mentioned infrastructure sectors will be selected in the RETA, \ndepending on available information on successful projects that have noteworthy and useful \nexperience to share. The Korean framework has resulted in attracting increasing investments \nthrough PSP with remarkable success: \n \n(i)  Under build-transfer-operate and its variants (including variants such as build-\nown-transfer  and  build-own-operate  options)  143  projects  in  infrastructure \nsectors have attracted investment of W42.1 trillion (approximately $42.8 billion) \nwith roads, ports, and railways accounting for 73% of the projects. \n(ii)  Under  build-transfer-lease,  227  projects  have  attracted  investment  of  W12.1 \ntrillion (approximately $12.3 billion) with schools and the environment accounting \nfor 90% of the projects. \n(iii)  The share of private investment through PPP projects in overall infrastructure \ninvestment in the country has risen significantly\u2014in 2006, private investments of \nW3.2  trillion  (approximately  $3.26  billion)  were  17.4%  of  the  government \ninvestments  of  W18.4  trillion  (approximately  $17.8  billion).  The  1998  private \n                                                 \n5  Budget constraints pose limitations on making this a more comprehensive project that covers other DMCs in \ngreater detail. Hence, the attempt is to undertake wider dissemination of the comprehensive successful Korean \nexperience of more than a decade, and through the workshop, also share the successful experiences in other \nDMCs. \n ", "  5\ninvestments  figure  of  W0.5  trillion  ($0.5  billion)  is  3.9%  of  the  government \ninvestments of W12.7 trillion (approximately $12.3 billion).6 \n \n19.  The unique knowledge sharing opportunity lies in the following aspects: \n \n(i)  The  Republic  of  Korea  has  broad  and  successful  experience  involving  (a) \ndeveloping  a  PPP  framework;  (b)  embedding  financial  assistance  through \nlegislation with clear and transparent conditions to be met; and (c) successfully \nattracting  significant  interest  from  private  organizations  for  multisector \ninvestments including social infrastructure such as schools and cultural centers.  \n(ii)  The PPP framework covers in detail all aspects related to the procedures for \nexamination and treatment of solicited and unsolicited proposals.  \n(iii)  The  embedded  financial  support  and  incentives  include  creation  of  an \ninfrastructure fund to invest in joint companies to be set up with the private sector, \nallowing the infrastructure company to raise project finance through issuance of \ninfrastructure bonds with income tax benefits, provision of construction subsidies \nand loans, and provision of tax benefits. \n(iv)  Risk mitigation has been balanced during the project life cycle through certain \nfeatures such as creation of an infrastructure credit guarantee fund, provision of \nminimum  revenue  guarantee,  defining  provisions  for  termination  payments \nincluding buyout obligation by the Government under force majeure conditions, \nand protection against reduction of tariffs or concession period.  \n \n20.  The key success factors of the Korean model will be compared and contrasted with the \nexperience of 4\u20135 other DMCs, such as the PRC, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, to \nbring  out  similarities  and  differences,  including  pitfalls  that  may  have  emerged  from  the \nexperience of some countries.7 The Korean model will also be compared and contrasted with \nPPP models in Asian countries like Japan, Singapore and/or Hong Kong, China, and with the \nEuropean and Latin American approaches, to examine how this is more relevant for Asian \nDMCs (Appendix 4 has a brief summary on PPP frameworks in some countries). \n \n21.  Component  2:  Workshop.  In  recognition  of  the  fact  that  there  are  other  useful \nexperiences within Asian countries that are noteworthy for broadening learning, the RETA \nproposes to organize a workshop inviting policy makers from other DMCs, such as PRC, India, \nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand,  to  enable  sharing  of  the  multisector  and  multi-country \nexperiences relevant to infrastructure development through a PPP approach. While finalizing \nthe list of about 30 participants from different DMCs, the intention is to seek feedback from the \nregional departments of ADB. Some likely countries (in addition to those mentioned above) \ninclude Armenia, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. The proposed implementing agency for \nthis  RETA  would  be  responsible  for  organizing  this  workshop.  It  also  will  identify  such \nsuccessful PPP frameworks and case studies within Asia, and seek participation of the relevant \ncase-study presenters, with ADB\u2019s involvement.  \n \n22.  On reviewing the PPP learning resources within ADB that are being used for knowledge \nsharing within and outside of ADB, it is observed that the proposal will add to the knowledge \nbase in two specific areas: \n                                                 \n6  Presentation made by the director, Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) Division, Ministry of Planning and \nBudget,  Republic  of  Korea  in  an  Asia  Pacific  Ministerial  Conference  on  Public  Private  Partnerships  for \nInfrastructure Development (2007). \n7  The RETA will only require a simple collection of information or materials from available sources by KDI in various \nDMCs, so there is no need to obtain the confirmation of the no-objection from the governments for this activity.  \n ", "6   \n \n(i)  discussing a successful policy and legal framework that is complemented by a \nstructured  financial  assistance  framework  that  transparently  lays  down  the \nconditions for government assistance; and \n(ii)  sharing PPP experiences in sectors beyond energy and/or power (conventional, \nhydro, or gas), toll roads, water, and telecommunications that form the bulk of \nPPP project experiences. \n \n23.  The  ADB  Institute  (ADBI)  was  consulted  to  explore  possible  opportunities  for \ncollaboration in their flagship project on infrastructure and regional cooperation. ADB's Regional \nand Sustainable Development Department is already collaborating with ADBI on this RETA. The \nPPP case studies and findings of this RETA will be shared with ADBI for their flagship study \npublication in the chapter on financing infrastructure.  \n \n24.  The review of the PPP framework in the Republic of Korea is intended to be largely \nundertaken on the basis of the secondary data and published sources, along with a discussion \nwith  the  relevant  government  agencies,  representative  private  sector  organizations, \nrepresentative institutions, representative beneficiaries, and other industry or citizen groups. \nThe two case studies in the Republic of Korea will be developed on the basis of interactions with \nthe  relevant  government  agencies,  the  project  implementing  agency  and/or  private  sector \npartners, representative institutions, beneficiaries and other industry or citizen groups. The PPP \nframeworks  and  case  studies  in  other  DMCs  will  be  examined  and  suitable \npersons/organizations will be identified for presenting the experience. Both will be presented \nthrough  a  workshop  inviting  participants  from  among  the  policy  makers  in  the  DMCs. \nDocumentation  of  the  above  will  be  disseminated  through  electronic  and  print  media  and \nthrough an internal seminar for interested ADB staff.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n25.  The total cost of the RETA is $620,000, $500,000 of which is proposed to be financed on \na grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, administered \nby ADB. The remaining $120,000 will be cofinanced by the Korea Development Institute (KDI) \non a parallel basis. The amount will cover the administrative and support costs. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The Executing Agency for the RETA will be ADB\u2019s Energy, Water and Transport Division \nwhich will directly guide and monitor the RETA. KDI is proposed as the implementing agency for \nthis RETA for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  It is an autonomous, policy-oriented research organization established by the \nGovernment as an economic think tank on the various economic policy issues, \nand provides expert analysis and advice on all aspects of long- and short-term \ngovernment policies. Its involvement in the context of sharing the experience of \nthe Republic of Korea will therefore bring the institutional learning that may be \ndifficult for other international consulting organizations to provide. \n(ii)  It has significant experience with PPPs. In particular, KDI has been providing \nsupport to the Government on the system and methodology related to the review \nand  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  the  concession  agreements  for  private \n ", "  7\ninvestment projects in PPP projects. Its work also includes private investment \nprojects-related  guidelines  and  legal  documents,  and  on  the  improvement \nmeasures  for  the  private  investment  project  system.  It  has  developed  a \nsignificant database that can be useful for this RETA.   \n(iii)  It has been the nodal agency in the Republic of Korea engaged in capacity \ndevelopment and dissemination of knowledge related to PPPs. It has organized \nmany  workshops,  conferences,  and  seminars  and  has  contacts  with  many \norganizations and professionals in other DMCs in this respect. Since it is a \nresearch  organization,  it  facilitates  others  to  readily  share  information  and \nexperiences compared to a commercial organization undertaking the same task. \nHence with ADB involvement, KDI is well placed to address the needs of bringing \nin the participatory sharing of experiences from other countries to the workshop. \n(iv)  It has indicated a willingness to cofinance the RETA on a parallel basis.  \n \n27.  Considering the nature of the RETA and the funding being sought under the Republic of \nKorea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, KDI is considered knowledgeable and well-\nplaced to implement the proposed RETA. The program of activities to be undertaken in the \nRETA is given in Appendix 3. ADB will enter into a technical assistance collaboration agreement \nwith KDI, which will specify the arrangements for implementation of the RETA by KDI and for \ndisbursement of funds to KDI by ADB.   \n \n28.  Part of the services to be provided by KDI is to interact with the project stakeholders in \nthe Republic of Korea. This includes consultations with (apart from the Republic of Korea \ngovernment agencies) the private sector partners implementing the case study PPP projects, \nrepresentative institutions, representative beneficiaries, and other industry or citizen groups in \nthe Republic of Korea. KDI, along with ADB, will also interact with organizations in other DMCs \nfor sharing of PPP experiences in different sectors through the workshop. \n \n29.  After completion of the RETA, it is expected that there will be continuing need for: \n(i)  creating innovative risk mitigation instruments and funds in ADB that can be \noffered to DMCs for incorporation and strengthening their respective PPP project \ndevelopment policy frameworks;  \n(ii)  assisting the regional departments in ADB to implement Strategy 2020 by (a) \nproviding services to the DMCs to develop and strengthen the individual country \nPPP framework, (b) strategically working with the DMCs to identify investment \nneeds  in  infrastructure  using  the  PPP  approach,  and  (c)  undertaking  the \ndevelopment of such PPP projects for the DMCs under TA projects; and \n(iii)  providing training and disseminating PPP experience to DMCs in Asia. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n30.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB-\nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  for  the \nKnowledge Sharing on Infrastructure Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Asia, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nEnhanced private  Significant  Infrastructure investment  \u2022  Appropriate PPP policy \nsector investments in  improvement in  reports from the DMCs  and guidelines are \ninfrastructure projects  leveraging public funds  instituted in the DMCs \nthrough PPP  to attract private sector   \napproaches  investments in \n  infrastructure projects \nthrough PPP \napproaches \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced institutional  Significant  Reports from DMCs on the  \u2022  Resources to develop \nand professional  improvement in DMCs'  number of PPP projects  and implement \ncapacity of DMCs in  effectiveness in  and related investment  infrastructure projects \nPPP frameworks and  designing appropriate  data  are available \nexperience   enabling PPP  \u2022  Sustained environment \n  frameworks and  for PPP projects is \ndeveloping  created, requiring \ninfrastructure projects  cooperation and \nthrough the PPP  collaboration among \napproach  government \norganizations and \nprivate companies \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The Korea Development Institute (KDI) will undertake the required detailed tasks, not \nlimited to but broadly outlined hereunder, so as to address the program of activities envisaged in \nthe regional technical assistance (RETA) project. \n \n(i)  Review literature and secondary sources on the Republic of Korea\u2019s Private \nParticipation Initiative Act, rules, regulations, annual (basic) plans, guidelines, \nand amendments related to public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and bring out the \nsalient  features  related  to  encouragement  for  development  of  PPP  projects, \nstipulated procurement options, provisions for nonfinancial government support, \nconditions to access financial assistance from the Government, and institutional \nand  contractual  frameworks  for  investment,  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of the project.   \n(ii)  Hold discussions with the relevant government department in the Ministry of \nPlanning  and  Budget,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  KDI, \nrepresentative private sector partners, representative industry institutions and/or \nassociations, beneficiaries, and other industry or citizen groups to understand \nand document the development of PPPs in the country and their experience so \nfar. The feedback also needs to be compared and contrasted with the experience \nof other countries having experience in PPPs to bring out the relevance of the \nRepublic of Korea PPP model in the Asia and Pacific region context. Typical \nquestions (but not limited to these) to be answered would be: \n \n(a)  How have the PPP approaches contributed to scaling-up infrastructure \nservices in the country? What has the experience been in the Republic of \nKorea  of  PPPs  in  subsectors  that  impact  poor  customers?  What \ndifficulties were faced with PPPs at the very beginning in the Republic of \nKorea? Who resisted and how were these participants included? How \nwas knowledge shared within the Republic of Korea to develop the PPP \nprogress it has today? \n(b)  Discuss why the Korean experience is a useful model (over, say, Japan \nwhich is similar, or Singapore and/or Hong Kong, China which have less \nexperience)  and  compare  it  with  the  Europe  and  Latin  American \napproaches to examine how this is more relevant for Asian developing \nmember countries (DMCs). \n(c)  Is  the  Korean  success  a  real  success  in  terms  of  social  welfare \nimprovement? \n \n(iii)  Review literature and secondary sources to capture the PPP project experience \nof the Republic of Korea by way of the type (PPP option), sector and number of \nprojects developed using the PPP framework, and the investments by the private \nsector in such PPP projects. Typical questions (but not limited to these) to be \nanswered would be: \n \n(a)  What infrastructure and services were found suitable for using private \nsector participation (PSP) modalities? (i) water, sewerage and sanitation; \n(ii)  solid-waste  collection  and  disposal;  (iii)  transport  including  roads, \nbuses, rapid transit systems, airports, and ports; (iv) housing; (v) tourism \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \ndevelopment; (vi) power plants; and/or (vii) others? What specific factors \nmake it advantageous to use PSP in each of these areas?  \n(b)  What types of PPP and/or PSP modalities are usually used for financing \nurban  infrastructures  and  services?  (i)  build-transfer-lease  and  build-\ntransfer-operate contracts and its variants such as build-operate-transfer \nand build-own-operate, (ii) concessions, and/or (iii) others? \n(c)  Conduct  an  in-depth  analysis  to  asses  why  PPPs  have  become \nsuccessful in the Republic of Korea, giving adequate attention to the \nmaturity  of  financial  and  other  markets,  governance,  law  and  order, \ncontract enforcement, institutional capacity, demand and willingness to \npay for infrastructure facilities, and location-specific and cultural factors.   \n \n(iv)  Review  literature  and  secondary  sources  to  compare  and  contrast  the  key \nsuccess factors of the Korean model with the experience of 4\u20135 other DMCs, \nsuch as the People's Republic of China (PRC), India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and \nThailand, to bring out similarities and differences (including pitfalls) in the PPP \nframeworks, PPP project experience by way of type (PPP option), sector and \nnumber of projects developed using the PPP framework, and the investments by \nthe private sector in such PPP projects. Identify successful examples with ADB \nfor  possible  dissemination  in  DMCs.  This  will  include  contact  details  of  the \norganizations so that appropriate persons can be contacted for sharing their \nexperience in the workshop.   \n(v)  Prepare working note no. 1 on tasks (i)\u2013(iv) and circulate to ADB for comments \nwith appropriate presentation material. \n(vi)  Short-list  representative  projects  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  from  different \nsectors  (seaports,  railways,  waste-water  management,  culture  and  tourism, \nenvironment, and education) and select at least two representative projects in \nconsultation with ADB as case studies for further analysis so as to cover different \nPPP options like build-transfer-lease, build-transfer-operate, build-own-transfer, \nbuild-operate-own, or variants. \n(vii)  Hold discussions with the project sponsor and/or developer in order to broadly \nunderstand  the  various  steps  used  in  developing  the  project  (project \ndevelopment cycle). The typical steps to be examined for identification of the \nproject and PSP partners would be  \n \n(a)  the need for the project and demand for services; \n(b)  a preliminary feasibility assessment (technical feasibility, broad sizing and \ncosting, environmental and social acceptability, financial feasibility, legal \nand institutional issues, and identification of risks); \n(c)  a detailed feasibility analysis (value for money test; analysis of options; \ndetailing of preferred project option; analysis of various issues related to \ntechnical,  environmental,  social,  financial,  and  legal  and  institutional \naspects); \n(d)  a risk analysis, including methods for mitigation; \n(e)  project structuring for PSP modality (bundling and/or unbundling project \ncomponents, project construction, operation and management, examining \nwhat  is  permissible  within  the  legal  and/or  administrative  context, \nexamining what will be acceptable politically and socially, and indicating \nhow the project can be brought to a bankable stage); \n(f)  identification of financing options (where can PSP partners access capital \nand how can capital risks be reduced?); \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \n(g)  marketing of projects with potential private participants and/or investors to \nassess their concerns and to incorporate these before the project is bid \nout;  \n(h)  procedures adopted for bidding and/or procurement and awarding the \nproject; and  \n(i)  monitoring and evaluation instruments embedded in the project design to \nensure adequate feedback that can be used to make course corrections \nand mitigation measures. \n \n(viii)  Hold discussions with the representative industry institutions and/or associations, \nbeneficiaries and other industry or citizen groups regarding their perspective of \nthe selected PPP projects. \n(ix)  Examine  the  role  of  government  regulators  in  ensuring  that  consumers  are \nsatisfied and get value for money in PSP-provided infrastructure and services. \nTypical questions to be answered would be: \n \n(a)  How can the pricing of services be regulated to ensure that benefits to \nconsumers are maximized? \n(b)  What  mechanisms  are  used  to  generate  consumer  feedback  so  that \nservice providers are able to respond to consumer demands?  \n \n(x)  Present an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the PPP approach \nadopted in the project in a form suitable for review and discussion with DMCs. \nComparisons  with  international  and  regional  experience  should  be  provided \nwhere relevant and useful. \n(xi)  Prepare working note no. 2 based on tasks (vi)\u2013(x) and circulate to KDI and ADB \nfor comments with appropriate presentation material. \n(xii)  Coordinate with identified organizations in other DMCs (step iv) for preparing and \npresenting  successful  PPP  frameworks  and  case  studies  on  successful \ninfrastructure PPP projects. \n(xiii)  Organize a workshop at ADB headquarters or KDI, Seoul for presenting the \noverall  PPP  experience  in  the  DMCs.  The  workshop  should  also  hold  a \ndiscussion on how the lessons shared can bring out alliances between Korean \nagencies and other DMC agencies, and how they can be sustained. KDI will be \nresponsible for the necessary administrative support for inviting DMC participants \nand  on-site  support  during  the  workshop.  The  material  for  presentation  and \ndistribution  to  the  participants  will  be  provided  by  KDI.  ADB  will  provide \nnecessary facilitation and administrative support if the workshop is organized in \nADB headquarters.  \n(xiv)  Based on working notes 1 and 2 and the workshop presentations and/or papers \non  PPP  experience  in  Asia,  prepare  a  draft  final  report  with  appropriate \npresentation material. \n(xv)  Incorporate feedback, if any, and prepare the final report. \n \n2.
