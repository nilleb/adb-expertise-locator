INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the multi-donor coordination meeting in April 2014, the Government of Viet Nam \nrequested support for improving the effectiveness in the preparation and implementation of \nofficial development assistance (ODA) in the country. The technical assistance (TA) will support \nthe professionalization of project management unit (PMU) staff in target provinces on a pilot \nbasis, and complement the government\u2019s action plan to improve performance of programs and \nprojects  under  ODA.  The  TA  will  help  provincial  level  PMU  staff  meet  the  performance \nstandards or core skills requirements for project management through on-the-job training and \ncapacity building activities.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted several discussions with the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment (MPI) from June 2014 to February 2015 to agree on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, cost estimates, draft terms of reference, implementation arrangements, and \nkey activities of the TA. \n \n3.  The TA concept paper was approved on 7 November 2014. The design and monitoring \nframework of the TA is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Development  projects  in  Viet  Nam  are  implemented  through  PMUs.  Improving  the \neffectiveness of these projects is hindered by the weak skills of PMU staff, particularly at the \nprovincial level. Many provincial level PMUs face difficulties in recruiting and retaining well-\nqualified and competent mid-level managers and technical specialists in the core functions of \nproject management (i.e., procurement, social and environmental safeguards, project financial \nmanagement, contract management, and monitoring and evaluation). Moreover, capacity built in \nPMUs normally dissipates when the project ends due to lack of institutional responsibility within \nPMUs to handle such core functions. Approaches and standards across development projects, \nespecially  those  covering  wide  geographical  areas  and  multiple  provinces,  tend  to  be \nfragmented, inefficient, and uneven. These weaknesses and challenges often affect project \nreadiness, and result in delays in project processing and approval. \n  \n5.  These  weaknesses  and  challenges  also  increase  the  risk  of  misprocurement  and \nnoncompliance with safeguards and financial management requirements of donors, impacting \nproject implementation and effectiveness. Additionally, inadequate analysis of gender issues \nand  gender  mainstreaming  measures  results  in  missed  opportunities  for  reducing  gender \ndisparities  and  supporting  the  empowerment  of  women.  Insufficient  involvement  and \nconsultation  with  key  stakeholders  also  limits  the  results,  relevance,  and  sustainability  of \nprojects.  \n \n6.  During project preparation, project-specific assessment of institutional capacity, policy \nenvironment, and risks related to procurement, contract management, financial management, \nsafeguards,  civil  society  participation,  and  gender  is  usually  insufficient  and  limited  to  the \nexecuting agency and central project unit. Provincial units that play a crucial role in project \nimplementation, including safeguards, procurement, and monitoring, are usually not sufficiently \ncovered  in  the  assessment.  Furthermore,  the  assessment  does  not  build  on  previous \n                                                \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 May 2015. \n ", "2  \nassessments since there is no mechanism to capture knowledge gained from completed and \nongoing projects. \n \n7.    The weak capacity of PMUs, particularly in disadvantaged provinces or those lagging \nbehind, requires urgent remedial measures, as it causes concern on the disbursement of ODA-\nfinanced projects and hinders public investment planning and implementation. These challenges \nmust be addressed by augmenting the provincial PMU staff basic project management skills \nusing available resources and by strengthening and maintaining the provincial PMU in-house \ncapacity through professionalization of the PMUs, which includes improving the regulatory and \ninstitutional environment, standardizing procedures, and developing staff capacity. \n \n8.  On 23 April 2013, the Prime Minister of Viet Nam issued Decree 38/2013/ND-CP on the \nManagement  and  Utilization  of  ODA  and  Concessional  Loans,  and  on  25  July  2014,  he \napproved the 2014\u20132015 action plan to improve the performance of ODA programs and projects. \nThe TA will complement the implementation of this action plan.2 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved effectiveness in preparing and implementing ODA-financed \nprojects in Viet Nam. The outcome will be improved professionalization of PMUs in the target \nsectors and provinces. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The main outputs of the TA are (i) project design and readiness of ODA-funded projects \nin  target  provinces  enhanced,  (ii)  provincial  level  PMU  institutional  arrangements  and \nprocedures on core project management functions in the target sectors and provinces improved, \n(iii) provincial level PMU staff skills on core project management functions developed and \nsustained, and (iv) knowledge on provincial level PMU professionalization assessments and \nexperience shared.  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  primarily  provide  (i)  field-based,  hands-on,  step-by-step  support  and \ncoaching to provincial level PMUs on project design and implementation; and (ii) training of \ntrainers  for  provinces  and  line  ministries  on  procurement,  financial  management,  contract \nmanagement, poverty assessment and social analysis, safeguards, and gender and stakeholder \nengagement. Within the overall framework of the Government of Viet Nam action plan for \nimproving performance of ODA programs and projects (footnote 2), the TA will help (i) improve \nthe systems, structures, procedures, and staff skills on core project management functions in \nparticipating poor and weak provinces; (ii) pilot a mechanism for developing a certification \nsystem for PMU staff on specific core management skills; and (iii) disseminate lessons to other \nprovinces. External experts will be engaged to work closely with provincial level PMUs to ensure \ntimely and quality project processing and administration. The TA team may participate in the \nreview and fact-finding missions (or initiate separate field visits) to assist in due diligence \nreviews and analyses. Such reviews will be used to troubleshoot and advise PMUs to address \nbottlenecks  and  emerging  issues  that  affect  project  preparation  and  management.  These \n                                                \n2  Prime Minister Decision 1257/QD-TTg approving the action plan of the Government of Viet Nam for improving \nperformance of ODA programs, projects, and concessional loans during 2014\u20132015. \n ", "  3\nexperts  will  also  help  conduct  capacity  assessments  and  diagnostic  analyses  to  propose \nguidelines and procedures on PMU professionalization. \n \n12.  The TA will carry out document and field-based reviews of provincial level PMU capacity \nin ODA-financed projects to (i) assess PMU staff skills and knowledge; and (ii) identify common \nimplementation concerns, safeguards compliance status, key areas for improvement, practices, \nand short to long-term human resources needs. Results of the reviews will be summarized in a \ndiagnostic  report,  including  practical  recommendations  for  provincial  level  PMU  capacity \nbuilding and improvements in project preparation and implementation procedures, staffing, and \ninstitutional set-up. Action plans for medium-term institutional and human resource development \nto support PMU professionalization in the target provinces will be developed. Provinces in \nregions that are lagging behind in ongoing and pipeline ODA-financed projects (i.e., northern \nmountains, central highlands, and coastal areas) will be targeted. The same provinces will be \ntargeted for all the TA outputs to ensure that support is provided in an integrated manner based \non detailed and clear selection criteria to be developed at the start of the TA. \n \n13.  Based on an assessment of provincial level PMU staff skills, the TA team will develop (i) \ntraining modules, draft and print supplementary guidance notes, and templates; and (ii) the work \nplan for targeted selection, coaching, and training of trainers for provincial level PMUs. A system \nfor  certification  will  also  be  explored  and  piloted  for  specific  subject  areas  following  the \ngovernment\u2019s  action  plan  (footnote  2).  A  peer  or  technical  review  involving  development \npartners will be conducted to ensure that the modules and templates to be developed under the \nTA complement and do not contradict the various policies and requirements of each institution. \n \n14.  Knowledge generated from the project will be disseminated through workshops including \ndevelopment partners and stakeholders. Regional stakeholders\u2019 workshops will be conducted to \nshare the results of the diagnostic report and capacity development approach in the target \nprovinces. Regional workshops will also be conducted to share the results and lessons learned \nfrom the project. Web disclosure of tools, guidance notes, templates, and e-learning modules \nproduced under the TA and other relevant references produced under the Technical Assistance \nfor Enhancing Government Capacity for Effective Project Design and Management will also be \ndone.3 To the extent possible, knowledge materials for web disclosure will be made in both \nEnglish and Vietnamese to facilitate wider use in Viet Nam. Opportunities for integrating lessons \nfrom the TA into ADB operations and future projects will be explored. \n \n15.  The success of the TA relies on active participation of the sector agencies and provinces, \nparticularly with on-the-job coaching and training, in line with the government\u2019s goal of improving \neffectiveness in preparing and implementing ODA-assisted projects. The TA assumes that the \ngovernment  will  remain  committed  to  improve  capacity  and  institutional  set-up  on  project \nmanagement, particularly at the provincial level. The TA will help identify feasible options to \nensure the retention and application of project management knowledge and skills within PMUs \nin  the  long  term  (taking  staff  turnover  into  account)  through  developing  mechanisms  for \ncertifying PMU staff for specific skills, and linking with ongoing civil service reform activities and \npipeline ODA projects. \n \n                                                \n3 ADB.  2011.

The TA is estimated to cost $1,600,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide $100,000 in counterpart funds to finance miscellaneous administration and support \ncosts, including allowances for counterpart staff, contingencies, and in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The MPI will be the executing agency. A PMU will be set up under the MPI\u2019s Foreign \nEconomic Relations Department to manage day-to-day activities of the TA, with support from a \ngroup  of  international  and  national  consultants.  The  PMU  will  coordinate  with  the  target \nprovinces, which will assign focal persons from the provincial PMU to link with other relevant \nunits and staff at the province for the TA, and nominate staff to be trained under the TA based \non agreed selection criteria. The TA has a multi sector focus involving two or more ministries, \nseveral  provinces  and  cities,  and  other  key  stakeholders  (including  development  partners \nthrough the Six Banks Group).4   \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2017. It will \nengage  approximately  244  person-months  of  consulting  services  (15.5  person-months  of \ninternational consultants and 228.5 person-months of national consultants). Advance actions on \nconsultant recruitment will be done to facilitate TA implementation. The international consultants \nwill comprise a capacity development specialist, and an infrastructure and contracts specialist. \nThe national consultants will comprise a coordinator and institutional capacity development \nspecialist, environment and climate change specialists, social safeguards specialists, social \ndevelopment  and  gender  specialists,  infrastructure  and  contracts  specialists,  a  financial \nmanagement specialist, a stakeholder consultation specialist, a PMU professionalization and an \noutreach liaison specialist. Resource persons will be engaged to provide input on specific topics \nand review training modules and tool kits prepared under the TA. The surveys, training, and \nworkshops  will  be  administered  by  the  consultants.  Appendix  3  shows  the  draft  terms  of \nreference of the consultants to be engaged.  \n \n19.  Technical supervision on procurement, safeguards, social development and gender will \nbe provided by the staff of the ADB Viet Nam Resident Mission to the TA consultants to ensure \nthe quality  of TA  outputs  and  alignment  with  ADB  policies.  A  regional  coordinator for TA \nactivities (initially targeting the northern mountain provinces and the central highlands) will also \nbe designated from the TA consultant team to consolidate outputs from the TA thematic experts \nand explore possibilities for interprovincial regional coordination. A similar regional coordinator \nwill be designated from among the staff of ADB and the resident mission to provide information \non regional issues and developments, as well as review and provide advice on the TA activities \nin the region.  \n \n20.  All experts shall be recruited by ADB through the individual consultant selection method \nand they will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nIndividual consultant recruitment is preferred to ensure better selection of the required diverse \nspecializations, which may not all be available in a single firm.

Administrative  assistants  and \ninterpreters, with a total input of 60 person-months, will be recruited to support the consultant \nteam. Procurement using TA proceeds will include shopping for workshop, seminar, and printing \nservices, and will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  The TA activities and outputs will be monitored and evaluated during the midterm and \nfinal review missions. TA implementation progress will be reviewed quarterly through meetings \nwith key partners and development partners (particularly from the Six Banks Group). Results \nfrom the semiannual surveys and focus discussions with the targeted provincial level PMUs by \nthe consulting team will also be used to obtain feedback on the TA progress. TA outputs will be \nshared with the Six Banks Group for necessary joint action. \n \n22.  Good practices and lessons learned will be disseminated through a stakeholders\u2019 forum \nto be organized following the midterm and final review missions. Brochures will be developed \nand disseminated to present key lessons and case studies. Case studies and lessons will also \nbe uploaded to the ADB website for public disclosure. Outreach and orientation sessions will be \norganized with other provinces for possible replication. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Capacity Building for Project Management Unit Professionalization, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved effectiveness in  Total ODA  MPI, MOF, sector  Other provinces in \npreparing and implementing  disbursements to Viet  ministries and  Viet Nam will adopt \nODA-financed projects in Viet  Nam increase from  provinces annual  recommended \nNam  $13.8 billion during  reports   institutional \n2006\u20132010 to $18 billion  improvements  \nduring 2015\u20132020 with a \ndisbursement ratio \nmaintained at 20%\u201325% \n   \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nImproved professionalization  At least 10 provincial  Sector ministries  The government is \nof provincial level PMUs in the  level PMUs in the target  and provinces  committed to \ntarget sectors and provinces  sectors and provinces  reports  improve capacity \nhave improved systems    and institutional set-\nand procedures on core  Consultants\u2019  up on project \nproject management  progress reports  management, \nfunctions by May 2018    particularly at the \n    provincial level \nAt least 80% of targeted  Semiannual   \nprovincial level PMU  feedback surveys of  Risk \nstaff trained and  trained and assisted  High staff turnover \ncoached able to meet  provincial level   \ncore project  PMUs    \nmanagement \nperformance standards \nby May 2018  \nOutputs      Assumption \n \n1.
