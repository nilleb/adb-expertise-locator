South Asia1 is one of the fastest growing regions in the world, but it also remains the \nleast integrated region in the world. This presents both challenges and opportunities. It has \nbeen proposed, in various venues, that ADB enhance its knowledge bank role in South Asia. In \nthis  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA),  we  focus  on  the  potential  role  that  two  key \nmembers\u2014India and Pakistan\u2014could play in promoting regional cooperation, while considering \nways and means of engaging other regional partners in the process.  \n \n2.  This study has adopted a country focus for several reasons. First, many of the policy and \ninstitutional prerequisites for and obstacles to regional cooperation in South Asia will require \nsubstantial reforms at the national level. A host of domestic issues and challenges identified in \ncountry strategy papers, particularly at the sectoral level, are linked to regional cooperation and \nintegration (RCI). Many of these issues are likewise identified in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (RCSP) for South Asia (2006\u20132008). \nSecond, it is widely acknowledged that the pace, direction, and extent of regional cooperation in \nSouth Asia are largely influenced by the actions of India and Pakistan, the region\u2019s two largest \neconomies\u2014hence the focus on these countries. Both countries have been taking steps to \npromote increased RCI, but there is a need to support this agenda by identifying domestic \nreforms that would support and accelerate the process. Finally, a country focus is warranted \ndue to the absence of any external catalyst promoting RCI. For example, in Southeast Asia the \nAsian  financial crisis  and  the  emergence  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  as  an \neconomic powerhouse galvanized the process of regional integration. In South Asia, the catalyst \nfor  increased  interregional  cooperation  and  integration2 (ICI)  has  so  far  been  generated \ninternally\u2014led by India and Pakistan\u2014rather than externally. South Asian RCI may receive an \nindirect boost as India and Pakistan pursue greater trade and investment links with East Asia \nand Southeast Asia through increased triangular trade and investment. The process of intra-\nregional  production  network\u2013based  specialization,  which  underlies  regional  integration  and \ndrove the process of increasing regional cooperation in Southeast Asia, could also occur in \nSouth Asia through ICI. However, the extent to which country-led ICI initiatives could be used as \na catalyst will be constrained by domestic policy choices and reform measures; this further \nunderscores the importance of adopting a country focus.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Much has been said and written about the challenge of pursuing RCI in South Asia. \nDespite significant benefits that could be gained from increased cooperation in the region,3 \nprogress has been painstakingly slow, and South Asia remains the least integrated region in the \nworld.4 For instance, intra-regional trade accounts for a mere 2% of gross domestic product, \ncompared to 20% in East Asia. Similarly, intra-regional exports have hovered around 5%, while \n                                                 \n1 For purposes of this RETA, South Asia would include the following countries:  Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nIndia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  \n2 Interregional cooperation and integration refers to initiatives involving South Asia and other regional groupings such \nas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the European \nUnion. \n3 For instance, the World Bank estimates that regional transport agreements covering roads, rail, air, and shipping \ncould lead to a twofold increase in trade within the region. http://go.worldbank.org/5OBGI14XS0. \n4 ADB. 2006.

Various political and economic factors contribute to this situation, \nand the potential to address them through policy change varies. \n \n4.  Nationally, obstacles to regional cooperation stem in part from the need to address \nlongstanding  development  challenges\u2014such  as  persistent  poverty,  rising  inequality,  and \ncontinued civil conflict\u2014which have necessarily taken precedence over regional concerns. In \naddition,  many  of  the  domestic  policies,  institutions,  and  capabilities  required  to  pursue \nsuccessful  regional  cooperation  are  either  missing  or  inadequate,  as  many  South  Asian \ncountries only recently began liberalizing their economies (in the late 1980s or early 1990s).  \n \n5.  Political exigencies and relations between South Asian countries have inhibited greater \neconomic cooperation in the region since it remains caught up with historical factors. As a result, \ngeopolitical and security issues continue to drive the regional policy landscape, thus weakening \nany  economic  initiative  for  cooperation.  Countries  in  South  Asia  have  similar  resource \nendowments,  meaning  trade  within  the  region  has  been  generally  competitive  rather  than \ncomplementary. Not surprisingly, trade liberalization within the region\u2014an initiative which could \nhave paved the way for cooperation in areas such as regional public goods\u2014has failed to \ndemonstrate sufficient economic gains. Even recent initiatives such as the establishment of the \nSouth Asian Free Trade Area have given little cause for optimism, as levels of protection within \nthe region remain higher than the rest of the world.5 Although Pakistan has steadily expanded \nthe list of goods that may be legally imported from India (from 40 in 1983, to 687 in 2004\u20132005, \nand 768 items in 2006), the fact that comprehensive most-favored nation treatment is denied a \nfellow member of the World Trade Organization and regional partner in the South Asian Free \nTrade  Area  is  startling.  As  a  result,  informal  trade  between  India  and  Pakistan  has  been \nconsiderable\u2014conservative estimates place the amount at around $550 million6\u2014resulting in \nmassive transaction costs and unnecessary inefficiencies. \n \n6.  External  pressures  could  have  led  to  increased  economic  cooperation,  but  such \npressures have also been absent. As noted above, in Southeast Asia, the Asian financial crisis \nand the PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth helped galvanize cooperation in the region. South Asia \nlacks a similar incentive stemming from a crisis or development, meaning the incentive for \nregional cooperation may have to be generated internally.   \n \n7.  However,  a  number  of  recent  developments  seem  to  indicate  that  some  of  these \ntraditional obstacles to regional cooperation may actually be easing.  \n \n8.  First, South Asian countries have progressively increased the level and pace of domestic \npolicy reforms, and appear to be achieving positive results. While poverty and inequality remain \nmajor challenges, considerable progress has been made in some areas, such as health and \neducation.  Significant  sector  reforms  and  increasing  attention  to  governance  issues  are \nredefining the economic landscape; sustaining these reforms will enable South Asian countries \nto take better advantage of emerging regional cooperation opportunities.  \n \n9.  Second, relations between South Asian countries, particularly India and Pakistan, have \nimproved in recent years. This RETA is designed to support and build upon this momentum. \n                                                 \n5 Chandra, Ramesh and Rajiv Kumar. 2007.

That is how my forefathers lived. That is how I want our grandchildren to \nlive.\u201d \n \n10.  Third, in contrast to slow progress in RCI, South Asian countries have made significant \nadvances in opening their economies to other regions and the world. Sri Lanka was the first to \npursue wide-ranging reforms, especially in relation to its trade and investment regimes. Other \nSouth Asian countries have steadily pursued free market reforms and liberalized trade under the \nWTO framework. South Asian countries have also worked to improve their economic relations \nby engaging in several bilateral and interregional initiatives, particularly with East and Southeast \nAsia (Box 1).

Both countries and donors are examining global integration, and ICI in particular, as \napproaches for catalyzing regional cooperation in South Asia. The growing importance of ICI is \nacknowledged in ADB's Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2006\u20132008): South Asia \n(footnote 4). ICI has been identified as one of the six approaches to achieve the strategy\u2019s \nobjectives.  ADB  Technical  Assistance  for  Promoting  South  Asian  Regional  Economic \nCooperation9 also  highlighted  the  importance  of  ICI  and  supported  activities  to  strengthen \ncooperation between the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the Association for \nSoutheast Asian Nations, and other regional organizations.  \n \n12.  Historically, it is not uncommon for global integration to precede successful RCI.10 This \ntrend towards greater openness and globalization could therefore form the basis for greater RCI \nin South Asia, if it is accompanied by appropriate national reforms. Southeast Asia followed a \nsimilar path of building RCI through global integration 25 years ago, when external demand for \ngoods and the desire to access global markets drove domestic reforms, and ultimately paved \nthe way for greater RCI. Although domestic resource endowments were broadly similar and \ntherefore largely competitive, as is true in South Asia today, changes in production technology \nand reductions in trade costs have facilitated a finer level of cross-country specialization in the \nform of product fragmentation. Thus, with the right set of reforms and liberalization, similar \nresource endowments in South Asia need not constrain greater regional integration.  \n \n13.  The  foregoing  discussion  has  highlighted  the  importance  of  country  initiatives  in \npromoting RCI. Clearly, substantial reforms at the national level are needed to meet many policy \nand institutional prerequisites, and overcome many obstacles standing in the way of increased \nRCI in South Asia. This RETA will examine the potential role India and Pakistan could play in \ncatalyzing  greater  future  RCI,  and  consider  how  to  engage  other  regional  partners  in  the \nprocess.   \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004.

India and Pakistan have been initially selected for this RETA due to their dominance in \nSouth Asia\u2019s regional economy, which is likely to continue. It is widely acknowledged that the \npace, direction, and extent of RCI are largely influenced by actions taken by both countries. The \nfree trade agreements listed in Box 1 demonstrate that India and Pakistan have been the key \nregional players actively pursuing economic liberalization.  \n \n15.    India  and  Pakistan  could  potentially  play  a  pivotal  role  in  advancing  wider  Asian \nintegration, as well as catalyzing South Asian regional cooperation. Ensuring that these two \ncountries fulfill this role will be fundamental to achieving (i) long-term national goals that relate to \nRCI and international cooperation, as identified in India\u2019s Vision 2020 and Pakistan\u2019s Vision \n2030; and (ii) regional cooperation objectives of the South Asian Association for Regional \nCooperation and ADB.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The intended impact of this RETA is the implementation of long-term domestic policy \nreforms to promote greater RCI in South Asia. As an outcome of this RETA, India and Pakistan \npolicymakers will be informed of feasible domestic policy reforms and strategic measures to \nsupport this goal.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The  study  will  commence  with  a  literature  review  that  summarizes  work  already \ncompleted on related topics, to ensure that the RETA complements rather than duplicates the \nexisting knowledge base. The review would examine, for example, studies that have been \ncompleted from a domestic perspective11 as well as those taking a regional or interregional \nview.12 Apart from ensuring that the study adds value, the literature review will also form an \nimportant input to a \u201cSouth Asia 2030\u201d background and context issues paper, which will build on \nADB\u2019s existing RCI strategy, South Asia RCSP, and the outputs of previous TA projects (e.g., \nfootnote 9). \n \n18.    The literature review and background and context issues paper will be presented at a \npreparatory workshop to be held at ADB headquarters. Work on the \u201cIndia 2030\u201d study will \ncommence thereafter. The \u201cPakistan 2030\u201d study will be informed by the work on India. The \nstudies will be published in English; if necessary, the possibility of translating these into local \nlanguages will be explored. In addition, national workshops in participating countries and an \ninternational conference at ADB headquarters will be organized. To promote dialogues on policy \nissues related to regional cooperation, representation from both countries at the workshops and \nparticipation in the international conference will be encouraged. While the countries\u2019 top political \nand economic leadership will be the main audience, each country study is also expected to be \nof major interest to the domestic and international business community as well as international \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 Gupta, S.P. 2002.

More specifically, the country studies would:  \n \n(i)  Identify  long-term  domestic  challenges  or  constraints  that  are  likely  to \nhinder meaningful RCI. It will help understand what the economic, social, and \npolitical landscape of each country may look like in 2030, and determine how \nbilateral and regional relationships might evolve into the future. The sectors and \nissues that need to be examined would include, but not be limited to: domestic \ninfrastructure  gaps  and  bottlenecks;  human  capital  and  workforce  skills \nrequirements; and the general domestic business environment and investment \nclimate, especially policy relating to foreign direct investment. This work will build \nupon the various relevant TA projects that have already been completed by the \nconcerned regional departments.  \n(ii)  Map out the most efficient and beneficial way of timing and sequencing \ndomestic policy reforms to address long-term challenges and support RCI. \nSouth Asian countries have already started pursuing reforms that would put in \nplace some of the domestic policies, institutions, and capabilities required to \npursue successful RCI, but there is an urgent need to step up and expand the \nreform process. At the same time, there is a need to closely consider the timing, \nsequencing,  and  coordination  of  reforms,  as  these  will  have  implications  for \npolicy priorities, and on the choice and design of institution- and capacity-building \nstrategies.  \n(iii)  Identify  long-term,  strategic  measures  that  could  maximize  gains  from \ndomestic policy reforms. This strategic orientation is meant to increase the \nutility of the studies by providing a framework for incorporating reforms in national \ndevelopment plans. These studies are expected to inform the regular revision \nand updating of ADB\u2019s South Asia regional cooperation strategies, South Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation,  and  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation programs. \n \n20.  The methodology employed for the studies needs to be robust, utilizing an analytical \nframework that clearly sets out its assumptions, underlying theory, and data used, in a way that \nenables independent verification. At the country level it should take an economy-wide approach, \ndistinguishing  significant  sectors  with  sufficient  detail  to  ensure  that  interrelationships  are \nadequately captured. Use of this type of analytical framework will ensure projections of sectors \nand variables are consistent, both in an accounting sense as well as inter-temporally. The role \nof member countries in promoting RCI should be examined in a long-term, forward-looking \ncontext. \n \n21.  This framework could be employed to provide a baseline case, and should be flexible \nenough to accommodate different scenarios at the national, regional and global levels. The \nscenarios would be generated based on in-depth country and regional knowledge, and focus on \nissues relating to key policy challenges at the national and bilateral levels that would be relevant \nin enhancing regional cooperation. How policy can support ICI in catalyzing RCI would also \nneed to be considered. The scenarios could be analyzed as deviations from the baseline case, \nand be presented through quantitative answers to \u201cwhat if\u201d questions. An illustrative example of \nthis type of approach employing scenario analysis has been presented in an ADB Economics \nand Research Department Working Paper.13 \n \n                                                 \n13 Roland-Holst,  David.  2006.

Cost and Financing \n \n22.  The RETA will cost an estimated $750,000 and is to be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.14 A detailed cost breakdown and the \nproposed financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. Within ADB, the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration (OREI) will implement the RETA in collaboration with other concerned \ndepartments and offices. Any activity in a country would commence after ADB has received the \nno-objection to its inclusion in the RETA. \n \n24.  The RETA will require one international principal consultant for 14 person-months and \ntwo international economists for 3 person-months each. The RETA will also require 12 person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants\u2019  inputs  (two  consultants  for  6  months  each).  Six  resource \npersons will be engaged to participate in the workshops and conference as discussants. The \nterms of reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 4. \n \n25  ADB will recruit the international consultant and international economists through single \nsource selection of a firm, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The firm being considered for this RETA,  Centennial \nGroup, is uniquely qualified for the envisioned scope of work, given its growing expertise in the \nregion;  its  proven  track  record  in  conducting  detailed  forecasting  work  geared  towards \nanticipating  major  turning  points  in  economics  and  politics;  and  its  distinct  advantage  in \nproviding high-level policy and strategic advice as the sponsor of the Emerging Markets Forum, \na non-profit forum for policy discussions between public and private sectors.  \n \n26.  The  RETA  will  commence  in  August  2008  with  the  engagement  of  consultants. \nPreparation of the literature review and the \u201cSouth Asia 2030\u201d background and context issues \npaper will follow shortly after. In September 2008, a preparatory workshop will be held at ADB to \ndiscuss the results of the literature review and background and context issues paper, and \nfinalize the scope and methodology of the country studies. Work on the \u201cIndia 2030\u201d study will \nstart in October 2008, and a draft full report will be ready for the India national workshop by \nMarch 2009. The \u201cPakistan 2030\u201d study will be conducted from April to September 2009, and \nthe report is expected to be available by October 2009 (details on milestone dates can be found \nin Appendix 1).  \n \n27.
