Samoa\u2019s  Statement  of  Development  Strategy  (SDS)  2002\u20132004  continues  to  focus \nstrongly on macroeconomic stability, public sector reform, and economic growth through private \nsector development. These objectives are expected to be reaffirmed in Samoa\u2019s next SDS \n(2005\u20132007).  Improvement  in  the  performance  and  management  of  Samoa\u2019s  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) has been a specific priority of the Government of Samoa (the Government) \nthroughout its reform processes, supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). ADB\u2019s \nprogram in Samoa1 focuses on the twin objectives of (i) improving the environment for the \nprivate sector; and (ii) ensuring access to, and quality of, basic social services.   \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  Strengthening  State-Owned  Enterprise  Corporate \nGovernance2 was agreed upon by ADB and the Government during programming discussions in \n2003 and was listed in the Samoa Country Strategy and Program Update 2004\u20132006. It follows \non from an earlier ADB TA project on the policy and government supervision aspects of SOE \nreform,3  which  has  successfully  (i)  updated  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  SOE \noperations, covering financial and community service objectives; (ii) supported the Samoan \nGovernment\u2019s adoption of a clear policy framework on SOE ownership or divestment; and (iii) \nstrengthened systems and capacity within the State-Owned Enterprises Monitoring Division of \nthe Ministry of Finance (SOEMD) to monitor SOE performance on behalf of the Government, as \nshareholder. The TA will complement a small-scale ADB TA on Privatization Support,4 which is \nsupporting Samoan government privatization of four commercial SOEs in accordance with the \nnew government SOE policy. Appendix 1 gives the project framework. \n \n3.  An ADB fact-finding mission5 visited Samoa 20\u201324 September 2004 for discussions with \nthe Government, SOE chairpersons, and directors and other stakeholders on the proposed TA. \nThe feasibility of the proposed project was agreed upon during the mission.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Samoa\u2019s 24 SOEs under 100% government ownership6 had total assets of about ST1.1 \nbillion. Their revenues equaled 37% of a GDP of ST898 million in 2002\u201303. Thus, SOE boards \nplay  a  significant  role  in  stewarding  Samoa\u2019s  economy.7  Many  of  the  SOEs  also  provide \nessential community services. Under the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act \n(2001), directors and chairpersons play an increasingly important role in efforts of the Samoan \nGovernment to improve SOE performance in delivery of both financial and community services. \nProfessional development of directors is, therefore, an important issue. The Government, as a \nshareholder, has a significant interest in promoting good SOE corporate governance. \n \n                                                 \n1  Set out in ADB. 2004. Samoa Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006). Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 2 November 2004.  \n3  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  Implementation  of  State-Owned \nEnterprise Reforms. Manila.  \n4  ADB. 2004. Small Scale Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Privatization Support. Manila. \n5  The mission consisted of Bill Costello, policy and regional cooperation specialist, ADB Pacific Department (mission \nleader); and  a staff consultant.  \n6  The Government disposed of three minority shareholdings during 2003. In one other case, the sale has not yet \nbeen made, but is being pursued. Privatization of 7 of the 24 wholly owned SOEs has also been agreed upon as \ngovernment policy and will be undertaken through a phased approach. \n7  The 24 SOEs under the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act are governed by 151 individuals in \n235 board positions. They include 129 private sector or community representatives, 16 public servants in 41 \npositions, and 9 ministers holding 19 chairs.  \n ", "2  \n5.  In broad terms, the elements of good corporate governance8 comprise (i) an effective \nlegal and regulatory environment; (ii) appropriate board processes and composition; (iii) skilled \nand ethical directors; and (iv) effective relations within the board and between the board and \nmanagement. The Public Bodies Act provides a solid legal and regulatory basis for continuous \nimprovement in SOE corporate governance, although some provisions of the Act, such as those \nrelating to an independent appointments committee, have not yet been fully implemented. Full \nimplementation will require proactive action by officials and support of ministers. Enactment and \nimplementation of the pending Companies Act, to which SOEs are subject, along with the Public \nBodies Act, would further strengthen the essentially sound legal and regulatory framework for \ngood corporate governance in Samoa\u2019s SOEs.  \n \n6.  Positive  momentum  is  apparent  in  current  SOE  board  and  director  performance. \nEnthusiasm for, and commitment to, the objective of strengthening SOE corporate governance \nis widespread. Many stakeholders are thinking actively about corporate governance issues, \nespecially following a highly successful corporate governance summit in 2003. Knowledge is \ngrowing about the roles and responsibilities of directors under the Public Bodies Act.  \n \n7.  Simultaneously, there is room for further improvement in director knowledge, skills, and \nattributes;  and  in  board  operations.  SOE  directors  highlight  a  number  of  structural  and \nprocedural issues that require further reform. These include a lack of focus on specific skill and \nattribute  requirements  during  the  appointment  process,  reducing  the  number  of  director \npositions on some boards, aligning director remuneration to responsibilities, and replacing ex-\nofficio appointees.9 Of concern to all stakeholders is that if the Government is to succeed with its \nobjective of replacing ministers and public servants as ex-officio board members, it is essential \nto have a pool of competent directors available to replace them.  \n \n8.  Improved corporate governance in SOEs will also likely have a positive flow-on effect to \nthe private sector. Most private companies in Samoa are family-owned. Few currently operate \nfull  corporate  governance  structures.  There  is  considerable  scope  for  private  sector \nrepresentatives to take good practices in SOE board operations back to their own companies.  \n \n9.  A number of institutional options were considered to meet the need for professional \ndevelopment  for  SOE  directors  and  to  promote  improved  board  operations.  Existing \norganizations  were  considered,  along  with  the  creation  of  a  new  organization.  A  specific \napproach to strengthening the director performance element of SOE corporate governance is \nthe establishment of an Institute of Directors10 (the Institute) as a professional development \nbody for directors of both SOE and private sector company boards. This proposal has been \nconsidered in both the public and private sectors in Samoa for some time. It has widespread in-\nprinciple support. The Government and other stakeholders agree that a separate organization, \n                                                 \n8 The International Finance Corporation (2003) defines corporate governance as \"the structures and processes for \nthe direction and control of companies. Corporate governance concerns the relationships among the management, \nthe Board of Directors, the shareholders and other stakeholders. Good corporate governance contributes to \nsustainable economic development by enhancing the performance of companies and increasing their access to \noutside capital.\"  \n9  Ex-officio appointees sit on boards as a consequence of their official positions (usually in government) rather than \nas individual citizens. These appointees usually bring high-level personal skills and significant knowledge and \ncorporate memory to their duties. But problems can also arise. One problem is that directors should clearly concern \nthemselves with the best interests of the company rather than that of another body, so motivations can become \nunclear.  Conflicts  of  interest  can  emerge  in  these  circumstances.  Also,  ex-officio  appointees  are  generally \nextremely busy people who are not always available for board meetings, so they send representatives. This \nundermines continuity and internal working relations within the board.  \n10 The Institute of Directors is a working title for the organization, and is subject to further consideration. \n ", "  3\nspecifically focused on professional development for directors in both public and private sector \ncompanies, would best advance the objective of improving director performance. Interest and \nmomentum are sufficient to suggest that advancing this proposal within a relatively short time \nframe is feasible.  \n \n10.  Financial sustainability will be a challenge for an independent Institute. But the financial \nsustainability of similar organizations (the Society of Accountants, the Chamber of Commerce, \nboth  with  about  150  members,  and  both  financially  sustainable)  indicates  that  financial \nsustainability is feasible, with prudent management.  \n \n11.  The  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  for  finance,  through  SOEMD,  has  significant \nresponsibilities for monitoring compliance with the Public Bodies Act, and also a mandate to \nactively promote best practices in SOE performance through improved corporate governance.  \nBesides its monitoring and reporting responsibilities to the Government, SOEMD should provide \nregular and constructive feedback to SOEs on performance and reporting issues. SOEMD \nshould also advise on appointment of directors, and play a constructive role in facilitating the \nresolution of the board structure and composition issues highlighted in paragraph 7. However, \nSOEMD has experienced considerable difficulty in meeting its responsibilities because of limited \nstaff numbers and experience. Despite impressive progress made by SOEMD staff, with ADB \nTA support, SOEMD requires additional staff and further capacity development.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  improved  SOE  contributions  to  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment in Samoa. Its purpose is the creation of a conducive environment for sound \ncorporate governance of 24 Samoan SOEs.11 The TA will have three outputs: \n   1)  the Institute of Directors providing valued continuous professional development \nprograms for directors;    \n2)  effective SOE board structure and composition; and  \n3)  strengthened SOEMD role in promoting SOE compliance with legislation.  \n \n13.  Output 1 will be supported by the largest project component. It is anticipated that the \nInstitute will be established as a separate legal entity, with a clear governance structure and \nmembership policy. Given an expected positive impact from a two-way flow of best practice \nideas for corporate governance between the state-owned and private sectors, the Government \nand ADB agree that the Institute and the Project should address both sectors equally. The TA to \nSOEMD will help the Institute address outputs 2 and 3.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  Stakeholders of the Government, ADB, and the private sector agree that the proposed \nInstitute should be wholly or largely established before delivery of the proposed ADB project. \nThis approach is anticipated to ensure ownership of, and commitment to, the Institute within \nSamoa, and to maximize the impact of the ADB TA by ensuring that appropriate counterparts \nand facilities are in place. The Government has agreed to appoint and convene a task force to \n                                                 \n11 SOEs that the Government has selected for privatization will continue to be a project focus until privatization has \nbeen completed. Indeed these SOEs deserve priority treatment to maximize their readiness and attractiveness for \nsale, and thereby their return to Government from the privatization process.  \n ", "4  \nsteer  the  Institute\u2019s  establishment.12  Appendix  2  includes  a  summary  of  key  issues  for \nconsideration and a proposed approach for establishing the Institute. The Institute is expected \nto be formally established by April 2005.  \n \n15.  The Institute should be fully self-financing by completion of the TA. The proposed ADB \nTA will, in effect, provide a decreasing level of subsidy for the Institute\u2019s establishment and \nrunning costs in its first 2 years of operation. The main recurrent cost of the Institute is likely to \nbe the salary of a full-time manager (locally hired) with sufficient experience and credibility to \nlead  the  Institute\u2019s  development.  Cost-effective  options  are  available  in  areas  such  as \naccommodation and training. A key sustainability initiative, with support of the CEO of the \nMinistry of Finance, will be for SOEs to include director training and development in their annual \nbudgets, and to directly meet the costs of institute membership and director training from these \nbudgets.  \n \n16.  Output 2 addresses a vital objective, but requires relatively modest inputs of short-term \npolicy  advice  (delivered  in  combination  with  other  inputs)  toward  the  establishment  of  a \nconsistent  and  forward-looking  government  policy  position  on  SOE  board  structure  and \ncomposition, including issues such as linking director remuneration to responsibilities.  \n \n17.  SOEMD  will  receive  further  assistance  in  its  role  of  strategically  managing  the \nGovernment\u2019s SOE portfolio and actively promoting best practices in SOEs. The reporting \nprocess by which SOEs regularly provide key information to SOEMD is becoming increasingly \neffective,  providing  important  management  information  to  the  Government.  The  TA  will \nstrengthen SOEMD\u2019s capacity to provide constructive feedback to SOEs and to analyze the \ninformation to determine key issues for portfolio-wide performance improvement. These higher-\norder issues, along with the need to ensure a proactive approach to capacity development for \nnew SOEMD staff, will be the focus of output 3. Intermittent short-term inputs are considered \nsufficient. A key assumption is that the Public Service Commission will approve a funded \nsubmission from Treasury to expand SOEMD\u2019s staff establishment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $475,000, with ADB contributing $400,000 (comprising \n$330,000 in foreign exchange and $70,000 in local currency costs), and the Government, \n$75,000  equivalent.  The  TA  will  be  financed  by  the  Japan  Special  fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government contribution will include salaries of counterpart staff in \nboth  Government  (SOEMD)  and  the  proposed  Institute,  with  the  Institute  largely  financed \nthrough  SOE  budget  allocations  for  memberships  and  professional  development  for  their \ndirectors. Appendix 3 provides summary cost and financing estimates. \n \n19.  The  advance  payment  facility  for  the  Institute  will  support  agreed  elements  or \nproportions of the cost of the Institute\u2019s training and related programs. It will be established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with detailed arrangements agreed upon \namong ADB, the Government, and the Institute. The funds ($75,000) will be provided in three \naccountable tranches of $25,000 each. The advance payment facility is proposed on the basis \nthat the Institute will be staffed and governed by experienced company directors with sound \nexperience in financial management and personal commitment to good corporate governance. \n                                                 \n12 ADB will fund a short-term domestic consultant to work with the task force. Specifically, the consultant will prepare \nan institute business plan for task force consideration, and eventual presentation for adoption to a stakeholder \nmeeting. \n ", "  5\nThe provision of an imprest account is consistent with the approach now being developed by the \nAustralian Agency for International Development and the New Zealand Agency for International \nDevelopment with the Government for short course training for the public and private sectors.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  SOEMD, in the Ministry of Finance, will be the Project\u2019s Executing Agency. Once fully \nestablished, the Institute will be the Implementing Agency for output 1, in accordance with \narrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n \n21.  The Project will be implemented over 24 to 30 months, with intermittent consultant \ninputs. The Project is expected to begin in April 2005 and be finished by October 2007.  \n \n22.  ADB will hire three international and three domestic consultants (11.5 person-months \nand 10 person-months, respectively) on a firm basis. The consultants will have expertise in: \ncorporate governance, boardroom ethics and practices, director training and mentoring, training \nprogram accreditation, director remuneration, government supervision of SOEs, development of \npublic sector capacity, and database development. These inputs are expected to contribute to \nthe Institute\u2019s fully effective and sustainable functioning by the end of the project period, and to \nimprovement of the Government\u2019s capacity to monitor and manage its shareholding in Samoa\u2019s \nSOEs. Appendix 4 gives the summary terms of reference. ADB will engage the consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Equipment will be procured in \naccordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB, and will become the property of the Institute \nupon completion of the TA.  \n \n23.  The consultancy firm will produce technical reports regarding (i) annual professional \ndevelopment programs that the Institute will conduct; (ii) issues and options for a system of \ndirector accreditation or qualification; (iii) best practice guidelines for boards; (iv) codes of ethics \nfor boards; (v) SOE board structures and remuneration arrangements; (vi) skills development for \nSOEMD; and (vii) SOEMD mandate and reporting arrangements. The firm will also provide an \ninception report, mid-term report, draft completion report, final completion report, and brief \nquarterly progress reports.  \n \n24.  The Institute will actively disseminate many TA key outputs to members and the public. \nImportant  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be:  institute  membership  numbers  and \nparticipation, the value perceived by chairs and directors of the Institute\u2019s work in promoting \npractical improvements in corporate governance, and the replacement rate of ministers and \npublic servants with independent directors.  The latter will indicate Government confidence in \nthe pool of competent directors that the Institute is developing. Improving quality of SOEMD \nfeedback to SOEs and reporting to government will also be key indicators for evaluation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Samoa for Strengthening State-Owned Enterprise Corporate Governance, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK  \nDesign Summary  Performance  Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions and Risks \nand Targets  Mechanisms \n Goal       \nImproved state-owned enterprise  Improved SOE financial  State-Owned \n(SOE) contributions to economic  performance and delivery of  Enterprise Monitoring \ngrowth and social development in  community service  Division of the Ministry \nSamoa  obligations  of Finance (SOEMD) \nquarterly reports  \n Purpose      Assumption: \nA conducive environment for sound  Improved compliance  SOEMD quarterly  \u2022  Improved corporate \ncorporate governance of Samoan  (timeliness and quality) with  reports  governance will positively \nSOEs  the requirements of the  impact SOE performance \n  Public Bodies Act for:  and/or reduce financial risk \n(i)  corporate planning,  to the Government.  \n(ii)  reporting,  Risks: \n(iii)  financial management,  \u2022  Unfavorable economic \nand  conditions impact \n(iv)  community service  performance \nobligations  \u2022  Implementation of \nPublic Bodies Act \nincomplete  \n Outputs      Assumptions: \n1.

Commitment to the proposal to establish an Institute of Directors (Institute)1 in Samoa is \nevident in both the public and private sectors. A fact-finding mission of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for a technical assistance (TA) project to strengthen state-owned enterprise (SOE) \ncorporate governance in Samoa found that the proposal is feasible and viable if the Institute is \nmanaged  prudently.  ADB  support  for  an  established  Institute  is  anticipated.  But  it  is \nrecommended that Samoan stakeholders play a lead role in the Institute\u2019s establishment before \nthe ADB project begins.  \n \n2.  The mission identified eight key issues for Samoan stakeholders to consider, relevant to \nthe new organization\u2019s establishment: \n  (i)        Issue 1: composition and role of a task force to establish the Institute; \n(ii)  Issue 2: the Institute\u2019s vision and mission; \n(iii)  Issue 3: ownership and legal entity; \n(iv)  Issue 4: roles and priorities; \n(v)  Issue 5: training; \n(vi)  Issue 6: qualifications framework; \n(vii)  Issue 7: the role of a code of ethics; and \n(viii)  Issue 8: the role of a database of members. \n \n3.  ADB understands that stakeholders from the Samoan public and private sectors will lead \nconsultation and decision making on these issues, drawing on the options set out below and \nadapting the Institute concept to the Samoan culture and legislative framework.1 \n \n1.  Issue 1: Recommended Composition And Role of a Task Force to Establish \nthe Institute of Directors \n \na.  Composition  \n4.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  should  appoint  and  convene  a  task  force  to  establish  an \norganization to train and provide professional support for company directors. The task force \nshould comprise respected directors from business and the community, and be chaired by a \nsenior businessperson with director experience and a commitment  to enhancing corporate \ngovernance standards.  \n \n5.  The task force members will provide planning, financial, and legal expertise, and will \nhave  a  strong  understanding  of  cultural  and  legal  contexts.  Members  will  seek  views  of \nprofessional organizations and the wider communities to recommend the legal structure and \nrange of services. \n \n6.  A senior local consultant, with experience as a board director, should provide advice and \nsecretariat services for the task force.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB will make small-scale assistance available before Institute establishment and commencement of the full ADB \nTA on Strengthening State-Owned Enterprise Corporate Governance.   \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nb.  Role of the Task Force  \n \n7.  The task force should oversee preparation of a business plan, and draft vision and \nmission statements and rules for presentation at a meeting for Institute establishment. The task \nforce should guide the consultant and consult interested stakeholders to generate ownership \nand commitment among potential Institute members.  \n \n8.  Matters that should be addressed in the business plan include: defining the Institute\u2019s \nlegal structure; values and philosophy; the benefits and range of services to be provided; \nmarketing strategy; a market analysis of potential members; membership criteria and fees; a \nfinancial model, including overheads; revenue from membership, courses, and other sources; \nanalysis of options for training, independently or jointly with existing training providers; use of a \ndatabase of directors; CEO skills, attributes, and roles; description of support staff; location of \noffices; and office equipment requirements.  \n \n9.  A key reference for this work should be the Global Corporate Governance Forum's \nToolkit for building director training organizations.2 \n \n10.  The draft institute rules should cover criteria for appointment of the chairperson, deputy \nchairperson, treasurer, secretary; criteria for membership, (including measures to encourage \naspiring directors); the quorum; and whether or not the CEO will be a board member.  \n \n11.  The task force chairperson should convene a meeting of all stakeholders at which he or \nshe will propose and seek endorsement of the Institute\u2019s business plan, vision and mission \nstatements, legal status, and rules. After these documents are endorsed at the meeting, the \ntask force chairperson will seek nominations and agree on the appointment of the Institute\u2019s \nchairperson, deputy chairperson, treasurer, and secretary.  \n \n12.  The task force should be disbanded upon appointment of the chairperson of the Institute.  \n \n2.   Issue 2:  A Vision and Mission for the Institute \n \n13.  The task force should draft a vision and mission for the new board to endorse or modify.  \n \n14.  A vision defines what the Institute wants to achieve. Some ideas: \n(i)  the highest professionalism in boardrooms; \n(ii)  role models of directors; and \n(iii)  profitable and sustainable businesses through effective boards. \n \n15.  The mission statement covers what the Institute should do, and how to do it, and tasks \nto achieve that vision. Ideas include: \n(i)  to  enhance  the  development  of  sustainable  and  profitable  corporations  by \nproviding  support  for  all  directors  through  training,  setting  standards,  and \nadvocating policy; and \n(ii)  to  foster  high  corporate  governance  standards  through  professional \ndevelopment, best practice guidelines, and policy development. \n \n                                                 \n2 Available at: http://www.gcgf.org/.  Select \u2018Director Training Toolkit\u2019.   \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n16.  The vision and mission statements should address whether the Institute\u2019s focus is on the \ndirectors, the boards, or the companies.  Examples from similar organizations are in Attachment \n1 to this Appendix.  \n \n3.  Issue 3:  Ownership and Legal Entity \n \n17.  The task force should analyze options for a legal structure that best allows the Institute \nto achieve its vision and mission. Five options may be considered: \n(i)  a partnership or joint venture involving, for example, chambers of commerce, \nmanufacturers\u2019  associations,  women  in  business  associations,  societies  of \naccountants, societies of lawyers, National University of Samoa (NUS), and the \nGovernment (represented by the State-Owned Enterprise Monitoring Division of \nthe Ministry of Finance (SOEMD); \n(ii)  a new, independent legal entity with its own legislation, or established under the \nexisting Incorporated Societies Act 1952; \n(iii)  no legal status of its own, but a new division under the auspices of an existing \norganization such as the Chamber of Commerce; \n(iv)  a new center established within an academic faculty at the National University of \nSamoa, NUS; and \n(v)  a new section in SOEMD.  \n \n4.  Issue 4:  Roles and Priorities for the Institute \n \n18.  Once established, the Institute board should establish priorities and a work program for \nthe short and longer terms. Potential services identified during the fact-finding mission were: \n(i)  delivering training courses, seminars, and other events as part of a structured, \nflexible, modular approach to professional development (Issue 5); \n(ii)  developing an Institute code of ethics (Issue 7); \n(iii)  developing codes of conduct for individual boards (Issue 7);  \n(iv)  developing a national code of best practice; \n(v)  maintaining a database of directors (Issue 8); \n(vi)  providing  best  practice  guidelines  for  boards,  based  on  international  best \npractices but tailored to Samoa\u2019s legislative and cultural environment; \n(vii)  networking with similar bodies within and beyond the Pacific;    \n(viii)  developing a board evaluation template tailored to public bodies in Samoa;   \n(ix)  designing  and  implementing  an  accreditation  and/or  qualification  system  for \ndirectors (Issue 6); \n(x)  providing a mentoring program for boards and individual directors;  \n(xi)  providing information for members and raising awareness on emerging issues in \ncorporate governance, both locally and internationally; and \n(xii)  representing members\u2019 interests to government and legal entities. \n \n19.  The ADB TA on Strengthening Corporate Governance in Samoa will provide technical \nadvice and an agreed-upon funding level to the board and CEO for these tasks during the \ndevelopment phase of the Institute (as long as 2 years), as set out in a TA paper agreed upon \nby ADB and the Government. Upon the Institute\u2019s establishment, the Government will delegate \nall  aspects  of  the  TA  project  that  relate  to  Institute  development  to  be  managed  and \nimplemented by the Institute board and CEO.   \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \n5.  Issue 5:  Professional Development  \n \n 20.  The Institute will develop a program of training courses, seminars, and other events that \nmeet  the  range  of  professional  development  needs  of  Institute  members  and  current  and \naspiring directors. This program will be offered through courses and seminars, whose schedule \nwill be published annually (see suggestions for initial topics in Attachment 2 to this Appendix). \n \n21.  The location, costing, venues, course fees, duration, tutors, and content of training \ncourses will be based on identified needs. Courses may be provided on particular subjects, \nsuch as new legislation, or for particular roles, such as chairpersons or an audit committee.  \n \n22.  Differing the duration of courses will allow some areas to be explored in more depth and \nallow time for case studies. Focus groups might help identify specific development courses. \n \n23.  The Institute will need to develop a pool of skilled local presenters who will stay abreast \nof international developments in corporate governance, and who also understand SOEMD\u2019s \nrequirements.  \n \n24.  Evaluation and feedback on quality and content will provide a good guide to provision of \nfuture training courses. \n \n25.  A seminar program might be run as a series of luncheon events, for example. The \nprogram should offer a combination of demand-driven topics for members, and should to take \nadvantage of the availability of visitors to Samoa with highly relevant experience.   \n \n26.  The Institute might seek full cost recovery or might seek extra funding to subsidize the \ncost of courses and seminars. Companies should ensure that a budget is made for director \ndevelopment. The Institute may wish to explore direct billing for SOEs.  \n \n27.  The  International  Finance  Corporation  Toolkit  for  Building  Director  Training \nOrganizations has examples of courses provided by other institutes.3  \n  \n6.  Issue 6: Qualifications Framework  \n \n28.  A  registration  process  acknowledges  commitment  to  director  competence  and \nprofessionalism in the boardroom. Too often the role of a director is misunderstood; recognition \nthrough a credible qualifications authority will help enhance the reputation of a professional \ndirector and help in selection and appointment of directors. Directors will be required to attend \ncourses annually to maintain accredited status. \n \n29.  It is important to understand that registration will not overcome all inappropriate director \nbehavior,  but  it  will  provide  evidence  that  the  registered  director  has  experience  and \nunderstands roles and responsibilities in the boardroom.  By way of example, in New Zealand to \nbecome an accredited director, members need to attend an interview with the Accreditation \nBoard and demonstrate: experience as a director of a publicly listed company or entity of \nsubstance; understanding of the rules and responsibilities of directors; and commitment to \n                                                 \n3 Available at: http://www.gcgf.org/.

Provisional Accreditation is available for less experienced \ndirectors.4     \n \n7.  Issue 7: Code of Conduct, Ethics, Best Practice, Principles, and Guidelines \n \n30.  A key Institute role will be to facilitate the development of codes of ethics (or conduct of \nbest practices). The codes of conducts could possibly be at three levels: (i) at the national level \nfor Samoa; (ii) for the Institute itself; and (iii) for each individual board. A code addresses issues \nrelating  to  ethical  practices  within  the  business  environment,  and  includes  the  practical \napplication of corporate values. It makes clear what is acceptable and what is unacceptable, \nand what is expected in the boardroom. Reference to relevant laws and regulations is important. \nIt is important to emphasize that the process of agreeing upon the content of codes is crucial to \ntheir effectiveness. The discussion and clarification of behavior and ethics to produce the code \nhelps establish and maintain its standards. Other items for consideration follow: \n(i)   Government of Mauritius.

The  Institute  can  play  a  key  role  in  contributing  to  the  appointment  process  and \nenhancing the selection of competent, experienced people for boards by maintaining an up-to-\ndate database of individuals willing to serve as directors on boards.  \n \n32.  The first step might simply be to compile a list of names, but as time and resources \npermit,  data  for  each  person  can  be  added  to  identify  his  or  her  particular  skills  and \nexperiences. That will enable the selectors to identify the relevant skills set to match a skills gap \non a board. In this way board composition can be crafted to suit the stage of development of the \ncompany, and the role of its board. The board evaluation process might feed information back \ninto the database to enhance the selection process. \n \n33.  The Institute could choose a panel of two respected senior directors to interview each \ncandidate in the database to assess whether or not he or she has the skills, experience, and \npersonal  attributes  to  contribute  as  a  director  in  the  boardroom.  The  highest  professional \nintegrity must be used in database development. The information must be treated with the \nutmost confidentiality to avoid abusing the individuals\u2019 privacy. An institute database can help in \nthe  appointment  process  for  both  the  government  sector  and  the  private  sector  when \ncommercial boards seek new directors.5  \n \n                                                 \n4 Further information on New Zealand arrangements is available at: http://www.iod.org.nz/opinion/accreditation.html. \n5 See Global Corporate Governance Forum.
