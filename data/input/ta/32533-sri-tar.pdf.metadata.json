During the March 1998 Country Programming Mission, the Government initiated\ndiscussions on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service in general and\npublic expenditure systems in particular. In response to the Government's request, the Bank\ngranted a small-scale technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Modernization of the Ministry of\nFinance and Planning (MOFP).1 In addition Bank staff reached an understanding with MOFP on\nthe parameters for a broader program to strengthen public expenditure management. Further\ndiscussions on the design of the cluster TA, terms of reference for consultants, cost estimates,\nand implementation arrangements were held during a mission in April 1999 and during the\nBank's Annual Meeting.2 The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Sri Lanka's public institutions have helped the Government to achieve high levels of\nsocial development, economic growth, and low population growth. Notwithstanding these\nachievements, many public institutions are in need of modernization to face future challenges.\nThe key governance and public management issues include high fiscal deficit, excessive size of\nthe civil service, insufficient operating and maintenance expenditure, severe skill and motivation\nproblems, and fragmented government structures and systems.\n3. The country's budgetary system performs well in terms of the first objective of public\nexpenditure management (PEM)\u2014aggregate expenditure control. However, performance is\nweak in terms of the other two objectives: sectoral resource allocation in conformity with policy\npriorities, and flexible and effective operational management. Thus, fiscal discipline has been\nfairly well served by the present system, but not the longer term development and public service\ngoals. For instance, the shortened perspective of expenditure decisions precludes attention to\nthe looming crisis of the publicly funded pension system, which in part stems from life\nexpectancy increasing to one of the highest levels in Asia.\n4. The lack of PEM effectiveness can be attributed to the general decline of the civil service\nand administrative apparatus\u2014diagnosed over 12 years ago by the Government's\nAdministrative Reform Commission. Reasons identified include insufficient incentives, obstacles\nto internal mobility, and a growing mismatch between civil servants' skills and their changing\ntasks. Although some action has been taken since then, most of the recommendations have not\nbeen implemented.4 This persistent decline in administrative effectiveness has led to an erosion\nof the quality of social services for which Sri Lanka is ustIy praised.\n5. The Government has taken some steps to address these problems. For example, an\nearly retirement and severance program was enacted in 1990-1991 with World Bank support.\nThis program did not have the desired results because it was not properly targeted, not time-\nbound, and not costed realistically. In 1996, the Bank provided TA to formulate broad-based\nadministrative reforms5 in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. A\n1 TA 3038-SRI: Institutional Modernization of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, for $148,000, approved on 3 July\n1998.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 1998.\nFor a summary, see Schiavo-Campo, S. 1998. Public Administration in Sri Lanka: A Bird's Eye View. Strategy and\nPolicy Office. Asian Development Bank, Manila.\nWanasinghe, 1994. Activating the Administrative Reform Process in Sri Lanka. Research Studies, Governance\nSeries No. 2. Colombo: Institute for Policy Studies.\nTA 2616-SRI: Public Administration Reform, for $275,000, approved on 24 July 1996.", "United Nations Development Programme-funded project supported the activities identified under\nthe TA. However, other considerations, including the attention and resources absorbed by the\ncivil conflict, have prevented the Government from launching a large-scale program of\nadministrative and civil service reform.\n6. The Government recognizes that there is an urgent need to shore up the quality of public\nservices. The situation is conducive to constructive interventions to modernize selected\nimportant public sector functions, particularly the PEM system. Focused assistance can be\nespecially effective. For example, the Bank-supported Financial Management Training Program\n6 \nloan,  which is nearing completion, has reduced financial reporting lags and provided valuable\nbasic computing know-how and skills to a substantial number of civil servants at the national\nand subnational levels. Similarly, the World Bank is currently assisting MOFP's Fiscal Policy\nDepartment with expenditure monitoring. In another example, the Government has taken a\nstrong stance against public sector corruption, establishing the Permanent Commission for the\nPrevention of Bribery and Corruption and appointing a special presidential commission to\ninquire into maipractices and irregularities in public bodies. The former investigated about 6,000\ncases for prosecution between 1995 and 1997.\n7. The Government's strategy is two-pronged: it seeks to position itself to launch a far-\nreaching administrative reform program when the circumstances are right, and at the same\ntime, it seeks to improve targeted administrative functions and policies, thus establishing the\nbasic conditions to facilitate the implementation of such a program. In this context, the 1998\nCountry Programming Mission agreed to proceed with the Government's request to support\nimprovements in key aspects of PEM.\n8. MOFP is responsible for the regulation, planning, revenue collection, management, and\naccounting of public finances. MOFP is divided into 13 departments, with a total of about 8,400\nstaff. Of these, five departments with about 700 staff are responsible for the key elements of\nPEM.7 The proposed assistance to these departments will enhance financial accountability, help\nreduce corruption, provide a strong foundation for eventual comprehensive administrative\nreform, and improve public resource efficiency.\n9. To improve fiscal discipline, new systems will be designed to better monitor and review\nthe consistency of the expenditure plans, particularly the Public Investment Program, within an\nintegrated macroeconomic framework covering the national accounts, budget, and balance of\npayments. To improve resource allocation, there will be better analysis and documentation of\nproject proposals, a full set of forward estimates for all components of public outlays (including\nrecurrent spending requirements) over a multiple-year horizon, and better alignment of foreign\nassistance with development priorities, avoiding overlaps and increasing the consistency of\nsector policies. To improve operational management, a new computerized system will integrate\nall key financial management functions into a cohesive system on a common database. The TA\nwill help upgrade skills of relevant financial and planning cadres and enact requisite legislation.\nThese new systems will better monitor disbursement, physical implementation, and economic\ntargets, feeding back into a rolling, multiyear investment plan. The Government is strongly\nsupportive of such initiatives.\no \nLoan 1275-SR: Financial Management Training, for $13 Million, approved on 29 November 1993.\nAsian Development Bank. 1999. Sri Lanka. Institutional Modernization of the Ministiy of Finance,  Final Report.\nManila, 1998 data, p. 62 and Appendix D, 1999.", "10. In preparation, MOFP has established the Management Services Department as a focal\npoint for an improved personal record system, competency frameworks, revised employment\nconditions, and a fast-track, career-planning system. Other targeted improvements under\nconsideration include sequestering vacant positions, freezing gross recruitment, placing the\nPublic Service Commission under the authority of the President and restoring its legal\nautonomy, and proclaiming a moratorium on the creation of any new public sector bodies.\n11. A TA cluster approach is considered the most appropriate modality to address the\nmultifaceted problem. The TA is designed to address interrelated constraints, while providing\nflexibility to the responsible departments in developing detailed outputs, terms of reference, and\nbudgets for individual subprojects. The strengthening of PEM and the public expenditure\ninformation system (PETS) within MOFP and across all ministries of the Government requires\ncareful sequencing of a number of specialist inputs from the fields of public investment planning,\naccounting, and information technology (IT) systems, and the human resources necessary to\nmake the new systems and protocols work. The cluster approach will help to synchronize the\nsequencing of the subprojects as decisions in one could materially alter the design of another.\nFor example, the determination of an IT strategy could affect activities under the Human\nResource Management subproject, particularly the training requirements and the question of\nretention policies. Other linkages exist between subprojects, and call for flexibility in design and\nimplementation.$\nIII.\t THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n12. The objective of the TA is to support comprehensive modernization of the Sri Lankan\nPEM to improve fiscal discipline and expenditure control, strategic allocation of resources\nconsistent with policy priorities, and operational management.\nB.\t Scope\n13. The TA will consist of five closely related subprojects, managed respectively by the State\nAccounts, National Planning, National Budget, Management Services, and Public Finance\ndepartments of MOFP.\n1.\t Public Expenditure Information System\n14. An integrated PEIS will be designed, in cooperation with the State Accounts Department\n(SAD). The internal controls of the current accounting systems will be strengthened, with\nreference to the internal audit manual, followed by the development of a comprehensive IT\nstrategy for the public expenditure function across the whole of government. The strategy will\nspecify the software and hardware requirements for the system based on user needs, and\nidentify capacity-building requirements to install, operate, and maintain the system. The IT\nstrategy will have important implications for the Human Resource Management subproject,\nwhich must be responsive to the new system.\n8 The Board will be informed of the progress of the TA cluster through brief information papers.", "4\n15. The principal subproject output will be the development and specification of a PEIS\ncapable of supporting data transfers from other agencies and of (i) budget classification, chart of\naccounts maintenance, and budget preparation; (ii) exchequer accounting and cash-flow\nforecasting and management; (iii) development fund accounting; (iv) commitment control; (v)\npayroll management with an interface to the personnel and pension systems; (vi) public debt\naccounting; (vii) general ledger accounting, including management and project accounting; and\n(viii) management and statutory reporting.\n16. While the major determiners of the design criteria for the PEIS will be SAD, the National\nPlanning Department (NPD), and the National Budget Department (NBD), the system will also\nmeet the requirements of all other departments within MOFP as well as those for financial\nmanagement information of chief accounting officers throughout the civil service.\n17. To develop the PEIS and reinvigorate internal control procedures throughout the public\nservice, task forces will be formed to look at groups of about 10 ministries to determine the state\nof their preparedness. These task forces will use the Internal Audit Reference Manual to\nprogressively study each administrative unit in Government, ensure that internal control\nprocedures are operational and understood, and that external controls on data processing are\nbeing followed. The distribution of administrative units to each task force will assigned by SAD.\nAs new accounting systems are developed, the task force will support operational areas in their\nintroduction, operation, and maintenance.\n18. Each task force will be supported by domestic consultants working under the general\nguidance of an international consultant. Each task force will include personnel from SAD, the\nauditor general, and from officers seconded from line departments. Secondments can be made\nfor the time a task force is working in a particular administrative unit or for periods sufficiently\nlong to enable an officer to be fully conversant with what the working party is doing. To make\noptimal use of the consulting support provided, staff will be seconded by line departments to\neach task force on a full-time basis.\n2.\t Public Investment Program\n19. Under this subproject, coordination of the capital component of the budget will be\nimproved, in collaboration with sector ministries and within the framework of a three-year rolling\nprogram. Tools and procedures will be improved for macroeconomic forecasting, project\nscreening, budget preparation, and expenditure monitoring. The capacity of NPD and sector\nagencies to address public investment programming issues will have a major impact on the\ntiming of the development of a medium-term expenditure framework and the appropriate level of\ndisaggregation.\n20. Key activities will include\n(i) design and implementation of a rolling medium-term expenditure framework\n(MTEF);\n(ii) establishment of a governing framework for capital and expenditure budgets, and\nmethods for analyzing of the impact of the investment program on the recurrent\nbudget;", "(iii) review of the present capital expenditure monitoring system with appropriate\nrecommendations on reporting requirements, which will be an input to the design\nof the PEIS;\n(iv) development of capacity in at least three major line agencies to develop sector\ninvestment programs, evaluate project proposals, and produce effective advice\non sector expenditure;\n(v) review of line agency organizational arrangements for preparing sector public\ninvestment programs; and\n(vi) collaboration with NBD to improve procedures, allocate tasks, and establish a\ncalendar for the preparation of the multiyear expenditure program.\n21.\t MOFP will establish two task forces for this subproject:\n(i) The first will work on developing line agency capacity for expenditure\nprogramming and project preparation. Led by an officer from NPD with staff\nseconded from line agencies, it will develop a set of training modules to build\ncapacity of the Planning Service. It will be supported by the subproject consulting\nteam, and in particular by the consultants assigned to help line departments\nimprove their program planning.\n(ii) The second will design and introduce improved procedures for formulatin the\ndevelopment budget and its subsequent monitoring within the overall logic of\nMTEF. It will need to work in parallel and collaboratively with the NBD team\nworking on the development of the MTEF. This task force will include one officer\nfrom NBD to ensure that recurrent budget requirements are taken into account.\n3.\t Medium-Term Expenditure Framework\n22. Under this subproject, the framework will be developed to improve coordination of the\ncurrent and capital expenditure components of the budget in a multiyear perspective and in\ncollaboration with sector ministries. As a result, expenditures will be allocated by the NBD in\nconformity with Government policy priorities.\n23.\t Key activities will include\n(i) design and implementation of a rolling MTEF,\n(ii) determination of MTEF's coverage, procedures, and schedule for its preparation;\nand coordination mechanisms with the preparation of the annual budget including\nmethods for updating cost estimates of programs and projects and for analyzing\nthe impact of the investment program on the recurrent budget;\n(iii) enhancement of the World Bank-financed expenditure monitoring system within\nthe framework of the proposed PEIS;\n(iv) design and implementation of improved procedures and allocation of tasks within\nNBD;", "6\n(v) establishment of a schedule for the preparation of the multiyear expenditure\nprogram;\n(vi) laying down procedures to reinforce the prioritization of expenditure programs;\n(vii) improvement of methods to scrutinize sectoral programs;\n(viii) determination of strategies to improve the coordination of the various monitoring\nsystems; and\n(ix) preparation of a functional analysis for a system to organize information for the\npreparation of the budget and the multiyear expenditure program.\n24. MOFP will staff a task force led by NBD to design and introduce improved procedures\nfor budget formulation within MOFP and the subsequent monitoring of budget performance.\nThis task force will include an officer from NPD to ensure that development budget requirements\nare taken into account.\n4.\t Human Resource Management\n25. This subproject will focus on improving human resource management for the Sri Lanka\nPlanning Service and the Sri Lanka Accounting Service, as well as for officers working in NBD,\nPublic Finance Department, and Management Services Department (MSD) of MOFP. It will\nestablish a personnel record system, competency frameworks, and revised employment\nconditions, and examine a fast-track career planning system.\n26. Key activities will include the following:\n(i) prepare a diagnostic study of the personnel system operating for the Sri Lanka\nPlanning Service and Sri Lanka Accounting Service, and recommendations, if\nappropriate, of options for change in their management.\n(ii) develop and implement a human resource management plan for each service.\nThe plan will consider the strategies necessary to move staff to more\nperformance-orientated conditions of employment. It will be consistent with the\ncorporate plans developed in each department, including for MSD.\n(iii) design and implement a fast-track career planning program to ensure that\nplanning and financial management throughout the public service are managed\neffectively. The system will include an accelerated training program, a set of\nsecondments to expose trainees to a full range of requirements for a fully\neffective planning or accounting officer, and a mentoring scheme.\n(iv) develop MSD capacity, (e.g. through individual training, and improved processes\nand systems) to support the two service boards.\n(v) establish competency frameworks for core accounting, budgeting, and planning\npositions (including supporting indicative job descriptions).\n(vi) develop revised service conditions for the accounting and planning cadres\nconsistent with current employment practices in the Sri Lankan public service,", "7\nensuring that good staff are recruited and retained, and that positions are filled by\ncompetent officers.\n(vii) set establishment levels for all accounting and planning functions in the public\nservice based on the new systems introduced by other subprojects in this cluster\nTA.\n27. MSD will lead two task forces, one each for Sri Lanka Accounting Service and Sri Lanka\nPlanning Service, to work on designing and implementing human resource management plans\nfor the accountants and planning services. Each team will work closely with the teams\nimplementing the MTEF and PEIS. The team working on the plan for the accountants service\nwill be building on the training programs developed by the Financial Management Training\nProject. Close liaison will be maintained with the Ministry of Public Administration, Home\nAffairs, and Plantation industries.\n28. In addition to the lead officer from MSD, other members will be co-opted from each\nservice. Each team will include staff from the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of\nPublic Administration, Home Affairs, and Plantation Industries, either as a full-time member or\nas an observer and adviser.\n5.\t Revised Finance Act and Internal Audit\n29. An overall financial legislative framework will be developed under this subproject in\ncooperation with the Public Finance Department to strengthen the Government's financial\ncontrol over its programs and provide clear guidance to those with financial responsibilitk In\naddition, the internal audit function will be reinforced,\n30. Key activities will include\n(i) review the financial accountability mechanisms within government including the\neffectiveness of the Public Accounts Committee in its role of nonpartisan\noversight of agency efficiency and effectiveness; and development of a program\nto improve the effectiveness of the internal audit function;9\n(ii) prepare a set of manuals covering budgeting, accounting, administrative, and\nstores procedures to function under the authority of the financial regulations;\n(iii) review internal audit procedures and updating the Internal Audit Manual to\ninclude the improved procedures;\n(iv) draft an internal audit charter setting out the powers, duties, and responsibilities\nof the internal audit function;\n(v) publish a comprehensive set of financial regulations supporting the revised\nfinance act; and\n(vi) draft instructions for a revised finance act.\nThis work will, help to improve the quality of oversight over publicly-funded activities, as called for in the Bank's\nAnticorruption Policy (R89-98).", "8\n31. MOFP will staff three task forces to address each of the following (i) a revised finance\nact; (ii) a comprehensive set of financial regulations; and (iii) manuals covering budgeting,\naccounting, administrative, and stores procedures to be issued under the authority of the\nfinancial regulations.\n32. Each task force will be supported by domestic consultants working under the general\nguidance of an international consultant The task force on the revised finance act will consist of\nstaff from the Public Finance Department, the Attorney General's Department, the Office of\nAuditor General, and the staff of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for passage of the\nfinance act. The task forces on the financial regulations and the manuals will be extensions of\nthe present teams currently in process of revising the financial regulations.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n33. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3,765,000, comprising a foreign exchange cost\nof $2,077,000 and local currency cost of $1,688,000 equivalent. Detailed cost estimates and\nproposed financing arrangements are given in Appendix 2. The Bank will fund $3,000,000 to\ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and $923,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The\nfinancing will be provided on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA Program. The\nGovernment's contribution will be in kind and will cover items of expenditure estimated at\n$765,000 equivalent.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n34. MOFP will be the Executing Agency (EA). The TA subprojects will be implemented by\nfive departments within MOFP (Appendix 3). Each will assign counterpart teams to implement\nthe planned subprojects. The External Resources Department will facilitate the essential\ncoordination of activities, with the director general acting as TA director and liaising with the\nconsulting team leader. The consulting team and counterpart team for each subproject in the TA\ncluster will report to the director general concerned. At specific milestones (e.g., completion of\nthe IT strategy or the draft finance act would normally constitute a milestone), a workshop will\nbe held to review progress and determine further work. Senior MOFP personnel and officials\nfrom other key ministries will attend and offer guidance. Bank staff will be intensively involved in\nthe supervision and monitoring of the TA cluster to ensure proper implementation.\n35. The counterpart teams will be guided by an international consulting team that will\noperate in a facilitative mode, and be coordinated and directed by the team leader of the PEIS\nsubproject. The counterpart teams wilt be responsible for achieving the targeted outputs of each\nsubproject, other than very technical outputs (like the IT strategy), which will be prepared by the\nconsulting team. Study tours will serve the essential function of demonstrating to counterparts\nthe operation of successful PEM systems elsewhere, and learning from in-depth discussions\nwith the technicians responsible for implementing these systems.\n36. The five subprojects will include participatory workshops and study tours. A program of\ntraining courses will be developed to ensure that there is a pool of competent officers ready to\nfill each position in the accounting and planning functions. The Government will seek funding\nfor skills development from bilateral funding agencies like the Australian Agency for International\nDevelopment, which has a grant training program available for Sri Lanka. An option that will be\ndeveloped is a twinning arrangement joining an international training institution with at least two", "9\nSri Lankan training institutes10 to design and deliver training courses. The involvement of at\nleast two Sn Lankan institutes will introduce an element of competition to ensure that the\ncourses continue to be delivered effectively and meet MOFP's needs.\n37. The TA cluster will be implemented over a 36-month period starting in January 2000\n(Appendix 3). As the program must be responsive to MOFP's requirements and availability of\nkey staff, adjustments may be made to the implementation schedule. The budget is based on a\ntotal of 69 person-months of international consulting and 112 person-months of domestic\nconsulting. The consultants will be engaged by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the\nengagement of domestic consultants. A lead consulting firm (and possibly associated firms) will\nbe selected on the basis of a full technical proposal specifying effective methodologies to\naddress the outputs specified in Appendix 4. For quality control purposes, each subproject team\nwill have consultants from the lead firm or from associated firms that have core businesses in\ntechnical areas relevant to the subproject A phased-service agreement will be negotiated with\nthe firm to allow the flexibility required for a cluster TA. At important milestones, 11 progress will\nbe reviewed jointly by the Government and the Bank. Based on these reviews, indicative terms\nof reference in Appendix 4 will be further specified and adjusted as necessary.\n38. The consultants will prepare inception, interim, draft final, and final reports for each\nsubproject. The consultants will also assist in developing, and as appropriate, delivering\ninternational and domestic training programs, and act as resource persons in domestic\nworkshops to be organized in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.\nProcurement of equipment will be undertaken following the Bank's guidelines for procurement.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n39. The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri\nLanka in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 for the purpose of\nStrengthening Public Expenditure Management Systems.\n10 The training institutes to be considered will include the Institute of Public Finance and Development Accountancy,\nNational Institute of Business Management, Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration, and University of\nSri Jayawardenepura.\nMilestones will be determined by MOFP management when each subproject is planned in detail. The completion of\nthe IT strategy and the human resource management plan will certainly be two milestones. Other milestones will be\npoints in the program where decisions about future directions are to be made by MOFP management to enable the\nsubproject to progress.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

During the March 1998 Country Programming Mission, the Government initiated\ndiscussions on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service in general and\npublic expenditure systems in particular. In response to the Government's request, the Bank\ngranted a small-scale technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Modernization of the Ministry of\nFinance and Planning (MOFP).1 In addition Bank staff reached an understanding with MOFP on\nthe parameters for a broader program to strengthen public expenditure management. Further\ndiscussions on the design of the cluster TA, terms of reference for consultants, cost estimates,\nand implementation arrangements were held during a mission in April 1999 and during the\nBank's Annual Meeting.2 The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Sri Lanka's public institutions have helped the Government to achieve high levels of\nsocial development, economic growth, and low population growth. Notwithstanding these\nachievements, many public institutions are in need of modernization to face future challenges.\nThe key governance and public management issues include high fiscal deficit, excessive size of\nthe civil service, insufficient operating and maintenance expenditure, severe skill and motivation\nproblems, and fragmented government structures and systems.\n3. The country's budgetary system performs well in terms of the first objective of public\nexpenditure management (PEM)\u2014aggregate expenditure control. However, performance is\nweak in terms of the other two objectives: sectoral resource allocation in conformity with policy\npriorities, and flexible and effective operational management. Thus, fiscal discipline has been\nfairly well served by the present system, but not the longer term development and public service\ngoals. For instance, the shortened perspective of expenditure decisions precludes attention to\nthe looming crisis of the publicly funded pension system, which in part stems from life\nexpectancy increasing to one of the highest levels in Asia.\n4. The lack of PEM effectiveness can be attributed to the general decline of the civil service\nand administrative apparatus\u2014diagnosed over 12 years ago by the Government's\nAdministrative Reform Commission. Reasons identified include insufficient incentives, obstacles\nto internal mobility, and a growing mismatch between civil servants' skills and their changing\ntasks. Although some action has been taken since then, most of the recommendations have not\nbeen implemented.4 This persistent decline in administrative effectiveness has led to an erosion\nof the quality of social services for which Sri Lanka is ustIy praised.\n5. The Government has taken some steps to address these problems. For example, an\nearly retirement and severance program was enacted in 1990-1991 with World Bank support.\nThis program did not have the desired results because it was not properly targeted, not time-\nbound, and not costed realistically. In 1996, the Bank provided TA to formulate broad-based\nadministrative reforms5 in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. A\n1 TA 3038-SRI: Institutional Modernization of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, for $148,000, approved on 3 July\n1998.\n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 1998.\nFor a summary, see Schiavo-Campo, S. 1998. Public Administration in Sri Lanka: A Bird's Eye View. Strategy and\nPolicy Office. Asian Development Bank, Manila.\nWanasinghe, 1994. Activating the Administrative Reform Process in Sri Lanka. Research Studies, Governance\nSeries No. 2. Colombo: Institute for Policy Studies.\nTA 2616-SRI: Public Administration Reform, for $275,000, approved on 24 July 1996.", "United Nations Development Programme-funded project supported the activities identified under\nthe TA. However, other considerations, including the attention and resources absorbed by the\ncivil conflict, have prevented the Government from launching a large-scale program of\nadministrative and civil service reform.\n6. The Government recognizes that there is an urgent need to shore up the quality of public\nservices. The situation is conducive to constructive interventions to modernize selected\nimportant public sector functions, particularly the PEM system. Focused assistance can be\nespecially effective. For example, the Bank-supported Financial Management Training Program\n6 \nloan,  which is nearing completion, has reduced financial reporting lags and provided valuable\nbasic computing know-how and skills to a substantial number of civil servants at the national\nand subnational levels. Similarly, the World Bank is currently assisting MOFP's Fiscal Policy\nDepartment with expenditure monitoring. In another example, the Government has taken a\nstrong stance against public sector corruption, establishing the Permanent Commission for the\nPrevention of Bribery and Corruption and appointing a special presidential commission to\ninquire into maipractices and irregularities in public bodies. The former investigated about 6,000\ncases for prosecution between 1995 and 1997.\n7. The Government's strategy is two-pronged: it seeks to position itself to launch a far-\nreaching administrative reform program when the circumstances are right, and at the same\ntime, it seeks to improve targeted administrative functions and policies, thus establishing the\nbasic conditions to facilitate the implementation of such a program. In this context, the 1998\nCountry Programming Mission agreed to proceed with the Government's request to support\nimprovements in key aspects of PEM.\n8. MOFP is responsible for the regulation, planning, revenue collection, management, and\naccounting of public finances. MOFP is divided into 13 departments, with a total of about 8,400\nstaff. Of these, five departments with about 700 staff are responsible for the key elements of\nPEM.7 The proposed assistance to these departments will enhance financial accountability, help\nreduce corruption, provide a strong foundation for eventual comprehensive administrative\nreform, and improve public resource efficiency.\n9. To improve fiscal discipline, new systems will be designed to better monitor and review\nthe consistency of the expenditure plans, particularly the Public Investment Program, within an\nintegrated macroeconomic framework covering the national accounts, budget, and balance of\npayments. To improve resource allocation, there will be better analysis and documentation of\nproject proposals, a full set of forward estimates for all components of public outlays (including\nrecurrent spending requirements) over a multiple-year horizon, and better alignment of foreign\nassistance with development priorities, avoiding overlaps and increasing the consistency of\nsector policies. To improve operational management, a new computerized system will integrate\nall key financial management functions into a cohesive system on a common database. The TA\nwill help upgrade skills of relevant financial and planning cadres and enact requisite legislation.\nThese new systems will better monitor disbursement, physical implementation, and economic\ntargets, feeding back into a rolling, multiyear investment plan. The Government is strongly\nsupportive of such initiatives.\no \nLoan 1275-SR: Financial Management Training, for $13 Million, approved on 29 November 1993.\nAsian Development Bank. 1999. Sri Lanka. Institutional Modernization of the Ministiy of Finance,  Final Report.\nManila, 1998 data, p. 62 and Appendix D, 1999.", "10. In preparation, MOFP has established the Management Services Department as a focal\npoint for an improved personal record system, competency frameworks, revised employment\nconditions, and a fast-track, career-planning system. Other targeted improvements under\nconsideration include sequestering vacant positions, freezing gross recruitment, placing the\nPublic Service Commission under the authority of the President and restoring its legal\nautonomy, and proclaiming a moratorium on the creation of any new public sector bodies.\n11. A TA cluster approach is considered the most appropriate modality to address the\nmultifaceted problem. The TA is designed to address interrelated constraints, while providing\nflexibility to the responsible departments in developing detailed outputs, terms of reference, and\nbudgets for individual subprojects. The strengthening of PEM and the public expenditure\ninformation system (PETS) within MOFP and across all ministries of the Government requires\ncareful sequencing of a number of specialist inputs from the fields of public investment planning,\naccounting, and information technology (IT) systems, and the human resources necessary to\nmake the new systems and protocols work. The cluster approach will help to synchronize the\nsequencing of the subprojects as decisions in one could materially alter the design of another.\nFor example, the determination of an IT strategy could affect activities under the Human\nResource Management subproject, particularly the training requirements and the question of\nretention policies. Other linkages exist between subprojects, and call for flexibility in design and\nimplementation.$\nIII.\t THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n12. The objective of the TA is to support comprehensive modernization of the Sri Lankan\nPEM to improve fiscal discipline and expenditure control, strategic allocation of resources\nconsistent with policy priorities, and operational management.\nB.\t Scope\n13. The TA will consist of five closely related subprojects, managed respectively by the State\nAccounts, National Planning, National Budget, Management Services, and Public Finance\ndepartments of MOFP.\n1.\t Public Expenditure Information System\n14. An integrated PEIS will be designed, in cooperation with the State Accounts Department\n(SAD). The internal controls of the current accounting systems will be strengthened, with\nreference to the internal audit manual, followed by the development of a comprehensive IT\nstrategy for the public expenditure function across the whole of government. The strategy will\nspecify the software and hardware requirements for the system based on user needs, and\nidentify capacity-building requirements to install, operate, and maintain the system. The IT\nstrategy will have important implications for the Human Resource Management subproject,\nwhich must be responsive to the new system.\n8 The Board will be informed of the progress of the TA cluster through brief information papers.", "4\n15. The principal subproject output will be the development and specification of a PEIS\ncapable of supporting data transfers from other agencies and of (i) budget classification, chart of\naccounts maintenance, and budget preparation; (ii) exchequer accounting and cash-flow\nforecasting and management; (iii) development fund accounting; (iv) commitment control; (v)\npayroll management with an interface to the personnel and pension systems; (vi) public debt\naccounting; (vii) general ledger accounting, including management and project accounting; and\n(viii) management and statutory reporting.\n16. While the major determiners of the design criteria for the PEIS will be SAD, the National\nPlanning Department (NPD), and the National Budget Department (NBD), the system will also\nmeet the requirements of all other departments within MOFP as well as those for financial\nmanagement information of chief accounting officers throughout the civil service.\n17. To develop the PEIS and reinvigorate internal control procedures throughout the public\nservice, task forces will be formed to look at groups of about 10 ministries to determine the state\nof their preparedness. These task forces will use the Internal Audit Reference Manual to\nprogressively study each administrative unit in Government, ensure that internal control\nprocedures are operational and understood, and that external controls on data processing are\nbeing followed. The distribution of administrative units to each task force will assigned by SAD.\nAs new accounting systems are developed, the task force will support operational areas in their\nintroduction, operation, and maintenance.\n18. Each task force will be supported by domestic consultants working under the general\nguidance of an international consultant. Each task force will include personnel from SAD, the\nauditor general, and from officers seconded from line departments. Secondments can be made\nfor the time a task force is working in a particular administrative unit or for periods sufficiently\nlong to enable an officer to be fully conversant with what the working party is doing. To make\noptimal use of the consulting support provided, staff will be seconded by line departments to\neach task force on a full-time basis.\n2.\t Public Investment Program\n19. Under this subproject, coordination of the capital component of the budget will be\nimproved, in collaboration with sector ministries and within the framework of a three-year rolling\nprogram. Tools and procedures will be improved for macroeconomic forecasting, project\nscreening, budget preparation, and expenditure monitoring. The capacity of NPD and sector\nagencies to address public investment programming issues will have a major impact on the\ntiming of the development of a medium-term expenditure framework and the appropriate level of\ndisaggregation.\n20. Key activities will include\n(i) design and implementation of a rolling medium-term expenditure framework\n(MTEF);\n(ii) establishment of a governing framework for capital and expenditure budgets, and\nmethods for analyzing of the impact of the investment program on the recurrent\nbudget;", "(iii) review of the present capital expenditure monitoring system with appropriate\nrecommendations on reporting requirements, which will be an input to the design\nof the PEIS;\n(iv) development of capacity in at least three major line agencies to develop sector\ninvestment programs, evaluate project proposals, and produce effective advice\non sector expenditure;\n(v) review of line agency organizational arrangements for preparing sector public\ninvestment programs; and\n(vi) collaboration with NBD to improve procedures, allocate tasks, and establish a\ncalendar for the preparation of the multiyear expenditure program.\n21.\t MOFP will establish two task forces for this subproject:\n(i) The first will work on developing line agency capacity for expenditure\nprogramming and project preparation. Led by an officer from NPD with staff\nseconded from line agencies, it will develop a set of training modules to build\ncapacity of the Planning Service. It will be supported by the subproject consulting\nteam, and in particular by the consultants assigned to help line departments\nimprove their program planning.\n(ii) The second will design and introduce improved procedures for formulatin the\ndevelopment budget and its subsequent monitoring within the overall logic of\nMTEF. It will need to work in parallel and collaboratively with the NBD team\nworking on the development of the MTEF. This task force will include one officer\nfrom NBD to ensure that recurrent budget requirements are taken into account.\n3.\t Medium-Term Expenditure Framework\n22. Under this subproject, the framework will be developed to improve coordination of the\ncurrent and capital expenditure components of the budget in a multiyear perspective and in\ncollaboration with sector ministries. As a result, expenditures will be allocated by the NBD in\nconformity with Government policy priorities.\n23.\t Key activities will include\n(i) design and implementation of a rolling MTEF,\n(ii) determination of MTEF's coverage, procedures, and schedule for its preparation;\nand coordination mechanisms with the preparation of the annual budget including\nmethods for updating cost estimates of programs and projects and for analyzing\nthe impact of the investment program on the recurrent budget;\n(iii) enhancement of the World Bank-financed expenditure monitoring system within\nthe framework of the proposed PEIS;\n(iv) design and implementation of improved procedures and allocation of tasks within\nNBD;", "6\n(v) establishment of a schedule for the preparation of the multiyear expenditure\nprogram;\n(vi) laying down procedures to reinforce the prioritization of expenditure programs;\n(vii) improvement of methods to scrutinize sectoral programs;\n(viii) determination of strategies to improve the coordination of the various monitoring\nsystems; and\n(ix) preparation of a functional analysis for a system to organize information for the\npreparation of the budget and the multiyear expenditure program.\n24. MOFP will staff a task force led by NBD to design and introduce improved procedures\nfor budget formulation within MOFP and the subsequent monitoring of budget performance.\nThis task force will include an officer from NPD to ensure that development budget requirements\nare taken into account.\n4.\t Human Resource Management\n25. This subproject will focus on improving human resource management for the Sri Lanka\nPlanning Service and the Sri Lanka Accounting Service, as well as for officers working in NBD,\nPublic Finance Department, and Management Services Department (MSD) of MOFP. It will\nestablish a personnel record system, competency frameworks, and revised employment\nconditions, and examine a fast-track career planning system.\n26. Key activities will include the following:\n(i) prepare a diagnostic study of the personnel system operating for the Sri Lanka\nPlanning Service and Sri Lanka Accounting Service, and recommendations, if\nappropriate, of options for change in their management.\n(ii) develop and implement a human resource management plan for each service.\nThe plan will consider the strategies necessary to move staff to more\nperformance-orientated conditions of employment. It will be consistent with the\ncorporate plans developed in each department, including for MSD.\n(iii) design and implement a fast-track career planning program to ensure that\nplanning and financial management throughout the public service are managed\neffectively. The system will include an accelerated training program, a set of\nsecondments to expose trainees to a full range of requirements for a fully\neffective planning or accounting officer, and a mentoring scheme.\n(iv) develop MSD capacity, (e.g. through individual training, and improved processes\nand systems) to support the two service boards.\n(v) establish competency frameworks for core accounting, budgeting, and planning\npositions (including supporting indicative job descriptions).\n(vi) develop revised service conditions for the accounting and planning cadres\nconsistent with current employment practices in the Sri Lankan public service,", "7\nensuring that good staff are recruited and retained, and that positions are filled by\ncompetent officers.\n(vii) set establishment levels for all accounting and planning functions in the public\nservice based on the new systems introduced by other subprojects in this cluster\nTA.\n27. MSD will lead two task forces, one each for Sri Lanka Accounting Service and Sri Lanka\nPlanning Service, to work on designing and implementing human resource management plans\nfor the accountants and planning services. Each team will work closely with the teams\nimplementing the MTEF and PEIS. The team working on the plan for the accountants service\nwill be building on the training programs developed by the Financial Management Training\nProject. Close liaison will be maintained with the Ministry of Public Administration, Home\nAffairs, and Plantation industries.\n28. In addition to the lead officer from MSD, other members will be co-opted from each\nservice. Each team will include staff from the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of\nPublic Administration, Home Affairs, and Plantation Industries, either as a full-time member or\nas an observer and adviser.\n5.\t Revised Finance Act and Internal Audit\n29. An overall financial legislative framework will be developed under this subproject in\ncooperation with the Public Finance Department to strengthen the Government's financial\ncontrol over its programs and provide clear guidance to those with financial responsibilitk In\naddition, the internal audit function will be reinforced,\n30. Key activities will include\n(i) review the financial accountability mechanisms within government including the\neffectiveness of the Public Accounts Committee in its role of nonpartisan\noversight of agency efficiency and effectiveness; and development of a program\nto improve the effectiveness of the internal audit function;9\n(ii) prepare a set of manuals covering budgeting, accounting, administrative, and\nstores procedures to function under the authority of the financial regulations;\n(iii) review internal audit procedures and updating the Internal Audit Manual to\ninclude the improved procedures;\n(iv) draft an internal audit charter setting out the powers, duties, and responsibilities\nof the internal audit function;\n(v) publish a comprehensive set of financial regulations supporting the revised\nfinance act; and\n(vi) draft instructions for a revised finance act.\nThis work will, help to improve the quality of oversight over publicly-funded activities, as called for in the Bank's\nAnticorruption Policy (R89-98).", "8\n31. MOFP will staff three task forces to address each of the following (i) a revised finance\nact; (ii) a comprehensive set of financial regulations; and (iii) manuals covering budgeting,\naccounting, administrative, and stores procedures to be issued under the authority of the\nfinancial regulations.\n32. Each task force will be supported by domestic consultants working under the general\nguidance of an international consultant The task force on the revised finance act will consist of\nstaff from the Public Finance Department, the Attorney General's Department, the Office of\nAuditor General, and the staff of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for passage of the\nfinance act. The task forces on the financial regulations and the manuals will be extensions of\nthe present teams currently in process of revising the financial regulations.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n33. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3,765,000, comprising a foreign exchange cost\nof $2,077,000 and local currency cost of $1,688,000 equivalent. Detailed cost estimates and\nproposed financing arrangements are given in Appendix 2. The Bank will fund $3,000,000 to\ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and $923,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The\nfinancing will be provided on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA Program. The\nGovernment's contribution will be in kind and will cover items of expenditure estimated at\n$765,000 equivalent.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n34. MOFP will be the Executing Agency (EA). The TA subprojects will be implemented by\nfive departments within MOFP (Appendix 3). Each will assign counterpart teams to implement\nthe planned subprojects. The External Resources Department will facilitate the essential\ncoordination of activities, with the director general acting as TA director and liaising with the\nconsulting team leader. The consulting team and counterpart team for each subproject in the TA\ncluster will report to the director general concerned. At specific milestones (e.g., completion of\nthe IT strategy or the draft finance act would normally constitute a milestone), a workshop will\nbe held to review progress and determine further work. Senior MOFP personnel and officials\nfrom other key ministries will attend and offer guidance. Bank staff will be intensively involved in\nthe supervision and monitoring of the TA cluster to ensure proper implementation.\n35. The counterpart teams will be guided by an international consulting team that will\noperate in a facilitative mode, and be coordinated and directed by the team leader of the PEIS\nsubproject. The counterpart teams wilt be responsible for achieving the targeted outputs of each\nsubproject, other than very technical outputs (like the IT strategy), which will be prepared by the\nconsulting team. Study tours will serve the essential function of demonstrating to counterparts\nthe operation of successful PEM systems elsewhere, and learning from in-depth discussions\nwith the technicians responsible for implementing these systems.\n36. The five subprojects will include participatory workshops and study tours. A program of\ntraining courses will be developed to ensure that there is a pool of competent officers ready to\nfill each position in the accounting and planning functions. The Government will seek funding\nfor skills development from bilateral funding agencies like the Australian Agency for International\nDevelopment, which has a grant training program available for Sri Lanka. An option that will be\ndeveloped is a twinning arrangement joining an international training institution with at least two", "9\nSri Lankan training institutes10 to design and deliver training courses. The involvement of at\nleast two Sn Lankan institutes will introduce an element of competition to ensure that the\ncourses continue to be delivered effectively and meet MOFP's needs.\n37. The TA cluster will be implemented over a 36-month period starting in January 2000\n(Appendix 3). As the program must be responsive to MOFP's requirements and availability of\nkey staff, adjustments may be made to the implementation schedule. The budget is based on a\ntotal of 69 person-months of international consulting and 112 person-months of domestic\nconsulting. The consultants will be engaged by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the\nengagement of domestic consultants. A lead consulting firm (and possibly associated firms) will\nbe selected on the basis of a full technical proposal specifying effective methodologies to\naddress the outputs specified in Appendix 4. For quality control purposes, each subproject team\nwill have consultants from the lead firm or from associated firms that have core businesses in\ntechnical areas relevant to the subproject A phased-service agreement will be negotiated with\nthe firm to allow the flexibility required for a cluster TA. At important milestones, 11 progress will\nbe reviewed jointly by the Government and the Bank. Based on these reviews, indicative terms\nof reference in Appendix 4 will be further specified and adjusted as necessary.\n38. The consultants will prepare inception, interim, draft final, and final reports for each\nsubproject. The consultants will also assist in developing, and as appropriate, delivering\ninternational and domestic training programs, and act as resource persons in domestic\nworkshops to be organized in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.\nProcurement of equipment will be undertaken following the Bank's guidelines for procurement.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n39. The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri\nLanka in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 for the purpose of\nStrengthening Public Expenditure Management Systems.\n10 The training institutes to be considered will include the Institute of Public Finance and Development Accountancy,\nNational Institute of Business Management, Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration, and University of\nSri Jayawardenepura.\nMilestones will be determined by MOFP management when each subproject is planned in detail. The completion of\nthe IT strategy and the human resource management plan will certainly be two milestones. Other milestones will be\npoints in the program where decisions about future directions are to be made by MOFP management to enable the\nsubproject to progress.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
