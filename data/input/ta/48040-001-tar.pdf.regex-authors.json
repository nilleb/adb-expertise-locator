INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Armenia has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to improve its industrial and innovation policies. The TA was included \nin the country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Armenia.1 ADB approved the concept \npaper for the TA in September 2015. Following an ADB mission on 22\u201325 September 2015, an \nagreement was reached with the government on the outcome, scope, monitoring framework, \nfinancing  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  schedule  for  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Armenia\u2019s  economic  growth  during  2001\u20132008  was  remarkable,  with  annual  gross \ndomestic product growth averaging 11.9%. This growth brought Armenian income per capita in \nline with most other emerging economies. But the growth rate was not sustainable, and in \n2009\u20132014  annual  growth  slowed  to  an  average  1.1%.  During  the  boom  years,  a \ndisproportionate share of resources flowed to nontradable activities (e.g., construction sector), \nwhich crowded out other sectors, particularly exporting firms, many of which were displaced \nfrom world markets.3 Throughout most of the 2000s, Armenia went through a process of de-\nindustrialization, driven by a sustained real exchange rate appreciation fueled by easy access to \nexternal financing (remittances and credit). This structural de-industrialization was also a result \nof  the  lack  of  incentives  for  firms  to  invest  in  new,  nontraditional  economic  activities  and \novercome informational, financial, and technical barriers to exports. Important private sector \ncapabilities in industry and export activities were lost. The export share in gross domestic \nproduct declined from 29% (2001\u20132005) to 18% (2006\u20132009), before rebounding to 25% during \n2010\u20132014 supported by the significant exchange rate devaluation in March 2009.4 During \n2009\u20132013, Armenia experienced 0% growth in exports of new products to new markets.5 \nArmenia has become less diversified in its export basket and export destinations, and these \nexport connections are not easy to recover. This specialization structure limits the economy\u2019s \ngrowth potential. \n \n3.  Armenia has an established private sector manufacturing base, but many of its products \ncannot compete in international markets.6 In 2012 Armenian firms exported only 80 products \nwith comparative advantage.7 Armenia\u2019s export basket has become concentrated on minerals \nand nonprecious metal-related exports. Exports in just 15 product categories (out of the 786 \ncategories  in  the  four-digit  product  classification  of  the  Standard  International  Trade \nClassification) now represent 80% of Armenia\u2019s merchandise exports (footnote 5). Processed \nfood represents 17% of merchandise trade in Armenia.8 Many of these products are exported to \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

Report to the Government of Kazakhstan: Policies for Industrial and Service Diversification in Asia in \nthe 21st Century. Manila. \n8  The food and beverages production sector forms an important part of private sector activity in Armenia, with \nimportant backward linkages to agriculture activities. Armenian brandy has strong reputation in the Commonwealth \nof Independent States. \n ", "2  \nmembers of the Commonwealth of Independent States, where historical ties and migration flows \nhave built consumer awareness and distribution channels. Armenian products, however, remain \nlargely unknown to the rest of the world. \n \n4.  The financial sector in Armenia provides limited trade-related financial instruments, such \nas  export  credit  insurance  and  guarantees.  This  is  a  major  impediment  to  Armenian \nmanufacturers, impacting on their competitiveness and risk-taking when attempting to penetrate \nnew  export  markets,  since  they  are  unlikely  to  offer  supply  credit  terms  like  their  foreign \ncompetitors. In 2014 the government created the Export Insurance Agency of Armenia (EIAA) to \nprovide insurance to exporters based in Armenia against financial losses incurred as a result of \nnonpayment by foreign buyers of Armenian exported goods and services. The EIAA started its \ninsurance activities in May 2015 and its outreach so far has been limited. \n \n5.  Penetration  into  export  markets  is  important  for  firms  operating  in  scale-sensitive \ntradable activities. It is crucial in small and open economies like Armenia, as otherwise firms are \nnot cost-competitive and cannot compete with imports produced at a much larger scale. Firms\u2019 \nexport success is also dependent on how many other firms in the same country export the same \nproduct. This positive externality has justified the establishment of export promotion institutions \nin many countries. \n \n6.  The Armenian dram has been depreciating against the US dollar since the second half \nof 2014. The macroeconomic adjustment toward industry can be supported by the depreciation \nof the real exchange rate. However, for this adjustment to be sustained, manufacturing firms in \nArmenia need to overcome the scale-related cost disadvantages of a small domestic market. \nThis can be done by regaining market share in export markets and establishing footholds in new \nones, and by adopting a more diversified and risk-taking approach to innovation. \n \n7.  In 2011, the government adopted the Export-led Industrial Development Strategy, a set \nof initiatives to trigger dynamism in manufacturing sectors with export potential and directly \ntarget  export  growth  and  diversification  objectives.9 The  government  selected  11  strategic \nindustrial  subsectors:  brandy,  wine,  canned food,  water,  juices,  diamond  cutting, gold  and \njewelry,  watches,  precision  engineering,  pharmaceuticals,  and  textiles.  The  government  is \npreparing a new action plan to support the development strategy for 2016\u20132020. \n \n8.  In  December  2014,  the  government  established  the  Development  Foundation  of \nArmenia (DFA)\u2014by merging the Armenian Development Agency, the National Competitiveness \nFoundation  of  Armenia,  and  the  Industry  Development  Foundation\u2014to  be  responsible  for \nexport-led industrial policy. This improved institutional architecture can result in a more focused \nand coherent set of initiatives to pursue business competitiveness and export promotion. The \nDFA has been allocating funding for export promotion (about $1 million per year) and it plans to \nimprove its targeting in the coming years. \n \n9.  Under the country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Armenia, ADB aims to strengthen \nthe enabling environment for private sector development and help the private sector play a \ngreater role in export-oriented industry, trade, logistics, and infrastructure development.10 By \ntesting different instruments for industrial development, the TA will complement the ADB TA on \ninvestment promotion that is improving Armenia\u2019s capacity to bring committed investors to the \n                                                \n9  Government of Armenia, Ministry of Economy. 2011.

The outcome of both TA efforts will help identify policy areas that can improve \ngovernment support of business competitiveness, and thus be the basis of an ADB policy-based \noperation. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be growth in employment. The outcome will be improved industrial and \ninnovation policies in Armenia. The TA is aligned with the Armenia Development Strategy, \n2014\u20132025, which gives special importance to modern industrial and export promotion, with \ndirect interventions aimed at job creation.12 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will produce two outputs: (i) new institutional and policy instruments to promote \nexport-oriented industries and innovation piloted, and (ii) government\u2019s capacity to implement \nindustrial and innovation policies strengthened. \n \n12.  Output 1: New institutional and policy instruments to promote export-oriented \nindustries  and  innovation  piloted.  The  TA  will  design  and  pilot  policy  and  institutional \ninstruments that can support the export and innovation efforts of industrial firms based in \nArmenia. Some of the new instruments will improve targeting of government grant subsidies for \nfirm investments in market and product research needed for export discovery and exports of \nnew  and  more  sophisticated  products.  Pilots  can  be  designed  as  variable  matching-grant \nschemes that (i) induce firms' effort, risk-taking, and commitment to agreed export performance \ntargets  at  the  product  level;  (ii)  reward  success  (cofinancing  should  be  linked  to  export \nperformance, with appropriate sunset clauses); and (iii) incorporate regular monitoring and \ndialogue between participating firms and the government to effectively coordinate public actions \nwith firms that can take export discovery risks. The pilot instruments will target firms producing \ntradable goods and services based on past export performance but will exclude ADB-prohibited \ninvestment activities as listed in Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nfeedback mechanism of performance-based rewards will reinforce successful export attempts. \n \n13.  The TA will finance the cost of a senior advisor to the EIAA for market penetration of \nexport credit insurance among exporters and financial institutions in Armenia, product and \nunderwriting development, discussions on the regulatory treatment of credit insurance for capital \nadequacy, and advice on potential strategic partnership with an international credit insurer. The \nsenior advisor will participate in the meetings of the EIAA\u2019s supervisory board as a nonvoting \nmember. The DFA will explore links between the pilot mechanisms for export promotion (para. \n12) and the export credit insurance provided by the EIAA. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  finance  the  design  of  policy  and  institutional  instruments  to  support \ninnovation  efforts.  The  TA  will  finance  a  feasibility  study  for  possible  replication  of \ncomplementing existing initiatives that promote the development of innovation-oriented human \ncapital (e.g., the Tumo Center for Creative Technologies).13 \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to Armenia for Investment Promotion. Manila. \n12  Government of Armenia, Ministry of Finance. 2014. Armenia Development Strategy for 2014\u20132025.

Output 2: Government\u2019s capacity to implement industrial and innovation policies \nstrengthened.  The  allocation  of  resources  for  industrial  and  innovation  policies  and  their \ninstruments should be based on evidence and guided by a results framework.14 It should also \nbe  informed  by  an  international  trade  and  economic  competitiveness  assessment  and  by \nthorough industrial analysis that maps the local and global industrial landscape. This requires an \nupgrade in the economic analysis capabilities of the Ministry of Economy and its agencies. The \nTA will recruit experts to work with the Ministry of Economy and the DFA to expand the current \nresults framework for industrial and innovation policy. The TA will recruit a senior research \neconomist to assist the Ministry of Economy to design and implement an economic research \nprogram  that  helps  understand,  among  other  things,  which  Armenian  products  have  a \ncomparative advantage (e.g., product space analysis). The TA will finance the purchase of \nsoftware and databases for the implementing agencies for these purposes. \n \n16.  The main implementation risks will arise during the political process of reviewing and \ndeciding on the new institutional and policy instruments proposed by the TA. Political pressures \nfrom vested interests (e.g., firms currently benefiting from subsidies not targeting exports) may \nconstrain policy choices during implementation. Resistance to change in government agencies \nmay prevent implementation of the policy instruments proposed by the TA. The pilot instruments \nmay not receive sufficient funding from the government budget to enable a robust evaluation. \nThe TA will include communication activities to help mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $250,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund.15 The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, rental costs \nand interpretation services for workshops and seminars, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The  TA  is  expected  to  run  from  January  2016  to  December  2018.  The  Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Trade Division of the Central and West Asia Department of \nADB will administer the TA, and be responsible for the recruitment of consultants, procurement \nof goods and services, and all payments related to the TA. The Ministry of Economy will be the \nexecuting agency. The Ministry of Economy, the DFA, and the EIAA will be the implementing \nagencies. \n \n19.  ADB  will  engage  the  services  of  individual  consultants  and  resource  persons  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime) using individual consultant selection with biodata technical proposal. An estimated 23 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  needed,  of  which  11  person-months  will  be \ninternational and 12 person-months national (Table 1). Advance contracting will be used to \nrecruit the TA consultants. The outline terms of reference is in Appendix 3. ADB will finance the \npurchase of equipment required for the successful completion of outputs, including software and \ndatabases. Procurement will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). Any website(s) developed or enhanced under the TA will \n                                                \n14  EQuIP: Enhancing the Quality of Industrial Policies. http://www.equip-project.org/ \n15 Established by ADB.

The report will be published on ADB\u2019s website. \nThe blueprints (and smaller policy briefs) for each policy and institutional mechanism will be \npublished as knowledge products. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund, and \n(ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to the \nGovernment of Armenia for Export- and Innovation-Led Industrial Development, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned With \nPriority 1.
