THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $25,000,000 equivalent in Indian rupees to Suguna Foods Private Limited (Suguna) for the \nInclusive Poultry Value Chain Project in India. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Gender Capacity Enhancement in Poultry, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n \n2.  The project will support Suguna\u2019s expansion across 13 identified states in India with the \nconstruction  of  modern  feed  mills,  hatcheries,  environment-controlled  sheds,  and  meat \nprocessing lines; and the expansion of the company\u2019s contract farming program from 40,000 to \n55,000 smallholder poultry farmers. The TA will focus on building the farm management skills and \nfinancial literacy of 4,500 women contract farmers.1 The project will improve livelihoods and \ngender inclusion in rural areas, reduce malnutrition through the production of affordable proteins, \nand mitigate the impact of livestock farming on the environment and on climate change. \n   \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Importance of poultry in India. Livestock contributes about 5% to India\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct and nearly 12% to rural household income. As income per capita grows, the Indian \npopulation is shifting towards better nutrition in the form of high-protein diets, including meat. Of \nthe meat categories, broiler (chicken) meat is the fastest-growing segment in India because, \nunlike beef and pork, it is free of major religious associations. Globally, India is the fourth-largest \nbroiler producer, with an estimated output of about 5.1 million metric tons (t) in fiscal year (FY) \n2019, after the United States, Brazil, and the People\u2019s Republic of China. In addition, poultry is \nan  important  employer,  with  the  industry  (broiler  and  layer)  employing  nearly  30  million \nsmallholder farmers.2 \n \n4.  Malnutrition. India is home to the largest number of malnourished children in the world \nand about 40% of Indian children are undernourished. Poultry meat consumption in South Asia is \nonly about 20% of the intake prescribed by the healthy reference diet recommended by the EAT-\nLancet commission on food, planet and health.3 The development of poultry production can help \naddress these issues as poultry is one of the cheapest sources of animal protein and contains \nessential vitamins and minerals.4 \n  \n5.  Biosecurity risks. Poultry farms in India have traditionally been exposed to diseases, \nwhich have caused moderate losses. The first major avian flu incident in India, reported in \n \n1  The 13 states include Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, \nOdisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The number of women farmers trained could be \nincreased to 10,000, if additional TA funding is secured. \n2  Government of India, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare. 2017.

Willet et al. 2019. Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets for sustainable food \nsystems. Oslo. \n4  D. Farrell. 2013. The role of poultry in human nutrition. Poultry Development Review.   \nhttp://www.fao.org/3/i3531e/i3531e02.pdf  \n ", "2 \n \nFY2006, led to the culling of about 1 million birds.5 Since then, India has experienced about \n28 episodes of disease in some states, reported mostly by poultry farms to central government \nagencies. In all reported outbreaks, as per government policies, all birds in broiler farms within \nthe prescribed radius were promptly culled to prevent the disease from spreading. \n \n6.  Climate change impact. The livestock industry contributes to 14.5% of all human-induced \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; however, about 81% of that is attributable to ruminants, 10% \nto pigs and only 9% to poultry.6 Poultry farming is more efficient than cattle farming in producing \nanimal proteins because its feed conversion ratio is lower.7 Poultry also emits less GHGs than \ncattle because the digestion process does not emit methane. Finally, poultry farms consume less \nwater per unit of protein, leaving more water for irrigating crops. \n \n7.  Government policy alignment. To address the dual challenge of rural poverty and \nmalnutrition, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Government of India launched an ambitious program \nto double farmers\u2019 incomes by 2022 (footnote 3). The program envisages various steps to support \nagricultural  development,  including  subsidizing  interest  rates  for  poultry  farmers,  providing \nspecialized education and skill development and raising awareness of the nutritional value of \npoultry. The program aims to support farmers' livelihood diversification and income improvement \nand at the same time tackle the malnutrition challenge. \n \n8.  Project selection. Suguna is one of the largest agribusiness companies in India. The \nproject team considered Suguna a suitable candidate for Asian Development Bank (ADB) support \nbecause (i) its vertically integrated business across the poultry value chain allows it to be resilient \nto commodity price shocks; (ii) its strong track record of working with smallholder poultry farmers \nhas resulted in improved rural livelihoods; and (iii) it is willing to partner with ADB so it can \nenhance its environmental and social standards and strengthen gender participation across its \noperations and its contract farms. \n  \n2.  Project Design \n \n9.  The project will support Suguna\u2019s strategy of strengthening upstream integration to make \nthe business more resilient to commodity price shocks while scaling up the contract farming \nmodel. The project entails capital expenditure (capex) of $50.5 million during FY2020\u2013FY2022 to \nconstruct 20 feed mills, four environment-controlled sheds for breeders, eight hatcheries, and \nvarious meat processing lines.8 The TA will complement the capex plan by strengthening the \ncapacity of women for engagement as contract poultry farmers. \n \n10.  Improved  rural livelihoods.  Suguna  pioneered  contract  poultry farming  in India.  It \ncurrently works with 40,000 contract farmers across 19 states, particularly targeting smallholders \n(1 hectare or less).9 With Suguna\u2019s engagement, farmers are able to significantly increase their \npoultry income contributing to the the Government\u2019s National Action Plan of doubling farmers \n \n5  Code Partners Pte.

The subprojects to be funded are yet to be specified. \n9  Suguna is active in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya \nPradesh, Maharashtra, Mysore, Punjab, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, \nand West Bengal.  \n ", "3 \n \nincome.10 Farmers are supplied with all inputs, including day-old chicks, feeds, and medicine, and \nare responsible for rearing the chickens. These chickens are then lifted by Suguna and either sold \nlive via wet market or processed into chicken meat. Farmers are paid a fixed fee plus a \nperformance bonus per chicken for their services. This enables farmers to have much-needed \nincome  certainty  as  the  market  price  risk  is  borne  by  the  company.  Suguna  also  helps \nstrengthening the climate resilience of farmer livelihoods as poultry is more resilient to climate \nshocks than cropping. Suguna plans to work with 55,000 contract farmers by FY2025. \n \n11.  Increased gender participation. Suguna prefers to contract with poultry farms where \nboth husband and wife are engaged in the farm work, since it has observed positive outcomes\u2014\ngreater productivity and lower chicken mortality\u2014whenever women are involved. In the Indian \nrural context where safe and socially acceptable employment options for women are limited, \npoultry farming provides an important avenue to participate in a livelihood activity.11 With ADB\u2019s \nTA support, Suguna plans to train women on best practices in poultry farming and build their \nfinancial literacy. In addition, it aims to encourage women's employment in project operations. \n \n12.  Climate change mitigation and adaptation. Suguna\u2019s planned capex was designed to \noptimize a decentralized operations model whereby regional production infrastructure (feed mills, \nhatcheries, and environment-controlled sheds) is set up near raw material (corn and soya) \nproduction hubs and contract farmer clusters. The plan is part of the company\u2019s strategy to \ndiversify biosecurity risk and also drive down the large transportation costs associated with \ncentralized production. The company expects to lower the overall transportation distance by 14 \nmillion kilometers annually, saving about 3.27 million liters (or 2,740 tons) of fuel.12 As a result, \nthe project team estimated that at least 8,728 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions will be \navoided annually.13 Besides, the company and contract farmers are moderately exposed to the \nconsequences of climate change, as the farms are designed to mitigate the impact of changes in \ntemperature and rainfall. Although the adaptation benefits were not quantified, the project will \ncontribute to enhancing the climate change resilience of both the company and contract farmers.14 \n \n13.  Improved nutrition security and food safety. India\u2019s per capita consumption of broiler \nmeat is increasing but is still just 2.5 kilograms per annum, much lower than the world average \n(14.3 kilograms).15 The project will allow the company to increase annual production of live \n \n10 Each farmer participating in the Suguna contract farming scheme manages on average 5,500 birds and earns an \nincome of about $3.2/day from poultry alone. Poultry income typically constitutes 60%\u201370% of the income for these \nfarming households. Contract farmers are the backbone of Suguna\u2019s production operation. \n11 Suguna signs the vast majority (93%) of its supplier contracts with men because of the strong cultural norms \nassociated with the \u201cmale head of household.\u201d \n12 The decentralized production setup (project scenario) helps reduce the transportation distance associated with the \ncentralized production model (baseline scenario). In the baseline scenario, the project team assumed that a loading \ntruck would travel a greater distance from the central site to the regions where raw materials and clusters of farmers \nare located; in the project scenario, such facilities are in the same regions. \n13 Climate financing can be claimed for ADB investments that directly help mitigate GHG emissions. Of the total capex \nof $50.5 million, only investments related to feed mills ($28.4 million) are considered as climate finance since fuel \nsavings were the key driver for the decision to decentralize feed production. As ADB\u2019s funding share is about 49.5% \nof the total capex, about $14.06 million (49.5% of $28.4 million) is deemed climate finance. The total carbon avoided \nwas computed as the total volume of fuel saved multiplied by the net calorific value and emission factor of fuel. ADB \nguidelines suggest using a net calorific value of 0.043 terajoules per ton and a carbon emission factor of 74.1 tons \nof carbon dioxide per terajoule for diesel fuel (ADB. 2017. Guidelines for Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions of \nAsian Development Bank Projects: Additional Guidance for Clean Energy Projects. Manila.) \n14 Environment-controlled sheds protect the chickens from variations in temperatures and humidity. Further, the \ncompany\u2019s decentralized operations mitigate the risk of supply chain disruptions caused by extreme weather events \nthat affect long-distance transportation. \n15 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. OECD Data. https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-\nconsumption.htm (accessed 2 January 2020).  \n ", "4 \n \nchickens and poultry meat products from 1.0 million t to 1.8 million t over FY2020\u2013FY2025, giving \nabout 100 million consumers increased access to affordable animal protein. Further, Suguna\u2019s \nuse antibiotics for poultry under strict veterinarian prescription mitigates the risk of antimicrobial \nresistance and contributes to food safety.16        \n \n3.  Borrower \n \n14.  Suguna is India\u2019s largest broiler enterprise, with an annual production volume of 1 million \nt, turnover of about $1.3 billion (FY2019), and a broiler market share of 15%. Headquartered in \nCoimbatore (Tamil Nadu), the company is present in 19 states (footnote 11), employs about 8,000 \npeople (mostly in rural areas), and empowers more than 40,000 contract broiler farmers and more \nthan 200,000 corn and soybean farmers across rural India. Suguna is vertically integrated across \nparent breeding, hatchery operations, feed mills, broiler farming, and meat processing.  \n \n15.  Brothers  Bangarusamy  Soundararajan  (current  chairman)  and  Ganapathypalayam  \nBangarusamy Sundararajan (current managing director) established Suguna in 1984.17 They are \nfirst-generation entrepreneurs and have a strong background in agriculture. Suguna is 99.65% \nowned  by  Suguna  Holdings  Private  Limited  (Suguna  Holdings),  which  has  subsidiaries  in \nBangladesh, Kenya, India, and Sri Lanka. Suguna carries the group\u2019s India business and is the \nflagship company, contributing more than 95% (FY2019) to the group\u2019s revenue. Suguna is \nultimately owned by the founders\u2019 family through a trust, which owns 100% of Suguna Holdings. \nWhile no formal shareholder agreement exists, the four children of the founders were appointed \nas the beneficiaries of the trust through a written family governance deed.  \n \n16.  Suguna is a professionally run organization governed by its board of directors, which \nconsists of seven members and meets every quarter. To date, the board consists of four family \nmembers (the promoters and two of their children who are involved in the business), two \nindependent directors, and one employee director.  \n \n17.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence.18 Suguna\u2019s founders, shareholders, managers, \nand significant contracting entities do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant \nintegrity risk, since no unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other relevant information is \nrelated to them. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.19  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs  \n \n18.  Impact. The project is aligned with the Government of India\u2019s National Action Plan for Egg \nand Poultry up to 2022, in particular the goals of doubling farmers\u2019 income and preventing \nmalnutrition among children.20  \n \n \n16 Suguna has 16 senior veterinarians who work under the National Head of Health. Each veterinarian is placed in a \nregional head office and is responsible for covering branches in the region. In addition, Suguna maintains 16 regional \ndiagnostic labs and an advanced testing lab in Coimbatore to ensure proper diagnosis. Antibiotic use is only allowed \nwhen diagnostic labs have confirmed a bacterial infection and under strict prescription of the veterinarians.  \n17 Bangarusamy is the father of the two promoter brothers. In some South Indian families, family name is a prefix. \n18 ADB. 2015. Integrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10. Manila.  \n19 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n20 The project is expected to directly or indirectly impact the livelihoods of more than 1 million people in rural India, \nincluding poultry, corn, and soybean farmers; poultry traders; and their families. The project will also give about \n100 million consumers, including malnourished children, access to affordable animal protein. \n ", "5 \n \n19.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be a more inclusive and sustainable poultry value \nchain.  \n \n20.  Outputs. The outputs of the project are: (i) feed production capacity increased, (ii) poultry \nfarming capacity increased, (iii) poultry meat production capacity increased, (iv) the company has \nbecome more gender-equitable, and (v) women farmers trained in poultry farming techniques and \nfinancial literacy. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n21.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with \nStrategy 2030, which calls for ADB \u201cto scale up its financing for agribusiness\u201d and \u201cto promote \ngender equality in at least 75% of the number of ADB\u2019s committed operations by 2030\u201d.21 The \nproject is also consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, which \nsupports (i) increasing agricultural productivity and rural incomes, (ii) reducing the rural\u2013urban \nincome gap, (iii) doubling farm incomes within 5 years, and (iv) promoting gender equity.22 \n \n22.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 5 (Promoting Rural Development and \nFood Security, 2019\u20132024) , which calls for (i) direct support to private agribusiness clients linking \nsmallholder farmers to markets; (ii) nonsovereign financing for sponsors across the food value \nchain  focusing  on  quality  standards  and  traceability;  (iii)  the  production  of  sufficient,  safe, \nnutritious,  and  affordable  food  for  urban  and  rural  consumers;  and  (iv)  the  reduction  in \nagriculture\u2019s contribution to GHG emissions through improved farming and livestock practices.23 \nThe project is also aligned with Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 2 (Accelerating \nProgress in Gender Equality, 2019\u20132024), which seeks to expand \u201coperations in support of \nagribusiness value chains whereby women\u2019s jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities will be \nenhanced in higher value-generating activities.\u201d24 The project will also complement two upcoming \nsovereign agribusiness value chain projects in India.25  \n \n \nD.

The \nframework \nFood Safety and Standards Authority of India governs animal processing.  \nSuguna has a project team of 25 members, led by the company\u2019s project head, who reports to \nManagement \nthe managing director and has more than 20 years of project management experience. \nImplementation \nThe project will be implemented from FY2020 to FY2022.   \nperiod \nConstruction arrangements include civil, mechanical, electrical, and utility works. Suguna\u2019s \nprocurement policies and practices are compliant with ADB\u2019s procurement policies for private \nsector  companies.  For  every  project  site,  a  four-member  team  oversees  the  work \nConstruction \narrangements, before taking  an operational role after project commissioning. Each project \narrangements \nteam conducts a weekly review to ensure continuous progress monitoring. These reviews \ninvolve on-site employees, project managers, the project head, and the managing director on \na monthly basis.  \nSuguna has developed its own poultry breed housed in environment-controlled sheds. It \nproduces day-old chicks in its hatcheries and provides them to contract farmers for rearing. \nOperations \nThe farmers are given poultry feed, vaccination, and monitoring support. Chickens are then \narrangements \nlifted by Suguna and either sold live in the local wet markets or processed and then sold to (i) \nbusinesses and/or (ii) retail consumers through supermarkets and retail stores.  \nPerformance  Suguna will report annually on financial and operational KPIs for the group and the project, \nmonitoring  and on safeguard and development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FY = fiscal year, KPI = key performance indicator.   \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Suguna Foods Private Limited. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n[Redacted] \n \nG.  Unique Features \n \n24.  The project is ADB\u2019s first assistance to an inclusive poultry business in India.27 In the \nIndian context, poultry farming has unique impacts on rural livelihoods and nutrition. In addition, \nSuguna is committed to strengthening gender mainstreaming in this important livelihood activity, \nand ADB will be providing TA to support this initiative (para. 35). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB  will  provide  to  Suguna  a  long-term  senior  secured  corporate  loan  of  up  to \n$25,000,000 equivalent in Indian rupees. The loan has a tenor of 7 years with a grace period of \n2 years. The main terms and conditions of ADB\u2019s proposed loan have been agreed with Suguna. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB assistance will add value on three fronts. \n(i)  Gender action plan. ADB will help Suguna implement a gender action plan to \nincrease women\u2019s inclusion in employment opportunities, and increase the number \nof women contract farmers, through training supported by ADB\u2019s TA (para. 35).  \n \n27 The project is classified as an \u201cinclusive business\u201d project because more than half of its beneficiaries (Suguna\u2019s \nemployees and contract farmers) belong to the \u201cbase of the pyramid\u201d (bottom half of the income pyramid) in India. \n ", "7 \n \n(ii)  Safeguard  best  practices.  ADB  will  help  Suguna  implement  an  enhanced \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) following ADB\u2019s policies and \nbest  industry  practice  on  biosecurity,  animal  waste  management,  and  other \nsafeguards areas, and will monitor progress during project implementation.  \n(iii)  Diversified  funding  base.  Suguna  has  financed  its  growth  primarily  through \ninternally  generated  cash  flow  and  loans from local  commercial  banks.  ADB\u2019s \nfinancing will give Suguna\u2019s business a stamp of approval to further attract long-term \ncapital and partnerships from international sources. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[Redacted] \n \nD.  Technical Assistance  \n \n27.  The proposed TA of $190,00028 which will be financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-Others), will focus on training rural women in: (i) poultry farming's best \npractices and (ii) functional financial literacy. The TA\u2019s output will be training of 4,500 rural women \nby  FY2022.  Suguna  will  assist  in  farmer  identification  and  selection  and  provide  in-kind \ncontribution in the form of training venue, transportation, and accommodation. The TA will help fill \nthe gender capacity gap in poultry farming in rural India. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n28.  ADB categorized the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C)  and \nindigenous peoples (category C).29  \n \n29.  ADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts \nof the project. Approvals of site establishments and operations, as well as standard operating \nprocedures are contingent on measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse \nimpacts, as outlined in the due diligence report and its corrective action plan. The environmental \nand social measures and Suguna\u2019s commitment to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental \nimpacts are deemed adequate. \n \n30.  Environmental and social audit findings and recommendations. An external third \nparty conducted a corporate audit in accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) in relation to general corporate finance. Audits will be carried out prior to ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement for each subproject. The corporate audit found no reportable environmental, health, \nand  safety  incidents  but  observed  gaps  in  compliance  with  statutory  requirements  on \nenvironmental monitoring, specific permits at operation stage, and waste management. The \nproject is not expected to result in physical or economic displacement of people. The land for the \naudited facilities is leased, obtained through inheritance or purchased from private owners via \nwilling buyer, willing seller agreements. Suguna assessed the suitability of land for purchase, \nopting for industrial or agricultural land, and ensured lack of encumbrances through internal legal \nexamination of records and titles. Land acquisition required for subprojects will be via negotiated \n \n28 The TA could be scaled up to $385,000 to train 10,000 women farmers, depending on availability of funding. \n29 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "8 \n \nsettlement under willing buyer, willing seller arrangements. No impacts on indigenous peoples \nare envisaged. Suguna\u2019s facilities are in agricultural or industrial zones and not in tribal areas.  \n \n31.  While Suguna does not have a formal ESMS, it has standardized operation procedures \ncovering environmental, health, and safety aspects primarily in relation to waste and chemical \nmanagement, and occupational health and safety; but none for social matters. Suguna has \nagreed to (i) develop and implement an ESMS in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements; (ii) build capacity to implement the ESMS and recruit a senior environment and \nsocial manager; (iii) develop a formal process to screen, categorize, plan and review future ADB-\nfunded subprojects in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement; (iv) develop formal procedures \nand templates to identify environmental and social risks and impacts; (v) enhance monitoring and \nreporting requirements and implement compliance assurance measures; (vi) develop stakeholder \nengagement and information disclosure procedures as per the Safeguard Policy Statement; (vii) \ndevelop a grievance redress mechanism; and (viii) provide environmental, social, health, and \nsafety training to staff and relevant third parties to ensure the implementation of the ESMS. These \nand other audit recommendations have been agreed in a corrective action plan for the project.  \n \n32.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), Suguna incorporated measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. \nKey features of the gender action plan are steps to increase the number of supply contracts with \nwomen poultry farmers; have women employed at management level in project operations for the \nfirst time; increase the share of females employed in project operations; develop and implement \nguidelines aimed at increasing the share of women hired, retained, and promoted; train at least \n4,500 women in poultry farming's best practices and in financial literacy; and provide sex-\nsegregated toilets and change facilities at all project sites. Suguna will submit periodic reports on \nits implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n33.  Suguna will (i) apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments \nusing ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and \nregulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an ESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement. \nThe ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor laws and \nmeasures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001).30 The ESMS will also contain requirements, as applicable, for \ninformation disclosure and consultation with affected people following ADB requirements. Suguna \nwill report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken.31 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n34.  Suguna was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
