It is in substantive terms \na continuation of DPSPs 1\u20133, the programmatic series of annual \nsingle-tranche  operations  from  2005  to  2007.  The  DPSP \nseries\u2014cofinancing the Development Policy Loan (DPL) series \nsupported by the World Bank and the Government of Japan\u2014is \nembedded  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  National \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJM)  for  2004\u20132009.  It  supports  the \nRPJM\u2019s  broad  goals  of  stimulating  higher  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth  with  lower  levels  of  unemployment  and \npoverty, in three core areas: (i) investment climate, (ii) enhanced \npublic  financial  management  and  governance,  and  (iii)  public \nservice delivery to the poor. The DPSP-4 is also proposed as a \nsingle-tranche  operation  based  on  completed  actions \ndemonstrating  satisfactory  progress.  It  builds  on  reforms \nundertaken during past DPSPs and sets the groundwork for an \nexpanded policy dialogue for future operations. \n   \nRationale  In addition to the economic rationale mentioned above, the DPL \nseries  aims  to  harmonize  policy  reform  support  from  key \ndevelopment  partners.  The  involvement  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the DPL process effectively builds \non  and  deepens  sector-specific  reforms  supported  by  ADB \nthrough  its  past,  ongoing,  and  planned  operations  under  the \nIndonesia country strategy and program 2006\u20132009. \n \nADB\u2019s participation in the DPL also stems from its endeavors to \nreduce transaction costs for its developing member countries. \nThe  approach  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  as \noutlined in the long-term strategic framework and the middle-\nincome  country  initiative.  Participation  in  the  DPL  helps \nimplement and fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the Rome Declaration \non Harmonization (February 2003) and the Paris Declaration on \nAid Effectiveness (March 2005). ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the DPSP-4 will be in the form of higher economic \ngrowth that is sustained over the medium term, and lower levels \nof poverty and unemployment. Its principal outcome is improved \noverall economic management anchored on good governance \nthrough (i) an investment climate, (ii) improved public financial \nmanagement and good governance, and (iii) improved delivery \nof public services.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  For the DPSP-4, the Government has requested ADB to provide \na loan of $200 million. The DPSP-4 provides parallel cofinancing \nfor the World Bank-supported fifth DPL (DPL-5), for which the \nGovernment has requested $750 million. The Government also \nintends to request parallel cofinancing of $100 million from the \nGovernment of Japan for the DPL-5. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  single-tranche  program  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum; \nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the \ndraft  Loan  Agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions as \nare set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \nDisbursement  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n   \nProgram Period  The  program  implementation  period  for  the  DPSP-4  is  from \nJanuary  to  December  2008  and  the  loan  amount  will  be \ndisbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon  declaration  of  loan \neffectiveness. All actions included in the policy matrix have been \nimplemented within the year. The DPSP-4 fits within the overall \nreform agenda supported under the DPLs, which cover 2003\u2013\n2008. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs \n   \nProcurement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will \nbe disbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No \nsupporting import documentation will be required if, during each \nyear  when  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the \nvalue  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed ", "  iii\nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater \nthan the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  The key benefits expected from the DPSP series are (i) progress \nBeneficiaries  toward  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  improved \ninvestment  climate,  reduced  corruption,  and  improved \ngovernance; (ii) raising the profile of key issues at the ministerial \nlevel, accelerating the timetable for policy actions to be taken, \naddressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic  bottlenecks,  and \nproviding an impetus for decision makers to coordinate further \nacross  economic  and  line  ministries;  (iii)  institutional \ndevelopment  within  government  institutions,  Bank  Indonesia, \nand banks; (iv) greater public confidence in the banking system \nstemming from implementation of the deposit protection scheme; \n(v)  sustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment on the direction and content of, and strategies for, \nits economic, structural, and institutional reform agenda\u2014with \nthe DPSP-4 providing for policy continuity and consistency in \nsectors where ADB has been actively involved; (vi) facilitation, \nthrough crosscutting reforms, of sector-specific reforms in areas \nwhere  ADB  is  providing  or  planning  support;  and \n(vii) harmonization and parallel financing by the key development \npartners (ADB, World Bank, and Government of Japan) around a \ncommon  policy  framework  and  dialogue,  and  the  resulting \nendorsement of the Government\u2019s sound policy implementation \nand macroeconomic management. \n \nRisks and Safeguards  Implementation of the DPSP series is subject to the following \nrisks:  \n(i)  External  vulnerabilities.  With  improvements  in  its \nmacroeconomic  indicators,  Indonesia\u2019s  resilience  to \nexternal  shocks  has  increased.  Factors  limiting  the \npotential impacts of external shocks include diversity of \nexports, limited external debt exposure, and an adequate \nlevel  of  reserves.  The  banking  sector  is  also  now \nsufficiently strong to weather a moderate external shock. \nThe  maintenance  of  a  financial  sector  safety  net \nsupported  by  the  DPL/DPSP  will  help  to  improve  the \nresilience  of  the  banking  sector.  However,  significant \nsubsidies  continue  in  fuel  and  electricity,  despite  the \nGovernment\u2019s decision to raise fuel prices by 28.7% in \nMay 2008. There is a risk of an adverse market reaction \nto growing expenditures on energy subsidies. Indonesia \nhas considerable gross financing needs and the cost of \nmeeting these will almost certainly go up if outlays on oil \n ", "iv   \nsubsidies and budgetary financing needs continue to go \nup.  In  such  an  environment,  a  sharp  deterioration  in \nglobal  economic  conditions  could  make  Indonesia \nparticularly  vulnerable  to  sudden  shifts  in  investor \nsentiment, possibly triggering rapid capital outflows and \nraising the risks of broader financial sector disruption.  \n(ii)  Fiduciary  constraints.  Notwithstanding  the \nimprovements under way, there are continuing concerns \nregarding  utilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall \nfiduciary assessments undertaken since 2001 (with the \ncountry  financial  accountability  assessment)  have \nindicated  considerable  improvements  in  the  overall \nfiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia.  Ongoing  programs \nsupported  by  several  development  partners  provide \nsignificant  technical  assistance  support  to  strengthen \nfiduciary governance. The DPL/DPSP focus on improving \nbudget  preparation,  execution,  and  transparency  in \nfinancial  management  will  significantly  enhance \ntransparency.  \n(iii) The  2009  legislative  and  presidential  elections. \nAlthough  the  Government  remains  committed  to \nsustaining its economic reform agenda despite the global \neconomic  slowdown  and  general  elections  next  year, \nelections often reduce the time horizons of politicians, \nleading  them  to  avoid  new  policy  initiatives  in  the \npreelection  period  and  shifting  their  focus  to  populist \nshort-term measures. This could undermine the reform \nagenda contained in the DPSP-4. There is, however, also \nthe  possibility  of  a  countervailing  tendency  where  the \nprospect  of  approaching  elections  spurs  political \nentrepreneurs  into  more  clearly  establishing  reform \ncredentials and recording clear accomplishments. \n(iv) Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from \nsectarian and regional conflicts and terrorism could slow \nforeign  direct  investment  and  set  back  the  recovering \ntourism industry. The Government and law enforcement \nauthorities have taken a range of measures aimed at \nrebuilding public and investor confidence. \n \n \n \n ", "                          \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Fourth Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-4). The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE CONTEXT \nA.  Macroeconomic Developments \n2.  Ten years after the Asian financial crisis and domestic political turmoil, Indonesia has \nemerged economically stronger, more democratic, and increasingly resilient to both internal and \nexternal shocks. In the past 5 years in particular, the country has performed impressively in \nterms of macroeconomic management and political stability has become more entrenched, as \nthe democratic process has deepened and achieved wider acceptance. Progressively higher \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth has led since 2005 to per capita real GDP exceeding \nprecrisis levels. Prudent macroeconomic management has resulted in lower budget deficits, a \nmuch lower debt\u2013GDP ratio, and manageable inflation, until recently. The financial sector has \nlargely recovered from the 1998 crisis and market sentiment appears largely positive. Exports \nare at record levels, the balance of payments position is strong, and foreign reserves are at \nhistoric highs. In addition, investment, while still low by historical standards, is rising fast. \nDespite the current global economic slowdown, real GDP accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3% \nin  2007.  However,  recent  growth  has  not  translated  into  commensurate  increases  in \nemployment and reductions in poverty, and nearly half of the population remains vulnerable to \npoverty. The challenge is to build on the foundations of macroeconomic and social stability; and \naccelerate growth to reduce unemployment, poverty, and overall levels of vulnerability.  \n \n3.  To achieve these objectives, the Government is pursuing a pro-growth agenda while \npushing forward on broad structural and institutional reforms. Progress has been made on all \nfronts, albeit unevenly in some areas. Despite recent improvements, there is a continued need \nto  improve  the  investment  climate,  public  financial  management,  and  service  delivery \nmechanisms  to  the  poor.  The  DPSP  series  has  allowed  the  Government  to  work  with \ndevelopment partners in a flexible manner to implement critical high-level macroeconomic and \ncrosscutting sector reforms that address constraints to growth and poverty reduction while \nproviding predictability of financial support. As such, its coverage is fairly broad. Governance is \na recurring theme throughout the DPSP series, as it aims to promote transparency in all its core \npolicy areas. The proposed DPSP-4 is anchored in the country strategy and program (CSP) of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), 1  which  in  turn  provides  for  deeper  sector-level \ninterventions to complement the macroeconomic and governance reforms supported through \nthe DPSP series. The DPSP-4 builds on past DPSP operations to support the Government \nfurther  on  key  reform  measures  in  the  core  areas  of  investment  climate,  public  financial \nmanagement and anticorruption, and service delivery to the poor.  \n \n4.  Sustained  Macroeconomic  Performance.  Indonesia\u2019s  growth  performance  has \nremained strong, despite a deteriorating global environment. Having recorded its highest growth \nrate in a decade of 6.3% in 2007, the growth momentum was sustained at 6.4% during the first \nsemester of 2008. The main drivers of growth were private consumption, and gross fixed capital \nformation, including a sharp rise in foreign direct investment. While still below precrisis levels, \n                                                 \n \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009): Indonesia. Manila. ", "2   \ninvestment has steadily increased from 19% of GDP immediately after the crisis to 25% of GDP \nin 2007. Encouragingly, since 2007 investment growth has been dominated by a sharp increase \nin plant and machinery, auguring well for future production capacity.  \n \n5.  Despite the global economic crisis, Indonesia\u2019s macroeconomic fundamentals held up \nreasonably well during the first 8 months of the year. Indonesia\u2019s balance of payments remained \nin strong surplus in 2007, with the current account recording a surplus of 2.5% of GDP. Exports \njumped by 31% during the first 6 months of 2008 because of higher commodity prices and \nvolume growth. However, reflecting strong domestic consumer and investment growth, imports \nmore than doubled during this period, resulting in a small deficit in the current account in the \nsecond quarter of 2008. Foreign direct investment continued to remain strong during this period \nand reserves were at an all-time high of $60.5 billion at the end of July 2008, before moderating \nto $50.6 billion by end-October, as the Government attempted to stabilize the rupiah amid the \nglobal financial turmoil (para. 9). However, public debt has continued to fall as a share of GDP \nto below 35% in 2007 and is likely to approach 30% in 2008. Total external debt is also falling, \nmost likely to be a little below 30% of GDP in 2008. The budget deficit remains moderate \ndespite significant changes in the underlying parameters (para. 7).  \n \n6.  Like its neighbors, Indonesia\u2019s inflation has risen sharply since the beginning of the year, \nto 11.8% year-on-year in October 2008. While much of the increase in inflation has been \nattributed to higher food prices2 (food items accounting for nearly 40% of the consumer price \nindex), a 28.7% increase in administered fuel prices in late May 2008 added to subsequent \ninflationary pressures both directly and indirectly through generalized price setting. To address \nsuch pressures, Bank Indonesia has gradually tightened monetary policy by a series of 25 basis \npoint increases in interest rates that have led to its policy rate increasing from 8.0% in May 2008 \nto 9.5% in October 2008. \n \n7.  Indonesia\u2019s fiscal performance has remained strong despite pressure from increasing \nenergy subsidies. Energy (fuel and electricity) subsidies rose to 3% of GDP in 2007. The fiscal \ndeficit was, however, contained at 1.3% of GDP, slightly below the deficit of 1.5% projected in \nthe revised budget. Energy subsidies increased sharply in 2008 as the oil price assumption in \nthe budget was raised from an original $60 to $95, and then again to $110 per barrel. After oil \nprices passed the $110 per barrel threshold, the Government raised regulated fuel prices by an \naverage of 28.7% in late May. It is applying part of the saving to fund an unconditional cash \ntransfer that offsets rising food costs for 70 million of the country\u2019s poor and near-poor. The \nGovernment is using most of the remainder to reduce this year\u2019s budget deficit. The oil price \nhike in May, combined with the recent decline in international oil prices, has helped contain \nenergy subsidies in 2008. Most of these subsidies are highly regressive\u2014the richest fifth of \nhouseholds directly receive as much as two-thirds of Indonesia\u2019s fuel subsidy. Higher levels of \nfossil fuel subsidies also create a disincentive to invest in renewable sources of energy and \nenergy efficiency measures, producing a detrimental impact on the environment. A few selected \nfood and agriculture items are also subsidized, but such outlays account for a relatively small \nshare of total subsides. The real cost of the subsidies is the lost opportunity to invest increased \noil and gas revenues in the higher priority social and infrastructure areas, needed to sustain \nIndonesia\u2019s  longer-term  growth  and  development  objectives.  In  2008,  development \n                                                 \n \n2  Rice had been the exception. Import restrictions in 2005 and 2006 left domestic rice prices almost 50% higher than \ninternational prices in late 2007. As a result, when international rice prices started rising in early 2008, the price of \nrice in Indonesia did not rise in parallel. However, the continued sharp increases in global rice prices reversed this \nrelationship and domestic rice prices started rising again. ", "  3\nexpenditures\u2014comprising capital and social spending\u2014are projected to amount to 2.8% of \nGDP, slightly below the 2007 level. The Government is well aware of the need to reduce the \ncost of fuel subsidies and has indicated that steps will be taken in the future to address this \nissue.  Efforts  are  under  way  to  contain  subsidized  fuel  consumption  by  possibly  capping \npurchases of subsidized fuels to certain amounts and to replace heavily subsidized kerosene \nwith the more economical LPG as the main cooking fuel. The proposed budget for 2009 also \nintroduces other  measures  such  as  sharing  the  cost  of  energy  subsidies  with  subnational \ngovernments, and linking domestic fuel prices with international prices when prices exceed a \ncertain threshold. The latest tentative projections for 2008 indicate a deficit of about 1.2%, lower \nthan the 2.1% deficit indicated in the revised budget (Table 1). This in part is based on buoyant \nrevenue performance and expenditure savings.  Revenues are likely to exceed targets by \naround 5.0% reflecting improved tax administration, and an increase in oil production and \nconsequent rise in oil revenues.  Expenditures are likely to come in below the budgeted levels \ndue to reduced oil subsidies on account of the recent decline in oil prices, and a 10% cut in \nroutine Government expenditures. \n \nTable 1: Central Government Budget \n(% of GDP) \n2006  2007  2008  2008  2009 \n(revised)  (outlook)  (agreed \nem  budget) \nRevenues  19.1  17.8  20.0  20.3  18.5 \n Non-oil domestic tax  10.6  10.8  11.7  11.3  - \n  o/w Income tax  5.0  4.9  5.6  5.4  - \n  o/w VAT  3.7  3.9  4.4  4.2  - \n Oil and gas  6.0  4.3  5.3  6.6  - \n Other  2.5  2.9  2.9  3.1  - \nExpenditures  20.0  19.1  22.1  21.5  19.5 \n Central Government  13.2  12.8  15.5  15.2  - \n  Materials  1.4  1.4  1.5  1.4  - \n  Interest payments  2.4  2.0  2.1  2.0  1.9 \n  Subsidies  3.2  3.8  5.2  5.8  3.1 \n  Social assistance  1.2  1.3  1.3  1.2  - \n  Capital  1.6  1.6  1.8  1.6  - \n Transfer to regions  6.8  6.4  6.5  6.3  6.0 \nPrimary balance  1.5  0.8  0.0  0.8   \nOverall balance  (0.9)  (1.3)  -2.1  -1.2  -1.0 \nNet financing  0.9  1.1  2.1  1.3  1.0 \n Bonds  1.1  1.4  2.6  1.9  1.0 \n Official finance  (0.8)  (0.6)  -0.3  -0.3  -0.2 \nAssumption           \n Exchange rate (Rp/$)  9141.0  9419.0  9100.0  9435.0  9400.0 \n Oil price ($/bbl)  64.0  78.0  95.0  101.72  80.0 \n( ) = negative; bbl = barrel; GDP = gross domestic product; o/w = of which; VAT = value \nadded tax. \nSource: Ministry of Finance \n \n \n8.  Notwithstanding moderate fiscal deficits, Indonesia\u2019s gross borrowing needs during the \nnext  2  years  remain  high  because  of  high  levels  of  domestic  and  foreign  debt  principal \nrepayments (Table 2). Given that these financing needs coincide with higher domestic and \ninternational borrowing costs, program loans from development partners provide a preferred \ncontribution to Indonesia\u2019s overall financing needs. In 2008, ADB will provide the Government \n ", "4   \nwith $830 million in program loans, while the Government of Japan will provide $500 million and \nthe World Bank a further $1,600 million in budget support (amounting to $900 million in program \nloans and a further $700 million in budget support utilizing country systems). \n \nTable 2: The Government\u2019s Gross Financing Needs, 2005\u20132009 \n(Rp trillion) \nItem  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nGross financing  63.9  105.4  142.2  161.6  172.6 \nOverall deficit  7.1  29.1  49.8  59.2  52.7 \nTotal amortization  56.8  76.3  92.4  99.6  106.5 \n- In rupiah  19.7  23.6  34.4  38.6  44.8 \n- In foreign currency  37.1  52.7  57.9  61.0  61.6 \nNotes:           \nGross financing ($ billion)  6.6  11.5  15.5  17.5  18.4 \nRp/$  9,751.0  9,141.0  9,164.0  9,257.0  9,400.0 \nSource: Ministry of Finance.           \n \n9.  The global economic turmoil has had a significant impact on Indonesia. The structure of \nIndonesia\u2019s financial sector and exports would have, however, suggested that the country was \nbetter equipped than some of its neighbors to confront the current downturn. The banking sector \nhad limited direct exposure to developments in the United States financial markets, low reliance \non  external  financing, and  had  low  levels  of  nonperforming  loans  (3.4%)  and  high capital \nadequacy ratios (17.1%) in August 2008. Indonesia\u2019s trade share at 50% of GDP is also \nrelatively  small,  while  the  structure  and  destination  of  its  exports  potentially  offered  some \nprotection to its external sector from the global slowdown. Almost two-thirds of Indonesia\u2019s \nexports are commodities, whose prices had remained strong for much of the year. Indonesia\u2019s \nexports have also been increasingly moving toward economies in Asia and away from the US \n(12.3% of total exports in 2007) and European Union (14.5% of total exports in 2007). However, \nexport growth has moderated in recent months as commodity prices have weakened and the \nglobal economic outlook has deteriorated.  Domestic capital markets have also been subject to \nperiodic bouts of volatility since the beginning of 2008, and capital flight since October 2008. By \nthe end of September 2008, the Indonesian stock exchange had fallen by 33% since the start of \nthe year, and by 7 November the stock exchange had fallen by a further 27% from end-\nSeptember levels. A lower risk appetite for emerging market debt, higher domestic inflation, and \ntighter credit markets have adversely affected sentiment, with spreads on Indonesian 5-year \ncredit default swaps increasing from 352.7 on 1 October 2008 to 1,256.7 on 23 October 2008, \nbefore  moderating  to  620.8  on  7  November  2008.  These  developments  have  impacted \nnegatively on government debt markets, with yields on government bonds having risen on \naverage by 1,021 basis points by end-October, before moderating to 609 basis points by 7 \nNovember 2008. The rupiah, which had remained broadly stable against the US dollar during \nthe first 9 months of 2008 has, however, continued to decline since end-September and has \ndepreciated by 18% as of 7 November 2008. \n \n10.  GDP growth is expected to moderate to 6.1% in 2008 and 5.2% in 2009, as export \ngrowth  and  foreign  direct  investment  slows  with  the  global  economic  downturn  (Table  3). \nGrowth during this period will be sustained by domestic consumption demand. However, the \npossibility of a prolonged and more severe slump in the global economy holds considerable \ndownside  risks  to  Indonesia.  A  sharper  slowdown  in  the  global  economy  and  continued \nturbulence in international financial markets would further affect demand for Indonesian exports \nand limit investment growth as credit markets tighten. Tighter credit markets and increased risk \naversion could also limit the Government\u2019s ability to tap international financial markets. This has ", "  5\nalready forced the Government to revise the 2009 budget to target a deficit of 1% of GDP.  The \nGovernment plans to do this by reducing routine line ministry spending by a further 5% to 15%, \nwhile maintaining infrastructure spending and scaling up social-sector spending, in particular for \nits flagship community-based poverty alleviation program.  The Government is considering \nvarious alternative budget financing modalities in view of the tightening financial markets.  \n \n11.  The Government has also announced a raft of policy measures to counter the effects of \nthe  crisis,  and  boost  liquidity  and  confidence  in  the  financial  system.  These  include  the \nrelaxation of reserve requirements for commercial banks and the use of central bank and \ngovernment  debt  as  secondary  reserves,  the  lowering  of  reserve  requirements  on  foreign \nexchange deposits, the extension of the tenor on foreign exchange swaps from 7 days to \n1 month, abolishing the limits placed on the daily balance position of short-term foreign loans, \nincreasing the ceiling on deposit insurance from Rp.100 million to Rp.2 billion, and easing rules \nfor  share  buybacks  for  companies  with  share  price  declines.  The  Government  has  also \nimplemented a regulation strengthening the legal basis and interagency coordination in dealing \nwith the financial crisis, including on decisions relating to injecting liquidity and whether to bail \nout troubled banks. In the real sector, the Government has provided various tax incentives for \ninvestment,  and  has  initiated  measures  to  accelerate  state  budget  disbursements  and \nprocurement (both areas supported by this program loan). \n \nTable 3: Indonesia Key Macroeconomic Indicators \n                  \nIndicator  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nReal GDP growth (%)  4.8  5.0  5.7  5.5  6.3  6.1 \nInflation (%; average of period)  6.8  6.1  10.5  13.1  6.4  10.3 \nM2 growth (%)  9.8  10.0  13.0  18.1  19.1  15.8 \nExternal debt (% of GDP)  57.7  53.5  46.6  35.5  31.7  28.4 \nOverall fiscal balance (% of GDP)  (2.0)  (1.4)  (0.3)   (0.9)  (1.3)  (1.2) \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  3.5  0.6  0.1  2.6  2.5  0.1 \nGross official reserves ($ billion)  36.3  36.3  34.7  42.6  56.9  50.0 \n  in months of imports  6.1  4.8  4.4  4.8  5.1  5.0  \n.                 \n( ) = negative; GDP = gross domestic product; M2 = Broad Money. \nSources: Bank Indonesia, Central Bureau of Statistics, ADB estimates \nB.  Social and Governance Context \n12.  Translating  Growth  into  Poverty  Reduction  and  Employment  Generation. \nIndonesia\u2019s poverty rate, measured with reference to the national poverty line, fell from 16.6% in \nMarch 2007 to 15.4% in March 2008. The decrease resumed the trend of gradually declining \npoverty rates since 2000, which had been interrupted in 2006 by a nearly 2 percentage point \nincrease caused by a sharp rise in rice prices. Both urban and rural poverty declined over the \ncourse  of  2007;  the  decline  was  spatially  quite  uniform,  with  even  the  poorest  provinces \nregistering decreases in their poverty rates. These levels of poverty, however, translate to about \n35 million poor people, while nearly half the population could be considered among the poor or \nnear-poor because their per capita consumption levels were less than one-third above the \nnational poverty line. These figures suggest that there is a very large group of near-poor in \nIndonesia who are highly vulnerable to shocks at all levels. The poverty profile in Indonesia still \nindicates considerable regional differences in poverty\u2014nine provinces have poverty rates of \nless than 10% (4.3% in Jakarta) while 10 provinces have poverty rates of more than 20% (37% \n ", "6   \nin Papua). A challenge for the Government is that, while the poverty incidence is far higher in \neastern regions, most of Indonesia\u2019s poor live in the densely populated and relatively more \nprosperous western regions. Indonesia\u2019s labor market may also be turning the corner and the \nphenomenon of \u201cjobless growth\u201d may be easing. The employment numbers from the latest \n(February  2008)  national  labor  force  survey  indicate  improvements  in  many  labor  market \noutcomes, continuing what appears now to be an improving trend since 2005. The employment \nrate, the share of the labor force with nonfarm employment, as well as the share with formal \njobs have all been rising, while the open unemployment rate has fallen to 8.5% in February \n2008 from 9.8% a year earlier. \n \n13.  Non-Income Millennium Development Goals. Indonesia\u2019s progress toward meeting \nother Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets is somewhat mixed. Malnutrition remains a \nsignificant  public  health  problem,  with  the  percentage  of  children  under  5  years  who  are \nunderweight rising from 24.6% in 2000 to 28.0% in 2005. This has been attributed in part to \ndecentralization in 2000, since the responsibilities for the previous highly centralized family \nnutrition programs were devolved to more than 400 districts. This created difficulties in planning, \nfinancing, and supervising these programs. On the MDG goal relating to education, Indonesia is \nwell on track to achieve the target in primary net enrollment, but it is falling behind in achieving \nnet  enrollment  in  lower  secondary  education.  In  relation  to  the  MDG  on  gender  equality, \nIndonesia is on track to achieve gender equality in education. The gender gaps in terms of net \nenrollment  rates  in  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  have  already  been  closed. \nMeasured in terms of labor market participation in the nonagricultural sector and seats in \nParliament, however, participation of women continues to lag behind that of men. Indonesia is \nalso on track to achieve the MDG target of reducing the under-5 mortality rate by two-thirds by \n2015, but progress in reducing the maternal mortality ratio has not been sufficient to meet the \nlevels targeted in the MDGs. While the country remains on track for achieving the targets for \nimproved drinking water, it is off track with regard to attaining the target on access to improved \nsanitation facilities. The country is severely off track in achieving the targets of reversing forestry \nloss. In most of the MDG-related indicators, sharp regional and socioeconomic differentials \nremain and progress in many instances remains less than has been achieved by the relatively \nmore advanced economies of Southeast Asia.  \n \n14.  Translating  Growth  into  Equity  and  Efficiency\u2014Progress  in  Governance. \nSubnational elections held over the past years have mostly been well run and peaceful, and \nhave often led to losses for incumbents, demonstrating the electorates\u2019 willingness to punish \npoor performance. At the national level, policy debate is often vigorous and political parties are \ndeveloping stronger identities. This political stability and public debate are proving conducive to \ngradually improving governance and economic growth that is more sustainable. Indonesia\u2019s \ngovernance indicators have improved markedly in recent years but there is still scope for much \nmore improvement, and despite recent advances, corruption remains a significant obstacle to \ndoing business. \n \n15.  Several high-profile cases led by the Corruption Eradication Commission anti-corruption \ncommission  (KPK)  are  advancing  the  Government\u2019s  corruption-fighting  credentials.  One \ninvolved the transfer of funds from Bank Indonesia to members of parliamentary committees to \ninfluence the passing of several bills, including one that would have transferred responsibility for \nsupervising the financial sector from Bank Indonesia to a separate agency. In a separate case, \nan attempt by senior members of a large conglomerate to influence the Attorney General\u2019s \noffice  has  seen  KPK  arrest  the  businesspeople,  and  many  attorney  generals  and  state \nprosecutors have been reassigned or dismissed. Various customs offices have been raided and \ncustoms officials arrested for suspect payments. In addition, regional government officials are ", "  7\nbeing prosecuted for corruption, such as one case of a protected mangrove area being rezoned \nfor a port development. \n \n16.  In  addition  to  pursuing  past  cases,  the  Government  is  also  gradually  introducing \nmeasures to prevent corruption. Senior public servants in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) may no \nlonger also hold senior positions in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Throughout the public \nservice, pay levels are being brought closer to the skill and responsibility of the position, and the \nprivate sector equivalents. Vacancies are being filled through internal advertisements rather \nthan automatic promotion. \n \n17.  Indonesia\u2019s democratic governance made major advances in 2004 with its first direct \npresidential election, and all indicators suggest that the national elections in 2009 will repeat \nthose achievements. Nevertheless, the 2009 elections increase the uncertainties surrounding \nthe conduct of policy over the next year, and its longer-term direction. On the one hand, the \nelection process could place on hold certain reforms with longer-term returns, or with high short-\nterm  costs  to  vocal  sectional  interests,  such  as  reducing  Indonesia\u2019s  very  large  energy \nsubsidies. On the other, more legislative measures may be passed as the preelection pressure \nmounts for the Government to demonstrate its achievements. \n \nIII.  GOVERNMENT STRATEGY, PROGRAM STRUCTURE, AND RESULTS \nA.  The Development Policy Support Program and Government Strategy \n18.  The DPSP supports the development policy agenda of the Development Policy Loan \n(DPL) series prepared by a joint team of the Government of Indonesia, ADB, Government of \nJapan, and the World Bank.3 The DPL series aims to help the Government achieve its medium-\nterm growth and poverty reduction objectives through three core policy areas: (i) improved \ninvestment  climate,  (ii)  improved  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and  (iii) \nimproved delivery of public services to the poor. Building on the support provided by the DPSP-\n3 (approved in December 2007), the proposed DPSP-4 will provide parallel cofinancing support \nto the Government to help implement reforms under the fifth Development Policy Loan (DPL-5), \nwhich is the fifth in a series of five annual, single-tranche loans. \n \n19.  The Government\u2019s national medium-term development plan (RPJM) aims to achieve \npeace and security, justice and democracy, while advancing the welfare of the people within the \ntime frame of 2004\u20132009. The RPJM includes the eight MDGs that provide an overarching \nframework, placing human development and poverty reduction at the center of the development \nagenda. The RPJM has set a number of social targets, some of which are more ambitious than \nthe MDGs. For example, it aims to halve the 2004 national poverty rate from 16.6% to 8.2% by \n2009. The Government\u2019s work plan (RKP), approved each year by the cabinet, guides RPJM \nimplementation. The RKPs set out annual development priorities, including quantitative targets \nand policy directions, which in turn provide a guide to aggregate budgetary allocations.4  \n \n                                                 \n \n3  As ADB did not participate in DPL-1, a different title\u2014DPSP\u2014has been adopted for ADB\u2019s operations. Thus, the \nequivalence is as follows: DPL-1 = ADB\u2019s participation through policy dialogue; DPL-2 = DPSP-1; DPL-3 = \nDPSP-2; DPL-4 = DPSP-3; and DPL-5 = DPSP-4. The proposed Program is in line with ADB\u2019s CSP 2006\u20132009 for \nIndonesia, which supports continued cofinancing of the DPLs. \n4  In an apparent recognition of the difficulty of attaining the poverty target, the 2009 RKP sets a target of reducing \nthe poverty rate to 12%\u201314% in 2009 from 15.4% in March 2008. \n ", "8   \n20.  The  RKP  for  2008  indicates  that  the  overall  development  theme  for  next  year  is \n\u201cAccelerated Economic Growth for Job Creation and Poverty Reduction\u201d. To address this overall \ntheme,  the  RKP  for  2008  has  the  following  eight  priority  areas:  (i)  increasing  investment, \nexports,  and  job  opportunities;  (ii)  revitalizing  agriculture,  fisheries,  forestry,  and  rural \ndevelopment;  (iii)  accelerating  development  of  infrastructure  and  improvement  of  energy \nmanagement; (iv) improving access and quality of education and health services; (v) improving \nthe effectiveness of poverty reduction measures; (vi) corruption eradication and accelerated \nbureaucratic reform; (vii) strengthening defense capabilities and improving domestic security; \nand (viii) disaster response, disaster risk reduction, and improvement of avian influenza control. \nOf these, the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth priority areas relate to the core policy areas of the \nDPSP-4. ADB\u2019s Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program addresses the priority area \nrelated to infrastructure5. \n \n21.  To help implement the RKP priorities, economic policy packages have been introduced \nin each of the last 3 years, from which specific measures are derived to be achieved within a \ndefined period. In 2006, the Government issued three economic policy packages covering \ninvestment climate, infrastructure, and financial sector reform. In 2007, a comprehensive follow-\nup package was issued detailing measures to accelerate development, and empower micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises. The latest package, introduced in May 2008, builds on the \nprevious packages and details reforms in the following eight areas: (i) investment climate; \n(ii) financial sector; (iii) energy security; (iv) natural resources, environment, and agriculture; \n(v) small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SME);  (vi)  implementation  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  commitments;  (vii)  infrastructure;  and  (viii) labor  policy. \nThrough these policy packages, the Government has demonstrated a clear willingness to deal \nwith a number of complex, and in some cases politically sensitive, issues that have been on \nhold for some time. Each policy package has time-bound actions and stipulates a minister to be \nresponsible for each item. The packages also represent a foundation for future DPL/DPSPs, \nwhich are envisioned to deepen the policy dialogue in select areas. The triggers for the DPSP-4 \ninclude several actions identified in the policy packages. \n \n22.  The DPSP Series, Other ADB Sector Programs, and Donor Harmonization. Support \nfor the RPJM through parallel cofinancing of the DPL series is a key pillar of ADB\u2019s CSP for \n2006\u20132009 (footnote 1). Under the CSP, a dual-track approach is adopted to ensure that the \nhigh-level macroeconomic and governance reforms supported through the policy dialogue of the \nDPL series complement, and are reinforced by, ADB\u2019s sector programs. Underpinning the policy \ndialogue has been a series of advisory technical assistance (TA) provided by the World Bank \nand ADB that the Government has drawn upon. Figure 1 presents the approach, which involves \nstructuring ADB\u2019s support through (i) participation in the DPLs to strengthen the macroeconomic \nand fiscal framework while addressing crosscutting concerns; and (ii) sector-specific policy \ninterventions in the areas of infrastructure, financial deepening, local government finance, and \npoverty reduction and accelerated progress toward the MDGs. ADB\u2019s dual-track approach aims \nto harmonize and align development partner strategies with Indonesia\u2019s country strategy and \npriorities. The participation of ADB and the Government of Japan in the World Bank-coordinated \nDPL series, and the participation of the Government of Japan and the World Bank in ADB\u2019s \nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program, have helped reduce the Government\u2019s \ntransaction costs of policy dialogue with three of the country\u2019s most important development \npartners.  Moreover,  development  partner  harmonization  around  the  Government\u2019s  own \n                                                 \n \n5 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (Subprogram 2). Manila ", "  9\nprograms has bolstered country ownership of the reform process and helped change the nature \nof the relationship with the three development partners to one of reliable collaboration. ADB\u2019s \nactive participation in the policy discussions in all areas of the DPL and the parallel policy \ndialogue on sector reforms have been particularly appreciated by the Government, as these \nhave helped in setting the overall macroeconomic framework for sector-level reforms supported \nby  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  these  policy  discussions  and  its  strength  in  the  areas  of \ninfrastructure, financial sector, decentralization, and support for achieving MDGs have helped \navoid duplication of effort and improved the monitoring as well as the quality of the triggers. \nB.  The Evolution of the Program \n23.  At its inception in 2004, the DPL series was designed to support Indonesia\u2019s transition \nfrom postcrisis stabilization to more long-term development. The DPL was expected to provide \nthe foundation for continued, medium-term policy engagement in the areas of macroeconomic \nstability, the investment climate, and public financial management and anticorruption. It also \nprovided for a flexible means of taking into account the pace and fluidity of the reform process. \nHence, as the program has evolved, the scope of the reform agenda has become broader. The \nbroadening of the agenda has also been accompanied by a deepening of reforms, whereby \nsuccessive DPL operations have built on previous ones to ensure incremental implementation. \nThe  theme  of  the  DPL-1  was  on  restoring  and  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and \nconsolidating macroeconomic achievements at a time when Indonesia was leaving its postcrisis \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  program.  Within  this  context,  the  main  focus  was  on \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  investment  climate,  and  public  financial \nmanagement and governance. The theme of the DPL-2/DPSP-1 progressed toward creating \nfiscal space. This led to themes more focused on implementation. The emphasis of the DPL-\n3/DPSP-2 was on utilizing the fiscal space that had been created in the DPL-2 to have a greater \nimpact on service delivery, while the theme of the DPL-4/DPSP-3 carried this further forward by \ndeepening the process of institutional reform Reflecting the flexibility of the program and the \nGovernment\u2019s success in achieving macroeconomic stability and attaining the macroeconomic \ntriggers of the DPL program ahead of time, the Government and development partners agreed \nin early 2006 to remove the macroeconomic pillar in the proposed DPL-4/DPSP-3, but to \ncontinue the policy dialogue on macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the increased fiscal \nspace  generated  by  the  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies,  declining  debt  service  payments,  and \nincreasing revenues had opened up opportunities for a greater focus on public service delivery \nas a new policy area (Appendix 2 provides the evolution of DPL/DPSP triggers). \nC.  Results Achieved \n24.  Policy  actions  under  the  macroeconomic  pillar  relating  to  debt  and  fiscal  policy \nmanagement  contributed  considerably  to  lower  levels  of  debt  to  GDP  and  a  considerable \nincrease in non-oil tax revenues6. Rating agencies have also cited debt reduction and the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to reforms, including changes to the investment law, customs and \ntax reforms, and fiscal reforms\u2014all activities supported by the DPL/DPSP\u2014as the reason for \nrecent sovereign rating upgrades. Policy actions supported under the investment climate have \nled to significant improvements in business start-up times, value-added tax (VAT) refund times, \nand have led to the establishment of a sounder and sustainable financial safety net. DPL/DPSP \n                                                 \n \n6  This section, and the subsequent section on Lessons, is based on the findings of a program completion report \nundertaken for the DPSP-1 in 2008, and discussions that ADB held with the World Bank and the Government for \nthe preparation of a separate program completion report for the DPSP-2, and the DPSP-3 in 2009 (Appendix 3). \n ", "10  \npolicy  measures  have  also  supported  revisions  to  the  Tax  Law,  the  implementing  decree \nrelating to tax audit procedures, implementation decrees supporting the investment law, and the \nrollout  of  a  national  single  window  (NSW)  with  online  clearance  of  merchandise.  A  key \nachievement under the public financial management pillar has been the implementation of the \ntreasury single account (TSA) to improve cash management of public finances. The DPL/DPSP \nprogram has helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across the budget \ncycle.  The  national  budget  is  now  compatible  with  the  international  standard  government \nfinance statistics (GFS) classification. Fiscal reporting is more comprehensive and timely, and \nelements of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) have been introduced, though not \nfully operational in the budget system. Initial steps to address civil service reform have been \nlaunched under the DPL/DPSP series. As an initial measure, the DPL/DPSP supported the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive reform of the structure and remuneration framework for high-\nranking state officials. A task force was set up to examine the entire compensation package with \nthe goal of creating a more transparent, systematic, and coherent framework for pay and \nallowances based on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay grading. Building on this, MOF \nhas developed a comprehensive civil service reform action plan, which is being pilot tested in \nother agencies. Important steps were also established under the DPL/DPSP series to help lay \nthe groundwork for improving poverty targeting of basis services. As the 2005 fuel price hike \nmade available more funds for social spending, the DPL/DPSP supported building capacity in \ngovernment institutions to create a more evaluative institutional framework that would improve \nthe targeting of these released funds. Lessons from targeting were incorporated into the new \ncash transfer program that accompanied the May 2008 fuel price increase. The DPSP/DPL has \nalso supported critical actions to improve the quality of public service delivery in education and \ncommunity-based development. \nD.  Lessons \n25.  Donor  coordination.  The  DPL/DPSP  facility  provided  a  useful  platform  for  donor \ncoordination  of  policies  and  programs.  The  Government  welcomed  the  development  of  a \nconsistent approach to critical reform issues among key donors. Sharing of technical advisory \nsupport, information, and data that had implications for cooperation in other operational areas \ntook place among donors (notably in programs to support infrastructure development, where \nADB took the lead role). \n \n26.  Coordination within Government. The negotiations to develop the DPL/DPSP and the \nneed  to  develop  joint  positions  on  policy  issues  necessitated  regular  and  continuous \ninteragency consultation and coordination that may have indirectly led to systemic changes in \nthe policy coordination process within key agencies of the Government. This was noted by \nstakeholders during the current review process. \n \n27.  The Role of Policy Triggers. Although these represented actions that the Government \nfully intended to undertake independently, the choice of outcomes/triggers was important in \nguiding both the direction and pace of the reform process within the Government. The inclusion \nof a trigger/outcome in the DPL/DPSP was welcomed by those pushing for particular reforms \nwithin the Government, as this would increase the political profile of the reform and this could \nhelp ensure the maintenance of the momentum needed to achieve the reform. At the same \ntime, the process of identifying triggers was sometimes used by reformers to unrealistically \noverpromise to push through as much of the reforms as possible without regard to meeting the \ndeadline of the prior actions.  \n ", " 11\n28.  The Importance of Continuity in the Reform Process, Building on Earlier Changes. \nSome  reforms\u2014such  as  the  TSA\u2014led  to  solid  progress  on  a  reform  objective,  and  the \nDPL/DPSP played a clear role in their achievement. These reforms are also more sustainable, \nas the reforms progressed and were deepened, and the parties involved remained engaged in \nthe reform process. \n \n29.  The Design and Specification of Specific Triggers. The wording of each policy action \nrequired under the program was developed on the basis of mutual trust and understanding \nbetween the Government and the three development partners, with a clear understanding of the \ndirection  of  reforms,  without  excessive  specificity  that  would  create  political  difficulties  or \ncompromise the flexibility of the Government in overcoming obstacles to reform. This was \nespecially important in areas where the executing agency (MOF) or the agencies working most \nclosely  with  it  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA)  and  Bappenas  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency) had no direct control over implementation of a particular reform, \nas other agencies or Parliament were involved. \n \n30.  Strengthening Change Management Capacity in the Government and Identifying \nKey Change Management Points. The success of the DPL/DPSP programs has hinged on the \nproactive  role  taken  by  key  counterparts  willing  to  take  up  difficult  change  management \nfunctions. This has involved a strong communications strategy with all concerned stakeholders, \nmaking  assessments  of  potential  gains  and  losses  to  key  stakeholders,  having  realistic \nassessments of the time frames required to implement specific actions, and identifying potential \nrisks and obstacles as well as remedial and palliative actions. It was widely recognized that \nsupporting the agencies leading the reform process (through advisory services or technical \nsupport) would yield disproportionately large benefits in terms of the facilitation of future reforms \nand the formulation and design of the Government\u2019s forward-looking reform agenda. DPL/DPSP \nreforms have tended to be most successful in areas where they were complemented by a \nstrong TA program. \n ", "12  \nFigure 1: Support for the Government\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan \nStrategic Framework: Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM)\nOutcomes:  \n(i)  Revive economic growth to achieve 7% average annual real GDP growth by 2009.  \n(ii)  Halve poverty from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009. \n(iii)  Reduce unemployment by 2009 from the current levels above 10%. \n(iv)  Promote good governance through combating corruption. \n(v)  Ensure peace, safety, security, justice, and democracy for all Indonesians. \nDPL Series (Coordinated by  Close seamless  Sector Programs under the New \nthe World Bank)  coordination  CSP (Coordinated by ADB) \n  moving from   \n(cid:190)  High-level macroeconomic  macro- (cid:190)  Deeper sector-specific \nand cross-sector reforms  economic to  implementation support for policy, \n(cid:190)  Small number of strategic  sector reforms,  institutional, regulatory reforms  \ntriggers per core policy  reinforced by  (cid:190)  Each program designed as a \narea  cofinancing  cluster, with subprograms \n(cid:190) Annualprogramlending where possible  sequencedover18\u201324months\nCore Policy Area 1:  Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program Cluster\nMacroeconomic Stability and  \u2022  Comprehensive sector and cross-sector reforms as \nCreditworthiness  outlined in the Program Cluster over 2005\u20132010 \n  \u2022  Establishment of Project Development Facility \n\u2022  Monitoring progress  \u2022  Supporting infrastructure project transactions \n \nCapital Market Development Program Cluster\n\u2022  Enhanced information disclosure and improved price \ndiscovery \nCore Policy Area 2: Improving \n\u2022  Deeper and more liquid financial markets \nInvestment Climate \n\u2022  Improved market surveillance and investor protection \n\u2022  Regulatory reforms \n\u2022  Improved governance and human resource capacity in \n\u2022  Tax and customs reforms \nmarket institutions\n\u2022  Strengthening financial \nsector and SME access to \nfinance  Local Government Finance and Governance Reform \nProgram Cluster and the State Audit Reform Program \n\u2022  Ex ante planning and budget reforms through Program \nCore Policy Area 3: Improving \nCluster \nPublic Financial Management \n\u2022  Streamlining fiscal decentralization \n\u2022  Strengthening budgeting, \n\u2022  Local government level civil service reforms \ncontrols, and transparency, \n\u2022  Improving public financial management (ex ante aspects \nand procurement \nthrough Program Cluster and internal control and audits \n\u2022   Civil Service Reform \nthrough State Audit Reform Program) \nCore Policy Area 4: Improved \nDelivery of Public Services  Poverty Reduction and MDG Acceleration Program Cluster\n\u2022  Pro-poor targeting of public  \u2022  Improving delivery of health, education, and other \nprograms  community services in MDG-deficit areas, in a \n\u2022  Strengthening public service  programmatic manner \ndelivery and community  \u2022  Enhancing accountability for service delivery at local \ndriven development  government and institutional levels, reinforced by well-\ndefined standards that are based on clear costing  \n\u2022  Facilitating transition toward greater performance-\norientation \nRPJM = Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah (medium-term development plan); DPL = development policy \nloan; CSP = country strategy and program; MDG = Millennium Development Goal.  \nSource: ADB. \n ", " 13\n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The impact of the DPSP-4 will be in the form of higher economic growth that is sustained \nover the medium term and accompanied by lower levels of unemployment and poverty. Its main \noutcome is improved overall economic management anchored on good governance through \n(i) an improved investment climate, (ii) improved public financial management, and (iii) improved \ndelivery of public services. \n \n32.  The design and monitoring framework for the DPSP-4 is in Appendix 1. The letter of \ndevelopment policy for DPSP-4 is in Appendix 4, and the policy matrix is in Appendix 5. \nAppendix 6 presents the development partners coordination matrix, outlining support from ADB \nand other development partners in areas related to the DPSP series, while Appendix 9 presents \nthe summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n33.  The DPSP-4 is in substantive terms a continuation of DPSPs 1\u20133, the programmatic \nseries  of  annual  single-tranche  operations  from  2005  to  2007.7 The  proposed  Program \ncontinues the policy dialogue on, and support to, Indonesia\u2019s reform program in the three core \nareas  that  were  the  focus  of  the  DPSP-3:  (i)  the  investment  climate,  (ii)  public  financial \nmanagement  and  governance,  and  (iii)  improved  delivery  of  public  services  to  the  poor. \nImprovements in the investment climate are critical to accelerating growth; public financial \nmanagement and civil service reforms are essential for enhancing government effectiveness in \na decentralized and democratic Indonesia. In addition, improving service delivery and poverty \nalleviation efforts is essential if Indonesia is to bring about more broad-based improvements in \nwelfare for all its population.  \n \n34.  All the triggers in these three areas were chosen as part of the dialogue with the \nGovernment during preparation of the DPSP-3, and represent a natural next step from those \nthat were achieved in that program. The policy and reform focus of these triggers have further \nevolved  and  moved  progressively  forward  to  include  improved  regulations,  increased \ntransparency, and deepened institutions prerequisites to sustain medium-term growth and social \ndevelopment. The DPSP-3 program document laid out 17 indicative triggers (prior actions) \nacross nine policy areas for the DPSP-4. Satisfactory progress has been made on all the \ntriggers, with two having exceeded requirements (Table 4).8  \n                                                 \n \n7  As originally envisaged in the Indonesia CSP, there was to be no DPSP loan in 2008, with the last loan in the \nseries (DPSP-4) programmed for 2009. However, based on a government request for ADB to participate in the \nDPL process in 2008, the proposed loan in 2009 was advanced to 2008, and a new loan for 2009 (DPSP-5) has \nbeen programmed in the Indonesia country operations business plan (ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business \nPaln (2009\u20142011): Indonesia. Manila), to coincide with the ending of the Government\u2019s medium-term development \nplan 2004\u20142009.   \n8  In keeping with the DPL modality, which has been characterized by medium-term engagement, strong country \nownership, and continuous policy dialogue with the Government, triggers are used in a more process-oriented and \nflexible sense with less of a focus on compliance with conditions. International experience with policy-based \nlending and recent literature on the subject suggests that a focus on traditional conditionality could undermine \ncountry ownership and the sustainability of the reform process (World Bank. 2005. Conditionality Revisited. \nWashington,  DC;  ADB.  2007.  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  Policy-Based  Lending:  Emerging  Practices  in \nSupporting Reforms in Developing Member Countries.

The schedule for implementing the latter has now changed, as the Government has decided first to \nundertake a detailed study on design options this year, followed by determination of the actual design of the \npolicyholder protection scheme next year.

Core Policy Area I: Improved Investment Climate \n35.  Investment growth accelerated in 2007, rising to 9.2% from just 2.5% the previous year \nand accounting for one-third of total economic growth. As a share of GDP, investment reached \n25%, a major improvement from 19% immediately after the Asian financial crisis, but still not a \nfull recovery to pre-crisis levels of nearly 30% of GDP, and considerably below the investment \nrates  of  countries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (45%)  and  Viet  Nam  (32%). \nInvestment growth continued to accelerate during the first semester of 2008, reaching 14.1%, \nand contributing 41% to GDP growth.  \n \n36.  Some of the impetus for recent strong investment trends may be coming from higher \nforeign direct investment. The Investment Board reports that realized foreign investment nearly \ndoubled from $5.9 billion in 2006 to $10.4 billion in 2007, and increased by nearly 2.5 times to \n$10.4 billion during January\u2013June 2008 (from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2007).  \n \n37.  Business  perceptions  of  the  investment  climate,  especially  those  relating  to \nimprovements in macroeconomic stability and economic policy, may explain part of the recent \n ", "16  \nrecovery of investment. The annual survey of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation of \n600 Japanese multinational companies also showed an improvement in Indonesia\u2019s global \nranking  in  2007,  following  4 straight  years  of  decline,  with  Japanese  multinationals  rating \nIndonesia as the eighth most promising country for overseas investment.  \n \n38.  Part of this improvement in perceptions may be due to the economic reform programs \nintroduced by the Government over the past 3 years (Appendix 3). Major achievements under \nthese packages include the Investment Law, 2007; the Tax Administration Law, 2007; and the \n2008  law  on  electronic  transactions  that  provides  a  legal  basis  for  e-Government.  The \ninvestment law stipulates equal treatment for foreign and domestic investors and reinforces \ninvestor protections. \n \n39.  Major reforms in tax administration and customs administration are under way, including \na  new  VAT  refund  system  that  promises  refunds  in  7 days  for  \u201cgolden\u201d  taxpayers,  within \n2 months  for  low-risk  exporters,  and  within  4  months  for  medium-risk  exporters.  Standard \noperating procedures for a complaints management system have also been issued, including a \ncode  of  ethics  for  tax  officials.  Implementation  of  a  single  window  for  export  and  import \ndocumentation was launched on a pilot basis for selected large importers in Indonesia\u2019s main \nseaport in December 2007 and is currently being expanded to additional importers and ports. \nFull  implementation  will  eventually  allow  electronic  submission  and  approval  of  a  single \ncombined  customs  form  covering  all  required  clearances,  and  a  consequent  reduction  in \nclearance times. Reforms to the procedures for establishing a limited liability company were \nissued in September 2007, reducing business start-up times from 105 days in 2007 to 76 days \nin 2008. \n \n40.  Notwithstanding these reforms, recent gains have taken place from a low base and \nbusinesses in Indonesia still face an overall poor business climate. Indonesia\u2019s investment \nclimate continues to rank poorly in international comparisons. The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business \n2009 report ranks Indonesia 129 out of 181 countries on the ease of doing business, a drop of \ntwo places since the 2008 report, and well behind its regional competitors such as Thailand \n(13),  Malaysia  (20),  PRC  (83),  and  Viet  Nam  (92).9 Other  indicators  such  as  the  World \nEconomic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index also show little improvement, with Indonesia\u2019s \nranking remaining virtually unchanged from 2007 to 2008 (54 out of 131 countries in 2008, \ncompared to 51 out of 122 countries in 2007)10. Indonesia\u2019s poor performance in these indices \nreflects the fact that other countries have been making a greater effort to improve their business \nclimate relative to Indonesia. Business in Indonesia continues to face a difficult legal and \nregulatory environment, while implementation of policies remains poor because of inefficient \ncoordination and capacity constraints in government agencies. Strict labor regulations continue \nto create a disincentive to employment expansion, while lack of access to long-term finance and \ninfrastructure weaknesses raises the cost and uncertainty of doing business. The Government \nis attempting to address this issue by forging partnerships with the private sector. To support \ngovernment efforts in this area, ADB is providing TA to strengthen institutions promoting public\u2013\nprivate partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure provision, and it is providing a loan to fund a project \ndevelopment facility that will assist in preparing PPP projects for tendering to the private sector \non  a  transparent  and  competitive  basis.11 ADB  is  also  providing  assistance  for  long-term \n                                                 \n \n9  World Bank. 2008.

Trigger 1: PEPI to coordinate the development of regulations and technical \nguidelines for effective implementation of the Investment Law by undertaking a \nreview of the negative list (Presidential Regulation No. 77/2007), and oversee the \ncompilation of a mapping of business licenses in key economic sectors with a view to \nintroducing recommendations for specific licenses to be streamlined or eliminated. \n(current status: satisfactory) \n \n41.  The national team to enhance exports and investment (PEPI) under the Coordinating \nMinistry for Economic Affairs has already undertaken a review of the investment negative list \n(Presidential Regulation No. 77/2007), incorporating inputs from the private sector. The new list \nwas issued in December 2007 and clarifies that companies existing prior to the issuance of the \nnegative  list  were  grandfathered  with  respect  to  new  restrictions.  A  few  sectors,  such  as \nbusiness and management consulting services, were also opened to greater levels of foreign \ninvestment. The development of technical guidelines for investment procedures and undertaking \na mapping of business licenses to support license simplification is behind schedule, partly \nbecause of a delay in obtaining the requisite finances for these activities. Funds have now been \nearmarked and a tender has been issued for a study of sectoral investment regulations that will \nsupport mapping of business licenses.  \n \nb.  Trigger 2: Increase the ability to monitor the investment climate by: (i) posting \npublicly, average processing time for VAT refunds; (ii) making available data on the \ntime taken to establish a company from reserving the name to issuing the \nlegalization decree; and (iii) designing a system to monitor and report on import \nclearance time from unloading to gate-out combining data from the Port Operator \nand Customs. (current status: achieved) \n \n42.  Directorate General of Taxes (DG Tax) has already published on its website the average \nprocessing time for a number of taxpayer services, including VAT refunds (broken down by \ntaxpayer risk categories: low, medium, and high). Pursuant to Director General Taxes Circular \nLetter 19/PJ/2008, this data will be updated quarterly as part of the tax office key performance \nindicators. The Ministry of Justice has made available data from its SISMINBAKUM database on \nthe time taken to establish a company from reserving the name to issuing the legalization \ndecree.  Standard  templates  for  reporting  and  publishing  summary  statistics  are  being \ndeveloped. The Customs Department has designed a new data system known as TPS Online \nthat will combine customs data with data from terminal operators, thereby allowing more careful \nmonitoring of import clearance time. TPS Online is scheduled to go live in December 2008. \n \nc.  Trigger 3: Continue to implement the national single window (NSW), including \nincreasing the number of participating agencies and companies.  Extend the original \npilot (current status: achieved) \n \n43.  Considerable progress has been made in developing the NSW. A national team to \nestablish the single window, chaired by the minister of finance and led at the working level by a \ndeputy under the coordinating minister for the economy, has been created. A pilot project was \n                                                                                                                                                          \n \nBoard of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Infrastructure Reform Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (Loan 2264-INO[SF], approved November, $26.5 million equivalent). \n ", "18  \nlaunched at Jakarta's Tanjung Priok seaport in December 2007, involving 100 priority lane \ncompanies and customs, the port authority, Ministry of Trade, the Food and Drug Agency, and \nquarantine. In August 2008, this was expanded to an additional 10 government agencies, and \nas of early September 2008, 143 companies were reported to be using the NSW. The pilot has \nbeen  extended  to  the  three  additional  seaports  as  well  as  the  Jakarta  airport.    The \nGovernment\u2019s 2008 Economic Policy Package (Presidential Instruction No. 5/2008) targets a \ndecision to be made on the operational model for the NSW by December 2008, which will be \ncritical for the next stage of implementation. \n \n44.  The NSW for imports and exports is the most important trade facilitation initiative under \nway in Indonesia. Under a single window, traders (importers and exporters) will no longer be \nrequired to apply individually to multiple government agencies\u2014such as customs, the port \nauthority, Ministry of Trade, the Food and Drug Agency, and quarantine\u2014to clear cargoes. A \nsingle  application  is  instead  submitted  using  a  single  administrative  document  and  this \napplication  is  transmitted  to  each  relevant  agency  by  the  operator  of  the  single  window. \nApproval is transmitted back to the operator so that the trader communicates directly with one \nauthority rather than multiple authorities. The Indonesian NSW is being established in the \nframework of several ASEAN agreements as an initial step toward an eventual ASEAN single \nwindow for international trade. \n \nd.  Trigger 4: Issue implementing regulations for the Tax Administration Law and \nmonitoring instructions to tax offices.  Establish a system to monitor and report on \nresponse time for tax audit objections and appeals. (current status: exceeded) \n \n45.  As of September 2008, all implementation regulations for the tax administration law have \nbeen issued and posted on the DG Tax website, and socialized to tax offices across the \ncountry.  The Tax Administration Law, 2007, strikes a better balance between the rights and \nobligations of taxpayers and the powers of tax officials\u2014an issue of longstanding concern to the \nbusiness  community.  To  take  effect,  the  law  needed  to  be  supported  by  implementing \nregulations issued by DG Tax and socialized to tax offices across the country. These new \nregulations clarify and provide certainty in the administrative procedures for taxpayers to comply \nwith the law, as well as for the tax officials to provide services to taxpayers. \n \n46.  In August 2008, DG Tax published on its website the average processing time for each \nof  the  eight  major  taxpayer  services,  including  tax  objections,  taxpayer  registration,  VAT \nrefunds, exemption of withholding tax on imports, and property relief tax. This data on the \naverage response times of these major taxpayer services will be updated and monitored by \nDG Tax every quarter. This follows the issuance of Director General of Taxes Circular Letter \n19/PJ/2008 requiring all tax offices to report on a quarterly basis the average time to process \nthese taxpayer services as part of its effort to improve taxpayer services and monitor the \nperformance of tax offices.  \n \ne.  Trigger 5: Continue the tariff harmonization program and implement effective and \ntransparent operating procedures, including public disclosure (current status: \nachieved) \n \n47.  Indonesia has been implementing a major tariff harmonization program since 2005 to \nsimplify the structure of import tariffs and reduce the number of tariff brackets. The program is \nscheduled to end in 2010. Tim Tarif, the agency reviewing proposals for tariff change, is on \ntrack  for  its  tariff  harmonization  target  for  2008  as  shown  by  the  MOF  Regulation  (PMK) \nNo. 70/PMK.011/2008. As a result of the latest tariff harmonization, in 2008 around 86% of ", " 19\napplied tariff lines will be 0%\u201310% with only 2% of tariffs higher than 35%. In 2008, the simple \naverage tariff will be down to 7.7%, compared to 9.9% in 2004. \n \n48.  The Government is showing commitment to improving procedures and transparency in \nreviewing tariff proposals by Tim Tarif by introducing a ministerial decree that dictates the \nmaximum time allowed for reviewing tariff proposals, and governs general rules for plenary \nmeetings in Tim Tarif (appendix in MOF decree to renew the mandate for Tim Tarif, KMK \nNo. 285/KMK.011/2007).  With  respect  to  disclosure,  Tim  Tarif  has  been  disclosing  MOF \ndecrees on tariff policies on its website.12 \n \nf.  Trigger 6: Issue a government decree specifying a higher capital requirement for \ninsurance companies (current status: achieved) \n \n49. Peraturan  Pemerintah  (PP)  or  government  regulation  No.  39/2008  specifying  a  higher \ncapital requirement for insurance companies was issued on 19 May 2008. The decree is part of \nthe  broader  effort  to  reduce  financial  sector  vulnerabilities  and  improve  the  stability  and \noperations of insurance markets, a key nonbank market needed to spread risk and increase the \navailability of longer-term finance. An earlier regulation in 1999 (PP No. 73/99) had raised the \nminimum  paid-up  capital  to  Rp100  billion  for  insurance  companies  and  Rp200  billion  for \nreinsurance companies (from Rp2 billion for life insurance companies, Rp3 billion for nonlife \ninsurance companies, and Rp10 billion for reinsurance companies). However, this regulation \nwas only applicable to new companies, which meant that companies that existed before the \neffective  date  of  PP  No.  73/99  were  not  subjected  to  this  regulation.  This  created  unfair \ntreatment among companies and unfavorable conditions for industry development. The new \nregulation stipulates that the minimum paid-up capital of Rp100 billion for insurance companies \nand Rp200 billion for reinsurance companies should be applicable to all such companies and \nsets a date of 31 December 2010 for full compliance with this requirement. \n \ng.  Trigger 7: Rationalize SME financing/microfinance schemes across line ministries \nand state-owned enterprises (SOE), including issuing a presidential decree on the \nlegal establishment of provincial credit guarantee and re-guarantee institutions \n(current status: achieved) \n \n50.  Access to credit has long been a major constraint to the growth of micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia. Numerous line ministries and SOEs have \ntried to run several schemes to finance micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises with limited \nsuccess. On the other hand, the ability of PT Askrindo and Perum Jamkrindo, the two credit \nguarantee institutions set up by the Government to reduce risks to banks, to underwrite new \nbusiness had been severely constrained by the limited availability of capital. The Government \nresolved this issue by injecting capital of Rp1.4 trillion to these companies in late 2007. In \nOctober 2007, the Government also moved towards rationalizing all SME financing programs of \nline ministries into a unified guarantee scheme by initiating the signing of a memorandum of \nunderstanding with six banks, five line ministries and the two credit guarantee companies to \nlaunch the People\u2019s Entrepreneurship Credit Program (KUR) to facilitate partially guarantee \ncredits to MSMEs. Under the KUR scheme, the banks will take up 30% of the credit risk and the \ncredit guarantee institutions will take the remainder. As of July 2008, disbursements under the \nKUR had reached around Rp9 trillion. In addition, the Government also issued Presidential \n                                                 \n \n12 Tim Tarif. www.tarif.depkeu.go.id \n ", "20  \nRegulation No. 2/2008 in January 2008 that allowed for the establishment of provincial credit \nguarantee companies and the development of re-guarantee companies. \n2.  Core Policy Area II: Improved Public Financial Management and \nGovernance \n51.  After the adoption of a new regulatory framework of 2003-2004, the Government is \nimplementing public financial management reforms as legislated. These efforts are part of a \nbroader agenda to improve governance and enhance service delivery, with the ultimate goal of \nsustained economic growth and poverty alleviation. Progress has been achieved in the way \npublic finances are managed and in increasing transparency and independent oversight. In \nparticular,  progress  has  been  made  in  streamlining  the  budget  formulation  process  and \ndocumentation as articulated in new public financial management (PFM) laws. The Government \nis also beginning to address civil service reforms with a view to providing an enabling framework \nfor more effective public institutions. These achievements provide a firm foundation for further \nprogress,  but  significant  challenges  remain  across  the  public  financial  management  cycle \nincluding budget formulation, execution, and reporting and auditing. \n \n52.  Although the budget preparation process is not yet compatible with a medium-term fiscal \nperspective, progress is being made on this front. There has been some progress in recent \nyears in terms of aligning policy priorities to allocations in the budget. The DPL-4/DPSP-3 also \nsupported the introduction of a medium-term macro fiscal framework in the 2008 budget, with a \nsystem of forward estimates for two out-years. However, budget submissions continue to be \nannual and there is no framework to establish credible forward estimates that are reconciled \nwith the projected resource envelope and other projections. To address this issue, the current \nprogram supports reforms to the budget preparation process by revising budget templates to \ngive them a greater results orientation. Despite these efforts, the full development of a medium-\nterm expenditure framework (MTEF) can realistically only be achieved in the medium to long \nterm.  \n \n53.  With regard to the budget execution process, a number of challenges remain pertaining \nto cash management, processing, accounting and reporting of both revenue and expenditure \ntransactions,  and  the  execution  of  capital  expenditures.  Progress  has  been  made  in  the \ndevelopment of a treasury single account (TSA) to strengthen cash management, but a number \nof accounts (e.g., salary accounts, revenue accounts) continue to hold idle cash balances and \noperational cash planning is at a very early stage of development. A chart of accounts broadly \nconsistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001 was introduced in \n2005,  enabling  codification  of  expenditures  across  multiple  dimensions  and  stages  of  the \nexpenditure management cycle, but some segments such as the activity and program codes \nneed improvement. The Government also promulgated Government Accounting Standards in \n2005 that are being adhered to, and has made good progress in ensuring timely availability of \nannual financial statements to Parliament and to the public. Additional MOF regulations have \nput emphasis on ministers being responsible to record the budget allotment in their ministries; \nintroduced new accounting subsystems at the treasury accounting system; and placed more \nemphasis on receivables, payables, and investment recording at the line ministries. However, \nthere are problems in the application of the standards in the line ministries, and the systems and \ndata environment for processing and recording of transactions is fragmented and not yet fully \nautomated\u2014undermining and the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. This has led the \nexternal audit over the past years to issue a disclaimer audit opinion on the annual financial \nstatements because of reliability and other issues. There are also problems in the execution of \nthe capital budget, and procedural bottlenecks have caused expenditure patterns to remain ", " 21\nskewed toward the second half of the fiscal year. This has raised issues of quality of spending \nand project preparation and implementation. If not addressed expeditiously, these weaknesses \nin budget execution could potentially threaten the Government\u2019s ability to maintain good fiscal \ndiscipline and expenditure management. \n \n54.  In  addition,  government-wide  civil  service  regulations  give  limited  flexibility  to  line \nagencies to attract, recruit, deploy, and retain staff with professional skills that match their \nincreasingly  complex  operational  needs.  Centralized  controls  and  strict  guidelines  for \norganizational design applied government-wide create a rigid system that make adjustments of \norganizational  structures  difficult.  Taken  together,  these  regulations  impede  performance \nmanagement and professionalism in public institutions. \n \n55.  The  DPL-5/DPSP-4  is  bolstering  critical  reform  measures  aimed  at  addressing  the \nchallenges  identified.  Strategically  chosen,  the  DPSP-4/DPL-5  actions  support  the  broader \ngovernance agenda in Indonesia with actions focused on key aspects in budget preparation, \nexecution, and civil service reforms. Specifically, the DPL-5 supports reforms to the budget \npreparation  process  with  a  view  to  instituting  more  results-oriented  budget  documents. \nCommensurate  with  the  significant  challenges  in  the  budget  execution  area,  the  program \nincludes four reform actions to enhance budget execution, including further implementation of \nthe TSA and automation of treasury operations, actions aimed at smoothing disbursement of \ncapital  expenditures,  the  strengthening  of  accounting  capabilities  in  line  ministries,  and \nimproving the institutional framework for procurement reforms. In addition, through the focus on \ncivil  service  reforms,  the  DPL/DPSP  seeks  to  expand  this  reform  area  beyond  the  pilot \nspearheaded by MOF.  \n \na.  Trigger 8: Make further progress toward the establishment of a comprehensive TSA \nregime, including revenue accounts. Establish a counterpart team to implement the \nnew automated treasury system, and begin mapping and reviewing of business \nprocesses to increase readiness for system rollout in 2009. Modernize 30 provincial \ntreasury offices (KPPNs) (status: achieved) \n \n56.  Considerable progress has been made in implementing a TSA, as foreseen by the State \nTreasury Law, 2004. The rollout to the revenue accounts has commenced on a pilot basis after \nlong delays brought on by protracted negotiations with Bank Indonesia and commercial banks \non interest payment for government balances held at Bank Indonesia and remuneration of \nbanking  services  by  the  Government.  The  Treasury  is  pilot  testing  the  daily  sweep  of \ngovernment revenue deposits from collecting branches of the five largest commercial banks and \npost offices into the TSA with Bank Indonesia. The daily sweep is expected to be extended to all \ncommercial bank branches starting January 2009. The daily sweep will be with respect to \ndeposits made the previous day and not on the same day. This is because the commercial \nbanks have agreed not to charge for this service provided the sweep is done the following day. \nThis is a significant improvement over the current practice, established since 1989, of sweeping \nthe revenue accounts twice a week. Concerning cash concentration of accounts held by line \nministries, MOF has completed a census of all government accounts pursuant to the regulation \non management of government bank accounts issued in 2007. This census identified 32,570 \nsuch accounts. At the end of December 2007, 2,086 of these accounts were closed. Efforts are \nongoing to determine further banks accounts of the remaining 30,484, which can be included in \nthe TSA regime either directly or through a mechanism of daily sweeps into the TSA. \n \n57.  MOF is preparing for the implementation of an integrated financial management system \nto replace the multitude of financial data processing applications currently used by government \n ", "22  \ninstitutions. The system, known by the acronym SPAN, will integrate and replace the multiple \nsoftware applications within the treasury as well as those being implemented in the DG Budget \nto support the budget formulation process. Following a detailed internal review of the system, a \nnew management and implementation structure for the automated treasury system was agreed \nupon, and a counterpart team for implementing the system has been established. The mapping \nand review of business processes has commenced.  The modernization of treasury offices has \nbeen completed in 33 out of 176 KPPNs, exceeding the trigger requirement. \n \nb.  Trigger 9: Enhance performance-based budgeting by initiating a review and revision \nof the existing program structure to increase accountability, revise the budget \nsubmission templates (for RKA-KL), draft accompanying budget preparation \nmanuals, and draft key performance indicators for the Ministry of Finance (current \nstatus: achieved) \n \n58.  As part of the move toward program and performance-based budgeting, DG Budget in \nMOF has started to review and refine the Ministry/Institutional Budget and work plans (RKA-KL) \nand accompanying budget preparation manuals for six pilot ministries. This is with a view to \nsimplifying the budget submission and to link it more closely to programs. Beside performance \nindicators, the templates also add narrative information on program strategies and objectives in \norder to provide a clearer link between program objectives and funding levels. The templates \nalso contain columns for forward estimates of expenditures. The draft MTEF-performance-\nbased budgeting (PBB) budget preparation manuals are being finalized by DG Budget and \nBappenas. The intention is to use the MTEF-PBB manual to guide ministries in their budget \nsubmissions pertaining to FY2010.13 \n \n59.  In parallel, Bappenas, in coordination with MOF, is reviewing and revising the existing \nprogram structure. The new program structure will be embedded in the next 5-year plan, which \nwill cover 2010\u20132014. The intention is to align programs to organizational structures to create \nan accountability framework. Key performance indicators for the Ministry of Finance have been \ndrafted and are under review. \n \nc.  Trigger 10: All DIPAs are issued and teams assigned at the beginning of the \nfiscal year, by eliminating the annual surat keputusans requirement (for project \nmanagers) for multi-year projects and allowing for parallel processing of \nprocurement. (current status: achieved) \n \n60.  DIPAs (spending warrants) for the 2008 budget were issued on 2 January 2008 and \nother actions to smoothen disbursement patterns are ongoing. DG Treasury is preparing a new \nregulation for accepting the names of key officials of satkers (project management units) listed \nin the DIPA as the legally authorized budget users of the satkers. This will obviate the need for \nissuing annual surat keputusans (decree letters) reappointing key satker officials. However, \nsurat keputusans will be issued whenever there is a change in the incumbents. It is expected \nthat the new regulation will become effective from FY2009. \n \n61.  The parallel initiation of procurement has been implemented in some line ministries, \nincluding the Ministry of Public Works.  While procurements can legally be initiated after the \nadoption of the state budget in October of the preceding fiscal year, this practice is not widely \n                                                 \n \n13 The 2010 budget will be the first in the next 5-year planning period, which will outline the policy priorities of the \nincoming government after the general elections in 2009. ", " 23\nadopted because of a number of reasons. These include a lack of knowledge of this fact as well \nas  a  lack  of  operating  expenses  to  cover  procurement-related  costs,  including  posting  of \nadvertisements and meetings of procurement committees. The main issue here appears to be \nanticipation of budget needs for starting the procurement process in the previous fiscal year by \nincluding a line item in the DIPA identifying pre-financing needs for the following year\u2019s budget. \nThe National Public Procurement Office (LKPP) has issued a circular to publicize this to line \nministries, with guidance on how to initiate procurement steps prior to the start of the fiscal year. \n \n62.  The  detrimental  impact  of  slow  and  skewed  disbursements  of  capital  and  material \nexpenditures has been widely recognized by policymakers and budget stakeholders at various \nlevels.  The  Treasury  has  conducted  a  survey  of  the  impediments  to  the  disbursement  of \nbudgetary funds through questionnaires. The results of the survey have been reviewed, and \nhave formed the basis of an action plan, which has been drafted, to smooth out disbursements \nduring the year.  \n \nd.  Trigger 11: Complete a midterm review to assess the application of accounting \nstandards and accounting procedure manuals by line ministries (current status: \nexceeded) \n \n63.  A midterm review was undertaken and revised accounting procedures for line ministries \nhave been issued. MOF Regulation No. 171/PMK.05/2007 on Accounting System for Line \nMinistries was issued on 27 December 2007, replacing PMK 59/PMK.05/2005 on the Central \nGovernment Accounting System.  \n \n64.  The revision was necessitated by significant problems in the application of the 2005 \nstandards in the line ministries. The annual financial statements of a number of line ministries \nreceive a disclaimer audit opinion from the external auditor because of issues on completeness \nand reliability. The changes brought about by the new regulation include (i) an emphasis on line \nministries being responsible for recording the budget allotment for their ministries; and (ii) an \nemphasis on recording receivables, payables, and investments by the line ministries with a \nrequirement  that  these  should  be  recorded  and  reported  in  the  line  ministries\u2019  financial \nstatements.  These changes also represent an important step in moving towards full accrual \naccounting.  The changes should be reflected in the line ministries\u2019 financial statements for \n2008, which should be issued in March 2009 \n \n65.  The capacity constraints in the line ministries are being addressed through training of \nstaff  on  these  changes,  and  accounting  issues  generally,  through  an  ambitious  training \nprogram.  The  target  is  to  train  over  7,000  accounting  staff  in  line  ministries.  So  far, \n3,185 persons have been trained. The goal is to train at least one staff in a satker by the end of \nFY2009. \n \ne.  Trigger 12: Make newly established LKPP operational by recruiting staff and \nallocating budget to cover operational costs and revise Presidential Decree No. \n80/2003 to, among others, accommodate a new set of standard bidding documents \n(current status: satisfactory) \n \n66.  The  last  year  has  seen  the  enactment  of  the  legal  framework  establishing  an \nindependent Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah (LKPP) or the national \npublic  procurement  office  reporting  directly  to  the  President.  The  development  of  the \norganization structure and staffing for the new LKPP is progressing well. In addition to the \nchairperson and an executive secretary, there will be four departments, each headed by an \n ", "24  \nechelon  I  deputy  with  respective  responsibility  for  (i) strategy  and  policy  development, \n(ii) monitoring  evaluation  and  information  systems,  (iii) human  resources  development,  and \n(iv) legal affairs and settlement of objections. These six major positions have been filled, and the \njob descriptions for echelon II and III staff have been finalized and recruitment is ongoing. The \nnecessary budget allocation for operational costs has been provided to LKPP. \n \n67.  Progress on streamlining the regulatory framework for public procurement is under way \nthough perhaps not at the pace anticipated. Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 promotes the \nbasic  principles  of  procurement:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and \nefficiency. It covers all areas of procurement that use public funds and contracting entities at all \nlevels of government. However, the pace of Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms has had an \nimpact  on  public  sector  procurement  as  different  levels  of  government\u2014from  ministers, \ngovernors, and even mayors\u2014are able to issue their own decrees, regulations, and instructions. \nThe plethora of regulations is often inconsistent with one another and many do not meet \naccepted international practice. Work on drafting a procurement law is in progress but finalizing \nthe law and enacting it may require another 2\u20133 years as it has to go through Parliament plus \nthe possible resistance by special interest groups. Meanwhile, LKPP is revising Presidential \nDecree 80/2003 to make it more user-friendly and update clauses where necessary. The first \nstep  is  to  compile  and  consolidate  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  and  all  subsequent \namendments into one document. This has been substantially achieved. The next step is to \nprepare  an  operational  manual  that  will  be  complemented  by  the  set  of  standard  bidding \ndocuments, which have been drafted with the help of ADB TA.14 Harmonizing Presidential \nDecree 80/2003 and the standard bidding documents with international good practice would \nimprove procurement in Indonesia and could potentially increase the use of country systems in \nprocurement under government projects financed by donors. \n \nf.  Trigger 13: Expand civil service reform pilot to five additional agencies in 2008. \nUpdate MOF organizational road map and implement next phase of the Ministry\u2019s \nhuman resource management strategy (current status: satisfactory) \n \n68.  MOF is continuing to implement its human resource management strategy. New job \ndescriptions  and  a  grading  system  were  introduced,  and  the  allocation  of  all  positions  to \n27 grades was finalized by the end of 2007. In conjunction, an extra allowance was introduced, \ndetermined by the new grading system. This represents the first step in an effort to improve \nperformance, measure performance, and reduce corruption. Echelon I officials in MOF are now \nexpected to resign from commissioner assignments in SOEs within their field of authority to \nreduce the potential for conflicts of interest. However, the other parts of this reform step have \nnot yet been completed, and Key performance indicators have not yet been introduced, delaying \nperformance-based  management.  Currently,  the  selection  process  for  recruitment  and \npromotion  is  being  transformed  into  a  process  based  on  announced  vacancies,  voluntary \napplications, and competitive selection based on merit; and an assessment center is being \nestablished to support the new policy. Simultaneously, the rotation policy (i.e., the policy under \nwhich civil servants in echelons II\u2013IV are moved between offices, functions, and locations on \naverage  once  every  third  year)  is  being  reviewed  to  support  career  development  and \nsustainability better. Development of a new intranet-based human resource information system \nhas recently been initiated.

The five agencies involved in the civil service pilot are the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK), \nKPK, Ministry of State Apparatus Reform (MenPAN), MOF, and the Supreme Court. The rollout \nof civil service reform to agencies other than MOF is now done under the aegis of the National \nCommittee for Bureaucracy Reform, by MenPAN. Three of the approved pilot agencies (MOF, \nBPK,  and  the  Supreme  Court)  have  all  received  extra  budget  allocation  to  cover  new \nallowances.  By  the  end  of  this  year,  BPK  and  the  Supreme  Court  should  have  made \nconsiderable progress in initiating reform.  KPK\u2019s role is to monitor reform progress in the other \ninstitutions, as KPK is exempt from the civil service scheme and not in need of similar reforms. \nHowever, MenPAN has yet to implement similar reforms in addition to its activities to expand \nreforms to other institutions and/or regional governments. \n3.  Core Policy Area III: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n70.  Improving delivery of public services continues to be critical for Indonesia. Lagging \nhuman development indicators\u2014such as the high maternal mortality rate, malnutrition rate, and \nlow transition from primary school to secondary school\u2014must be tackled by improving the \nquality of services. This goes beyond levels of public spending. It is about knowing what works \nand what does not. It is about institutionalizing program assessment and linking the findings with \nplanning and budget allocations. It is about having a good system to target the marginalized \ngroups. It is also about empowering local government, community, and service providers to \ndeliver quality services. \n \n71.  Indonesia has recognized the importance of institutionalizing evaluation and assessment \nin the policy formulation and budgetary allocation processes. The intent is to promote a more \nadequate generation and systematic use of public performance information in decision making \nwhile  strengthening  effective  accountability,  within  the  Government,  service  providers,  and \ncitizens. This is a complex and long-term objective, and can only happen by strengthening \ncapacities to produce reliable and timely performance information, and through the introduction \nof  sound  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure  that  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  properly \nintegrated into the management cycle. \n \n72.  Over the past few years, the Government has launched several large-scale programs to \nimprove the access of marginalized groups to basic services. Improving targeting in these \nprograms remains an ongoing challenge. Historically, household targeting systems in Indonesia \nhave not been particularly strong. Not only do all programs have sizeable under-coverage and \nleakage errors, programs also tend to have different targeting systems. \n \n73.  After  decentralization,  about  one-third  of  total  public  expenditures  is  allocated  and \nimplemented at the district level. Yet local governments have weak capacity to plan, budget, \nand execute spending of these funds, particularly in improving the delivery of public services. In \nrecent years, this has been reflected in increased surpluses run by local governments. For more \neffective spending to take place, there needs to be a substantial improvement in the capacity of \nthe local government and local service provider to plan, budget, and implement programs for \nbetter service delivery. \n \n74.  Indonesia has also had a long history of using communities to provide basic services to \npoor people through community-driven development projects. These have demonstrated that \ncommunities are well equipped to build and maintain village infrastructure, most often roads, \n ", "26  \nbridges, water supply, irrigation systems, and markets. Community-based development also \naddresses in an integrated fashion the binding constraints to poverty reduction at the village \nlevel\u2014whether these are village roads, water and sanitation systems, or other constraints to \npoverty  and  well-being.  With  the  launch  in  August  2006  of  the  National  Community \nEmpowerment  Program  (PNPM),  the  various  community-driven  development  programs  are \nbeing consolidated and will be scaled up nationwide by the end of 2009. \n \n75.  Indonesia has identified education as one of the critical sectors with regard to improving \nthe quality of life of its citizens and the attainment of its MDGs. In December 2005, with the \npassage of the Teacher Law, the Government launched a highly ambitious effort to upgrade the \nquality of its teachers. Under the new law, minimum service standards for education have been \nestablished with the help of ADB, and all teachers will have their basic salary doubled upon \nbeing certified as meeting the competency standards mandated by the law. Those in remote \nareas will be provided additional incentives, which will almost triple their basic salaries.  \n \na.  Trigger 14: Institutionalize a government system for program evaluation by \nappointing a Deputy for Performance Evaluation within Bappenas, with three \ndirectors responsible, respectively, for sectoral evaluation, regional evaluation, and \nsystems and reporting of development performance (current status: achieved) \n \n76.  The Government has institutionalized systems for program evaluation by appointing a \nDeputy for Performance Evaluation (DPE) within Bappenas, with three directors focusing on \nsectoral  evaluation,  regional  evaluation,  and  on  systems  and  reporting  of  development \nperformance. The DPE is currently developing a work plan and has been assisted in this task by \na number of donors. A high priority is working together with MOF and other departments in \nBappenas to prepare a new program structure more conducive to performance-based budgeting \nunder the new medium-term development plan (2010\u20132015).  \n \nb.  Trigger 15: Improve effectiveness in subnational spending by issuing guidelines for \npro-poor budgeting and planning for local governments. (current status: achieved) \n \n77.  The Government has committed to making public expenditures more pro-poor. With the \nrole of local governments in poverty reduction, economic development, and service delivery \nrising sharply in the years since the 2001 decentralization, public expenditures by subnational \ngovernments need to be made more pro-poor. To increase awareness of this need and build \ncapacity at the local level, the Government with the assistance of ADB has issued guidelines for \npro-poor budgeting and planning for local governments by producing a pro-poor planning and \nbudgeting handbook.15 Bappenas launched the handbook in July 2008 and has disseminated it \nto 400 local governments, and uploaded it on its website. The plan is to follow up in 2009 with \nan extensive training program. \n \nc.  Trigger 16: Increase community block grant of PNPM to maximize employment and \npoverty impacts. (current status: achieved) \n \n78.  The block grant amount has been adjusted from about Rp1.5 billion on average in 2007 \nto Rp1.8 billion in 2008. The Government is now planning for what increases will take place for \n2009. Studies have shown that the program is less effective in richer kecamatans (sub-districts), \n                                                 \n \n15 ADB. 2006.

Trigger 17: Require teachers (other than head teachers) to be assigned a minimum \nof 24 teaching hours per week in order to receive either the professional allowance \n(for certified teachers) or the special area allowance (for teachers working in \nhardship areas), or a combination of both (current status: achieved) \n \n79.  The Ministry of National Education has issued a ministerial decree requiring all teachers \nto deliver 24 teaching hours per week in order to receive the professional allowance for certified \nteachers. In addition, teachers receiving the special area allowance are required to fulfill the 24 \nteaching-hour requirement. Initial anecdotal evidence indicates that the policy is having its \nintended  effect  where  teachers  in  overstaffed  schools  are  requesting  to  be  moved  to \nunderstaffed schools. \nC.  Monitoring the Impact of DPSP-4 \n80.  As part of the policy matrix for the DPL-1 (prior to ADB\u2019s direct cofinancing involvement), \noutcome indicators and targets were introduced to highlight the expected key results of the \nsupport. These indicators were taken mainly from government planning documents. These \nindicators and targets have been adjusted as the program has evolved. They will form the basis \nfor  evaluating  the  program,  and  will  be  complemented  by  other  indicators  such  as  the \nstandardized public expenditure and financial accountability framework used to assess PFM. \nSuch an evaluation was undertaken jointly by the Government, ADB, and the World Bank earlier \nthis year for DPLs 1\u20134 and DPSP-1.16  \nD.  Triggers for Future DPLs/DPSPs \n81.  The current DPL program is the fifth such operation in Indonesia, but is the first of a new \nthree DPL series as proposed under the World Bank\u2019s country partnership strategy for FY2009\u2013\nFY2012.  Indicative  triggers  for  the  remaining  two  DPL  series  have  been  developed  after \ndetailed discussions between government counterparts and the three donors involved in the \nDPL/DPSP process, (Table 5). While triggers for DPL-6/DPSP-5 are fairly well defined, those for \nDPL-7/DPSP-6, which would be negotiated with the government that is in power following \nelections in 2009 are, of necessity, more tentative. The new program represents, in most \nrespects, a continuation of the previous program in that it is structured around many of the same \nreform aims. Among the policy actions proposed are ones that are intended to further reduce \nuncertainty for investors, continue with the implementation of the NSW, further improve the \nresults orientation of the budget process, further reduce tax compliance costs and enhance tax \npayer  services,  continue  to  improve  budget  and  cash  management  within  the  central \ngovernment, continue the efforts to improve public procurement, and enhance the pro-poor \nimpact of public service delivery.  At the request of the Government, facilitating trade integration \nand promoting export competitiveness, and strengthening management of state assets have \nbeen added as new reform aims of the program. \n \n                                                 \n \n16 Based on the joint evaluation, a project completion report (PCR) for the DPSP-1 has been completed. The PCR for \nthe DPSP 2\u20133 cluster program will be completed in 2009. The World Bank\u2019s implementation completion report for \nDPL 1\u20134 has yet to be completed. \n ", " \nTable 5: Indicative Triggers for DPSP-5 and Potential Triggers for DPSP-6  2\n8\n   \nPolicy Aim  DPSP-5  DPSP-6 \nPolicy Area 1: Improving the investment climate \nPolicy Subarea 1.1: Improving the regulatory environment for investment \n1.1.1 Reduce uncertainty for investors by  a.

Financing Plan \n82.  The Government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources for the DPSP-4. The DPSP-4 provides parallel cofinancing for the World Bank-\nsupported DPL-5, for which the Government has requested $750 million. The loan will have a \n15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per annum;17 conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the draft \nLoan Agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft program Loan Agreement. The Government has made its \nown independent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given \nan undertaking that this choice was not made on the basis of any advice from ADB. Responding \nfavorably to the Government\u2019s request will signal ADB\u2019s relevance in an emerging, confident, \nand well-performing middle-income country. In addition, the Government intends to request \n$100 million from the Government of Japan for parallel cofinancing of the DPL-5. \n \n83.  Gross financing needs of the Government have increased from $11.5 billion in 2006 to \n$15.5 billion in 2007 and an estimated $17.5 billion in 2008. This reflects a higher fiscal deficit \nand high levels of domestic and foreign debt principal repayment. The Government has sought \nabout $3.0 billion in program loan and budget support operations from development partners: \nADB ($850 million); Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement ($200 million); Japan ($500 million); \nand the World Bank ($1.6 billion). For the proposed DPL-5, the World Bank envisages providing \na $750 million program loan on International Bank for Reconstruction and Development terms. \nADB\u2019s proposed support is based on the strengths of the policy package, its development \nimpact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  and  the  investment  needs.  Besides,  the \nGovernment  will  incur  cash  outlays  in  excess  of  $200  million  to  implement  many  of  the \ninstitutional strengthening measures supported under the DPSP-4, such as fully operationalizing \nthe NSW for clearance of merchandise and the proposed national procurement office. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n84.  The  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  will  be  the  Executing  Agency, \ncollaborating closely with MOF. Implementation of DPL-5/DPSP-4 actions is coordinated with a \nnumber of other ministries and agencies, including Bappenas, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of \nCooperatives and SME, and Bank Indonesia.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n85.  The program implementation period for the DPSP-4 is from January to December 2008.  \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n86.  The  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding the items specified in the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 8) and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with ADB provisions for \n                                                 \n \n17 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors has discounted the commitment charge to 0.15%, and waived the front-end fee of 1.00% \nfor loans approved from 1 July 2007 up to and including 30 June 2009.   \n ", "31 \nsimplifying disbursement of program loans,18 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired if during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its \ncompliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required.  \n4.  Anticorruption  \n87.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. In addition, the DPSP-4 \nhas a core focus on improving governance and anticorruption. It promotes transparency in PFM. \nNoteworthy progress has been achieved through the TSA system and in the implementation of \ntransparent accountability arrangements for central government investment funding (RDI) and \nregional development accounts, which will help the Government in its anticorruption efforts. The \nprogram\u2019s focus on tax audit procedures, simplifying and/or eliminating unnecessary business \nlicenses, and implementing good corporate governance in state-owned banks will also further \nthe Government\u2019s anticorruption agenda and improve the investment climate. \n \n88.  The Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \nand  overall  PFM,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the  Government  Financial \nManagement  and  Revenue  Administration  Project  and  from  ADB  through  the  State  Audit \nReform  Sector  Development  Program. 19  Reforms  and  capacity  development  initiatives \nsupported under both these programs have led to initial progress in strengthening PFM. \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n89.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill nominate a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will \nbe managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n90.  The Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs, MOF, and Bappenas will continuously \nmonitor implementation of the DPL-related reforms and their impacts, in line with the overall \nprogram framework and outcome/output indicators agreed upon with the Government. The \nevaluation of the triggers is also done by the participating development partners based on \nfrequent discussions with key government counterparts, and the collection of evidence in the \nform of key implementation decrees, circulars, etc.  \n                                                 \n \n18 ADB. 1998.

The key benefits expected from implementation of the Program are: \n \n(i)  progress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term objectives through improved \n(a) investment climate, (b) public financial management and governance, and \n(c) service delivery to the poor; \n(ii)  raising the profile of key issues at the ministerial level, accelerating the timetable \nfor  policy  actions  to  be  taken,  addressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic \nbottlenecks, and providing an impetus for decision makers to further coordinate \nacross economic and line ministries; \n(iii)  sustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional reform agenda (with the DPSP-4 providing for policy continuity and \nconsistency in sectors where ADB has been actively involved); \n(iv)  aid harmonization and cofinancing by the key development partners (ADB, World \nBank,  and  Government  of  Japan)  around  a  common  policy  framework  and \ndialogue, and the resulting endorsement of the Government\u2019s macroeconomic \nmanagement; and \n(v)  facilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or planning support. \n \n92.  Institutional. Significant benefits stem from the engagement of Indonesia\u2019s three main \ndevelopment  partners.  Participation  in  the  DPL  series  has  helped  in  overall  institutional \ncoordination  among  the  partners  as  well  as  between  the  Government  and  the  partners. \nProvision  of  advisory  support  through  TA  has  also  been  significantly  streamlined  and \ncoordinated to best meet the Government\u2019s needs. The measures supported under the DPSP \ncluster will result in sustained institutional capacity in such key areas of policy formulation as \nfiscal policy, debt and treasury management, and public expenditure and financial management. \n \n93.  Social. The main contribution of support being leveraged through the DPSPs is in the \nform of improved public administration, sustaining effective public expenditure reorientation \ntoward  productive  needs,  and  continuously  supporting  government  measures  to  align  its \nresources effectively with its medium-term objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. \nBy focusing on supporting strategic reforms aimed at improving public service delivery, the \nProgram will have direct beneficial social impact. Appendix 8 presents a summary poverty \nreduction and social impact mitigation strategy. \n \n94.  Economic. The nature of the DPSP series limits the scope for quantitative economic \nanalysis.  However,  qualitative  assessment  of  the  Program\u2019s  outcomes  and  impacts  was \nassessed in terms of effect channels, stakeholder groups, and the expected time needed for \neffects to occur. In terms of effect channels, the Program will impact largely through lower \nbusiness  transaction  costs,  improved  access  to  assets  (specifically  capital  for  SME),  and \nprogressive improvements to both the quantity and quality of public services (including better \ntargeting of such services to the poor). In terms of time, the net effect of lower business \ntransaction  costs  from  regulatory  reform,  and  reduced  times  for  business  licensing,  VAT \nrefunds, and import and export applications through the NSW are expected to be realized \nprogressively over the medium term in the form of improved growth and poverty outcomes by \nindirectly encouraging competition and investment. The net effect of improved access to finance \n ", "33 \nfor SME is to reduce poverty indirectly through additional growth, to the extent that access to \nfinance is a constraint to SME development. Initially, the main beneficiaries would be SME and \nlarger enterprises, with benefits filtering to the wider population through increased employment \ngeneration. Indicators and the evidence base of effects of lower transaction costs, and improved \naccess to financing of SME will be government agency surveys, competitiveness surveys, and \ncost-of-doing-business  surveys.  The  net  effect  of  reforms  to  the  budget  formulation  and \nexecution  process\u2014through  more  results-oriented  budget  documents,  improved  cash \nmanagement, smoother disbursements of capital expenditures, and strengthened accounting \ncapabilities in line ministries\u2014is to improve budget allocations and operational efficiency with a \npossible increase in local service outlays, and reduction in corruption. This is likely to be \nenhanced  in  the  medium  to  longer  term,  with  the  progression  toward  medium-term  and \nperformance budgeting, especially after full adoption of the MTEF approach in the next 5-year \nplan. Increases in the 2008 PNPM are expected to have a more immediate effect through \nincreased  block  grant  transfers  for  subdistrict-led  community  development  projects,  while \ninstitutionalizing poverty program evaluations and assessments would lead to increased and \nbetter targeted programs in the near to medium term. Increasing the number of teaching hours \nby qualified teachers could have potential long-term impacts, to the extent that it increases \neducational outcomes\u2014indicators and the evidence base are public expenditure reviews, civil \nservice performance reviews, and benefit incidence surveys.  From a distribution point of view, \nthe programs\u2019 near-term impact on the poor will be realized mostly through the 2008 PNPM \nblock grant increases, while improved service access and delivery for poorer groups will be \nrealized over the medium to longer term. \n \n95.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. Implementation of the DPSP-4 \nmeasures will cause no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues \naffecting  indigenous  peoples.  Based  on  desk  review,  the  measures  supported  under  the        \nDPSP-4 are unlikely to have any adverse environmental impacts. \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n96.  Implementation of the DPSP cluster is subject to the following risks: \n \n(i)  External vulnerabilities. With improvements in its macroeconomic indicators, \nIndonesia\u2019s  resilience  to  external  shocks  has  increased.  Factors  limiting  the \npotential impacts of external shocks include diversity of exports, limited external \ndebt exposure, and an adequate level of reserves. The banking sector is also \nnow sufficiently strong to weather a moderate external shock. The maintenance \nof a financial sector safety net supported by the DPL/DPSP will help to improve \nthe resilience of the banking sector. Nevertheless, risks remain high, especially \nduring  a  period  of  global  financial  turmoil.  Indonesia  is  a  financially  open \neconomy and there are significant foreign holdings, especially in the stock market \nand government bonds. Indonesia is thus vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor \nsentiment. If significant funds are pulled back because of liquidity demands in the \nUS and elsewhere and/or increased emerging market risk aversion, this could \nlead to increased pressure on domestic interest and exchange rates. In addition, \nthe Government has large gross financing needs over the next few years, and \ntighter credit markets and increased risk aversion could limit the Government\u2019s \nability to tap international financial markets. This could force the Government to \ncut budgetary outlays to maintain fiscal balance, with adverse consequences for \ninfrastructure  and  social  expenditure.  Mitigating  these  risks  will  require  solid \ncooperation between Bank Indonesia and the economic ministries to reassure \n ", "34  \nbondholders  that  their  investments  are  safe  (from  inflation  and  exchange \nmovements) while crowding in private investment to the extent possible through \nthe kinds of structural reforms supported by the DPL/DPSP. \n(ii)  Subsidies. As international oil prices decline, subsides also fall but they remain \na key risk as commodity price reversions also remain possible. There remain \nsignificant subsidies on fuel and electricity in Indonesia, despite the increase in \nadministered fuel prices in May 2008. Fixed fuel prices and the subsidies they \ncreate represent a threat to fiscal sustainability in the longer term (not to mention \ntheir  opportunity  cost, regressivity,  and  that  they  do  not  promote  efficiency). \nWhile a plan to move to market prices would be best, this is on hold until after the \nelection in 2009. In the meantime, there are ongoing efforts to reduce subsidies \nin other ways. \n(iii)  Fiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements under way, there are \ncontinuing  concerns  regarding  utilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall \nfiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  country  financial \naccountability  assessment)  have  indicated  considerable  improvements  in  the \noverall  fiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by \nseveral  development  partners  provide  significant  TA  support  to  strengthen \nfiduciary  governance.  The  DPL/DPSP  focus  on  strengthening  budget \npreparation,  execution,  and  transparency  in  financial  management  will \nsignificantly enhance transparency. \n(iv)  The  2009  legislative  and  presidential  elections. Although the Government \nremains committed to sustaining its economic reform agenda despite the global \neconomic slowdown and general elections next year, elections often reduce the \ntime horizons of politicians, leading them to avoid new policy initiatives in the pre-\nelection period and shifting their focus to populist short-term measures. This \ncould undermine the reform agenda contained in the DPSP-4. There is, however, \nalso  the  possibility  of  a  countervailing  tendency  where  the  prospect  of \napproaching elections spurs political entrepreneurs into more clearly establishing \nreform credentials and recording clear accomplishments. \n(v)  Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional \nconflicts and terrorism could slow foreign direct investment and set back the \nrecovering tourism industry. The Government and law enforcement authorities \nhave  taken  a  range  of  measures  aimed  at  rebuilding  public  and  investor \nconfidence. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n97.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the development needs as outlined \nunder DPSP-4 implementation arrangements.  \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the DPSP-4 loan agreement, \nas described in the development policy letter (including the policy matrix), will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of ADB\u2019s engagement in the DPL series, \nand subsequently. \n ", "35 \nVII.

Core Policy Area 1: Macroeconomic Stability \n \n1.  The  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)/Development  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP) \nseries  sought  to  improve  debt  management  and  fiscal  policy  management  by  reducing \nsubsidies  to  the  nonpoor  and  making  revenue  administration  more  efficient  through  the \nexpansion of modern tax officers. \n \n2.  Overall  macroeconomic  fundamentals  remain  sound  and  fiscal  consolidation  has \nimproved  with  the  expansion  of  the  tax  base  and  improved  efficiency.  Economic  growth \naveraged a substantive 5.6% during 2004\u20132007, the debt\u2013gross domestic product (GDP) ratio \ndeclined nearly 25 percentage points, budget deficits have declined, and high reserves provide \nthe country with a comfortable liquidity cushion. Increasing non-oil and gas revenues as a \npercentage of GDP were supported by a prior DPL/DPSP action to expand modernization of tax \noffices and the tax base, including to medium and small taxpayers. These taxpayers are now \nresponsible  for  the  largest  share  of  Indonesian  taxes.  Additional  reforms  to  improve  tax \nanalysis, including the creation of a Tax Policy Office, are expected to generate improvements \nin revenue collection.  \n \n3.  On the expenditure side, reductions in non-targeted fuel subsidies in 2005 allowed \ngreater social spending but untargeted subsidies remain burdensome. In 2005, the Government \nraised fuel prices, resulting in the decline of fuel subsidies from 4% of GDP in 2004 to 2.7% in \n2007, freeing up $10 billion a year. This amount was rolled out into cash transfers targeted at \nthe poor and also higher health and education expenditures. However, as oil prices continued to \nbreak record highs throughout 2008, fuel subsidies rose sharply, causing the Government to \nspend an additional Rp50 trillion (1.2% of GDP) in the first part of the year. In May 2008, the \nGovernment again increased fuel prices by almost 30% and accompanied this with a widely \npublicized and improved cash transfer program. This move, together with the recent reduction in \noil prices, has brought down the projected energy subsidy in 2008 to 4.7% of GDP, which still \nsurpasses both central government capital and social spending by 1.7% of GDP. \n \n4.  Rating  agencies  responded  favorably  to  Indonesia\u2019s  lower  debt  ratio  and  reform \npackages. In a reflection of the country\u2019s more sound economic footing, all three credit agencies \nhave raised their credit ratings at least three notches since 2003. Standard and Poor\u2019s upgraded \nIndonesia\u2019s credit rating from CCC+ in 2003 to BB\u2013 by 2008; likewise in this period, Moody\u2019s \nraised its ratings from B2 to Ba3; and Fitch raised its from B to BB. In supporting their ratings \nupgrades, the agencies cited debt reduction as the primary cause, as well as the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to broad-based reform, including changes to investment laws, customs and tax \nreforms, and fiscal reforms, specifically in treasury and budget\u2014measures supported by the \nDPL/DPSP series.  \n \nB.  Core Policy Area 2: Investment Climate \n \n5.  The DPL/DPSP series sought to improve the investment climate through several key \nentry areas, including regulatory reform, tax, custom and trade reform, financial sector stability, \nand improved access to finance by small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n6.  Though  initially  slow  to  pick  up  momentum,  the  Government  has  made  strides  in \nimproving the investment environment. Although full implementation of the investment packages \n ", "46    Appendix 3 \nhas yet to take place, initial signs are encouraging\u2014investment rates have risen from below \n20% of GDP in 2003 to 25% in 2007. In 2006, the Government issued three economic policy \npackages  covering  investment  climate,  infrastructure,  and  financial  reform.  In  2007,  a \ncomprehensive follow-up package was issued detailing 168 specific reform measures to be \ncarried out. As a result, business perceptions have improved. A study of manufacturing firms in \nmid-2007  indicated  improvements  in  value-added  tax  (VAT)  refunds,  tax  filing  processes, \ninformal payments, and faster import and custom clearance. Labor issues and infrastructure \nhave now replaced consistency of regulation as the key constraint to doing business. Surveys of \nforeign investors also show that perceptions of Indonesia are improving. In Japan\u2019s annual \nJapan Bank of International Cooperation survey of 600 Japanese multinational companies, \nIndonesia was ranked the eighth most promising country for overseas business.  \n \n7.  Regulatory reforms supported by the DPL/DPSP process, particularly those relating to \nsimplifying  and  eliminating  unnecessary  business  licenses  and  multiple  registration \nrequirements, have led to more streamlined procedures supportive of the investment climate. \nAccording to Doing Business 2009, the time to set up a business has fallen significantly from \n168 days in 2003 to 105 days in 2007, and 76 days in 2008. Another key achievement was the \npassage of the Investment Law, which clarified previously arbitrary investment rules. The law \nfocuses on equal treatment of foreign and domestic investment, removes the forced divestment \nand limited duration of foreign investment in the old law, lengthens the time horizon to hold land, \nliberalizes some immigration procedures, and allows for international arbitration.  \n \n8.  Tax reform has addressed some of the key complaints from the business community. \nReforms in tax administration have halved the time for VAT refunds; in addition, more than \nRp10 trillion (roughly $1 billion) in outstanding VAT refunds have been settled. New procedures \nhave been set in place to issue VAT refunds to export companies within set time frames. \nStandard operation procedures for a complaint management system have been issued. The \nDPL/DPSP has also supported the issuance of a decree on tax audit procedures that allows \ntaxpayers to delay payment of tax assessments from disputed audits. However, this decree only \nbecomes effective for disputes over 2008 assessments and forward, leaving those with current \ndisputes under the old rule. \n \n9.  Significant progress on trade and customs reform has been made with pilot testing of \nIndonesia\u2019s national single window (NSW) and paperless import clearance. Implementation of \nthe NSW is one of the country\u2019s most important trade facilitation initiatives. Under a single \nwindow, exporters and importers will no longer be required to apply individually to multiple \nagencies\u2014significantly reducing the number of days it takes to export and import goods. A pilot \nproject is under way in Jakarta\u2019s main port and will be expanded to other ports in preparation for \nthe establishment of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) single window. Other \ntrade reforms sought by the DPL aimed to improve the technical capacity of the tariff team in \nsetting and evaluating tariff changes and nontariff barriers imposed by line ministries. \n \n10.  The original objectives of the DPL/DPSP series were to strengthen the financial sector \nby reducing the role of state-owned banks and increasing the share of financial assets at \nnonbank financial institutions. The share of state-owned banks in the banking system (36% in \nJune 2008) was a significant 10 percentage point decrease since 2003, indicating the increasing \nrole  of  private  banks  in  the  sector.  Less  progress  was  made  on  the  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions\u2014their  share  of  19.9%  of  total  financial  sector  assets  in  March  2008  was  little \nimproved from the 17.4% share of 2005. However, other indicators point to a healthier financial \nsystem\u2014 profitability ratios such as net interest margin, return on assets, and return on equity \nremain strong. Nonperforming loans, particularly in state-owned banks have been substantially \n ", "Appendix  3  47 \nreduced after peaking in 2005. In terms of diversification, small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SME) lending has been rising rapidly and now accounts for a majority share of the lending \nportfolio.  \n \n11.  In  strengthening  the  stability  of  the  financial  sector,  the  DPL/DPSP  supported  the \nimplementation of a sounder financial safety net. At the start of the DPL series, there was a \nneed to reduce the economic distortion and potential moral hazard caused by the then existing \nblanket guarantee, which had been introduced during the Asian crisis to stem bank runs. To this \neffect, the DPL/DPSP series supported a number of reforms, including a deposit insurance \nscheme,  institutionalizing  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  role  as  lender  of  last  resort,  and  establishing \ninstitutional  processes  and  mechanisms  for  resolving  troubled  banks.  By  the  end  of  the        \nDPL-4/DPSP-3,  coverage  on  deposits  was  reduced  from  a  blanket  guarantee  in  2003  to \nRp100 million by 2007. Indonesia is one of the few countries in the world that has removed its \nblanket guarantee on schedule. \n \nC.  Core Policy Area 3: Public Financial Management and Governance \n \n12.  To  improve  the  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  public  finances,  the \nDPL/DPSP  series  focused  on  three  key  areas  of  reform:  (i)  modernizing  public  financial \nmanagement  systems,  (ii)  strengthening  institutional  reform  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF), and more recently (iii) civil service reform.  \n \n13.  Changes in the legal and regulatory architecture for public financial management (PFM) \nare now largely complete and the focus is on implementing a modern PFM system. Before the \nstart of the DPL/DPSP series, the Government\u2019s financial operations were based on outdated \nlaws (from 1925) that had been updated with a series of inadequate decrees. The previous PFM \nsystem  allowed  for  systematic  and  pervasive  corruption,  collusion,  and  nepotism  because \nassignments were unclear, transparency was low, and enforcement poor. Budget formulation \nwas opaque and inefficient, making it difficult to quantify basic concepts of the budget. Budget \nexecution was often delayed and monitoring arrangements were weak. Procurement processes \nwere prone to corruption and collusion. Accounting and reporting were fragmented and not \nalways reliable, and mandates of government audit bodies were not clearly defined. The DPL \nsupported various regulatory measures needed to create the regulatory framework for a more \nmodern PFM system, in the areas of budget preparation and execution.  \n \n14.  A key achievement under the DPL/DPSP has been the implementation of the treasury \nsingle account (TSA) to improve cash management of public finances. At the start of the DPL \nseries, more than 18,000 commercial bank accounts\u2014and other accounts not even known to \nthe Treasury\u2014handled government funds. As an initial step, the DPL-1 supported addressing \nthe regulatory deficiencies in the PFM system, including the passage of several laws defining \nthe regulatory framework. Reorganization of MOF was also carried out to begin the process of \nestablishing a TSA, and to clean up the cash management issues the Government faced. The \nDPL-2/DPSP-1  then  supported  the  implementing  regulations  underlining  these  laws  and \nadopted an implementation plan. The DPL-3/DPSP-2 pilot tested the TSA to have zero-balance \naccounts in over 50 provincial treasury offices (KPPNs). The DPL-4/DPSP-3 extended the TSA \ncoverage to nearly full implementation on government expenditure accounts. Although there \nwere some timing issues (e.g., training for local agencies to implement the TSA came after the \nrequirement to do so), the push to meet the deadline of the DPL accelerated implementation of \nthe  TSA.  Progress  on  covering  revenue  accounts  has  been  more  complicated,  but  has \ncommenced. \n \n ", "48    Appendix 3 \n15.  Budgeting  procedures  have  improved  but  execution  remains  problematic.  The \nDPL/DPSP has helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across the \nbudget cycle. The national budget is now compatible with the international standard government \nfinancial statistics (GFS) classification. Fiscal reporting is more comprehensive and timely. \nElements of a medium-term expenditure framework have been introduced, though not fully \noperational in the budget system. Whereas the planning and reporting side of the budget \nprocess has improved, executing the budget has remained weak, with about 50% of capital \nexpenditure being spent in the last quarter.  \n \n16.  Procurement reform, though slow to take off, now has the potential to exceed original \nexpectations. The original trigger aimed only at strengthening the existing National Procurement \nOffice. Instead, the Government has made it into an independent office responsible directly to \nthe  President.  As  an  independent  agency  with  adequate  resources,  authority,  and  strong \npolitical backing, it will be in a stronger position to drive public procurement reform. However, \nbecause of the lag in strengthening the National Public Procurement Office (LKPP), there was a \nlack of progress on other procurement reforms, especially in developing a comprehensive \nnational  public  sector  procurement  law.  This  law  is  needed  to  address  the  numerous \ninconsistencies resulting from decentralization reforms, which have enabled various government \nlevels to issue their own procurement procedures. Other deficiencies of the system include slow \nprogress in the passage of regulations, and the adoption of standard tools such as bidding \ndocuments and user manuals. \n \n17.  Initial steps to address civil service reform have been launched. Lack of administrative \ncapacity  and  distorted  incentives  in  government  bureaucracy  have  constrained  policy \nimplementation as well as delivery of public services. As an initial step to reform the civil \nservice, the DPL/DPSP supported development of a comprehensive reform of the structure and \nremuneration framework for high-ranking state officials. A task force was set up to examine the \nentire compensation package with the goal of creating a more transparent, systematic, and \ncoherent framework for pay and allowances based on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay \ngrading. Building on this, MOF has developed a comprehensive civil service reform plan and \naction plan for itself, which is now being pilot-tested to other agencies.  \n \nD.  Core Policy Area 4: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n \n18.  The groundwork for improving poverty targeting of basic services has been initiated. \nPrior to the 2005 fuel prices rise, Indonesia\u2019s social protection system was characterized by \nemergency short-term safety net programs and price subsidies. The country\u2019s three targeted \nprograms accounted for less than 0.5% of GDP, compared to almost 4.0% of GDP for the \nuntargeted fuel subsides, of which less than 0.2% of GDP went to the poorest quintile. As the \nfuel price hike made available more funds for social spending, the DPL supported building \ncapacity to create a more evaluative institutional framework that would improve the targeting of \nthese released funds. The 2005 fuel hike was accompanied by a new cash transfer program to \nhelp alleviate the impact on the poorest households\u2014representing a substantial shift from the \nineffective and inefficient general subsidy program. Evaluative assessments were conducted to \nimprove  targeting  and  performance  of  the  cash  transfer  program,  and  the  lessons  were \nincorporated into the new cash transfer program that accompanied the May 2008 fuel price \nincrease.  The  Government  has  undertaken  significant  steps  to  set  up  an  effective  and \ncomprehensive monitoring and evaluation function, including the establishment of a unit to \nundertake performance evaluations, with the intent of having the findings used as an input to the \nGovernment\u2019s planning and budgeting cycle. \n ", "  Appendix 4  49   \nLETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY  \n \n ", "50   Appendix 4 \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  51   \n \n \n ", "52   Appendix 4 \n \n ", "       \nPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE FOURTH DEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM \nDPSP-4 Policy Measures  Status as of the end of October 2008 \nCore Policy Area I: Improved Investment Climate \nA.

Background and Analytical Underpinnings \n \n1.  The Fifth Development Policy Loan and Fourth Development Policy Support Program \nprovides  general  budget  support  to  the  Government  and  will  be  executed  through  the \nGovernment\u2019s public financial management systems. This appendix summarizes the current \nstate of these systems and the ongoing reforms, with a view to assessing the fiduciary risks \nrelating  to  the  proceeds  of  this  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  and  Development  Policy \nSupport Program (DPSP). \n \n2.  Public  financial  management  (PFM)  systems  in  Indonesia  have  strengths  and \nweaknesses. Strengths include a sound regulatory framework across most parts of the budget \ncycle; an orderly, transparent, and predictable budget formulation process; fund predictability for \nbudget  execution;  sound  budget  classification;  comprehensive  and  transparent  budget \ndocumentation;  government  accounting  standards  aligned  with  comparable  international \nstandards; a chart of accounts that is broadly consistent with the Government Finance Statistics \nManual (GFSM 2001); and a strengthened external audit institution.  \n \n3.  These strong points are the result of a concerted reform effort among key stakeholders \nto the budget process since the political transition in 1998. These efforts were given momentum \nand direction in the 2001 white paper on PFM reform. \n \n4.  DPLs 1\u20134 and DPSP 1\u20133 have had public financial management as an area of focus \nand have contributed to some of the significant improvements made in the last few years. \nDetails of results achieved in the DPL process are discussed in Appendix 3 under core policy \narea 3.  \n \n5.  Key stakeholders to the budget process remain committed to further reform through an \nevolving  and  pragmatic  reform  agenda.  The  focus  of  government  reform  is  on  the \nimplementation of an integrated financial management information system, further unification of \nthe budget, further improvement of the chart of accounts, restructuring of budget programs, the \nintroduction  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)  and  performance-based \nbudgeting, a full rollout of the treasury single account (TSA), improvement of the institutional \nand regulatory framework for procurement, improvements to cash and asset management, \ninternal controls, and internal and external audit.  \n \n6.  The assessment draws on recent economic and sector work undertaken by the World \nBank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), and other development partners. A public expenditure \nand  financial  accountability  assessment  was  concluded  in  June  2008.  In  addition,  this \nassessment  has  taken  into  account  the  findings  of  a  joint  World  Bank\u2013IMF  mission  on \nstrengthening budget management undertaken in June 2008, the results of a previous joint \nWorld Bank\u2014IMF mission on budget reform priorities reported to the Government in June 2007, \nthe September 2008 update of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes on Fiscal \nTransparency in Indonesia from 20061 and an ADB sector report on accountability and audit in \n                                                 \n \n1 IMF. 2006.

Significant advances have been made in budget preparation\u2014instituting a state budget \n(which combines the previous separate recurrent and development budgets) and improvements \nin budget transparency. However, problems in budget execution persist with 50% of the capital \nexpenditure still being spent in the last quarter. The Treasury has conducted a survey of the \nimpediments to the disbursement of budgetary funds through questionnaires. The results of the \nsurvey  are  being  reviewed  and  will  form  the  basis  of  an  action  plan  to  smooth  out \ndisbursements during the fiscal year.  \n \n8.  Implementation of a TSA, as foreseen by State Treasury Law No. 1/2004, is ongoing. \nThe Treasury, in cooperation with Bank Indonesia, is pilot testing the daily sweep of government \nrevenue deposits from collecting branches and post offices into the TSA. Depending on the \nsuccess of the pilot, the daily sweep will be extended to all commercial bank branches starting \nin January 2009. The public procurement environment has improved in the last few years but \nthere are still weaknesses in its regulatory and implementation aspects. Presidential Decree \nNo. 106/2007 was signed in December 2007, establishing the National Public Procurement \nOffice (LKPP) an independent agency responsible for planning and development of strategies, \npolicies, and regulations associated with procurement using public funds. Making the newly \nestablished LKPP operational by recruiting staff and allocating budget is a priority.  \n \n9.  The government accounting standards are well aligned with comparable international \nstandards (IPSAs). The chart of accounts is broadly consistent with GFSM 2001. The aggregate \ngovernment annual financial statements have been prepared in a timely manner for 4 years. \nHowever, there are reliability questions. The Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) has for the last \n4 years  issued  a  disclaimer  opinion  on  these  financial statements,  citing  reasons  such  as \ninternal control weaknesses in the preparation of the financial statements and instances of \nnoncompliance with applicable regulations.  \n \n10.  The Government\u2019s internal audit framework is extensive but the institutional structure is \ncomplex. Government Regulation No. 60/2008 on government internal controls defines more \nclearly the roles and responsibilities of different players in internal audit. The overall internal \ncontrol framework continues to be weak, with paper-intensive processes and inefficient use of \nhuman  resources.  The  Government  is  preparing  for  the  implementation  of  an  integrated \nfinancial management system (SPAN) to replace the multitude of financial data processing \napplications currently used by government institutions.  \n \n11.  BPK has received a significant increase in its operating budget to fund an increase in the \nnumber of auditors as well as regional offices. The audit report on the financial statements is \n                                                 \n \n2 ADB. 2007. Sector Report on Accountability and Audit in Indonesia.

Since then, improvements are \ngradually being made to the organization, with new hires and training. BPK has a follow-up peer \nreview planned for FY2009.  \n \n12.  Powerful independent oversight and prosecutorial institutions such as the Corruption \nEradication Commission (KPK) and the Anti-Corruption Court have begun to deliver tangible \nresults.  High-profile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched,  leading  to  a  number  of \nsuccessful prosecutions.  \n \n13.  Parliamentary  oversight  of  budget  processes  has  been  strengthened.  Parliamentary \ncommissions have become particularly active in scrutinizing and amending the Government\u2019s \ndraft  annual  budget.  The  Government  published  an  IMF  fiscal  transparency  report  and \nundertook its socialization throughout Indonesia. The public availability of fiscal information is \nimproving and the Government published a fiscal risk statement together with the 2008 budget.  \n \n14.  These reforms directly influence the environment in which public expenditure is planned, \nbudgeted,  executed,  and  accounted  for  across  all  levels  of  government.  A  more  detailed \ncommentary on progress in implementing these reforms is given in this Appendix below to help \nidentify the risks arising from the Government\u2019s capacity to manage this loan and determine the \nfiduciary arrangements for this operation.  \n \nC.  Reforming Budget Formulation \n \n15.  Fiscal  relationships  between  the  executive  and  legislature  are  defined  in  the  State \nFinance Law No.17/2003. The House of Representatives (DPR) is the main legislative body and \nplays  a  significant  role  in  shaping  the  budget  and  fiscal  policy.  The  budget  is  passed  in \nagreement between the President and DPR. The process involves an examination by DPR of \nthe  macroeconomic  framework,  macro-fiscal  policies,  and  detailed  budget  allocations.  The \nbudget  has  been  the  centerpiece  of  strengthening  the  legislature  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  executive \nfollowing political transitions after 1998; the roles of the executive and legislative branches in \nthis area are evolving. \n \n16.  The  budget  documentation  is  comprehensive.  The  main  outstanding  area  of \nimprovement is explanation of the expenditure implications of new policy initiatives.  \n \n17.  Laws governing budget management clearly specify the responsibilities of the minister of \nfinance, and comprehensive regulations have been developed. While the President, as head of \nthe  Government,  has  overall  authority  to  exercise  national  fiscal  management,  the  State \nFinance Law No. 17/2003 clearly delegates the responsibility of overall fiscal management of \ncentral government finances to the minister of finance as chief financial officer. It also assigns \nresponsibilities  to  individual  ministers,  governors,  and  other  local  authorities  for  financial \nmanagement and accountability in their jurisdictions. \n \n18.  Provisions of the new regulations are being implemented. Budget classification and \nexecution is based on administrative, economic, and functional classification consistent with the \nClassification of the Functions of Government and GFSM 2001. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nis developing plans for an MTEF to guide budget policy. \n \n19.  Forward estimates at the aggregate level were introduced with the 2008 budget and are \nbeing included in the 2009 budget as well. Efforts in the National Development Planning Agency \n ", "Appendix 8  63 \n(Bappenas) and MOF are ongoing to redefine the budget program structure and to develop \ntemplates  and  manuals  for  an  MTEF  and  performance-based  budgeting.  The  efforts  are \nplanned to be piloted in the coming years. The level of extra-budgetary expenditures is not \nknown and the issue is not on the reform agenda.  \n \nD.  Reforming Budget Execution \n \n20.  Indonesia still spends 50% of its total capital expenditure in the final quarter of the year.4 \nFor the past 6 years, spending has always started slowly and then accelerated toward the end \nof each year. This spending pattern is of concern because project implementation is disrupted \nby an adverse cycle. Moreover, under-spending on capital expenditure constrains increases in \ninfrastructure investment. Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms of more severe \nchallenges that are encountered at each stage of the public expenditure management cycle. \n \n21.  The Government maintains a comparatively rigid budget execution process. Detailed \ninput controls aim to ensure that the composition of the budget complies with political priorities \nand that the budget is not altered during execution. Spending warrants (DIPAs), while now \nissued at the start of the fiscal year, contain excessive amounts of detail leaving little flexibility \nfor adjustments in the composition of inputs needed to carry out a given activity. Reallocations \nacross DIPAs, from delayed programs to better-performing ones that could enhance satisfactory \nimplementation  of  the  overall  expenditure  program,  require  lengthy  revision,  sometimes \ninvolving Parliament. Such inflexibility creates practical difficulties and inefficiencies. \n \n22.  With expanding fiscal space, public investment is increasing, putting additional pressure \non PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment is more demanding than current or \nmandatory expenditure.  \n \nE.  Reforming Treasury, Cash, and Asset Management \n \n23.  Transparency is still weakened by a multitude of bank accounts. Directorate General \n(DG) Treasury maintains multiple bank accounts, both in rupiah and foreign currency, at Bank \nIndonesia.  External audit reports from 2004 to 2006 noted that about 4,600 bank accounts have \nnot been reported to DG Treasury. By the end of December 2007, MOF completed a census of \nall government accounts and identified 32,570 accounts. Subsequently, 2,086 accounts were \nclosed.  Efforts  are  ongoing  to  determine  which  of  the  remaining  30,484  accounts  can  be \nincluded in the TSA regime, either directly or through a mechanism of daily sweeps into the \nTSA.  \n \n24.  Regulations associated with Law No. 1/2004 will address this weakness and provide for \n(i) the installation of TSA at Bank Indonesia; (ii) the conversion of operational bank accounts at \ncommercial banks into zero-balance transit accounts; and (iii) a mandatory review at MOF of \nbank accounts of all state agencies outside DG Treasury oversight, with a view to closing all \nthose that do not serve the public interest. Pilot runs for testing zero-balance arrangements with \ncommercial banks for the expenditure accounts have been successful. The rollout of TSA to the \nrevenue  accounts,  which  was  initially  scheduled  for  the  first  quarter  of  2008,  has  been \npostponed because of pending negotiations with Bank Indonesia and commercial banks on \ninterest payment for government balances held at Bank Indonesia and remuneration of banking \nservices by the Government. The Treasury is pilot testing the daily sweep of government \n                                                 \n \n4 World Bank. 2007. Indonesia Public Expenditure Review 2007: Spending for Development. Washington DC.  \n ", "64   Appendix 8 \nrevenue deposits from collecting branches and post offices into the TSA with Bank Indonesia. \nThe pilot is currently being tested in six branches of six commercial banks and a few post \noffices, and three government treasury offices (KPPNs). Depending on the result of the test, the \ndaily sweep is planned to be extended to all commercial bank branches starting in January \n2009. The daily sweep will be with respect to deposits made the previous day, not on the same \nday. This is because the commercial banks have agreed not to charge for this service, provided \nthe sweep is done the following day. This would be a significant improvement compared to the \ncurrent practice, established in 1989, of sweeping the revenue accounts twice a week. \n \n25.  The implementing regulation for Law No. 1/2004, Government Regulation No. 36/2007 \non Cash Management, was issued in July 2007 detailing the governance and set-up of cash \nmanagement. In addition, a number of MOF regulations (PMK) have been issued to further the \nestablishment of the TSA: \n \n(i)  PMK 57 is the generic PMK to regulate opening of bank accounts by the line \nministries.  \n(ii)  PMK 58 mandates a census of the existing line ministry accounts.  \n(iii)  PMK 59 mandates echelon I officers of MOF to disclose bank accounts, if any \nare being operated.  \n \n26.1  The  cash-based  accounting  system  generates  timely  records  of  revenue  and \nexpenditure  transactions,  but  does  not  track  monthly  arrears.  Transaction  records  are \nelectronically  transmitted  to  the  directorate  of  accounts  at  DG  Treasury  headquarters  for \nconsolidation and generation of periodic reports on budget execution. However, DG Treasury \nplans to move toward an accrual recording system, which would make this possible. \n \n27.  MOF is preparing the implementation of an integrated financial management system to \nreplace the multitude of financial data processing applications currently used by government \ninstitutions. The system is known by the acronym SPAN. It will integrate and replace the \nmultiple software applications within the Treasury as well as those being implemented in the \nDG Budget to support the budget formulation process.  \n \n28.  Following some delay, the second stage bidding process for SPAN was initiated in \nAugust 2008 and the contract for the provision of turnkey services for SPAN is expected to be \nsigned by April 2009. A new management and implementation structure for the project is being \nestablished.  \n \n29.  Government assets are not comprehensively recorded, properly organized, and fairly \nvalued.  An  integrated  and  automated  asset  management  system,  which  will  enable  the \nGovernment to optimize the use of its assets across ministries and regions, will be established \nin 2009. \n \nF.  Procurement Reforms \n \n30.  The  past  few  years  have  witnessed  improvements  in  the  public  procurement \nenvironment.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement \nregulation that meets most of what is generally regarded as accepted international practice, \nincluding basic principles: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency. \nThis decree also requires that a National Public Procurement Office  (LKPP) be established as a \nregulatory  body  for  public  procurement.  With  the  introduction  of  Presidential  Decree  No. \n80/2003, a previous certification (prequalification) process for suppliers and providers of goods \n ", "Appendix 8  65 \nand services was, in most instances, abandoned by the Government. This previously led to \nsegmentation of the market, especially at the provincial level. Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 \nalso established the basis for sanctions, complaint handling, and requirements for certification of \nusers.  \n \n31.  However, the public procurement system still has significant deficiencies in its regulatory \nand, more importantly, implementation aspects. There has been delays in establishing a strong \nregulatory body; slow progress in the development of procurement regulation anchored by a \nlaw; slow progress in the development of standard tools in terms of bidding documents and \nusers manuals; weakness in procurement capacity in implementing agencies, especially at the \nprovincial and district levels; and collusion and corruption practices in the bidding process and \nconcerns over the efficiency of anticorruption and sanction measures.  \n \n32.  This is supported by the findings of some analytical tools and reports, such as the self-\ndiagnostic  assessment  conducted  by  the  LKPP  in  2007  using  the  baseline  indicators  tool \ndeveloped under the World Bank and OECD Development Assistance Committee procurement \nroundtable  initiative.  The  assessment  of  the  baseline  indicators  presents  a  snapshot \ncomparison of the actual system against the international standards or the model system that \nthe baseline indicators represent. Baseline benchmarking of Indonesia\u2019s procurement system in \nJune 2007 showed it scoring 62.5% for legislative and regulatory framework (pillar I), 55% for \ninstitutional framework and management capacity (pillar II), 59.3% for procurement operations \nand  market  practices  (pillar  III),  and  69%  for  integrity  and  transparency  of  the  public \nprocurement system (pillar IV) in comparison with recognized international standards. Other \nstudies indicate that there is significant room for improvement. \n \n33.  LKPP will be responsible for sustainable, integrated, focused, and coordinated planning \nand development of strategies, policies, regulations associated with the procurement of goods, \nworks, services using public funds. It will report directly to the President. The organization \nstructure for the new LKPP is being developed. In addition to the chairperson (who heads the \nLKPP) and an executive secretary, there will be four departments, each headed by a deputy \nwith  respective  responsibility  for  (i)  strategy  and  policy  development,  (ii)  monitoring \nandevaluation and information systems, (iii) human resources development, and (iv) legal affairs \nand settlement of objections. LKPP is currently staffing echelon II positions and is expected to \nfill all the staffing needs by the end of 2008. \n \n34.  A number of laws have been enacted since 2000 that impact, or make reference to, \npublic procurement. These include civil works, state finance, treasury, audit, and small-scale \nbusiness.  The  pace  of  Indonesia\u2019s  decentralization  reforms  has  impacted  public  sector \nprocurement at all levels of government\u2014with ministers, governors, and even mayors able to \nissue decrees, regulations, and instructions. The plethora of regulations is often inconsistent \nand  many  regulations  do  not  meet  accepted  international  practice.  Consequently,  national \nprocurement reform and the need for national procurement policies and standards are critical. \n \n35.  Indonesia\u2019s legal framework for public sector procurement can best be strengthened by \nanchoring  it  with  an  overarching  consolidated  and  comprehensive  national  public  sector \nprocurement  law  at  the  highest  level  that  (i)  establishes  the  fundamental  principles  and \nprocedures applicable to all public sector procurement; (ii) allows for the imposition of sanctions \nwhere the principles and procedures, particularly those relating to good governance and ethics, \nare not met; (iii) amends other laws that refer to public sector procurement; and (iv) ensures that \nsuch a law has the necessary authority in a decentralized environment. LKPP is drafting a \n ", "66   Appendix 8 \nprocurement law with an expected 2-year time horizon for enactment, as it needs to undergo a \nreview and consultation process followed by submission to the Parliament. \n \n36.  Meanwhile, LKPP has consolidated the different amendments of Presidential Decree \nNo. 80/2003 into one document. It is also planning to revise this with the objective of improving \nit with possible simplification for users. \n \n37.  Standard Bidding Documents. Currently, no national standard bidding documents are \nused regularly by all government agencies in Indonesia. Some implementing agencies (such as \nthe Ministry of Public Works) have developed standard bidding documents for their own use. \nThe National Public Procurement Office, through the support of ADB, has drafted eight national \nmodel (standard) bidding documents: (i) an explanatory guide, (ii) goods with prequalification, \n(iii)  goods  with  post-qualification,  (iv)  works  with  prequalification,  (v)  works  with  post-\nqualification, (vi) other services with prequalification, (vii) other services with post-qualification, \nand (viii) consulting services. These are now available in draft form but their use is still not \nmandatory  and  they  are  being  used  on  a  pilot  basis.  It  is  important  for  LKPP  to  collect \ncomments from users on these documents, to improve them, and to mandate their use on a \nnational  basis.  One  improvement  would  be  to  harmonize  such  documents  with  those  of \ninternational  development  partners  such  as  ADB,  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (AusAID), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank. \n \n38.  Public  Procurement  Function.  There  has  been  growing  concern,  both  from  the \nGovernment and development partners, over the pace of project implementation. Significant \ndelays and slow disbursement seem to occur across the entire PFM cycle. Projects reported \ndelays  and  difficulties  in  budget  preparation  and  approval,  budget  execution,  and \nimplementation, and procurement. Specifically, there are concerns over the implementation and \nprocurement capacity of government staff and the absence of incentives for project managers \nand procurement committees. Added to this, fear of prosecution by auditors and anticorruption \nagencies has affected projects because of the reluctance of officials to take action amid growing \nworries of being prosecuted under anticorruption legislation, even over minor mistakes. LKPP is \nconsidering assessing the introduction of central procurement units at ministries and at the local \ngovernment level.  \n \n39.  Capacity Development. Presidential No. 80/2003 required the Government to adopt an \nexamination  system  and  certification  for  procurement  practitioners  within  government \ncontracting entities, to ensure that their level of competence is consistent with their level of \nresponsibilities. So far, the rate of staff passing the basic procurement certification is very low \n(less than 20%), which amplifies the need for a strategic approach to capacity development. \nLKPP is developing a strategy for human resources and training and certification on public \nprocurement,  which  will  entail  development  of  training  courses  and  criteria  for  tertiary \ninstitutions.  \n \n40.  Corruption,  Sanctions,  and  Independent  Appeals  Mechanism.  Despite \nimprovements in the public procurement system, concerns remain over corrupt and collusive \npractices. While addressing this requires an overall governance strategy, several important \nelements  in  the  procurement  system  can  support  such  a  strategy,  e.g.,  an  independent \ncomplaints mechanism, an effective sanctions mechanism, and improving transparency in the \nprocurement process through the use of e-procurement.  \n \n41.  Presidential  No.  80/2003  requires  the  establishment  of  a  complaints  handling \nmechanism. However, this is not set up independently but within each implementing agency. \n ", "Appendix 8  67 \nLKPP  is  developing  a  strategy  to  deal  with  complaints.  While  it  is  imperative  to  develop \nprocedures for an independent complaints handling mechanism, LKPP should avoid becoming \nthe agency to which these complaints are addressed but rather develop a system and monitor \nits efficiency and reliability.  \n \n42.  E-Procurement.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Ministry  of  Communications  and \nInformation,  and  the  City  of  Surabaya  have  been  at  the  forefront  in  the  development  of \nelectronic government procurement technology. LKPP is also taking the lead on behalf of the \nGovernment  for  implementation  of  electronic  government  procurement  in  Indonesia  at  the \nnational and subnational level. It is now critical to develop a road map for the development of \nelectronic government procurement in Indonesia, setting the roles of the different stakeholders, \nand the responsibility for ensuring minimum interoperability and core data standards for the \nvarious electronic government procurement providers to comply with. \n \nG.  Accounting and Reporting on Budget Execution \n \n43.  The aggregate government annual financial statements have been prepared in a timely \nmanner for 4 years (2004\u20132007). Although the timeliness is a significant achievement, concerns \nremain over their reliability. BPK has issued a disclaimer opinion on these financial statements \nfor the last 4 years. The aggregate annual financial statements present revenues, expenditures \nand transfers, surplus and deficit, and financing aggregates, compared with budget provisions. \nA balance sheet and a cash flow statement are also presented, along with a full statement of \ngovernment accounting policy.  \n \n44.  The government accounting standards are well aligned with comparable international \nstandards (IPSAs). Technical capacity constraints limit the pace at which these accounting \nstandards  can  be  implemented  at  all  levels  of  government,  including  line  ministries  and \nsubnational  governments.  Capacity  constraints  in  the  line  ministries  are  being  addressed \nthrough training of staff through an ambitious training program. The target is to train over \n7,000 accounting staff in line ministries by the end of the year\u2014at least one staff per project \nmanagement unit (satker)  by the end of FY2009.  \n \n45.  Monthly and quarterly reports on budget realization are produced by each ministry and \nsent to MOF for consolidation. A midyear unaudited report on budget realization is presented to \nDPR in July and is available to civil society. However, there are reconciliation issues between \nthe budget realization reports of the Treasury and those of the ministries. These differences are \nreported as a suspense item in the budget realization reports, which have been disclosed in the \nannual financial statements since 2004.  \n \n46.  The  Government  issued  MOF  No.  171/PMK.05/2007  on  accounting system  for  line \nministries.  \n \n47.  The changes brought about by the new regulation include emphasis on  \n \n(i)  line  ministries  being  responsible  for  recording  the  budget  allotment  for  their \nministries; and  \n \n(ii)  receivables,  payables,  and  investment  recording  by  line  ministries\u2014to  be \nrecorded and reported in the line ministries\u2019 financial statements.  \n \n ", "68   Appendix 8 \n48.  Based on the new regulations, line ministries will assume responsibility for their budget \nmonitoring (they do not have to depend on MOF controls only) and the financial statements of \nline ministries will present a more accurate picture of their financial position. \n \n49.  Although  commendable  action  has  been  taken  to  improve  government  financial \nreporting, there continue to be serious challenges in making government financial statements \nreliable, as reported by BPK in its annual audit report for 2006. This reflects the immense \nchallenges that lie ahead in an environment where accounting capacity at the grassroots level is \nweak and accounting processes are not yet integrated or fully automated. \n \nH.  External Audit \n \n50.  Indonesia has made considerable progress in addressing deficiencies in the audit sector \nin recent years.5 BPK was established under the Constitution and its roles and responsibilities \nare set out in Law No. 15/2004. Its organizational structure is outlined in the Decree of the \nSecretary General No. 34/2007 and No. 39/2007, and its governance arrangements are set out \nin Law 15/2006. BPK has a mandate to audit all government entities, including MDAs as well as \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs). Its independence from the executive branch is reflected in its \nboard members being appointed by Parliament. It recently received a significant increase in its \noperating budget to fund an increase in the number of auditors and administrative staff as well \nas the number of regional offices.6 All expenditures, revenues, and assets and liabilities of the \nGovernment are subject to its audit. However, since 2006, BPK has not been able to audit \nincome tax revenues because access to individual taxpayer records has been denied. This \nsituation has arisen from the requirements enacted in taxation laws (No. 6/1983 and 16/2000) \nunder which only the Minister of Finance can authorize access to individual taxpayer records on \na case-by-case basis. As a result, BPK has been unable to audit taxation revenues, which \nrepresent about 70% of central government revenues. \n \n51.  BPK  performs  financial,  performance,  and  special  purpose  audits.  The  audits  are \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  BPK  Auditing  Standards,  which  are  stipulated  in  BPK \nRegulation No. 1/2007 on state finance auditing standards. These standards are generally in \nline with international standards and have been applied since FY2006. \n \n52.  The  audit  report  on  the  financial  statements  is  submitted  to  the  legislature  within \n5 months after the end of the fiscal year. BPK also submits interim audit reports to Parliament \nevery 6 months on irregularities and inefficiencies it has identified at MDAs. \n \n53.  Auditees  generally  submit  formal  responses  on  audit  recommendations  and  their \nimplementation to BPK. The extent of follow-up is regularly monitored by BPK and reported in \nits interim audit reports. Records maintained at BPK indicate that an average of 80% of audited \nentities submit formal responses on follow-up of audit findings. However, this may not reflect the \nrelative importance of recommendations.  \n \n                                                 \n \n5  ADB. 2007. Sector Report on Accountability and Audit in Indonesia. Manila (Produced under ADB. 2004. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for the Implementation of the State Audit Reform Program. \nManila [TA-4473 INO]). \n6  The total annual budget for BPK has increased from Rp234 billion in 2004 to Rp1.5 trillion in 2008. The number of \nregional offices has increased from 7 (2004) to 29 (2008). \n ", "Appendix 8  69 \n54.  A peer review of BPK was completed in 2004, which revealed serious weaknesses in \ncapacity. Since then, improvements have been gradually made to the organization, with new \nhires and training. BPK has a follow-up peer review planned for FY2009.  \n \nI.  Internal Controls and Internal Audit \n \n55.  The Government\u2019s internal audit framework is extensive, but the institutional structure is \ncomplex and the mandates and division of labor between the various internal audit institutions \nhave not been clear. Government Regulation No. 60/2008 on government internal controls \nissued in August 2008 defines more clearly the roles and responsibilities of the different players.  \n \n56.  The Financial and Development Supervisory Board (government-wide internal auditor; \nBPKP)  is  now  entrusted  with  designing  the  guidelines  on  internal  control  implementation, \nproviding training, and improving the competence of the Government\u2019s internal auditors on \ngovernment internal controls\u2014essentially an advisory role. BPKP is also mandated to audit \ncross-sector activities, activities on request by the President, and the Government\u2019s treasury \nactivities if assigned by MOF.  \n \n57.  The inspector general is still the main internal audit apparatus of the line ministries. In \nprinciple, inspector generals have a mandate to audit all MDA activities and determine their \nannual audit plan independently; and all units within an MDA are required to provide data \nneeded by inspector generals. In practice, most audits by inspector generals check compliance \non  technical  and  operational  aspects  of  activities,  including  internal  control  procedures. \nEvaluations  to  determine  adequacies  of  internal  control  systems  are  rarely  carried  out.  A \nsystematic risk-based approach to internal audits is still in its infancy. Starting from 2006, \ninspector  generals  also  review  their  MDA\u2019s  annual  financial  statements,  to  ensure  their \naccuracy, reliability, and integrity, prior to their submission to DG Treasury in MOF. \n \n58.  There was no formal commitment control system at satker and MDA levels that records, \nreports, monitors, or controls spending commitments during the year against approved budgets \nand cash availability. However, MOF Regulation No. 171/PMK.05/2007 on accounting system \nfor line ministries now passes on the responsibility of commitment control to line ministries. \nDIPA documents prepared by MOF, which are detailed down to the spending unit or satker \nlevel,  establish  annual  budgeted  ceilings  on  expenditure  commitments.  These  procedures \ngenerally prevent MDAs from placing orders above the approved budgets (DIPA limits) for \nparticular spending items. \n \n59.  MOF  Regulation  No.  134/PMK.06/2005  and  DG  Treasury  Regulation  No.  PER-\n66/PB/2005 prescribe detailed procedures for payment of salary and nonsalary expenditures, \nwhich supplement other written procedures on accounting and recording transactions. However, \nthe processes are paper-intensive and involve inefficient use of staff resources. For example, \nthe supporting documentation required for payment of goods and services covers multiple \ndocuments that duplicate information, with weak audit trails and accounting evidence.7 \n \n60.  BPK\u2019s audit report for 2006 records numerous instances of noncompliance with rules for \nprocessing and recording transactions, such as noncompliance with procurement procedures, \npayments not supported by adequate documentation, and overpayments. Weaknesses in the \n                                                 \n \n7  In the Government\u2019s view, the procedures may create some duplication of work. However, this approach is taken to \nmaintain a check and balance mechanism and clarify roles, as mandated by Law No. 1/2004 on State Treasury.  \n ", "70   Appendix 8 \ncountry\u2019s internal audit function implies that the degree of noncompliance with rules is higher \nthan it appears.  \n \n61.  The  Regional  Supervision  Agency  (Bawasda)  is  the  internal  auditor  of  local \ngovernments. Lack of trained and skilled auditors, and methodology result in Bawasda the \nweakest component of the Government\u2019s internal control framework. The overall internal control \nenvironment continues to be weak. However, recent regulations on the accountability of line \nministries and internal control are positive developments.  \nJ.  Reforming Regional Public Financial Management \n \n62.  Decentralization  has  provided  local  governments  with  significant  resources  and \nauthority.  More  than  one-third  of  general  government  expenditures  are  now  executed  by \nsubnational government. This requires an adequate regulatory framework and PFM capacity at \nthe local level.  \n \n63.  After decentralization, the central Government passed comprehensive legislation for \nPFM  reforms  at  the  regional  level  to  mirror  the  changes  being  made  at  the  center.  The \nregulatory framework for regional PFM reforms is now largely in place, including mechanisms \nfor fiscal transfers to local governments. Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) regulations 13/2006 \nand 59/2007 and related MOF and Bappenas regulations now provide a clear framework for \nPFM reforms.  \n \n64.  As such, attention is increasingly being directed at ways to raise systems and human \ncapacity. Bappenas is taking the lead in trying to improve planning methods and skills at all \nlevels of government, and to link plans and policies more closely to budgets in within a medium-\nterm framework. Both MOF and MOHA are helping to disseminate the budgeting, reporting, and \nsupervision requirements of the new regulatory regime, particularly in relation to government \nregulations 58/2005 and 39/2007 and MOHA regulations 13/2006 and 59/2007, which provide \nthe framework for modern and consistent decentralized budget and financial management. In \n2007,  MOHA  conducted  specialized  PFM  courses  for  about  100  officials  of  the  central \nGovernment and 400 from regional governments. MOF is also training decentralized financial \nofficials nationwide, mainly through regional universities. In 2007, it conducted training in eight \ndifferent locations for 1,528 regional officials. A considerable expansion of the scope of training \nand professional development of regional finance officials is planned under subprogram 2, with \nsignificantly higher funding commitments from both MOHA and MOF than in recent times. \n \n65.  Subnational  governments  are  obliged  by  law  to  report  certain  fiscal  and  financial \ninformation to the central Government. Most local governments report the information required, \nbut  with  some  delay.  Accordingly,  it  is  now  possible  to  produce  consolidated  general \ngovernment reports, although with some delay. MOF and MOHA, with funding from the Local \nGovernment Finance and Governance Reform (LGFGR) 1 project loan, are also involved in \ndeveloping new computerized financial management information systems to support planning, \nbudgeting, budget execution, reporting, and auditing in 171 regional governments to begin with, \nand  possibly  other  regional  governments  later  on.8 About  9,642  finance  and  management \nofficials from regional governments will be trained in this major capacity development project. It \n                                                 \n \n8  ADB. 2005.

Manila (Program Loan 2192-INO for $300 million, and Project Loan 2193-INO [SF] \nfor $30 million). \n ", "Appendix 8  71 \nis expected that the timeliness and consolidation of reports will improve, with this system fully \nfunctioning in 2009. \n \n66.  Allocations  to  individual  subnational  government  units  are  formally  issued  with  the \npassing of the national budget in October before the financial year, but notional allocations are \nalso included in the budget presented to DPR in August. In practice, this leaves sufficient time \nfor  subnational  government  units  to  finalize  their  budgets  but  submissions  are  often  late \nbecause of local government constraints. However, budget allocations of shared revenues \n(nontax revenue) are not issued before March/April in the financial year. The notional allocations \nare significantly underestimated by the central Government, and disbursements from the center \nto the regions are back-loaded toward the end of the fiscal year. Both practices are deliberately \nchosen by the central Government to ensure fiscal discipline, but they constrain successful \nfinancial management at the local level. \n \n67.  Because  of  over-budgeting  of  expenditure  by  subnational  governments  and  under-\nbudgeting of transfers by the central Government, many subnational governments have built up \nreserves in recent years.  \n \nK.  State-Owned Enterprises \n \n68.  Indonesia has a sound legal framework for corporate governance and monitoring SOE \noperations. First, the SOE Law No. 19/2003 sets a clear ownership policy as the state is not \nallowed  to  be  involved  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  SOEs  and  must  allow  them  full \noperational autonomy. Second, a 2002 ministerial decree clearly details corporate governance \nresponsibilities, including the need to (i) submit each quarter the SOEs\u2019 financial statements to \nthe State Ministry for State-Owned Enterprises and to the appropriate line ministry; (ii) prepare \nannual financial statements that must be audited internally and by an independent auditor; and \n(iii) publish SOE annual reports in a timely manner.  \n \n69.  Existing laws and regulations governing SOEs are not implemented effectively. Long \ndelays still occur in auditing and publishing SOE financial statements. SOE annual reports are \nusually only regularly and systematically made public in cases where companies have accessed \nthe local capital markets with listed instruments. The Government included fiscal risk statements \nin the budgets for FY2008 and FY2009, and is working on further improving the quality hereof.  \n \n70.  The planned use of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) to accelerate investment will \ncreate fiscal risks that merit disclosure. The Government has taken steps to mitigate fiscal risks \nfrom PPPs. Presidential Regulation No. 67/2005 emphasizes careful project preparation and the \nselection of bidders in an open, competitive tender; and gives the minister of finance the right to \napprove or reject requests for government support. \n \nL.  Debt Management \n \n71.  During  the  previous  DPL  series,  two  major  initiatives  in  debt  management  were \nimplemented\u2014a clear debt management strategy, which was publicly announced; and a newly \ncreated  DG  for  Public  Debt  Management,  which  has  risk  management  oversight  for  both \ndomestic and external debts.  \n \n72.  The Government has also successfully reduced its debt\u2013GDP ratio to about 35% (2007), \nfrom  the  peak  of  over  90%  (1999).  Despite  the  positive  development  in  terms  of  debt \n ", "72   Appendix 8 \nsustainability and institutional reforms, the Government\u2019s institutional capacity to manage public \ndebts remains weak.  \n \n73.  Audit reports confirm that data and reports on domestic debt are reliable, but indicate \nthat data and reports on foreign debt differ from donor records and may not be accurate.  \n \nM.  Governance and Anticorruption \n \n74.  Indicators  of  corruption  in  Indonesia  are  improving,  albeit  slowly.9 Sufficient  and \ndedicated resources have been made available to most of the agencies critical to anticorruption \nefforts. Powerful independent oversight and prosecutorial institutions such as KPK and the Anti-\nCorruption Court have begun to deliver tangible results. In addition, institutions like BPK, the \nFinancial Transaction and Analysis Center, and the Attorney General\u2019s Office have all critically \nimproved their anticorruption track record. \n \n75.  High-profile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched,  leading  to  a  number  of \nsuccessful prosecutions. For example, in September 2008, seven parliament members were \nunder  investigation  or  prosecution  as  suspects  in  several  corruption  cases,  most  of  them \ninvolving bribery. Some members of parliament were arrested red-handed receiving bribes. A \nsenior prosecutor has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for receiving bribes. This case has \nled to the removal of three very senior prosecutors, including two deputies of the attorney \ngeneral.  \n \n76.  While  there  is  clearly  success  and  strong  momentum  related  to  investigating  and \nprosecuting  individual  corruption  cases,  there  has  been  less  progress  in  developing  and \nimplementing  a  coherent,  well-focused  strategy  for  corruption  prevention  within  the  state \nadministration.  Ministry  of  State  Apparatus  Reform  (MenPAN),  the  ministry  tasked  with \ncoordinating,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  implementation  of  such  a  strategy,  has  limited \ncapability in this regard. As a result, implementation of the existing anticorruption strategy for \nstate administration has been weak.  \n \n77.  While progress in developing and implementing a coherent, well-focused strategy for \ncorruption prevention in the state administration is limited, recent developments have been \npromising. Previously, KPK was in charge of pushing and monitoring bureaucracy reform as a \ncorruption prevention measure within several institutions such as MOF, Supreme Court, and \nBPK. However, when this task was handed over to MenPAN in 2007, progress became very \nslow. Nevertheless, individual government agencies including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \nMinistry of Trade, and most recently the Attorney General\u2019s Office) have initiated important \ninternal bureaucracy reforms, which are well under way. \n \nN.  Key Areas for Future Attention \n \n78.  In the period ahead, progress on the following key ongoing PFM reforms will need to be \nclosely monitored. \n \n(i)  Ensuring coherence and momentum in PFM reform.  \n                                                 \n \n9  For example, Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index for Indonesia was 2.2 in 2005, 2.4 in 2006, \nand 2.3 in 2007.   \n ", "Appendix 8  73 \n(ii)  Deepening the reforms of the central government budgetary sector, along the \nlines discussed above. \n(iii)  Ensuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds \nthrough continued implementation of a TSA, automating the treasury payments \nsystem, and the institution of measures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget \nbank accounts. \n(iv)  Strengthening internal audit institutions by establishing synergistic relationships \nbetween them and removing overlaps. \n(v)  Implementation  of  a  new  treasury  system,  extending  implementation  of \ngovernment  accounting  standards  and  reengineering  of  underlying  business \nprocesses at spending agencies to ensure reliable financial reporting. \n(vi)  Widening  reforms  throughout  the  Government\u2014.extending  modern  financial \naccountability  and  management  processes  to  subnational  governments  in  a \ncoordinated  manner  and  bringing  these  fully  in  line  with  emerging  national \nstandards.  \n \n79.  Many of these are being actively considered, and prioritized implementation plans are \nbeing developed by the Government. Implementation is well under way concerning the TSA and \nthe institutional framework for procurement.  \n \n80.  The capacity to monitor these and other reforms centrally has recently been established \nat the secretary general\u2019s office of MOF. Indonesians would benefit from a coherent reform plan \nor strategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination of PFM reforms. This would also allow for \nenhanced monitoring and accountability within the Government, and thus provide additional \nmomentum and direction to reform efforts. \n \nO.  Management of Foreign Exchange \n \n81.  The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The \ncountry is no longer subject to the extended arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia was \nlast subject to the transitional procedures under IMF\u2019s safeguards assessment policy in 2002. \nThat assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in the \naudit arrangements of Bank Indonesia. The main recommendations have been implemented, \nincluding the establishment of an independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia and the \npublication of Bank Indonesia\u2019s audited financial statements. Audited financial statements of \nBank Indonesia for 2007 have been reviewed and the audit report issued by BPK contained an \nunqualified audit opinion. \n \nP.  Conclusions \n \n82.  Indonesia has established a sound legal and administrative framework for modern PFM. \nChanges in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum \nhas shifted toward implementation of new PFM practices.  \n \n83.  Known  weaknesses  in  financial  management  and  accountability  continue  to  be \naddressed gradually through the PFM reform program discussed above. The development \npartners are actively engaged in this process. Key elements of the reforms are supported by the \nDPL triggers, as well as the Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration \nProject and initiatives supported by development partners. However, much remains to be done, \nand it will take time to realize the full impact of these reforms. \n \n ", "74   Appendix 8 \n84.  Meanwhile,  some  fiduciary  risks  will  arise  for  this  operation.  Although  the  pace  of \nimplementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the past year, the trajectory of \nreform  is  in  the  right  direction  and  the  current  Government  continues  to  demonstrate  a \ncommitment  to  continue  completion  of  the  planned  PFM  reforms.  Taking  these  into \nconsideration, the donor partners to the DPL/DPSP series do not propose putting in place any \nadditional fiduciary arrangements for this operation. \n ", "Appendix 8  75 \n \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry/Project Title: Indonesia: Fourth Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-4) \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Southeast Asia Department (SERD) \nPolicy-Based \nModality:  Division:  Indonesia Resident Mission (IRM) \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) has five basic strategies for poverty reduction: (i) broadening \nopportunities, (ii) empowering community institutions, (iii) increasing capacity, (iv) providing social protection, and \n(v) promoting global partnerships. The NPRS is to be implemented through macroeconomic strategy and policies \nfor  fulfilling  basic  rights,  promoting  gender  justice  and  equality,  and  regional  development.  It  considers \nmacroeconomic policies as the foundation for reducing poverty through a supportive business environment and \nbroad  opportunities  for  increasing  the  capability  of  the  poor  through  four  related  objectives:  (i)  create \nmacroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  promote  economic  growth,  (iii) increase  opportunities  for  employment  and \nentrepreneurship,  and  (iv)  reduce  inequalities  between  regions.  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term  national \ndevelopment plan (RPJM) includes the main tenets of the previous draft NPRS and incorporates the eight \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  This  provides  an  overarching  framework  that  places  human \ndevelopment and poverty reduction at the center of the development agenda. \n \nThe country poverty assessmenta and country poverty partnership agreementb consider macroeconomic stability \nas a fundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. Under the agreement, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas agreed to support the Government in promoting macroeconomic stability for inclusive growth and poverty \nreduction. The highest priority is given to institutional reforms to achieve transparent and accountable institutions. \nThe poverty agreement also calls for expanding and improving such key basic services as health, education, \nwater supply, and sanitation through public\u2013private partnerships; and points out the need to expand the system of \nsocial protection. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                      Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nThe DPSP-4 supports key areas of the RPJM and NPRS, including the investment climate, public financial \nmanagement and governance, and service delivery to the poor. The DPSP-4 triggers or policy actions under \nthese core areas are unlikely to harm the poor, while several triggers have the potential to reduce poverty in the \nmedium term.  \n \n2. Design Features. Not applicable \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country\nand major groups affected. \n \nThe majority of triggers under these core policy areas concern policy areas that do not directly affect the household \nbudgets of the poor. The links between poverty reduction and areas such as tax and customs reforms, regulatory \nreforms to improve the investment climate, nonbank financial sector deepening, and strengthening budgetplanning \nand execution, and transparency in financial management are indirect\u2014through increased economic growth and a \nmore efficient allocation of resources.  \n \nTwo triggers in the DPSP-4 policy matrix on tariff harmonization and improved access of finance for small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SME) are likely to affect the poor in a more direct manner. Firstly, changes in tariff \nrates can alter the purchasing power of poor households. Tariff reductions in goods that make up a significant \nshare of poor households\u2019 budgets will benefit the poor by increasing their purchasing power. To mitigate risks of \nadverse affects in low-income groups, the additional research capacity mandated by the trigger should enable \npolicymakers to use empirical estimates of the impact of tariff adjustments on poor households as an input into \nthe policy process. Secondly, improved SME access to finance is likely to have a direct multiplier impact on rural \nincomes, employment generation, and poverty reduction. A further set of triggers on strengthening effective and \npro-poor targeting of public programs, and community-driven development will have unambiguously beneficial \n ", "76  Appendix 9 \neffects on the poor. The first (pro-poor targeting) is about institutionalizing program assessments and linking the \nfindings with planning and budget allocation. It enables the development of good systems to target marginalized \ngroups, and empowers local governments and community and service providers to delivery quality services that \ngo toward addressing lagging human development indicators. Community-driven development projects, on the \nother hand, address in an integrated fashion the binding constraints to poverty reduction at the village level, \nthrough empowering the poor by giving them a say on how community resources are spent.  \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \nanalysis). \n \nThe policy reforms of the DPSP-4 do not adversely affect vulnerable groups. \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n \nThe trigger on tariff harmonization (trigger 5) has the potential to increase the purchasing power of poor \nhouseholds. The triggers relating to improving access to finance for SME (trigger 7) is likely to help generate rural \nemployment, income and pro-poor growth, and poverty reduction. Institutionalizing government systems for \nprogram evaluation and assessment\u2014and using the results in budget allocation, program design, and targeting \n(trigger 14)\u2014are likely to help develop better targeted anti-poverty programs. The trigger relating to issuing \nguidelines for pro-poor budgeting and planning for local government (trigger 15) is likely to address capacity \nconstraints at local government to deliver effective services. The adjustment of community block grants to \nmaximize employment and poverty impacts (trigger 16) will lead to more efficient and equitable utilization of scare \npublic resources and minimize wastage. Finally, the trigger on requiring teachers to teach for a minimum number \nof hours is likely to improve human capital, vital for future employment and income generation prospects. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe policy actions or triggers under the DPSP-4 are not likely to harm the poor and, if they affect them at all, they \nwill do more good. The main impacts, as mentioned above, are indirect.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe DPL series has supported actions that have been taken by the Government as part of its own reform agenda. \nThe development of this reform agenda has been done in close consultation with civil society. In particular, the \nGovernment undertook extensive consultation with key stakeholders on all five recently issued policy packages \nfor 2006, 2007, and 2008\u2014in infrastructure, investment climate, SME, and the financial sector. The Government \nhas engaged extensively with civil society on tax and investment law reforms. The entire set of DPL-5/DPSP-4 \npolicy actions, as in 2007, will likely be discussed with Parliament. The design and implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM) program involved substantial participation \nwith development partners and civil society, and community-based groups. Monitoring and evaluation of the \nPNPM and other pro-poor programs, and using the findings to help design and target future anti-poverty \nprograms, is a first in Indonesia.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n \n   Information sharing     Consultation     Collaborative decision making    Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes    No  \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including \nbudget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. The DPL/DPSP process supports the Government\u2019s C&P \nprocess. \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues. The DPL/DPSP series has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on making services work \nfor the poor. The improved poverty orientation of public spending increases women\u2019s access to essential services \nfor  achieving  MDG  targets,  including  reducing  child  and  maternal  mortality.  Improvement  of  the  financial \nmanagement systems of the Government, through increased transparency and accountability, will provide civil \n ", "Appendix  9  77 \nsociety with the basic information necessary to monitor government actions and enable it to provide inputs into \npolicy and budget decisions.  \n \nA strengthened civil society provides women with a more effective channel for voicing their priorities. An \nimproved investment climate is expected to provide greater opportunities for women, who experience significantly \nhigher rates of unemployment, even when controlling for experience and level of education. \n \n2.  Key Actions.
