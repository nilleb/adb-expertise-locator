THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has  adversely  affected  Maldives\u2019 \neconomic performance, due to the impact of global travel restrictions on the tourism sector, and \nthe population. Maldives was able to adequately deal with previous waves of the COVID-19 \npandemic due to the quality of its public health system and timely support of development partners. \nHowever, the country is still facing difficulties in responding to the rapid surge of COVID-19 cases, \nproviding treatment, and testing facilities in most of the dispersed islands, and delivering universal \nCOVID-19  vaccination  program  in  a  cost-effective  and  efficient  manner.  The  proposed \nResponsive  COVID-19  Vaccines  for  Recovery  (RECOVER)  Project  under  the  Asia  Pacific \nVaccine  Access  Facility  (APVAX)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  the \nGovernment of Maldives (the government) with timely financing to strengthen its vaccination \nsystem  and  support  its  long-term  national  COVID-19  vaccination  program.1 The  estimated \nfinancing amount is $10 million under the project investment component of the APVAX. The \nproposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation, readiness, and \nimplementation of the ensuing project.2  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Epidemiology of the COVID-19 in Maldives. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in \nMaldives was recorded on 7 March 2020 while the first local transmission was confirmed on 15 \nApril 2020. Since then, the country has experienced three waves of COVID-19. The first wave \nfrom April to June 2020, after a cluster of COVID-19 cases, emerged among the country's migrant \nworkers, and was successfully contained due to the government\u2019s quick and early actions. The \nsecond wave, from July to October 2020, recorded an increase in the number of new cases by \nfive times higher than the first wave, and was also successfully contained and mitigated due to \ntimely  support  of  development  partners,  including  ADB\u2019s  COVID-19  Emergency  Response \nprojects, countercyclical support facility loan, and regional TA projects.3 These interventions also \nscaled up the testing and treatment capacity of Maldives, which enabled better response to \nsubsequent small-scale outbreaks and effectively curbed the increase of confirmed cases until \nmid-January 2021.  \n \n3.  Devastating third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The third wave of the COVID-19 \npandemic, from 20 January to 6 July 2021, had devastating effects as the number of confirmed \ncases increased exponentially (from 14,712 on 20 January to 74,585 on 6 July 2021) and the \nnumber of deaths also increased at an unprecedented rate (from 49 on 20 January 2021 to 213 \non 6 July 2021). The third wave overwhelmed the health care system in Maldives and worsened \nthe existing crisis on the shortage in health care workers to efficiently meet the growing number \nof COVID-19 patients. The highly transmissible Delta variant has become the dominant variant in \n \n1  According to consultations with Ministry of Health, the indicative areas of support under the ensuing project include \nthe establishment of central and regional vaccine cold storage facilities, procurement of vaccine cold chain \nequipment, procurement of sea and land vehicles for vaccine delivery and vaccine safety management, trainings to \nimprove government officials\u2019 capacity to plan and implement the vaccination program, and the IT system for vaccine \nstock management. The tentative safeguards categorizations of the ensuing project are B for environment, C for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. The ensuing project is expected to be approved in Q3 2022.   \n2  Both the TA and the ensuing project are included in the Indicative Country Pipeline and Monitoring Report for \nMaldives, 2022\u20132024.  \n3  ADB. 2020.

Manila.   \n ", "2 \nMaldives since the third wave of the pandemic, likely causing the massive local transmission. As \nof 26 October 2021, Maldives had reported a 7-day average of 123 new cases per day, and a \ntotal of 86,324 cases and 237 deaths.  \n \n4.  Aligned with global strategies in COVID-19 response, Maldives launched a nationwide \nCOVID-19 vaccination program on 1 February 2021, as its exit strategy out of the pandemic and \nin expediting economic recovery. The vaccination program\u2014called \u201cCOVID-19 Dhifaau\u201d\u2014was \nrolled out following the prioritization criteria and management considerations in the National \nDeployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) for the COVID-19 vaccine. Under the program, free \nCOVID-19 vaccination of Maldives\u2019 residents, including foreign workers without official work \npermits, was provided. As of 24 October 2021, a total of 394,099 people (72.9% of the total \npopulation) has received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine; and among them, 354,759 \npeople (65.6% of the total population) have also received their second dose of the vaccine.4 \nHowever, the third wave of the pandemic in Maldives adversely affected the pace and coverage \nof the national vaccination program due to enhanced mobility restrictions to contain the virus.  \n \n5.  The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the vulnerabilities in the country\u2019s \nhealth system capacity that require an urgent need to improve managing emergency medical \nservices (EMS), strengthen coordination between health facilities, and improve the capacity to \nrespond to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Consultations with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and \nthe World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that the weaknesses to be addressed include (i) \ninefficient EMS for COVID-19 patients; (ii) unintegrated health information system (HIS) across \nhealth facilities, which is needed for effective COVID-19 patient information sharing during case \nreferrals; (iii) unavailability of tracking and identifying COVID-19 variants; (iv) inadequate mental \nhealth support for COVID-19 survivors and frontline health professionals involved in COVID-19 \nresponse;  and  (v)  lack  of  long-term  planning  for  the  COVID-19  pandemic  response  and \nvaccination system strengthening.  \n \n6.  Emergency medical services for COVID-19 and other health emergencies. Maldives \nhas a nationwide, state-operated EMS, which provides emergency medical care in pre-hospital \nsettings and during referrals for patients of any health emergency. The EMS also serves as the \nfirst point of contact for COVID-19 patients. The EMS is currently managed and coordinated by a \nnational call center operated by only four staff members. This is inadequate in handling the volume \nof  phone  calls  relating  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  other  emergency  medical  care \nrequirements. As delayed response to the emergency calls would severely affect pre-hospital \nservices to COVID-19 and other health emergency patients, it is crucial to digitalize the call center \nby developing an information technology (IT) system that will (i) automatically locate the patient \nand match them with the nearest ambulance, (ii) dispatch the paramedic team as and when \nneeded, and (iii) provide medical advice that can be taken until paramedics arrive.  \n \n7.  Health information system. The lack of an integrated HIS connecting all health facilities \nacross the country makes the sharing of medical records difficult and inefficient. Currently, \npatients must bring a hard copy of their medical records to the facility where they are being \nreferred to. The absence of an integrated and interconnected HIS has made it difficult for health \nworkers in atoll facilities to communicate with specialists in regional COVID-19 treatment facilities \nand tertiary hospitals for required treatments and patient transfers. The unclear understanding of \n \n4  Our World in Data. COVID-19 vaccinations status of Maldives.  Available at \n   https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-\nexplorer?zoomToSelection=true&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=People+vaccinated+%28by+dose\n%29&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Align+outbreaks=false&country=~MDV \n(accessed on 8 October 2021). \n ", "3 \nthe patient\u2019s medical history and previous diagnosis causes several challenges in the delivery of \na continuum of care including the management of COVID-19 patients. Due to the lack of \ncommunication  and  coordination,  health  workers  make  unnecessary referrals  of  COVID-19 \npatients, creating additional burden to the country's resource-constrained health care system.  \n \n8.  With support from WHO, a national integrated HIS is being developed in phases, which \nwill link different entities under the health sector. The integrated HIS will adopt a uniform data \nframework,  providing  for  interoperability  of  various  operational  information  systems  and \naggregation of primary data from operational and external systems. It will (i) allow timely sharing \nof information and improve the quality of patient care and evidence-based decision-making; (ii) \nmake the operation of health facilities more efficient, including the management of COVID-19 \npatients, thereby reducing costs; (iii) allow information-based management of key public health \nprograms and the National Health Insurance Scheme; (iv) help manage resources and services \nprovided by health facilities; (v) strengthen coordination between the MOH and atoll health \nfacilities; and (vi) enable better management of inventory and stock of medicines, medical \nequipment, and vaccines at the health facilities across the country. In addition, the MOH is \nplanning to expand the adoption of the hospital management information system  which is \ncurrently used in Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Mal\u00e9, to all atoll health facilities to enable the \ninformation sharing between all government health care facilities.   \n \n9.  Surveillance capacity for tracking COVID-19 variants. The COVID-19 virus is evolving \nwith genetic variations, and new variants may be more contagious or fatal. Conducting genomic \nsequencing will enable early identification of new variants, monitoring the spread of the virus, and \nbetter understanding of changes in the characteristics of the virus and its effects. A genomic \nsequencing facility is also crucial in designing an efficient health system response for future \npandemics. Maldives has adequate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing facilities; however, \nit lacks a genomic sequencing facility. Samples are sent to foreign laboratories, which is costly \nand time-consuming as results are delivered, on average, three months after sample collection. \nDeveloping Maldives\u2019 capacity to identify the variants in real-time is necessary  to improve \nmonitoring  of  cases,  as  well  as  the  prevention  of  deaths.  With  genomic  sequencing  and \nepidemiological investigation facilities, the country\u2019s disease surveillance system can detect \ntrends of variants circulating in Maldives and efficiently manage prevention and control efforts, as \nwell as for better response against other diseases such as cancer and anti-microbial resistance. \nWHO is currently working with the MOH on establishing genomic sequencing service in the \ncountry and identifying the required additional laboratory equipment, consumables, reagents, and \ntrainings to laboratory technicians for expanding the service capacity in the future.  \n \n10.  Mental health support to COVID-19 survivors and frontline health professionals. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the mental health situation of survivors, caregivers, \nand health professionals responding to the pandemic. It has triggered psychological distress, \nsleep  disorders,  anxiety,  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorders,  which  may  lead  to  suicidal \ntendencies and substance abuse. The government is aware of the importance of providing mental \nhealth services; however, it lacks trained mental health professionals in the outer islands. As a \nresponse, MOH plans to train health care workers in each atoll on community mental and \npsychological support to enable the provision of mental health services at primary health care \nlevel. \n  \n11.  Long-term COVID-19 response and vaccination planning. Maldives adequately dealt \nwith initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the quality of its public health system and \ntimely support of development partners. However, the country still faces difficulties in responding \nto the rapid surge of COVID-19 cases and providing required testing and treatment in the most \n ", "4 \ndispersed islands. It is imperative to have a comprehensive long-term pandemic response plan \nto strengthen the health system across the country to ensure a better response to COVID-19 and \nother health emergencies in the future. One of the main challenges that Maldives faces is the \nshortage in trained healthcare workers, which not only hinders the country\u2019s health system to \nefficiently meet the needs of the growing number of COVID-19 patients but also affects the pace \nand coverage of Maldives\u2019 national COVID-19 vaccination program. In addition, despite the high \nCOVID-19 vaccination rate, there are many unaddressed issues and challenges in vaccine \nstorage,  delivery,  deployment,  and  monitoring.  For  example,  COVID-19  vaccines  have \nsignificantly increased the load of the existing vaccine cold chain and logistics management \nsystem. The existing cold storage equipment and limited storage capacity of the central cold room \nmight not be able to handle larger batches of vaccines if they arrive at the same time, which may \ndelay the completion of the current COVID-19 vaccination program and in achieving sustained \nherd immunity. Strengthening the existing cold chain system through state-of-the-art modern cold \nchain facilities both at central and subnational levels is important in enhancing the overall routine \nimmunization program of the country. As COVID-19 is expected to become endemic globally, a \ncost-effective delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination program in the long run will be critical in \nensuring that the resource-limited health care system in Maldives will not be overwhelmed in the \nfuture. \n \n12.  To address these challenges, the ensuing RECOVER project under the APVAX will be \nproposed to strengthen the COVID-19 pandemic response and national vaccination program of \nMaldives. The TA will help in preparing the RECOVER project, particularly in the conduct of due \ndiligence and related technical assessments for improving the country\u2019s vaccination system. To \nsupplement the interventions under the ensuing project, the TA will also support capacity building \nand long-term planning for pandemic response and vaccination, including expanded coverage of \nCOVID-19 vaccination and introduction of new vaccines in the coming years.  \n \n13.  The TA aligns with the following impacts: (i) health outcomes in Maldives improved, and \n(ii) access to improved health services increased. The TA will contribute to the following outcomes: \n(i) Maldives\u2019 capacity to contain and mitigate outbreaks of COVID-19 and other communicable \ndiseases  strengthened,  and  (ii)  efficacy  and  timeliness  of  Maldives\u2019  COVID-19  pandemic \nresponse improved. The proposed TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority \n(OP) 1: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, and OP 7: regional cooperation \nand integration as it will provide timely needed technical support to address the ongoing COVID-\n19 pandemic and improve health outcomes in Maldives.  \n \nB.
