I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Golovnaya  240-Megawatt  (MW)  Hydropower  Plant \nRehabilitation Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will increase supply of renewable energy to national and regional \npower  systems.  The  project  will  refurbish  electric  and  mechanical  equipment  for  power \ngeneration and transmission at the Golovnaya hydropower plant in Tajikistan. This will increase \nthe availability of clean power for domestic sales and for export to Afghanistan. The project will \nincrease the generation capacity and operational efficiency of the power plant.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The total installed generation capacity of Tajikistan is 5,055 MW. Most (98%) of the \ncountry\u2019s generation is hydropower, which is impacted by hydrologic fluctuation, resulting in \nsummer surpluses and winter deficits. Tajikistan\u2019s power generation assets have outlived their \nuseful economic and technical life. Maintenance has been insufficient because of a lack of \nspare parts and funding at Barki Tojik, the vertically integrated state power utility. The power \nsector regional  master plan,  prepared  in  2012  under the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  program,3 found  that  nearly  80%  of  the  country\u2019s  generation  and \ntransmission assets needed to be replaced in order to meet demand and eliminate the winter \npower deficit. The master plan identified rehabilitation of Golovnaya hydropower plant as a \npriority  project.  The  country  partnership  strategy,  2010\u20132014  for  Tajikistan  identifies \nrehabilitation of existing hydropower plants as a key area of intervention.4 Reliable and secure \noperation of the large generation plant and high voltage transmission network is essential to the \nreliability of the interconnected regional grid, and a prerequisite for power trade with neighboring \ncountries. \n \n4.  Golovnaya hydropower plant is situated 80 kilometers south of Dushanbe. It has an \ninstalled  generation  capacity  of  240  MW,  making  it  the  fourth-largest  hydropower  plant  in \nTajikistan  after  the  Nurek  (3,000  MW),  Sangtuda  1  (670  MW)  and  Baipaza  (600  MW) \nhydropower plants. Construction of the Golovnaya hydropower plant began in 1956 and the last \nunit was commissioned in 1964. Since then, no major improvements or modernization has been \ncarried out to maintain the original performance in terms of efficiency, reliability and safety, or to \nreduce operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, except on one power generation unit. The \ncondition of the plant\u2019s main electro- and hydro-mechanical equipment is now very poor. In 1993 \nand 1994, unit 2 was partially flooded because of the failure of the hydraulic system to operate \nthe main spillway gate and six sediment sluice gates, which have flood discharge capability. If \nupstream hydropower plants must spill water in an emergency, Golovnaya hydropower plant \ncould be flooded. In addition, because of an original design deficiency, the power plant lacks oil \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is a follow-up to ADB. 2006. Project Preparatory Technical Assistance: Power Rehabilitation Phase II. \nManila (PPTA-4596). Due diligence and a feasibility study for the proposed project was prepared by the sector \noperational  performance  improvement  consultants  under  ADB.  2010.

", "2       \ncontainment facilities for the main transformers, which is standard emergency safety equipment.  \n \n5.  Over 2005\u20132012, Golovnaya hydropower plant generated an average of about 840 \ngigawatt-hours  (GWh)  per  annum;  average  annual  generation  has  decreased  since  2003 \nbecause of the increasing frequency of generation unit breakdowns. There are 52,560 available \nworking hours for the six units per year. In 2011 they operated for 24,720 hours, were under \nrepair and/or emergency shutdown for 27,135 hours, and were on standby for 705 hours. Unit 4 \nfailed and was rehabilitated in 2012.5 It is expected that the remaining units will fail in 5 years or \nless if major rehabilitation works are not undertaken urgently.  \n \n6.  The transformers and the 110/220 kilovolt (kV) switchyard of the Golovnaya hydropower \nplant play a vital role in the region, because: (i) they allow the production of hydropower plants \nto be evacuated to the transmission system\u2014this is the only switchyard that allows power to be \nevacuated from downstream hydropower plants at Perepadnaya (30 MW) and Centralnaya (15 \nMW); and (ii) they are used to connect the 220-kV and 110-kV networks, and supply power to \nabout one million people and 30% of Barki Tojik\u2019s industrial and commercial customers.  \n \n7.  The Golovnaya hydropower plant rehabilitation project is also important regionally. In \n1987,  the  first  power  transmission  interconnection  was  established  between  the  Geran \nsubstation in Tajikistan and Kunduz in Afghanistan. Until today, the Geran\u2013Kunduz 110-kV line \nis the only source of power for Kunduz. Tajikistan exports power through this line throughout the \nyear, with exports increasing by 30% on the average per year since 2008, reaching 106 GWh in \n2011. Golovnaya switchyard is the only source of power for Geran substation, and further \nexports to Kunduz. The demand in northern Afghanistan is expected to grow as the Government \nof Afghanistan intends to expand the distribution network in the region. A new 220-kV substation \nin Kunduz is under construction, which will be supplied by power from the newly constructed \n220 kV overhead transmission line from Tajikistan.6  However, due to compatibility issues, the \nnetwork in Kunduz will, in the interim, be split into two islanded grids; one supplied by the old \nGeran\u2013Kunduz 110-kV line and another by the new 220-kV line.  \n \n8.  The  financing  of  the  project  was  requested  by  the  Government  of  Tajikistan.  The \nproposed project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132014.7 The project is \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2013\u20132014 for Tajikistan,8 and in the medium-\nterm priority projects list of the CAREC Energy Sector Coordinating Committee.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be an increase in the supply of renewable energy to \nnational and regional power systems from 743 GWh in 2012 to 1,130 GWh in 2026. The project \noutcome will be an increased weighted average generation efficiency of the power plant, from of \n83% to 89%.  \n \n                                                \n5  The Islamic Development Bank, cofinancing ADB. 2010.

Outputs \n10.  The  project  output  will  be  a  rehabilitated  Golovnaya  hydropower  plant  and  its \nswitchyards, with generation capacity increased from 240 MW to 252 MW. The rehabilitation of \nthe hydropower plant envisages full replacement of units 1, 2, and 5 and is expected to bring \nsubstantial improvements in power generation, including during the winter power deficit season. \nThe average annual generation is expected to be 1,130 GWh in 2021, based on hydrologic \naverages over the last two decades. The amount of electricity generated will increase because \nof more efficient turbines and generators. Currently, the old units have a maximum efficiency of \n83%, discharging 180 cubic meters of water per second per turbine. After the rehabilitation, the \nefficiency of the new units will increase to 92%, while discharging only 120 cubic meters of \nwater  per  second  per  turbine,  because  of  the  higher  efficiency  curve  of  the  new  turbine-\ngenerator.9 Replacement of the turbines and generators enables 9% percentage point increase \nin efficiency, while reducing water discharge by 33%. The rehabilitation will also include the \ninstallation of two new transformers with oil containment facilities to prevent oil spills in the case \nof an emergency. The project will also install new control system for all six units, replace the \nspillway  gate  and  sediment  sluices;  and  rehabilitate  electric  and  control  equipment  in \n110/220 kV switchyards.  \n \nD.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nto implementation arrangements, procurement, funds flow, safeguards, and the implementation \nschedule have been analyzed and incorporated in the project.  \n \n16.  Two turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts covering the \nentire project will be procured by Barki Tojik. Procurement will follow international competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures using standard bidding documents for plant design, supply, and install \ncontracts. The EPC contract for rehabilitation of generation units will use a two-stage bidding \nprocedure without prequalification due to the technical complexity typical for hydropower plant \nrehabilitation projects. The EPC contract for rehabilitation of switchyards will use a single-stage \ntwo-envelope bidding procedure without prequalification. The Ministry of Energy and Industry \nconsultants, funded under the Regional Power Transmission Project,12 will assist the PMU in \npreparing bidding documents and bid evaluation and also provide additional hands-on training \nto the PMU procurement staff. \n \n17.  Barki Tojik will employ a project implementation consultant firm. This consultant will \nprovide technical, financial, and administrative support to the PMU during the entire project \nimplementation period. ADB grant proceeds will cover the cost of the project implementation \nconsultants. The consultant recruitment will follow ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The quality- and cost-based selection method with a \nquality:cost ratio of 90:10 will be applied to the selection of project implementation consultants \ndue to technical complexity associated with hydropower plant rehabilitation projects. ADB's prior \napproval is needed for changing the selection method. Ministry of Energy and Industry (MOEI) \nconsultants will assist the PMU in the recruitment of consultants. \n \n18.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  management  has  approved  advance \ncontracting  for  consulting  services.  Advance  contracting  allows  the  government  to  start \nprocurement activities at its own risk, prior to the signing of the grant agreement, but does not \nallow signing a contract with a firm before the grant has become effective. ADB informed the \ngovernment  that  such advance  contracting  (including  advertising) must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), and informed the \ngovernment and Barki Tojik that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to \nfinance the proposed project. \n \n19.  The project will be implemented over a 77-month period from February 2014 to July \n2020. The implementation consultant will prepare a detailed implementation schedule during the \npreconstruction phase of the project and submit it to ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n21.  ADB and the Ministry of Energy and Industry conducted in-depth technical due diligence \non  the  investment  proposal  to  minimize  the  cost  overrun  risk  usually  associated  with \nhydropower plant rehabilitation projects. The inspection work included complete dismantling and \nrelated inspection of one of the units; testing of the spillway gate and stop log operations, \nsediment sluice operations, the canal siphon bypass operation, unit synchronization, and gantry \nand power house operations; and inspection of electric equipment and control of switchyards. \nThe technical due diligence also assessed the condition of the civil structures and dam stability. \nThe inspection found that the structures satisfy the operational requirements of the hydropower \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "6       \nplant and no significant deterioration or movement has occurred over the last 50 years. A \nstability assessment of the main water-related structures, the powerhouse, and the spillway \nconcluded that both sections meet dam safety requirements for sliding and the position of \nresultant  and  foundation  stresses  under  normal  and  flood  load  conditions.  Various  cost \nestimation methods were used to obtain up-to-date quotations for water-to-wire equipment, \nwhich comprise a major portion of the rehabilitation works. The project implementation schedule \nwas prepared taking into account the annual seasonality of water flows to minimize flood risk.  \n \n22.  ADB is satisfied with the quality of the cost estimates, cost structures, appropriateness of \nthe technology, and the execution plan. The \u201creadiness\u201d level is high and the proposed technical \nsolutions are assessed to be more cost-effective than the alternatives. Barki Tojik\u2019s operational \nand maintenance staff is familiar with the proposed design concepts. The technical proposals do \nnot represent a shift from existing practices. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  17.3%,  confirming  the  project\u2019s \neconomic viability. The project will extend the economic life of Golovnaya hydropower plant, \nincrease generation capacity, and enhance energy output. The project\u2019s cost streams (i.e., \ncapital investment and O&M), which reflect the costs of delivering the expected benefits (i.e., \npower consumption and export sales), were compared with the cost streams under a \u201cwithout-\nproject\u201d scenario based on 2013 constant prices for the project life of 50 years. The without-\nproject scenario assumes no significant rehabilitation takes place and the existing units fail to \noperate one by one during the next 30 years according to the expected life of each unit. The \nincremental benefits attributable to increased output are measured based on willingness to pay \nand export sales after taking into account technical losses and summer surplus. The sensitivity \nanalysis confirms the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability under adverse conditions, \nincluding increased capital and O&M costs, and reduced benefits. \n \n24.  The financial analysis confirms the financial viability of the project. The financial internal \nrate of return of 4.3% is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.2%. Based on the \nwith- and without-project comparison, the project cash flow, measured at 2013 constant prices \nfor the project life of 50 years, reflects the costs (capital investment and O&M) and revenues \n(domestic sales and exports of electricity) attributable to the project, taking into account system \nlosses and taxes, from the Barki Tojik perspective. The project remains financially viable under \nthe assumption that the end-user tariffs continue to increase at the current rate of 16% per \nannum in real term. The sensitivity analysis also confirms the project\u2019s financial sustainability \nunder adverse conditions.  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed \nwith the government and Barki Tojik. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  The  specific  policy \n ", "7 \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 11). \n \n26.  The recent financial performance of Barki Tojik has been weak and unstable, generating \nlosses for FY2007\u2013FY2009, profits for FY2010\u2013FY2011, and losses again in FY2012. Barki \nTojik\u2019s financial management capacity requires significant improvement. External auditing for \nFY2011  and  FY2012  based  on  international  audit  standards  indicate major  issues  with (i) \nvaluation  of  inventory,  (ii)  revaluation  of  assets,  (iii)  records  on  account  receivables  and \npayables, and (iv) data conciliation of revenues.13 Barki Tojik\u2019s accounting policies, procedures \nand financial reporting follow International Financial Reporting Standards, which is required \nunder  the  Law  of  Accounting  and  other  decrees  of  the  government.14 Each  of  the  30 \nsubordinate entities under the holding company prepares its own financial report, and these are \nconsolidated at the holding company level. Barki Tojik has an internal audit unit established at \nthe head office, but with limited independence. External independent auditors are engaged to \nundertake  auditing  based  on  international  auditing  standards  for  the  holding  company  in \ncompliance with the statutory requirements.15 \n \n27.  Substantial efforts are being made to strengthen the financial management capacity. In \n2011, the government has initiated a comprehensive program to restructure Barki Tojik. The \nsector operational performance improvement (SOPI) program is extensively supported by ADB \nto improve commercial operations and financial performance of the utility and strengthen its \ncapacity  to  service  debt  while  providing  high-quality  services. 16  It  includes  institutional \nstrengthening and reorganization of Barki Tojik using a phased approach (phase 1 involves \nsector assessment, phase 2 preparation of a detailed restructuring plan, and phase 3 the \nrestructuring itself). The program addresses governance, financial management, control and \naudit, legal and regulatory frameworks, management systems, and organizational structure. The \nprogram also addresses technical operations and planning to optimize the future investments \nand  allocate  sufficient  funds  for  system  maintenance.  On  11  June  2013,  the  government \napproved (i) the assessment report prepared under the SOPI program; (ii) the intervention plan \nprepared by the SOPI program consultant; and (iii) the new structure of Barki Tojik, with three \ndepartments  under  the  same  legal  entity  (generation,  transmission,  and  distribution).  New \nheads of the generation, transmission, and distribution departments were appointed on 28 \nAugust 2013. Preparation of the detailed restructuring plan is ongoing and is expected to be \ncompleted in December 2013. \n \n28.  Separately,  Barki  Tojik  is  in  the  process  of  recruiting  international  consultants  to \nrevaluate assets in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and assess \nissues related to account receivables and payables. The project is funded by the World Bank.17 \nAutomated accounting and billing system are being introduced, starting in major cities such as \nDushanbe and Khujand. Continued effort is needed to steadily increase the tariff level, improve \ntariff  collection  efficiency  through  the  adoption  of  computerized  accounting  and  reporting \nsystems, and modernize and rehabilitate productive assets through investment. It is expected \n                                                \n13  External audit of Barki Tojik by independent auditors has resulted in a disclaimer of opinion for FY 2010\u20132012.  \n14 Government\u2019s Decree 428 of 4 November 2002 for \u201cInternational Financial Reporting Standards\u201d; Government\u2019s \nDecree 231 of 2 May 2010 for \u201cAdditional Arrangements for Implementing International Financial Reporting \nStandards in the Republic of Tajikistan\u201d; and President\u2019s Decree 702 of 25 March 2011 for the \u201cLaw of Accounting.\u201d  \n15 President\u2019s Decree 626 for the \u201cLaw on Financial Management and Internal Control\u201d; and President\u2019s Decree 631 \nfor the \u201cLaw on Internal Audit.\u201d  \n16 ADB. 2010.

Poverty and Social \n29.  A reliable supply of electricity brings significant benefits to communities (especially those \nthat are poor), including enhanced incomes and livelihoods, improved health and education, \nbetter security, and a generally higher standard of living. In Tajikistan the winter months are \nparticularly difficult for those who lack a reliable supply of electricity, and cannot afford adequate \nalternatives. Women in particular will benefit from the project because of their household and \nfamily responsibilities, including gathering fuel for cooking, heating, and processing water; and \ncaring  for  children,  the  sick,  and  the  elderly.  Electricity  also  offers  women  many  more \nopportunities for home-based enterprise and income generation, and has positive impacts on \npublic facilities such as schools and health centers.  \n \n30.  However, because this project will refurbish electrical and mechanical equipment at the \nhydropower plant, which will then supply electricity to the entire grid, the benefits (although \nsubstantial) are generalized and indirect, and do not target particular communities. Similarly, \nthere will not be specific power-supply benefits for the area surrounding the Golovnaya plant, \nnor for particular social groups such as women or  the poor, beyond those that accrue to \nelectricity consumers in general. The technological nature of the project allows little scope for \nsocial components, and the project provides no opportunities for pro-poor initiatives.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  The  project  is  classified  as  Category  B  for  environmental  impacts.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) and environmental compliance audit report prepared by Barki \nTojik are in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Anticipated adverse \nenvironmental impacts of the project are related to temporary shortages of electricity supplies \ndue to replacement of generating units, solid waste utilization, and health and safety issues. \nAdequate  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  project  design  and  will  be \nimplemented through an environmental management plan. The IEE includes provisions for \nincreasing the safeguards capacity of the PMU. The environmental management plan stipulates \nthat an environmental management development program for Golovnaya hydropower plant staff \nwill be implemented through training workshops at the preconstruction and construction stages. \nA public consultation was conducted on 6 September 2013. The IEE and the environmental \ncompliance audit report were disclosed on the ADB website on 20 September 2013. A climate \nchange risk assessment will be conducted during pre-construction phase to identify operation \nand maintenance measures aimed at increasing the climate resilience of the hydropower plant. \n \n32.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts are not envisaged, because all activities will \nbe  confined  to  the  power  plant  premises;  therefore  a  category  C  classification  has  been \nassigned for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples safeguards. Because the \nfacility was commissioned in 1962 and has existed and been operational since then, a social \ncompliance audit for the existing facility was undertaken to determine if there are outstanding \nland acquisition and resettlement issues; the social compliance audit confirmed there are no \noutstanding or remaining issues. \n \n ", "9 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.

Restructuring will be further supported by the \nWorld Bank\u2019s program addressing the introduction of IFRS, \nasset valuation, receivables, and billing. These measures will \nresult in improved financial management, including allocation \nof maintenance funds. The direct payment and letter of \ncommitment methods will be used, with no imprest account.  \nOperation and maintenance   The project implementation consultants in conjunction with \nBarki Tojik staff will develop a plant operation and \nmaintenance plan that will be approved by Barki Tojik \nmanagement before commissioning of the first rehabilitated \nunit.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IFRS = international financial reporting standards, PMU = project management \nunit, SOPI = sector operational performance improvement. \na ADB. 2010.
