On 16 January 2001, the Board of Directors approved the Asian Development Bank's \n(ADB) policy on water1 following extensive consultations with stakeholders over several years. \nIn addition to promoting national water sector reforms, integrated water resources management, \nand better water services for the poor, the policy commits ADB to regional and subregional \ncooperation by assisting with water sector assessments and exchange of data, enhancing \nawareness and understanding of the water sector issues and needs of each country, and \nsupporting water partnerships in its developing member countries (DMCs).  \n \n2.  On 10 December 2001, the Board approved the establishment of the Cooperation Fund \nfor the Water Sector (the Fund).  The Fund is a multi-agency umbrella facility to promote \neffective water management policies and practices at the regional, subregional, and country \nlevels and thereby to catalyze the implementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in the Asia and Pacific \nregion.  The Fund will finance a coherent program of activities (the Program) designed to add \nvalue to the water projects carried out by ADB\u2019s regional departments. The activities will \nincrease synergy in ADB\u2019s water sector operations as a whole through better awareness, \nknowledge  management,  capacity  building  to  support  generic  sector  reforms,  pilot \ndemonstration, regional cooperation, monitoring, and coordination.   \n \n3.  In December 2001, the Government of the Netherlands made an initial contribution of \n$4 million to the Fund for the Program\u2019s activities in 2002, for which technical assistance \n(TA) 6031-REG  was  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board.2  The initial contribution of $4 million has \nalready been committed, and the approved  activities under TA 6031 cover all six approved \ncategories of the Program, including (i) promotion and public awareness; (ii) knowledge base \nand capacity building; (iii) pilot demonstrations; (iv) water partnerships; (v) regional events and \ninitiatives; and (vi) program coordination, monitoring, and evaluation.  \n \n4.  The  Government  of  the  Netherlands  made  a  second  contribution  to  the  Fund  in \nDecember 2002 in the amount of $4 million. ADB's Water Sector Committee has recommended \nthat two regional TAs be processed to utilize this second contribution for the Program\u2019s activities \nin 2003. The first regional TA will support the organization of the 3rd World Water Forum (WWF), \nto be held in Kyoto, Japan, on 16-23 March 2003. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.3 \nA second TA will be prepared to support other activities of the Program. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The Board paper establishing the Fund identified three areas of priority assistance in the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s water policy and the national water policies in the Asia and Pacific \nregion.  The first area is assistance to DMCs for water sector assessments and national water \naction  agendas,  designing  and  implementing  critical  water  sector  reforms;  and  for \ndemonstrating these reforms through pilot initiatives at the appropriate levels, involving national \nwater partnerships and river basin organizations to ensure broad stakeholder participation.  The \nsecond concerns revising ADB\u2019s business processes and strengthening its internal capacity to \ntarget  the  water  sector  more  holistically  in  its  operations,  with  greater  synergy  through \nknowledge  management  and  collaboration  with  development  partners.    The  third  is  to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.  Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2002.

", "2       \nstrengthen regional cooperation and awareness of important water issues, trends, and policies, \nand to catalyze a new generation of water sector investments that follow from effective water \nmanagement policies and sector reforms.  The formulation of the Program is driven by priority \nassistance needs identified on an annual basis in these three areas, and indicators are being \ndeveloped to monitor progress in each area.  \n \n6.  In strengthening regional cooperation among DMCs and ADB in the water sector, the \nProgram  takes  advantage  of  the  ongoing  preparations  for  the  WWF.  The  WWF  is  being \nconvened to raise awareness of the critical water issues of the looming water crisis in the \n21st century, and to mobilize actions and resources to address these issues. The 3rd WWF will \nfocus on specific actions being taken around the world to implement the vision and framework \nfor action prepared at the 2nd WWF in March 2000 in The Hague, the Netherlands, with specific \nand  increased  attention  to  water  and  poverty  as  a  key  element  to  attain  the  millennium \ndevelopment goals.  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s water sector operations are highly relevant to the themes of the WWF, and ADB \nhas already taken a leading role in organizing several thematic sessions in close collaboration \nwith its development partners, supported by TA 6001-REG.4 These themes include (i) water and \npoverty, (ii) water in cities, (iii) water in small island countries, (iv)  regional cooperation for \nshared water resources management, and (v) flood management. Preparatory activities in 2002 \nhave included regional consultations with DMC stakeholders and development partners for each \nof these themes. A Water Awareness Program was also developed to support the preparations \nin  each  of  the  thematic  areas  through  media  relations,  promotional  materials,  television \ndocumentaries,  and  an  exhibit  at  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  in \nJohannesburg.  \n \n8.  ADB has also undertaken to organize the Water Development Partners Panel at the \nWWF to facilitate dialogue among leaders of development financing institutions, including ADB, \nand WWF stakeholders on the subject of water and poverty reduction. ADB has also joined the \nWorld Panel on Water Infrastructure Financing, which will make its recommendations at the \nWWF. A ministerial conference will be held at the conclusion of the WWF on 22-23 March 2003, \nat which ADB has been invited to participate, as well as in a meeting of agriculture ministers to \nbe held on 21 March 2003. In preparation for the ministerial conference, ADB staff participated \nin preparatory meetings during 2002.  \n \n9.  From an operational perspective, it is desirable that the 3rd WWF facilitate specific water \nsector reforms, actions, and programs undertaken by DMCs, international organizations, and \nnongovernment  organizations  that  can  be  further  promoted  through  ADB\u2019s  water  sector \noperations. In this connection, several initiatives have already been identified and prepared for \nthe WWF in the thematic areas indicated in para. 7 as a result of the regional consultation \nworkshops held in 2002.   \n \n10.  The WWF is expected to attract more than 8,000 participants from around the world, and \nabout 150 ministers for the ministerial conference. ADB\u2019s preparatory activities for the WWF \nhave been undertaken in close collaboration with agencies concerned in Japan, including the \nSecretariat of the WWF and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MLIT), which \nwill  host  the  ministerial  conference.  Following  the  successful  completion  of  the  regional \nconsultation workshops in 2002, ADB has been requested by the WWF Secretariat to finance a \nsignificant number of participants from developing countries to attend the WWF in Kyoto, \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Regional Consultations for the 3rd World Water Forum. Manila. ", "  3\n \nespecially for the sessions organized with ADB support. The Government of the Netherlands \nhas been consulted on the use of the Fund for this purpose and has no objection to support \nparticipants in connection with ADB-organized sessions at WWF.  \n \n11.  Additional  TA  resources  are  therefore  required  from  the  Fund  to  support  the \nADB-organized  sessions  at  the  WWF,  including  the  participation  of  presenters,  DMC \nstakeholders, development partners, and resource persons (including ADB staff concerned); the \norganization of exhibits and publicity; and the initiation of follow-up activities to ensure that the \nmain lessons learned from the WWF can be applied in ADB-financed water sector operations in \nthe region.   \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n12.  The  TA  will  support  the  ADB-organized sessions at the WWF and the initiation of \nfollow-up activities to implement WWF lessons in ADB-financed water sector operations in the \nregion.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA comprises the following activities: \n \n14.  Travel Support for Selected DMC Participants.  About 150 participants from DMCs \nare expected to share their experiences in the various sessions on (i) water and poverty, \n(ii) water in cities, (iii) water in small island countries, (iv) regional cooperation for shared water \nresources management, and (v) flood management, as well as in the Water Development \nPartners Panel session. The participants to be supported will be selected based on their \ninvolvement in these themes, in which ADB has taken a leading role.    \n \n15.  Travel Support for Staff Invited as Speakers and Resource Persons.  A number of \nADB staff have been invited as speakers and resource persons in the various sessions and \ndialogues at the WWF. In addition to the ADB-organized sessions, these include (i) water and \ngovernance, led by the Global Water Partnership; (ii) integrated water resources management; \n(iii) flood management, in collaboration with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, \nMLIT, and the World Meteorological Organization; (iv) the dialogue for water and climate, led by \nthe Government of the Netherlands; and (v) the dialogue on water for food and environment, led \nby the International Water Management Institute. \n  \n16.  Exhibits and Publications. ADB\u2019s Water Awareness Program, which was launched in \n2002 under TA-6031, has produced publicity materials, videos, a web page, and publications to \ndisseminate ADB\u2019s water policy and key development messages in the water sector, and to \nincrease public awareness and stakeholder dialogue  on water  reform issues, including the \nthemes organized by ADB for the 3rd WWF. Printing and distribution for the WWF will be \narranged, an exhibit will be organized at the WWF, and journalists from DMCs will be invited to \ncover the ADB-organized and related sessions at the WWF.  \n ", "4       \n17.  Initiation  of  Follow-Up  Activities.  Follow-up  activities  will  be  initiated,  with  the \nassistance of consultants, to  ensure that the main lessons learned from the WWF can be \napplied in ADB-financed water sector operations in the region.5  \n \n18.  Administrative, Logistics, and Other Supporting Activities. These activities include \nadministrative, shipping, local support, reporting, and miscellaneous costs in connection with the \nWWF. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n19.  The total cost of the TA, estimated at $1.00 million, will be financed on a grant basis \nfrom the Cooperation Fund  for  the  Water  Sector, to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented by ADB.  The Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Social \nSectors  Division  (RSAN)  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department,  in \nassociation with concerned divisions in the regional departments, will be responsible for all TA \nactivities. The Water Sector Committee will serve as the TA team.  The lead water resources \nspecialist of RSAN will coordinate the team\u2019s activities.  \n \n21.  The water focal point in RSAN will serve as TA office. Approximately 9 person-months of \ninternational  and  12  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  needed  for  the \nimplementation of the activities of the TA by RSAN. The areas of expertise that may be required \nfor WWF follow-up activities include water policy and institutional development, water sector \ncapacity building, knowledge management and information systems, rural water supply and \nsanitation, integrated water resources management, flood management, water supply and utility \nmanagement, natural resources economics, social research and development, and related \ndisciplines. It is expected that approximately three international consultants will be required, one \neach  for  the  five  areas  mentioned  in  para.  15,  supported  by  approximately  five  domestic \nconsultants in the DMCs that express interest in follow-up activities as a result of the WWF. The \nconsultants will be recruited as individuals.6 ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nrecruitment of consultants.  Outline terms of reference are shown in Appendix 3.  Equipment \nand  materials  to  be  financed  by  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  or  ADB  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement or other procedures acceptable to ADB.7  \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 6 months, commencing in February 2003 \nand ending in August 2003.  A final report will be prepared in August 2003. The report will be \npublished in the ADB website.  \n \n                                                 \n5  Areas in which follow-up activities are expected include (i) the proposed Water for Asian Cities Program, for which \nthe President and the Executive Director of United Nations Habitat signed a letter of intent at the World Summit on \nSustainable Development in Johannesburg; (ii) the proposed Rural Water and Poverty Action Program, which was \nconceived  at  the  Regional  Consultation  Workshop  on  Water  and  Poverty  in  Dhaka  in  September  2002; \n(iii) subregional flood management initiatives of the Mekong River Commission; and other activities as needed and \ndeemed appropriate. \n6  The required expertise is diverse, with inputs required in different themes that are led by ADB staff in several \ndepartments and offices. \n7  Equipment may include computers, software, multimedia instruments, and equipment for demonstration projects.
