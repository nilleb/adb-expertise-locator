INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands  plans  to  strengthen  infrastructure  sector \ngovernance, build capacity, and improve financial and operational management of assets. The \nGovernment has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance \n(TA). A Fact-Finding Mission in June 2008 held discussions with the Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Management (MFEM), the Public Services Commission, the Office of the Prime \nMinister (OPM), and the Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC) on objectives and scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and cost of the proposed TA. This report reflects ADB\u2019s findings \nand  the  understandings  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  design,  costs,  and \nimplementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \n2.  The  Government  sought  ADB  support  for  capacity  development  for  improved \ninfrastructure services delivery in the sectors of transport and communications, water sanitation \nand solid waste management, government buildings, and energy. The TA was requested to \nsupport the following actions: (i) changing institutional arrangements and developing capacity \nwithin  a  comprehensive  infrastructure  governance framework  (IGF)  for  delivering effective, \nefficient, and sustainable infrastructure services; and (ii) policy development and implementation \nfor (a) cost recovery and tariff setting, including appropriate provision for community services \nobligations; (b) developing planning and investment criteria and processes for assessing and \nprioritizing  infrastructure  investment  proposals;  (c)  asset  management,  including  systems \ndevelopment, asset management planning, performance monitoring, and annual auditing; and \n(d) developing appropriate relationships and roles for public and private sectors while facilitating \nprivate sector participation in infrastructure services delivery. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Deteriorating and Poorly Managed Physical Infrastructure \n3.  While  the  Government  has  successfully  pursued  prudent  fiscal  policies  that  have \nenabled it to repay past loans and create loan reserves, it has done so at the expense of \ninfrastructure maintenance and investment. This has resulted in aging systems that do not \nprovide an appropriate level of service to meet current demand or support future private sector-\nled growth. Infrastructure, and particularly on Aitutaki and Rarotonga, is not adequate for the \nexpanding  tourism  and  associated  industries  upon  which  the  economy  depends.  The \nGovernment intends to upgrade public infrastructure countrywide under the ADB-financed 20-\nyear infrastructure master plan,2 and there is a concomitant need to ensure that both existing \nand new  services  are  efficiently  managed  and  maintained.  ADB  will  support  upgrading of \ninfrastructure and has approved a loan3 for the upgrading of the Avatiu Port. Further support is \nplanned for upgrading of infrastructure in the water and sanitation sectors. \n \n4.  A  number  of  infrastructure  development  plans  and  policy  prescriptions  have  been \ndeveloped over the past 20 years. Many have failed to achieve their expected impacts because \nof the absence of an agreed and effective IGF that delivers cooperative and coordinated action \namong the central and line ministries. In the past, there has been a degree of rivalry between \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 August 2008. \n2  ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance to  Cook  Islands  for  Strengthening  Disaster  Management  and Mitigation. \n(Component 2: Preventive Infrastructure Master Plan). Manila (TA4605-COO approved on 30 June for $600,000). \n3  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Cook \nIslands for the Avatiu Port Development Project. Manila (Loans 2472 and 2473-COO approved on 20 November \nfor $15.5 million). \n ", "2   \nindividual line departments, overlapping efforts, and some resistance to efforts by the central \nagencies to raise standards and to streamline project planning and implementation. \n \n5.  In response, the Government commenced a wide-ranging review of the IGF, which will \nbe supported by the TA. The Audit Office completed a review of the management functions, \noperational outputs, and systems of the Ministry of Works (MOW) in April 2008. It had far-\nreaching recommendations for reforming the MOW and infrastructure sector. In May 2008, the \ncabinet established (i) the National Sustainable Development Commission reporting directly to \nthe cabinet, and (ii) an infrastructure committee attached to the CIIC.4 The National Sustainable \nDevelopment  Commission  will  review all projects and align  them  with  the  priorities of  the \nNational Sustainable  Development  Plan.  Infrastructure  projects  will  then  be passed  to  the \ninfrastructure committee to approve allocations for works funded by the Government and by aid. \nIn November 2008, the MOW and the Office of the Minister for Outer Islands were merged to \nform the Ministry of Outer Islands and Infrastructure Planning (MOIP). \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Capacity Issues \n6.  The  dispersal  of  activities  among  different  government  agencies  has  resulted  in \nfragmented and overlapping decision making, ineffective monitoring, and dilution of capacity \nand specialization. These issues are raised in the National Sustainable Development Plan, the \nAudit  Office\u2019s  report  on  MOW,  and  the  so-called  Eggelton  report.5 The  consequences  of \nfragmentation  include  (i)  poor  cooperation  between  agencies  and  poor  compliance  with \nGovernment policies and procedures; (ii) excessive bureaucracy and misaligned objectives; (iii) \nuncoordinated and reactive work programs and planning; (iv) budgets with little relevance to \nneed  or  justification  for  expenditures;  (v)  an  absence  of  measurable  outcomes  linked  to \nprograms and budgets; (vi) poor management accountability and erosion of public confidence in \nagency capabilities; and (vii) no clear ownership of policies, and a lack of planning or regulation \nof standards at the national level. \n \n7.  While  the  essential  public  services are  assigned  to  Government-owned  enterprises \noperating under CIIC as the trustee for Crown assets, fragmentation remains for the municipal \nservices (roads, water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, and, to a lesser degree, \nregulatory  services  associated  with building  control  and electrical  wiring  and  installations). \nMoreover, there are differences in how these services are provided on the Outer Islands and on \nRarotonga. \n \n8.  Capacity gaps and outmoded attitudes are undermining infrastructure operations, cost \nrecovery, the quality of service delivery (which suffers from poor operational and maintenance \nefficiency and little or no investment planning and asset management), and environmental \nsustainability \u2013 vital to maintaining the contribution of tourism to the economy. Lacking are a \nsound commercial orientation and customer-oriented service. There are many current examples \nof  the  consequences,  including  extended  delays  in  adopting  and  enforcing  environmental \nregulations  and  in  enacting  a  commercial  approach  for  operating  the  waste  management \nfacilities (which has been official policy since 2001). \n \n                                                \n4  The Cook Islands Investment Corporation is a statutory organization established as a holding company for the \nGovernment\u2019s state-owned enterprises. \n5  The report of the infrastructure committee commissioned by the Government in December 2007 to review \narrangements for delivering infrastructure services, commonly referred to as the Eggelton report. \n ", "  3 \nC.  Policy Development and Implementation Issues \n9.  Cost  Recovery  and  Tariff  Setting. While people accept paying for electricity and \ntelecommunications, there is historical and cultural resistance to the charging of fees for water \nsupply,  sanitation, and  solid  waste disposal.  Projects for  improving these  services  involve \nsignificant capital and operating investments, the costs for which must be recovered either from \nusers or through tax revenue. In the latter case, users are not faced with the true costs and \nhave no incentive to conserve an increasingly scarce resource. \n \n10.  Service standards have not been established in some sectors, and users have little say \nas to the levels of service provided. There is little accountability for the present tariff levels and \ntariff setting. A tacit expectation exists that commercial enterprises delivering infrastructure \nservices will perform some noncommercial activities or community service obligations (CSOs), \nbut there are no mechanisms in place to separately identify and recognize these or to provide \ngovernment compensation on an agreed performance basis. \n \n11.  Infrastructure  Planning  and  Prioritization.  The  Government  lacks  a  consistent \nmethodology for prioritizing and programming infrastructure development projects. Prior TA has \ndeveloped methodologies that aim to take account of the Government\u2019s economic and social \ndevelopment objectives (footnote 2). These have now been agreed and institutionalized within \nthe Government planning agencies and national planning process so that harmonized methods \nand criteria are adopted by all the infrastructure subsector agencies and are also observed by \nmost of the Government\u2019s development partners. \n \n12.  Asset Management. Poor management and inadequate investment in maintenance and \nrehabilitation has resulted in aging and failing physical infrastructure both on the main island of \nRarotonga and on the Outer Islands. Infrastructure is failing to meet current demand or to \nsupport the Government\u2019s objective of private sector-led growth. There is an urgent need for \ninfrastructure asset management plans with a medium-term planning horizon. \n \n13.  Private  and  Public  Sector  Roles  and  Relationships.  Maximizing  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance of  infrastructure  will  result  in \nincreased efficiencies and improved and more sustainable levels of services. Services such as \nthe collection of household refuse, trenching for cables (for Te Aponga Uira, Rarotonga\u2019s power \nsupplier), and trenching for water mains on Rarotonga (MOW) have been outsourced with some \nsuccess, thus avoiding the need for Government investment in plant and equipment. \n \n14.  The Government intends to confine its role in infrastructure to (i) strategic planning and \npolicy, (ii) determining affordable service levels in consultation with the users of the service, (iii) \nestablishing  programs  for  infrastructure  maintenance  and  operations,  and  (iv)  providing \nappropriate levels of funding. The role of the private sector will be in contracted infrastructure \nconstruction, maintenance, service delivery, and outsourced professional services. This will \nrequire new skills and capacity development in both the public and private sectors, but the \ngreater need will be in the public sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The expected impact of the TA will be effective delivery of environmentally sustainable \ninfrastructure  and  infrastructure  services.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  an \n ", "4   \nestablished governance framework supporting infrastructure management and development. \nThis will be characterized by common processes for developing infrastructure investment plans, \neffective and efficient financial and operational management of assets, appropriate opportunities \nfor private sector participation, customer-oriented service delivery, and transparent accounting \nand recognition for CSOs. The TA will complement ADB's on-going support for improvements to \npublic infrastructure. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  Institutional Improvements and Reforms. Reorganization of the infrastructure sector \nwill consolidate resources and overcome fragmentation, assign clear accountabilities, eliminate \noverlap in roles, and establish a platform for private sector participation in physical works and \nservice delivery. The TA will assist the Government to combine the technical capabilities and \nstaff resources from MOW and the Office of the Minister of Island Administration into a single \nnew ministry focused on infrastructure planning, project development, and asset management. \nWater supply and sanitation on Rarotonga\u2014extending later to Aitutaki\u2014will be consolidated into \na stand-alone water board. TA for stakeholder consultation, change management, capacity \nbuilding, and institutional strengthening will be provided to the reformed agencies. \n \n17.  The TA will prepare plans for detailed change management and implementation of the \ngovernment  agency  reforms,  including  review  of  the  legal  framework  and  requirements, \ndevelopment of organizational structures, revisions to financial and operational management \ninformation  systems  and  key  staff  job  descriptions,  preparation  of  business  plans,  and \ndevelopment of performance monitoring and reporting procedures. \n \n18.  Planning and Investment for Infrastructure. The TA will provide two planning and \npolicy specialists in the transport and municipal infrastructure sectors to assist with building \ncentral planning and policy capacity in the OPM and with preparing detailed sector policy \nstatements for (i) roads, maritime, and aviation; (ii) energy; and (iii) water supply, sanitation, and \nsolid  waste  management.  The  Government\u2019s  CSOs  in  each  of  these  sectors  will  be \ntransparently identified and costed. The TA will review the roles of the infrastructure committee \nand national sustainable development committee in the context of the overall IGF, and it will \nrecommend measures to ensure transparency and efficiency. \n \n19.  Asset  Management.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  to  introduce  a  regulatory \nrequirement for asset management plans and annual auditing by the Audit Office that will be \nharmonized  to  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  affected  agencies.  The  plans  will  cover \ninfrastructure planning, maintenance, performance targets, levels and standards of service, and \npublic consultation. TA from asset management and organizational specialists will be provided \nto the Cook Islands Audit Office to develop a standard plan template, prepare guidelines for \nplan preparation, and identify minimum criteria, as well as to CIIC for improving corporate \ngovernance relating to its asset management functions. Assistance will be provided to the line \nministries  and  other  infrastructure  agencies  in  developing  asset  management  plans  for \nRarotonga and the Outer Islands. \n \n20.  Private Sector Development. The TA will also assist MOIP and other agencies to \ndevelop performance-based contracts for outsourcing professional services and for contracting \nin maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction activities from the private sector. Assistance will \nbe given to line ministries and infrastructure agencies for organizing and conducting focused \nworkshops to impart the new requirements to the private sector consultant and contractor \nindustries. \n ", "  5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total cost of the TA is $666,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial  Fund,  funded  by  Government  of  Japan,  in  the  amount  of  $600,000.  Government \ncounterpart support will be provided in the form of office accommodation and remuneration of \ncounterpart staff in the value of $66,000. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The MFEM will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented over a \nperiod  of  2  years  from  October  2009  until  September  2011,  with  intermittent  inputs  from \ninternational consultants and support from national consultants. The international consultants \nwill be based within the Government agencies that are presently the main subjects of the \nassistance, these being the OPM, Aid Management Division of MFEM, CIIC, and MOIP. They \nwill also work with the Government-owned commercial enterprises of the Cook Islands Ports \nAuthority, Cook Islands Airport Authority, Te Aponga Uira, and Aitutaki Power Supply. \n \n23.  International  consultant  inputs  (18  person-months)  will  be  required  in  the  areas  of \ninstitutional  management  (3  person-months),  asset  management  (2  person-months),  urban \nplanning and policy (3.5 person-months) transport planning and policy (3.5 person-months), \nlegal  specialist  (2  person-months),  and  legal  draftsperson  (4  person-months).  National \nconsultant inputs (6 person-months) will be required in the areas of stakeholder consultation \nand  social  analysis  (2  person-months)  and  policy  research  assistance  (4  person-months). \nTerms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  provided  in  Appendix  3.  An  international \nconsulting firm will be engaged by ADB to provide the services using quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.6  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe Government of the Cook Islands for Infrastructure Services Delivery Improvement, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2008.
