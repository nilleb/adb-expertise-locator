INTRODUCTION \n1.  Asia\u2019s urbanization is expected to increase from 59% in 2014 to 78% by 2050, and is \nlikely to be a major driver of global growth in the 21st century.1 More than half of the world\u2019s \nmegacities are situated in Asia, while small and medium-sized cities are growing at a faster rate \nthan larger ones. This unprecedented scale of urbanization entails more efficient and effective \nways of providing basic urban services, including drinking water supply. \n \n2.  Responding to Asia\u2019s rapid urbanization, Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)2 emphasizes the commitment to inclusive and sustainable urban development, among \nothers, through collaboration with other development institutions and the private sector. The \nregional capacity development technical assistance (TA) is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020 Action Plan3 by aiming to improve urban drinking water \nservices in South Asia through better coordination between public and private sector operations, \nwhich is critical for inclusive and sustainable growth. The TA is also in line with ADB\u2019s Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u20132020,4 which promotes working with corporate water utilities to improve \noperational  efficiencies  and  enhance  water  supply  services.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategies for Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka among South Asian \ncountries aim at increasing the operational efficiency of drinking water supply systems through \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and private sector investments.5 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Increased access to safe and reliable drinking water service plays a vital role in inclusive \nand  sustainable  urbanization,  and  has  consistently  been  the  focus  of  the  international \ndevelopment agenda. Although many cities in South Asia have implemented reforms to improve \nwater  sector  performance,  a  number  of  issues  remain  unresolved.  In  particular,  service \ncoverage in South Asia is lagging the global average of 89%,7 nonrevenue water (NRW) levels \nare more than 40%,8 water operators lack the knowledge and skills to operate water supply \nsystems  effectively;  and  water  resources  development  is  not  keeping  pace  with  demand \nprojections. The majority of water utilities barely cover operation and maintenance expenses, so \nthey depend on government subsidies for most capital expenditures. \n  \n4.  In the past, developing member countries focused mainly on improving supply-side \ninterventions to increase drinking water service coverage. More needs to be done to improve \nthe operational efficiencies of drinking water supply systems by reducing water losses, adapting \nto climate change imperatives, and strengthening water security, among others. \n                                                \n1  United Nations. 2014.

New York. \n8  ADB. 2010. The Issues and Challenges of Reducing Non-Revenue Water. Manila. \n ", "2 \n 5.  ADB has been promoting PPPs, design\u2013build\u2013operate contracts, and NRW reduction, \namong  others,  to  help  water  utilities  improve  operational  efficiencies  and  secure  financial \nsustainability. More efficiencies can be gained through affordable technologies and scaling up \nbest practices. Water utilities in South Asia need to be conversant with up-to-date operational \nknowledge and skills, relevant technologies, and best practices. Customer satisfaction and \noperational  efficiencies  can  be  enhanced  by  deploying  smart  drinking  water  management \ntechnology, which is based on a combination of information and communication technology, \nnetwork solutions, and smart devices. \n \n6.  To  introduce  and  implement  smart  drinking  water  management  in  South  Asia, \ninvestments are required to improve the operational efficiency of drinking water supply systems \nthrough partnerships with a broad range of institutions. The TA has been developed to enhance \noperational efficiency and secure the financial sustainability of water utilities in South Asian \ncountries based on smart drinking water management, among others, through partnership with \nadvanced water utilities from within and outside the region. In particular, the TA will provide \ndeveloping  member  countries  covered  by  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Department9 with  customized \nbusiness plans as well as training programs and study visits for water utility operators to bring \nabout  much-needed  transformational  changes  in  the  way  drinking  water  is  managed  and \nprovided. \n   \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be improved urban drinking water services in South Asia, aligned with \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020.10 The outcome will be enhanced capacity of water \nutilities in South Asia to raise their operational efficiency and financial sustainability. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will generate the following outputs: (i) operational efficiency improvement plans \ndeveloped, (ii) knowledge-building and skills-development programs on smart drinking water \nmanagement  and  technologies  implemented,  (iii)  financial  sustainability  improvement  plans \nprepared, and (iv) new drinking water PPP contract modalities introduced. \n \n9.  Output 1: Operational efficiency improvement plans developed. The TA will develop \noperational  plans  to  strengthen  efficiencies  of  water  utilities  in  the  selected  cities  by \n(i) identifying issues and requirements based on diagnostic assessment of the existing water \nsupply systems; (ii) assessing and evaluating current and future demand for drinking water \nsupply based on the development projections; (iii) introducing and suggesting new operational \ntechnologies; (iv) pilot testing the application of smart devices; (v) developing short-, medium-, \nand long-term implementation plans, including NRW reduction; and (vi) developing standard \noperating procedures, drinking water safety plans, customer-complaint management policy, and \na public information program of drinking water supply systems. \n \n \n                                                \n9  ADB\u2019s South Asia Department covers the following countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri \nLanka. \n10 ADB. 2011. Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "3 \n10.  Output 2: Knowledge-building and skills-development programs on smart drinking \nwater management and technologies implemented. The TA will support sharing knowledge \non up-to-date relevant technologies based on information and communication technology for \nimproving operational efficiencies by (i) developing staff development and training programs to \nenhance capabilities and performance of operational staff at all levels; (ii) implementing training \nand skills development programs for water utilities, including training of trainers, taking into \naccount recipients\u2019 job levels and functions within their organizational structure; (iii) holding an \ninternational  workshop  on  smart  drinking  water  management;  and  (iv)  developing  and \nconducting study visit programs to advanced water utilities in Asia. \n \n11.  Output 3: Financial sustainability improvement plans prepared. The TA will provide \nplans for effectively securing the financial sustainability of water utilities in the selected cities by \n(i) assessing and evaluating current and future demand for investment based on development \nprojections;  and  (ii)  developing  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  financial  plans  to  improve \nfinancial sustainability based on operational efficiency improvement plans. \n \n12.  Output 4: New drinking water PPP contract modalities introduced. The TA will \nsupport water utilities in the selected cities to cooperate with the private sector by (i) introducing \nvarious drinking water service contract modalities, including service contracts, management \ncontracts, lease contracts, build\u2013operate\u2013transfer and similar arrangements, concessions, and \njoint ventures; and (ii) developing and suggesting the most appropriate water service contract \nmodality for attracting private sector investments. \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented to achieve these outputs through (i) creating a partnership \nwith an advanced water utility that operates drinking water supply systems based on smart \ndrinking water management, and (ii) hiring experienced international and national consultants \nand resource persons. \n \n14.  The TA assumes the following risks: (i) lack of sufficient commitment to improve the \noperational  efficiency  of  drinking  water  supply  systems,  and  (ii)  frequent  staff  turnover \nundermining knowledge-building efforts. These risks will be mitigated by selecting water utilities \nthat demonstrate commitment for the reforms and objectives of the TA, and having continuous \npolicy dialogue. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,350,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V and TASF-other sources) and \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund11 and administered by ADB.12 K-water,13 as a technical and training partner, \nwill provide in-kind contributions for the training programs such as resource persons, venues, \nand facilities. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n \n                                                \n11 Approved by the Government of the Republic of Korea on 19 October 2015. \n12  Includes taxes and duties, if any, based on the principles that (i) the amount of taxes and duties financed by the \nADB does not represent an excessive share of the TA cost; (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed \nexpenditures; and (iii) the financing of taxes and duties is relevant to the TA success. The Republic of Korea e-Asia \nand Knowledge Partnership Fund does not finance staff consultants. On eligible and non-eligible expenditures \nunder the fund, see ADB. 2006. Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. Manila, para. 17.  \n13 K-water is a government-owned water utility company of the Republic of Korea. \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency, with South Asia Department\u2019s Urban Development \nand  Water  Division  (SAUW)  as  the  focal  point  for  administering  the  TA.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented in four cities over 48 months from January 2016 to December 2019. Those cities \nwith ongoing or upcoming water projects funded by ADB will be prioritized. The TA activities will \ncommence upon receipt of governments\u2019 confirmation of their participation. \n \n17.  Improving operational efficiency and securing the financial sustainability of water supply \nsystems require practical skills and knowledge that are present in well-performing water utilities. \nConsidering K-water\u2019s expertise and experience in operating drinking water supply systems14 \nand training water operators, it will be more efficient and effective to create a partnership \nagreement between K-water and ADB. K-water will implement output 1 and the training and \nskills development programs under output 2, with support from individual consultants. The \nprofile  of  K-water\u2019s  smart  drinking  water  management  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A. \nSupplementary Appendix B is the draft partnership agreement with cost estimates, for signing \nby ADB and K-water authorities following ADB approval of the TA. \n    \n18.  Aside from the partnership agreement with K-water, the TA will require about 60 person-\nmonth  inputs  of  individual  international  and  national  consultants  and  48  working  days  of \nresource persons\u2019 participation to (i) support K-water in conducting technical diagnostic works \nand preparing operational plans; (ii) carry out financial diagnostic works and prepare financial \nsustainability improvement plans; (iii) introduce and develop new drinking water PPP contract \nmodalities; and (iv) coordinate and conduct study visits and a workshop. ADB will engage \nindividual consultants and resource persons in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). National consultants will be recruited from \nthe countries of the selected cities. All consultants will work under the overall supervision of \nADB. The outline terms of reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  SAUW will coordinate and monitor TA activities to ensure the effective delivery of TA \noutputs. K-water and the consultants will submit regular monitoring reports to SAUW. The TA \nwill maximize the impact by encouraging the dissemination and integration of good practices \namong the participating water utilities and other water utilities in the region through trainings, \nworkshops, and close monitoring of the outputs. \n \n20.  Any  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). At the end of the TA, equipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to the \nselected water utilities. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n14 Since 1967, K-water has been developing and managing national water resources, including 17 multipurpose dams \nand 70 water supply systems, as well as conducting international training programs. K-water has also been \nproviding operation and management services based on a concessional contract to 22 cities facing operational \ndifficulties because of the high nonrevenue water level, poor operation skills, and severe financial loss. K-water has \nreduced about 21.5% of the nonrevenue water level in those cities through smart drinking water management. \n ", "5 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis, \nfor Promoting Smart Drinking Water Management in South Asian Cities, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is aligned with \nUrban drinking water services in South Asia improved.
