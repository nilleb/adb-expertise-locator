THE ENSUING PROJECT \n1.  The government of Georgia (the government) is investing substantial amounts in the \ninfrastructure needed to take advantage of its strategic location, with emphasis on the country\u2019s \nbackbone for transit trade comprised of the East\u2013West and North\u2013South transport corridors. \nThe East\u2013West Highway is being upgraded (approximately 480 kilometers [km]; 40% completed \nas of end 2017) with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Investment \nBank,  Japanese  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the World  Bank. The  North\u2013South \nCorridor is a lifeline for Georgian and Armenian economic activities as the only land access to the \nRussian Federation, with a two-way containerized tonnage of approximately 1.3 million tons in \n2015.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will (i) improve the Kvesheti\u2013Kobi road section on the strategically \nimportant North\u2013South Corridor, and (ii) strengthen the capacity of the Roads Department and \ntechnical universities on construction, operation, and maintenance of large bridges and tunnels. \nThe Kvesheti\u2013Kobi road section, which carries about 3,000\u20134,000 vehicles per day (70% of cars \nand 30% of trucks and buses; 2017), has very difficult geographical and winter maintenance \nconditions that result in its closure for extended periods during the winter. Further, modern trucks \ncannot pass simultaneously through the existing galleries on this section due to insufficient \nclearance. The traffic discontinuity is a major impediment to meeting the increasing transport \ndemand on the North\u2013South Corridor and harnessing the tourism potential of the region (Gudauri \nski resort, Kazbegi National Park, etc.). \n \n3.  The outcome of the project will be connectivity, access, and safety on the North\u2013South \nCorridor improved. The project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) economic growth and \nregional connectivity supported (Georgia 2020),2 and (ii) competitive corridors across the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) region established (CAREC Program).3 It is \nconsistent with the strategic objectives of ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy 2014\u20132018 and is \nincluded in the Country Operations Business Plan for Georgia, 2018\u20132020. \n \n4.  The project is expected to cost about $550 million. The government has approached the  \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to \nhelp finance the project. The government will provide counterpart funding of about $130 million \nequivalent to cover taxes and duties, land acquisition and resettlement costs, financing charges, \nand other miscellaneous costs. The Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure will be \nthe executing agency and its Roads Department will be the implementing agency. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n5.  The  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TRTA)  will  help  the  government  of \nGeorgia (the government) prepare the proposed ensuing project.4 The TRTA will ensure that the \nproject  will  be  prepared  to  acceptable  technical,  safeguards,  and  procurement  standards. \nThe ensuing project is expected to meet the \u201chigh readiness\u201d criteria before Board consideration. \n \n                                                \n1  Since January 2015, Armenian exports to the Russian Federation are exempted from any custom duties as it joined \nthe Eurasian Economic Union. The Russian Federation is Armenia\u2019s largest trade partner. \n2  Government of Georgia. 2014. Socio-economic Development Strategy of Georgia, \u201cGeorgia 2020\u201d. Tbilisi. \n3  ADB. 2014.

Due  diligence.  The  proposed  project  is  very  challenging  from  an  engineering  and \nconstruction perspective. It will include the longest tunnel in Georgia (about 9 km long) and a \nsignature arch bridge that will become a national landmark. Given the project\u2019s complexity and \nsafeguards impacts, adequate resources will be required to (i) improve and finalize the safeguard \ndocuments that are being prepared under savings of on-going ADB and World Bank projects, (ii) \nassist with ensuring procurement of the project\u2019s civil works and consulting services are carried \nout efficiently and effectively; (iii) prepare a climate risk assessment and management report, and \n(iv) assess possible options for tolling of the project road. In addition, the proposed TRTA will help \nenhance communication and engagement with project beneficiaries and affected people through \ntailored communication activities and media. \n \n7.  Procurement support. The Roads Department\u2019s portfolio of projects is rapidly increasing \nwith  a  number  of  large  and  complex  projects  that  are  being  prepared  simultaneously. \nThe proposed ensuing project include the procurement of three large contracts for civil works and \nconstruction  supervision  services,  with  a  cumulative  value  estimated  at  $470  million. \nTimely award of these contracts and commencement of construction will require the support of \nan international procurement expert who will based in Tbilisi and work closely with the Roads \nDepartment. \n \n8.  Capacity development. The implementation of the Roads Department\u2019s program on \nhighways improvement will lead to a dramatic increase of its assets, which is exemplified by the \n50 tunnels that will be added in the next five years to the existing 10 tunnels country-wide. \nA similar situation will exist with major bridges. Constructing, operating and maintaining these \nlarge bridges and tunnels require a skillset that may not exist in the country at the moment. \nThe proposed TRTA will assist the Roads Department in learning from specialized experts and \nother road agencies how they can effectively manage their expanding asset base of large bridges \nand tunnels. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n9.  Output 1: Due diligence on the proposed project carried out. This output will include \npreparing safeguards documentation for the environmental and social aspects of the project \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement 2009, and preparing a gender action plan \nfollowing ADB\u2019s guidelines for such plans. It will also include the preparation and implementation \nof a project communication strategy and action plan. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Procurement  support  provided.  This  output  will  include  assisting  the \ngovernment with advertising the contracts, preparing and managing pre-bid meetings and site \nvisits, receiving bids, evaluating bids, preparing bid evaluation reports for government and ADB \napproval, and finalizing contract documentation for award. \n \n11.  Output 3: Capacity of the Roads Department assessed. This output will include (i) the \npreparation of a training needs assessment for the Roads Department and selected technical \nuniversities, (ii) the preparation and delivery of a peer-learning study tour for selected staff from \nthe Roads Department, and (iii) a scoping of the capacity development component envisaged \nunder the proposed project.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $800,000 equivalent, of which $750,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other resources). The \n ", "3 \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of furnished office accommodation in the \nRoads Department\u2019s premises and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1. The government was informed that approval of the TRTA does not commit \nADB to finance the ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will administer the TRTA. The Transport and Communications Division of Central \nand  West  Asia  Department  will  select,  supervise  and  evaluate  the  consultants. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  August 2018\u2013December 2019 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure \nImplementing agency  Roads Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultant  International:  $580,000 \nselection  24 person-months \nNational: \n6 person-months \nResource persons  International:  $40,000 \n2 person-months \nAdvance contracting  Selection of key individual consultant positions will commence \nthrough advance contracting following PAI 2.04.
