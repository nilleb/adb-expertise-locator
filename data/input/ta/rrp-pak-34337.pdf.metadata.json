Environmental assessment of the policy matrix was undertaken \nAssessment  and is available as a supplementary appendix. \n \nRationale  Sindh\u2019s  social  indicators  have  remained  well  behind  its  economic \nperformance, with high levels of illiteracy, malnutrition and mortality. The \npoor social status has a major impact on its economy, environment, and \nwater resources; and are directly linked to the poverty and gender complex \nthat  needs  to  be  addressed.  Public  social  services\u2014education,  health, \nnutrition,  population  welfare,  and  water  and  sanitation\u2014are  run-down, \nprimarily due to  chronic problems in governance, capacity, and financing. \nThe  Social  Action  Program  (1992\u20132002)  had  mixed  results  due  to  the \nprevailing economic problems of the 1990s, the time it took to generate \ncommitment for social services, and the lack of focus on service delivery and \nrelated governance.    \n \nIn the past 3 years, a policy framework has been put in place comprising the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy and Program, the Local Government Ordinance, \nsector specific policies and program, and the Sindh Reform Program. The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  administrative  and  fiscal \ndevolution through the Decentralization Support Program, while the Access \nto Justice Program supports legal and judiciary reforms. The Sindh Reform \nProgram is addressing macro financial and administrative issues with the \nsupport  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Structural  Adjustment  Credit.  The  Sindh \nProvincial Government (SPG) is committed to poverty reduction, devolution, \nand social sector development toward the Millennium Development Goals, \nand has requested ADB to provide program support for devolved social \nservices  in  the  province.  Pakistan\u2019s  devolution  provides  a  window  of \nopportunities  to  undertake  reforms  in  the  social  services.  Initial \nimprovements have been noted and local bodies are eager to move ahead. \nHowever, they need both technical and financial support to do so. The Local \nGovernment Ordinance supports greater involvement of community-based \norganizations  (CBOs),  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  the \nprivate  sector.  These  have  become  important  forces  in  social  services \nexpansion,  and  the  transition  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  develop \npartnerships. The proposed approach\u2014flexible support to local governments \nto carry out their own agenda based on certain terms and conditions to \nensure accountability and maximize benefits for the poor\u2014reflects the major \nthrust that emerged from the participatory planning process undertaken.   ", "  iii \nObjectives and  The overall goal of the DSSP is to improve people\u2019s education and health, \nScope  thereby  helping  to  reduce  poverty  and  gender  imbalances.  The  broad \npurpose is to increase school enrolment, and coverage with health and clear \nwater and sanitation services. These objectives are to be primarily achieved \nby improving governance and financing of social services; that should result \nin increased  access to basic social services, in particular for women; and \nimproved quality, efficiency, affordability and sustainability of services.  \n \nThe  Program  has  5  principal  policy  outcomes,  namely,  to  (i)  further \nadministrative  devolution  of  social  services,  (ii)  improve  social  sector \nfinancing and flow of funds, (iii) promote participation, linkages, and public \naccountability, (iv) rationalize services and set minimum standards, and (v) \nencourage public-private partnership.  \n \nThe  DSSP  covers  all  16  districts  and  102  taluka/town  municipal \nadministrations (TMAs) of Sindh for a time slice of 3 years for the program \nloans and 4 years for the TA loan.  \n \nIn the education sector, SPG will expand support to school management \ncommittees of schools up to class 12 to improve and operate these schools; \nand  provide  additional  assistance  for  rehabilitating  schools,  constructing \nfacilities  for  functioning  but  shelterless  schools,  home  schools  for  girls, \ntextbooks, stipends for girls, and contracting local female teachers on merit.  \n \nIn the health, nutrition and population welfare sector, SPG will promote the \nbasic  package  of  health  services,  contract  female  staff,  support  the \nestablishment  of  health  board  and  patients  associations  to  improve  the \nmaintenance  and  operations  of  health  facilities,  and  introduce  financial \nreforms to improve the quality, affordability, and continuity of health services.  \n   \nIn the drinking water and sanitation sector, SPG will build the capacity of \nTMAs to conduct infrastructure and consumer surveys and develop master \nplans; develop interim policies for drinking water, sanitation, and solid waste \nmanagement;  and  improve  basic  water  and  sanitation  services  through \npartnership with communities.  \n \nSPG proposes five areas of policy actions focusing on good governance.   \n \nFirst,  as  per  Sindh\u2019s  Local  Governance  Ordinance,  SPG  plans  further \ndevolution  of  administrative  and  financial  powers  to  local  governments \n(LGs), including preparation of the annual development program, personnel \nmanagement, and financial authority. It also plans to strengthen delegation \nwithin  the  local  governments  and  adjust  the  roles  of  provincial  line \ndepartments toward providing policy, monitoring and technical support. \n \nSecond, SPG proposes to increase social sector financing above the normal \nsocial  sector  share  of  total  revenues;  use  a  needs-based,  transparent \nformula  for  distributing  conditional  grants  for  social  sector  development; \nimprove the flow of funds; and improve financial management.   \n ", "iv        \n  Third,  SPG  proposes  to  improve  participation  and  accountability  by \nencouraging participatory planning in LGs, implementing the Gender Reform \nAction Plan, improving public information, and adopting the mechanism of \nmanagement  agreements  between  the  provincial  government  and  LGs \nspelling out the terms and conditions for grant support to LGs to ensure that \nfunds are well used while maintaining flexibility in the use of funds. \n \nFourth,  SPG  proposes  pro-poor  rationalization  of  services  and  setting \nminimum standards, using the annual planning cycle and access to grants \nfor  LG  plans.  It  proposes  restrictions  on  new  construction,  selective \nrecruitment of female staff, a minimal set of interventions to be considered in \nall plans, support of CBOs, and proper planning and monitoring procedures. \nSPG line departments will lead studies on sector policy reforms.  \n \nFifth, SPG proposes financial and technical support for CBOs in operating \nand maintaining social services, particularly expanding support for school \nmanagement  committees  in  all  schools,  but  also  encouraging  similar \ndevelopments in the health and water and sanitation sectors. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  adjustment  and  other  costs  of  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms \naddressed by the program loans are estimated to be at least $255 million \nequivalent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  SPG  has  requested  two  program  loans  equivalent  to  $210  million  to \nsupported  the  proposed  program  as  indicated  in  the  development  policy \nletter. The first, second, and third tranches, equivalent to, respectively, $100 \nmillion, $70 million and $40 million, will be made available upon compliance \nwith tranche release conditions following loan effectiveness.     \n   \nProgram Loan  A program loan is proposed in an amount equivalent to Special Drawing \nAmounts and  Rights 69,843,000 (equivalent to $100 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nTerms  resources, with a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \ninterest of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements.  \n \nA  second  program  loan  is  proposed  in  an  amount  of  \u00a511,968,550,000  \n(equivalent to $110 million) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with a \nterm  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements.     \n \nProgram Period   The program period will be from 1 February 2004 to 1 February 2007.  \n \nExecuting  The Finance Department, SPG  \nAgency   \n ", "  v\nImplementation  A steering committee representing relevant provincial departments, LGs, and \nArrangements  civil society will be established. The program support unit (PSU) and 16 local \nsupport units (LSUs) financed under the program will assist with planning, \ncoordinating, and monitoring the policy reform and development activities.  \n \nProcurement,  The proceeds of the loan will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding \nDisbursement,  local taxes and duties) of eligible items produced in and procured from \nand Counterpart  ADB\u2019s member countries. The Government will use counterpart funds in \nFunds   accordance  with  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  support  the \ndevelopment and reform of devolved social services in Sindh and adjustment \ncosts associated with the Program, including increased costs of devolved \nadministration and rehabilitation of social services, and up-front financing of \nLGs and CBOs.    \n   \nThe Technical  SPG has also requested for a TA project to help (i) strengthen sector and \nAssistance Loan  program management and monitoring, (ii) build the capacity of LGs and \nCBOs in social sector governance and development, and (iii) support policy \nreforms.   \n   \nCost Estimates  The TA is estimated to cost $14.2 million equivalent, comprising $1.9 million \nand Financing  in foreign exchange and $12.3 million equivalent in local currency cost. ADB \nPlan  will finance the equivalent of $10 million, and the Government will finance \n$4.2 million equivalent of the TA cost.   \n   \nLoan Amount  The TA loan is proposed in an amount equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \nand Terms  6,984,000 (equivalent to $10 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \nwith a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; interest of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements.  \n   \nPeriod of  From 1 February 2004 to 1 February 2008  \nUtilization   \n   \nExecuting  The Finance Department, SPG  \nAgency    \n   \nImplementation  The TA will also be guided by the steering committee established for the \nArrangements  Program,  and  will  primarily  support  program  implementation,  capacity \nbuilding and reforms through the PSU, 16 LSUs, and 3 line departments.   \n   \nProcurement  All ADB-financed procurement for the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nunder the TA  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Contract  packages  valued  for  $500,000 \nequivalent or less will follow international shopping procedures, except for \nvehicles, which may be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB). \nMinor  packages  costing  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  may  be  procured \nthrough LCB or direct purchase.  \n   ", "vi        \nConsulting  The TA will provide a total of 36 person months of international and 1,926 of \nServices under  domestic consulting services according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nthe TA  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging \ndomestic  consultants.  The  international  consultant  will  be  a  governance \nspecialist. Domestic consultants include experts on finance and governance, \npoverty and gender, capacity building and training, community organization, \ncontracting  and  personnel  management,  engineering,  environment, \neconomics, sector reform, and monitoring and evaluation. The majority of the \nconsultants  will  be  district-based  and  recruited  through  firms.  The \nconsultants for the PSU and line departments will be recruited either as \nindividuals or through firms.   \n \nProgram Benefits  The  main  beneficiaries  of  the  DSSP  will  be  the  rural  and  urban  poor, \nand Beneficiaries  particularly women and girls. Special attention will be given to vulnerable \ngroups such as child laborers.  \n   \nRisks and  Sindh\u2019s political instability, and therefore sustained commitment to the reform \nSafeguards  agenda, is considered a major risk for the Program. This is to be mitigated \nby  generating  broad  public  support  and  institutionalizing  the  devolution \nreforms. The economic and financial risks are considered less prominent \ngiven Pakistan\u2019s overall international and economic performance in the past \nfew years, but depend on a benign external environment for debt servicing \nand investment. A third risk is the limited capacity of LGs. Major capacity-\nbuilding efforts that will benefit the social sector are underway, but specific \nsupport for capacity building in the devolved social sector is largely lacking. \nIn particular the capacity of CBOs, and among these the health boards, is of \nconcern. Lastly, the serious levels of poverty in rural areas and urban slums, \nin  combination  with  social  inequity,  pose  major  program  constraints.  A \nsustained effort will be needed beyond the program period to consolidate \nreforms.                \n \n \n ", "", "I.   THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) two proposed \nprogram loans, and (ii) a proposed technical assistance loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan \nfor the Sindh Devolved Social Services Program (DSSP). \n \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT    \n \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s economic growth of about 6% gross domestic product (GDP) before the \n1990s was largely based on external capital inflows, resulting in major structural imbalances in \npublic finance.1 In the 1990s, the country\u2019s rapid accumulation of debts resulted in serious fiscal \nconstraints and deterioration of social indicators despite efforts under the Social Action Program \n(SAP). Since 2000, however, the fiscal balance and other indicators of the economy have \nimproved dramatically. Because of macroeconomic stabilization, and economic and governance \nreforms pursued by the Government of Pakistan (Government) in the preceding 3 years, and \nsome  developments  after  11  September  2001  key  macroeconomic  fundamentals  during \nFY2003 were much better than at any other time in the past decade. Despite this strong growth2 \nand improvements in other key macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, fiscal deficits, \nexports, and reserve holdings, investment failed to pick up due partly to excess capacity in \nmany  industries  and  a  wait-and-see  attitude  of  investors  in  an  environment  of  political \nuncertainty. Fixed capital accumulation is expected to pick up once the excess capacity is \nexhausted and if economic recovery is sustained.3 Economic growth will depend on regional \nand political stability, a benign external environment for debt servicing and investment, and \nprogress in the reform and development agenda under the new political and administrative \nsetup after devolution.4   \n \n3.  While the Government is on a fast track toward economic recovery and debt reduction, \nits tax reforms are slow. The situation causes pressure on public sector funding to implement \nthe commitments made at the Pakistan Development Forum and threatens to undermine two \nmajor initiatives: (i) the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Program (PRSP), and (ii) the devolution \nprogram.  These  initiatives  are  expected  to  help  Pakistan  move  toward  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs); they also require major additional resources for pro-poor services, \nand administrative costs and up-front financing of local governments (LGs). Poverty reduction is \nthe key objective of the Government's economic policies.5 Under its poverty reduction strategy \nthe Government is committed to increasing poverty reducing public expenditure as a percentage \nof GDP, including in the education, health, drinking water supply, and sanitation sectors by \nabout 15% each year. Pro-poor expenditure incurred in FY2003 showed a sharp increase of \nnearly 30% compared with that in FY2002, but fell short of its target of PRs161 billion. As a \npercentage of the annual GDP, the pro-poor expenditure increased from about 2.2% in FY2002 \n                                                 \n1   Sherani, S. 2002. Escaping the Debt Trap. An Assessment of Pakistan\u2019s External Debt Sustainability. Manila: ADB.  \n2   The real GDP growth rate is officially estimated at 5.1% in FY2003, compared with 3.4% in FY2003. \n3   ADB. 2003. Pakistan Economic Update (July 2002\u2013June 2003). Manila.  \n4  On 18 June 2003, the Executive Board of International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the fifth review of \nPakistan's performance under a 3-year, SDR1.03 billion (about $1.47 billion) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility \narrangement, and approved the disbursement of an additional $123 million. After completion of the sixth review, the \nIMF resident office in Islamabad is hopeful that in its scheduled meeting in October, IMF will approve further \ndisbursement of $240 million. Pakistan would have thus drawn a total of $978 million or 65% of the Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility. This is Pakistan's best ever record of compliance in an IMF program.  \n5  The Poverty Reduction Cell and Planning Commission Policy Wing, Finance Division. 2001.  Interim Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad. ", "2    \nto 2.5% in FY2003. This large increase was mainly due to the sharp increase in the first half of \nthe year due to the base effect.  \n \n4.  The provinces are expected to contribute to financing these initiatives. Federal transfers \n(from the divisible pool of taxes and in the form of straight transfers) increased at an accelerated \nrate of  20% per annum between FY1999 and FY2003. However, this was not enough to \ncompensate for the increased provincial obligations to support LGs. Responsibilities for basic \nservices were devolved without the modalities for fiscal decentralization in place. The situation \nis particularly acute in Sindh, which has some of the worst social indicators and underspending \nin  the  social  sector,  a  serious  budget  deficit,  and  a  complex  political  situation.  General \nadministrative  and  social  services  spending  has  doubled  in  5  years.  Sindh\u2019s  budget  has \nincreased from PRs51.7 billion in FY1999 to PRs99.3 billion in FY2003, while its budget deficit \nhas increased from PRs9.9 billion to PRs18.6 billion over that period. Sindh is facing a debt \nstock of about PRs116 billion (about $2 billion) and debt servicing levels of PRs1.8 billion (about \n$300 million) per annum. To cope with the situation, the Sindh provincial government (SPG) has \nadopted a proactive strategy and retired about PRS 1.8 billion in expensive domestic debt in the \npast 2 years to create more fiscal space. However, this has also constrained social sector \nspending, particularly for devolved services, which is still only  $11 per capita for education, \nhealth and drinking water supply and sanitation.  \n \n5.  In FY2001, SPG embarked on the Sindh Reform Program, supported by the World \nBank\u2019s Sindh structural adjustment credit (SAC) to improve the overall governance and fiscal \nsituation. The program includes tax and civil service reforms, improved governance in the \nfinancial sector, and creating fiscal space for increased social sector spending.  Progress in \nachieving the objectives of the reform program was impressive in FY2001 and FY2002. Owing \nto  tighter  budgetary  controls,  exercise  of  greater  fiscal  prudence,  and  reprioritization  of \nexpenditures, the total spending of SPG grew at a slower pace of 16% per annum in FY2001 \nand FY2002 compared with 29% in FY1999 and FY2000. Revenues of the province from own \nsources, which contribute close to 16% of all provincial revenues, grew at 9% per annum during \nFY2000\u2013FY2002. Since FY2003, however, growth in provincial revenues has slowed down to \nless than 5%, while fiscal stress increased due to accelerated debt repayments, the cost of \ndevolution and the poverty reduction agenda, and the decision of the federal Government to \nenhance salaries of government employees.  \n \n6.  It comes as no surprise then that Sindh\u2019s annual development plan is actually financed \nout of savings that occur during the fiscal year and from foreign project assistance. Put in \nanother way, the entire annual development plan of SPG is a form of deficit financing, which is \nonly met by savings from the salary component or cutting down on nonsalary expenditures. \nBecause of these severe fiscal constraints, SPG is forced to resort to a number of tactics, \nincluding  delaying  releases  of  funds  and  cutting  down  on  nonsalary  and  development \ncomponents. At the same time, there is a huge gap between the functional obligations of LGs, \nincluding district governments (DGs) and taluka6/town municipal administrations (TMAs), and \nthe financial resources and tax bases within their control. The process of transferring property \ntaxes to TMAs has also been very slow, and TMAs have not been receiving their full share of \nproperty taxes on time. While a total of PRs10 billion has been deducted at source for utilities to \nclear all arrears up to December 2002, it left  TMAs without funds for water and sanitation \nservices.  \n \n                                                 \n6 Subdistrict.  \n ", "    3 \n7.  SPG  has  made  some  headway  in  improving  its  financial  management  and  fiscal \nposition. It adopted a medium-term budgetary framework under the Sindh Reform Program and \nan institutional mechanism under the Provincial Finance Commission  (PFC) for transparent, \nequitable distribution of funds. The restructuring problems have become more acute since the \nimplementation of the devolution plan, which entails delegation of fiscal powers, resources, and \nresponsibilities  to  the  LGs.  This  poses  two  kinds  of  risks  for  province-  level  financial \nmanagement.  First,  it  locks  in  financial  resources,  and  second,  it  involves  relinquishing \nbudgetary controls and thus exacerbates the cash-flow problems. Hence, the inclination is to \nretain financial control at province level, even for devolved services. \n \n8.  SPG has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for support of the Sindh Reform \nProgram, its poverty reduction strategy and the devolution process over the next 3 years. This is \nin line with ADB\u2019s Pakistan Country Strategy and Program, SPG specifically requested ADB \nlong term support for devolved social services. 7 The program framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n  III.  THE SECTOR \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance   \n \n1.  Poverty and Social Status \n \n9.  Sindh is the southern province of Pakistan. Half of its population of about 35 million live \nin urban areas, most of them in Karachi, the economic hub of Pakistan with a population of 12 \nmillion. The  average per capita income is about $450 per person per year. Poverty has \nincreased from 27% in 1999 to 37% in 2001. About one third of the urban population and two \nthirds of the rural population live on less than about $1 a day. Drought is common in Sindh, and \nparticularly affects the population dependent on nonirrigated lands. Only 17% of the land area \nhas sweet water. Rural poverty, unemployment, high fertility, and exploitation result in high \nrural-urban migration, with Karachi\u2019s population growing at the rate of about 6% per year and a \nslum population of about 3 million.  \n \n10.  Defining poverty as  overall human deprivation comprising limited opportunities, social \nexclusion, and vulnerability to exogenous shocks, an estimated 50% of the population lives \nbelow the poverty line. In addition to low income, poor households are characterized by low \nlevels of education, lack of safe water, and unmet needs for population welfare services. The \nSocial Policy and Development Center8 ranked districts according to 11 social and 16 economic \ndevelopment indicators. The Center identified Tharparkar, Thatta, Badin, Jacobabad, Ghotki, \nMirpur Khas, Sanghar and Shikarpur as the most deprived districts.  \n \n11.  Two thirds of  women and one third of people above 10 years of age in Sindh are \nilliterate. Half of school-age children are not in school for reasons of poverty and lack of proper \nschools and instruction. The situation is worse in rural areas.  Nearly 15,000 schools are \nshelterless, while nearly 4,000 are closed due to nonavailability of resources. Participation rates \nhave stagnated. Women face the additional burden of gender discrimination. Gross enrollment \nis 38% for girls and 61% for boys. Key social indicators are in Appendix 2  (sector analysis). \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006).

Married women have on average about 5 children, and maternal mortality is high. The \nmajority  of  women  have  anemia,  iodine  deficiency,  or  general  malnutrition.  About  5,000 \nmothers, including many young girls aged 15\u201319, die each year due to pregnancy-related \ncomplications. In rural areas, women face many difficulties in accessing health services. For \nexample, less than 40% of women deliver in health facilities. The population growth rate has \ngradually fallen, but is still high at 2.5%. Due to the population momentum, however, Sindh\u2019s \npopulation is expected to double in the next 30 years, and produce major strains on the \neconomy, the environment, and limited water resources.  \n \n13.  About 10% of infants die before 1 year of age.  Pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and \nperinatal diseases account for 70% of infant deaths. Only 50% of infants are fully immunized. \nFrequent illnesses, food shortages, and inadequate care cause half of the children below the \nage of 5 to be underweight. About 45% of rural households use heavily contaminated water \nfrom uncovered wells, rivers, and ponds; and 53% do not have private toilet facilities. In urban \nareas,  major  problems  are  the  chronic  shortage  of  drinking  water,  pipe  leakage  and \ncontaminated water, and low cost recovery. Urban slum dwellers live in very poor environmental \nconditions, lacking services in solid waste management and access to sewerage systems. \n \n  2.  Social Sector Development \n \n14.  SPG operates an extensive network of education, health, and drinking water supply \nservices. Centrally located services are often overused, while remote facilities are often run-\ndown or closed. Common problems among social services are (i) lack of funds for operation and \nmaintenance; (ii) poor quality of services due to poor staff performance; (iii) lack of access for \nwomen and girls due to a shortage of female staff, particularly in rural areas; (iv) prohibitive cost \nof services for the very poor; (v) weak management, supervision, and monitoring due to \ngovernance problems; and (vi) limited stakeholder involvement and public accountability.   \n \n15.  During the past decade, Sindh implemented SAP9 as an effort to uplift the social sector. \nThe SAP experience had mixed results.10 Primary and middle school enrollments could barely \nkeep up with population growth. Studies suggest run-down schools, costs, and opportunity costs \nin association with poverty and drought as the main causes. Immunization coverage, another \ncore indicator, also stagnated, perhaps due to management constraints created by the added \nburden of the polio eradication campaign. Child mortality was reduced, but this may in part be \nattributed to private sector development and secular trends. There was substantial progress in \nfamily planning services. In the water sector, the focus was on handing over schemes to \ncommunities, hence there was little improvement in access to safe drinking water.  \n \n16.  Overall, SAP helped increase political interest in the sector, focus on policies and \nprograms for basic services, and improve the annual planning and budgeting process. It also \ninitiated  support  for  school  management  committees  (SMCs)  and  village  development \nassociations (VDAs), and made improvements in governance and aid coordination. However, \nSAP  was  not  an  effective  instrument  to  engage districts  in  social  sector development  and  \n                                                 \n9  The SAP was supported by a consortium of external agencies including World Bank, ADB, European Commission, \nDepartment for International Development, and Netherlands Government.

The second phase of SAP \ncoincided with major economic and governance problems, which affected its performance. As \nsocial sector financing declined, aid agencies engaged in micromanagement. Reimbursements \nslowed down pending completion of the reconciliation process demanded by those agencies, \nand the sorting out of multiple audit queries created by the prevailing audit culture. Aid agency \nreimbursement was 9% of SAP expenditures compared with a commitment of 25%. In short, \nSAP mainly helped improve the macroenvironment for social development. The sector analysis \nis in Appendix 2.  The review of SAP is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n   3.  Governance Reforms \n \n17.  The lack of access to basic social services of adequate quality is considered a major \ncontributing factor to the alarming rise in poverty. The degradation of basic services owes itself \npartly to consistently low levels of investment in the social sector\u2014with per capita spending on \nsocial sectors in Sindh being the lowest among the four provinces11\u2014and partly on the social \nservices management infrastructure, which was highly centralized at the provincial level, out of \nstep with local requirements and, for the most part, noninclusive. Lack of appropriate planning \nprocesses and allocation of resources without evaluating needs and/or financial viability led to a \nlarge stock of schools, health units, and water supply schemes scattered across the province \nthat were abandoned for lack of funds, poor design, or because they were simply not required in \nthose areas. In addition, local communities felt no sense of ownership for programs and projects \ndesigned by international, federal or provincial designed entities. The LGs and local people had \nvirtually no say in the development of those sector activities, which were driven by a one-size-\nfits-all approach. There was little incentive for local service delivery and accountabilities to \nimprove; in fact, LGs strategically withdrew from provision of basic services in education and \nhealth. Where they were asked to take over provincial schemes, especially in the water sector, \nthe LGs failed to maintain them due lack of either finances or sense of ownership.  \n \n18.  In August 2001, following a year of local elections, the Government implemented the \ndevolution plan and, in one go, created three levels of LGs entailing political, financial, and \nadministrative  devolution.  In  Sindh,  it  created  16  DGs,  102  TMAs,  and  1,044  union \nadministrations (UAs) to function as autonomous local bodies with their own responsibilities, \nfinancial shares, and revenue sources.12 DGs were made responsible for schools, colleges, and \ndistrict health services, and TMAs for water supply and waste disposal, in coordination with \nUAs. The Local Government Ordinance (LGO) provides the basic political and administrative \nframework for the devolution. DGs are independent LGs, while TMAs and UAs have been \ndesignated as autonomous corporate bodies. These new responsibilities require changes in the \nprovincial structures for those services and entailed a process of transfer of human and financial \nresources from the province to LGs, as well as a series of amendments in relevant laws, rules, \nsystems, procedures, and processes. Given the complexity of the task, it is not surprising that \nthe transfer of powers is still continuing. The new mandates clearly posed many new challenges \nfor the newly created LGs, which were faced with heightened public expectations on the one \nhand and large capacity gaps to handle these responsibilities, on the other. The new structure \nhas shaken up administrative relationships, including placement of the local administration \nunder  an elected  council  headed  by  a nazim,13and  relative  autonomy  of  LGs  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  \n                                                 \n11\n Social Policy and Development Center. 2001.

Karachi. \n12  While population sizes vary widely, particularly between urban and rural areas, districts have a population of about \n2 million (except Karachi district), subdistricts about 200,000, and unions about 20,000.  \n13  An elected district head. \n ", "6    \nprovincial  government.  The  role  of  provincial  line  departments  (PLDs)  in  policy  making, \nregulation, standard setting, quality control, and monitoring is still not clear. As to be expected, \nthere are also tensions between provincial and local elected representatives, and between DGs \nand TMAs that need to be diffused. While this new setup will take time to strengthen and \nconsolidate, it also needs the means to mature and demonstrate its potential.  \n \n19.  Devolution is based on the premise that locally managed basic services will improve \nresponsiveness to local needs and facilitate improved delivery, as it provides a range of \nopportunities for enhancing political commitment and greater accountability to the public. During \nthe first 2 years after devolution, social sector performance showed signs of improvement, \nalthough with great variation among districts. Councilors report improvement in staff attendance, \nstaff report improved supplies, and several  nazims emphasize the importance of operations \nabove new civil works. There are the expected problems\u2014political transfer of staff, and non-\nmerit-based recruitment of staff and site selection for facilities. The DG budget barely covers the \nexpenses for the fixed obligations that were to operate the existing services transferred to them, \nso a general freeze on new construction is required. Salaries have not yet been transferred to \nthe district, so DGs have little control over provincial staff and staff transfers. Despite late \nreleases of funds and procedural constraints, however, use of available development funds has \nbeen satisfactory in most places. Much of capacity building has so far concentrated on the DGs, \nwhile TMAs and UAs have received little attention. Under the Decentralization Support Program \n(DSP) and other external assistance, efforts are under way to improve the capacity of LGs. \nSpecial efforts are made to improve financial management and the audit trail for tracking \nexpenditures. The Accountant General\u2019s office is preparing appropriation accounts for the DGs.  \nSteps  initiated  by  SPG  to  address  the  macro  and  microenvironment  issues  are  likely  to \ncontribute to the improvement of social sector infrastructure and are in the right direction. \nHowever, they are clearly not enough as the social and financial gaps are both wide and deep. \nSupplementary Appendix B summarizes Pakistan\u2019s devolution program.      \n   \n  4.  Sector Financing \n \n20.  Education, health, and drinking water and sanitation services collectively made up about \n28% of total provincial spending from FY1999 to FY2003. Between FY2000 and FY2002, \nexpenditure  for  education  and  health  increased,  respectively,  11%  and  9%  per  annum. \nHowever, the share of education and health in total provincial expenditures fell from 24% and \n7% in FY1999 to 20% and 6%, respectively, by FY2003. Nonsalary expenditures accounted for \na modest 9% of total spending on education and 26% on health, while development spending \non education and health was 8% in FY2003.  Spending on water and sanitation has been \nminimal due to payment of utility arrears. SPG now commits to maintaining education and \nhealth spending as a share of provincial revenue, at about 30%, and expects to register growths \nof 12% and 22%, respectively, for education and health in FY2003.  \n \n21.  Much of the increase in spending is due to federally decided salary increases. Spending \non the nonsalary components and on developmental activities in FY2003 was significantly \nbelow budgetary estimates. In addition, cash flow problems resulted in inadequate and delayed \nreleases of funds to the service sites, thereby undermining the proper use of funds to finance \noperations and development. Thus, financing constraints impacted much more seriously on the \nefficiency and effectiveness of service delivery than the overall spending gap would suggest. \nThere is a strong case for improving the effective and efficient use of available resources by \nincreasing  nonsalary  expenditures.  SPG  has  frozen  new  recruitment,  which  is,  however, \nmaintaining the gender imbalance in staffing pattern. SPG also wants to contain infrastructure. \nFurther improvement in financing is proposed by increasing the fiscal transfers to provincial \n ", "    7 \ngovernments  and  LGs,  improving  the  flow  of  funds  to  LGs,  giving  LG  functionaries \nadministrative and financial authorities, improving management capacity and procedures, and \ndeveloping partnership with local communities.  \n \n22.  The proposed  levels of funding for the education and health sectors are likely to be \nsustainable largely because the overall budget deficits will be much smaller eventually if there \ncontinues to be a sizable cushion provided by vacant sanctioned positions (which will be partly \nused up by pay rise) and there are timely inflows from other externally assisted programs and \nprojects. However, any substantial increase in allocations both in the provincial government and \nDG budgets, so as to move toward MDGs, will be contingent upon accelerated repayment of \nexpensive debt and increase in the share of the provinces to at least 40% under the new \nNational Finance Commission Award expected to be finalized before the close of FY2004. \n \n  5.  Education \n \n23.  The  National  Education  Sector  Reform  Program  2001  lays  out  education  policies, \nprograms, and investment requirements. The major goals are (i) universal primary enrollment \nfrom about 70% at present; (ii) increase in middle and secondary school enrollments from \nrespectively, 48% and 30% to 55% and 40%; (iii) and literacy from 50% to 60% by 2005.14 \nSindh is following this reform program, and is in the process of defining its own targets.  \n \n24.  As per the devolution plan, SPG handed over 43,035 schools (and about 200 colleges) \nto DGs, along with the budget to operate and improve services, but excluded salaries and direct \nsupport to SMCs to improve operation and maintenance of schools.15 About 3 million children \nare currently enrolled in primary school. This number needs to increase by 2 million in the next \n10 years, or 200,000 per year. Consequently, at least another 100,000 children per year should \nbe added to classes 6\u201312 to double current enrollment. Sector trends have started to reverse \nthe enrollment decline, with improvements in the quality of instruction and retention of children. \nSPG has provided textbooks and stipends, and improved primary school and teacher salary \nconditions with the support of SAC. In FY2003, however, only about half the targeted number of \nadditional children were enrolled in primary schools in Sindh. SPG plans to hire more female \nteachers for primary schools, hire them on contract basis, and make the contract school-specific \nto increase capacity and make schools more attractive for boys and girls.  \n \n25.  ADB  has  just  approved  a  Sindh  Decentralized  Elementary  Education  Project  for \nupgrading  1,200  primary  schools  to  elementary  schools.16 SPG  wants  to  further  increase \nsupport for classes 6\u201312, including SMCs, adding female teachers, stipends and textbooks. \nSPG is also keen to improve katchi17 classes, shelterless schools, and home schools for literacy \nof girls. The European Commission (EC) is proposing an education project for Sindh in 2005, \nwhere all the external agencies in the sector will work toward achieving the Sindh education \nprogram through a sectorwide approach or similar arrangement. The United States Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) is directly supporting teacher training and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) in 4 districts. Estimates indicate that, considering other aid agency \ncommitments, there is a minimal financing gap of PRs3 billion (about $50 million) per year for \nschools up to class 12.    \n           \n                                                 \n14  Ministry of Education, Education Sector Reforms Action Plan, 2001\u20132005. \n15  For FY2004, the plan is to lump all sector budgets and transfer these as a one-line item to districts.   \n16 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Decentralized Elementary Education Project (Sindh). Manila. \n17 Pre-grade class comparable to kindergarten or nursery. \n ", "8    \n  6.  Health, Nutrition, and Population Welfare \n \n26.  The National Health Policy 2001 and the National Population Policy 2002 describe the \noverall  policy  framework,  programs,  and  investment  requirements  in  the  sector.  SPG  is \npreparing a provincial health strategy with its own revised targets. The child mortality rate is \nexpected to drop from 115 to 80 per 1,000 live births over the period 2000-2015, and the \nmaternal mortality ratio from about 400 to 250 per 100,000 live births in the same period.  \n \n27.  As per the devolution plan, SPG handed over 1,280 of 1,324 health facilities to the 16 \nDGs, along with a budget to operate and improve these services, excluding salaries. A major \nproblem of basic health facilities is the lack of a minimal budget for operation and maintenance. \nSPG released about 40% of the provincial health budget to the districts to provide primary \nhealth care ranging from basic health units to district hospitals. The remainder is spent on 44 \nprovincial institutions and tertiary hospitals. A common view is that hospitals were neglected \nduring SAP. However, hospitals are generally in a better state than the basic health facilities \nthat lack staff, medicines, and maintenance and repairs. SPG is exploring the possibility of \nmaking  hospitals  and  teaching  institutions  autonomous  to  improve  their  performance  and \ncontain costs. There are no reliable estimates of the funding gap in the provincial and district \nhealth services. However, minimum international standards for per capita spending on health \nvary between $12 and $75 per year, so a current public spending level of $2 per capita per year \nis in any case very low. The bulk of health sector financing comes from out-of-pocket spending, \nabout $9 per person per year. Many poor households can\u2019t afford this, and resort to cheaper \nservices of poor quality offered by quacks and shops, and resulting in income erosion. Aside \nfrom private sector regulation, offering alternative, quality public services is important. Modest \nprogress has been made in contracting out services to NGOs. SPG plans to further encourage \npublic-private partnership (PPP) in the sector and establish health boards with representation \nfrom civil society for all health facilities.         \n \n28.  About 35% of the health budget is funded through various federal programs. These \ninclude the expanded program for immunization, the national program for family planning and \nprimary health care, the national population program, the nutrition program, and programs for \nthe control of tuberculosis, malaria, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Federal \nprograms  are  supported  by  ADB,  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID), \nGovernment of Japan, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, United Nations Population Fund, World \nBank, and other external agencies. The funding gap in these programs for Sindh is estimated at \nPRs1 billion (about $17 million) per year.18 While the delegation of these priority programs to \nDGs is important to strengthen devolution, funding and capacity are major constraints.        \n \n  7.  Water and Sanitation   \n \n29.  As per the devolution plan, the Public Health Engineering Department has been merged \nwith the Local Government Department and will continue to execute large-scale development \nand extend technical support to TMAs. In collaboration with UAs, the TMAs are responsible for \nbasic water, sanitation, drainage, garbage collection, and solid waste management. \n \n30.  SPG aims to increase rural access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation. It uses \ntwo standards: (i) coverage with piped water and drainage schemes (respectively 10% and 7%) \nand basic coverage including hand pumps and pit latrines (respectively, 55% and 47%). In total, \nrural areas have 1,056 schemes for water supply and 730 for drainage. About one third of water \n                                                 \n18  Ministry of Health. 2003. Progress on Agenda for Health Sector Reform.  Islamabad. \n ", "    9 \nsupply schemes have been transferred to VDAs, and about one quarter are not working for \nvarious reasons such as poor design, high utility charges, and lack of maintenance. SPG plans \nto update its rural drinking water supply policy. It is based on the uniform policy of promoting \ncommunity ownership and management of services, but needs to be adjusted according to the \ndevolved  setup.  Priorities  in  the  rural  areas  are  the  categorization  of  existing  schemes, \nconsumer demand studies, social mobilization to hand over schemes, a master plan for each \nTMA,  installation  of  non-mechanized  schemes  wherever  feasible,  and  rehabilitation  of \nnonfunctioning schemes after technical and financial feasibility studies. To build the capacity of \nTMAs and VDAs, SPG proposes strengthening the provincial training institutions. An investment \nof about PRs 68 billion (about $1.2 billion) is required for basic services over the next 10 years.    \n          \n31.  For urban areas, coverage with piped water and drainage schemes is, respectively, 79% \nand  82%.  Contamination  of  drinking  water  and  poor  environmental  sanitation  are  major \nproblems in urban areas. SPG proposes to improve water quality by repairing existing systems \nthrough separate projects pending major investments needed in the urban sector. SPG plans to \nupdate the policy on solid waste management, incorporating potential collaboration with the \nprivate sector. The urban sector is plagued by a major funding gap of billions of rupees, while \naid funding had not been tight in recent years.        \n \n   8.  Social Dimensions \n \n32.  Pakistan\u2019s progress in the social sector reflects the local political economy. This situation \nis probably more extreme in Sindh province, which has a major urban-rural political divide and a \nfeudal/tribal system largely intact in rural areas. Private services in rural areas are very few, \nunlike in the cities and towns, where there is a well-developed private sector. The private sector \nhas a strong spirit of entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and self-regulation, as is evident in the \nnumerous nonprofit organizations, self-sustaining schools and hospitals, and other services for \nthe poor. Without these, the social status in Sindh would have been much worse today. These \nurban services are mostly institutionalized, and are often operated by families and social \ngroups. In contrast, local initiatives in rural areas often depend on individual leadership for \nsurvival.  This  leadership  at  the  village  level  can,  however,  have  a  major  impact.  Due  to \ndifferences in local leadership, two economically comparable villages can greatly differ in social \nindicators, which may reflect on the status of women, community support mechanisms, and \nvillage hygiene. A common problem is that communities lack confidence and know-how to take \ncontrol of their social services. However, the transition process is well under way in many \ncommunities where SMCs are now managing and improving schools. In Khairpur district, health \nboards operate government health facilities. About one quarter of water schemes are operated \nthrough community-owned, self-regulated VDAs. To capture these developments, a favorable \ngovernance  and  financial  environment  is  necessary,  as  well  as  local,  hands-on  capacity \nbuilding. Indeed, given the political economy of Pakistan, the Government cannot be expected \nto operate social services effectively without strong community support. For a highly centralized \nGovernment focusing on its own processes of control and audit, this is a major challenge. \nDevolution provides the opportunity to take bold steps toward community owned social services.   \n \n33.  The traditional roles of men and women are deeply ingrained in Sindh\u2019s rural society. For \ntheir own security and the welfare of their children, women have internalized a submissive role \nsince  childhood.  Devolution  has  addressed  gender  issues  to  some  extent,  including  the \nreservation of one third of reserve seats for female councilors. In practice, however, women \nhave little voice except in positions of high authority. Many external agencies provide multiple \ntraining programs for women leaders, but mostly without adjusting structural impediments and \n ", "10    \nmobilizing public support. Major gender reforms are planned under the Gender Reform Action \nPlan (GRAP) supported by ADB and other agencies.  \n     \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n34.  Multiple Problems and Pervasive Poverty. Sindh\u2019s many problems combined with \npervasive  poverty  are  potentially  overwhelming  government  and  private  resources.  The \ntechnology for developing basic services in all sectors is more or less standard and available. \nThe policies and reform agendas for the education and health sectors are basically sound, while \nthose for the water and sanitation sector need to be developed. The social sectors are dissimilar \nin many respects but the major problems affecting them are comparable. While problems can\u2019t \nbe  linked  to  a  single  cause,  nor  addressed  in  an  isolated  manner,  governance,  and  the \nunderlying  political  economy are at the core of the problems. Social sector development, \nforemost,  requires  governance  reforms.  Poverty  reduction,  including  social  development, \nrequires  a  coordinated  governance  response  to  improve  social  sector  management  and \nfinancing under the overall umbrella of the PRSP, the Sindh Reform Program, and the LGO. \nThe sectors have improved following devolution, but further governance reforms are needed.   \n   \n35.  Slow Pace of Transfer of Powers. While it is clear that the responsibility for providing \nbasic services in health, education, and water and sanitation have been assigned to the LGs, \ncommensurate administrative authority has not yet been fully devolved. For example, public \nhealth  engineering  staff  has  been  posted  to  districts  rather  than  to  TMAs.  Roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  line  departments  and  LGs  lack  clarity.  Areas  such  as  recruitment, \nprocurement, and intergovernmental relations in terms of monitoring responsibilities are still all \nfairly fluid and there are still no systems for establishing linkages among the LGs themselves. \nAlso, personnel management is not yet devolved. The provincial government continues to \nexercise administrative powers over the transfers and postings of officers. This setup seriously \nhampers the ability of the LGs to rationalize and redeploy staff, enforce work discipline and hold \nstaff accountable for performance. Moreover, LGs lack financial control. Devolution of political \npower must be followed by a process of gradual fiscal decentralization, which can only be \nactualized after fiscal powers have been transferred to the LGs.  \n \n36.  Poorly Distributed Services and Shortage of Resources.  LGs need to rationalize \nservices. New infrastructure is not matched with a budget to run the services. This imbalance \nmay further increase unless services are rationally planned. Staff is poorly distributed across \nSindh due to harsh living conditions. In particular, attention should be given to lack of access to \nservices for the very poor, women and girls, and people living in remote hamlets. In the \neducation and health sectors, there is a major problem of shortage of female staff in rural areas. \nIn the health sector, there are also major imbalances among the various cadres. In the water \nand sanitation sector (WSS), there is lack of trained engineers at TMA level. Alternative \nstrategies  of  service  delivery  have  to  be  deployed  to  make  services  available  to  rural \npopulations, such as the recruitment of local women, provision of home schools for girls, and \nincentives and security arrangements. Social sector financing also needs improvement. SPG \nfinancing is not pro-poor and needs improvement in terms of allocation, flow of funds, financial \nmanagement, accountability, and transparency. The provinces in Pakistan have a very narrow \ntax base. As a result, they depend heavily on transfers from the federal Government. In the \ncase of Sindh, federal transfers account for 75% of the total resources available to SPG. \nBecause  these  transfers  are  either  irregular  or  incomplete,  they  cause SPG considerable \nproblems in cash flow management. Consequently, resource flows to the LGs\u2014whose own \nrevenue base is very limited and which in turn depend on provincial transfer\u2014are unpredictable, \nthereby preventing LGs from effectively planning and implementing development initiatives.  \n ", "    11 \n \n37.  Reluctance  of  Local  Governments  to  Involve  Communities.  The  Sindh  LGO \nenvisages and encourages partnerships between the LGs and civil society. However, the \nperformance of citizens community boards in Sindh is poor. Similarly, in the case of schools, \nwhere the forum of SMCs has been strengthened, and the VDAs in the water sector to whom \nschemes are handed over for management after completion, there is a clear tilt toward involving \nthe community in various modes of engagement (coproducers, oversight roles, etc.). However, \na more concerted attempt to achieve these partnerships is needed.  \n \n38.  Limited Managerial and Technical Capacity. A concerted, cohesive, organized yet \nmultipronged approach is needed to build the capacity of LGs to levels that will enable them to \ndeliver basic services. The Government has already initiated the DSP, aimed at strengthening \nthe LGs by developing their capacities in basic areas such as audit, accounts, budgeting, and \ncommunication. Major efforts are needed to improve the managerial and technical skills of staff \nworking in the social sector. The DSP will be working closely with the DSSP and the Access to \nJustice Program, and the 3 programs will complement each other. \n \n39.  One-Time Opportunity for Major Governance Reforms with Devolution. The social \nsector employs more than half of Sindh\u2019s civil servants. This is a one-time opportunity to reform \nthe social sector, which so far received limited support in the devolution process. The transition \nprovides an important opportunity to mobilize civil society, introduce participatory approaches, \npromote public-private partnership, and develop a new role for the PLDs.  \n \n40.  Political Will, Local Leaders, and Participation to Achieve MDGs. Vested interests \nare opposed to devolution and may cause political instability and lack of commitment. Priorities \nof politicians may be in conflict with those that service the public interest best. Coordination with \nthe DSP and other programs gives opportunities to educate and groom new leaders, and \ndevelop local institutions. The public needs to be informed about expectations from and the \nperformance of local leaders on such topics as public needs and rights, and the quality and \ndistribution of services. Community-based organizations (CBOs) can be made responsible for \nroutine services, as has been shown in the education sector. The proximity of beneficiaries \noffers a major opportunity to improve transparency, quality, and accountability of services on a \nsustainable basis. While this is a sensitive issue for LGs who have just assumed power, reforms \nmay be relatively easier now before the current system becomes entrenched. The private sector \nis growing rapidly in the urban sector. It is the leading provider in the health sector and will, in \nthe years ahead, operate about half the schools in Sindh. SPG has been exploring partnership \nand is keen to set up a fund to sponsor NGOs proposed by LGs to support CBOs and improve \nsocial services, e.g., through contracting out entire services or contracting in managers. At the \nsame time, the private sector also needs support to become more effective in quality of \nservices, possibly with the help of self-regulatory mechanisms.    \n \n41.  Sindh\u2019s social sector indicators show high levels of illiteracy, malnutrition, mortality and \npopulation growth, which have a major impact on Sindh\u2019s economy, environment, and water \nresources.  Public  social  services  are  run-down  due  to  chronic  problems  in  governance, \ncapacity, and financing. The current public sector is by and large an employment scheme, \nspending almost exclusively on salaries with hardly any budget to operationalize services. \nDevelopment spending has also declined to an all-time low. The Government is committed to \naddress the poverty trap and gender imbalance in a holistic manner including the development \nof  social  services.  It  is  evident  that  improving  of  efficiency,  equity,  effectiveness,  and \nsustainability in the social sector requires addressing the  serious problems in governance, \n ", "12    \nparticipation, and financing. Otherwise, it is unlikely that social indicators will move toward the \nMDGs.  \n  \n42.  The SPG is committed to reduce poverty through economic, social, legal and political \ndimensions of governance by forging partnerships with civil society including PPPs. SPG has \ndeveloped a comprehensive approach to uplift public and community services for the poor, \nbased on a medium-term framework to improve key MDG indicators. In 2003, SPG prepared the \nSindh PRSP. The Sindh Reform Program and the Sindh LGO provide the basic financial and \ngovernance framework for social sector development. Sector reform programs have also been \nformulated based on the National Education Sector Reform Program and the National Health \nPolicy. Uniform policies for the WSS will be adapted to the new role of TMAs in the devolved \nsetup.  \n \n43.  The Sindh PRSP proposes a three-pronged poverty reduction strategy focusing on (i) \nequitable delivery of social services to the poor, (ii) creation of employment opportunities for the \npoor, and (iii) provision of an institutional arrangement for skills transfer and extension of micro \ncredit  to  the  poor.  In  the  social  sector,  it  aims  to  improve  performance  through  better \ngovernance, stronger partnership with civil society, and need-based allocation of resources. \nSPG requested ADB to provide support for a DSSP. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program \n(2002\u20132006) fully endorses Sindh\u2019s focus on poverty reduction, with governance as the central \npillar. ADB\u2019s major thrusts are (i) good governance including decentralization and access to \njustice, (ii) pro-poor economic growth, and (iii) inclusive social development. The Program gives \nsubstantial emphasis on participation: citizen involvement, especially of women, and private \nsector development. It also renews emphasis on water resource management. \n \n44.  The Sindh Reform Program aims to address governance and fiscal reforms as the root \ncauses of poverty and deprivation. The World Bank\u2019s SAC supports  the provincial effort to \nimprove financing and administration, and to pursue civil service reforms. SPG has already \nundertaken a number of initiatives ranging from increasing the budget outlays on health and \neducation in recent years, embarking upon broad governance reforms, and support for general \ncapacity building for LGs. For example, the allocations for maintenance and rehabilitation in the \nWSS increased by 58% in FY2003 and by 21% in FY2004. The proposed DSSP\u2019s support for \nreform and financing builds on the SAC inputs.     \n \n45.  The Sindh LGO offers major opportunities for social sector reforms. The LGs give a level \nof political representation that is closer to and more dependent on public interests. However, \nthere are major challenges and risks. Local leaders have just taken control, have limited \nexposure to working with other stakeholders in the social sector, and may not be ready to share \npowers. LGs are ill equipped to undertake reforms, particularly in the social sector, and risk \nrepeating previous mistakes due to lack of technology transfer. Misuse of funds for projects \nselected not on the basis of merit is a real risk. To increase accountability, the LGO emphasizes \nstrengthening the role of the community, particularly through CBOs, and citizen oversight \narrangements. It also favors expanding social services through PPP and the private sector. This \nlinks well with the realities on the ground, where communities and the private sector (including \nNGOs) have been the driving forces in social services expansion. However, it does require a \nchange of mind-set. Devolution provides a unique opportunity to make this happen.    \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s  DSP  supports  these  macro  governance,  gender,  and  financial  management \nreforms. Several technical assistance grants (TA), including for fiscal decentralization and \ngender reform, provide timely and critical inputs to implement these reforms. ADB\u2019s Access to \nJustice Program supports major reforms in the judiciary system and rule of law. Two ADB \n ", "    13 \nprojects, the Decentralized Elementary Education Project and the Women\u2019s Health Project \nalready support the sector.19 ADB, DFID and World Bank also support vertical health programs. \nUSAID is planning to expand support for the education sector, particularly teacher training and \nexpansion of services through NGOs. The EC is also planning support for Sindh\u2019s education \nsector  starting  in  2005.  The  proposed  DSSP  will  provide  supportive  reforms  and  flexible \nfinancing to address the gaps in the social sector, complementary to other donor assistance. A \nsummary of the development coordination matrix is in Appendix 3.       \n \n47.  Based on lessons learned during SAP, and the changed relationship with LGs after \ndevolution, SPG wanted to follow an approach different from SAP. As reflected in its project \nperformance audit report, the first SAP demonstrated (i) the importance of broadening the social \nplatform, particularly involving beneficiaries and the private sector in service delivery; (ii) the \nimportance of clear authority and flexibility to make decisions at the local level, given the nature \nof services; (iii) the value of keeping systems simple; and (iv) the importance of addressing \ngovernance, fiscal, and financial management constraints. The SAP demonstrated that social \nsector development requires a long-term approach, focusing on basic governance and services \nwhile avoiding micromanagement. Social development requires a large number of autonomous \nLGs to undertake activities in widely scattered facilities and communities throughout Sindh. \nBased  on  extensive  consultations,  SPG  proposed  a  program  modality  to  provide  flexible \nfinancing to address the gaps in service delivery, and support reforms, capacity building, and \nmonitoring and evaluation. Flexible support is required as local needs and priorities, while within \na given scope, cannot be precisely identified and costed in advance. The DSSP links flexible \nsupport with overall improvement of governance and financing, especially targeting the poor and \nwomen. There will be need for capacity building involving all stakeholders in the social sectors.  \n \n48.  Extensive  stakeholder  consultation  supported  the  development  of  the  DSSP.  ADB \nprovided TA and staff consultants to assess the crosscutting and sector-specific issues in the \nsector and consult stakeholders through a national and three provincial workshops.20 Consulting \nof stakeholders during the Project Completion Review mission of the Second Social Action \nProgram (Sector) Project (SAPPII), jointly with the World Bank, also yielded important insights \ninto both progress and constraints after devolution. The importance of continuing this dialogue \nwith stakeholders during program implementation needs to be emphasized.      \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n49.  The overall goal of the DSSP is to improve people\u2019s education, health21 and access to \nwater and sanitation, and thus help reduce poverty and gender imbalances. The broad purpose \nis to increase school enrolment, and coverage with health and clear water and sanitation \nservices. These objectives are to be achieved by improving governance and financing of social \nservices, that should in turn result in increased access to basic social services, in particular for \nwomen, better quality of services, and improved efficiency, affordability, and sustainability of \nservices. The program framework is in Appendix 1, and overall sector targets are in Appendix 2. \n  \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 1999.

Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Devolved Social Services Project, Sindh \nProvince. Manila.  \n21  Including nutrition and reproductive health. \n ", "14    \n50.  The Program has five principal policy outcomes: (i) further devolve social services to \nLGs, (ii) improve social sector financing and flow of funds, (iii) promote participation, linkages, \nand  public  accountability,  (iv)  rationalize  services  and  set  minimum  standards,  and  (v) \nencourage public-private partnership. The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n51.  Program support will comprise a conditional block grant support to LGs to undertake \nsocial sector development according to local priorities within the defined program scope. This \nflexibility, combined with local planning, ensures that funding for programs and projects will not \noverlap. In education, the program covers all schools, ranging from katchi class to class 10, or \nclass 12 for a few higher secondary schools, but not colleges.22 In health, the scope ranges \nfrom community health workers to district hospitals. In WSS, within the authority of TMAs, it \nincludes surveys and mapping, rehabilitation of mechanized schemes that are considered \ntechnically and financially viable, small new schemes for basic drinking water supply, small-\nscale drainage, health education and promotion of sanitation, and solid waste management. \nThe Program also supports crosscutting activities such as women\u2019s development, advocacy, \nand leadership training. LGs will prepare annual sector plans to access funding. LGs will decide \non  the  priorities  but  the  plans  should  reflect  a  minimum  package  of  interventions  to  be \nundertaken from all available resources (including other external assistance) and adhere to \ncertain items that cannot be financed from program proceeds, or only on certain conditions.    \n \n52.  The DSSP will provide program support for province-wide devolved social services for 3 \nyears, and project support for a TA for strengthening social sector development for 4 years.  \n \n53.  The TA project supports (i) sector and program management and monitoring, (ii) LG \ncapacity building and partnership development, and (iii) sector specific policy reforms. Further \nTA through a separate TA for international consulting services is planned for 2004 (para. 105).   \n \n54.  The DSSP supports the Sindh PRSP, the Sindh Reform Program, and the Sindh LGO. \nThe Program will be specifically linked to the SAC, especially on fiscal restructuring and civil \nservices reforms, and will build on the SAC reforms in the social sector under the medium term \nfinancing framework of SPG. It will also be specifically linked to the DSP and the Access to \nJustice Program, especially on governance reforms, devolution of powers, and administrative \nand  financial  capacity  building  and  gender  mainstreaming  (GRAP).  The  Program  will  be \ncoordinated  with  and  supplementary  to  other  external  assistance.  The  development \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 3.     \n \n55.    The recently established LGs are to uplift the run-down social services, rationalize them \nand make them more sustainable. The LGs face major constraints: limited capacity, continuing \ncontrol exercised by the province, lack of clarity on the role of the districts and the line \ndepartments, lack of financial autonomy, lack of integration of federal programs, inability or \nunwillingness to enter into a regular partnership with communities, and political, economic and \nsocial  constraints.  Policy  reforms  are  needed  in  financing,  transfer  and  use  of  funds, \ngovernance procedures, and community participation and responsiveness. \n \n56.    Uplifting social services first of all requires action to improve the flow of funds to LGs, \nwhich have continued to be affected by fiscal constraints. Arrangements need to be put in place \nthat assure more consistent funding and timely release of funds to LGs. Second, planning and \nimplementation capacity needs to be strengthened to be able to use funds properly.   \n \n                                                 \n22 The Program also supports primary education grades 1\u20135 for activities not financed under SAC.   \n ", "    15 \n57.    As elected LGs receive delegated powers, they urgently need assistance to develop a \nmore  systematic  approach  in  operating  services  in  their  areas  of  jurisdiction.  There  is  a \nsubstantial risk that management will be ad hoc and focused on new facilities, neglecting the \noperation  of  existing  services.  Three  elements  are  needed.  First,  through  a  consultative \nprocess, the LG constituency should agree on a vision and set local priorities based on actual \nneeds. Second, the priorities need to be reflected in the financing and expenditure plans. Third, \nan important but sensitive area is to undertake consensus building with local stakeholders to \ndecide on the future of nonfunctioning schemes and take action accordingly. Similarly, a plan \nand process should be put in place to improve staff balance through adjustments in training, \npositions, postings, and retrenchment. These actions need to be preceded by documentation of \nfacilities  and  staff,  performance  and  needs  assessment,  and  consultation  of  potential \nbeneficiaries and local leaders. \n \n58.    Making services more sustainable requires further support and development of local \ninstitutions to develop greater local autonomy in operating services based on the principles of \npartnership. Communities have to take an active role in improving service delivery through local \ninstitutions. SMCs need to be further institutionalized to operate schools, and expanded to \ninclude secondary schools. VDAs or private sector arrangements need to be developed to \nmanage water schemes. SMCs and VDAs need capacity building to develop and implement \nplans, and communities need to understand their role in supporting the SMC and VDAs in \nproviding services. The health sector, by the nature of its business, is more complicated, but \nalso offer opportunities to establish and strengthen patient associations and health boards, and \ngradually make health services more autonomous, self-sufficient, and accountable, and thus \nraise standards of health service delivery and mobilize other sources of financing.    \n \n59.  Funding can be targeted to an area already supported by other sources to supplement \nexisting allocations, or it can be devoted to filling an investment gap, for example, by providing \ncritical infrastructure facilities missing in functional schools or by supporting the extension of the \nscope of the government\u2019s existing program for providing stipends to include girls enrolled in \nsecondary grades (9\u201310), thereby addressing the issue of gender disparity and improving \nretention rates among girls. A similar flexible approach will be used in the other sectors. DGs \nwill be allowed to balance funding between the education and health sectors, and TMAs within \nthe water and sanitation subsectors.   \n \n60.  For example, program funds can finance the provision of essential infrastructure lacking \nin primary and middle schools, e.g., additional classrooms, boundary walls, toilets, drinking \nwater supply, furniture, etc. This support will be available if DGs can inventory the existing \ninfrastructure in schools under their jurisdiction and identify for each school the basic facilities \nrequired. Infrastructural improvement that will be allowed should make the school operational, to \nensure that all new schools will be functioning. \n \n61.  Since program funding will be targeted to specific areas or items from a specific positive \nlist, a system of conditional grants will be set up tying availability of funds to the fulfillment of \ncertain conditions, with performance to be judged on the basis of outcomes (like a 6 percentage \npoint increase in participation and completion rates by gender) in the medium to long term, \noutputs (like enrollment levels consistent with the targeted participation rates in the short term), \nor performance with respect to process indicators (like share of education in total expenditure, \nspending on nonsalary items as a proportion of the expenditure on education, timely release \nand use of funds, and number of schools completed through provision of facilities). To ensure \nthat the funds provided are used for the expressed purposes, SPG will enter into contractual \nagreements that define the rules of engagement between the respective LGs and SPG. \n ", "16    \n62.  Since the DGs and TMAs will be the implementing agencies for the bulk of the proposed \nreforms  and  interventions,  the  program  design  proposes  a  strengthening  of  the  financial \nautonomy of the LGs to permit spending on the basis of local needs and priorities, leading to a \nmore efficient use of scarce resources. To this end, funding for the Program will need to flow \ndirectly to the LGs through Account IV. 23 LGs will agree with SPG on minimal benchmarks to \nensure that program funds do not induce a diversion of resources and just replace current or \nexpected levels of government expenditure on education and health. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n63.  The policy matrix is in Appendix 4 and the development policy letter is in Appendix 5. \nThe policy outcomes and related policy actions are summarized as follows. \n \n1.  Further Devolve Social Services to Local Governments \n64.  SPG will further devolve administrative and financial powers in the three sectors to DGs \nand TMAs, including development planning, transfers, and financial authority. DGs, in turn, will \nensure proper delegation of responsibilities and authorities of executive district officers to district \nofficers and additional district officers to improve day-to-day management of services.      \n \n65.  SPG will adjust and strengthen the role of the PLDs to focus on policy reforms, regulate \nthe sector, and monitor and evaluate sector performance; and will strengthen sector training \ninstitutions for capacity building and support of LGs.  \n \n2.  Improve Social Sector Financing and Flow of Funds  \n66.  SPG will ensure that resource allocation for education, health, and water and sanitation \nwill increase based on an agreed-upon benchmark of a 30% share of normal incremental \nspending. The flow of funds to LGs will be improved, in that 25% of nonsalary funds will be \nreleased within one month of the start of the fiscal year, followed by timely monthly releases.  \n \n67.  Social sector allocations will be increased with an additional amount at least equivalent \nto the Asian Development Fund (ADF) contribution. The additional funds will be provided as a \nconditional grant and distributed based on a formula to be approved by the PFC. Funds will be \ntransferred directly to LGs through Account IV. LGs will use the additional funds according to \nlocal priorities within certain defined parameters. The sector financing plan and targets are in \nAppendix 6.  \n \n68.  SPG will  establish simple guidelines, criteria, and procedures for the use of funds \ntransferred to LGs and CBOs. These will include an agreement on the scope of activities to be \nsupported, and procedures, for using funds (such as public announcement of available funds, \nannual accounts monitoring, approved annual plan and budget and possible matching grant). \nLGs  will  ensure  that  they  will  adopt  the  general  guidelines  and  procedures  for  financial \nmanagement prepared under the DSP for use in the social sector. SPG will establish a system \nfor verifying the registration and bookkeeping capacity of CBOs to determine this eligibility for \ntransfer of grant-in-aid, and to actively seek to improve their capacity to make them eligible for \nsupport.  \n \n                                                 \n23 Local government account. \n ", "    17 \n69.  LGs will (i) maintain accounts in the manner prescribed, monitor services, and produce \nreports on prescribed format and schedules; (ii)  install procedures to improve monitoring of \nperformance;  and  (iii)  establish  annual  social  sector  growth  targets,  monitor  compliance, \norganize quarterly public awareness activities, and ensure transparency through public posting \nof LG and CBO performances. SPG will establish a third-party validation system to track the use \nof funds and impact, and ensure additionality of funding.   \n \n  3.  Promote Participation, Linkages, and Public Accountability \n \n70.  SPG will raise political and public awareness of the ongoing process to strengthen the \ndevolved social sector in terms of the scope of the program reforms and other important aspects \nof strengthening.    \n \n71.  LGs will adopt a transparent participatory planning process for the annual planning and \nbudgeting cycle for social services. The LG will prepare sector-specific work plans for social \nservices, following the regular budgeting processes of getting approval from the budget and \ndevelopment committees and seeking approval from the respective councils. SPG will establish \na system for approving conditional grants to DGs and TMAs to allow additional funding for plans \nthat meet eligibility criteria in terms of stated priorities, scope of interventions, information on all \nmajor sources and uses of funds, compliance with basic planning, and implementation and \nmonitoring arrangements.    \n \n72.  LGs will adopt the GRAP and adhere to the targets set for representation of women in \nbudget and social sector committees and other actions agreed to under the GRAP. \n \n4.  Rationalize Services and Set Minimum Standards  \n \n73.  SPG will promote targeting the poor, women, and vulnerable groups and include this \nfocus to determine the eligibility of DG and TMA plans.  \n \n74.  SPG  will  encourage  rational  distribution  of  services,  staff,  and  funds  through  the \nconditional grant mechanism. The LG will enter into partnership agreements with SPG to deliver \na package of basic services  within the sector, with funding from any sources,  in return for \nreceiving  formula-based  grants  through  Account  IV.  The  plans  will  be  set  within  certain \nparameters agreed to by LGs, to ensure that funds are spent on public sector priorities. \nAccordingly, the LG will prepare sectoral work plans for social services, following the regular \nbudgeting processes of getting approval from budget and development committees and seeking \napproval from the respective councils.  \n \n75.  To address the chronic  yet critical issues of poor prioritization, overcommitment of \nfinancial resources to new initiatives, and low investments in operation and maintenance, LGs \nshould agree to operationalize existing services where possible before embarking on expansion. \nIn case of opening closed services or new services, the LG will need to submit a technical and \nfinancial feasibility study to demonstrate how the services will be operationalized.  \n \n76.  SPG  will  permit  selective,  location-specific  recruitment  of  female  teachers  and \nparamedics on merit and contract bases, and improve working conditions for female staff. SPG \nwill  also  implement  plans  to  reduce  staff  absenteeism  and  exploitation,  improve  staff \nmanagement and supervision, and enforce disciplinary decisions.     \n  \n ", "18    \n77.  SPG will develop interim policies for solid waste management and rural drinking water \nsupply, integrating the uniform policy with the new role of TMAs.    \n \n5.  Encourage Public-Private Partnership \n \n78.  SPG will prepare an overall plan to strengthen the role of CBOs. SPG  will improve \nregistration  and  monitoring  of  CBOs  and  improve  their  capacity  to  achieve  the  required \nstandards and make them eligible for funding through a simple accreditation and training \nprocess. Under the TA, SPG will contract NGOs to build the capacity of social services. \n \n79.  LGs will improve the funding of CBOs. LGs will distribute a share of their additional funds \ndirectly to CBOs (including SMCs, health boards, and VDAs) based on a formula approved by \nPFC. The share to CBOs is expected to increase to 25% of the total flow of funds to LGs. LGs \nwill ensure that funds allocated for SMCs and other CBOs are transferred to their accounts \nwithin 2 months of these CBOs becoming eligible for funding. To be eligible for funding, these \nCBOs must be registered entities and sign a memorandum of understanding with the LG \nstipulating the terms and conditions of use of funds.  \n \n80.  SMCs will receive funding to improve basic school conditions. While in principle any \neligible SMC can be supported, about two thirds of primary schools already receive Government \nfunding. The Program will support expansion of all SMCs of schools up to grade 12, including \nkindergarten but not colleges. Support to SMCs will be based on the number of pupils in school \nrather than classrooms, so that shelterless schools will also be supported. If the DG so desires, \nnongovernment schools may also be supported. The support will amount to PRs167 per child in \nschool, and will be used for school operation and maintenance, and to provide textbooks, basic \nequipment, and furniture. SMCs will be allowed to hire teachers on contract basis, and assistant \nteachers for home schools and kindergarten. SMCs will be required to monitor the attendance of \nteachers and pupils.  \n \n81.  Eligible health boards, patients associations, or comparable CBOs will receive funding \nfor specific health facilities to improve operation and maintenance, including procurement of \nequipment and supplies. To be eligible, health boards must be registered, use participatory \nplanning processes, have at least two female members, and maintain proper financial records. \nHealth boards will be allowed to retain user fees and use the earnings for the facility. There \nshould be clear advertisement of the fee structure and easy waiver arrangements. Examples of \nthese arrangements are in place in Khairpur district, which serves as a model.      \n \n82.  VDAs and comparable CBOs will receive funding from TMAs to improve small water and \nsanitation schemes, offer hygiene education, and set up a revolving fund to install household \nlatrines and improve garbage collection. Schools and clinics will be given priority. The subsidy \nwill be linked to population size.    \n \n83.  DGs and TMAs may decide to use part of the funds to contract NGOs and other civil \nsociety organizations to improve social services, including building the capacity of CBOs. While \nseveral competent NGOs are currently working in Sindh, overall capacity remains limited. The \nTA under the Program will, as required, build capacity of these NGOs to support CBOs. LGs will \nalso be supported with the selection and contracting of NGOs. For special purposes, NGOs may \nalso be contracted directly under the TA project.  \n \n \n \n ", "    19 \nC.  Important Features \n \n84.  Given past experiences, the importance of supporting governance reforms in devolved \nsocial services cannot be underestimated. The DSSP is primarily a governance program that \naims to build local responsibility and capacity to undertake effective planning and efficient \nexecution of demand-driven plans to address prioritized needs in the social sector. Technical \napproaches are more or less based on international standards, but may slightly vary from place \nto place according to local circumstances, technical capacity, and funds.    \n \n85.  The Program has four important features:  \n \n(i)  The Program provides for an enabling environment by creating fiscal space, \nadequate and timely flow of funds, policy support, and linkages in the social \nsector. It provides for an innovative fund flow mechanism by channeling program \nfunds directly to LGs through Account IV.  \n \n(ii)  The  Program  offers  flexible  financial  and  technical  support  to  the  LGs  for \nadopting more effective, demand-driven, and participatory planning processes to \nidentify gaps, and rationalize and develop services. \n \n(iii)  At this early stage of LG, the Program pushes community participation and \npartnership with NGOs. While it may be argued that this step may be premature, \nit occurs at a time of transition when routine has not yet been established, and \ngives the opportunity to strengthen the roles of the community and NGOs.  \n \n(iv)  In  addition  to  the  built-in  synergies  available  from  the  TA  component,  the \nProgram provides for establishing linkages with a number of ongoing initiatives \naimed at supporting the decentralized system. Foremost among these is the \nDSP, which is a program for building the capacity of LGs in basic areas such as \naccounting, budgeting, and auditing as well as supporting the development of \nnew institutions in the field of governance. The DSSP will be implemented in \nclose coordination with the DSP to ensure complementarity of efforts. In fact, \nsome outcomes of the DSSP will ride on the successful outcomes of both the \nDSP and SAC, the broad-based macro reforms agenda sponsored by the World \nBank. In the case of the DSP, successful implementation of the capacity-building \ninitiatives in budgeting will, for example, enable the DSSP to add more specific \nbudgeting and performance orientation techniques, while the civil service reforms \nand fiscal discipline that SAC seeks to develop will provide a more enabling \nenvironment for the DSSP components. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n86.  In support of the Program, ADB proposes to provide a program loan of Special Drawing \nRights (SDR)69,843,000 ($100 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (ADF), \nand a program loan of \u00a511,968,550,000 ($110 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR). The loans will support the policy reforms as described in the development \npolicy letter and the policy matrix. The resource cost of adjustment is estimated at $255 million \nequivalent over 3 years for devolving administrative powers to the LGs, up-front funding to LGs, \ncapacity building, policy reforms, augmenting and sustaining social services, and public-private \npartnerships. ADB will also support a TA project loan of SDR6,984,000 ($10 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (ADF), as described in para. 105 onwards.   \n ", "20    \n87.  The ADF loan of SDR69,843,000 (equivalent to $100 million) will have a term of 24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter; and other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and \nProgram Agreements. The TA loan of SDR6,984,000 ($10 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an \ninterest of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. Both loans will be transferred \nfrom the Government to SPG on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to the \nGovernment. The foreign exchange risk shall be borne by SPG. \n \n88.  The Government has requested a loan of \u00a511,968,550,000 (equivalent to $110 million) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Program. The loan will have a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility (LBL); including a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 0.5% of the loan amount; and such \nother terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for this decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LBL \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB.  \n \n89.  The loans are in support of policy reforms that address long-standing issues in the social \nsector and propose major, permanent adjustments in the organization of social services to \nimprove social sector impact and participation of the poor. The reforms complement the reforms \ncarried out under World Bank\u2019s SAC, ADB\u2019s DSP, and proposed external assistance of the EC \nand USAID. The policy loans are justified by the content and expected impact of policy reforms \nand associated adjustment costs.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Executing Agency \n \n90.  The Sindh Finance Department will be the Executing Agency and will be responsible for \noverall program planning, coordination, monitoring, and TA support. The Sindh Planning and \nDevelopment Department and PLDs will plan, implement and monitor sector-specific policy \nreforms. DGs will be the implementing agencies for the conditional grant support to DGs for the \neducation and health sectors, and TMAs for WSS. LGs will assume responsibility for CBOs as \ndevelopment partners and monitor their activities. Appendix 7 shows the program organization \nand responsibilities.   \n \n91.  SPG will establish a steering committee to be chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary, \nPlanning and Development, and with members of the finance and line departments, DGs, TMAs \nand civil society. The committee will be responsible for overall strategic guidance, program \ncoordination, monitoring, and reporting to SPG. At least two women will be members of the \nsteering committee. The committee will advise the PFC on the distribution and use of funds.      \n \n92.      A program support unit (PSU) will be established in the Finance Department for the \npurpose of program management and monitoring, and TA management. There will be 16 local \nsupport units (LSUs) supporting all districts and all TMAs in Sindh. The director of the PSU will \nbe a senior government officer not below grade 19. The PSU will have a Program coordinator \nwho may be a Government official or may be engaged on contract basis.   \n ", "    21 \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n93.  The program support and policy reforms will be implemented over 3 years, and will be \ncompleted on 1 February 2007.   \n \n  3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n94.  The loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced in and \nprocured from ADB member countries, excluding listed ineligible items and imports financed by \nother multilateral and bilateral sources (Appendix 8 lists the ineligible items). The Borrower will \ncertify that (i) if the loan proceeds will finance goods already imported, the volume of eligible \nimports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested withdrawal, or (ii) if the \nloan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of the eligible imports immediately \npreceding  a  1-year  period  will  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  requested \nwithdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn from the loan account during the \nsucceeding 1-year period. The program loans will be used for 3 years, 1 February 2004\u20131 \nFebruary 2007. Disbursement will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans, \napproved by the ADB\u2019s Board on 16 April 1998. \n \n4.  Use of Counterpart Funds \n \n95.  Counterpart funds generated by loan proceeds will be used to provide budgetary support \nfor devolved  social services. The ADF program loan of $100 million equivalent and OCR \nprogram loan of $110 million equivalent will be used over 3 years and released in periods of at \nleast one year, in three tranches\u2014the equivalent of $100 million, $70 million, and $40 million\u2014\nupon fulfillment of the respective conditions shown in the policy matrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n96.  SPG,  through  the  steering  committee,  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  reforms \nenvisaged under the DSSP. Each year, SPG and ADB will carry out a policy review to assess \nthe achievement of policy reforms. Monitoring will also be an ongoing exercise through the PSU \nand LSUs, and through support from DSP. Monitorable and time-bound actions are reflected in \nthe policy matrix.       \n \n97.  SPG will use the counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the policy loans to \nfinance costs associated with implementing the package of policy reforms. SPG will include the \ncounterpart funds in the provincial consolidated fund (rather than outside the budget), under the \nprovincial  allocable  component  for  onward  distribution  to  LGs.  SPG  has  agreed  to  make \nprogram funds available as an additionality to be passed on as grant to DGs, TMAs, and CBOs \nbased on a PFC-approved formula. SPG and ADB will set financial benchmarks and targets and \nmonitor the use of counterpart funds by tracking funds flow from PFC to LGs to beneficiaries. \nAnalyzing the distribution and use of funds for the gender and poverty reduction goals will \nreceive special attention. Appendix 9 summarizes the use of program funds.      \n \n98.   The flow of funds has been elaborated in the policy actions. LGs will use the counterpart \nfunds in a flexible manner among the three sectors based on a participatory planning process to \nmeet the particular needs and priorities of the citizens. While LGs will be automatically eligible \nfor their formula-based allocations, there will be conditions on the use of funds to reinforce the \npolicy  reforms.  Overall  conditions  follow:  (i)  participatory  planning  will  include  female \nrepresentation in decision-making bodies; (ii) plans rationalize the scope and distribution of \nservices, (iii) benefits will be targeted to poor populations, particularly women; (iv) plans have to \nfit the overall expenditure plan of the LG, and (v) monitoring and accounting arrangements are \n ", "22    \nin place. The annual plans will clearly show that the funds do not replace any other funds, and \nthat regular allocations for social services are at least maintained at previous levels. Through \nworkshops, SPG will finalize with LGs the overall conditions and activities for which the funds \nmay be used, update these annually, and perhaps add conditions and incentives related to the \ndistribution of resources among locations, components and categories. However, the aim is to \nkeep funding as flexible as possible so as to encourage ownership. Joint review processes will \nneed to strike a careful balance between local autonomy and efficient use of resources.     \n \n99.   If LG performance is not satisfactory, the steering committee may decide to suspend the \nflow of funds to the concerned LG until satisfactory arrangements have been put in place. \nDistribution  of  funds  to  CBOs  will  be  based  on  yearly  verification  of  their  needs-based, \ntransparent, and accountable use of funds. For this purpose, CBOs will need to meet certain \nbasic requirements like having books of account that can be audited, and record of staff \nattendance and utilization. Funds allocated to LGs, if unused, will lapse at the end of the fiscal \nyear and may be redistributed among the active LGs. CBOs funds may be retained for 2 years.  \nFunds allocated to CBOs may not be used or retained by LGs.     \n    \n100.  The LGs may also use the conditional grant for PPP with NGOs or the private sector, or \nseek support from provincial institutions for capacity building. This would need to be indicated in \nthe annual plan and otherwise fulfill certain criteria of scope, qualifications, accounts and audit.        \n \n  5.  Auditing and Reporting \n \n101.  Prior to withdrawal, Government will open an account at State Bank of Pakistan to \nreceive all loan proceeds. The account will be established, managed, operated, and liquidated \nin accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The PSU will submit to ADB quarterly reports on \nthe policy reform measures.     \n \n102.  The inception report and quarterly reports must reach ADB not later than 6 weeks after \nthe due date. The annual reports and program completion reports must reach ADB not later \nthan 3 months after the due date. Based on an agreed-upon format, the reports will summarize \nprogress made in narrative form and according to key input and process indicators, corrective \nactions as necessary, and plans for the next period.  \n \n6.  Program Performance Management System \n103.  Closely linked to the DSP, program performance monitoring and evaluation will develop \na  system  to  monitor  SPG  inputs  (counterpart  funds,  sector  financing,  policy  reforms, \nrecruitments, etc.) based on reports, sector output indicators (disaggregated utilization and \nother indicators) using existing monitoring systems, and coverage and impact indicators based \non surveys that are disaggregated by districts. For the water sector, a separate monitoring and \nevaluation  instrument  will  be  developed.  The  PSU  will  be  responsible  for  the  program \nperformance management system, including monitoring sector financing, policy actions, and \nprogram indicators based on the policy matrix. At quarterly intervals, the PSU will prepare a \nreport for the steering committee for review and action. SPG will support a basic record system \nto monitor funding and progress of DG, TMAs and CBOs to coordinate social sector financing. \nWorkshops,  field  visits,  and  other  participatory  activities  will  be  carried  out  to  consult \nstakeholders on progress.  \n \n \n \n ", "    23 \n  7.  Program Review   \n \n104.  SPG (PSU) will forward key reports of the program performance management system to \nADB on a quarterly basis. SPG will also prepare the inception report, quarterly and annual \nprogress  reports,  and  a  program  completion  report.  The  reports  will  use  clear  and  well-\ndocumented indicators for monitoring policy reforms, use of counterpart funds, and program \nperformance. The Program focus on institutional reforms is complex and needs intensive follow-\nup and dialogue with SPG. ADB will carry out an inception mission, biannual review missions, \nand a program completion mission. SPG and ADB, with the assistance of an independent \nexpert, will conduct a comprehensive midterm review in the last quarter of the second year of \nimplementation to evaluate progress with policy reforms including financial flows, LG activities, \npublic-private  initiatives,  service  delivery,  and  coverage  of  services.  During  each  mission, \nfindings will be discussed with SPG and an action plan agreed to. Similar to the DSP, the DSSP \nwill have an annual performance review to determine program progress, compliance with policy \nconditions for the tranche releases, and Government and ADB efforts; and agree on a plan of \naction. The review will use a participatory process with field visits, or may use the services of a \nconsultant to make an initial field assessment.     \n \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n105.  The TA aims to (i) strengthen sector and program management and monitoring, (ii) \ndevelop LGs and CBO governance capacity in social services, and (iii) support sector work on \nspecific policy reforms to improve sector performance. This includes support to strengthen \nlinkages and cooperation between stakeholders, establish proper accounting practices, and \nmonitoring and evaluation of sector financing and performance. \n  \nB.  Components and Output \n1.  Program and Sector Management and Monitoring  \n106.  The TA will support the PSU and LSUs to ensure that all initiatives envisioned under the \nDSSP are carried out as per the agreed-upon Policy matrix. The PSU will be responsible for \nprogram monitoring and TA implementation. The PSU and LSUs will collaborate with LGs to \ntrack sector financing and monitor financial management. The PSU will also monitor and \nevaluate sector performance using existing management information systems, improve these as \nappropriate, and work with other agencies conducting surveys.  \n \n  2.  Governance Capacity Building  \n \n107.  The TA will support capacity building for the social sectors, initially through PSU and \nLSUs, but also through provincial training institutions, thereby supplementing efforts undertaken \nby the DSP and SAC, and efforts to be undertaken by EC and USAID in education. The PSU \nwill organize awareness campaigns about the poverty reduction strategy and devolved social \nservices. LSUs will strengthen LGs in the areas of annual planning and budgeting for social \nservices  using  a  participatory  approach,  gender  mainstreaming,  sector  management  and \nmonitoring, financial management as required, strengthening linkages of governments and \ncommunities, and capacity building of CBOs including SMCs, health boards and VDAs. The TA \nmay also support NGOs to prepare them for capacity building of CBOs or special services.     \n ", "24    \n  3.  Sector-Specific Reforms \n \n108.  PLDs will be assisted to examine a range of policy issues in the social sector and work \non specific policy reforms. In education, this includes the functioning of SMCs, contracting \nteachers, and affordability of education.  In the health sector, the critical activity is to establish \nhealth boards and patients associations to strengthen local participation in managing services. \nStudies  will  examine  contracting  arrangements  for  staff  and  PPP, improving the financial \nsustainability of health facilities, and rationalizing and operationalizing closed health facilities. In \nthe WSS, technical support will support monitoring systems, categorizing schemes, consumer \nsurveys, and preparing master plans for TMAs. Based on studies and using a  participatory \nprocess, interim policies for the sector will be prepared, including policies for drinking water \nsupply, and solid waste management in general and health facilities in particular.       \n \nC.  Financing Plan \n109.  The TA is estimated to cost $14.2 million equivalent, comprising $1.9 million (13%) in \nforeign exchange and $12.3 million equivalent (87%) in local currency cost (Appendix 10). ADB \nwill provide a loan of SDR6,984,000 from its Special Funds resources to finance up to 70% of \nthe total TA cost. The loan will cover the total foreign exchange cost and an estimated $8.1 \nmillion equivalent in local currency cost (66% of the total local currency cost). The term of the \nproposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft Technical Assistance Loan and Project Agreements. SPG \nwill finance $4.2 million equivalent of the TA cost for rental facilities and utilities, counterpart \nstaff, communication, grants for civil society organizations, training and workshops, and taxes.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Executing Agency \n \n110.  The Finance Department, Sindh, will be the Executing Agency. The structure for TA \nsupervision is similar to that for the program loan. The TA will be managed by the PSU, as per \nadvice of the steering committee. In all DGs and TMAs, local counterparts will be identified to \nwork with the PSU and LSUs.    \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n111.  The TA will be implemented for 4 years and be completed by 1 February 2008.      \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n112.  All ADB-financed procurement for the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Contract  packages  for  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  follow  international \nshopping procedures, except for vehicles, which may be procured through local competitive \nbidding (LCB). Minor packages costing $100,000 equivalent or less may be procured through \nLCB or direct purchase, as per SPG standard Procurement, acceptable to ADB.  \n \n  4.   Consulting Services \n \n113.  The TA will require consulting services of 36 person-months (international) and 1,926 \n(domestic).  Under the TA, international and domestic consultants will be recruited by SPG \n ", "    25 \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engaging domestic consultants. The international level program coordinator will \nbe hired as an individual on contract basis.24 The domestic consultants (with person-months) of \nthe PSU include a finance and governance specialist (33), a poverty and gender specialist (24), \na capacity building and training specialist (24), a community organization specialist (24), a \ncontracting  and  personnel  management  specialist  (24),  and  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist (33). The LSUs will include finance and governance experts (528), engineers (528), \nand monitoring and evaluation experts (528). The sector reform units will be supported by \neconomists (72), an education reform specialist (24), a health sector reform specialist (24), a \nwater supply engineer (36), and an environment/solid waste management specialist (24). The \ndistrict consultants will be recruited through firms. The other consultants will be recruited either \nas  individuals  or  through  firms.  The  terms  of  reference  of  consulting  services  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n5.  Disbursements and Reporting \n \n114.  SPG will open a dollar imprest account at the National Bank of Pakistan within 3 months \nof loan effectiveness. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Loan Disbursements, as amended from time \nto time. ADB will advance 6 months of estimated expenditures (about $1 million) into the imprest \naccount. The ADB statement of expenditure procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish \nthe imprest account for individual payments not exceeding $50,000.   \n \n115.  SPG  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  imprest  fund  and  TA \nexpenditures in accordance with sound accounting principles. SPG will have such accounts and \nrecords audited by external auditors in accordance with standards acceptable to ADB. Certified \ncopies of audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 9 months after the close of the fiscal \nyear.  \n \n116.  As in the program loans, SPG will submit the inception report and quarterly reports to \nADB within 6 weeks of the end of the reporting period. In addition, SPG will submit to ADB \nannual reports and a TA completion report within 3 months of the end of the reporting period. \nBased on an agreed-upon format, the reports will summarize progress made in narrative form, \nprovide key input and process indicators, propose corrective actions as necessary, and propose \nplans for the next period. The annual and TA completion reports will include a summary \nfinancial account of the TA. SPG will ensure that the submission of reports, audited accounts, \nand financial statements comply with ADB\u2019s revised guidelines of 1998.  \n \n117.  The Provincial Steering Committee and ADB will monitor the TA as an integral part of \nthe program performance management system. The TA inputs, process, and output indicators \nwill be monitored to determine how they affect impact. Capacity building requirements will be \ncontinuously monitored and reassessed so that capacity building can be tracked as an ongoing \nprocess.     \n     \n118.  ADB will combine TA reviews with program reviews (para. 104). The missions will pay \nspecial attention to the capacity of the PSU and the LSU; the hiring and preparation of experts; \nand  the  work  of  experts,  including  the  time  spent  working  with  Government  counterparts, \n                                                 \n24 A separate advisory technical assistance grant of $400,000 is included in ADB\u2019s country program for 2004 to \nfinance international advisers on social sector reform.     \n \n ", "26    \nworking with councils to improve participatory planning processes, and working with DGs and \nTMAs to improve their planning, procurement, management, and monitoring activities. After \nthese reviews, modifications of scope and implementation arrangements may be proposed.       \n \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Program Benefits   \n \n119.  Social Sector Financing.  The DSSP will result in an increased budget for the social \nsector, a new funding mechanism for devolved social services, and better cash flow. Qualifying \nSMCs, health boards and water associations will be financed directly. SPG will also give grants \nto NGOs to build the capacity of CBOs and other activities. Water charges will be rationalized to \nmake them more pro-poor and consumption-driven in the case of water.        \n \n120.  Participatory Planning. The DSSP will increase capabilities and the participation of \ncommon and special councilors in decision-making bodies in DGs, TMAs, and UAs. Special \nattention will be given to the participation of female councilors. Efforts will be made to ensure \nadequate representation of civil society and NGOs in district planning activities. Mechanisms will \nbe  set  up  to  clarify  responsibilities  and  thus  improve  collaboration  among  political \nrepresentatives and bureaucrats and improve coordination of development activities.       \n \n121.  Rationalization of Services.  The TA will provide major support for building the capacity \nof DGs, TMAs, UAs, and CBOs to undertake proper planning, implementation, and monitoring \nand thus ensure efficient, equitable, and effective use of limited resources. Each district, and in \nthe case of the water sector, each TMA will directly be supported by experts who will provide \nhands-on experience in this field.       \n \n122.  Community Organizations. SPG will use the TA fund to build the capacity of CBOs, \nSMCs, health boards, and VDAs, to qualify them as recipients of SPG financing to improve local \nsocial  services.  Qualifying  organizations  will  eventually  be  allowed  to  operate  their  own \nservices, including contracting of staff. Such community organization will also benefit other \nsectors and overall improve devolution and governance in the public sector.       \n \nB.  Impacts   \n \n1.  Social Sector Impact \n \n123.  The Program will result in higher school participation and completion rates, especially of \ngirls, due to (i) better access to schools for village children, (ii) contracting of female teachers, \n(iii) better school conditions, and (iv) more affordable secondary schools. Similarly, improved \naccess to female health staff and field workers, will improve reproductive health, and reduce \nmaternal  mortality,  and  curb  fertility  through  noninvasive  methods.  The improvement and \nreopening of schools and clinics and provision of accessible clean drinking water will have a \nmajor impact on the social status of the population. The currently sourced water is generally \nunfit for human consumption and carries the risk of waterborne diseases. Poor-quality water is \nresponsible for high levels of infant mortality, while high levels of morbidity cause frequent \nschool absenteeism in children and loss of workdays for adults. The availability of basic services \nand clean water will create better living conditions for the people and will enhance their \nproductivity levels. SPG aims to increase gross primary enrollment from 65% to 80%, increase \n ", "    27 \nrural access to safe drinking water from 24 % to 30%, increase full immunization coverage of \nchildren from 50% to 85%, and reduce infant mortality from 80 to 70 per 1,000 live births.    \n     \n  2.  Poverty and Gender Impact \n \n124.  Support for social services, devolution, and community participation and organization will \nhave a positive impact on the poor. Funding, access, and quality of social services are all \nexpected to improve. More chiIdren will go to school, and receive better-quality education, which \nwill have an impact on the entire family. Better health care should also reduce income erosion \nand improve productivity. The Program is targeting all districts in Sindh by supporting public \nsocial services used mostly by the poor. The majority of the beneficiaries are likely to be poor. \nThe summary poverty impact of policy actions is in Appendix 11.    \n \n125.  Female councilors will be assisted to learn how to participate in council meetings and \nplanning activities. Many LGs and CBOs are keen to hire female teachers and paramedics, and \nimprove schools, and health and water and sanitation services that will particularly benefit girls. \nThe Program\u2019s impact will be monitored through surveys, including equity indicators.   \n \n126.  The Program and TA activities are intended to improve governance in the social sector. \nThe result should be more pro-poor allocation and more efficient use of resources. Improved \ngovernance also involves disciplinary actions against poorly performing staff. Retrenchment of \nsome staff can be expected, with a possible adverse impact on their families. Currently, water \ncharges are deducted at source, and are invisible for some who do not pay any charges. The \npractice, however, often results in poor services and waste of funds that could be used for other \nservices.  Overall,  the  price  of  water  services  is  expected  to  fall  and  be  linked  to  actual \nconsumption. The water experts will carry out a consumer survey and participator planning \nprocess to assess the implications of proposed pricing reforms on the poor and how they can be \naddressed. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n        3.  Financial and Economic Impacts \n \n127.  SPG is increasing social sector spending under the PRSP to achieve its social sector \ngoals. The DSSP requires SPG to approve additional funds for the social sector, improve cash \nflow, and provide up-front financing. The program costs to the Government are $45 million \nhigher than the size of the program loans during the program period. SPG hopes to finance the \ncosts through debt reduction and a tax increase averaging 15% per year. It is believed that the \neconomic returns from better education, health, and drinking water nearby will outweigh the \ncosts of the tax increase. With infrastructure and salaries already paid for, a modest increase in \ntargeted spending for quality enhancing actions will greatly improve use and efficiency.  \n \n4.  Institutional Impact  \n \n128.  The Program will contribute to the overall devolution reform process. Foremost, it will \nstrengthen LGs to contribute to one of the largest institutional transition in Pakistan. It is \nexpected to have a major impact on governance in the social sector and will help create a \nfavorable environment for improved transparency and accountability, empowerment of common \ncitizens, and the rule of law. The Program will particularly help strengthen and increase the \nnumber of CBOs\u2014including SMCs, health boards, and VDAs. Through opportunities for PPP, \nthe Program will also strengthen local NGOs, and thereby help to expand the private sector.  \n \n \n ", "28    \n  5.  Environmental Aspects    \n \n129.  The DSSP is classified as environmental category B. Apart from hospital and health \ncenter wastes, and  water supply, sanitation and garbage collection, no major environmental \nhazards are anticipated. The Environmental Protection Agency of SPG and the PSU, supported \nby a consultant, will prepare environmental plans for managing hospital and health center \nwastes and for other types of facilities and operations. They will ensure that environmental \nmeasures are included in upgrading the operations of district health agencies and other types of \nservices to avoid significant environmental impacts. The environmental assessment summary \nincluding an assessment of the policy actions and an environmental management plan are in \nSupplementary Appendix D.   \n \nC.  Risks \n \n  1.  Political Risks \n \n130.  Sindh\u2019s political instability, and therefore sustained commitment to the  devolution and \ngovernance reform agenda, is considered a major risk for the Program. There are dissenting \nvoices among provincial stakeholders. Major issues in Sindh are the sharp urban-rural divide, \nand resistance of those in control to giving up old privileges. That majority of the elected council \nheads and deputy heads are from landed families highlights the danger of capture of DGs by \nlocal  elites,  and  subsequent  continuation  of  privileges.  While  there  are  early  signs  of \nimprovement, the conceptual framework of structural changes leading to greater accountability \nat the local level still needs to be demonstrated. Much exchange of ideas and clarification will be \nneeded to ensure political support at all levels and put a transparent and fair system in place.  \n \n  2.  Economic and Financial Risks   \n \n131.  The economic and financial risks are considered less prominent.  There are sector \nfinancing risks linked to the economy, as was experienced during the SAP, which was seriously \naffected by the fiscal crisis of the 1990s. Continuing lack of funds resulted in staff shortages and \nlack  of  nonsalary  recurrent  allocations  that  undermined  the  services.  The  current \nmacroeconomic picture looks much better given Pakistan\u2019s overall international and economic \nperformance  in  the  past  few  years,  a  healthy  budget  surplus,  fair  economic  growth,  and \nexpected  reduction  of  debt  to  4.5%  of  GDP  in  FY2003  and  4.0%  in  FY2004.  However, \ncontinuing economic growth will  depend on a benign external environment for debt servicing \nand investment, which is tied to the political situation in Pakistan. Furthermore, the drought of \nthe past few years demonstrated Pakistan\u2019s dependency on ecological conditions and the water \nresource management systems. The resulting increase in rural poverty is believed to have had \na major negative impact on school enrollment. The serious levels of poverty in rural areas and \nurban slums, in combination with social inequity, pose major program constraints.                     \n \n  3.  Capacity Constraints   \n  \n132.  The  federal  Government  decided  to  opt  for  fast-track  devolution  with  remarkable \npolitical, administrative, and fiscal restructuring; development of new systems and guidelines; \nand training of administrators and councilors, all within the span of 1 year. However, the \ndevolved system still needs to be fully operationalized and PLDs should provide full support. A \nmajor concern is the limited capacity of the LGs and CBOs. Major capacity-building efforts that \nwill benefit the social sector are underway, but specific support for capacity building in the \ndevolved social sector is largely lacking. In particular the capacity of CBOs is of concern.  \n ", "    29 \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n133.

Education \n \n1.  Status. With a population of 35 million and for its imperative socioeconomic growth, \nthe province of Sindh faces the immense challenge of rampant illiteracy.  Sindh's literacy \nrate is 46%, the same as the nation's. The rural literacy rate is much lower than the urban \nrate, and for females it is much lower than for males (40% versus 13% in rural areas, and \n72% versus 52% in urban areas).  \n \n2.  The education sector under the Department of Education and Literacy is the biggest \ndevolved sector in Sindh. As in other sectors, there is much disparity between urban and \npoorer rural and slum areas and male and female students and teachers. Table A2.1 gives \nthe  distribution  of  schools,  students  and  services  according  to  the  Sindh  Education \nManagement Information census 2001\u20132002. \n \nTable A2.1: Public Education Establishments in Sindh \nLevel  Schools  Teachers  Students \n(no.)

There are about 7,000 private schools and educational institutions. The 95.5% of \nprivate enrollment in Sindh is in urban areas. Local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \noperate 1\u20132 classroom-type schools in villages. Enrollment indicators over the past years \nhave not changed. In addition to poor primary schools participation, there is a sudden drop in \nmiddle school attendance (Table A2.2).  \n \nTable A2.2: Total Net Enrolment Rates in Sindh \n      Participation Rate (%) \nType  Level  Age  Boys  Girls  Total \nSchools  Primary  4\u20139  46  34  40 \n  Middle  10\u201312  18  15  16 \n  Secondary  13\u201314  21  16  19 \nSchools/College  Intermediate  15\u201316  13  13  13 \nCollege  Degree  17\u201318    2     3     3 \n  Postgraduate  19\u201320    0     0     0 \n             Source: Education Monitoring Information System, Government of Sindh.              \n \n4.  Key Issues. Low participation rate is linked to the quality of education, poverty, and \nsocial constraints. Economic stagnation and drought of the past few years have caused \nstagnating enrollment. Similar to the findings of a study in Punjab,1 poverty in Sindh is seen \nas the main reason for children not attending school (Table A2.3). Other factors in Sindh are \nwalking distance, security, lack of basic amenities, and teacher absenteeism (in part due to \nprohibitive transport costs).    \n          \n \n                                                 \n1  Multidonor Support Unit. 2002.

School Management Committees. Establishing SMCs has been the major initiative \nfor improving schools. About 33% have received grants from the Government, and 25% \nhave been able to mobilize additional funds from their respective communities. As the funds \nare linked to the number of classrooms, Government grants are biased against shelterless \nschools. In many SMCs, the head teacher usually decides  how the Government grants \nshould be used, rather than encouraging parents to participate in decision making. Most \ncouncils find the list of eligible expenditure categories too narrow and rigid and demand \ngreater flexibility in the use of funds.        \n   \n6.  Facilities. School buildings are generally poor in rural areas compared with those in \nurban areas and private schools. Of the 15,000 shelterless schools in rural areas, about \n3,100 are being upgraded with World Bank assistance. Many schools in urban areas are \novercrowded, with children sitting on the veranda, under the trees, and on the roof. The \neasier way to increase school enrollment is no doubt adding classrooms in urban areas, as \ndemand is high and teachers are in surplus. Lack of amenities, furniture, and maintenance \nare  problems  affecting  most  government  schools.  The  supply  of  textbooks  to  primary \nschools has improved with external assistance, and could be expanded to higher grades.  \n   \n7.  Human Resources. Even if 33\u201340% of posts were vacant, a ban on recruitment was \nmaintained  during  Social  Action  Program  (Sector)  Project  II,  as  part  of  public  sector \nrationalization. This was expected to deal with surplus teachers. However, due to politics, \npoor rural working conditions, and lack of incentives, redeployment has not been successful. \nIrregular transfer practices continue. The Government is now planning to introduce a policy \nof  exclusive  female  teachers  for  primary  schools,  so  as  to  make  coeducation  more \naccessible to girls. Hiring of teachers on contract basis and from the community should also \nhelp in reducing staff absenteeism. However, there is no evidence to suggest that locally \nhired teachers, including for private schools, perform better. Supervision, monitoring, and \ndisciplinary action are also needed.   \n \n8.  Quality of Education. Primary instruction is notoriously poor (parrot method) and \nhas probably deteriorated. Many teachers are untrained. The Government is now following a \npolicy of hiring matriculate graduates as teachers and training them through in-service \ntraining, rather than preservice training. However, the performance of trained teachers is not \nmuch better, for a variety of reasons. Enrollment data are misleading, as attendance is \nusually much lower. Monitoring of pupil and teacher attendance is a priority. The curriculum \nand examination system need to be updated (this is a federal responsibility).   \n \n ", "36 Appendix 2 \n \n9.  Financing. Education up to class 10 has been made free in Government schools. \nUnder the World Bank\u2019s structural adjustment credit, the budget for education has increased. \nIn 2002\u20132003, PRs19.9 billion was allocated for education: PRs16.5 billion for salaries, \nPRs1.6 billion  for nonsalary recurrent expenditures, and PRs1.6 billion for development \nexpenditures. The budget for primary school SMCs increased from PRs1.1 billion in 2001\u2013\n2002 to PRs4.5 billion in 2002\u20132003, on the basis of PRs167 per child per year for use on a \nneed basis. This does not include support for katchi class, shelterless schools, and class 6 \nupward. PRs180 million was spent to distribute free textbooks to students of all primary \nschools, and PRs270 million on scholarships for girl students of middle schools (classes 6\u2013\n8) at PRs100 per child per month. PRs50 million from the regular budget of 2002\u20132003 is \nallocated to districts for teacher training.   \n \n10.  Policy. The  National Policy of Education, 1998\u20132010, aims for universal primary \neducation with 100% net participation, quality and functionality in the secondary stage with \nparticipation  increased  to  50%,  greater  emphasis  on  rural  female  education,  and \nimprovement in quality to meet the demands of the job market by 2004. Targets continue to \nbe high, such as increasing net enrolment rate from 65% in 2001 to 75% in 2004, and \nincreasing literacy from 47% to 60% in the same period. For a holistic approach to education \na sector-wide strategy entailing legislative, administrative, and financial actions at all levels \nhas been adopted.2 The Education Sector Reforms for 2001\u20132004, a 3-year action plan to \nimplement  the  policy,  includes  Literacy  through  Education  for  All  supported  by  the \nCompulsory Primary Education Ordinance. It includes resource mobilization including debt \nswap for education, decentralization under the devolution plan, public-private partnership \nand community participation. Its actions include generating political will, mainstreaming \nmadrassahs,3 introducing  outcome-based  planning  and  budgeting,  and  demand-based \neducation.   \n \n11.  Priority investments are (i) support for SMCs ($20 million), (ii) construction of 3,000 \nshelterless schools ($30 million), (iii) reopening of 5,000 closed schools ($5 million), (iv) \nupgrading primary schools to elementary schools ($150 million), (v) change of 1,000 schools \nto English medium ($10 million), and (vi) upgrading of middle school to secondary school \n($150 million per school). In- service teacher training is earmarked for major grant financing.        \n \nB.  Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector \n \n12.  Status. Sindh\u2019s important health indices are not good. Infant and child mortality rates \nper  1,000  live  births  are  85  and  103,  respectively,  in  particular  due  to  diarrhea  and \nrespiratory infections. About 40% of children under the age of 5 years are malnourished. \nOne quarter of children are born with low birth weight. Drug-resistant tuberculosis and \nmalaria are common. The number of maternal deaths has declined due to a reduction in \nfertility. The total fertility rate has dropped from around 6.3 to 4.7 in 15 years, due to late \nmarriages and modern family planning practiced by 27% of married couples. However, the \nrisk of dying during pregnancy has not declined much. The maternal mortality ratio has \nremained  at  about  350  maternal  deaths  per  100,000  live  births.  Sindh  is  also  facing \nincreasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases. About 50% of the disease burden is \naccounted for by non-communicable diseases, 38% by communicable diseases, and 12% by \nmaternal and prenatal conditions. The prevalence of noncommunicable diseases is expected \nto increase to 70% by 2020, and increase the demand for costly interventions in chronic \nconditions.  \n  \n                                                 \n2  Zafar, F. 2002.

Islamabad: Canadian International \nDevelopment Agency. \n3  Religious schools. \n ", "  Appendix 2  37                                      \n13.  Services. Coverage and output indicators show the shortcomings of service delivery. \nFull immunization coverage of infants is 50%. Less than 40% of women deliver in health \nfacilities, and less than 38% of them receive skilled assistance during delivery. Availability of \n24-hour basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care in public sector facilities is \nestimated at 15% and 25%, respectively. Health services are an inequitable mixture of a \nfairly large network of run-down public services; high-technology, expensive private sector \ncare; private practitioners; traditional healers; and shops and quacks. Provincial public health \nservices are extended through 1,324 facilities comprising 36 major hospitals, 73 district and \nsubdistrict hospitals, 98 rural health centers, 724 basic health units, 274 dispensaries, and \n119 other categories of facilities. The bed population ratio is 1:1,251. Following devolution, \nabout 400 facilities of defunct metropolitan and municipal corporations have been added. In \naddition, the federal Government runs vertical programs for immunization, tuberculosis, \nmalaria, HIV/AIDS4 control, nutrition, population welfare; and the national program for family \nplanning and primary health care supporting lady health workers. The lady health workers \nreach about one quarter of the poor, and provide basic care for women and children. ADB\u2019s  \nWomen\u2019s Health Project supports four district governments to improve obstetric services and \ngenerally make communities and services more responsive to the health needs of women.  \n \n14.  Financing. The health sector received 5\u20137% of the total provincial program of Sindh \nin the postdevolution years (FY2002 and FY2003). Districts received about 43% of the \nbudget in FY2003 (although salaries were retained at provincial levels). The provincial share \nof the annual development program increased from 41% in FY2002 to 63% in FY2003. In \nFY2003, of 83% PRs535 million was allocated to 5 medical colleges and 17% to 35 schools \nand  centers  for  paramedical,  nursing,  and  in-service training. The same year, tertiary \nhospitals were allocated 25% of the nondevelopment budget. Preventive health programs \nand foreign aided programs budgeted at PRs1.4 billion are linked to federal programs. The \ncounterpart  budgets  of  these  federal  programs  are  allocated  about  one  third  of  the \ndevelopment budget while the remaining is spent mostly on civil works. As a result, primary \ncare is seriously underfunded. Free public care is unavailable, as services carry both a \nformal and informal charge. Out-of-pocket spending is estimated at $7 per person per year. \nThe poor often rely on quacks and shops, resulting in poor quality care and income erosion.   \n \n15.  Services. The network of infrastructure has grown beyond the financial capacity of \nthe Government, at the cost of primary care and quality enhancing expenditures. A large \nnumber of small health facilities operate with very low attendance or are closed. Substantial \nrationalization of health services is needed, which is a politically sensitive matter. This \nshould go along with a redistribution of staff and improving the quality of services through \nbetter supplies and supervision. Vertical programs are undermining regular services and \nshould be integrated. The main reason for pursuing vertical programs is that it fits the \norientation of the international aid agencies that look for concrete objectives and measurable \noutcomes achieved in a stipulated period of time. These programs ignore the fact that they \ncan only be implemented because of existing health services.   \n \n16.  Human Resources. According to Department of Health estimates, the sector has an \napproximate sanctioned staff  strength  of  43,626.  An  additional  2,600  staffs  of  defunct \nmetropolitan and municipal corporations, district councils, and town committees have been \nbrought under the district after devolution. There are about 12,000 doctors, 2,000 nurses, \nand about 12,000  paramedics. Among the doctors in general cadre, 25% are female. The \ndoctor population and nurse population are 1:2,932 and 1:8,653, reflecting a major shortage \nof nurses.  The shortage of female staff in Sindh is linked to traditional views on the chastity \nof women. There are quotas allocated to each district for initial recruitment and persons \ndomiciled in a particular district are eligible for appointments. However, many staff members \noccupy a rural post while working in an urban institution. Besides social and security \n                                                 \n4  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.   \n ", "38 Appendix 2 \n \nproblems, working in rural areas is less rewarding than in urban areas. Long established \nstaff deployment practices via political pressures need to be replaced with merit-based \nrecruitment, posting, and transfers.  \n \n17.  Devolution.  The  devolved  health  sector  as  stated  in  Sindh  Local  Government \nOrdinance  2001  has  been  categorized  under  two  broad  functions,  public  health  and \npopulation welfare. The latter, however, continues to be vertical and federally funded and \nhas  not  been  devolved  at  administrative  and  financial  levels;  however,  but  functional \nintegration at service delivery level has been achieved to a certain degree in the districts. \nThere is considerable resistance on the part of officers to delegate authority. The main \nobstacle impeding better implementation of the devolution plan in the sector is not lack of \nprofessionals with managerial and technical capabilities, but the politicization of these posts.  \n \n18.  The formulation of annual development plans has now been devolved and is the \nresponsibility  of  the  district  team.  Documents  such  as  \u201cdevolution  of  powers  and \nrestructuring of departments\u201d prepared by health offices of districts Sukkur and Ghotki \nprovide useful information from which to assess the situation and to prioritize the tasks that \nlie ahead. Many districts have not yet done such systematic assessments, identification of \npriorities and indicators, and development of plans.  Several user-provider groups in Sindh \nare involved in such matters as setting user charges, repair and maintenance, determination \nof  opening  hours,  organizing  women  users  groups,  health  education,  counseling,  peer \nsupport, and arrangement of transport.    \n \n19.  Policy. The National Health Policy, 2001, aims to (i) reduce widespread prevalence \nof communicable diseases, (ii) address imbalances in primary and secondary services, (iii) \nremove professional and managerial deficiencies in the district health system, (iv) promote \ngreater gender equity, (v) bridge nutrition gaps in the target population, (vi) correct the urban \nbias in the health sector, (vii) introduce required regulation in the private sector, (viii) create \nmass awareness in public health matters, (ix) effect improvements in the drug sector, and (x) \nbuild capacity for health policy monitoring. The vision as stated in Population Policy, 2002, is \nto  achieve  population  stabilization  by  2020.  The  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  10-Year \nperspective plan (2001\u20132011) spells out the essential program elements that need to be in \nplace to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Sindh Poverty Reduction \nStrategy spells out the objectives in primary health care for the period 2001\u20132005.  \n \n20.  To capitalize on the opportunity of devolution in the health sector, a critical mass of \nactive and committed leaders will be needed. The medical associations and colleges should \nalso be brought on board. Current management strengthening needs to be followed with \nincreased delegation of authority, improved planning to rationalize services, and improved \nflow of funds. Strong political commitment is needed to contain the expansion of medical \ncolleges and tertiary hospitals. Training and working conditions for female staff need to be \nimproved. At the community level, efforts should be made to develop health boards to \nmaintain and operate the health services.  \n \nC.  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \n \n21.  Status. Two thirds of Sindh lies either in the brackish water zone or in the desert \nzone, and 17% in the sweet water zone. Rainfall is very low, and most rural people get water \nfrom the Indus River and its irrigation system, which is also under threat. The 18 million rural \npeople live in 5,871 scattered villages, two thirds of which have a population of less than \n5,000. In rural areas, piped water supply covers 14% and hand pumps 41%. The remaining \n45% of households rely on unsafe water, such as uncovered wells, rivers, and rain-fed or \ncanal-fed ponds that are often located at considerable distance from the homes. The burden \nof fetching water usually falls on women and girls. Overdrawing with mechanized pumps and \npoor maintenance of schemes cause water shortages. The water and sanitation sector \n ", "  Appendix 2  39                                      \n(WSS) infrastructure was often developed without analyzing maintenance and recurrent cost \nneeds, and without a master plan. Several hundred schemes that were politically motivated \nand  poorly  designed  have  been  abandoned.  Experience  has  also  shown  that  most \ncommunities can afford only low-cost services.  \n \n22.  In both rural and urban areas, drinking water is often polluted and distributed without \ntreatment. Sewerage treatment is absent except partially in Karachi. The lower income group \nis most affected by polluted water and water-related diseases. About 53% of the rural \npopulation lacks access to private toilet facilities including pit latrines. Many schools lack \nproper latrines, posing a problem for girls. Garbage litters the landscape. With the current \ntrend, the MDGs for the water sector are unlikely to be reached.     \n   \n23.  Roles.  Since  devolution,  the  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  has  been \nmerged with the local government department and responsibilities for planning and operating \nschemes have been devolved to taluka/town municipal administrations (TMAs). The director \ngeneral (Public Health Engineering) at Hyderabad and district executive officers were to \nprovide support for TMAs. The taluka officers (Infrastructure) were made responsible for \nwater supply and control and development of water resources, sewage treatment and \ndisposal, drainage, sanitation and solid waste collection, among others. However, TMAs \nhave not assumed this new role due to lack of funds, authority, and capacity to execute the \nnew responsibilities. For example, many engineers are still to be posted from the district to \nthe TMAs. The other bottleneck is the low procurement ceiling of goods and services.  \n \n24.  The private sector has been discouraged from getting involved in the sector due to \ndifficulties in collecting user charges and lack of legislative protection. The National Rural \nSupport Program, the Provincial Rural Support Program, and other large nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) are playing an important role in community development in the sector.  \n \n25.  Financing. TMAs can barely afford the establishment charges and related costs. \nIntegration of municipal services has overstaffed the TMAs whose capacity to collect local \nrevenue, such as octroi, has also been curtailed. Communities have come to rely on the \nGovernment  for  financing  the  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  services.  Many \nhouseholds cannot afford the excessive billings due to mismanagement of schemes. The \ngovernment of Sindh (SPG) decided to deduct payments at source, resulting in an almost \ntotal lack of funds for operation and maintenance for the past 2 years. TMA revenue \ncollection has also been curtailed.        \n \n26.  Policy and Plans. The SPG has resolved to continue implementing the rural WSS \nprograms in accordance with its uniform policy framework, which is promoting community \nownership and management of operation and maintenance of schemes. However, the newly \ninstalled TMAs are not familiar with this approach. SPG plans to build the capacity of TMAs \nthrough  posting  of  professional  staff  and  training,  and  establish  TMAs  in  all  aspects \n(financial, managerial, technical and social development) to manage the sector. SPG will \ntransfer funds directly to TMAs.  The directorate general at Hyderabad and district support \nunits will have a coordinating and support role. The Government wants to involve local \nNGOs in community development activities and to build the capacity of TMAs.  SPG wants \nto support each TMA to undertake surveys to (i) assess the technical and financial viability of \neach scheme; (ii) operationalize viable, need-based schemes; and (iii) execute small new \nwater supply and sanitation schemes in rural areas. To provide water supply to the presently \nuncovered population in Sindh, PRs67.5 billion or $1.2 billion would be required. SPG also \nplans  to  improve  garbage  disposal  with  the  assistance  of  the  private  sector,  provide \nincentives for latrines, and repair or replace urban sewerage systems. 5 \n                                                 \n5   ADB.  1998.

Tbe~ reforms are expected to enhancet he\nefficiency, equity, effectiveness and sustainability of public service delivery.\nThe Government of Sindh (Sindh) is fully supportive of these reforms program and has initiated\nits own broad governance programs including the SindhReforms Program and furthered the devolution\nagenda through implementation of the Sindh Local Government Ordinance. Sindh has also developed its\nPoverty Reduction Strategy to addressp overty issuesa nd create more economic opportunities.\n~\nThe social indicators of Sindh, the second most populated province of Pakistan, compare poorly\nwith other South Asian Countries similarly  placed economically. The social indicators present a dismal\npicture with more than 50% of the population illiterate, nearly half the children of school going age not\nattending school, a high infant mortality  rate of 10%, half of the children less than five years of age are\nmalnourished, and merely 15% of the rural population having accesst o safe drinking water and sanitation\nfacilities.

A key factor affecting the quality ofh1m1anc apital development\nhas been the constrained fiscal position in the province, with interest payments alone consuming over\n$200 million  per annum, 13% of  the total  budget for  FY  04 and greater than the entire annual\ndevelopmentp rogram.\nCognizant of the need to develop human capital to nurture economic groWth and reduce poverty,\nSindh is according high priority to the improvement in the delivery of social services.T  o this end, it has\nrealigned expenditures both  at the provincial  and the district  levels in  favour of  social services,\nparticularly  education and health and enhanced the transparency and efficiency  in the financing and\nmanagement of social sectors, by  devolving  decision making and finances to lower  fonnations of\ngovernment in 2001.

However, local governmentsr equire sustaineds upport to\nenable them to overcome the challengest hat they are facing in the transitory phase.\nSindh's social sector priorities are an integral part of its poverty alleviation strategy reflected in\nthe Poverty Reduction Strategy and the overall refornl agendao f the Sindh Reform Program. The Sindh\nReform Program aims to reverse the declining trend in social indicators through a three pronged poverty\nreduction strategy focusing on achieving a more equitable delivery of improved social services, creating\nemployment and skill  acquiring opportunities and extending micro credit to the poor. Sindh seeks to\ninstirute far reaching refonns in the social sectors by addressingt he core governance issues constraining\nthe efficient delivery of serVices, by opting for a need-basedr esource allocation mechanism, and by\nfostering community involvement in the delivery of social services.\nRecognizing the importance of  education for  economic growth and social hannony, Sindh\ninitiated a vigorous education sector refonn program in 2001, targeted at increasing literacy rates and\nimproving the quality of education combined with  the critical  systemic, institutional  and .governance\nreforms required to improve public service delivery. The key components of the refonn program include\nmaking primary education compulsory, providing  incentives such as free textbooks for  children in\nprimary  classes and stipends to  girls  enrolled  in  middle  grades; encouraging greater community\nparticipation in the delivery of quality education by reorganising and restructuring School Management\nCommittees (SMCs); carrying out regular teacher training programs; improving  salary packages for\nteachers; functionalising viable closed schools, and strengtheningp ublic-private partnerships.\n~\nFurthermore, accountability mechanisms are being strengthenedb y the introduction of a merit\nbased system for the recruitment of teachers through entry tests administered by third parties. It is also\nrehabilitating shelterless schools and providing  them with  essential infrastructure to ensure that they\nfunction as effective institutions. As a result of these interventions, there have been notable improvements\nin retention and enrolment rates, which have also been facilitated by efforts of SMCs throughout the\nprOVInce.\nSindh is responsible for financing the provision of health services and is currently in the process\nof developing a Provincial Health Strategy. The district governments have been allocated about 40% of\nthe provincial health budget to finance the Operation and Maintenance (O&M)  expenditures  of health\nfacilities, ranging from basic health units to district hospitals, although allocations for O&M  expenditures\nfor basic health units remain inadequate, and are major factors constraining the delivery of basic health\nservices.", "App~ndix 5  51\nLetter ofDevelop~t  Policy-ADB November 14, 2003\nSindhh asa  severew ater shortagep roblemw  ith the majority of its villages located in areasw ith\npolluted and brackishw  ater.

The\ndesign of DSSP is based on a basic set of reforms which will  create a conducive environment for local\ngovernments to finance the identified institutional, social, fmancial and capacity needs in service delivery\nthat are not being covered by other sources of funds.\nThe hallmark of the DSSP will  be the flexible nature of support that district governments will be\nable to accesst o fund sectoral investments based on local needsa nd priorities~ only  a \"short negative list\"\nwill  resttict the utilisation of funding by specifying activities on which the monies made available to the\nlocal governmentsw  ould not be spent.\nTheser eforms fonn an integral part of the wide-ranging\"e conomica nd social sector reforms\nlaunchedb y Sindhw  ith the supporto f a variety of multilaterala nd bilateral donors, such as the World\nBank (WE)  tlU\"oughth e Sindh Structural AdjustmentC  redit (SAC) that aims to create fiscal spacet o\nfinance priority social sector expendituresa nd complementsit  with governancer efonns critical for\nimproving delivery of basic services;t he Asian DevelopmenBt ank (ADB) thr9ugh its Decentralization\nSupport Programt hat strengthensc apacity of local governmentst;h e ADB with its Accesst o Justice\nProgram to bring about judicial  reforms and specific sectorali nvestmentst hrough ADB' s Devolved\nElementaryE ducationP roject,; the ESRA fundedb y the USAID and otherd onor assistedp rojectsi n the\nsocials ectors.\nIn the education sector, the effectiveness of programs implemented during the last three years will\nbe evaluated and wherever necessary, they will  be reinforced and strengthened.T o enhance accountability\nmechanisms and addressg overnance issues, the policy of contract based, institution  specific recruitment\nof teachers through third  parties with  adequate weightage for locals and females in the recruitment\nfonnula will  be continued.\nTo improve education perfom1ancein dicators such as enrolmentl evels and transition rates,\nincentivesb asedp rogramss uch as the distribution of free textbooksa nd stipendsw  ill be supporteda nd\nfurther strengthenedto  enhancet heir efficacy in the system.T he scopeo f the on-going program of\nstipendsf or girls enrolled in elementaryg radesw  ould be extendedt o cover girls enrolled in secondary\nFinance DeDartmcnt.

Sector Financing \n \n1.  Sindh Economy. Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) was about PRs3.73 billion \n($63.7 billion equivalent) in FY2002. Sindh\u2019s economy contributes 30% of the GDP compared to \na population share of about 25%, the difference being explained by the economic hub of \nKarachi. Half of Sindh\u2019s population live in the urban areas. The per capita income is about $450 \nper person per year. Poverty has increased from 27% in FY1999 to 37% in 2001. About one \nthird of the urban and two thirds of the rural population are poor, living on less than a dollar a \nday.  \n \n2.  Sindh Revenue. The budget of the Sindh provincial government (SPG) was PRs80.7 \nbillion  ($1.4 billion) in FY2003, or 7.2% of the provincial GDP, to serve the economy of \napproximately 35 million people. The budget includes 82% federal transfers (taxes and nontax \ntransfers), 16% provincial revenue receipts, and 2% development grants. Federal transfers have \non average increased 17.6% since FY1998, compared with an  annual growth of 12.7% for \nprovincial receipts. The level of development grants has not been constant in the last 6 years; \nthe amount was close to zero in FY2000 but was PRs4.2 billion ($72 million) in FY2002 (Table \nA6.1). \n \n3.  Public Sector Budget. The total budget for FY2003 was PRs99.3 billion, including 94% \nrecurrent expenditures and 6% development expenditures, including the annual development \nprogram and  foreign project assistance. The recurrent expenditure in these social sectors \nincreased at an average annual growth rate of 16.7% in the past 6 years, exceeding receipts in \nthe last 6 years. Contrary to recurrent spending, development  spending decreased between \nFY1998 and FY2001 due to a decline in foreign project assistance, but recovered from FY2002 \nonward. The total fiscal deficit in FY2003 was PRs18.7 billion (about $322 million). Before  \nFY2001, SPG replaced federal loans with domestic borrowing. But in view of high interest rates \nnow, SPG wants to replace domestic loans with foreign borrowing. In FY2003, SPG reduced \ndomestic loans to 52% and used foreign loans for the remaining 48%. SPG had a total debt of \nPRs109.6 billion (about $2 billion) in FY2001, of which 59% was foreign, 39% federal, and 2% \ndomestic. The revenues are expected to increase by 22% in FY2005, and by 11% in the \nfollowing years.      \n \n4.  Social Sector Budget.  The recurrent budget for major social services (education, \nhealth, and water and sanitation) was 29%, compared with general administration 22%, and \ndebt servicing 14% in FY2002. The budgets for education, health and water and sanitation are \nrespectively, 73%, 24%, and 3% of total spending in the major social sectors in FY2003 (Table \nA6.2) The budget in the water and sanitation sector is currently at an all-time low.

Overall, the total social sector budget (both revenue and development expenditures) has \nincreased by 11.0% per year. Between FY2000 and FY2003, social sector recurrent budgets \nhave increased by 11.4% per year on average (10.7% for education, 13.5% for health, and \n12.5% for [WSS]).

Targets  \n \n6.  As the policy matrix indicates (Appendix 5), SPG commits to maintain a 30% share for \nsocial services, irrespective of the annual budget growth. The National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy sets a target of at least 15% increase in social sector spending per year. The increase \nin Sindh social sector spending is proposed to go up by respectively  28%, 11% and  11%, \nimplying an average annual growth of 16%. The Government share will increase by 22% in the \nfirst year and 11% in the second and third year according to its expected growth without \nprogram support. The targets are based on a range of considerations including (i) the relative \ncushion in the salary budget due to unfilled vacancies, (ii) the federal decision to increase staff \nsalaries, and (iii) relatively low nonsalary and development budgets, and overall low spending in \nthe WSS sector. Tables A6.3 and A6.4 provided the rates and amounts for the relative growth of \nthe social sectors in salary, nonsalary recurrent and development expenditures, balanced in a \nmanner that should result in a more balanced social sector budget. The salary component is \nkept relatively low, while nonsalary recurrent and development spending is expected to increase ", "          Appendix 6  57\nmore sharply, particularly the WSS. The result would be half of the incremental budget flowing \ninto education, and one quarter each into health and WSS. \n \n7.  The proposed Program will add additional costs to carry out the policy reforms, including \nopening and rehabilitation of schools, health centers and water supply and sanitation schemes, \nhiring female teachers and paramedics, stipends and textbooks for school children, and up-front \nfunding of community-based organizations.

These committees are not yet fully operational, and the DSSP and DSP can combine \nresources to make them effective, active coordination units. \n \nCouncils  The councils at both the DG and TMA levels have the dual roles of approving the budgets and \n  also monitoring the working of the LG through a number of committees. The DSSP will support \nthe strengthening of the council and its committees as outlined above.   \n   ", "62 Appendix 7 \n \n3. Community Arrangements \nCommunity- Following the ethos expressed in the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, which aims at \nbased  improving the breadth and width of civil society engagement with the public sector, the DSSP \norganizations  seeks to strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs), by encouraging\u2014\nas a policy action\u2014the active involvement of CBOs in improving the delivery of social services \nthrough  public-private  partnerships.  The  term  CBO  is  used  broadly  to  include  school \nmanagement committees (SMCs), health boards and patients associations, village development \nassociations (VDAs) for water and sanitation, citizen community boards (CCBs), NGOs, welfare \norganizations, and other representative bodies that are based in the community and/or represent \nand articulate the specific needs, concerns, and priorities of communities. CBO services may be \n(i) building the capacity to assume responsibility,  (ii) managing social services, (iii) providing  \nsocial services, (iv) performing oversight functions, or (v) a combination (i)-(iv). The councils at \nboth the DG and TMA levels have the dual roles of approving the budgets and monitoring the \nworking of the LG through a number of committees. Funding of CBOs will be subject to yearly \napproval of the annual plans, and availability of funds in competition with other CBOs. The DSSP \nwill support the strengthening of the CBOs, council, and committees as outlined below along with \nthe DSP.   \n \nCitizen  As envisaged under the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, the CCBs are to be established in \ncommunity  the LGs to mobilize  the community for development and improvement in service delivery; \nboards  development and management of a new or existing public facility; identification of development \nand  municipal  needs;  mobilization  of  stakeholders  for  community  involvement  in  the \nimprovement and maintenance of facilities; welfare of the handicapped, destitute, widows, and \nfamilies in extreme poverty; establishment of farming, marketing, and consumers cooperatives.  \nDSSP seeks to reinforce this mandate and encourages the formation of CCBs and their \nactivation by engaging them in development activity in the social sectors.  \n \nSchool  SMCs have been provided a number of powers and responsibilities by the government of Sindh, \nmanagement  aimed  at  increasing  the  participation  of  communities  to  improve  school  operation  and \ncommittees  maintenance, including purchase of textbooks and school supplies, repairs and maintenance, \n(SMCs)  providing basic facilities and furniture, and contracting female teachers on site-specific contracts. \n  The DSSP will expand the current SMC funding coverage to all schools up to grade 12 if no other \n  financing is available to them. The funds will be allocated according to the formula used by the \nprovincial government\u2014at the moment PRs167 per child\u2014and be deposited in their accounts by \nthe DG. Use of these funds will be subject to the instructions and guidelines issued by the \ngovernment of Sindh from time to time. Proper accounts of the funds will be maintained by the \nSMCs and will be subject to audit. \n \nHealth boards  As with SMCs, health boards and patients welfare associations can play an important role in \nand patients  improving basic amenities and services at health facilities. They may help through maintenance \nwelfare  and repairs, provision of utilities, procurement of essential equipment and supplies, and provision \nassociations  of  incentives  and  facilities  for  female  staff.  Through  health  boards  and  patients  welfare \n    associations,  health  facilities  will  be  encouraged  to  become  financially  more  self-sufficient \n  through a transparent and pro-poor system of user charges, whereby the earnings may be used \n  for repairs and maintenance of the health facility and other such necessary expenditure. The \nhealth boards and patients welfare associations will need to advertise the fee structures so as to \ntake the clientele into confidence and also to ensure that there is transparency and accountability \nin the process. The health boards will maintain proper accounts subject to audit. \n \nVillage  Village development associations (VDAs) were established to take over water schemes in the \ndevelopment  rural  areas  and  operate  them,  but  this  initiative  has  experienced  difficulties  because  (i) \nassociations  overdesigned mechanized schemes became unmanageable after the Government withdrew its \nfinancial support; and (ii) the frameworks for operations of VDAs (such as fee collection and \ncapacity to maintain records, etc.) themselves were unclear. Under the DSSP, an effort will be \nmade to revive the VDAs and to involve them in not only identifying viable schemes, but in \ndeveloping the frameworks that will enable them to generate and use revenues for maintenance \nof schemes. VDAs will be eligible to receive funds from the share of the TMAs earmarked for \nsupporting CBOs and the criteria for eligibility will be developed by Finance Department and the \nPSU.  VDAs  will  need  to  maintain  proper  accounts  of  the  funds.  The  PSU  and  LSUs,  in \ncollaboration with the DSP, will undertake initiatives to build the administrative and financial \ncapacities of VDAs.  \nSource: Sindh Provincial Government  \n   ", "          Appendix 8  63\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  In the wake of the devolution, a provincial finance commission (PFC) was established \nwith a view to providing an institutional arrangement for designing transfer mechanisms for flow \nof funds to the local governments. The PFC has announced an interim award, that has met the \napproval of all stakeholders, and is currently working on improving the design for a final award. \nThe  description  of  the  use  of  funds  is  divided  into  five  areas:  allocation,  transfer,  use, \naccountability, and sustainability.  \n \nB.  Allocation of Funds \n \n2.  The  simplest  and  most  relevant  for  the  purpose  of  the  Devolved  Social  Services \nProgram (DSSP) is the method used to transfer funds to local governments from the Khushal \nPakistan Program (a poverty reduction initiative of the federal Government), which distributes \nfunds based on population (70%) and backwardness (30%). The population data is sourced \nfrom the population census carried out by the federal Government in 1998, while backwardness \nis sourced from the deprivation index generated by the Social Policy and Development Center, \nranking districts in Sindh on the basis of 26 socioeconomic indicators. The DSSP funds are \nproposed to be divided as follows: education (50%), health (20%), and water and sanitation \n(30%). To ensure that there is a definite role for civil society organizations, at least 25% of total \nfunds  will  be  earmarked  for  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  such  as  school \nmanagement  committees,  village  development  associations  and  health  boards,  and \nnongovernment  organizations.    During  the  first  year,  funds  are  not  proposed  for  union \nadministrations, but distribution to them may be considered from the second year onward.  \n \nC.  Transfer of Funds \n \n3.  The entire share of the district governments for education and health, and that of \ntaluka(subdistricts)/town municipal administration (TMA) for water and sanitation will flow from \nthe provincial government to the district fund and the taluka fund directly from Account no. IV \nwithin an agreed-upon timeframe. The transfer will be subject to the local government (LG) \nconcerned signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the provincial government, \nagreeing to a set of conditions under which the funds can be used. These terms and conditions \nwill include minimum standards, ineligibility lists, and reporting requirements for the use of \nfunds. This direct transfer mechanism will create much-needed fiscal space and improve cash \nflow  for  run-down  social  services  within  LGs;  strengthen  local  ownership,  autonomy,  and \naccountability; and reduce the risk of using fungible foreign aid funds for other purposes.  \n \nD.  Use of Funds  \n \n4.  One of the principal features of the DSSP is the flexibility it provides in use of funds. This \nflexibility is being proposed in the light of experience with approaches that are prescriptive and \nbecause this proposal confirms the autonomous role of LGs. Program funds are subject to few \nsafeguards for accountable, responsible use. To become eligible for program funds, all LGs will \nhave to sign an MOU with the provincial government or any agency authorized by it. The MOU \nwill follow the general terms and conditions for use of funds, a negative list of ineligible items, \nand a minimal positive list. The general eligibility criteria of funding for annual plans of DGs and \nTMAs are as follows: \n ", "    Appendix 9   65\n(i)  Use a participatory planning process including representation of women. \n(ii)  Present the annual sector plan and budget for all sources and uses of funds in \nthe sector. \n(iii)  Focus on poverty and gender, specifying inputs and outputs targets. \n(iv)  Provide implementation responsibilities and monitoring arrangements. \n(v)  Earmark 25% of the funds for CBOs and other partnership initiatives. \n(vi)  Include the minimum package of services for the sector. \n(vii)  Exclude ineligibility services. \n(viii)  Provide for accounting details to permit tracking of funds. \n(ix)  Ensure adequate financial management capacity and agree to audit. \n \n5.  The program funds will form part of the district or taluka fund and the accounting \nprocedures  prescribed  by  the  Government  will  be  followed.  To  permit  tracking  of  funds, \nhowever, separate statements of expenditures will be prepared and submitted monthly to the \nprogram management unit. Expenditures made with program funds will also be subject to \nexternal audit as per procedure agreed-upon with the Sindh provincial government (SPG).  \n \n6.  All procurements, whether for goods or services and including those made from the \nprogram funds, will follow existing government rules and procedures, the provisions of the \nprocurement manual and/or any other rules/regulations governing procurement at the LG level.  \n \nE.  Accountability \n \n7.  The flexibility in use of funds that is being proposed under the DSSP calls for sufficient \nsafeguards against misuse of funds and abuse of the flexible approach. For example, (i) the \nMOU will set out the plans; (ii) there will be participatory planning and monitoring, integration of \nthe program with the normal planning and budgeting process in local governments, monitoring \nand  evaluation  through  various  committees,  performance  standards  and  benchmarks,  and \nmeasures to ensure transparency and public information.  A disincentive for deviant behavior is \nproposed to be built in withholding further releases to the deviant local government in the year \nthat follows.  \n \nF.  Sustainability  \n \n8.  To provide sustenance to this initiative of supporting SPG to improve its fiscal space and \nincrease  investments  in  the  social  sectors,  SPG  will  need  to  (i)  prepare  a  medium-term \nbudgetary framework based on a realistic estimate of the sources of funds, and (ii) demonstrate \na level of political commitment and provide adequate assurances on the policy actions required \nto enable the program funds to have a meaningful impact on social services by institutionalizing \nprocesses for accountable use of these funds. The financial plan in Appendix 6 shows how the \nDSSP is expected to contribute to social sector spending.    \n \n9.  The DSSP also has a technical assistance (TA) loan for building the capacity of the \nsocial sector. This component has a separate fund managed by the program support unit. It is \nproposed that the TA funds follow the same approval mechanisms that are being used for TA \ninvestments under the Decentralization Support Program.  \n \n \n \n           ", "66   Appendix 10 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n($\u2019000) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Yes  Sector identified as a national priority in  Yes \npoverty analysis?    country poverty partnership agreement?   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan (Sindh Province): \nAbout half of Sindh\u2019s population of 35 million live in urban areas, with the majority of them concentrated in the main \ncities of Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur. Sindh has the highest concentration of the poor in Pakistan with the figure \nincreasing from 27% in 1999 to 37% in 2001. Two thirds of the poor live in rural areas. Poverty; gender imbalance; \nweak management; and poor service delivery in education, health, and water supply have contributed to high mortality \nand malnutrition rates, stagnating school enrollment and high population growth in Sindh. \n \nThe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and program calls for major reforms in public sector governance, and \nincreased allocation and efforts for improving social services. The Sindh provincial government (SPG) has prepared a \npoverty reduction strategy and wants to strengthen devolution in the social sectors. The devolution is under way since \nAugust  2001.  Local  governments  (LGs)  are  functioning  at  the  district,  taluka,  and  union  level.  As  per  Local \nGovernment Ordinance, district governments have been given responsibility for basic education and health services, \nand taluka municipal administrations for water and sanitation services. The devolution policy anticipates that the LG \nstructure will improve the efficiency of allocating public resources in accordance with local needs, and enhance quality, \nefficiency, accountability, and ownership of such services.  \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement between the Government of Pakistan and Asian Development Bank (ADB) reflects \nthe Government\u2019s vision for poverty reduction, including the need for improving social services for the poor. The major \ntheme of ADB\u2019s country strategy program is governance reform including in the social sector. ADB supports the \nGovernment\u2019s governance reforms through the Decentralization Support Program and other programs. The proposed \nSindh Devolved Social Services Program  (DSSP) supports the Sindh Reform Program, the Poverty Reduction \nStrategy and the devolution to LGs in the social sectors.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nAbout one third of Sindh\u2019s population live on less than a dollar a day, about two thirds of them in rural areas, with \npockets of extreme poverty. Sindh faces lack of basic services, high incidence of health problems, low literacy rate, \nhigh population growth, lack of rule of law, lack of access to justice and empowerment, inaccessibility of capital, \nincreased unemployment, and weak service delivery. Social sector indicators in Sindh are very poor. Half of the \nchildren below age of 5 years are malnourished, and 11% of them die before the age of 5.  Of the survivors, half do \nnot attend school. The total fertility rate is 5 children per woman. Only a quarter of the rural population have access to \nsafe drinking water. The poor social indicators are linked to complex political and social organizations, poverty, gender \ndiscrimination, run-down social services, and governance problems.        \n \nThe rural society of Sindh is heterogeneous in terms of ethnicity, tribes, and caste. Social relationships are based on \ncaste, tribe, and language. The two major rural groups are Sindhi and Baluchi. In addition, there are Punjabi, Pathan, \nBihari, and Hindu scheduled castes. The Hindu scheduled caste constitutes 6.5% of the population. The scheduled \ncaste includes Kholi, Bheel, Parkari Kulhis, Meghwar, and Khumber. Social groups found within rural areas of Sindh \ninclude landowner (zamindar) sharecroppers (Muslim and Hindu scheduled castes), small and middle farmers, wage \nlaborers, fisherfolk, artisans and service households. In addition to differences in castes there are seminomadic clans \nand, in some areas seasonal migrants and the boat people in Manchar Lake. In rural Sindh, status and power are \nconferred by land ownership. The land ownership, relationships of tribes and caste determine much of the political and \nsocial organization and functioning of the society. The skewed land tenure pattern and high degree of landlessness is \nrelated to perpetuation of the  zamindar system. The skewed land tenure pattern, very low rainfall and periodic \ndroughts, and salination of lands have seriously affected agricultural output, and are contributing to deep rural poverty \nand migration to urban areas at the rate of 6% per year.    \n \nDuring the past decade, Sindh implemented the Social Action Program (SAP) to improve the social sector. The SAP \nexperience has mixed outcome. The interrelated economic, governance, and project modalities affected SAP effort. \nReforms in service delivery will be needed to improve the performance of the public sector to meet the Millennium ", "Appendix 12  69\nDevelopment Goals. The proposed DSSP will support capacity building, policy reforms, and flexible financing for \ndevolved social services. The DSSP aims to improve people\u2019s access to education, health, water and sanitation in \nSindh and thereby help reduce poverty and gender imbalance. The DSSP will specifically focus on (i) building the \ncapacity of LGs, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and community-based organizations (CBOs) to have timely \nand flexible funding modalities to improve the quality of social services; (ii) improve technical capacity, participatory \nplanning process, accountability and transparency of LGs, NGOs, CBOs; (iii) community outreach and social \nmobilization activities by LGs, NGOs, and CBOs to ensure access to social services by the poor, scheduled caste, and \nwomen; (iv) developing mechanisms for collaboration and partnership among LGs, NGOs, and  for cost sharing, and \nsustained service delivery; (v) developing committees/working groups at the ward level (local bodies) representing \ndifferent  socioeconomic  groups,  women  for  planning  of  social  services  in  local  level;  (vi) strengthen school \nmanagement committees through increased involvement of parents, specifically mothers, in monitoring quality of \neducation and school enrollment; and (vii) developing mechanism for community level monitoring of LGs and sectoral \nagencies providing social services and fund management. The DSSP will encourage CBOs to negotiate and mobilize \nthe landlords in the respective villages to provide the sharecroppers with access to social services planned under the \nDSSP. The DSSP will support LGs to develop strategies to target particularly vulnerable populations, and track \nbenefits for the different ethnic and socioeconomic groups.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis: A cross section of stakeholders, which includes, members of Sindh assembly, councilors, \ngovernment officials, representatives from all tiers of LGs, NGOs, CBOs, media, and members of civil society from 16 \ndistricts participated in three workshops. The proposed DSSP components were discussed and recommendations \nwere  made  related  to  finance  and  governance,  education,  health,  water  and  sanitation,  public  and  private \npartnerships, and gender issues.    \nParticipation strategy: The reforms and capacity building for LGs, NGOs, and CBOs will strengthen the capacity of \nthese institutions for community outreach and secure the active involvement of different social and economic groups, \nscheduled caste, especially poor and women in local-level planning and monitoring of social services in their \nrespective communities. The public and private partnerships, formation of working groups at the ward level and local-\nlevel monitoring will enhance local ownership, participation of different social groups, scheduled caste, the poor and \nwomen in improving access to social services. \n \nD.  Gender Strategy \nIn particular in rural Sindh, but also in urban areas, the majority of women continue to be restricted in mobility, \ndiscriminated against, exploited, and denied access to economic resources and assets. The health and social \ndevelopment indicators for women are poor compared with those of men. The literacy rate is 40% for males and 13% \nfor females over 10 years of age in rural areas. Infant mortality rate for female infants is 105 per 1,000 live births \ncompared with 93 per 1,000 live births for male infants. The Devolved Social Services Program (DSSP) will follow the \nGender Reform Action Plan to provide leadership and labor opportunities to women, and address and monitor social \nconstraints related to social service delivery for women, especially poor women.   \n \nThe recent Local Government Ordinance introduced 33% of reserve seats for women in local governments.
