A technical assistance (TA) is required to conduct due diligence on the proposed loan \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and support implementation of the subprojects to be \nsupported through the loan and Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant administered by ADB. \nPhase 1 of the TA will conduct project due diligence covering technical, economic, financial, \nprocurement, and social and environmental safeguards. Phase 2 will provide implementation \nand capacity development support, including individual subproject preparation, assessment of \nbenefits and scope for expansion, and will also explore potential new business lines for Energy \nEfficiency Services Limited (EESL). A separate evaluation of the impact of subprojects will also \nbe conducted.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The  outputs  of  Phase  1  of  the  TA  are  a  fully  prepared  loan  and  grant,  including \ncompleted social and environmental analysis, technical, economic and financial due diligence. \n \n3.  The major outputs and activities from Phase 1 of the TA are summarized in Table A3.1.  \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities of TA Phase 1 \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \n1.

The  outputs  of  Phase  2  of  the  TA  are  additional  fully  prepared  subprojects  and \nevaluation of potential new business lines for EESL. For each subproject, the  preparation \nprocess will include (i) energy audits: top down analysis and unit sampling; (ii) energy savings \npotential: identification of appropriate efficient technology and estimated savings from efficient \ntechnology  deployment;  (iii)  demonstration  of  energy  savings:  deployment  of  efficient \ntechnology to verify energy savings potential; (iv) financial analysis: estimated cost savings, \nfinancial capacity of the distribution utilities, and development of funds flow arrangement; and \n(v)  benefits  analysis:  evaluation  of  the  impacts  to  various  stakeholder  groups.  A  gender \nspecialist will work with the team preparing the subprojects to maximize gender benefits, and \ndevelop and implement women-targeted interventions. The potential for new business lines will \ninvolve (i) participation in international training and workshops to discuss international best \npractice  and  new  opportunity  areas  for  EESL;  (ii)  energy  evaluation  to  identify  major  use \ncategories and opportunities for efficiency improvements; (iii) technology evaluation to include \navailability in India and cost-effectiveness; (iv) outreach to consumers to build awareness and \nassess technology suitability and consumer acceptance; (v) demonstration of technology, if \nappropriate, along with energy savings realized; and (vi) evaluation of the potential to deploy \ntechnology at relevant spatial scale (municipality, state, and/or country level).  \n ", " \n5.
