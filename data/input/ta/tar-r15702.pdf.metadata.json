INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  with  cofinanciers  Danish  International \nDevelopment Assistance (Danida) and International Life Sciences Institute, have been carrying \nout a regional study1 with six developing member countries (DMCs)\u2014People\u2019s Republic of \nChina,  India,  Indonesia,  Pakistan,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam\u2014on  building  capacity  to  fortify \nessential foods that will benefit human health and nutrition, especially among the poor. The \nstudy has focused on building partnerships between the public and private sectors to enrich \nnutrition by improving consumer choice in the marketplace. The objective is to improve human \nnutrition by strengthening industrial policy and the role of the private sector in enhancing an \naffordable and high quality diet for the poor. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) aims to (i) identify regional issues and actions required to \naccelerate production of micronutrient-fortified foods; (ii) support regional dialogue on issues \nrelated  to  food  standards,  regulations,  trade,  and  surveillance;  (iii) create  a  framework  for \nregional  fortification  of  certain  essential  staples  (salt,  wheat  flour,  cooking  oil,  and \ncomplementary foods); (iv) develop a comprehensive social marketing and communications \nplan  for  (iii);  (v)  link  fortification  policies  and  programs  to  poverty  reduction  and  human \ndevelopment in the region; and (vi) develop country investment plans (CIPs) for the participating \nDMCs. Fortification of staple foods directly supports poverty reduction and raises the quality of \nhuman capital, both key ADB objectives. \n \n3.  The  project  has  proceeded  along  two  directions:  first,  regional  workshops  on  food \nfortification  technology  for  the  four  food  vehicles,  and  designing  of  structural  reforms  in \nregulation, trade, quality assurance systems, and nutrition surveillance, all necessary to ensure \nthat domestically and internationally traded food products will be safe and efficacious; second, \ntraining of contracted DMC country research institutes to prepare their CIPs based on guidelines \nand  spreadsheets  that  will  guide  resource  mobilization  once  the  plans  are  accepted  by \ngovernments. The DMCs were carefully chosen because they had demonstrated the need and \ncapacity for reform and to absorb appropriate levels of investment.  \n \nIII.  CHANGES IN SCOPE AND AMOUNT \n \nA.   Change in Scope \n \n4.  As the study has proceeded, the DMCs, ADB, and the cofinanciers have reached two \nconclusions that will require expansion of the TA scope. First, the country research institutes \nunder contract to prepare the CIPs have requested ADB to support additional consultants\u2019 \ninputs (from already contracted consultants) to strengthen the quality and credibility of the plans, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for a Regional Initiative to Eliminate Micronutrient Malnutrition through Public-\nPrivate Partnership (TA 5944-REG). Manila. ", "2   \nand to collect and analyze data related to food consumption patterns of the poor targeted in the \nCIPs. The additional consultant time, amounting to 20 person-days, will be advisory support to \ncountry research institutions, and will not involve additional travel and per diem. Additional data \ncollection on the consumption patterns of the at-risk group will add resources to each CIP \nsubcontract. Second, ADB and the DMCs believe the project has created a strong opportunity to \nlink the CIPs to regional resource mobilization for nutrition improvement of the poor. Private \nphilanthropies, like the Gates Foundation, have expressed interest in working with ADB to \ncofinance CIPs and to manage the implementation of the donors\u2019 financing contribution to the \nCIPs. Accordingly, an investors\u2019 roundtable (at ADB headquarters) will be supported under the \nsupplementary grant to attract stakeholders in the financial community (multilaterals, bilaterals, \ninternational nongovernmental organizations, and philanthropic foundations). A key stakeholder \nwill  be  the  Global  Alliance  to  Improve  Nutrition,  a  coalition  of  funders  led  by  the  Gates \nFoundation but including bilaterals like the Canadian International Development Agency and the \nUnited States Agency for International Development. The roundtable will assemble resource \ncommitments from donor clusters willing to work in partnership with each country, and will agree \non planning for 2003\u20132005. Third, prior to the investors\u2019 roundtable, an intensive CIP review \nmeeting will be scheduled in Beijing, hosted by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, to ensure the plans meet ADB guidelines and standards of excellence for referral to the \ninternational financial community. These three activities will elevate the regional study to a high-\nprofile  event  accentuating  the  public-private  donor  partnerships  to  meet  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals regarding mortality and hunger reduction, and enhanced educability.   \n \nB.   Change in Amount \n \n5.  The  TA  amount  is  increased  by  $200,000,  from  $1.3  million  to  $1.5  million,  to  be \nprovided  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  Special  Fund.  ADB\u2019s  Knowledge \nManagement  Committee  endorsed  this  proposal  on  14  June  2002.  A  cost  estimate  and \nfinancing plan for the additional TA activities is included in the Appendix. \n \n6.  The  Keystone  Center  (TKC-USA),  the  firm  contracted  under  the  TA,  will  provide \nconsultant assistance for the regional workshops and CIP preparation and review, and will \nmanage  the  additional  resources.  TKC-USA  will  execute  subcontract  variations  with  each \ncountry research institution to add funds for collecting and analyzing food consumption data. TA \nimplementation will be completed by 31 March 2003.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n7.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the         \nchange in scope of the technical assistance for the Regional Initiative to Eliminate Micronutrient \nMalnutrition in Asia through Public-Private Partnership, as described in para. 5; and (ii) the \nprovision of additional technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the \nequivalent of $200,000 for the Regional Initiative to Eliminate Micronutrient Malnutrition in Asia \nthrough Public-Private Partnership, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
