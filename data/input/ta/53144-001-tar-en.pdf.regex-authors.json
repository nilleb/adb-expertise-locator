The Rural Enterprise Financing Project will increase incomes of subsistence small farmers \nby helping them engage in rural enterprises. Through Small Farmers Development Bank (SFDB) \n(the financial intermediary) and SFDB\u2019s member small farmers agriculture cooperatives (SFACs), \nthe project will finance rural enterprises comprising (i) collective enterprises that are jointly owned \nand operated by small farmers, and (ii) individual enterprises.1 The project will also improve the \nfinancial  intermediary\u2019s  rural  enterprise  financing  capacity  as  well  as  provide  value  chain \ndevelopment and business facilitation support for small farmers, especially women. \n \n2.  The project is aligned with the following impact: employment-oriented economic activities \nincreased.2 The project will have the following outcome: small farmers\u2019 engagement in rural \nenterprises increased. The project has three outputs: (i) collective enterprises developed and \nfinanced, (ii) individual enterprises promoted and financed, and (iii) rural enterprise financing \ncapacity enhanced. The project will be financed with $50 million loan from the concessional \nordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Although Nepal has made notable socioeconomic progress since 1995, poverty is still \nrampant in rural areas. Of Nepal\u2019s total population of 29 million, 23 million (81%) live in rural areas; \nof this rural population, an estimated 6 million (27.4%) live below the poverty line.3 Nepal\u2019s rural \npoverty is largely due to the limited gainful employment opportunities. In rural Nepal, agriculture \nis the main source of livelihood. However, the agriculture sector is largely subsistence in nature \nand  confined  to  primary  production  of  crops  and  livestock  with  little  value  addition  and \ncommercialization. The average landholding per household is 0.7 hectares and the majority \n(51.6%) of farm households have landholding of less than 0.5 hectares.4 In terms of per capita \nconsumption, the average Nepali spent NRs80,807 in 2017; during the same year, the average \nurban consumption was NRs103,146 and the average rural consumption was NRs64,701.5 The \nearnings from agriculture activities are hardly enough for rural households to move out of poverty. \n \n4.  To reduce rural poverty, it is necessary to shift from current subsistence production to \nvalue-adding rural enterprises. A value chain in agriculture is a set of activities that adds value to \ncommodities  and  links  primary  producers  to  processers,  traders,  merchants  with  storage, \ntransport, processing, packing, marketing, and financing. To add value to their primary production, \nsome households have started value chain enterprises or rural enterprises, both on-farm and off-\nfarm, such as commercial crop production and processing of agricultural produce.6 However, rural \nenterprise development is hampered because of insufficient business facilitation and limited rural \n                                                \n1  Sana Kisan Bikas Laghubitta Bittiyasanstha Ltd or commonly called SFDB. \n2  Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2017. 14th Three-Year Development Plan, FY2017\u2013FY2019. \nKathmandu. \n3  Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission, Central Bureau of Statistics. 2011.

Off-farm enterprises encompass all types \nof economic activities other than subsistence production and on-farm enterprises. ", "2   \nenterprise financing. Developing rural enterprises in Nepal requires various support, including \nbusiness facilitation, capacity building, and financing. \n \n5.  For rural enterprise financing, microfinance institutions (MFIs) can be a major source of \nfinance because of their strong presence in rural areas and their long association with rural \ncommunities. However, MFIs face various challenges in enterprise financing, including (i) a \nregulatory ceiling on MFIs\u2019 loans of NRs1 million, (ii) MFIs\u2019 limited sources of funding, and (iii) \nMFIs\u2019 limited knowledge and capacity in rural enterprise financing. To address rural enterprises\u2019 \nfinancing and capacity constraints, the project will provide loans to rural enterprises through \nSFDB, an apex cooperative bank, and its member SFACs. In addition to financing, SFDB will \nextend value chain development and business facilitation support to SFACs and their members \nto promote investment-ready rural enterprises. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  The attached technical assistance (TA) will support SFDB and SFACs to enhance their \ncapacity in rural enterprise financing and extend rural enterprise value chain development and \nbusiness facilitation support.
