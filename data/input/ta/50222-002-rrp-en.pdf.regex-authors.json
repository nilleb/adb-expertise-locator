THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Chongqing  Innovation  and  Human  Capital \nDevelopment Project. \n \n2.   The project will (i) help the people in Chongqing gain industry-relevant and innovation-\noriented skills and capacities for employment; and (ii) support institutions to create an enabling \nand inclusive environment that helps build an innovative, diversified, efficient, and green economy \nin Chongqing. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Chongqing is a centrally administered municipality in the Chengdu\u2013Chongqing city cluster \nat the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.1 The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) is one of \nthe key economic growth engines in the PRC. Its nine provinces and two specially administered \nmunicipalities  account for  more than  40%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  population,  40%  of  its freshwater \nresources, and about 45% of its economic output. While the YREB, particularly in the eastern \ndelta area, has benefited from extensive development since the late 1980s, economic growth in \nthe middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin lags behind that of the coastal areas \nand is below its potential. These parts of the YREB still face significant development challenges, \nincluding slow economic diversification. The YREB faces a growing imbalance between economic \nachievement and environmental quality. \n \n4.  Chongqing covers a land area of 82,400 square kilometers and has a population of more \nthan 30 million, of which about 11 million are rural residents. Although Chongqing\u2019s per capita \ngross domestic product (GDP) was slightly above the national average in 2017, it was about half \nto two-thirds that of the YREB eastern delta area.2 Chongqing was developed as one of the main \nindustrial bases of the inland PRC. About 44% of Chongqing\u2019s GDP is derived from the secondary \nindustry, and the share of heavy industries (such as iron and steel, automotive, manufacturing, \nconstruction, and chemical industries) in the economy is high.3 Its resource-based, inefficient \neconomy is impacting the environment. Chongqing\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP \nwere estimated to be 7.8 tons, compared with Shanghai\u2019s 4.0 tons or Beijing\u2019s 3.5 tons.4 \n \n5.  Chongqing\u2019s per capita disposable income for both urban and rural residents was below \nthe national average in 2017.5 The gap in income growth and industrial development between \nChongqing and the PRC\u2019s eastern coastal cities led to a massive population out-migration from \nChongqing and caused severe social and economic problems; given the scarcity of matching local \n \n1  The lower reaches include provinces or municipalities of Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang; the middle reaches \ninclude Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi; and the upper reaches include Chongqing, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan. \n2  Government of the PRC, National Bureau of Statistics. 2018. China Statistical Yearbook 2018. Beijing. The per capita \nGDP of Chongqing in 2017 was CNY63,442, compared with the national average (CNY59,660), Shanghai\u2019s \n(CNY126,634), Jiangsu\u2019s (CNY107,150), and Zhejiang\u2019s (CNY92,057). Within Chongqing, urban\u2013rural disparities \nexist and the per capita GDPs of 25 of the municipality\u2019s 38 districts and counties were below the national average. \n3  Chongqing Municipal Government (CMG). 2018. Chongqing Statistical Yearbook 2018. Chongqing. \n4  World Bank. 2019. Chongqing 2035: Spatial and Economic Transformation for a Global City\u2013Overview. Washington, \nDC. \n5  Footnote 2. The per capita disposable income of Chongqing in 2017 was CNY24,153, compared with the national \naverage of CNY25,974. In 2017, the per capita disposable income of urban residents was CNY32,193 in Chongqing \nand CNY36,396 in the PRC, and that of rural residents was CNY12,638 in Chongqing and CNY13,432 in the PRC. \n ", "2 \njobs in Chongqing, about 4.82 million people from Chongqing left their hometowns and families \nto seek work in the coastal cities or outside of Chongqing in 2017.6 The Chongqing Municipal \nGovernment (CMG) is under immense pressure and has issued policies and directives to support \nthe  migrant  workers  to  return  to  their  hometown  in  Chongqing  for  employment  and \nentrepreneurship. However, the support mechanisms are still at the pilot stage and Chongqing \nlacks the capacity in facilitating the integration of returning migrants into the labor market and \nenhancing their access to public and social services. \n \n6.  Chongqing maintained more than 10% economic growth since 2002; however, it slowed \nto 9.3% in 2017 and further to 6.5% in 2018 because of the decline in the manufacturing and \nconstruction industries and insufficient capacity and human capital needed to transform from a \ntraditional to an innovative economy. The CMG prioritizes innovation in promoting sustainable \ndevelopment to shift from heavily polluting industries to innovation-driven industries across all \neconomic sectors.7 It aims to (i) develop intelligent and big data-related industries as the core for \ninnovation-driven development; (ii) promote key emerging industries such as digital information, \nintelligent manufacturing, and alternative energy; and (iii) modernize traditional pillar industries \nand service industries. However, the skills mismatch between the local human resource supply \nand industry\u2019s demand prevails because of a lack of relevant education and training. Among \nuniversity or college graduates from Chongqing, only about 65% find employment in Chongqing, \nwith the others mainly finding jobs in the eastern PRC. The economy and industries of Chongqing \nhave been developing through imitation or replication, but the intelligent industry has no model to \nimitate. Chongqing\u2019s innovation level was ranked 19th among 20 major PRC cities.8 \n \n7.  Chongqing  has  steadily  expanded  access  to  higher  education,  which  helps  lay  an \nessential  human  resource  foundation  for  the  development  of  the  YREB\u2019s  upper  reaches. \nHowever, Chongqing\u2019s higher education institutions (HEIs) still face financial challenges; human \nresource challenges; and modern teaching and learning challenges, including the need for \nfacilities to introduce and deliver new programs and courses aligned to evolving skills demands \nin the local economy.9 Challenges faced by HEIs that need to be urgently addressed include the \nfollowing:  (i)  outdated  curricula  that  are  not  responsive  to  emerging  industrial  demands; \n(ii) teachers\u2019 lack of technical knowledge, especially in the field of emerging technologies, and \ntheir lack of hands-on expertise and experience needed to teach more efficiently; (iii) the absence \nof effective institution\u2013industry partnerships; (iv) the lack of modern interdisciplinary programs to \ncultivate and nurture students\u2019 creativity, especially in innovation and entrepreneurship; and \n(v) the lack of facilities needed to train or retrain new skills and to introduce innovations to \nstudents, local skilled workers, farmers, and returning migrant workers. Local skilled workers, \nfarmers, and returning migrant workers, in particular, need to continuously update their knowledge \nand gain new skills to integrate modern technologies in their jobs to improve their livelihood. \nEducation programs take many years to have an impact; there is, therefore, an urgent need to \ninvest now. \n \n6  The PRC had a large migrant worker population of 171.85 million in 2017. In the middle and upper reaches of the \nYREB, about 22% of the 389 million total population, or about 86 million laborers, left their hometowns and families \nto seek work in the coastal cities. \n7  CMG. 2016.

Report on Evaluation of China Innovation Cities, 2016\u2013\n2017. Beijing (in Chinese). \n9  As of 2018, Chongqing had 65 regular HEIs. Of these, 25 were academic-track HEIs, including application-oriented \nHEIs such as Chongqing University of Science and Technology (CUST) and Chongqing University of Education \n(CUE); and 40 were tertiary technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions, including Chongqing \nVocational Institute of Engineering (CVIE) (a national demonstration institution) and Chongqing Sanxia Vocational \nCollege (CSVC) (the only tertiary TVET institution specializing in agriculture in the YREB). \n ", "3 \n8.  Industries are striving to shift to less-polluting and efficient operations through research \nand development (R&D). However, despite high returns, there is underinvestment in long-term, \nhigh-risk R&D activities because of limited private financial resources. Public investment in R&D \nis a crucial catalyst to boosting private R&D activities, innovations, long-term productivity, and \neconomic growth. Chongqing aims to create an enabling and inclusive economic environment by \nproviding public services assistance at an early stage for R&D and start-ups. Chongqing lacks \nthe capacity to support business incubation; institution\u2013industry partnerships; mentorships for \nentrepreneurs and job seekers, including returning migrant workers; intermediary services on \nlegal, finance, or intellectual property; and spaces for networking and collaboration. \n \n9.  Women made up 48.6% of the total population in Chongqing in 2017. Female students\u2019 \nrepresentation  varies  from  16%  to  70%  in  the  project  HEIs.10 Education  patterns  remain \nsegregated  along  gender  lines,  with  women  underrepresented  in  engineering,  information \ntechnology, and science and technology studies at all educational levels and in the workforce. \nThe female entrepreneurs in the economic and technological development areas (ETDAs) in \nChangshou District and Dianjiang County account for only about 3% of all entrepreneurs in the \nETDAs in Changshou and Dianjiang. HEIs\u2019 female teachers and students lack knowledge and \nskills in innovation and entrepreneurship as well as the confidence to start their own businesses. \nThe employment rate of returning migrants who are female is about 20% lower than that of \nreturning  male  migrants.  Training  programs,  networks,  and  support  targeting  women  are \ninsufficient. There is a gender imbalance in labor division\u2014even when women start their own \nbusinesses, they are primarily responsible for child and elderly care and housework. \n \n10.  Chongqing lacks capacity to help create an enabling \u201cinnovation ecosystem\u201d where HEIs \n(teachers, students, researchers, administrators, and managers); enterprises (entrepreneurs, \nengineers,  skilled  workers,  returning  migrant  workers);  intermediary  services  (business \nincubators; and professionals on legal, tax, finance, and intellectual property); and government \n(officials, policy makers, advisors) are interconnected and transfer knowledge, ideas, human and \nfinancial capital, and policies to provide an enabling environment for innovation and create jobs \nand benefits for both men and women. People need spaces that facilitate capacity building and \nnetworking to generate new ideas to start businesses. Chongqing also needs to build institutional \ncapacity to manage the planned interdisciplinary capacity building activities. \n \n11.  Strategic fit. The PRC formulated the YREB development plan, which (i) stipulates \ninclusive green development to shift from a traditional subsector approach to a crosscutting \nintegrated approach leading to a sustainable development model; (ii) solves the challenges of \nrapid  urbanization;  and  (iii)  serves  as  a  guide  to  socioeconomic  development.11 The  plan \nenvisages the establishment of an innovative and modern industrial system in the YREB, making \nthe YREB a strategic economic region for national economic and social development by 2030. \nThe PRC also issued the YREB innovation-driven industrial transformation and upgrading plan in \n2016, which identifies obsolete industries and economic activities to be upgraded and diversified \nby YREB cities through entrepreneurial and innovative approaches.12 In this context, the Asian \n \n10 Project HEIs are selected universities and tertiary technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions, \nwhich are Chongqing Jiaotong University (CJU), CSVC, CUE, CUST, and CVIE. The ratio of female students and \nteachers in the project HEIs: 16% and 32% in CJU; 42% and 30% in CSVC; 70% and 56% in CUE; 38% and 40% in \nCUST; and 30% and 40% in CVIE, respectively. \n11 Government of the PRC. 2016.

Innovation is one of the key aspects for cities\u2019 \nincreased competitiveness and economic upgrading and growth, and cities are considered to be the hubs for \nproducing innovation. \n ", "4 \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Government of the PRC have agreed to adopt a framework \napproach  to  strategically  program  ADB\u2019s  lending  support  for  development  initiatives  in the \nYREB.13 To promote sustainable development in the upper and middle reaches of the YREB, \nADB has worked in partnership with the central and local governments under the framework \napproach  to  explore  high-quality  development  models  for  replication.  Through  technical \nassistance projects for the YREB, ADB and the government identified two locations in the upper \nreaches of the YREB\u2014Chongqing and Ziyang municipalities\u2014as suitable candidates for the \npartnership.14 These two  municipalities  are  of  different  scales  and stages  of  development, \nshowcasing the problems that many cities in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB are faced \nwith in their economic transition to a high-quality, more inclusive development path. \n \n12.  The project is aligned with five out of the seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030  by  enhancing  (i)  human  development  and  social  inclusion,  (ii)  gender  equality, \n(iii) greenhouse gas emissions reduction, (iv) public service provision, and (v) governance and \ninstitutional capacity for service delivery.15 The project is in line with ADB\u2019s (i) education sector \noperations plan by strengthening quality, inclusiveness, and relevant skills in higher education \nand contributing to filling labor market gaps; (ii) country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u2013\n2020 by supporting skills development and education; and (iii) country operations business plan \nfor the PRC, 2019\u20132021, which refers to ADB\u2019s contribution to human development to promote \ninnovation and improve service delivery, and to create an enabling environment for innovation \nand new industries to support the green transformation of the local economy.16 The project \nsupports the achievement of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals by supporting \n(i) inclusive and quality education; (ii) sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth; \n(iii) inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering of innovation; and (iv) empowerment \nof women.17 \n \n13.  Lessons. Key lessons from education projects in the PRC18 include (i) the need to \nestablish  a  supportive  environment  for  promoting  institution\u2013industry  cooperation, 19  and \n(ii) promotion of sustained ownership and leadership of schools and institutions for smooth \nimplementation of activities and ensuring sustainability. Lessons from past and ongoing ADB \nprojects in Chongqing include (i) working with the experienced Chongqing project management \noffice (CPMO) at the municipal level to coordinate implementing agencies, and (ii) delegating \n \n13 ADB.

The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable and inclusive economic \ntransformation in the YREB achieved (footnote 11). The project will have the following outcome: \nemployment opportunities and people\u2019s capacity for innovation in Chongqing strengthened.20\n15. The project will work with seven subprojects managed by seven implementing agencies \nin Chongqing\u2019s innovation ecosystem to pilot interventions.21 To support Chongqing\u2019s innovation-\ndriven economic transformation, by 2027 the project will enable 8,000 graduates, including at \nleast 25% women, to gain employment within Chongqing in strategic emerging industries, and at \nleast 600 skilled technicians, including at least 25% women, working in enterprises and R&D \ninstitutions in Changshou and Dianjiang ETDAs to gain improved skills on entrepreneurship. \nInclusiveness is the main feature of the project, as it considers vulnerable groups in society that \nare most affected in Chongqing\u2019s economic transformation, including unskilled workers, returning \nmigrants, farmers, and women. The project\u2019s activities for these groups demonstrate the key \nfeatures of an inclusive innovation ecosystem model. The project will contribute significantly to \ninstitutional strengthening and project sustainability.\n16. Output  1:  Relevance  and  quality  of  higher  education  and  vocational  training \nstrengthened.  The  project  will  educate  female  and  male  professionals  by  2026  to  have \ninnovation-oriented skills and mind-sets, and promote entrepreneurial culture in project HEIs. Five \nsubprojects with  five HEIs\u2014Chongqing  Jiaotong  University (CJU),  Chongqing  University  of \nEducation (CUE), Chongqing University of Science and Technology (CUST), Chongqing Sanxia \nVocational College (CSVC), and Chongqing Vocational Institute of Engineering (CVIE)\u2014will \ndeliver output 1 through capacity development activities and provision of equipment and facilities \nto support the activities. Capacity development activities under the five subprojects will include\n(i) developing  or  updating  courses  that  address  the  emerging  needs for  \u201cgreen skills\u201d  and\napplication of cutting-edge technologies to educate at least 30,000 students;22 (ii) developing the\nabilities of at least 1,000 teachers, including women, to reform teaching resources and deliver\nnew courses to cultivate student\u2019s industry-relevant and innovation-oriented skills; (iii) reforming\neducation to build innovative and entrepreneurial skills by creating interdisciplinary collaboration\nmechanisms within HEIs and with industries, and by encouraging students, including women, to\nparticipate in skills contests; (iv) providing lifelong learning opportunities to meet the skills and\nknowledge needs for at least 60,000 local skilled workers and farmers, including women; and\n(v) conducting programs such as knowledge exchanges and study visits. Four subprojects with\nCJU, CUST, CSVC, and CVIE will provide (i) equipment (supported by advanced technology)\nneeded  for  practical  training  and  entrepreneurial  activities  developed  under  the  capacity\ndevelopment activities; and (ii) green, human-centered, and gender-sensitive facilities at each\ncampus to provide spaces needed for practical training, R&D, teaching, and lifelong learning\nactivities  that  nurture  people\u2019s  green  and  innovation-oriented  mind-sets  and  facilitate\n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 Seven subprojects are Changshou, CJU, CSVC, CUE, CUST, CVIE, and Dianjiang subprojects.

Output  2:  Supporting  mechanisms  for  innovation  and  entrepreneurship \nestablished.  The  project  will  work  with  two  subprojects\u2014one  in  Changshou  (under  the \nmanagement of the Changshou EDTA) and one in Dianjiang (under the management of the \nDianjiang ETDA)\u2014to deliver output 2 by 2026 through capacity development activities and \nprovision  of  equipment  and  facilities  to  support  the  activities.  The  project  will  support \n(i) diversifying and modernizing Chongqing\u2019s economy into a sustainable and innovative one; \n(ii) creating job opportunities for women and men by offering demonstration testbeds to develop \nnew sustainable and competitive industries, business incubation platforms, and intermediary \nservices to transform ideas into products; and (iii) supporting local workers and returning migrants\u2019 \nneeds for skills development and support. The subprojects\u2019 capacity development activities \ninclude (i) development of two one-stop stations offering public services relating to business start-\nups, job opportunities, and social services (including for women); (ii) development and provision \nof at least eight training programs and mentorships to small- and medium-sized enterprises and \nfemale and male R&D personnel on innovation and entrepreneurship; and (iii) development and \nprovision of training and mentorships to returning migrants, including at least 200 women, on skills \ndevelopment and entrepreneurship. To support the capacity development activities, the project \nwill provide (i) equipment and facilities that will be used for R&D as well as for cooperation and \ncollaboration to operationalize new research ideas into practice; and (ii) social and public service \nareas (e.g., one-stop stations and a daycare center for children) that support the needs of workers, \nentrepreneurs, and women. The facilities will be open to the public regularly to be demonstrated \nas green and inclusive innovation hubs. \n \n18.  Output 3: Institutional and project management capacity enhanced. The project will \nprovide support by 2026 to the institutional and capacity development of the CMG, CPMO, local \ngovernments, and implementing agencies, including women, to (i) perform high-quality project \nmanagement, monitoring, and reporting activities following ADB procedures and guidelines; \n(ii) ensure  the  quality  of  facilities\u2019  design,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance; \n(iii) enhance  project  management  knowledge  and  skills  on  innovation  and  entrepreneurial \nactivities in HEIs and ETDAs by participating in training and domestic and overseas study visits; \nand (iv) pilot green and human-centered facilities on HEI campuses and in ETDAs. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  The government\u2019s initial proposal for industrial transformation has been a conventional \nconstruction-based  approach.  ADB  had  numerous  consultations  with  the  CMG  and  local \ngovernments to encourage them to think differently to tackle their development needs, helping \nthem recognize the potential for improving their capacity in promoting relevant economic sectors \nin  Chongqing  and  the  YREB.24 ADB\u2019s  involvement  changed  stakeholders\u2019  mind-set  and \nintroduced concepts of an innovation ecosystem and innovation and entrepreneurship education \nbased on best practice learned during the project preparation. The Government of the PRC and \n \n23 A \u201cliving laboratory\u201d is a place where students and faculty come together to generate new ideas for green and \nsustainable development. The facility itself demonstrates its green performance by displaying its environmental \nperformance; and students, faculty, and visitors creates the space. The living laboratory is an emerging concept, \nwhich universities in the United States and Europe adopt, followed by the developing member countries including \nthe PRC. L. Verhoef and M. Bossert. 2019. The University as a Living Lab for Sustainability: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide \nand Handbook.

Without the ADB project, different players in Chongqing\u2019s innovation ecosystem would \nnot have the opportunity to work collaboratively across industries and sectors, which is necessary \nto catalyze inclusive green industrial transformation. \n \n20.  The programs and courses to be developed and introduced at the project HEIs will focus \nmostly  on  emerging  engineering  and  technology  fields  that  contribute  to  green  industrial \ntransformation such as smart agriculture, logistics, and manufacturing; intelligent transportation \nusing alternative energy sources; and safety education that will help reduce industrial pollution \nand workplace-related accidents. HEIs will adopt advanced equipment in their new education and \ntraining programs, including big data, virtual reality, automatic control, and three-dimensional \nprinting. New courses to be introduced will adopt interdisciplinary mechanisms by integrating \neducation for innovation through close partnerships between institutions and industries. \n \n21.  From the early project preparation, ADB assessed the project\u2019s social inclusiveness. \nChongqing\u2019s unique socioeconomic situation requires support for returning migrant workers and \ntheir families, existing workers and farmers, and women. Through ADB\u2019s involvement in the \nproject design, the project became socially inclusive by extending support to various underserved \nplayers in Chongqing\u2019s innovation ecosystem. This includes (i) supporting capacities of teachers \nto educate students to address social issues; (ii) providing lifelong learning opportunities to \nprovide local workers, farmers, and returning migrants with new skills or bring their existing skills \nup to date; (iii) reducing out-migration and revitalizing areas in industrial decline; (iv) encouraging \nfemale students, workers, and teachers to participate in emerging industries and entrepreneurial \nactivities; and (v) providing support to meet the needs of women, men, children, and families. \n \n22.  It is essential that the project facilities are not only designed but also constructed, \noperated, and maintained to ensure their environmental performance. With ADB\u2019s intervention, \nthe project design will consider resource efficiency and environmental protection, buildings\u2019 life \ncycle,  human-centered  design,  and  integration  of  technology.  Facilities  will  apply  building \ninformation modeling and adopt intelligent systems to monitor, manage, and display the project \nfacilities\u2019 performance.25 The human-centered design promotes a healthy environment, reflects \nwomen\u2019s needs, and encourages networking among people to exchange ideas that promote \ninnovation. The project will provide support throughout the design, construction, and operation \nand maintenance stages to ensure quality. \n \n23.  Knowledge  sharing.  During  project  implementation,  various  available  knowledge \nplatforms will be utilized to disseminate the knowledge and good practices gained from the project \nwithin the PRC and with Asia and the Pacific. A portion of the courses developed under the project \nwill be made available online for sharing with other HEIs nationally and interested institutions in \nother developing member countries of ADB. The implementing agencies agreed to open the \nproject facilities to the public regularly to demonstrate and let people experience the (i) living \nlaboratories for education for sustainable development, and (ii) green innovation hubs. \n \n25 Building information modeling (BIM) is a process that enables integration of a built environment project on multiple \ndimensions, including spatial, cost, sequencing, and life cycle information and collaboration among developers, \ndesigners, contractors, fabricators, and operators. This increases the efficiency and sustainability of projects. The \nPRC has issued guiding opinions to promote the use of BIM to modernize and transform the construction industry, \nbut BIM\u2019s application beyond the spatial design needs further development.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n29.  The capacity building components have been designed to incorporate best practices in \ncompetency-based curricula and instruction, institution\u2013industry partnerships, and innovation and \nentrepreneurship education. The project design complies with the PRC\u2019s guidelines and local \nregulations and considers resource efficiency and environmental protection, buildings\u2019 life cycle, \nhuman-centered design, and integration of technology. The recommended technologies are \ninexpensive and suitable for Chongqing\u2019s climate. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment \nfound  that  subproject  sites  would  have  medium  risk  to  climate  change  impact,  and  the \n ", "10 \nimplementing agencies will ensure that the detailed project designs incorporate the adjustments \nto engineering designs derived from assessment results as proactive adaptation measures. Anti-\nflooding designs and evacuation devices are the principal measurements to mitigate predicted \nclimate events. All project facilities shall achieve the PRC energy efficiency standards. The project \nwill save 6,425 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year compared with the baseline scenario. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n30.  Economic. The economic analysis indicated that all the subprojects are economically \nviable, each with a positive economic net present value, and with economic internal rates of return \nabove the minimum required threshold for ADB social sector projects of 9%.28 The overall \neconomic internal rate of return of the project is estimated at 11.6%. The economic benefits from \nthe project will mainly flow from the (i) additional job opportunities in research institutions and \nenterprises, (ii) increased productivity in the project ETDAs, and (iii) increased numbers of HEI \ngraduates who will secure a job sooner.29 Additional revenue will be generated from the new \nfacilities, and resource cost savings are expected because of the project\u2019s high-quality green \ndesign and implementation mechanisms. Cost savings on industrial accidents averted are also \nexpected from the project. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the economic viability of the project \nand its subprojects is robust to negative scenarios examined, such as delayed benefit accrual, \nbenefit reduction, and increased recurrent costs. \n \n31.  Financial. Financial analysis was conducted to establish the project\u2019s financial viability \nand sustainability.30 For the revenue-generating subprojects, the financial internal rate of return \nwas compared to the weighted average cost of capital to assess viability. The Changshou \nsubproject is financially viable with a financial internal rate of return of 3.4%, which exceeds the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.0%. The Dianjiang subproject and all HEI subprojects31 are \nfinancially sustainable because the projected revenue exceeds the incremental cost. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n32.  The financial sustainability analysis shows that the fiscal burden of the subprojects in \nrelation to the respective government budget is negligible. This suggests that the financial \nrequirements of the subprojects are affordable for their respective implementing agencies and are \nfinancially sustainable. The CMG has assured ADB that it will provide the necessary counterpart \nfunding to cover the project\u2019s operation and maintenance costs and debt service repayments, in \ncase any of the institutions fail to fulfill their financing requirements. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n33.  Financial management. A financial management assessment confirmed that the CMG \nand  the  seven  implementing  agencies  have  adequate  financial  management  capacity  to \nimplement  the  project.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate,  mainly  because  of \nimplementing agencies\u2019 lack of familiarity with ADB\u2019s financial management and disbursement \nrequirements and procedures. The risks will be mitigated by the early engagement of a financial \nmanagement consultant and the provision of training. A financial management action plan agreed \n \n28 In constant 2019 prices. Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The full economic benefits of the project are expected to be significantly higher, as the analysis excludes some \nindirect economic and ecological benefits that are not easily quantifiable, such as quality improvements, production \ncost reductions, reduced skill search costs, improved innovation capacity, and improved working conditions. \n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Subprojects of CJU, CSVC, CUE, CUST, and CVIE. \n ", "11 \nwith the CMG is described in the PAM (footnote 26) and will be closely monitored during project \nimplementation. \n \n34.  Procurement. Value for money will be achieved through contract packaging, selection of \nprocurement method and bidding procedure, and proposed advance procurement arrangement; \nthese were the result of a strategic procurement planning exercise that took into account the \nstrategic project priorities, risks and opportunities, operating conditions of the borrowers, and the \nmarket conditions. The overall procurement risk is medium. Measures to mitigate the risks are in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \n35.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.33 No significant integrity risks were identified. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, the CMG, and the implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  A total 311,924 people will benefit from the project, comprising 151,522 direct beneficiaries \n(42% women and 3% poor) and 160,402 indirect beneficiaries (51% women and 3% poor). The \nproject will (i) improve students\u2019 capacity and employability in the labor market through access to \nquality teaching, practices, and a better learning environment in the HEIs; (ii) address supply and \ndemand gaps in education and emerging business sectors; (iii) enhance teachers\u2019 capacity to \nintegrate an innovative and entrepreneurial approach into their teaching; (iv) facilitate returning \nmigrants\u2019 reintegration into the labor market and enhance their access to public and social \nservices; (v) establish a support system for children in difficult situations, including migrant \nworkers\u2019 left-behind children, through relevant field research, teachers\u2019 capacity enhancement, \nand social work service development; and (vi) make the project area economically vibrant through \nthe  promotion  of  innovation  and  entrepreneurship  and  close  cooperation  among  HEIs, \nenterprises,  and  ETDAs.  The  project  is  estimated  to  create  about  5,050  jobs  during  the \nconstruction and operation phases for local people, including 4,820 skilled jobs (27% women) and \n230 non-skilled jobs (48% women). A social and gender action plan (SGAP) was prepared and \nits implementation will be monitored.34 \n \n37.  The project is categorized gender equity theme and will significantly benefit women\u2014who \nare disadvantaged in the labor market\u2014mainly because of imbalanced gender labor division in \nthe household. It will directly address women\u2019s skills development and employment by narrowing \ngender disparities through access to social services, economic and financial resources, and \nopportunities. The project will benefit and empower women by enhancing women\u2019s skills to make \nthem more competitive in the labor market, encouraging their participation in economic activities \noutside the home, and supporting them in organizing their children\u2019s care and education in newly \nestablished daycare centers. In the project HEIs, female teachers and students will benefit from \nthe improved teaching\u2013learning facilities, new training opportunities, and capacity building on \ninnovation and entrepreneurship. The project will provide training programs for women; establish \nwomen\u2019s associations to facilitate communication relating to innovation policies and support \nprograms; and create employment opportunities for returning migrants and local people, including \nwomen with lower education and skills but with a high burden in looking after their family. \n \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 2003.

The SGAP will help to (i) ensure gender- and child-friendly design features for the newly \nbuilt facilities in project HEIs and ETDAs, including children\u2019s daycare centers; (ii) establish a \ngender-sensitive and age- and disabled-friendly one-stop service platform to provide public \nservices, employment guidance, and counseling; (iii) initiate a female students\u2019 empowerment \nprogram, establish an entrepreneurship fund, and target a 20% participation rate of female \nstudents in innovation- and entrepreneurship-related contests; (iv) design career development \ncoaching for female students to enter engineering schools; (v) provide modern agricultural \ntechnical training for students and local people, including women; (vi) develop gender- and child-\nsensitive courses and learning materials to support education for children in difficult situations, \nincluding migrant workers\u2019 left-behind children; (vii) provide priority employment opportunities for \nwomen during project construction and operation, with at least 27% skilled jobs and 48% non-\nskilled jobs designated for women; (viii) support the prevention of sexual harassment, exploitation, \nand abuse; and (ix) develop capacity of the CPMO and implementing agencies on SGAP \nimplementation, monitoring, and reporting. \n \n39.  The project will ensure that contractors follow core labor standards, and disseminate \ninformation at construction sites and provide training to construction workers on HIV/AIDS and \nsexually transmitted infections, sexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse in collaboration with \nlocal centers for disease control and implementing agencies. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n40.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.35 \n \n41.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination and environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) were prepared for the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and disclosed on the ADB website. Potential environmental impacts include \n(i) dust, noise, soil runoff, and tree cutting during construction; (ii) temporary traffic disturbances \nbecause of transportation of construction materials; (iii) risks to community and workers\u2019 health \nand  safety  during  construction;  and  (iv)  wastewater  and  solid  waste generated  during  the \nconstruction and operation. The EMP defines mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and \ninstitutional responsibilities to ensure proper environmental management throughout construction \nand operation. The environmental management capabilities of the executing and implementing \nagencies were strengthened through on-the-job training and will be further enhanced by capacity \ndevelopment proposed under the project. Potential affected persons and stakeholders were \nconsulted and their concerns have been incorporated in the project design and will be addressed \nthrough effective implementation of the EMP. The CPMO will establish a grievance redress \nmechanism. The executing agency will submit semiannual internal environmental monitoring \nreports to ADB. An external monitor will also submit semiannual monitoring reports to the \nexecuting agency and ADB. \n \n42.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will implement seven subprojects \nwith five HEIs and two ETDAs, and involve 409.9 mu of land acquisition and 10,500 square meters \nof house demolition.36 Five of the seven subprojects have completed their land acquisition, and \ntheir due diligence confirmed that there are no past or present concerns and outstanding \ngrievances on involuntary resettlement.37 The subproject at CUE will not result in resettlement \n \n35 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n36 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n37 These five subprojects (at Changshou, CJU, CSVC, CUST, and CVIE) involved land acquisition of 339.4 mu and \nhouse demolition of 10,500 square meters. \n ", "13 \nimpacts. The Dianjiang subproject will acquire 70.5 mu of rural collective lands and affect \n111 households  with  511  persons,  but  will  not  involve  demolition  of  houses,  shops,  and \ninstitutions. Income loss impacts have been assessed as less than 10% for 110 of the 111 affected \nhouseholds. A draft resettlement plan was prepared for the Dianjiang subproject, and key \ninformation in the resettlement plan and due diligence report were disclosed to the affected \npersons. During implementation, training on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement will be provided to \nthe CPMO and implementing agencies. A grievance redress mechanism has been established, \nand an external agency will be engaged for semiannual resettlement monitoring. \n \n43.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project locations do not have a concentration of \nethnic minority people.38 In the project\u2019s five HEIs, about 5%\u20139% of students are ethnic minorities, \nof which about 60%\u201390% are Tujia and Miao people from Chongqing who speak Chongqing \ndialect and are socioeconomically mainstreamed with the Han people. No adverse impact by the \nproject on ethnic minorities is envisaged. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n44.  There are no high or substantial risks to this project. The overall risk assessment of the \nproject is moderate, and the benefits and impact are expected to outweigh the costs. The risks, \nwhich are rated either moderate or low, and the mitigation measures are described in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan (footnote 32). \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n45.  The government and CMG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.

Chongqing (in Chinese). \nd  The estimate is based on the following assumption: not all graduates, including women, will find jobs in strategic \nemerging industries, or some will find emerging industries jobs outside Chongqing. Although the project aims to \nempower women and female students, changing mind-sets needs time. Achieving the same percentage of female \nstudents (as male students) who are trained to get jobs in strategic emerging industries is still challenging, as the \nproject cannot force women or female students to take certain jobs, or employers to employ women. However, the \nproject will significantly contribute to an increase in the number of women entering into strategic emerging industries. \ne  At the early stage of project implementation, the executing and implementing agencies, supported by the project \nmanagement consultants, will develop detailed definition and methodologies to measure performance. \nf  The female baseline ratios are proxies estimated through consultations with the CPMO and implementing agencies. \nExact baselines will be obtained at the early stage of the implementation. \ng  Gender-inclusive facilities are facilities that consider the specific needs of women and men, e.g., adequate lighting \nfor safety, separate toilet facilities (with disabled-friendly features), and children\u2019s daycare centers. \nContribution to the Asian Development Bank Results Framework: \nRFI A: Jobs generated. Expected: 8,000 (2,000 female; 6,000 male). RFI B: Skilled jobs for women generated. \nExpected: 2,000. RFI C: People benefiting from improved health services, education services, or social protection. \nExpected: 12,000 (4,200 female; 7,800 male). RFI D: Total annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction (tCO2e per \nyear). Expected: 6,425 tCO2e per year (resource-efficient facility design solutions at six subproject sites will result in a \nreduction of 8.57 million kilowatt-hours per annum) reduced, from 32,328 tCO2e to 25,903 tCO2e.
