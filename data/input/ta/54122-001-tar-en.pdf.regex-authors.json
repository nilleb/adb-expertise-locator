INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  capital  market \ndevelopment  and  reform  in  selected  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The TA will help identify the required key market infrastructure as well \nas  the  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  to  foster  long-term  development  financing  for \ngovernments  and  corporations.  This  phase  1  TA  will  support  Azerbaijan,  Mongolia,  and \nUzbekistan. It will draw on lessons learned from the region\u2019s varied experiences, focusing on local \ncurrency  government  and  corporate  bond  market  development.  A  phase  2  TA  project  is \nenvisioned to deepen capital markets further and broaden outreach to other countries.\n \n \n2.  The  TA  is  included  in  the  2021 Management-approved results-based  work  plan  of \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC). The TA is aligned with the \nfollowing operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, (iii) strengthening governance \nand  institutional  capacity,  and  (iv)  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration.1  \nIt will support the expansion of deep, efficient, and diversified financial markets to meet long-term \nfinancing needs, enhance financial stability, and eventually enable sustainable infrastructure \nfinancing and socioeconomic development for DMCs.2\n \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n3.  Benefits of local capital markets. Developing deep and efficient local capital markets \ncreates multiple benefits. Many Asian countries face a massive financing gap, especially for \nsustainable infrastructure. A well-functioning local capital market can help mobilize and allocate \nlong-term local currency financing in more sustainable ways and with less macroeconomic risk, \nthereby contributing to a country\u2019s economic growth and poverty reduction. The G20 recognizes \nthat a well-developed local currency bond market protects against global capital flows; reduces \nreliance on foreign currency borrowings, which are subject to exchange rate risks; and allows \nbank and corporate balance sheets to adjust more smoothly to economic cycles, among others.3 \nLiquid capital markets in local currency also improve domestic resource mobilization, diversify \nfunding  sources,  enhance  financial  stability,  and  support  the  banking  system\u2019s  maturity \ntransformation functions. \n \n4.  Impact of COVID-19. The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) underscores the \nneed for enhanced debt management by developing efficient local capital markets. The COVID-\n19 pandemic has triggered rising public expenditures and declining revenues, putting pressure \non  government  financing  across  developing  countries.4  Underlying  issues  in  the  banking \nsegment, such as asset quality deterioration and bank recapitalization, are expected to worsen \nunder current economic conditions. Domestic government bond issuance can help countercyclical \npublic spending, and corporate bond issuance can support the real economy, by supplementing \nthe banking sector with much needed liquidity. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Strategy 2030: Operational Plans.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 October 2020. \n3   ADB. 2019. Good Practices for Developing a Local Currency Bond Market: Lessons from the ASEAN+3 Asian Bond \nMarkets Initiative. Manila. \n4  Fiscal deficits are estimated to reach 12.8% of gross domestic product in Azerbaijan, 5.3% in Mongolia, and 3.3% in \nUzbekistan in 2020 (International Monetary Fund. World Economic Outlook Database, April 2020 Edition). ", " \n2 \n5.  Lack of recognition of benefits of local capital markets. The benefits of efficient local \ncapital markets are not widely recognized, which leaves many DMCs with undeveloped local \ncapital markets. Despite their potential benefits, capital markets in many countries in the region \nare still nascent, inefficient, or not liquid. In 2019, outstanding government securities were 2.3% \nof  gross  domestic  product  in  Azerbaijan,5  32.1%  in  Mongolia,6  and  0.5%  in  Uzbekistan.7  \nThe absence of an active government bond market or even of a government issuance program \nof short maturity securities with limited trading (and the absence of a secondary market) prevents \nthe establishment of a pricing benchmark, such as the yield curve, which is necessary for the \ndevelopment of corporate bond markets and other financial instruments (e.g., social, green, or \nimpact bonds) (footnote 3).8 The high level of dollarization of these economies, which impedes \nbond market development, reflects volatile local currencies. \n \n6.  Local capital market development implementation strategy. Many DMCs do not have \na well sequenced and coordinated local capital market development implementation strategy. \nCapital  market  development  involves  government  ownership  and  commitment\u2014closely \ncoordinating complex, separate activities to form the necessary ecosystem and macroeconomic \nconditions for effective capital market transactions. Understanding of the appropriate sequencing \nof milestone achievements and the role that each institution plays needs to be enhanced. Many \ncountries also lack a strategic plan for capital market development and a forum for key agencies \nto coordinate their efforts. \n \n7.  Legal and regulatory framework. DMCs need to strengthen the legal and regulatory \nframework as well as effective market infrastructure to build and maintain well-functioning local \ncapital  markets.  Capital  market  development  must  be  supported  by  laws  and  regulations \n(bankruptcy, tax, corporate governance, transparency, and disclosure standards) to attract a \ndiversified  issuer  and  investor  base.  Market  infrastructure\u2014such  as  an  exchange  system, \ndepository system, valuation system, registration system, clearing system, and primary dealer \nsystem\u2014is also needed to facilitate the smooth operation of the market. \n \n8.  Supply side. In the absence of an effective enabling framework, securities issuance \nbecomes  too  costly  and  unviable  for  the  supply  side  of  the  capital  market  to  develop. \nGovernments, financial institutions, and private companies use local currency bond markets to a \nvery limited extent to raise capital. Contributing factors include lack of recognition of its benefits \nand low availability of capital market products; limited experience of the public and private sectors \nin communicating with investors; and weak corporate governance integrating best  practice \naccounting reporting and auditing standards to comply with the disclosure requirements of \nefficient capital markets. \n \n9.  Demand side. On the demand side, investment in capital market products is limited by \ninsufficient local institutional investors and incentives to invest in high-risk bond markets. Pension \nfunds are limited, and insurance companies and local savings and insurance markets are not well \ndeveloped. No infrastructure, such as funds and trusts, is in place for indirect vehicles. Banks are \nthe primary investors and hold their securities until maturity, which impedes the development of \n \n5  Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Manila (TA 9770-UZB). \n8  As of January 2020, Azerbaijan had nine issuers and local corporate bonds outstanding totaled $2.0 billion (Cbonds. \nAzerbaijan). Uzbekistan had nine corporate bonds outstanding at the end of July 2019, totaling $40 million (footnote \n7). In Mongolia, local investors started investing in privately placed, unregulated, corporate bond instruments in 2018, \nwith $8.3 million of outstanding debts (footnote 6).  \n ", " \n3 \na secondary market. Demand for securities is hampered by perceived high risks, lack of tax \nincentives, and the availability of other low-risk, high-yield financial products such as deposits and \nreal  estate.  Further,  investors  do  not  have  information  based  on  standardized  accounting \npractices and credible credit ratings to facilitate investment decisions. \n \n10.  Lessons learned. This TA will draw on lessons learned from previous ADB projects \nrelated to capital market development and domestic resource mobilization.9 Previous projects \nhave emphasized taking a long-term approach, adhering to appropriate sequencing of reforms, \nand enhancing market infrastructure to put in place a well-functioning capital market. Careful \ndiagnostics and consultations, as well as enhanced coordination, are also necessary. Further, \nexperience shows that the creation of a multi-stakeholder association can be a sustainable model \nfor pursuing initiatives to develop the market.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: enabling environment for deep and efficient \nlocal currency bond markets improved (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: \ncapacity for local currency bond market development strengthened.11\n \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Local capital market assessments completed. The TA will analyze the \ncapital markets of Azerbaijan, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan.12 A review of existing finance sector \nand capital market diagnostics, plans, and strategies will be conducted under the TA which will \nlead to technical studies to determine the capital market development progress against the \nsequencing of milestone achievements and comparison with other countries. This will be achieved \nthrough stakeholder consultations with relevant public and private sector entities, at a proposed \nforum for interaction. Stakeholders will jointly establish and validate country-specific road maps \nand strategic market development implementation plans, to address the identified gaps and \nrequired policy recommendations and capacity building in legal and regulatory frameworks, \neffective market infrastructure, and market supply and demand mechanisms. \n \n13.  Output 2: Knowledge sharing events on capital market development conducted. \nCapacity development will be based on the key findings under output 1 and will focus on the \nidentified gaps and agreed priorities for each country. It will also cover international best practices, \nincluding  success  factors  unique  to  the  respective  regions  in  terms  of  policies,  laws  and \nregulations,  infrastructure  and  information  technology  systems,  market  mechanisms,  and \nproducts. This will be carried out through specific webinars, workshops, study tours, and other \ncapacity  building  activities  for  policymakers,  financial  authorities,  and  financial  market \nstakeholders.

Government clearances will be \nsought after TA approval. \n ", " \n4 \ninternational institutions will be pursued to tap their expertise in bond market development and to \nfacilitate sharing of experiences by other countries. \n \n14.  The TA will transfer knowledge and make policy recommendations to DMCs for the \ndevelopment of capital markets to support the operational priority areas of Strategy 2030. The \nbasis for these recommendations will be the findings of the country assessments and technical \nstudies, as well as lessons gathered in seminars, capacity building, and knowledge sharing \nevents. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s value addition. This TA will leverage the experience and knowledge built by the \nASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative,13 and complement the ongoing efforts of ADB operations \ndepartments and other development organizations in the selected DMCs.14 The TA will contribute \nto the various ADB programs and projects to support the financial markets development strategies \nof the DMCs. SDCC will produce knowledge products for wider dissemination of innovative ideas \nand lessons through ADB Knowledge Events. Where possible, the TA will complement and \nsupplement existing and proposed initiatives and activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n17.  Eligible and ineligible expenditures. The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund will finance operational expenses related to eligible proposals agreed upon by \nthe Government of the Republic of Korea and ADB.
