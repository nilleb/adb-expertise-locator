INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Pakistan requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to support the establishment and initial operationalization of an autonomous central \npower  purchasing  agency  (CPPA)  in  Pakistan\u2019s  power  sector.  An  autonomous  CPPA  will \nprovide transparency and independence to the settlement and payment system in Pakistan\u2019s \npower sector.1 \n \n2.  A  consultation  mission  was  fielded  in  May  2014,  where  the  government  and  ADB \nmission agreed on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference. This technical assistance (TA) is included in the country \noperations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Pakistan.2 The concept paper was approved on 20 \nJune 2014. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Sector structure and reforms. The government has been implementing a strategic \npower sector restructuring and unbundling plan since 1992 to address the country\u2019s persistent \npower crisis. The progress of the reforms has been slow and the country's power supply and \ninfrastructure  requirements  have  not  kept  pace  with  rising  demand,  constraining  growth \npotential and the country\u2019s competitiveness. The current average supply\u2013demand gap is 4,500\u2013\n6,000 megawatts, resulting in routine load shedding of up to 12 hours in urban areas and 18\u201320 \nhours in rural areas.4  \n \n4.  Reforms to the sector structure to date include the unbundling and corporatization of the \nWater  and  Power  Development  Authority  into  nine  regional  distribution  companies,  four \ngovernment-owned thermal power generation companies, and a transmission company licensed \nalso  as  a  single  buyer  and  seller  of  electricity\u2014the  National  Transmission  and  Despatch \nCompany. The Water and Power Development Authority has retained the hydropower plants. All \nare fully owned by the government. K-Electric, which is responsible for power generation and \ndistribution in the Karachi area, is listed on the stock exchange and is privately owned. Privately \nowned independent power producers generate 56% of the country\u2019s power (footnote 4). The \nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was established to determine tariffs, \nissue licenses, and regulate and ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector. The Ministry \nof Water and Power sets sector policies, including the tariffs paid by electricity customers. \n \n5.  To continue the reform process and achieve transparency, market focus, and private \nsector  investment,  it  is  critical  to  establish  an  independent  purchasing  and  settlement \norganization in the form of an autonomous CPPA. Currently, a dedicated unit within the National \nTransmission and Despatch Company completes all electricity market settlement and payment \nfunctions. This TA project will assist with the decoupling of the market settlement and payment \nfunctions from the National Transmission and Despatch Company and the establishment of the \nCPPA as an autonomous settlements company with well-defined governance and financial \nstructures. \n \n                                                \n1  Market settlement and payment functions include the verification of generation and consumption data, calculation \nof associated charges, issuing of invoices, and payment and collection of funds.  \n2   ADB. 2014.

State of Industry Report, 2012. \nIslamabad.   \n ", "2     \n6.  Sector  performance.  In  2012,  electricity  distribution  and  transmission  losses  in \nPakistan reached 23% compared with NEPRA\u2019s target of 16%, and collection amounted to 86% \nof  total  billing  compared  with  the  target  of  100%.  In  2013,  receivables  owed  by  private \ncustomers totaled $2.6 billion or 1.14% of gross domestic product, whereas receivables owed \nby provincial and federal government customers increased by 7% from 2008 to 2013 and \ntotaled  $1.5  billion  or  0.66%  of  gross  domestic  product.  The  lack  of  transparency  in  the \noperation and payment mechanisms has made it difficult to hold private and public sector \ncompanies accountable for their performance. The establishment of an autonomous CPPA will \nmake the settlement and payment system independent and transparent.5   \n \n7.  Government  strategy. This TA project supports the new government\u2019s priorities of \nreforming the energy sector and state-owned enterprises, and restoring sustainability in the \npower sector. In July 2013, the government approved the National Power Policy to support the \ncountry\u2019s current and future energy needs. The policy seeks to eliminate load shedding by 2017, \nby (i) reducing the average system-wide generation cost from $0.12 per kilowatt-hour to $0.10 \nper kilowatt-hour by 2017, (ii) decreasing transmission and distribution losses from the current \n23% to 16% by 2017, and (iii) increasing revenue collection from 85% to 95% of total billing by \n2017. The government also aims to reduce processing times for all sector operations. \n \n8.  ADB assistance program. Reforming the energy sector is a key objective of Pakistan\u2019s \ninterim country partnership strategy, 2014-2015 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020.6 This TA project is included in Pakistan\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2014\u20132016 (footnote 2).  \n \n9.  This TA project is aligned with ADB\u2019s programmatic approach for the Sustainable Energy \nSector Reform Program.7 It will update and operationalize the recommendations prepared under \na TA project completed in 2006 that were not implemented by the government at that time \nbecause  of  broader  structural  issues,  including  insufficient  capacity  within  the  NEPRA  to \nformulate market rules.8 The United States Agency for International Development is providing \nassistance to the NEPRA on preparing market rules under which the CPPA will operate.  \n \n10.  Capacity.  Because  of  the  limited  institutional  and  management  exposure  to  an \nautonomous  and  transparent  electricity  settlement  system  in  the  sector,  the  support  of \ninternational expertise for the newly engaged CPPA management team, to be provided through \nthis TA, is considered a key prerequisite for the successful operationalization of the CPPA. \n     \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be improved financial management and governance in Pakistan\u2019s power \nsector. This will be indicated by a more transparent market with market pricing available for \nevery  trading  period.  The  outcome  will  be  that  the  CPPA  operates  an  autonomous  and \n                                                \n5  Broader structural issues in the power sector are being addressed under ABD\u2019s Programmatic Approach for the \nSustainable Energy Sector Reform Program (footnote 6). \n6  ADB. 2014.

Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The objective of the TA project is to support and enable the establishment and initial \noperationalization of an autonomous CPPA. This will be achieved by embedding the required \ninternational and national consultants in the CPPA to provide management support, capacity \nbuilding,  access  to  expert  resources,  and  training  for  the  CPPA\u2019s  management  team  and \nemployees.   \n \n13.  The TA project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will include the development of \nthe establishment and operation preparedness road map and associated initial internal budget. \nPreliminary drafts of the additional reporting requirements will be prepared, as required, to \ninform the road map and associated initial budget. Once the road map and internal budget have \nbeen endorsed by the CPPA board of directors, ongoing management support, capacity building, \ntraining for the CPPA management team and employees, and reporting requirements will be \ncompleted during phase 2. The table summarizes the outputs for each phase. \n \nTechnical Assistance Outputs \nOutput  Phase 1  Phase 2 \n1  Road map for establishment and   \noperationalization prepared \n2    Management and organizational structure \nestablished \n3    Standard market agreements prepared \n4    Initial information and technology system \nplan drafted \n5    Internal and external training manuals and \nactivities completed \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.  Before the TA project commences, the CPPA\u2019s key management positions, including the \nchief executive officer, chief legal officer, chief finance officer, and company secretary, must be \nfilled with appropriate personnel.9  \n \n15.  It is assumed the government\u2019s commitment to restructuring the sector continues, timely \ngovernment  financial  support  for  sector  is  maintained  for  as  long  as  required,  and  the \nconcurrent work on the market rule guidelines and market rules being completed by the United \nStates Agency for International Development are satisfactorily completed within the targeted \ntime frame. The risks associated with this TA include political pressures delaying or preventing \ntariff reforms, and deterioration in the security situation within the country delaying consultants \nand/or counterpart resources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,700,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n                                                \n9   The Ministry of Water and Power has indicated that these appointments will be completed by the fourth quarter of   \n     2014. \n ", "4     \n17.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space  and \nequipment; counterpart staff and technical support; communication facilities; access to data and \nother relevant information; organizational support related to workshops, training, and meetings \nto  assist  the  consultants  during  implementation;  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Ministry of Water and Power will be the executing agency, and the CPPA will be the \nimplementing agency. TA administration will not be delegated to the executing or implementing \nagency, but will instead be done by the Energy Division, Central and West Asia Department. \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n  \n19.  The TA project will be implemented over 18 months, from February 2015 to July 2016. \nAn international firm of consultants (or consortium) will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using quality-based \nselection and a full technical proposal. The quality-based selection method is required because \nthe TA project is complex and highly specialized, and the quality of the services is of overriding \nimportance for the outcome of the TA project. The firm will provide four international consultants \n(23 person-months) and five national consultants (45 person-months). The consultants will \nconsist of a settlements expert, a power sector expert, legal experts, information technology \nexperts, accounting and finance experts, and a human resources expert. Outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  A communication and stakeholder management plan will be prepared by the consultants \nduring the initial stages of the TA to facilitate the participation of stakeholders and dissemination \nof knowledge.  \n \nIV.
