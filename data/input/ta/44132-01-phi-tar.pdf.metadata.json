INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to pilot and develop viable business models for \nrural community-based renewable energy in Mindanao. A fact-finding mission fielded 24\u201328 \nMay  2010  held  discussions  with  officials  of  the  Department  of  Energy  and  the  National \nElectrification  Administration  (NEA).  The  mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the \ngovernment on the impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, \nand terms of reference for the TA. 1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES   \n2.  The government strongly believes that providing electrical service to people and areas \nwithout  it  improves  quality  of  life,  expands  access  to  basic  services,  and  strengthens \ninfrastructure for rural development. Rural electrification has been one of the top policy priority \nof the Philippine government for decades. By June 2010, through joint efforts by government \nand the private sector, the Philippines had achieved 99% rural electrification at the barangay2 \nlevel. In smaller communities, or sitios, which are the administrative unit below the barangay, \nhowever, the rate was only 69% and about 3.5 million of the country\u2019s households were still \nwithout electricity. In Mindanao, the country\u2019s southernmost region comprising Mindanao Island \nand smaller adjacent island groups, the electrification rate, at 60%, was far below the national \naverage of 74%. The government established an expanded rural electrification program in 2003 \nto strengthen and integrate government and private sector efforts on rural electrification. Among \nits goals was the electrification of 90% of the households in country\u2019s sitios by 2017. Most \nunelectrified  sitios  are  remote  and  can  be  serviced  most  economically  through  renewable \nenergy produced by microhydro, solar photovoltaic, and hybrid power systems. Hybrid power \nsystems combine energy technologies\u2014for example, solar photovoltaic with wind generation, \nsolar photovoltaic or wind with diesel generation, and solar thermal with biomass-fired heat for \ndrying and other thermal applications. \n \n3.  ADB's country strategy and program (CSP) 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines,3 which has \nbeen extended to 2010, emphasizes support for removing infrastructure bottlenecks in the \npower, transport, and agriculture sectors to increase the country\u2019s competitiveness. A supply of \nsecure, affordable electricity is viewed as a particularly important key to promoting sustainable \ngrowth. The CSP also recognizes that electrification is central to rural development. The poorest \nhouseholds and communities in the Philippines are found in its far-flung, unelectrified sitios. This \nis especially true in the northeastern Mindanao region of Caraga to be targeted under the \nproposed TA, where the incidence of poverty in 2006 was 45.5%, substantially above the 38.8% \nrate for Mindanao as a whole and the national average of 26.9%.  \n \n4.  The  proposed  TA  is  part  of  ADB's  Energy  for  All  Initiative4 to  develop  innovative \napproaches to giving the poor access to affordable, modern energy and scaling up the use of \nrenewable  energy.  Access  to  energy  underpins  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  mission  and  the \nStrategy  20205 agendas  of  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  Maximizing \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 October 2010.  \n2  A barangay is a unit of administration consisting of 50 to 100 families under an administrator (captain). \n3  ADB. 2005.

The proposed TA is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities in the sector, i.e., (i) \ncontinuing support for power sector restructuring, (ii) strengthening the electricity distribution \nsector, (iii) promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, and (iv) targeting support to \nreduce rural poverty. In addition, the development of sustainable renewable energy resources is \nurgently needed to ease current power shortages and diversify the energy mix to meet the \ngrowing energy demand in Mindanao.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA will impact investment in renewable energy projects in the Philippines. The \noutcome will be development of a business model for livelihood development using renewable \nenergy in the Caraga region of Mindanao.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The  formulation  and  design  of  the  proposed  TA  have  benefited  from  the  recently \ncompleted Renewable Energy and Livelihood Development Project for Negros Occidental,7 \nwhich was financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. It provided important lessons \nregarding  the  generation  of  livelihood  activities  through  the  use  of  renewable  energy  and \nthrough a revolving fund operated by community-based organizations (CBOs). CBOs to be \nestablished under the TA will help implement the project and ensure the long-term sustainability \nof the renewable energy plants and their benefits. Gender and indigenous people issues will be \nidentified and addressed through the CBOs. Using the Caraga region as the pilot area, the TA \nwill formulate business models that will involve the public and private sector in developing \nrenewable  energy  in  Mindanao.  Caraga  was  selected  based  on  a  preliminary  resource \nassessment and ongoing activities by other development partners in other parts of Mindanao. \nThe cost of renewable energy and the ability of rural consumers to afford it will be key elements \nin  designing  business  models  involving  private  sector  participation.  The  TA  will  create  a \nrevolving fund that will be operated by a microfinance organization at first but turned over \neventually  to  up  to  five  local  CBOs  in  the  communities  eventually  identified  for  the  pilot \nrenewable  energy  projects.  The  fund  will  provide  financial  assistance  to  help  the  project \nbeneficiaries use the energy productively to generate income, which will pay for the energy \nservices and the maintenance of the pilot facilities. \n \n8.  The TA will develop the renewable business models through at least five pilot systems, \nusing  microhydro,  solar  photovoltaic,  small  wind,  and  other  indigenous  sources,  with  an \nestimated capacity of 200 kilowatts (kW) overall to serve the energy needs of about 1,500 \nhouseholds in the Caraga region of Mindanao. The TA is expected to generate the following \noutputs:  \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy.Manila.  \n7  ADB. 2004. Renewable Energy and Livelihood Development Project for the Poor in Negros Occidental. Manila. \n \n ", "  3\n9.  Output 1: Renewable energy resource and demand assessment. This will cover the \nfollowing preparatory activities: \n(i)  assess energy resources (on grid and off grid); \n(ii)  review  available  appropriate  renewable  energy  technologies  and  business \nmodels; \n(iii)  review  infrastructure  and  private  sector  capacity,  e.g.,  manufacturing \ncapacities/capabilities and transport infrastructure; \n(iv)  develop service delivery mechanism; \n(v)  develop  a  socioeconomic  profile  of  beneficiaries,  identify  indigenous  people, \nconduct gender analysis, and prepare a gender action plan; \n(vi)  assess  end  user  needs  for  various  energy  forms  for  different  uses,  the \ntechnology and supply mechanisms for the different end user groups, and the \nassociated poverty and gender implications; and \n(vii)  develop a model for financing and innovative payment schemes. \n \n10.  Output 2: Pilot renewable energy projects.  The following activities will implement \npilot project:  \n(i)  construct and install five demonstration renewable energy systems in selected \nsitios; \n(ii)  organize  people\u2019s  organizations  to  operate  and  manage  these  power  plant \nsystems; \n(iii)  train technicians and operators, at least 20% of whom should be women;  \n(iv)  conduct financial and economic analyses of the renewable energy facilities; and \n(v)  identify local sources for the supply of spare parts.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Productive use of renewable energy.8 This will directly benefit people and \nand will: \n(i)  build capacity of CBO on small enterprise development; \n(ii)  transfer technology on productive uses of energy, with inputs; \n(iii)  enhance productivity and livelihoods through technology assistance, business \nadvice, the value chain, and market linkages; \n(iv)  provide links to microfinance institutions or credit facilities to support the  capital \nrequirements of the new technology and/or for value addition; and  \n(v)  ensure that at least of half of beneficiaries will be women or households headed \nby women. \n \n12.  Output 4: Establishment of CBOs and revolving fund for livelihood enhancement. \nThe  revolving  fund  will  provide  microcredit  to  households  to  cover  the  costs  of  electrical \nconnections  and  the  purchase  of  appliances,  and  to  fund  the  livelihood  projects  they  will \nundertake with the use of electricity. This component of the TA focuses on capacity building in \nthe CBOs, which will directly benefit rural residents in the project area, particularly women. \nRural  households  will  be  organized  into  viable  CBOs  able  to  manage  diverse  community \nprojects on their own. The CBOs will also act as barangay power associations (BAPAs). The TA \nwill provide training in organizational management and leadership skills development, simple \naccounting and bookkeeping, project development and management, and product value-adding \nand marketing. Suitable candidates will be trained to be microhydro operators, managers, and \n                                                 \n8\u00a0Productive use of energy is defined here as the utilization of energy\u2014both electric, and non-electric thermal or \nmechanical energy\u2014for activities that support economic and social development, increases in income, and the \nimprovement of welfare. These productive uses of energy typically involve agriculture, fisheries, rural enterprise, and \ncommunity services such as education, water supply, and health services and facilities.\u00a0\u00a0 \n ", "4  \nrepair  and  maintenance  technicians.  The  CBOs  will  play  a  significant  role  in  project \nimplementation,  particularly  in  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  renewable  energy \nfacilities. \n \n13.  Output 5: Knowledge dissemination. The TA will develop a knowledge kit based on its \noutputs and results and prepare a knowledge dissemination plan through workshops, training, \nand an internet website. Dissemination will target stakeholders in the Philippines as well as \nother  developing  member  countries,  particularly  those  with  similar  geographic  and  climate \nconditions.  \n \n14.  Based on lessons from the previous renewable energy and livelihood project financed by \nthe  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (footnote  7),  the  potential  TA  implementation  risks \ninclude  (i) limited availability of adequate human and financial resources in the project areas; \n(ii) failure by local communities to take ownership of pilot projects; (iii) inability of pilot projects to \nidentify  sustainable  delivery  models;  and  (iv)  poor  maintenance  of  the  microhydro  plants, \nresulting in lower output. The TA will mitigate these risks by carefully identifying renewable \nenergy technologies appropriate to local conditions and by training CBOs properly. A voluntary \ncarbon market will be considered and may be tapped to enhance the cost effectiveness of the \nrenewable energy facilities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,400,000 of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis, by the Asian Clean Energy Fund9 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, \nand administered by ADB. Of the $2,000,000 grant, $450,000 (22.5%) will be used to install pilot \nrenewable energy facilities. The Government of the Philippines, through the NEA, will provide \nthe  equivalent  of  $400,000  in  kind  in  the  form  of  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  the \ncommunity contribution to the civil works. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The NEA will be the executing agency for the TA and will collaborate closely with the \nlocal electric cooperatives and other relevant government agencies. The NEA will assign a \nproject  coordinator  before  contract  negotiations  and  counterpart  staff  to  work  with  the \nconsultants.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months, beginning 1 March 2011. The consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). The simplified technical proposal and quality- and-cost-based \nselection procedures (using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10) will be used in selecting the consulting \nfirm. The consultant will design, procure, and install the pilot renewable energy facilities under \nthe TA. The procurement of equipment for the pilot renewable energy plants will be undertaken \nby the consultant through the shopping method in accordance with Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                 \n9  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5\n18.  The consultant team will provide 52 person-months of services, including 22 person-\nmonths  by  international  consultants  and  30  person-months  by  national  consultants.  The \ninternational consultants will include one renewable energy specialist (team leader, 12 person-\nmonths) and one project financial specialist (10 person-months). The national consultants will \ninclude two rural electrification engineers (16 person-months), one procurement specialist (4 \nperson-months), and a social development and gender specialist (10 person-months). The \nconsultant team will prepare inception, interim, draft final, and final reports, due in 4 weeks, 12 \nmonths, 20 months, and 24 months, respectively, after the services start. The design of the pilot \nproject and procurement plan will be included in the interim report, and the installation of pilot \nprojects will be completed by the end of the TA, with a separate pilot project completion report. \nTripartite meetings of the NEA, the consultants, and ADB will be held for the presentation and \nreview of the initial, interim, and draft final reports.  \n \n19.  A revolving fund will be established as a pilot scheme under the TA to finance household \nconnections to renewable energy-based electricity and energy-based livelihood development \nthrough CBOs. The NEA, supported by consultants, will identify a local microcredit financing \ninstitution10 to  set  up  and  operate  the  revolving  fund,  and  provide  financial  operation  and \nmanagement training. At the end of the TA period, operation of the revolving fund is to be turned \nover  to  the  newly  created  CBOs,  which  will  have  already  participated  in  setting  up  and \nmanaging it. The revolving fund is expected to cover operation and maintenance expenses, \nmanagement  and  administrative  costs,  and  potential  reinvestment  for  possible  expansion, \namong  other  things.  Specific  governance  structure,  administrative  arrangements,  selection \ncriteria, and uses of the funds, as well as their respective monitorable indicators, will be detailed \nin the consultant inception report for review and approval by ADB. \n \n20.  The TA final report will be disseminated to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy (2005). \n \n21.  The pilot facilities build under the TA will be turned over to the CBOs. The charter to \ncreate these CBOs will include provisions for owning and maintaining the facilities. An operation \nand maintenance agreement will be signed between the NEA and the CBOs at the time of the \nfacility  turnover.  All  training  materials  developed  by  the  consultants  and  office  equipment \npurchased  during  the  TA  will  be  transferred  to  the  NEA  upon  completion  of  the  TA  and \nthereafter will remain the property of the government. The copyright of any materials, software \nsystems, or databases developed by the TA consultants belongs to ADB and will remain with \nADB. The pilot installations built under the TA will be transferred to the CBOs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n22.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of the Philippines, to \nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Asian  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility for Rural Community-Based Renewable Energy Development in \nMindanao. \n \n \n                                                 \n10 The main microcredit financing institutions, among others, in Caraga are: Green Bank of Caraga, Peoples Bank of \nCaraga, Enterprise Bank, Talacogon Multipurpose Development Cooperative, Siargao Rural Bank and Rural Bank \nof Placer, Rural Bank of Cantilan and Socorro Empowered Cooperative \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nInvestments in  Successful replication  Department of Energy  Provision of \nrenewable energy  and scaling up of  and National  electricity through \nprojects in the  renewable energy for  Electrification  renewable energy \nPhilippines  rural electrification in the  Administration reports   sources will lead to \nPhilippines by 2015    broad economic \n    development in the \n    remote rural areas. \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nHouseholds in the  1,500 households    Annual project  The provision of \nCaraga region of  provided with electricity  implementation  electricity will result \nMindanao provided  by 200-kW renewable  reports and project  in improved \nwith  a business model  energy plants developed  completion reports  income-generation \nfor livelihood  and demonstrated by    opportunities for the \ndevelopment using  September 2013  Progress reports  target communities \nrenewable energy    submitted by   \n  50% of beneficiaries of  executing agencies  The targeted \n  productive use of energy    communities can \n  are women   CDM facility  afford the electricity \n  assessment reports  generated through \nPilot projects generate  and validation reports  renewable energy \nabout 200,000 kilowatt- to be prepared for  and grid expansion. \nhours per year from  subprojects during   \nemission-free,  project implementation  Pilot projects are \nrenewable energy, or    not delayed by \nreduction of about 100  Planned post-project  internal conflicts or \ntons of CO  emission  completion  security problems.  \n2\nper year  socioeconomic   \nsurveys   Risks \n   \nHuman and \nfinancial resources \nare limited \n \nResource risks due \nto weather and \nnatural disasters \n \nLocal communities \ndo not take \nownership of pilot \nprojects  \n  \nPilot projects do not \nsuccessfully identify \nsustainable delivery \nmodels and local \ncommunities do not \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \naccess new energy \nsources \n \nMaintenance of the \nmicrohydro plants is \nweak during \noperations, \nresulting in lower \noutput \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
