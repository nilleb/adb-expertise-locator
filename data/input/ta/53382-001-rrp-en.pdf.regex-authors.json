Investment Program Summary\nThe investment project will finance improvement of the Dhaka-Sylhet section of National Highway No. 2, with design features to\naddress the needs of the elderly, women, children, and the differently abled, and disaster and climate risks. The project road\nconnects to the border with India via the Sylhet-Tamabil section, and will improve the efficiency, connectivity, and safety of the\nDhaka-Sylhet trade corridor. The investment project will also assist the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in\nstrengthening its capacity for road safety and asset maintenance, in part through the attached transaction technical assistance.\nImpact: An efficient, sustainable, safe and regionally balanced transport system developed.\nOutcome: Mobility, safety, and regional trade along the Dhaka-Sylhet corridor road improved.\nOutputs: (i) The Dhaka-Sylhet corridor road upgraded with enhanced road safety, elderly, women, children, and differently\nabled- responsive, and climate- and disaster-resilient features,  and (ii) Institutional capacity of the Roads and Highways\nDepartment enhanced\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges will be the executing agency.\nProject Readiness: The project readiness is high; the complete scope to be financed by the multitranche financing facility has \nbeen appraised by ADB, and the impact of the prevailing pandemic on project preparation is insubstantial. The RHD completed \nthe detailed design in December 2020. The development project proposal was approved by the government in February 2021. \nEnvironmental and social due diligence have been completed for the entire alignment. To minimize start-up delays, the RHD \nhas been implementing preparatory activities for land acquisition since September 2019. Utility shifting is also underway with the\nbudget approved by the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, and advance funds transfers to utility corporations are \nanticipated to begin by September. Advance contracting is underway too and the RHD is targeting the award of the first \nADB-financed contract in December 2021.\n9.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the South Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Dhaka\u2013Sylhet Corridor Road Investment Project.1 \nThe report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening \nof the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) on Road Safety and Maintenance, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the TA and administration of the TA, as applicable.2 \n \n2.  The investment project will finance improvement of the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet section of National \nHighway No. 2 (N2), with design features to address the needs of the elderly, women, children, \nand the differently abled, and disaster and climate risks.3 The project road connects to the border \nwith India via the Sylhet\u2013Tamabil section, and will improve the efficiency, connectivity, and safety \nof  the  Dhaka\u2013Sylhet  trade  corridor.  The  investment  project  will  also  assist  the  RHD  in \nstrengthening its capacity for road safety and asset maintenance, in part through the attached \ntransaction  TA.  The  investment  project  and  the  transaction  TA  are  included  in  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023.4 \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \n3.  Development context. Growth and development in Bangladesh between 2000 and 2019 \nhave been significant. Annual economic growth has averaged 6.3%, poverty has been halved, \nand the country has become a key player in the global value chain for ready-made garments.5 \nBangladesh has a young, growing population, and given its location between South Asia and \nSoutheast Asia, it can develop into an economic powerhouse by expanding exports of labor-\nintensive goods. However, infrastructure deficiencies remain a key challenge to achieving this \ngoal. Poor transport infrastructure in particular raises costs, reduces competitiveness, and is a \nmajor barrier to expanding intraregional trade. \n \n4.  Road transport in Bangladesh. Road transport is Bangladesh\u2019s dominant mode, with a \nmodal share of over 70% of passenger traffic and 60% of freight traffic.6 Road traffic has grown \nat an average rate of over 6.6% per year between 2016 and 2020.7 The number of vehicles has \nincreased by 15% annually since 2015, reaching 4.4 million in 2020.8 The key challenges for \nBangladesh\u2019s  roads  are  limited  capacity,  deteriorating  condition,  missing  links  across  the \ncountry\u2019s many rivers, and a mixture of traffic of differing speeds.9 Globally, Bangladesh ranks \n100th out of 141 countries in terms of quality of its overall transport infrastructure, and 108th in \nthe quality of its roads,  lagging behind neighboring countries.10 The suboptimal quality of its road \nnetwork is affecting the country\u2019s logistics performance. Bangladesh ranks 100th out of 160 \n \n1  SASEC is a regional cooperation framework established in 2001. It comprises seven member countries (Bangladesh, \nBhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) and focuses on transport, trade facilitation, and energy. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been its secretariat since its establishment. \n2  Of the overall TA financing, (i) $1,000,000 will be provided by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7); \nand (ii) $2,000,000 will be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \n3  The 11.5-kilometer section from Ashuganj to Sarail is being constructed with assistance from Exim Bank of India, \nand is excluded from the scope. \n4  ADB. 2020.

In road quality, India ranks at 48, \nPakistan 67, the People\u2019s Republic of China 45, Sri Lanka 76, and Viet Nam 103. \n \n ", "2 \ncountries in the Logistics Performance Index, with an infrastructure indicator of 2.39, lower than \nthe country\u2019s overall average score of 2.58.11 Logistics service providers overwhelmingly point to \ninadequate road conditions and congestion as the main reasons for shipment delays within the \ncountry.12 \n \n5.  Road map. To maintain its middle-income country status, Bangladesh needs to continue \nits export-driven economic growth, which in turn demands an efficient, multimodal transport \nsystem, with roads as the centerpiece. The government aims to upgrade the country\u2019s national \nhighways to international standards, especially those forming part of subregional trade corridors \nand connecting major development and industry centers. This will lower logistics costs, increase \ncompetitiveness, and facilitate expansion of the country\u2019s production base.13 To meet this goal, \nBangladesh  needs  to  ensure  adequate  funding  and  address  constraints  in  planning, \nimplementation, and maintenance capacity. This will also demand holistic planning integrated with \nurban and industry development strategies. Formulation of a long-term strategy for sustainability \nof road assets is another priority. \n \n6.  Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor. Upgrading of the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor\u2014which forms the main \npart  of  N2  and  SASEC  Road  Corridor  No.  5\u2014has  been the  government\u2019s top  priority for \ncompleting the country\u2019s multimodal transport system.14 When complete, the corridor will open a \nnew trade route that connects the port city of Chattogram via Dhaka and Sylhet to the border with \nIndia\u2019s northeastern states through the three land ports of Akhaura, Sheola, and Tamabil, and \nthereby to Bhutan and Myanmar. It will also improve the connectivity of SASEC Corridor No. 2 \n(passing from Kolkata in India through Benapole) and SASEC Corridor No. 5 (connecting via \nDhaka to Sylhet). This will reduce congestion on the Dhaka\u2013Chattogram corridor on the National \nHighway No. 1 by allowing more goods, especially raw materials, to be imported via Tamabil and \ntransported along the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor. The wider economic impact of such improved \nconnectivity is estimated at about $134 million annually upon opening of the upgraded corridor, \nwith benefits that reach far beyond the immediate areas along the project road, and include most \nof Bangladesh and a large part of northeast India.15 \n \n7.  Economic and multimodal development. The Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor is the backbone \nof the planned Northeast Bangladesh Economic Corridor (NEBEC).16 The NEBEC is expected to \nconsolidate and promote key industries in northeast Bangladesh, such as energy generation and \nconstruction materials production, and better integrate these with economic centers elsewhere in \nBangladesh.17 This will help diversify the country\u2019s industrial base and equitably distribute export-\nled growth beyond the Dhaka\u2013Chattogram area. Multimodal transport planning is a key strategy \nfor NEBEC development, with the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet road as its spine; it fits well into the rail system, \nespecially the Dhaka\u2013Chattogram corridor, Chattogram port, and Matarbari port (which is under \ndevelopment).18 In combination with the Northeast Economic Corridor being prepared in India, \nthe NEBEC will help form an economic and urban agglomeration in the center of Asia.19 \n \n \n11 World Bank. 2019.

However, the existing Dhaka\u2012Sylhet road has only two lanes with no provision for slow-\nmoving and light traffic, leading to capacity constraints and significant safety risks. This has \nprevented the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor from meeting the need for a vital subregional trade corridor, \nor providing inclusive mobility to the poor and vulnerable living along the corridor. The situation is \nfurther  exacerbated  by  climate  change,  which  increases  flooding  risks,  particularly  in  the \nnortheastern wetland districts, where low-lying areas remain submerged for 4\u20136 months during \npre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. \n \n \n9.  Policy framework. The government has three main policy documents for the road sector.\nThe successive five-year plans have set forth the policy framework, strategies, and targets for \nrealizing the goal of becoming an upper middle-income country by 2031 and eradicating poverty \nby 2041.20 They recognize the importance of road transport as the core of an efficient multimodal \ntransport network to facilitate regional trade and promote industrial growth, and thereby sustain \nthe country\u2019s export-led growth. The Eighth Five Year Plan (2020\u20132025) continues the emphasis \nfrom  previous  plans  on  transformational  transport  projects  that  improve  mobility,  facilitate \ninternational trade, and improve implementation capacity of the RHD for timely completion of such \nroad projects and public\u2013private partnerships (PPP) to ease funding constraints.21 In terms of \nphysical investment, it places greater emphasis on improving heavily trafficked intercity corridors \nby widening these key roads. \n \n10.  The Road Master Plan (2009) serves as the priority 20-year investment program in the \nroad sector. 22 It aims to (i) preserve the RHD\u2019s road assets, (ii) develop a strategic and better \nconnected RHD road network to promote the country\u2019s economic growth, (iii) improve road safety, \nand (iv) strengthen the RHD\u2019s institutional capacity. The Road Master Plan formulated the Road \nSector Policy to realize these goals, and recommends (i) integrated planning; (ii) a higher priority \non road maintenance, including mainstreaming of routine maintenance; and (iii) better target-\nsetting for road conditions, controlling overloading, and improving road safety. The policy was \naccompanied by a list of proposed interventions, which were integrated into the successive 5-\nyear plans. \n \n11.  The National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy (2013) aims to improve the efficiency \nand  sustainability  of  transport  services  through  integrated  planning  to  contribute  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s goals of sustained economic growth and better integration with other priorities (e.g., \nthe environment, land use planning, and social services).23 The key implication for the road sector \nis a shift from continued investment in construction of many new roads to maintaining and using \nassets  effectively.  Specific  strategies to  achieve  this  include  prioritizing  road maintenance, \ncollecting user charges on select roads, and completing strategic capacity improvement works on \nmajor congestion points on the RHD network. \n \n12.  The RHD has improved the key national highways to enhance connectivity between \nDhaka and major economic centers such as Chattogram and the Padma Multipurpose Bridge. On \nthe SASEC Corridor No. 5, the government is upgrading (i) the Sylhet\u2013Tamabil section with \nassistance from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and (ii) the Ashuganj\u2013Sarail section \nwith assistance from the Exim Bank of India. This will connect to the Shillong\u2013Dawki section \nacross the Indian  border,  which  is  being  improved  with  help  from  the  Japan  International \n \n20 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2020.

With the support of ADB, the RHD introduced performance-based \nmaintenance contracts in 2012 to mobilize the private sector for efficient routine maintenance.24 \nSince 2019, the RHD has been strengthening the axle load control system by establishing 28 axle \nload control stations on its major highways nationwide, while also strengthening its institutional \ncapacity for enforcement.25 More resilient pavement material began being used on major national \nhighways in 2013. These interventions have reduced the proportion of RHD roads assessed as \npoor from 60% in 2011 to 19% in 2020.26 \n \n13.  Strategic  context.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20122020 \nemphasizes the following priority areas of investment: (i) easing infrastructure constraints by \nundertaking transformational investments in key sectors including transport; and (ii) promoting \neconomic  corridor  development  by  connecting  urban  growth  centers;  fostering  diversified \nindustrialization; and linking to national, regional, and global markets and supply chains.27 It also \nprioritizes deepening regional cooperation and integration to create new economic opportunities. \nThe MFF aligns well with these strategies by continuing ADB\u2019s engagement in the development \nof the key SASEC corridors and supporting the key transport infrastructure in the NEBEC. \n \n14.  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation.  The  ADB-supported  SASEC \nframework highlights transport and trade facilitation among its operational priorities. Since 2001, \nSASEC member countries have implemented 66 projects costing about $14.3 billion, including 43 \ntransport projects worth $11.4 billion. Its latest operational plan supports the government\u2019s vision \nfor increased trade and economic development by including the widening of the Dhaka\u2012Sylhet \nsection of the N2 in its priority transport projects (footnote 14). Under the SASEC program, ADB \nis also supporting the government\u2019s customs policy reform and trade and transport infrastructure \ndevelopment, including expanding the capacity of key land ports (e.g., Akhaura and Tamabil).28 \nThis  assistance  will  contribute  to  holistic  development  that  centers  on  strategic  trade  and \neconomic corridors. \n \n15.  Lessons. ADB has provided ongoing support to develop and upgrade Bangladesh\u2019s \nnational highway systems, including the key SASEC corridors. In 2012, ADB approved a $198 \nmillion loan for the SASEC Road Connectivity Project to improve the connectivity of the SASEC \nCorridor No. 2 by upgrading the two-lane road to a four-lane road with slow-moving vehicular \ntraffic (SMVT) service lanes on both sides (footnote 24). The SASEC Dhaka\u2013Northwest Corridor \nRoad Project, Phase 2, approved in 2017, is a multitranche financing facility in the amount of up \nto $1,200.0 million and will upgrade the remaining section of the corridor.29 Based on the \nimplementation of these projects, the following lessons have been incorporated in the design of \nthe MFF: (i) quality assurance of detailed designs including cost estimates; (ii) utilization of \nadvance  contracting  and  safeguard  actions  to  minimize  start-up  delays;  (iii)  long-term \nengagement for institutional reforms; and (iv) support for safeguards actions. \n \n24 ADB. 2012.

Prolonged border closures and domestic travel restrictions \nassociated with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have affected the poor and \nvulnerable, who often depend on mobility for survival, traveling, and operating businesses along \nmajor roads such as the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor.31 Providing safe mobility options will be critical \nfor assisting these people in recovering their means of living and curtailing the impact of the \npandemic on those who have been most affected. The investment project will contribute to this \ngoal by improving the key national highway for better access to schools, hospitals, workplaces, \nand commercial sites. It will also provide community awareness-raising programs on prevention \nof communicable diseases including COVID-19. It is aligned with the government\u2019s direction to \nopen the economy to avoid sustained damage to livelihoods.

THE INVESTMENT PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The investment project is aligned with the following impact: an efficient, sustainable, safe, \nand regionally balanced transport system developed (footnote 21). The investment project will \nhave the following outcome: mobility, safety, and regional trade along the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor \nimproved.32 \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n19.  Output 1: The Dhaka\u2013Sylhet corridor road upgraded with enhanced road safety; \nelderly, women, children, and differently abled responsive; and climate- and disaster-\nresilient features. 33 The investment project will help finance construction works for widening \nabout 210 kilometers (km) of the existing two-lane road on N2 to a four-lane road with SMVT \nlanes. The widened road\u2019s design features include 60 km of footpaths, 26 footbridges, and at least \n40 public education campaign signages and/or billboards to raise awareness on road safety, \nCOVID-19, human trafficking, and social inclusiveness. \n \n20.  Output 2: Institutional capacity of the Roads and Highways Department enhanced. \nTo ensure the safety and sustainability of its rapidly expanding road network, the investment \nproject will help strengthen the RHD\u2019s institutional capacity in (i) road safety by (a) introducing a \nnew accident data collection system, (b) formulating a road safety road map including an \nimproved road safety audit and/or inspection program, (c) enhancing safety works, and (d) \nprocuring safety equipment; (ii) road maintenance by (a) introducing a road maintenance needs \nassessment tool, (b) reforming the maintenance funds budgeting framework, (c) formulating a life \ncycle cost-based maintenance strategy, (d) designing and piloting new maintenance solutions, \nand (e) procuring maintenance equipment; and (iii) gender equality and social inclusion (GESI)  \nby (a) developing manuals and/or guidelines for GESI-responsive and climate- and disaster-\nresilient road designs, and (b) developing a GESI strategy.34 \n \n21.  Finance-plus and value added by ADB assistance. The investment project will allow \nADB to continue its support to improve the key subregional trade corridors in Bangladesh. ADB \nwill assist with institutional reforms of the RHD, thereby scaling up the project outcome to the \nRHD\u2019s entire road network. ADB support will ensure attention is given to the following critical \nareas: \n(i)  Facilitating  regional  cooperation  through  strategic  development \ncoordination. ADB will lead the flagship regional cooperation and integration \ninitiative by taking up the last and the longest section of SASEC Corridor No. 5 in \ncollaboration with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, JICA, and the Exim \nBank of India. \n(ii)  Contributing to inclusive spatial development of Bangladesh. The MFF will \nhelp distribute the growth concentrated along the Dhaka\u2013Chattogram corridor to \nthe rest of the country by promoting the NEBEC and improving the connectivity of \nthe north\u2013south and the east\u2013west axes of the RHD\u2019s road network. \n \n32 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n33 Examples of features meeting the needs of the elderly, women, children, and the differently abled include walkways, \nroadside green space, safe crossings, speed bumps, road safety signs for pedestrians, and adequate street lighting. \n34 Under output 2, the attached transaction TA will finance activities (i) (a)\u2013(b), (ii) (a)\u2013(c), and (iii), while the MFF will \nfinance the rest of the activities. \n \n ", "7 \n(iii)  Mainstreaming road safety. ADB will support making road safety an integral part \nof the RHD\u2019s operations, including accident data collection and management, and \nthe design, construction, and monitoring of safe roads.35 \n(iv)  Supporting sustainability. ADB will help the RHD complete reforms to its road \nmaintenance framework by improving its maintenance budget programming and \npiloting new maintenance solutions.36 ADB will also support the government\u2019s \nplans for future tolling on the project road with studies on tolling strategies and \nother measures, in concert with the progress on the infrastructure elements of the \ninvestment project. \n(v)  High-level technology. The investment project will help pilot the use of drones to \nmonitor safeguard activities and construction.37 This will contribute to safe and \nefficient implementation of the linear project under the pandemic. \n \n22.  Public\u2013private partnership initiatives. Bangladesh\u2019s road transport subsector has had \nrelatively limited progress with PPPs because of its capital-intensive nature; slow, large-scale land \nacquisition; uncertain ridership and limited affordability; and limited government support and/or \nguarantee.38 Notwithstanding, the current five-year plan (footnote 21) stresses the critical role \nPPPs play in ensuring long-term sustainability of the country\u2019s road network. This was further \nechoed by the recent government directive for collecting tolls on major highways.39 The primary \nmodel considered by the RHD is an operate, manage, and toll model, introducing private sector \nparticipation through an affordable toll structure. Therefore, the RHD is pursuing the following \ninitiatives:  (i)  preparing  an  institutional  restructuring  plan  that  includes  establishment  of  a \ndedicated PPP office by 2022, (ii) procuring an advisory service to identify future PPP projects, \nand (iii) recruiting a consultant to design a comprehensive toll collection system. The MFF \nsupports these initiatives by including provisions for constructing two toll collection stations in the \nconstruction contracts and financing a consulting service for studies on suitable toll and operate \nmodalities for the project road. The construction contracts also incorporate 6-year performance-\nbased maintenance as part of PPP initiatives. \n \n23.  Use of a multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nachieve the outcome.40 The investment project will be financed by an MFF with four tranches that \nadopts the time-slice approach for large-scale stand-alone projects. During MFF processing the \ndesign, procurement, and safeguards were appraised for the entire investment project. Each \ntranche will finance slices of a group of contracts following the indicative tranche schedule, and \nthe amount of each tranche will be requested following the disbursement progress and projection. \nThe tranche schedule is based on the disbursement projection. In addition to increasing the \ncapacity of the country\u2019s critical subregional trade corridor, the investment project will support \ninstitutional reforms of the RHD for enhanced road safety and maintenance. ADB\u2019s long-term \ninvolvement through an MFF can help ensure that these reforms are sustainable and that good \npractices from the investment project are applied to other road projects in Bangladesh. In line with \n \nrecommendations  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department  on  designing  MFFs, the \n \n35 Equipment to be procured includes speed detectors, traffic signals, and accident-response vehicles. Additional safety \nworks include safety barriers, road marking, and signage. \n36 The investment project includes provisions for construction of two toll collection stations, and will collaborate with a \nnew $500 million policy-based loan project being prepared by ADB\u2019s South Asia Department that includes policy \nactions to ensure adequate allocation of funds for operation and maintenance of completed investments. The \nproposed loan is included in ADB\u2019s COBP for Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023 (footnote 4). \n37 Provision of dedicated consultancy services for procurement and effective use of drones will be considered by the \ngovernment  through  ADB.  2019.

The climate change impact is assessed as high, with flooding, cyclones, and increased\nmean temperature and temperature extremes identified as major risks. Most of the project area\nare exposed to flooding and inundation, highlighting the importance of adaptation and risk-\nreduction measures such as increased embankment height in critical portions, improvement in\nbridge design, and increased linear and cross-drainage capacities. The use of polymer modified\nbitumen (PMB) increases resilience of the road to temperature extremes. Climate adaptation is\nestimated to cost $363.3 million under the investment project. ADB will finance 83.8% ($304.6\nmillion) of the adaptation costs and the remainder will be financed by the government.42\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n29. The Road Transport and Highways Division, Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges\n(MORTB) will be the executing agency and the RHD under the MORTB is the implementing\nagency for the investment project. A dedicated project implementation unit (PIU) was established\nin March 2021. The RHD will also engage a group of individual consultants using proceeds from\nthe proposed loans to support the PIU, especially in implementing and monitoring safeguards,\nthe GESI action plan, and compliance with health and safety protocols. A project implementation\nconsultant will be engaged by the RHD to support overall project management. Consultants, partly\nfinanced through the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, will support the RHD in implementing\noutput 2. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail,\nincluding specific arrangements for project 1, in the facility administration manual (FAM).43\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nMFF availability period  June 2021\u2013June 2031 \nEstimated completion  Tranche 1: March 2024, MFF: March 2030 \ndate \nManagement \n(i) Executing agency Road Transport and Highways Division, MORTB \n(ii) Implementing RHD \nagency\n(iii) Implementation Head office of the project implementation unit at the RHD headquarters in Dhaka, and six \nunit project site offices with 51 staff proposed \nProcurement  OCB international  14 contracts  $1,848,052,430 \nRFQ  8 contracts  $2,688,951 \nConsulting services  Project implementation  International consultants: 303 person-  $32,015,731 \nconsultant (QCBS, 90:10)  months \n42 Climate Change Assessment with the attached Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n43 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Project readiness. The project readiness is high; the complete scope to be financed by \nthe MFF has been appraised by ADB, and the impact of the prevailing pandemic on project \npreparation is insubstantial. The RHD completed the detailed design in December 2020. The \ndevelopment project proposal was approved by the government in February 2021. Environmental \nand social due diligence have been completed for the entire alignment. To minimize start-up \ndelays,  the  RHD  has  been  implementing  preparatory  activities  for  land  acquisition  since \nSeptember 2019. Utility shifting is also underway with the budget approved by the MORTB, and \nadvance funds transfers to utility corporations are anticipated to begin by September. Advance \ncontracting is underway too and the RHD is targeting the award of the first ADB-financed contract \nin December 2021. \n \nIV.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n31.  The transaction TA for Institutional Strengthening of Roads and Highways Department on \nRoad Safety and Maintenance will assist the government in undertaking the activities under output \n2 for enhancing the RHD\u2019s capacity in (i) road safety by (a) introducing an accident data collection \nsystem, and (b) formulating a road safety road map, including an improved road safety audit \nand/or  inspection  program;  (ii)  road  maintenance  by  (a)  introducing  a  maintenance  needs \nassessment tool, and (b) formulating a life cycle cost-based maintenance strategy, (c) formulating \na life cycle cost-based maintenance strategy; and (iii) mainstreaming GESI by (a) developing \nmanuals and/or guidelines for GESI-responsive and climate- and disaster-resilient road designs, \nand (b) developing a GESI strategy. The RHD is the TA implementing agency. The transaction \nTA is estimated to cost $3,250,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and additional $1,000,000 on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The government will provide counterpart support in the form \nof counterpart staff, data, reports, and other in-kind contributions. The value of government \ncontribution is estimated to account for 7.7% of the total TA cost. ADB will engage consulting \nfirms and individual consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). The details of the transaction TA are in the attached TA report.44 \n \n \n44 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "11 \nV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n32.  The engineering designs are being optimized for economy, construction efficiency, road \nsafety, and social inclusiveness following applicable international and national design standards. \nTo increase resilience against overloading and extreme weather conditions such as severe heat \nand high precipitation, polymer modified bitumen will be used as the pavement material.45 A \nclimate risk and vulnerability assessment was prepared for the investment project. Climate \nchange risks have been addressed in the project design by (i) increased embankment height in \ncritical portions, (ii) improved bridge designs, (iii) increased linear and cross drainage capacities, \nand (iv) the use of PMB for increasing resilience to temperature extremes (para. 28). The \ncontracts will incorporate performance-based maintenance for 6 years as part of PPP initiatives.46 \nThe  project  implementation  consultant  will  conduct  road  safety  audits  during  the  design, \nconstruction, and maintenance stages. The construction cost estimates were reviewed in detail, \nand confirmed as responsive to the design necessitated by the project-specific requirements.47 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis was carried out by comparing the societal \ncost of transportation with and without the project, taking into consideration the benefits of \nimproved levels of service on the project road sections. The project benefits will include reduced \nvehicle operating costs, travel time, and road accidents; and increased trade and other economic \nactivities. The economic internal rate of return, taking into consideration vehicle operating cost \nand travel time savings, is estimated at 14.2%, indicating that the investment is economically \nviable. A sensitivity analysis testing the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from \nchanges in the key parameters that determine the project costs and benefits indicated that the \nlevel of economic viability remained satisfactory. Furthermore, the investment project is expected \nto generate wider economic benefits in many other districts of Bangladesh beyond Dhaka or \nSylhet  as  well  as  in  the  northeast  region  in  India,  demonstrating  its  potential  as  a  major \nsubregional route, offering alternatives to the existing trade routes via Southwest Bangladesh and \nChattogram (footnote 15). \n \n34.  Financial sustainability. The investment project will be implemented with performance-\nbased maintenance included in the contract for an extended period of 6 years after construction. \nThe government has substantially increased the allocation for maintenance from $88 million in \nfiscal year (FY) 2016 to $125 million in FY2020 for national highways. As a result, the proportion \nof roads in good to fair condition increased from 40% to 63% in that period. The average per km \nactual expenditure for national highways under RHD maintenance budget amounted to $27,957 \nduring FY2016\u2013FY2020. Upon completion of performance-based maintenance under the project, \nrecurrent costs associated with the project road sections are estimated to be $12,482 per km \nannually. The performance-based maintenance included in the construction contracts will support \nincreased efficiency in routine maintenance through the engagement of the private sector in the \ninitial  years  upon  construction.  Furthermore,  the  use  of  PMB  for  pavements  will  increase \nresilience of the project road to heavier traffic, overloading, and extreme temperature, and result \nin longer intervals between periodic maintenance. The annual maintenance budget requirement \n \n45 Although introduced recently in Bangladesh, polymer modified bitumen has been widely used globally (e.g., in India, \nJapan, and the United States), and proven technically sound; the technical standards and specifications are readily \navailable. \n46 The term public\u2013private partnership here refers to a range of possible relationships among public and private entities \nin the context of infrastructure and other services. \n47 Due Diligence for the Construction Cost Estimate (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "12 \nestimated for the project road is less than 2% of RHD\u2019s average maintenance expenditure on \nnational highways during FY2016\u2013FY2020. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that adequate \nfunds will be available to meet the maintenance requirements. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n35.  Financial management. The financial management assessment was prepared following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Financial Analysis and Evaluation, Financial Management Assessment, and \nrelated technical guidance notes.48 The RHD is implementing ongoing ADB-funded projects, and \nhas established accounting, reporting, and budgeting procedures in place in line with government \nregulations. Based on the assessment, the key financial management risks identified prior to \nmitigation are (i) manual consolidation of financial records and preparation of project financial \nstatements,  (ii)  lack  of  internal  audit  arrangements  at  the  RHD,  and  (iii)  vacant  financial \nmanagement positions at the PIU and project management offices. Overall, the pre-mitigation risk \nof  the  RHD  is  substantial.  The  RHD  has  agreed  to  implement  a  comprehensive  financial \nmanagement action plan to address the deficiencies. Key mitigating measures agreed with the \nRHD and included in the financial management action plan are (i) implementing basic accounting \nand financial reporting software  for the project; (ii) outsourcing internal audit; (iii) training on ADB \nfinancial management; (iv) hiring of a financial management expert; and (v) developing a manual \nto provide guidance on ADB requirements and accounting software implementation. Details of \nrisks and key mitigating measures are in the FAM (footnote 43). \n \n36.  Procurement. The project procurement risk is rated moderate. The RHD has experienced \nsignificant delays in procurement and consultant recruitment in projects previously funded by \nADB. This is the first project for which the RHD will implement procurement following the ADB \nProcurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers. The potential impact of the \npandemic could increase uncertainties related to procurement activities. Nonetheless, the RHD \nhas  considerable  experience  in  implementing  projects  funded  by  bilateral  and  multilateral \ninstitutions. To better prepare for the heightened risks, strategic procurement planning was \nconducted. Value for money will be secured through (i) the use of new pavement material, (ii) a \nrisk-managed approach for choice of appropriate procurement methods and optimal contract \npackage sizes, (iii) adoption of evaluation criteria for multiple package award status under the \ninvestment project, and (iv) prior review of all major packages. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the RHD. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  Poverty. In 2016, poverty rates in the districts crossed by the road are 21%\u201330%, \ncompared to the national average of 24%, with the main sources of income being business, day \nlabor, and agriculture. The investment project aims to strengthen Bangladesh\u2019s domestic and \ninternational trade with neighboring countries; enhance transport facilities between Dhaka and \nSylhet and adjacent areas; and provide easier access to larger markets and social services and/or \nfacilities such as markets, health facilities, schools, and workplaces. Jobs generated during the \nconstruction and maintenance stages could help increase household incomes, and contribute to \npoverty reduction. \n \n38.  Social.  Road  safety  remains  a  major  challenge,  with  pedestrians,  bicyclists,  and \nmotorcyclists accounting for 80% of fatalities. The investment project is expected to reduce road \naccidents and fatalities through the inclusion of key safety design features, notably SMVT lanes \n \n48 ADB. 2019. Financial Analysis and Evaluation: Technical Guidance Note. Manila.  \n \n ", "13 \nand footbridges for pedestrians. The investment project\u2019s key beneficiaries are the estimated 6.7 \nmillion residents in the districts, as well as businesses, particularly those in the trade sector.49 \n \n39.  Gender equality and social inclusion. The investment project is classified effective \ngender mainstreaming. The socioeconomic survey reveals that women in the project area work \nin garment factories and with home-based hand looms, dying, poultry farms, and other factories \nand agricultural occupations. Focus group discussions indicate that the roads are not easily \naccessible for women, the elderly, differently abled, and children, who must commute daily to \nschools, markets, places of work, and hospitals. The survey identified the 691 households headed \nby women (7.75%) among the 8,905 affected households as vulnerable and entitled to cash \ngrants. \n \n40.  A GESI action plan that integrates activities with the project design includes (i) GESI- \nresponsive road designs (e.g., SMVT lanes, footbridges, footpaths, and adequate lighting); (ii) \nconsultations with community members (including at least 30% women and vulnerable groups) \nfor confirmation of locations of various gender-responsive facilities; (iii) an average of 10% of \nskilled and unskilled labor days generated from the civil works filled by women; (iv) orientations \non core labor standards with all eligible project staff; (v) community awareness and prevention \norientation (at least 30% of participants to be women) on road safety, gender-based violence, \nsexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases (including COVID-19); \n(vi) RHD staff training on gender, COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, avoidance of sexual \nharassment and exploitation, and climate and disaster resilience in road design (including 90% of \nall relevant women staff); (vii) development of guidelines for GESI-responsive and climate- and \ndisaster-resilient road design; and (viii) formulation of a draft GESI strategy for the RHD. 50 \n \n41.  Sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking. Bangladesh has a low HIV \nprevalence rate (0.7% reported among high-risk groups) but remains an important source of \ninternal and cross-border human trafficking. The investment project is not expected to contribute \nto an increase in HIV incidence or human trafficking because it is expanding an existing corridor. \nIt will provide benefits to local people, including women, by engaging them in consultation \nmeetings, employment in civil works, and awareness-raising training on HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking prevention for project implementers (including 30% women). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n42.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nof project 1 are as follows.51 \n \n43.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination has been prepared for \nthe entire alignment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and satisfying the \nEnvironmental  Conservation  Rules,  1997  of  the  Government  of  Bangladesh,  where  the \ninvestment project falls under the red category.52 An environmental assessment and review \nframework has also been prepared. The assessment concluded no significant, unprecedented, \nor irreversible impacts. The alignment does not pass through and is not located near any protected \n \n49 Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.

Most of the potential significant \nimpacts (e.g., transportation, storage, and handling of large volumes of construction materials; \nincreased  levels  of  air  pollutants,  noise,  and  vibration;  management  of  construction  and \ndemolition waste; siltation of waterways; and traffic obstruction near active construction sites) are \nreversible,  largely  limited  to the  construction  period,  and mostly  localized,  and  are readily \nmitigated with no or minimal residual impacts.54 \n \n44.  Environmental management plans with accompanying environmental monitoring plans \nhave been prepared for each package. The investment project will support the engagement of (i) \ntwo environmental safeguards specialists to support the PIU in implementing environmental \nsafeguards, and (ii) a health and safety expert to advise on and monitor the implementation of \nhealth and safety plans. Overall environment safeguards compliance will be validated by an \nexternal monitor who will conduct third party monitoring and submit independent semiannual \nmonitoring reports. The PIU will also submit semiannual monitoring reports during construction \nand annual monitoring reports during operation until the facility completion report is prepared. \n \n45.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). A draft resettlement plan has been prepared by \nthe RHD for the entire Dhaka\u2013Sylhet section of the N2.55 A total of 583 hectares of private land \nwill need to be acquired, entailing the following impacts: 9,286 affected households, units, and/or \nentities (55,454 persons), including 8,905 households, 302 common property resources, 56 \ngovernment  offices,  21  RHD-owned  structures, and 2  nongovernment  organizations  and/or \nassociation structures. Of the 7,079 households affected by physical displacement, about 4,679 \nare  titleholders,  2,060  are  non-titleholders,  and  340  are  encroachments.  Ten  stakeholder \nconsultation meetings, 61 focus group discussions, and many small group meetings (some virtual) \nwere conducted from October 2019 to April 2021. The involuntary resettlement impacts were \nadequately assessed, and corresponding mitigating measures were stipulated in the resettlement \nplan. The RHD is found to have adequate capacity to implement the resettlement plan. \n \n46.  The investment project will support the engagement of six individual national social \nsafeguards experts under the PIU to enable dedicated facilitation for works packages with \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts and to ensure that continuing public consultations are carried \nout with affected people and all stakeholders consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements. Overall  environment  safeguards compliance  will  be  validated  by  an  external \nmonitor who will conduct third party monitoring. \n \n47.  Indigenous peoples (category C). 56 The investment project does not affect tribal lands, \nand the survey confirmed that no indigenous communities, as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, are affected. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n48.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.57 \n \n \n53 About 169 km of the project road passes within a vulture safe zone, a 200-km wide zero-tolerance zone for vulture-\ntoxic drugs such as diclofenac for the critically endangered white-rumped vulture, Gyps bengalensis. A critical habitat \nassessment has concluded there will be no significant adverse impacts on this and other threatened species. \n54 Additional tree plantations are proposed in addition to the regulatory requirement to enhance the micro climate and \nserve as a carbon sink. \n55 This excludes the 11.5-km section to be funded by the Exim Bank of India based on the draft design of the alignment. \n56 The term \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d shall be used interchangeably with the term tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and \ncommunities as per the Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh.  \n57 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "15 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nProject implementation delay because of  Advance actions are being taken to ensure high project readiness, \nprolonged procurement and contract  with the objective of awarding contracts shortly after loan \nvariation, and land acquisition and  effectiveness.
