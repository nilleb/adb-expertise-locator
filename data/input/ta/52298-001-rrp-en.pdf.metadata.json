THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Maharashtra State Road Improvement Project. \n \n2.  Project  summary.  The  Government  of  India  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the improvement of state highways and major district roads \nin Maharashtra. The project will upgrade and maintain about 450 kilometers (km) of state roads \nforming part of the core road network (CRN) in Maharashtra, which will enhance transport \naccessibility and efficiency, and improve the sustainability of the road network, in line with the \nstate\u2019s Road Development Plan 2001\u20132021.1 It will involve upgrading of state roads to two-lane \nstandard and performance-based maintenance contracts to maintain the improved road assets \nfor 5 years after construction. It also includes initiatives to build institutional capacity within the \nMaharashtra Public Works Department (MPWD), the project executing agency, focusing on \nstrengthened sustainability and road safety practices. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  State context. The state of Maharashtra is located in central and western India and \nborders the states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Madhya \nPradesh. With an area of about 0.3 million square km (9.4% of India\u2019s total), it is India\u2019s third-\nlargest state. It is also India\u2019s second-most populous state, with 122.9 million people,2 which is \nforecast to increase to 125.7 million by 2031.3 The major cities are Amravati, Aurangabad, \nKolhapur, Mumbai, Nagpur, Nasik, Pune, Ratnagiri, Sangli, Solapur, and Thane. \n \n4.  Road transport context. Maharashtra\u2019s extensive road network totals about 303,350 km, \nand includes national highways (12,275 km), state highways (34,450 km), and district roads \n(110,750 km). The state\u2019s economic growth has generated significant passenger and freight traffic \ndemand. There were 31.4 million registered vehicles in Maharashtra in 2018, having increased at \na compound annual growth rate of 9% since 2001.4 The average annual daily traffic on the state \nhighways is currently 8,000 equivalent passenger car units per day, and traffic volumes are \nexpected to continue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 5%. The MPWD is the \nmain  institution  responsible  for  development  and  maintenance  of  national  highways,  state \nhighways, major district roads, and bridges in Maharashtra. Other district roads and rural roads \nare managed by the Rural Roads Department.5 \n \n5.  Development need. The key development challenge for Maharashtra is translating the \nstate\u2019s economic growth into more balanced development throughout the state\u2019s rural areas. The \nHuman Development Index (HDI) and per capita income levels vary greatly across the districts in \nthe state; rural areas away from Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, and Thane are experiencing slow \neconomic  growth,  which  is  reflected  by  lower  relative  HDI  and  per  capita  income  values. \n \n1  Government of Maharashtra, Public Works Department. 2012.

In contrast, the contributions made by the industrial and service sectors to the state\u2019s \neconomy are expanding. Growth and development outside of the state\u2019s major urban centers \nmust be promoted by connecting agricultural and industrial areas to markets and connecting rural \nareas to second-tier cities and towns. This will provide opportunities for livelihood outside of the \nagriculture sector, particularly for women. \n \n6.  Road transport needs and issues. Road transport is critical to accessibility, mobility, and \nconnectivity of rural communities in Maharashtra, particularly for accessing markets, employment \nopportunities, and services beyond the agriculture sector. The core development problem is that \nroads connecting rural areas and urban centers are congested, unsafe, and of poor quality. This \nproblem is caused by the inadequate carrying capacity of the state highway and major district \nroad network; deteriorating road assets; and poor planning and implementation for road safety. \nNearly 80% of state highways and major district roads in Maharashtra are either single-lane or \nintermediate-lane standard, while 68% of state highways are in average to very poor condition \nwith a roughness index of 3,000 according to the Indian Road Congress standard, highlighting \nthe need for better road asset maintenance planning. 8  In 2018, Maharashtra reported 35,717 \nroad accidents (7.6% of India\u2019s total), including 13,261 fatalities (8.8% of India\u2019s total), an 8.1% \nincrease in the number of fatalities in comparison to 2017.9 This project will help the government \naddress the need for (i) increased road capacity; (ii) improved road asset management planning; \nand (iii) better road safety, especially for women and other vulnerable groups. \n \n7.  Government\u2019s plans for road transport. The Government of Maharashtra, through the \nMPWD, is implementing a road network development plan, with the objectives of improving state \nroads  connecting  industrial,  tourist,  religious,  and  district  headquarters  to  two-lane  roads; \nconnecting villages with all-weather roads; and expanding the overall length of Maharashtra\u2019s \nroad network to 336,994 km (footnote 1). In 2016, the MPWD undertook a review to identify a \nCRN of roughly 18,000 km of state highways and major district roads for development in phases. \nBased on the CRN review, about 450 km of high-priority roads were identified. \n \n8.  Alignment with strategic objectives. This lending proposal  aligns with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, which emphasizes boosting economic competitiveness \nto create more and better jobs; providing inclusive access to infrastructure networks and services; \naddressing climate change and increasing climate resilience; and building greater institutional \ncapacities.10  The  project  contributes  to  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  by  (i) \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability;  (iv)  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security;  and  (v) \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.

Lessons from previous ADB assistance in the road transport subsector. Lessons \nfrom previous road transport projects, such as the Chhattisgarh Road Connectivity Project and \nRajasthan State Highway Investment Program, and sector assessments in India highlight the \nneed for (i) a longer-term maintenance planning horizon, (ii) stronger attention to road safety, (iii) \nbetter monitoring of project outcomes and impacts, and (iv) analysis of the needs of the executing \nagency to ensure realistic project implementation timeframes.12 This project\u2019s design is informed \nby these lessons. With support from a project management services (PMS) consultant, the new \nexecuting agency\u2019s capacity for road maintenance planning and road safety auditing will be \nimproved, and a project performance monitoring system will be developed and implemented. The \nPMS consultant will provide capacity support to the MPWD throughout project implementation in \nsocial, gender, and environmental safeguards implementation, as well as financial management. \nADB has also provided a series of focused safeguards and gender training workshops to the \nexecuting agency during due diligence.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: connectivity between industrial areas, \nagricultural areas, administrative headquarters, and economic centers of Maharashtra enhanced \n(footnote 1). The project will have the following outcome: transport accessibility, efficiency, \nsustainability, and safety of the CRN in Maharashtra improved.13 \n \n11.  Output  1:  State  highways  and major  district  roads  of the  CRN  upgraded  and \nmaintained. The project will (i) upgrade about 25 km of major district roads and 425 km of state \nhighways  with  climate change  adaptation  features; (ii)  commence  road maintenance  using \nperformance-based contracts for 450 km of roads; and (iii) install road safety features friendly to \nthe elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities at appropriate locations. \n \n12.  Output 2: Capacity in road safety and maintenance increased. The loan will finance \n(i) development and adoption of a maintenance planning methodology for the project roads and \nother CRN roads; (ii) piloting and establishment of a systematic approach to road safety audits \nfor 200 km of state highways; (iii) training in climate change adaptation and disaster-resilient \nfeatures applicable to road design for MPWD project staff, including women staff; (iv) training in \nroad safety auditing, for MWD project staff, including for women staff; and (v) increased road \nsafety awareness among contractors\u2019 personnel, including women personnel. \n \n13.  Roads selected for ADB assistance. This project aims to upgrade priority roads that \nform part of the CRN\u201411 state highways and 2 major district roads to benefit 7 districts in \nMaharashtra. Roads were prioritized systematically using criteria that include (i) population \nserved; (ii) connectivity to national highways, other state highways and interstate roads, sea ports, \nairports,  and  major  rail  hubs;  (iii)  connectivity  to  industrial  areas,  enterprise  clusters,  and \nagricultural areas; (iv) existing traffic volumes; (v) existing road width; (vi) economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR); and (vii) land, environment, and social impacts. The state roads selected will \nimprove  accessibility  and  safety  in  districts  with  relatively  lower  HDI  scores  (Amravati, \nOsmanabad, Washim, Yavatmal), as well as areas with heavy reliance on the agriculture sector \n \n11 ADB. 2019.

In Ratnagiri, the targeted road upgrades to state highways and one major district road will \nimprove access to the national highways from Mumbai to Goa and Mumbai to Kolhapur, which \nconnect to the neighboring state of Karnataka. Access will also be enhanced to markets for \nhorticulture products as well as to new employment opportunities in the tourism and new power \ngeneration projects. In northern Akola and eastern Amravati, upgrades to the selected state \nhighways and major district road will improve connectivity between rural areas and administrative \nheadquarters and the major strategic national highway from Mumbai to Kolkata via Nagpur, as \nwell as to national highways connecting to the adjacent state of Madhya Pradesh. In Yavatmal, \nconnectivity will be enhanced to the national highway connecting Washim to the Mumbai\u2013Kolkata \nstrategic national highway and to the state of Telangana to the south. In Solapur, the upgrades to \ntwo state highways will enhance connectivity between industrial areas and the national highway \nfrom Solapur to Pune, as well as to national highways connecting to Telangana. Overall, the \nselected road improvements will enhance employment opportunities and help reduce poverty in \nrural  areas  of  Maharashtra  by  providing  more  efficient  and  safe  connections  to  important \nadministrative headquarters (Amravati, Ratnagiri, and Solapur) and the state\u2019s major economic \ncenters (Mumbai, Nagpur, Nashik, and Pune). Additional priority roads forming part of the CRN \nin Maharashtra are planned as a subsequent project for ADB\u2019s assistance.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n15.  ADB has extensive experience in road transport projects across India at the national and \nstate levels. This project is the first proposed ADB financing for the development of state highways \nand  major  district  roads  in  Maharashtra  and  complements  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  assistance  in \nMaharashtra to  improve  2,100 km  of rural  roads.14  ADB  is currently  coordinating  with the \nGovernment of India, through the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, to strengthen road \nsafety through a state road incentive program. That program excludes infrastructure components \nand focuses on institutional aspects, accident response and monitoring systems, vehicle fitness \nand awareness campaigns. This project\u2019s scope complements the state road incentive program \nthrough  infrastructure  improvements  relating  to  road  safety.  Through  this  project,  road \nmaintenance planning and road safety within the new executing agency will be updated to include \nlatest best practices and formalized through systematic methodologies. All civil works contracts \nencourage  private  sector  involvement  by  including  5-year  performance-based  maintenance \nobligations to improve asset quality and service levels. An overall road maintenance strategy and \nplan will be defined for the project roads once the 5-year performance-based maintenance period \nis over. A tool kit and road safety audit framework will be developed alongside hands-on training \nin road safety auditing. Knowledge-sharing events will benefit officials, contractors, consultants, \nMPWD staff, and other stakeholders. The project will also implement women-specific initiatives \nsuch as health camps at different communities along the project roads. Bus shelters will include \nsolar lighting, empowerment messages for women, and helpline numbers for women-specific \nschemes. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.

Climate adaptation and finance. The climate change impact on the project is assessed \nas medium. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment indicated an increased risk of extreme \ntemperatures and increased rainfall because of climate change.16 High temperatures and heat \n \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nwaves impact road pavement integrity, causing surface failures, including cracking, raveling, \npotholes, and ruts. The pavement design has adopted the use of viscosity-graded VG-30 paving \nbitumen in lieu of the earlier grade used in most state roads in India. This heavier duty bitumen \npavement will tolerate significant traffic loads and distress induced by higher temperatures. \nExtreme rainfall is projected to increase in all districts of Maharashtra, with the greatest increases \nin the northern areas. Drainage will be resized and improved to cope with higher flooding \nfrequency and to provide higher discharge capacities. Roads will also be raised by about 0.3 \nmeters. Road embankments will be raised in critical sections to prevent water stagnation and \nflooding impacts. Climate change adaptation measures are estimated to cost about $16.79 \nmillion. ADB will finance 76.0% of adaptation costs. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The project will be implemented by the MPWD through the project management unit \n(PMU) and project implementation unit (PIU) field offices for civil works contract packages. The \nMPWD will also engage consulting firms to be the authority engineers for the works contracts, \nand a PMS consultant to support project implementation. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2020\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Government of Maharashtra, Public Works Department \n(ii)  Key implementing agency  Project management unit in the Public Works Department, \nGovernment of Maharashtra  \n(iii) Implementation unit  Project implementation unit in the Public Works Department, \nGovernment of Maharashtra, about 45 staffa \nProcurement  Open competitive  Nine contracts  $183.31 million \nbidding (nationally \nadvertised) \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- Three contracts for  $9.57 million \nbased selection;  authority engineer and \nfull technical  project management \nproposal  services \n2,545 person-months \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing of eligible works and consulting services \nadvance contracting  expenditures, incurred before loan effectiveness but within 12 \nmonths prior to loan signing, up to 20% of the loan amount; advance \ncontracting for recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil \nworks. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote: The performance-based maintenance contracts will commence during the implementation period and extend \nbeyond the estimated loan closing date.

Technical \n \n22.  The project was assessed as technically viable. The MPWD prepared and approved the \nengineering design of the proposed project roads during project preparation. The engineering \ndesign  follows  applicable  criteria  in  line  with  Indian  Roads  Congress  regulations  and  also \nincorporates several climate change adaptation and road safety aspects. The project team \nconducted an independent review of the engineering design, and all recommended improvements \nhave subsequently been addressed in the design. \n \nB.  Economic Viability \n \n23.  The project is economically viable. Economic evaluation of the project was undertaken in \naccordance with ADB guidelines by comparing life cycle economic costs and benefits in with-\nproject and without-project scenarios, against an assumed hurdle rate of 9% as decision criteria.17 \nThe Highway Development Model 4 (HDM-4) was used to estimate road agency and road user \ncosts based on input data on traffic, road geometry, pavement condition, and improvement and \nmaintenance costs. Project benefits include savings associated with vehicle operating costs and \ntravel times. Additional benefits derived from better safety and quality of maintenance works have \nnot been included in the quantitative analysis and would improve the economic viability of the \nproject. The EIRR of the project is estimated at 16.5%, not including the benefits of reduced road \naccidents. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the economic viability of the project \nunder adverse changes in costs and benefits, with an EIRR of 11.3% under the most sensitive \nscenario involving (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a delay of 1 year in opening the project \nroads, (iii) a 15% decrease in traffic demand, and (iv) a decrease of 10% in time values of \npassengers.18 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n24.  The project will not generate revenue. Once the 5-year performance-based maintenance \nperiod is over, the MPWD will assume responsibility for maintenance through regular budget \nallocations in each financial year. Financial sustainability analysis demonstrated that the MPWD\u2019s \nannual budget allocation for maintenance increased from \u20b917.46 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2015 \nto about \u20b918.00 billion in FY2020, although portions of the road network still require maintenance \nand rehabilitation. The project\u2019s recurrent costs will not place an excessive burden on the MPWD \nto maintain the project roads in the future. The total estimated cost of maintaining the project \nroads is \u20b91.09 billion in constant prices over the 20-year asset life. The annual recurrent cost for \nroutine maintenance is estimated at \u20b954.17 million in constant prices, while periodic maintenance \nwill only be required in 2034 at an estimated cost of \u20b97.41 million in constant prices. The project\u2019s \nestimated  annual  recurrent  costs  are  estimated  at  about  0.3%  of  the  MPWD\u2019s  overall \nmaintenance budget allocation for FY2020. \n \n25.  The MPWD has committed to prioritizing the allocation of maintenance funding for the \nproject roads. However, road maintenance funding must be sustainable, and therefore the project \nsustainability risk is high. Capacity development under output 2 of this project (para. 12) will assist \nthe MPWD in developing a methodology to help sustain road assets at desirable levels; improve \npolicies and procedures; and increase project sustainability. \n \n17 Asian Development Bank. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n18 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  Institutional. The MPWD will implement the project through a PMU dedicated to ADB \nprojects, situated in the state capital Mumbai. Because the project covers a large geographic \narea, four field offices have been established under a PIU to support the PMU operation. The \nPMU and the field offices have sufficient staff capacity to prepare and implement the project. The \nPMS consultant will support the PMU in the areas of asset management, road safety, reporting, \nfinancial management, and safeguard monitoring. \n \n27.  Financial  management.  The  assessed  premitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate, mainly because the MPWD and the PMU have not previously implemented ADB-\nsupported projects and the PMU lacks an internal audit function. The risk will be mitigated through \nappropriate measures, such as engagement of a chartered accounting firm to perform internal \naudit of the project on a semiannual basis, and recruitment of specialist staff to prepare a financial \nmanagement manual and to provide training. \n \n28.  Procurement of civil works. The procurement risk level is medium. The assessment \nconcluded that the executing agency has significant experience in contract management and the \nprocurement  of  civil  works  and  consultant  recruitment  under  national  and  Government  of \nMaharashtra  procurement  regulations.  However,  the  executing  agency  is  new  to  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policies and regulations. Capacity-building sessions for procurement have already \nbeen provided. Under advance contracting, the procurement of nine civil works packages and \nrecruitment of consulting services are at advanced stages. The procurement of civil works and \nconsulting services financed by the ADB loan is in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time), and all procurement has been conducted under prior review. The \ne-procurement  system  was  assessed  by  ADB  as  part  of  due  diligence  and  found  to  be \nsatisfactory. Value for money has been optimized using multiple contract bidding to ensure least-\ncost combinations for civil works packages and 5-year performance-based maintenance contracts \nto ensure quality of work. The procurement strategy considered location in packaging both civil \nworks and consulting services packages. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MPWD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  Poverty. The average poverty level in Maharashtra is lower than the national rate as a \nresult of relatively higher average income levels in the four main urban centers: Mumbai, Nagpur, \nPune, and Thane. However, there is wide income disparity within Maharashtra, which the project \nwill help address by improving connectivity, facilitating access to services, and accelerating \neconomic growth. The project will improve state highways and major district roads in rural areas; \nbeneficiaries, including the poor, will benefit from improved access to basic services and living \nenvironments. The project will also improve livelihoods and trade opportunities for the nonurban \npopulation. The project preparatory phase involved consultations with local communities\u2014both \nwomen and men\u2014living along the proposed project roads. Community members were supportive \nof the project and expressed that the improved roads will enhance mobility between commercial \ncenters, which would increase economic and employment opportunities. Local communities also \nexpressed their belief that improved connectivity would contribute to reducing poverty. \n ", "9 \n \n31.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. There are several \ngender-related advantages to improved road infrastructure, including improved access to health \nand education services, increased income opportunities, affordable and reliable transportation \nfacilities promoting safe mobility, better implementation of government outreach programs, and \nreduced time poverty. A gender action plan has been prepared detailing activities with indicators \nand  targets,  responsible  agencies,  and  timeframes  to  ensure  effective  implementation, \nmonitoring, and reporting of gender action plan activities. The gender action plan outlines \nactivities to (i) enhance women\u2019s economic and human development opportunities; (ii) build \ninstitutional gender capacities through gender training for staff, consultants, and contractors; (iii) \nstrengthen the technical and management capacities of women staff in climate adaptation and \nresilience features applicable to road design and road safety auditing; (iv) create space for \nwomen\u2019s participation in decision-making and leadership; (v) reduce time poverty; and (vi) \npromote gender-responsive infrastructure by ensuring that road and bus shelter design includes \nfeatures responsive to the needs of the elderly, women, children, and the differently abled. This \ncomponent will include a pilot initiative of additional design features, such as solar lights and \ninformation on women-specific schemes, empowerment messages for women, and helpline \nnumbers in select bus shelters. \n \n32.  Labor. The bidding documents for the civil works contractors include provisions to (i) \nensure that all applicable labor laws are complied with, including the prohibition against employing \nchildren in construction; (ii) encourage employment of the poor and inhabitants of affected \ncommunities; and (iii) ensure that wages for men and women are equal for work of equal value. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). All road works will follow existing alignments, except for a \nfew improvements in road geometry in some portions. No significant, irreversible environmental \nimpacts are anticipated. Two roads\u2014State Highway 204 (Barshi\u2013Solapur) and State Highway \n68A (Korti\u2013Awati portion)\u2014pass through portions of the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary.20 The \nbiodiversity assessment established that the sanctuary is not a critical habitat for, nor will the road \nimprovement impact, the endangered birds.21 Mitigation measures were proposed in the initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) for the observed movement of wildlife, such as black bucks and \nother small mammals along these roads. No other roads pass through or are near any protected \nor environmentally sensitive areas. The MPWD prepared an IEE in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), which is on the ADB website. The MPWD will not allow road \nconstruction to commence without obtaining the necessary permits and clearances. Anticipated \nenvironmental impacts from the project entail typical road construction-related issues, such as \nacquisition of forest land; removal of trees; generation of dust, noise, exhaust, and waste from \nconstruction and worker camps; water contamination; occupational health and safety issues; \nslope failures; erosion; and siltation. There will be minimal noise and air pollution as a result of \nincreased traffic volumes, and levels will not exceed the National Ambient Air Quality and \nInternational Finance Corporation standards, except in some built-up locations where the baseline \n \n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n20 The Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary (formerly Jawaharlal Nehru Bustard Sanctuary) is identified as an Important \nBird and Biodiversity Area by BirdLife International, although noted as unsuitable habitat for the Great Indian Bustard. \n21 As assessed based on the International Finance Corporation\u2019s Guidance Note 6 on Biodiversity Conservation and \nSustainable Management of Living Natural Resources updated in 2019, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n ", "10 \nalready exceeds the Indian noise standard. The improvement works in these locations are \nanticipated to reduce noise by improving road surface conditions and reducing traffic congestion. \nVibration during construction and implementation is also unlikely to negatively affect sensitive \nreceptors along the road. Mitigation measures to address environmental impacts have been \nincluded  in  the  road-specific  environmental  management  plans,  which  are  part  of  the  bid \ndocuments. The MPWD conducted meaningful consultations with the affected persons and other \nkey stakeholders (e.g., forestry officials) while preparing the IEE. Concerns of affected persons \nand  stakeholders  have  been  considered  and  will  continue  to  be  addressed  during  project \nimplementation through the grievance redress mechanism. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will entail only limited involuntary \nresettlement because of minor land acquisition and some encroachment in built-up areas. Works \nwill be restricted to rights-of-way already owned by the executing agency, except in Pusad, \nYavatmal  district,  where  216  square  meters  of  barren  land  will  be  required  for  geometric \nimprovements to the road design. The MPWD will acquire the land owned by one person by direct \npurchase based on the provisions of national law, state policy, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. Should negotiations fail, land and assets will be acquired using eminent domain in \naccordance with the same law and policies. The MPWD has prepared a resettlement plan for \neach of the nine project roads based on full census surveys using detailed design specifications. \nThe  resettlement  plans  adequately  assess  the  scope  of  involuntary  resettlement,  and  the \nproposed mitigation measures are commensurate with the known risks and impacts. According \nto the surveys, 380 households (1,772 persons) will experience impacts on land, structures, \nand/or livelihoods. This includes one titled landowner and 379 nontitled households, which mostly \nown kiosks that will be shifted back, but remain in situ. The most sensitive subproject is in \nYavatmal District, where 40 nontitled households (190 persons) will experience loss of greater \nthan 10% of productive assets.22 Compensation rates at replacement cost, shifting assistance, \nincome-restoration assistance, and support for vulnerable groups are provided in the resettlement \nplans. The MPWD conducted meaningful consultations with displaced persons. The resettlement \nplans are disclosed in village council offices and the ADB website. Grievance redress committees \nat each field office will address affected persons\u2019 concerns. An implementation nongovernment \norganization will be engaged to support the MPWD. \n \n36.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  social  impact  assessments  undertaken  to \nprepare the project roads for rehabilitation suggest that no indigenous peoples\u2019 communities \nwithin the meaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement will be affected by the project. \n \n37.  Safeguards implementation. The PMU includes nodal officers for environmental and \nsocial safeguards. The PMU nodal officers will be responsible for the overall management of \nsafeguards under the project, supported by PIU officers, who will serve as the safeguards focal \npoints at the site level. The PMS consultant will provide project implementation support, including \nsafeguards implementation to the PMU. Two authority engineers will supervise and manage the \nconstruction works, including safeguards implementation. The civil works contractors will be \nresponsible for implementing the environmental management plan and will include environment, \nhealth, and safety officers in their team. The MPWD will organize an initial coordination or training \nworkshop to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party for complying with environmental \nand  social  safeguard  requirements.  Hands-on  training  will  be  conducted  by  the  authority \n \n22 The subproject will improve the Shrirampur\u2013Vaijapur\u2013Risod\u2013Washim\u2013Pusad\u2013Mahagaon\u2013Fulsawangi\u2013Mandvi Road \n(SH51) under Package EPC5. The census indicates that 19 kiosks and 11 residential structures owned by 33 \nhouseholds will be fully affected. The affected persons will not be required to relocate because all structures will be \nreconstructed in situ. \n ", "11 \nengineers or ADB as necessary during project implementation. \n \nG.
