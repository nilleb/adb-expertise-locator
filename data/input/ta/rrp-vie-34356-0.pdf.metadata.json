A  summary  initial \nAssessment  environmental examination was prepared and circulated to the ADB \nBoard of Directors on 1 June 2005. \n   \nProject Description  The  proposed  Central  Region  Transport  Networks  Improvement \nSector  Project  (the  Project)  will  address  the  removal  of  transport \nconstraints on economic and social development in rural areas of the \ncentral  region  of  Viet  Nam.  Outputs  from  the  Project  will  include \napproximately  1,200  km  of  sealed  all-weather  roads  connecting \nselected  rural  areas  and  district  and  provincial  centers  in  the  19 \nprovinces of the central region, road safety programs, and road and \nbridge  asset  management  systems  for  provincial  road  networks. \nUpgrading of project roads will be undertaken in three phases. A \ndesign and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1.  \n   \nRationale  The Project will address economic growth in the 19 provinces of the \ncentral region of Viet Nam by improving connections to rural areas \nwith poor, or seasonal, access and increasing the efficiency by which \npeople can move and goods can be traded. Nearly all of the central \nregion provinces have strikingly high rural poverty and two provinces \nare among the poorest in the country. Their remoteness and poor \nlinks  to  the  rest  of  the  economy,  including  lack  of  transport \nconnections through all-weather roads, are key factors in the region\u2019s \npoverty. Improvements to provincial and district roads will connect \nrural areas with provincial and national growth centers. \n \nIn Viet Nam\u2019s comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy \n(CPRGS), approved in May 2002, the development and rehabilitation \nof the transport system was a priority. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU),  approved  in \nAugust 2005, emphasizes (i) generating economic growth and (ii) a \nfocus on the central region. The Project is consistent with the CPRGS \nand the CSP. \n   \nWhen access to communities in remote areas is improved, they may \nbecome  vulnerable  to  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and  other  infectious \ndiseases  and  to  exploitation  through  human  trafficking  unless \nadequate  measures  are  taken.  To  address  this  risk,  the  Project \nincludes a component for a gender, HIV and anti-trafficking prevention \nprogram. ", "ii   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be felt in improved access to markets, \nemployment  opportunities,  and  social  services  by  removing \nconstraints on economic and social development in rural areas of the \ncentral region of Viet Nam. The outcome of the Project will be more \nefficient and cost-effective movements of passengers and goods in \nthese rural areas. \n   \nCost Estimates  The cost of the Project is estimated at $138 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The ADB loan will finance about 89.8% of the foreign exchange costs, \nestimated at $76.3 million, and about 34.3% of the local currency \ncosts, estimated at $18.2 million. An ADB grant of $0.5 million will be \nprovided  to  finance  a  gender,  HIV  and  anti-trafficking  prevention \nprogram.  The  Government  will  finance  $32.0  million  equivalent  of \nlocal currency costs and the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) will \nprovide $11 million equivalent to cofinance part of the cost of the \nconsulting services under the Project. NDF will finance 9.9% of the \nforeign exchange costs and 4.9% of the local currency costs. NDF \nfinancing will be made available as parallel financing. \n   \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $94.5 million equivalent, \nTerms  denominated in Special Drawing Rights from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources. The loan will have a term of 32 years with a grace period \nof 8 years. There will be an interest charge of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  4.5 years \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nresponsibility  for  planning  and  coordination  will  be  delegated  to \nProject Management Unit No. 1 (PMU-1).  \n   \nImplementation  PMU-1 will be responsible for recruiting consultants and awarding civil \nArrangements  works contracts. The provincial departments of transport (PDOTs) will \nbe  the  implementing  agencies  in  their  respective  provinces.  The \nPDOTs  have  established  provincial  project  management  units \n(PPMUs) that will be responsible for day-to-day administration of civil \nworks  contacts.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to \ndecentralize project responsibilities to the provinces. \n   \nProcurement  Civil works will be implemented through a number of contracts valued \nat between $0.5 million and $2 million. Each province will have up to \nfour contracts, for a total of about 68 contracts. Contracts will be \nprocured using local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable \nto ADB and will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n   ", "  iii\nConsulting Services  About  275  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  about \n2,965 person-months of domestic consultants will be required to work \nwith the Government to implement the Project. There will be four \nconsulting  services  packages  responsible  for  assistance  in  the \nselection  and  evaluation  of  subprojects,  preparation  of  civil  works \nimplementation  documents,  supervision  of  civil  works,  design  and \nimplementation of a program of capacity building and road safety \nprograms  in  selected  central  region  provinces,  and  design  and \nimplementation  of  a  gender,  HIV  and  anti-trafficking  prevention \nprogram. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will relieve the isolation of poor rural areas by reducing \nBeneficiaries  travel cost and time, and eliminating traffic disruptions during the wet \nseason. The direct benefits of the Project include (i) savings in vehicle \noperating costs and (ii) savings in passenger time costs. The indirect \nbenefits will stem from (i) induced lower input and consumer prices \nand (ii) generated economic activity in the project area.  \n   \nRisks and  One of the main risks associated with the Project is its sustainability. \nAssumptions  This risk has been mitigated by providing assistance to provincial \nauthorities to develop road maintenance management systems and \nan assurance that the project provinces will increase maintenance \nfunding by 100%.  \n \nWith regard to risks that may arise during implementation, the Project \nincludes  measures  to  mitigate  risks  arising  from  (i)  delays  (by \nretroactively  financing  consulting  services  and  taking  advanced \nactions for recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil works); \n(ii) poor contractor performance (by adopting procedures developed \nduring ongoing projects to ensure that contractors have the capacity \nto  implement  contracts  awarded);  (iii)  failure  to  implement  project \nsafeguards  (through  training  courses  and  provision  of  assistance \nunder  consulting  services);  and  (iv)  an  increase  in  road  traffic \naccidents  (by  incorporating  pilot  road  safety  programs  in  three \nprovinces,  developed  from  the  Government\u2019s  national  road  safety \nprogram).  \n \nThere is also a concern that the Project may increase the potential for \nthe  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted  infections \nbecause  of  the  influx  of  construction  workers  and  the  increased \ncontact  that  formerly  remote  areas  will  have  with  the  rest  of  the \ncountry.  Road  connections  may  also  lead  to  human  trafficking  of \nteenage  children  and  women.  These  risks  will  be  minimized  and \nmitigated  through  a  gender,  HIV  and  anti-trafficking  prevention \nprogram,  designed  to  raise  awareness  and  provide  preventive \nmeasures  for  local  communities  (with  a  special  focus  on  ethnic \nwomen), construction workers, and the mobile populations. \n   \n ", "103o  00\u2019E 108o  00\u2019E\nHa Giang\nCao Bang PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\nLao Cai\nBac Kan\nLai Chau Tuyen Quang Lang Son\nThai Nguyen\nYen Bai\nSon La Vinh Yen\nViet Tri\nDien Bien Bac Giang\nHANOI\nHa Long\nHai\nHoa Binh Duong Hai Phong\nThai Binh\nNinh Binh Gulf   of   Tonkin\n20o  00\u2019N LAO  PEOPLE'S 20 o 00\u2019N\nDEMOCRATIC  REPUBLIC 1 Thanh Hoa\nCENTRAL REGION PROVINCES\n1.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region \nTransport Networks Improvement Sector Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The Project1 will address economic growth in the 19 provinces of the central region of \nViet Nam by improving connections to rural areas with poor, or seasonal, access and thereby \nincreasing the efficiency with which people can move and goods can be traded. The central \nregion of Viet Nam has strikingly high rural poverty, which is sustained by the remoteness of \nmany communities and their poor links to the rest of the economy. In the central region, the lack \nof all-weather provincial and district roads has isolated poor rural communities from provincial \nand national markets and, ultimately, the benefits of economic growth. A design and monitoring \nframework for the Project is in Appendix 1.  \n \n3.  The  central  region  of  Viet  Nam  consists  of  19  provinces  distributed  among  three \nsubregions: north central coast, south central coast, and central highlands. The population of \nthe central region is approximately 23.1 million people consisting of 11 indigenous groups \nbelonging  to  three  linguistic  families,  the  Kinh,  Malayo-Polynesian,  and  Mon-Khmer.  The \ntopography in the project area includes a flat, flood-prone coastal plain along the eastern side, \ngently rolling hills near the border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic in the north, and \nlow mountains in the southern provinces. The predominant economic activity in rural areas is \nagriculture; rice  predominates  on  the  coastal plain,  while  coffee, tea,  and  sugar  cane  are \nabundant in hilly and low mountain areas. About 78% of the population of this region lives in \nrural areas. The overall poverty incidence is 29%, but in rural areas it is 46% compared with \n14% in urban areas.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  The principal mode for the movement of goods and people in the central region is by \nroad. The network of national roads enabling movement between regions and provinces is well \ndeveloped. However, the networks of provincial and district roads within each province are \nsparse and the quality is poor. Rural areas need better connections to the provincial and \nnational road networks.2 Provincial and district roads are important because they link commune \nand district roads with district and provincial centers and with the national highway network. The \nprovincial road networks in the central region have significant needs and will require a series of \ninvestments over a period of time.  \n \n5.  The poor condition of provincial and district roads has a major impact on the livelihoods \nof people living in rural areas. Bus and truck operators are reluctant to provide services on poor \nroads and even when they do these services stop when roads are closed because of flooding.  \nAccess  to  job  opportunities,  markets,  schools,  and  health  facilities  is  restricted.    As  a \nconsequence, the provision of sealed all-weather roads will have a major impact on the quality \nof life of people in rural areas. \n                                                 \n1  Project preparatory TA was financed from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan (ADB. \n2002. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Preparation of the Central Region Network \nProject. Manila [TA4034-VIE]). \n2  ADB. 2000. TA 2959-VIE: Preparation of Action and Investment Plans for the Central Region Development \nStrategy. Final Report. Manila. ", "2 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  responsible  for  the  overall  management  and \ndevelopment  of  the  transport  sector.  At  the  provincial  and  district  levels,  responsibility  for \nplanning and programming for transport sector investments and operations is vested in the \nprovincial departments of transport (PDOTs), which are responsible to their respective provincial \npeople\u2019s committees (PPCs). The PDOTs are not directly responsible to MOT, but they have \nlinks to MOT to carry out certain works. An analysis of the provincial road subsector is given in \nAppendix 2. \n \n7.  Information from the central region PDOTs reveals that 61% of provincial and district \nroads under the PDOTs are sealed and 39% are gravel or earth.  About half of the total road \nlength is in bad or poor condition.  Detailed field surveys that were carried out on 28 provincial \nand district roads (544 km) in nine representative provinces as part of project preparation \nrevealed many deficiencies: road foundations and pavement cross-sections did not meet basic \nstandards,  poor  alignments  and  narrow  bridges  or  culverts  created  numerous  road  safety \nhazards, cross-drainage was inadequate, many bridges needed to be repaired or replaced, \nmany sections of road were passable only by motorcycle or four-wheel-drive vehicle, many \nroads were closed for long periods during the wet season, and the surface condition of most \nroads was very rough. The net result of these deficiencies is that travel speeds are very low. \n \n8.  The  central  region  PDOTs  have  produced  road  master  plans  and  identified project \nrequirements but, in many instances, accepted transport planning procedures have not been \nused to prepare the proposed projects or to establish priorities. This has led to a misallocation of \nresources.  Most  PDOTs  lack  the  systems,  technical  equipment,  and  training  needed  for \neffective road asset planning and training. The Government recognizes the problems faced by \nthe PDOTs and has begun various programs help them. The Viet Nam Road Administration \n(VRA) and several donor-funded projects are trying to introduce road maintenance management \nprocesses  into  the  PDOTs  and  road  maintenance  companies.  However,  so  far  the  main \nemphasis  has  been  on  national  highways  and  little  work  has  been  done  to  apply  these \nprocesses to provincial roads.  \n \n9.  Additional budget allocations are urgently needed for provincial road maintenance. The \nPDOTs do not receive sufficient budget allocations from the PPCs to enable them to carry out \nenough routine and periodic maintenance to keep the provincial road network in an acceptable \ncondition. The result is neglect and the deterioration of many roads (which then require costly \nrehabilitation works). The problem is compounded by a lack of road maintenance management \nprocesses to enable the PDOT to monitor road conditions, quantify work requirements and \ncosts,  and  substantiate  requests  for  increased  maintenance  budgets.  Road  failures  are \ncommon, because of a combination of inadequate design standards for the traffic loads, weak \nquality  management  during  construction,  inadequate  routine  maintenance,  and  failure  to \nregulate truck axle loads. A study under the World-Bank-funded Road Network Improvement \nProject will help MOT to develop a heavy traffic management strategy. \n \n10.  Poor road safety is a serious and growing problem throughout Viet Nam: 16 provinces in \nthe central region reported a total of 3,065 road deaths in 2003, equivalent to 17 deaths per \nannum per 100,000 population, or 24 deaths per annum per 10,000 vehicles. The comparable \nfigure in the United Kingdom is 1.5 deaths per annum per 10,000 vehicles and in Thailand 5.5. \nThe road safety problem is most serious on the national highway network, but road deaths and \ninjuries will rise on provincial roads as they are improved, and as operating speeds and traffic ", "3 \nincrease. There is a need to increase awareness of road safety on provincial roads, in the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s national road safety program, with the PDOTs, road users and the \npublic all having a role to play.  Programs need to be introduced that are directed specifically at \nprovincial roads. \n \n1.  Government\u2019s Strategy \n11.  Viet Nam\u2019s comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy (CPRGS), approved in \nMay  2002,  included  the  development  and  rehabilitation  of  the  transport  system  as  a  key \nelement. The CPRGS noted that improvements are needed at all levels of the transport network \nbut specifically identified the need to connect to poor rural areas with all-weather roads. The \nmain issues in the road subsector and the government\u2019s strategy to address them are as \nfollows. First, further strategic road sector investments are needed. The Government has a \nprogram of high-priority investments valued at approximately $12 billion to be implemented \nbetween 2001 and 2010. Second, maintenance needs to be improved and there needs to be a \nstable source of maintenance funding. The Government is working to improve maintenance \nplanning systems and identify mechanisms to ensure secure funding. Third, road accidents and \nfatalities need to be reduced. The Government has developed a national road safety strategy \nwhich will be implemented soon. Fourth, fragmentation needs to be reduced and public sector \ncapacity increased. The Government is addressing the lack of coordination, particularly at the \nVRA, the agency with maintenance and asset use responsibilities, but further work is required to \nestablish a systematic and modern approach to road asset management and maintenance. \nFifth, the role of the private sector needs to be increased. Current government efforts have \nlargely focused on overcoming constraints on smaller private firms entering the market for road \nconstruction and smaller civil works. The entry of larger companies and private participation in \nlarger public\u2013private partnership schemes, such a build-operate-transfer toll roads, has been \nvery limited. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n12.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country strategy and program update (CSPU), \napproved in August 2005, emphasizes (i) generating economic growth and (ii) a focus on the \ncentral region. The long-term objective of ADB\u2019s strategy for the road subsector in Viet Nam is \nan  economically  viable  road  network  that  meets  demands  for  access  and  efficiency.  The \nstrategy  requires  a  mix  of  investment  and  policy  interventions  to  build  both  the  physical \ninfrastructure of the road network and the legal and regulatory framework within which the road \nnetwork will be administered. The investment objective of the strategy is to help the Government \nto improve and extend the road network to meet the demands created by rapid economic \ngrowth and to extend the benefits of this growth to remote rural communities. The policy \nobjective  of  the  strategy  is  to  develop  the  capacity  of  road  administration  authorities  to \nadminister the road sector through a comprehensive set of systems that address planning, \nfunding, implementation, and management of the construction, operation, and maintenance of \nthe road network. \n \n13.  The initial focus of ADB investments was the rehabilitation of Route 1, the main road \nconnecting  major  urban  and  economic  centers  along  Viet  Nam\u2019s  north\u2013south  axis.  Initial \nimprovement works on Route 1 have been completed, so ADB is now funding improvements to \nthe provincial road networks. These networks can help to stimulate economic growth and the \nprovision  of  social  services  by  connecting  rural  areas  to  district,  provincial,  regional,  and \nnational centers. Initial policy work with the national administration now needs to be extended to \nprovincial road authorities.  ", "4 \n \n14.  Separate action plans have been prepared to reflect the VRA\u2019s responsibility for national \nroad  networks  and  provincial  governments\u2019  responsibility  for  the  provincial  road  networks. \nThese action plans address (i) the legal framework for administration and responsibilities under \nthat framework, (ii) the development of the road network to promote economic growth and \nimprove access to rural communities, (iii) the allocation of funds to maintain the road network, \n(iv) the allocation of funds for long-term routine and periodic maintenance, (v) institutional \ncapacity for road maintenance management, (vi) the efficiency of road maintenance delivery, \nand  (vii)  road  safety  issues.  Policy  interventions  are  being  coordinated  with  other  donors, \nprincipally the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID), Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank. The status of actions taken and \nfuture actions proposed under both national and provincial road subsector action plans are \nsummarized in Appendix 3. Actions required under the national road subsector action plan are \nbeing addressed under ongoing projects, including ADB\u2019s Third Road Improvement Project3 and \nProvincial Roads Improvement Project,4  and the World Bank\u2019s Road Network Improvement \nProject. The provincial road subsector action plan was developed under the PPTA (footnote 1) \nand will be implemented under this Project. \n \n3.  External Assistance \n15.  Since the lifting of the embargo on external financing in 1993, there have been several  \nprojects  aimed  at  the  road  subsector  in  Viet  Nam.  Initially,  these  projects  focused  on \nrehabilitating National Highway 1, which runs along the eastern coast of Viet Nam and acts as \nthe central spine for the road network. With the work on National Highway 1 drawing to a close, \nprojects are increasingly focusing on other parts of the road network. ADB\u2019s Provincial Roads \nImprovement Project (PRIP) (footnote 4) is upgrading provincial roads in 17 provinces in the \nnorthern uplands and Red River Delta regions. The upgrading of rural roads in 18 provinces \nwas addressed under ADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Sector Project5 and rural roads are being \nimproved in 40 provinces across the country with funding from the World Bank and DFID under \nthe Rural Transport 1 (RT1) and Rural Transport 2 (RT2) projects. External assistance to the \nroad subsector is summarized in Appendix 4. Interventions supported by international donors \nhave  provided  (i)  funding  to  supplement  domestic  sources  for  priority  projects  with  high \neconomic returns, (ii) assistance in preparing and using contract documentation to international \nstandards, (iii) assistance in carrying out project planning and implementation to international \nstandards,  and  (iv)  assistance  in  identifying  and  addressing  capacity  constraints  in  the \nadministration and management of the road subsector.  \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n16.  Viet  Nam  country  portfolio  review  missions  have  noted  that  there  have  been \nimplementation delays in previous road projects, in particular during the project start-up phase. \nProject designs have required that project supervision consultants prepare detailed designs and \nbidding documents for civil works. Delays in recruiting such consultants, or in preparing detailed \ndesigns, have led directly to delays in award of civil works. To expedite the awarding of civil \nworks contacts for this Project, the preparation of detailed designs and bidding documents, and \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1998.

", "5 \nprocurement of civil works for the roads in the first phase will be undertaken during loan \nprocessing. By loan effectiveness, the civil works contracts for the roads in the first phase \nshould be ready to be awarded, allowing funds for civil works to be disbursed up to 2 years \nearlier than for previous projects.  \n \n17.  Recent reviews of ADB\u2019s portfolio in Viet Nam have identified difficulties with contracts \nprocured by provincial authorities. However, reviews of procurement under the ongoing PRIP \n(footnote 4) have concluded that the procurement arrangements and procedures adopted have \ngenerally been effective. This appears to be because provincial road sector agencies have had \ngreater  exposure  to  international  agencies  and  now  have  a  better  understanding  of  their \nprocurement procedures and requirements. Therefore, the procurement arrangements under \nthe PRIP have been adopted for this Project with minor adjustments to reflect lessons learned. \nThese  adjustments  principally  concern  ensuring  that  during  prequalification  the  previous \nexperience, bid capacity, and quality of work under previous contracts are correctly reflected in \nevaluations. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  felt  in  improved  access  to  markets,  employment \nopportunities, and social services by removing constraints on economic and social development \nin rural areas of the central region of Viet Nam. The outcome of the Project will be to induce \nmore efficient and cost-effective movement of passengers and goods in these rural areas.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n19.  Outputs  from  the  Project  will  include  rehabilitation  of  and  improvements  to  about \n1,200 km of roads connecting selected rural areas and district and provincial centers. Road \nsafety programs will be implemented, and sustainable road and bridge asset management \nsystems established. \n \n1.  Network Improvements \n20.  Under this component about 1,200 km of roads will be improved to Viet Nam single-lane \n(Class V) or two-lane (Class IV) standard in 19 provinces in the central region. All roads will be \nrehabilitated with a sealed surface. The civil works will include repair or replacement of bridges \nand culverts either as part of improvements or as separate subprojects. A description of the \nproposed road improvements is given in Appendix 5. Under the PPTA (footnote 1) 4,200 km of \nroads were screened to create a long list covering 2,360 km of provincial and district roads. \nFrom this list subprojects were chosen for the Project. The roads in this subproject list were \nranked and for each province priority roads were identified in terms of their importance to \nprovincial and district road networks. Selection of subprojects took account of the need for each \nlink within the network as a whole. The civil works will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1 \nwill  cover  networks  in  four  provinces6  for  which  resettlement  plans  have  been  appraised. \nPreparation work has been completed to a point where detailed design work can begin. Phase 2 \nwill cover five provinces7 for which subprojects have been identified but implementation has not \n                                                 \n6  Binh Thuan, Lam Dong, Nghe An, and Thuan Thie Hue provinces. \n7  Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Ha Tinh, Ninh Thuan, and Quang Tri provinces. \n ", "6 \nbeen fully prepared. Road links within each network have been selected and technical and \neconomic viability confirmed. Phase 3 will cover 10 provinces for which subprojects will be \nselected during project implementation on the basis of prioritized long lists.  \n \n21.  Subproject Selection. Under the PPTA (footnote 1) each province in the central region \nwas  asked  to  provide  a  long  list  of  provincial  and  district  roads  requiring  upgrading  or \nrehabilitation.  These  lists  were  screened  and  ranked  using  simple  social  and  economic \nindicators. The resulting prioritized list of roads was compiled into a provincial road sector \ndevelopment plan (PRSDP) for each of the 19 provinces in the central region (Supplementary \nAppendix A). For nine provinces, subproject networks were identified, containing priority roads \nfrom  the  PRSDP.  The  principles  used  in  drawing  up  these  subproject  networks  included \n(i) extending  networks  to  connect  rural  areas,  and  (ii)  maintaining  links  across  networks. \nEvaluations of these nine networks showed them to be technically feasible and economically \njustified. From these nine provincial subproject networks, four were selected and resettlement \nplans prepared. These four resettlement plans were regarded as representative of the range of \nresettlement impacts that could be expected under the Project. Sample initial environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) were prepared for road networks in three provinces, selected as being \nrepresentative of the range of environmental impacts that could be expected under the Project. \nThe results of these sample IEEs were used to prepare the project IEE; a summary of the \nproject IEE is in Supplementary Appendix B. A survey of the nine selected provinces indicated \nthat, although ethnic minorities lived within the zones of influence of some road links, they were \ngenerally well assimilated and the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples was not triggered. \nHowever, where appropriate, special actions for ethnic minorities were included in resettlement \nplans.  \n \n22.  To be eligible for financing under the Project, subprojects have to be (i) technically \njustified8 and economically viable,9 (ii) environmentally and socially responsible, (iii) part of the \nprovincial road sector development plan (PRSDP), and (iv) in compliance with all applicable \nADB policies. Roads that provide a connection to an international border, or where rehabilitation \nwork will cause significant adverse environmental impacts, cannot be included in the Project. \nThe process by which subprojects will be selected, evaluated, and prepared is set out in \nAppendix 6. For each subproject, the Ministry of Transport\u2019s PMU-1 submits a request for \napproval to ADB that includes (i) a technical design and economic evaluation report, (iii) an IEE \nor environmental impact assessment, (iv) the Government\u2019s environment approval, and (v) a \nresettlement plan. If surveys show that ethnic minorities lie within the zone of influence of any \nsubproject, and that ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is triggered, then an ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan (EMDP) must also be submitted in a format acceptable to ADB.  \n \n23.  Resettlement. A resettlement policy framework (RPF) and four resettlement plans for \nBinh Thuan, Lam Dong, Nghe An, and Thuan Thie Hue Phase 1 road networks have been \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Consultations with and \nparticipation of affected communities and local government agencies were carried out during the \npreparation of the RPF and resettlement plans.  The RPF and resettlement plans require that \neveryone affected by land acquisition and resettlement is adequately compensated for lost \nassets and that sufficient measures are taken to ensure that they are able to restore pre-project \nliving standards. Special assistance will be provided to the poorest and vulnerable people.   \n \n                                                 \n8  The technical justification must include connections to the provincial road network. \n9  The economic internal rate of return will exceed 12% for eligible subprojects. ", "7 \n24.  Based on the preliminary results of the census and inventory of losses for four provinces \ncarried out during the PPTA (footnote 1), about 400 affected households (about 2,073 people) \nhave been identified. The road improvement will entail the acquisition of 6 hectares (ha) of \nagricultural land, 5 ha of residential land, 990 square meters (m2) of salt making land, and 630 \nm2  of  fishpond.    It  will  also  partially  affect  three  house/shops  and  permanently  affect  27 \nstructures (fences and toilets) and 67 graves.  An estimated 5,300 trees, 1,800 m of plant \nfences, and 53 ha of crops will also be affected by the Project in these four provinces.    \n \n25.  During loan implementation, the four resettlement plans will be updated for Phase 1 and \nresettlement plans for Phases 2 and 3 will be prepared following detailed designs.  Updating \nand preparation of resettlement plans will involve consultations and community participation, \ndetailed  measurement  surveys  (DMSs),  establishment  of  compensation  unit  rates  for  all \ncategories of losses and allowances, and formulation of rehabilitation measures for severely \naffected, very poor, and other vulnerable groups.  Disclosure of resettlement plans will be \nthrough  the  distribution  of  project  information  brochures  (in  Vietnamese  and,  as  required, \nminority languages) to the affected communities. Copies of resettlement plans will be placed in \nprovincial, district, and commune offices.  All resettlement plans submitted to ADB for review will \nbe posted on the ADB website immediately upon ADB approval. A summary of the resettlement \npolicy framework is in Appendix 7 and a summary of the resettlement plans for the Phase 1 \nroads is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n26.  Ethnic Minorities.  An initial social assessment was carried out during the PPTA for \nPhases 1 and 2.  About 55,000 people from ethnic minorities live along roads on five of the nine \nnetworks, representing about 6.2% of the total population living along the roads in Phases 1 and \n2. Although the roads where these ethnic minorities live are in a poor condition, and often allow \nonly seasonal access, these communities have access to some degree, are living among the \nmajority Kinh people, and are assimilated to varying degrees. Therefore, the impacts on ethnic \nminorities are expected to be limited.   \n \n27.  An ethnic minority development framework (EMDF) has been prepared in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1999), and policies and programs of the Government \nof Viet Nam.  The EMDF will serve as guide in the preparation of ethnic minority specific actions \n(EMSA) if the impacts are found to be limited and ethnic minority development plans (EMDPs) if \nthe impacts are significant. The EMDF includes other measures to address ethnic minorities, \nsuch as incorporation of road safety measures in road designs, an HIV/AIDS10 and sexually \ntransmitted infections (STI) awareness and prevention program, and sustainable agricultural \nproduction.  A summary ethnic minority development framework is presented in Appendix 8. \n \n2.  Institutional Development Component \n28.  This  component  will  address  the  need  to  improve  management  of  provincial  road \nnetworks as set out in the provincial roads policy action plan in Appendix 3. Activities will \ncomprise technical assistance (TA) to help the PDOTs to carry out core road management \nactivities. Consultants will work with the PDOTs to (i) prepare provincial road network plans; \n(ii) implement provincial road maintenance management processes; (iii) increase efficiency of \nimplementation of periodic maintenance plans by introducing competitive bidding; (iv) establish \na resettlement, social, and environmental capacity; and (v) establish a pilot provincial road \nsafety program in three provinces. This technical assistance has been designed to be consistent \nwith the proposed DFID-funded assistance to 32 PDOTs under the Rural Transport 3 Project \n                                                 \n10 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ", "8 \n(RT3).  Under  this  component,  assistance  will  be  given  to  10  central  region  provinces; \nassistance to the remainder will be given under the DFID-funded program. Training of PDOT \nstaff and basic equipment will be provided to support the technical assistance. \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant Component \n29.  When access to communities in remote areas is improved, they may become vulnerable \nto HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases and to exploitation through human trafficking unless \nmeasures are taken. The Project will therefore design, implement, and monitor a gender, HIV \nand  anti-trafficking  prevention  program  that  will  target  project  communities,  construction \nworkers, civil servants, and the mobile population.  This will include: (i) a baseline survey on \nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and village populations, which will include \ncollecting epidemiological information and a knowledge, attitude, behavior, and practice survey; \n(ii) formation of village monitoring groups; (iii) preventive education and awareness through peer \neducation and training of trainers; (iv) behavior, communication, and change (BCC) awareness, \nincluding preparation of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials; and (v) STI \nservices  and  counseling  and  voluntary  testing,  condom  promotion,  and  distribution.  This \nprogram will be implemented through awareness programs under consulting services (i) in \nconstruction camps, and (ii) for the general population, including civil servants and mobile \npopulations. Because of women's greater exposure to the risks and impact of HIV/AIDS, the \nProject will ensure that women, and especially women from ethnic minorities, are involved in the \ndesign and implementation of HIV and human trafficking prevention, and that they participate in \nany community-based structures to be established under the Project to monitor HIV/AIDS and \nprevent human trafficking. \n \nD.  Special Features \n30.  The selection of subprojects was based on an assessment of gaps in the road networks \nin each of the provinces within the project area. A gap may be (i) a missing link; (ii) a link that \nrequires upgrading when capacity is insufficient to meet demand; or (iii) a link that requires \nrehabilitation when the existing road is in poor condition or allows only seasonal access. This \nnetwork  approach  means  that  each  road  link  selected  as  a  subproject  not  only  connects \ncommunities  along  each  link  but  also  connects  these  communities  to  the  wider  economy \nthrough the wider road network. \n \n31.  During project preparation, discussions were held with other development partners to \nmaximize the impact of the Project. Selection of roads for inclusion in the Project will take into \naccount the location of bridges to be improved, or replaced, under the JBIC-funded Weak \nBridge Replacement Project, which is part of the $90.4 million transport sector loan for national \nroad improvement. The institutional development component has been designed to link with a \nDFID-funded  $12  million  program,  so  that  the  combined  interventions  cover  all  provincial \ngovernments. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n32.  The cost of the Project is estimated at $138 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest charges during construction. The foreign \nexchange component is $84.99 million (61.6% of the total project cost) and the local currency \ncomponent is $53.02 million equivalent (38.4%). These costs are based on estimates for typical \nroads in the terrain encountered in the project provinces based on the feasibility study prepared ", "9 \nunder the PPTA (footnote 1). Table 1 shows a breakdown of costs. Detailed cost estimates and \na financing plan for the Project are given in Appendix 9.  \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n33.  The Project\u2019s financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are given in Appendix \n9. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $94.5 million equivalent, denominated in special \ndrawing rights from its Special Funds resources. The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years with \na grace period of 8 years. There will be an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and 1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The Borrower  for  the  Project  will  be  the  Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be responsible for repayment of the \nloan. The MOF will provide counterpart funds to the Ministry of Transport (MOT) through priority \nbudgetary allocations. ADB has provided $1 million for the PPTA, funded from the Japan \nSpecial Fund (footnote 1). \n \n34.  It is also proposed that ADB provide a grant of $0.5 million from its Special Funds \nresources. This grant will finance the gender, HIV and anti-trafficking prevention program and \nwill fund consulting services, training, and incremental expenditures required to implement the \nprogram.  \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n         Foreign  Local  Total \nItem \n         Exchange  Currency  Cost \n             \nA.

The Government will finance $32.0 million equivalent of local currency costs, which will \ncover land acquisition and resettlement, including the ethnic minority development component \nof  the  resettlement  plans;  unexploded  ordnance  clearance;  independent  monitoring  of  the \nresettlement  plan  provisions;  project  management  costs;  local  currency  contingencies;  the \nremaining portion of the civil works costs; and all taxes and duties.  \n ", "10 \n36.  The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) will provide a loan of \u20ac8.3 million ($11 million \nequivalent)11 to cofinance part of the cost of the consulting services for implementation and \ninstitutional  development.  NDF  financing  will  be  made  available  as  parallel  tied  financing. \nAlthough no commercial cofinancing is envisioned at this time, cofinancing from commercial \nsources  may  be  mobilized  in  future.  Such  cofinancing  would  benefit  from  ADB  credit \nenhancement, including ADB guarantee instruments, and would be presented separately for \nBoard consideration.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan12\n($ million) \n         \n      Foreign  Local  Total \nSource     Exchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nADB  ADF Loan  76.3 18.2  94.5\nADB  ADF Grant  0.3 0.2  0.5\nNDF  Concessional Loan  8.4 2.6  11.0\nGovernment  Counterpart Funds  0.0 32.0  32.0\nTotal     85.0 53.0  138.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, NDF = Nordic Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n37.  The amount of local currency funding reflects the fact that the Government has difficulty \nmobilizing  sufficient  funds  from  its  own  resources  to  meet  all  development  commitments, \nincluding rehabilitating and upgrading critical physical and social infrastructure. Although the \nneed to generate domestic resources to finance investments for sustaining economic growth is \nwell  recognized,  the  country\u2019s  resources  cannot  finance  the  investments  needed  without \nexternal  assistance.  Under  the  current  circumstances,  a  large  saving-investment  gap  will \ncontinue exerting pressure on development programs; thus external support is needed to meet \nsome of the local costs of the projects.  In line with ADB\u2019s policy to help provide local currency \ncost financing, particularly for projects that address poverty in economically less-developed \nregions, about 19% of the loan will be for that purpose.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n38.  The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Transport and responsibility for planning \nand coordination will be delegated to Project Management Unit No 1 (PMU-1), which has \nconsiderable experience of implementing ADB-financed projects.  PMU-1 will be responsible for \nprocurement  and  awarding  consultant  and  civil  works  contracts.  The  PDOTs  will  be  the \nImplementing Agencies in their respective provinces. They will require support and assistance \nfrom  PMU-1  and  the  project  consultants  to  manage  and  implement  the  civil  works  and \nresettlement plans effectively, as well as to prepare subprojects. Project coordination will be the \n                                                 \n11  At appraisal, March 2005. \n12  The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement is presented in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) \nequivalent of $94.5 million, with reference only to total expenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing \nand Eligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. Similarly, the allocation of \ngrant proceeds in the Grant Agreement is presented as US$0.5 million, with reference only to total expenditure. ", "11 \nresponsibility  of  the  MOT  vice-minister  assigned  to  the  Project.  A  preparation  and \nimplementation manual written during project preparation will be used by PMU-1 during project \nimplementation. The Project\u2019s organization and implementation arrangements are shown in \nAppendix 10. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n39.  The Project will be implemented in three phases over 4 years. Field investigations, \ndetailed design, cost estimates, resettlement and procurement for the Phase 1 contracts started \nin September 2005 and have proceeded in parallel with loan processing.  Construction of Phase \n1 civil works is planned to start in July 2006. Preparation of documentation and commencement \nof civil works for Phases 2 and 3 will follow sequentially as individual tasks are completed under \nPhase 1. Construction of Phase 2 civil works is planned to start in January 2007 and for Phase \n3 in July 2007. The Phase 3 construction is scheduled to be completed in June 2009. The \nProject will be complete when the contractors\u2019 liability for the repair of defects and maintenance \nends in June 2010. A summary implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n3.  Procurement \n40.  All procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil \nworks will be implemented through a number of contracts valued at between $500,000 and \n$2 million. Each province will have up to four contracts, for a total of about 68 contracts. \nContracts valued at up to $2 million will be procured using local competitive bidding (LCB) \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Details of proposed contracts for Phases 1 and 2 are given in \nAppendix 12. In essence, these procedures will generally follow those of the provincial road \ncomponents of the ongoing PRIP (footnote 4) and World Bank-financed rural transport projects.  \nHarmonized bidding documents for use on all donor-funded LCB contracts are being prepared. \nOnce they are approved for use on ADB projects, these documents will be adopted; pending \nthis, the documents used for earlier projects, which have been approved by ADB, will be used. \nA civil works contract for the construction of, and the provision of office equipment for, an \noperations office for PMU-1 in Da Nang will be procured using LCB procedures. Approval for \nadvance procurement action has been granted, and the Government has been advised that this \napproval does not commit ADB to finance the ensuing Project. \n \n41.  ADB and the World Bank have been engaged in the reform of state-owned enterprises \n(SOE) as part of an enterprise reform and corporate governance program. The purpose of the \nreforms is to promote competitive practices, maximize private sector involvement for ADB-\nfinanced projects, and support SOE corporatization or privatization. Under this program, it has \nbeen agreed that, to be eligible to bid on ADB funded projects from 1 January 2005, enterprises \npreviously owned by the state must be legally and financially independent from MOT and must \noperate under the Government\u2019s commercial laws.  \n \n42.  There  are  about  400  construction  companies  operating  in  the  19  central  region \nprovinces, of which about 130 have annual turnovers of greater than $1 million. However, most \nof the larger companies are SOEs that may be ineligible to bid under ADB\u2019s conflict-of-interest \nguidelines, or joint stock companies that may also be ineligible under the guidelines set out in \nparagraph 41. A further 160 construction companies are small private companies with an annual \nturnover of less than $500,000. These small private companies do not have the financial or \ntechnical  capacity  to  undertake  the  type  of  work  required  under  the  Project  as  individual \ncompanies. The remaining 110 construction companies are private contractors with an annual \nturnover greater than $500,000. To ensure that enough qualified private contractors, together ", "12 \nwith those larger contractors that are eligible, are available to bid for the Project\u2019s contracts, the \nnumber and size of contracts have been specified to be within the capacity of these contractors. \n \n43.  Detailed procurement procedures and sample procurement documentation have been \ndeveloped in consultation with PMU-1. They incorporate the experience of similar ADB and \nWorld  Bank-financed  projects,  particularly  the  PRIP  (footnote  4).  After  MOT  review  and \napproval, the procedures and documentation will be submitted to ADB for approval before the \nfirst bids are invited. Ideally, all the contracts for a particular province should be procured \nsimultaneously. A contractor\u2019s performance in an earlier  phase will determine  whether the \ncompany can participate in bidding for the subsequent phases. The number of contracts a \ncontractor can be awarded will be determined by the company\u2019s capacity to execute multiple \ncontracts. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  About 275 person-months of international consultants and about 2,965 person-months of \ndomestic consultants will be required to assist in (i) selection of subprojects, preparation of \nimplementation  documentation,  and  assistance  in  bidding;  (ii)  construction  supervision, \nincluding  preparation  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans,  EMDPs  (if  required), \nHIV/AIDS/STI awareness and prevention programs, and IEEs with environment management \nplans; (ii) project performance monitoring and evaluation; (iii) institutional strengthening and \ncapacity building for provincial agencies in the administration and management of the provincial \nroad networks; and (iv) preparing and implementing a provincial road safety program.  A list of \ncontract packages and modes of recruitment are given in Appendix 12. The consultants are \nexpected to be recruited as an association of international and domestic firms, as appropriate, \nengaged by the Government. The overall period of the services will be about 42 months. \nFurnished office facilities and utilities, vehicles, and equipment required by the consultants will \nbe provided under the Project. Field offices and material testing laboratories with utilities and \nmotorcycles required by construction inspectors will be supplied through civil works contracts. \nEquipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n45.  Consulting services to be funded from ADB and NDF loan funds have been divided into \nfour  packages  as  set  out  below.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  each  consulting  services \npackage are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n(i)  Civil works preparation consulting services.  To avoid the startup delays \nencountered in previous projects, consultants will assist in the preparation of \ndetailed designs and civil works bidding for Phase 1 and 2 roads. Recruitment \nwill be based on direct selection procedures under the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by ADB and Its Borrowers. Recruitment will be based on quality-\nbased selection documents with a full proposal. It is proposed that the PPTA \nconsultant be engaged for these services, as this consultant has successfully \ncompleted the services under the PPTA and has extensive knowledge of the \nproject. A request will not, therefore, be made to require the PPTA consultant to \nabstain from future work on the Project. The Government has requested that \nfunds from the loan be applied retroactively to these services up to a limit of \n$2.5 million equivalent (approximately 3.5% of the loan amount) and that the \nperiod of eligibility be from 21 March 2005.13 This date will be within a period of \n12 months prior to loan effectiveness. The amount requested and the period of \n                                                 \n13  The first day of the loan appraisal mission. ", "13 \neligibility are within the normal limits for sector loans. The use of direct selection \nand retroactive financing is justified as the proposed services are to complete \npreparatory  work  for  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts  and  are  targeted  at \nreducing delays in the physical commencement of civil works. \n(ii)  Project implementation services. These services will include the preparation of \nimplementation  documents  for  Phase  3  and  construction  supervision  for  all \nPhases. These services will be funded by NDF and recruitment will be based on \nNDF guidelines. \n(iii)  Institutional development services. These services will prepare and implement \ninstitutional strengthening, capacity building, and road safety programs for the \nprovincial agencies responsible for administering and managing  the provincial \nroad networks. These services will be funded by NDF and recruitment will be \nbased on NDF guidelines. \n(iv)  Gender, HIV and anti-trafficking prevention program. These services include \nthe design and implementation of a program that will target project communities \nfor Phases 1, 2, and 3. Quality- and cost-based selection procedures will apply, \nwith biodata proposals.  \n \n46.  In addition to the above four packages, the Government will recruit and fund consulting \nservices for (i) external monitoring of resettlement implementation, and (ii) unexploded ordnance \nclearance. Recruitment for these services will be based on normal government procedures for \nthe recruitment of consultants.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n47.  To expedite funds flows, PMU-1 will use ADB\u2019s imprest account procedure for eligible \nproject expenditures, except those under a consulting services contract which may use ADB\u2019s \ndirect payment procedure. Payments from PMU-1 for civil works contractors will be made from \nan  imprest  account  held  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB. \nSelected provinces in Phases 2 and 3 will make payments to civil works contractors from \nsecond generation imprest accounts (SGIA). Selection criteria for these provinces will be based \non their capacity to manage an SGIA and maintain adequate records. The initial deposit to the \nimprest account will be based on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of the project \nimplementation or $5,000,000, whichever is lower. The amount to be deposited into each of the \nSGIAs  shall  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  the  PDOT\u2019s  6-month  estimated  expenditure  or \n$100,000, whichever is lower. The imprest account and SGIAs will be established, managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January \n2001, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \nBorrower and ADB. The statement of expenditure (SOE) will be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures  and  liquidate  advances  to  the  imprest  account  to  ensure  speedy  project \nimplementation. The ceiling for the SOE is $100,000 per payment. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  PMU-1 will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  the  financing  resources  received,  the \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, an audit of resettlement expenditures, and the use of local \nfunds. Within 6 months of the close of the each year, PMU-1 will submit audited annual project \naccounts to ADB, which provide a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures \nmade. Annual project accounts will be audited by an auditor acceptable to ADB, and the ", "14 \nauditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB before commencement of work. The audit \nresults will be submitted to ADB on an annual basis. \n \n49.  Regular progress reports on the Project will be prepared by PMU-1 and submitted to \nADB  every  quarter.  They  will  include  a  description  of  the  physical  progress,  status  of \nimplementation of resettlement plans, procurement and contractual status, and highlights of any \nimplementation  issues.  The  progress  reports  should  also  contain  a  summary  of  project \naccounts, including details of the latest project expenditures and contract amounts. These \nreports will include an evaluation of progress in implementing the Project. Within 3 months of \nphysical  completion  of  the  project,  PMU-1  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report \ncovering details of the project implementation, costs, and an evaluation of the Project\u2019s success \nin meeting performance targets. \n \n50.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nPMU-1. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  PMU-1,  assisted  by  the  consultants,  will  establish  systematic  project  performance \nmonitoring and analysis throughout the life of the Project in accordance with ADB's Project \nPerformance  Management  System  Handbook,  integrating  it  with  the  existing  management \ninformation system. Initially, the monitoring system will develop and conduct sample surveys to \nestablish baseline data for subsequent performance monitoring and will establish pre-project \nsocial and economic living conditions for the direct project beneficiaries. A second survey will be \ncarried out on project completion and a third survey after a period of not less than 2 years after \nproject completion. The baseline and impact surveys will include appropriate control areas and \nwill  assess  all  interventions  under  the  project,  including  resettlement  and  other  safeguard \ninterventions that affect the livelihood of project beneficiaries. In addition, a set of indicators \nreflecting transport costs, tariffs and mobility will be developed to assess the effects of improved \naccess to the area. District indicators will include agricultural productivity, economic activity, and \nhealth  and  education  indicators.  The  impacts  of  development  on  the  poor  resulting  from \nimproved road access will receive particular attention. \n \n8.  Project Review \n52.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of project implementation will be \ncarried out.  Representatives of ADB, the Government, and NDF will take part in the review.  \nThe review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections.  \n ", "15 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n53.  The project will promote economic growth and social development in inaccessible rural \nareas with a high incidence of poverty. The project will relieve the isolation of these areas by \nreducing travel cost and travel time, and eliminating traffic disruption during the wet season. It \nwill enable continuous trade and economic exchange, and uninterrupted access to schools, \nmedical facilities, and other social and civil services. The direct benefits will be (i) savings in \nvehicle operating costs and (ii) savings in passenger time costs. The indirect benefits will be \n(i) induced lower input and consumer prices and (ii) greater economic activity in the project \narea. However, the indirect benefits cannot be estimated with precision and, therefore, they \nhave not been taken into account in the quantitative assessment of net benefits. \n \n54.  Based on the assessment of the direct net benefits only, the project\u2019s economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) has been estimated at 22.3%. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the nine \nroad networks that were examined have EIRRs ranging from 12.5% to 43.6%. Sensitivity testing \nindicates that the economic viability of the project is robust against perceived project risks. The \nswitching values14 for the overall project are estimated as a 98% increase in capital cost, or a \n52% decrease in vehicle operating cost savings, or a decrease in traffic growth by 7%. Neither \nreducing passenger time savings nor delaying project benefits will reduce net benefits to the \npoint that the Project is no longer economically feasible. \n \n55.  The incidence of poverty in the project provinces ranges from 16% to 53% depending on \nthe province, against a national average of 29%. Poverty is highest in the central highlands \n(52%) and the northern coastal area (44%), and lowest in the southern coastal area (25%). \nRural poverty is substantially higher than urban poverty, ranging from 34% to 65% depending \non the province, which is significantly above the national average (urban poverty in the project \nprovinces ranges from 11% to 24%). The project will increase accessibility in rural areas by \nimproving  the  links  from  economic  and  social  centers  to  inaccessible  communities,  which \ncurrently suffer slow, expensive and often interrupted access to services and facilities. The \nproject roads have been selected on a network basis to ensure that the rural areas they serve \nare securely connected to centers of economic exchange and social service delivery. This will \n(i) encourage agricultural production beyond subsistence farming;15 (ii) reduce the cost of food \nfor the landless because of both increased local production and a greater inflow of food items at \nlower cost, which is important since food poverty remains high in the project area;16 (iii) improve \naccess  to  nonfarm  employment  opportunities,  which  will  help  reduce  dependency  on \nsubsistence  agriculture  and  seasonal  labor;  (iv)  improve  access  to  health  facilities  and \nmedication, which will reduce the risk and severity of health hazards; and (v) improve access to \neducation, which increases the chances that the young can increase their future earnings \npotential. The ability of the public sector to provide these services efficiently will be enhanced by \n                                                 \n14  A switching value identifies the percentage change in a variable for the economic net present value to become \nzero, the EIRR to fall to the cut-off rate, and the project decision to change. \n15 The validity of this mechanism in Viet Nam has been demonstrated in several studies, including an ADB RETA \n(ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty \nReduction.  Manila  [RETA-5947])  and  the  Viet  Nam  Living  Standards  Survey  (VLSS),  which  is  a  periodic, \ncomprehensive household survey carried out in 1993, 1998, and most recently in 2002), which\u2015in 1993\u2015found \nthat agricultural production and productivity drops rapidly when the distance from the farm to a trafficable road is \nmore than 3 km. \n16 Food poverty refers to the very poor, people who cannot afford a diet of 2,100 calories per day. The incidence of \nfood poverty is 9.0% in the southern coastal area, 17.5% in the northern coastal area, and 29.5% in the central \nhighlands. ", "16 \nbetter road access. The Project\u2019s impact on poverty has been quantified by examining the share \nof total project net benefits that will accrue to the poor. The distributional analysis indicates that \nthe project yields a poverty impact ratio of 0.46. The high poverty impact ratio reflects a high \nincidence of poverty among direct beneficiaries17 and a substantial net transfer of resources \nfrom the economy at large to the project area.  \n \nB.  Project Impacts \n56.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement.  The Project will require the acquisition of mostly \nagricultural land, typically in narrow strips along one or both sides of the existing road alignment.  \nThere will be no physical displacement of houses.  However, secondary structures (fences, \ntoilets, kitchens), graves, crops, and trees will be affected by the road improvement as set out in \nparagraph 24. Adverse impacts will be mitigated by satisfactory resettlement planning and \nimplementation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  the \nresettlement policy framework adopted for this Project.  The objective is to improve or at least \nrestore living standards, income-earning capacity, and production levels of affected people.  \nSpecial assistance will be provided to the poorest and most vulnerable people to help them \nimprove their socioeconomic status. \n \n57.  Ethnic Minorities.  The impacts on ethnic minorities in Phases 1 and 2 will be limited.  \nMany of the roads are in poor condition and pass through sparsely populated rural areas, but \nthe roads have been in existence for some time, providing access for the ethnic minority \ncommunities, although some are closed for periods of days during the rainy season.  Overall, \nmost  ethnic  minorities  along  the  project  roads  live  among  majority  Kinh  people  and  are \nassimilated to varying degrees. In Lam Dong province, where the ethnic minority population is \nsignificant,  an  ethnic  minority  specific  action  (EMSA)  has  been  incorporated  into  the  draft \nresettlement  plan  to  provide  for  consultations  in  ethnic  languages.  An  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment framework has also been prepared to guide the preparation of the EMSA and \nEMDPs in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n \n58.  Environment.  The environmental impacts of the subprojects will be limited, as the civil \nworks will generally be restricted to rehabilitation and upgrading of existing roads. Upgrading \nworks will generally be along the same alignment as the existing roads but short sections of new \nroad will be constructed to improve alignments and to address safety concerns. In addition, the \nProject includes some subprojects that may affect nature reserves or other protected areas and \nrelated ecological resources.  IEEs for sample subprojects have been conducted and mitigation \nmeasures  and  monitoring  programs  were  proposed  in  the  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs) as part of the IEEs to address those potential impacts. With careful \nimplementation of the proposed EMPs and good engineering practices (such as spoil disposal, \nerosion  control,  quarry  and  borrow  sites  selection,  and  management  and  rehabilitation), \nenvironmental impacts will be reduced to acceptable level.  Further risks are minimized by \nhaving the environmental selection criteria in place for future subprojects and by conducting \nIEEs  for  the  selected  subprojects,  as  specified  under  ADB's  sector  loan  environmental \nassessment  requirements.  IEEs  will  be  prepared  for  all  subprojects  based  on  agreed \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures. Within the central region, there are areas \nwith significant unexploded ordnance and surveys will be undertaken to determine the extent of \ncontamination. All unexploded ordnance will be cleared. \n \n                                                 \n17 The project road user survey found that 47.3% of road users were poor. Of these, 31% live just below the poverty \nline while 16.3% were very poor. ", "17 \nC.  Project Risks \n59.  Sustainability. With a cost of $138 million, the Project represents about 5% of MOT's \nplanned annual program. Over the period 1999\u20132002, the national budget has funded about \n65%  of  total  commitments  in  the  transport  sector  through  the  annual  budgeting  process. \nGovernment support to the transport sector will continue and the Government has confirmed \nthat  counterpart  funds  for  donor-assisted  projects  will  be  allocated  on  a  priority  basis. \nMaintenance of the project roads will be the responsibility of the provincial authorities. By \ninternational  standards,  funding  for  road  maintenance  is  low  but  systems  are  required  to \ndetermine the actual needs. As an interim measure, the provincial roads sector policy action \nplan requires that by project completion the provinces will have increased the amount allocated \nto provincial road networks by 100% from that allocated in 2004. On average this would equate \nto a 10% increase in the annual provincial budget allocated to roads. These funds will be \nallocated from each provincial government\u2019s annual budget allocation from the national budget. \nFor  the  longer  term,  the  institutional  development  services  under  the  Project  include  a \ncomponent  to  establish  planning  and  maintenance  systems  within  the  provincial  road \nauthorities.  \n \n60.  Available funds currently cover about 50% of road maintenance requirements in Viet \nNam. As Viet Nam maintains ADB-financed roads in accordance with the loan covenants, this \nwould  imply  that  other  parts  of  the  road  network  are  neglected.  The  problem  is  that \ninfrastructure development is needed to enable economic growth but initial utilization of the \ninfrastructure is light, which curtails the scope for financing from user charges. Funding from the \nGovernment\u2019s  general  tax  revenue  is  equally  constrained.  The  funding  problem  will  be \ntemporary and will last until economic growth increases general tax revenues and the number of \ntransport users. Based on current trends, Viet Nam is likely to reach breakeven with respect to \nroad maintenance funding in about 10 years. Thus, adequate funds should be available by the \ntime major maintenance is required for the project roads. The World Bank is undertaking a road \nmaintenance financing study to review the scope for reducing the timeframe until breakeven and \nthe possibilities for supplementary funding until it is attained. Based on this assessment, the \nProject is considered to be sustainable. \n \n61.  Project Implementation. To mitigate the risk of delays in starting the Project, advance \nactions for the recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil works have been approved. \nFurther, in order to allow preparations for the award of civil works contracts to be expedited, the \nGovernment of Viet Nam has asked for retroactive financing be applied to the civil works \npreparation consulting services. To ensure that sufficient numbers of qualified contractors are \navailable  a  survey  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation  to  confirm  that  suitable \ncontractors  existed.  Procedures  developed  under  ongoing  projects  have  been  adopted  to \nensure that bidders for civil works contracts have the capacity to implement the contract. Based \non the experience of previous projects, appropriate consulting services resources have been \nprovided to assist the executing and implementing agencies to implement the Project in a timely \nmanner and to ensure that quality and cost control measures are effective. Consulting services \nresources include specialists to help the executing and implementing agencies to manage \nresettlement,  environmental,  ethnic  minority  development  and  social  action  plans.  These \nresources will also assist in ensuring that the safeguard policies are complied with. Other \nconcerns are that the Project will increase the potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS and other \nSTIs because of the influx of construction workers and greater contact with the rest of the \ncountry as a result of the road improvements. This potential risk will be mitigated or minimized \nthrough  a  program  to  increase  awareness  and  provide  preventive  measures  for  local \ncommunities, mobile populations, and construction workers. On previous projects, the provision ", "18 \nof counterpart funds and staff has been adequate and timely and provision of such funds is \nconsidered a minor risk in the Project. \n \n62.  Project Operation. After construction, there is a risk that PPCs will not incorporate road \nmaintenance management systems into their business practices and will not provide sufficient \nadditional funds to enable regular maintenance of the roads. To mitigate this risk, the Project \nincludes a component to help the PDOTs to carry out core road management activities. The \ntechnical assistance will address the preparation of provincial road network plans, and the \nimplementation of provincial road maintenance management processes, The Government has \ngiven assurances that, by project completion, (i) the PDOTs will use the road maintenance \nmanagement system developed as part of the institutional development services, and (ii) that \nthe PPCs will increase road maintenance budget allocations for provincial road networks by \n100% from that allocated in 2004. As noted above, initial maintenance requirements for the \nproject roads will be modest and major maintenance should not be necessary until about 10 \nyears after construction work has been completed. \n \n63.  With the completion of the project roads, there is a risk of an increase in the number and \nseverity of road accidents. To mitigate this, the institutional development services include pilot \nroad safety programs for three provinces to extend the national road safety strategy down to the \nprovincial level.  \n \n64.  Other risks include lower-than-expected traffic and inadequate transfer of savings in \nvehicle operation costs to users of transport services. As part of the economic analysis for the \nProject, sensitivity analyses were performed that included reducing traffic growth forecasts by \n2%. These analyses showed that even though this level of reduction reduced the EIRR for \nindividual roads below 12%, the overall Project remained robustly viable. Inadequate transfer of \nsavings to users of transport services is considered to be a minor risk given the assessment \nduring project preparation that transport services in the project area were competitive. Lesser \nrisks  are  failure  of  transport  provision  and  failure  of  agricultural  development  because  of \nunrelated constraints. Neither risk is considered likely to materialize, given the findings of the \npreparatory TA and previous project experience.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n65.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances included in ADB loan agreements:  \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n1.  Subproject Selection \n66.  A  road  section  subproject  will  be  eligible  for  financing  under  the  loan  if  it:  (i)  is \neconomically, technically, and environmentally feasible and has an economic internal rate of \nreturn greater than 12%; (ii) has received all applicable governmental clearances; and (iii) \ncomplies with ADB\u2019s and the procedural requirements of the Government of Viet Nam, and \nADB\u2019s resettlement, ethnic minorities and environment policies.  A proposed road subproject will \nbe excluded from the Project if the road (i) connects to an international border, or (ii) will cause \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts.   \n ", "19 \n2.  Road Sector \n67.  MOT will implement the provincial road sector policy action plan prepared and agreed \nupon with ADB.  A copy of the provincial policy action plan is in Appendix 3. In particular, MOT \nwill ensure that: (i) for all project provinces, the PPCs increase road maintenance budget \nallocations for provincial road networks by 100% by project completion, using 2004 as the base \nyear for determining compliance; (ii) PDOTs in ten Provinces (i.e., Binh Thuan, Da Nang, Dak \nLak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, Khanh Hoa, Kon Tum, Lam Dong, Ninh Thuan, and Quang Nam \nProvinces)  will  utilize,  by  project  completion,  the  road  maintenance  management  system \ndeveloped as part of the institutional development services; (iii) PDOTs and MOT incorporate \nroad  safety  audit  recommendations  developed  under  the  Project  into  the  road  network \nimprovements resulting from the Project; and (iv) PDOTs adopt an open competitive bidding \nprocess for at least 50% of the periodic maintenance program in the Project provinces by the \nend of the Project. \n \n3.  Resettlement  \n68.  MOT  will  be  responsible  for  the  timely  acquisition  of  the  land  required  for  each \nsubproject and for compensation and, if required, relocation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of \npeople affected by any subproject.  MOT will be responsible for preparing a new resettlement \nplan for any subproject requiring one in accordance with the resettlement framework agreed \nbetween ADB and the Government and will submit such resettlement plans to ADB for approval \nprior to implementation. The preparation and implementation of resettlement plans will be in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  MOT  will \nprovide ADB with quarterly monitoring reports on the land acquisition and resettlement process \nand will provide a report immediately following completion of Resettlement Plan implementation. \n \n69.  ADB will not approve award of any civil works contracts for any road to be financed from \nthe loan proceeds unless (i) the MOT has satisfactorily completed for each road a DMS and \nvalidated compensation unit rates for all categories of losses and allowances; (ii) the MOT has \nprovided to ADB a final database of affected persons, summary of the updated DMS data, and \nreplacement  cost  tables  for  each  subproject;  and  (iii)  an  updated  resettlement  plan, \nincorporating subparagraphs (i) and (ii), has been submitted to and approved by ADB. \n \n70.  MOT will ensure that civil works contractors are not issued a notice of possession of site \nfor construction work for any specific section of a road unless for that section MOT has (a) \nsatisfactorily completed, in accordance with the approved RP, compensation payment and \nrelocation to new sites; and (b) ensured that rehabilitation assistance is in place and the area \nrequired for civil works is free of encumbrances. \n \n4.  Social Safeguards \n71.  If MOT determines that a subproject will affect any minority group or ethnic minority, then \nMOT will ensure that Ethnic Minority Specific Actions (EMSA) are prepared if the negative \nimpacts on ethnic minorities are found to be limited.  The Government will ensure that EMDPs \nare prepared and implemented if the impacts on ethnic minorities are significant.  Preparation of \nEMSAs and EMDPs will be in accordance with the approved Ethnic Minority Development \nFramework, ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, and in coordination with the Government\u2019s \nethnic minorities programs and will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. \n ", "20 \n5.  Environmental Management \n72.  For each subproject for which an IEE has not been prepared, the relevant PDOT will \nprepare an IEE, which includes an EMP specific to that subproject.  MOT will ensure that IEEs: \n(i) are based on the sample IEEs prepared during project preparation, (ii) include details of local \nconsultation carried out before and during IEE preparation, and (iii) are prepared prior to civil \nworks contracts being awarded for the subproject.   \n \n73.  The MOT will ensure that the contract documents for all civil works under the Project \ninclude specific measures as indicated in the SIEE and IEE and in accordance with ADB's \nEnvironment Policy to mitigate negative environmental impacts caused by the construction and \nto give due consideration to prevention of damage to the natural environment in the design, \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of project facilities. The Government will ensure that \nfor contaminated areas MOT conduct an unexploded ordnance survey and clearance and certify \nthat this work has been completed before commencement of civil works. \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n74.  MOT will establish a systematic project performance monitoring and analysis system for \nuse throughout the project period.  A Road Management Information System will be established \nat each PDOT to collect the required data. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n75.  The NDF Loan Agreement for approximately $11 million has been agreed, signed, and \nmade effective (other than a condition requiring effectiveness of the ADB Loan Agreement). \n \nVI.

Provincial Road Administration \n1.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  responsible  for  the  overall  management  and \ndevelopment  of  the  transport  sector.  Four  administrations  within  MOT\u2014Viet  Nam  Road \nAdministration (VRA), Viet Nam Railways, Viet Nam Inland Waterway Administration, and Viet \nNam National Maritime Bureau\u2014are responsible for roads, railways, inland waterways, and \nports, respectively. The Planning and Investment Department of MOT undertakes overall policy \ncoordination, programming, and budgeting; and sets investment priorities in the transport sector \nwith support from its Center for Statistics and a number of other institutions. At provincial and \ndistrict levels, planning and programming for transport sector investments and operations are \nvested with the provincial departments of transport (PDOT), which are responsible to their \nrespective provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs).  The PDOTs have no direct responsibility to \nMOT, but they have links to MOT to carry out certain works. \n \nB.  Provincial Road Inventory and Condition \n2.  In  the  central  region,  the  road  network  comprises  approximately  84,500  km  with \n6,900 km of national highway, 6,900 km of provincial roads, 16,900 km of district roads, and \n53,800 km of commune roads. Of this network, the 19 PDOTs1 are responsible for 9,018 km of \nprovincial and district roads with 448 long bridges greater than 20 m in length and 3,736 km of \nnational highway with 351 long bridges. As a rule, the district administrations are responsible for \ndistrict roads but in a few provinces the PDOTs are responsible for some district roads.  The \nVRA  has  delegated  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  main  national  highway  to  its \nsubsidiary road maintenance and management units (RRMUs) and the less important national \nhighways to the PDOT.  \n \n3.  From information gathered from the central region PDOT,2 61% of provincial and district \nroads under the PDOT are sealed and 39% are gravel or earth.  Pavement condition ratings for \nthese  same  roads  are:  16.9%,  good;  33.9%,  fair;  34.7%,  poor;  and  14.5%,  very  poor.  \nApproximately one half of the total road length is therefore in poor or very poor condition. \nTypical deficiencies include: road foundations and pavement cross-sections do not meet the \nbasic single-lane Class V standard; poor alignments and narrow bridges and culverts create \nnumerous road safety hazards; cross-drainage is inadequate; and many bridges need to be \nrepaired or replaced; many sections of road are passable only by motorcycle and four-wheel \ndrive vehicle; many roads are closed for long periods during the wet season; international \nroughness index (IRI) on most roads exceeds 10; and the net result is that travel speeds are \nvery low.  Many roads do not have bus transport services because operators are deterred by \nrough road surfaces and freight transport is often limited to cong nongs3 or motorcycles. The \nPDOTs  have  identified  about  4,200  km  of  provincial  and  district  roads  which  need  to  be \nupgraded  to  a  minimum  single-  or  two-lane  standard,  providing  bituminous  surfaces  and \nrepairing or replacing damaged or missing short bridges and culverts.   \n \n                                                 \n1 Da Nang\u2019s road network contains extensive lengths of streets in Da Nang City which are not representative of the \nprovincial roads in the central region. \n2  Information presented in this Appendix was obtained from questionnaires sent to 19 PDOTs.  All PDOTs responded \nbut did not necessarily provide information for every question. \n3  A small domestically manufactured simple truck which is used in rural areas. ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nC.  Road Traffic \n4.  The  provincial  roads  generally  carry  lower  levels  of  traffic  than  national  highways, \nalthough there are some heavily used sections near provincial and district centers.  Traffic \ncounts on a sample of 28 roads show average daily traffic levels in the order of: less than 300 \nmotor  vehicles  (mostly  trucks  and  cong  nongs  with  a  few  buses  and  cars);  500\u20131,500 \nmotorcycles;  and  500\u20132,000  bicycles.  Motorcycles  and  bicycles  are  a  major  means  of \ntransporting goods in rural areas. \n \nD.  Vehicle Registrations \n5.  There  were  approximately  1,292,600  vehicle  registrations  in  17  provinces4  in  2003 \n(Table A1.1).  The number of vehicles, especially motorcycles, increased sharply in 2002 and \nagain in 2003, albeit at a lower rate. There is every indication that the number of vehicles will \ncontinue to increase as people change from bicycles to motorcycles and more cars, buses and \ntrucks are introduced.  \n \nTable A1.1:  Vehicle Registrations in 17 Provinces (2003) \n \nGrowth Rate  Growth Rate \nRegistrations \nVehicle Class  2001\u20132002  2002\u20132003 \n2003 \n(%)  (%) \nMotorcycle  1,228,000  31  13 \nCar, jeep, 4WD  18,300 \n   \nBus  10,200 \n15  11 \nTruck  28,300 \n   \nCong nong, tractor  7,800 \nTotal  1,292,600  30  13 \n4WD = four-wheel drive. \nSource: Viet Nam Road Administration, Ministry of Transport, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Road Safety \n6.  Poor road safety is a serious and growing problem throughout Viet Nam: 16 provinces in \nthe central region reported 3,065 road deaths in 2003, which is equivalent to a rate of 17 deaths \nper annum per 100,000 population or 24 deaths per annum per 10,000 vehicles. In Table A1.2 \nthe data for road deaths is shown by location and mode of transport. These rates are very high, \neven in comparison with many neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, and new initiatives in \nroad  policy  and  management  are  urgently  required.  Most  road  deaths  (60%)  occurred  on \nnational highways but the number of accidents and deaths on provincial roads is expected to \nincrease as well. Road safety audits on a sample of provincial roads revealed that there are \nmany road hazards which should be eliminated as a part of the road improvements made by the \nProject.  The number of reported deaths increased by 19% in 2001\u20132002 and declined by 6% in \n2002\u20132003. \n \nF.  Provincial Road Sector Organization \n7.  The management of roads in each province is the responsibility of a board of directors or \nmanagement board appointed by the PPC. The organizational structure of a typical provincial \nroad sector organization comprises: \n                                                 \n4 Data for Quang Binh and Thua Thien Hue Provinces are not available. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \n \n(i)  PDOT - administration division, planning division, transport management division, \ntraffic inspection division, technical audit unit, vehicle and driver registration unit, \nand provincial project management unit (PPMU); \n(ii)  road and bridge maintenance management companies for maintenance works; \n(iii)  road and bridge construction companies for construction works; \n(iv)  road consulting companies for surveys and design; \n(v)  passenger transport companies; and \n(vi)  freight transport companies. \n \nTable A1.2:  Distribution of Road Accidents \n \nLocation                     Percent  Type of Transport      Percent \nNational highway  60  Pedestrian  4 \nProvincial road  22  Bicycle, motorcycle  63 \nDistrict road  13  Motor vehicle  33 \nCommune road  5 \n  Source: Viet Nam Road Administration, Ministry of Transport, and Asian Development   \n  Bank estimates. \n \nG.  Road Budgets \n8.  The  PDOTs  receive  budget  allocations  from  the  PPCs  for  the  development  and \nmaintenance of provincial and district roads under their jurisdiction and from the MOT for the \nnational highways they operate and maintain on behalf of the VRA. Budget allocations for 2004 \nfor 16 provinces are summarized in the table below. \n \nTable A1.3: 2004 Provincial Budget Allocations for Roads \n \nCategory  Provincial Roads           Percent  National Highways under PDOT    Percent \nAdministration, routine and  $5.9 million  $5.7 million \n11  7 \nperiodic maintenance  $700/km  $1,970/km \nRehabilitation and  $23.2 million  $13.0 million \n44  16 \nimprovement  $4,343/km  $6,273/km \nNew construction  $23.5 million  45  $60.6 million  77 \nTotal budget  $52.6 million  $82.3 million \n   \nTotal road length  8,390 km  2,880 km \nkm = kilometer, PDOT = Provincial Departments of Transport. \nSource: Viet Nam Road Administration, Ministry of Transport, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9.  The information received from the PDOTs shows the amount allocated for routine and \nperiodic maintenance of provincial roads is $700/km. Other PDOT sources reported that the \nactual expenditure per km is approximately 50\u201360% of this amount, and is only 50% of the \namount required. By international standards this level of expenditure is too low to maintain \nroads at a reasonable standard, which is borne out by the findings of the road and bridge \ninspections carried out under the PPTA.5 \n   \n10.  The total allocation of $52.6 million to provincial roads is a significant proportion of the \ntotal allocation to the PDOTs. Further, the Project\u2019s investment of approximately $115 million \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

(TA4034-VIE) ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nover 4 years is almost double the current annual PDOT budgets for provincial road rehabilitation \nand improvements.  The increasing expenditure on road improvements, in combination with the \nunderfunding of road maintenance, underlines the need to introduce an effective provincial road \nand bridge asset management capacity at the PDOT level complementing the efforts being \nexpended on national highways.   \n \nH.  Road Construction Industry \n11.  Most road and bridge maintenance companies are fully state-owned enterprises (SOEs) \nwhich are contracted for maintenance planning and execution by the PDOT. The capacity of \nthese  SOEs  varies.  Some  are  limited  to  small-scale  works  while  others  are  capable  of \nundertaking large complex projects. The PPCs are now converting many of their construction, \nconsulting, and transport SOEs into joint stock companies (JSCs) with different degrees of state \nshareholdings.  The  construction  industry  possesses  the  plant,  engineering,  and  materials \nresources needed to meet the road construction and maintenance requirements in the central \nregion. There are approximately 400 construction companies operating in the 19 central region \nprovinces.  About  40%  are  small  private  companies  with  an  annual  turnover  of  less  than \n$500,000. Although small, these private companies can grow if they have access to a pipeline \nof work, as has been demonstrated in other provincial road projects in Viet Nam. The table \nbelow shows the breakdown by type of ownership and the reported annual value of work \ncompleted.   \n \nTable A1.4: Distribution of Annual Value of Work by Ownership. \n \n     Annual Value of Work Completed in Past One Year ($'000)  \nOwnership               \n<$500  $500-1,000  $1,000-6,000  >$6,000  Total \nState-Owned Enterprise    15  9  42  13  79   \nJoint Stock Company  5  18  32  3  58 \nPrivate Company  164  59  37  1  261 \nSubtotal  184  86  111  17  398 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nI.  Institutional Capacity and Strengthening Requirements \n12.  A  review  of  existing  donor-funded  road  projects  show  there  is  a  large  amount  of \ntechnical assistance being provided to strengthen road sector agencies at national, provincial, \ndistrict, and commune levels. The donor community has realized that there are overlaps and a \nneed  for  close  coordination  among  the  project  executing  agencies  to  avoid  conflicts  and \nduplication.  Nevertheless,  it  appears  that  none  of  the  current  institutional  strengthening \nprograms  is  focusing  on  the  PDOT\u2019s  management  of  provincial  roads.  Workshops  and \ninvestigations carried out during the PPTA (footnote 5) showed there is a need within the PDOT \nto ensure that \n \n(i)  effective  road  network  planning  processes  are  in  place  covering  national, \nprovincial, district, and commune roads in each province; \n(ii)  effective maintenance management systems and processes covering provincial \nroads are in place; \n(iii)  staff are trained and capable of operating and sustaining these systems; \n(iv)  road safety programs are introduced at the provincial level; and \n(v)  sufficient budget support is given by the PPCs to maintain the provincial roads. \n ", " \n2\n8\n \nROAD SUBSECTOR AND PROVINCIAL ROADS POLICY ACTION PLANS \n  A\np\np\nTable A3.1: National Road Sector Policy Matrix  e\nn\n  d\nix\nPolicy Objective  Key Issues and Actions Taken  Future Actions   3\n1.

Technical Description of Subprojects \n1.   The civil works will comprise improvements to provincial and district road networks in \nthe 19 provinces in the central region. Work will take place in three phases.  Phases 1 and 2 will \nbe improvements to 544 km of provincial and district roads in nine provinces. Networks for \nPhase 3 will be identified in due course. Generally, the project roads are narrow and have bad \nor poor unpaved surfaces. Some roads are impassable for three to four months during the wet \nseason. Most of the roads are low-volume carrying no more than 100\u2013200 motor vehicles per \nday, although in others the levels of motorcycle and bicycle traffic can be high.  The proposed \nimprovements will take the form of widening and/or raising the road foundation and providing a \nsealed single-lane or two-lane carriageway.  Most improvements will be constructed along the \nexisting road alignment and within the right-of-way. A road safety audit conducted on selected \nroads revealed that some road sections are unsafe and need to be realigned. Therefore, the \nproposed improvements include short diversions to eliminate dangerous alignments, some short \nbypasses around densely developed villages and improvements at intersections with major \nroads. \n \nB.  Design Standards for Project Roads \n2.  The highway design criteria adopted are in accordance with the Viet Nam publication \nTCVN 4054: 1998 Highway Specifications for Design.1 These standards are consistent with \nstandard international practices adopted by the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation  Officials  (AASHTO)  design  standards.  The  road  design  will  be  based  on \nVietnamese methods and checked against the design methods given in AASHTO Guide for \nDesign of Pavement Structures2 and Transport Research Laboratory Overseas Road Note 31.3  \n \n3.  The choice of surfacing takes into account such factors as traffic, soil type, and rainfall. It \nis envisaged that double bituminous surface treatment (DBST) will be adequate for all the \ndistrict roads and the low-volume provincial roads included in Phases 1 and 2. Some higher-\nvolume roads will require asphaltic concrete (AC) pavement. For the low-volume roads, DBST \nwill be the most economical solution, since the bitumen content and cost is low and the thin, \nflexible surface will resist damage from any overweight vehicles.  For medium-volume roads and \nintersections  with  major  roads,  full-depth  bituminous  surfacing  is  likely  to  be  the  most \neconomical solution. Cement concrete roads are unlikely to be economical except in locations \nwhere  occasional  flooding  may  occur.  In  these  locations,  it  is  recommended  that  light \nreinforcement is used in the concrete to distribute loads and to eliminate cracking.   \n \n4.    There is insufficient detailed traffic and geotechnical information available at the PPTA \n(footnote 1 in the main text) stage to choose the most economic pavement option for each \nsubproject road. The most practical course of action is to evaluate pavement design options at \nthe  detailed  design  stage  using  reliable  data  on  traffic,  axle  loads,  pavement  strength, \nconstruction materials, and updated unit costs.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Transport. 1998.

Transport Research Laboratory.  ", "  Appendix 5  35 \nC.  General Design Considerations \n \n5.  The major improvements to the project roads are as follows. \n \n(i)  Raise the embankment a minimum of 0.5 m above natural ground level or 0.6 m \nabove highest flood level to meet hydraulic requirements. \n(ii)  Class V Roads: widen the existing roadway to 3.5 m with 1.5 m shoulders. The \nshoulders would normally be gravel in rural areas and paved in urban areas and \noutside schools and hospitals etc.  A capping layer would be provided where \nrequired with a granular base and subbase, overlaid with bitumen.  \n(iii)  Class IV Roads: widen the existing roadway to 5.5 m with 1.5 m shoulders. The \nshoulders would normally be gravel in rural areas and paved in urban areas and \noutside schools and hospitals, etc.  A capping layer would be provided where \nrequired with a granular base and subbase, overlaid with bitumen.  \n(iv)  Class V Roads: improve horizontal and vertical alignment to allow a minimum \ndesign speed of 40 km/h on level terrain and 20 km/h in mountainous terrain. \n(v)  Class IV Roads: improve horizontal and vertical alignment to allow a minimum \ndesign speed of 60 km/h on level terrain and 40 km/h in mountainous terrain. \n(vi)  Provide guard barriers at bridge approaches and on high embankments.  \n(vii)  Provide road furniture including signs, delineator posts, kilometer posts, etc. and \nadditional signs where there is high pedestrian activity.  \n(viii)  Provide pedestrian crossings and speed controls at key locations outside schools \nand hospitals and in other areas where there are high pedestrian movements. \n \nD.  Bridges and Culverts \n6.  Most bridges on project roads under Phases 1 and 2 are in good condition or need only \nminor repairs. In several cases, bridges will be replaced because their width is substandard for \nthe level of road improvement proposed. There are three bridges longer than 20 m in Phases 1 \nand 2. Two of these will be repaired and one bridge (32 m) will be replaced. \n \n7.  Proper  cross-drainage  structures  will  be  provided  where  necessary,  to  ensure  all-\nweather connectivity and to prevent environmental erosion, flooding, or other damage. Box, \nslab, or circular culverts will be provided at suitable intervals and at suitable sizes determined by \nhydrological and hydraulic calculations. \n \nF.  Unexploded Ordnance Clearance \n8.  A study of unexploded ordnance clearance requirements for Phases 1 and 2 subproject \nroads  was  conducted  by  domestic  specialists  associated  with  the  Headquarters  of  Army \nEngineering and licensed by the Ministry of Defense. The study found subproject roads fell into \nfour zone classifications (KV1 to KV4) with all roads in Quang Tri province classified as KV4, the \nhighest risk classification. The study recommended that all Phases 1 and 2 subproject roads will \nrequire surveying and clearance at an estimated cost of $950,000.  \n  \nG.  Environmental Management Plan \n9.  The project initial environmental examination has recommended a series of mitigation \nmeasures that take the form of good engineering practices. These will be included in the \ncontract  technical  specification.  Otherwise,  there  are  no  special  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures that need to be incorporated into the designs of the subproject roads. \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \nSUBPROJECT SELECTION AND PROCESSING ARRANGEMENTS \n \nA.  Provincial Road Network Master Plans \n1.  The definition and selection of subproject road networks for inclusion in the Project will \nbe based on the long lists of proposed subprojects (road sections) prepared by the provincial \ndepartments of transport (PDOTs). The provinces have already prepared long lists of proposed \nroad and bridge subprojects during the PPTA (footnote 1 of main text). A workshop was held \nwith representatives of the PDOTs to review each province\u2019s requirements and agree upon the \nlong lists. The provinces\u2019 needs are expected to change over the duration of the Project. \nTherefore, the PDOT will be requested to update their provincial road network master plans and \nroad improvement programs to ensure their long lists are consistent with provincial economic \nand social development plans.  \n \n2.  The total long list of road improvements and new or replacement bridges required in the \nprovincial road networks in the central region is estimated to be $260 million ($200 million for \nroads and $60 million for bridges), of which the Project will select approximately 45%.  \n \nB.  Selection of Subproject Networks from Provincial Long Lists \n3.  The  long  lists  will  be  scrutinized  by  MOT  with  the  assistance  of  the  project \nimplementation consultant for completeness and consistency, and to identify suitable networks. \nIn  each  province  the  updated  long  list  of  networks  will  be  prioritized  using  a  multicriteria \nmethodology to assess the individual network\u2019s potential for generating economic benefits, and \nfor achieving the social objectives of the project following the methodology set out in the \nsubproject selection and preparation manual prepared under the PPTA (footnote 1 in the main \ntext).  The  criteria  adopted  to  form  the  basis  for  selection  of  subproject  networks  were \n(i) population served, (ii) the incidence of poverty in the area of influence, (iii) traffic intensity, \n(iv) the general surface condition of the existing roads, and (v) the number of days of road \nclosure per year. No network will include any road links that connect to an international border. \n \n4.  The networks selected for inclusion in the Project will be checked in the field by MOT \nand the project implementation consultant to confirm the results of the selection methodology \nand the overall suitability of the subproject.  \n \n5.  In addition, the selection process will consider other road sector projects in the central \nregion, including the Government\u2019s development plans for national highways, to maximize the \nbenefits of the Project. In addition, the JBIC Weak Bridge Project, which includes replacement \nlong bridges in the provincial road networks, will be reviewed during the selection process. \n \nC.  Economic Analysis of Improvement Options \n6.  Field surveys will be conducted to collect road and bridge inventory and condition data, \ntraffic counts, preliminary environmental screening data, and social surveys. These data will be \nused  to  identify  improvement  options  and  the  proposed  subproject  network  will  then  be \nsubjected to a detailed economic evaluation. The evaluation will be based on the results of field \nsurveys and classified traffic counts that produced an inventory for each project road and traffic \ndata for analysis by the HDM-4 model.1 This analysis will make use of calibration factors for \n                                                 \n1 The Highway Development and Management tool version 4 (HDM-4) is the acknowledged reference model for \neconomic assessment of road projects. ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nHDM-4 derived to reflect local conditions, in particular vehicle speeds and the effects of the very \nhigh proportions of motorcycles in total traffic flow. \n \n7.  The economic evaluation will be made by comparing the \u201cwith\u201d and the \u201cwithout\u201d project \ncases. The cost-benefit analysis will be performed on a network basis (rather than on the basis \nof individual road sections) to ensure that the Project produces coherent networks that connect \nto major roads, thus ensuring that the project area receives effective all-year connectivity to \nmarkets and services. \n \n8.  The evaluation of the project networks will allow for a 2-year construction period starting \nin 2006, or later for subsequent phases, followed by a benefit period of 20 years. The results of \nthe selection process and economic analysis will be submitted to MOT and ADB for approval \nbefore the start of detailed design and preparation of bid documents. \n \nD.  Detailed Design and Contract Packages \n9.  Following approval by MOT and ADB, the engineering investigations will be conducted \nand detailed designs (drawings and specifications), bid documents, and cost estimates will be \nprepared and submitted to the PDOTs (who will be responsible for the day-to-day supervision of \ncivil works and will be the road authority upon completion of the civil works) and MOT for \napproval.  The works will be grouped into practical contract packages not exceeding $2 million \nfor  local  competitive  bidding.  All  necessary  documents  will  be  then  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval. \n \nE.  Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) \n10.  Before any candidate subproject is selected and an IEE conducted, it will be screened \nusing a list of environmental selection criteria. These criteria have been prepared in the sample \nsubproject IEE prepared by the PPTA and have been agreed upon by both ADB and Project \nManagement Unit No 1 (PMU-1). Subprojects categorized as Category A will be screened out. \nThe selected candidate subprojects will be assessed and reviewed by MOT and, for each \nselected subproject, an IEE (including site-specific EMP) will be carried out and submitted to \nADB  for  approval.  At  the  same  time,  the  approval  procedure  of  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  the  Environment  (MONRE)  and  related  safeguard  requirements  of  the \nGovernment will be followed. \n \nF.  Resettlement \n11.  Resettlement plans will be prepared following detailed designs where the subproject \nrequires land acquisition and resettlement. Designs will take account of productive land uses \nand the location of houses. Where relevant they will realign and adjust the pavement width and \nalignment and associated works, and incorporate the drainage into the road shoulder to reduce \nthe need for major land acquisition, physical displacement of houses, structures, and other \nimprovements. \n \n12.  Preparation  of  resettlement  plans  will  be  based  on  (i)  resettlement  screening; \n(ii) consultation  and  participation  programs,  (iii)  census,  inventory  of  losses,  detailed \nmeasurement, and socioeconomic surveys; (iv) replacement cost study and establishment of \ncompensation rates; (v) formulation of appropriate rehabilitation measures for severely affected, \nvery  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups;  (vi)  preparation  of  budget,  implementation \n ", "38  Appendix 6 \narrangements, monitoring, and implementation schedule in coordination with the civil works \nschedule.  \n \n13.  Resettlement plans will be prepared in accordance with the ADB's Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995)  and  the  approved  resettlement  policy  framework.  To  ensure  that \nresettlement planning is completed in a timely manner, it will be a condition for the award of \ncontract  that  for  each  road  the  Government  has  (i)  satisfactorily  completed  a  detailed \nmeasurement survey and validated compensation unit rates for all categories of losses and \nallowances; (ii) provided to ADB a final database of affected persons, summary of the updated \ndetailed  measurement  survey  data,  and  replacement  cost  tables  for  each  road;  and  (iii) \nsubmitted  an  updated  resettlement  plan,  incorporating  the  above,  and  that  this  has  been \napproved by ADB. To ensure that implementation of each resettlement plan is effected in a \ntimely manner, it will be a condition that the Government will not issue notices of possession of \nsite  for  any  section  of  a  road  to  begin  construction  work  until  the  Government  has  (i) \nsatisfactorily  completed,  in  accordance  with  the  approved  resettlement  plan,  compensation \npayment and relocation to new sites; and (ii) ensured that rehabilitation assistance is in place \nand the area required for civil works is free of encumbrances. \n \nG.  Ethnic Minorities \n14.  Specific actions for ethnic minorities will be prepared if the impacts on ethnic minorities \nare  identified  but  are  not  considered  to  be  significant.  Ethnic  minority  development  plans \n(EMDPs) will be prepared if the benefits and impacts on ethnic minorities are found to be \nsignificant.  The objectives of the specific actions and the EMDP are to ensure negative effects \non them are mitigated and benefits are enhanced. \n \n15.  Specific activities will include: (i) screening of basic characteristics and issues of ethnic \nminorities in each commune within the zone of influence of the project roads; (ii) social and \ncultural assessment of each commune within the zone of influence; and (iii) full participation of \nthe local communities, committee for ethnic minorities and mountainous areas (CEMMA), local \norganizations and bilateral and NGOs in the preparation and implementation of development \nprograms.   \n \n16.  Specific Actions on ethnic minorities and EMDPs will be prepared in accordance with \nADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples and the approved ethnic minority development framework \n(EMDF).   \n \nH.  Unexploded Ordnance Clearance \n17.  A study by specialists during the PPTA showed that many subproject road sections are \nin areas where there is a high risk from unexploded ordnance.  In these areas surveys and \nclearance will be needed before the construction site can be handed over to the contractors.  \nTherefore, MOT has agreed to contract with one or more specialist companies to conduct these \nsurveys when the road design details are known and to complete them before the contractor \ntakes possession of the construction site.    \n ", "  Appendix 7  39 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The resettlement policy framework (RPF) establishes the policies and procedures for \ncompensation, rehabilitation and resettlement of people affected by the Project. The provisions \nof the RPF will be applicable in all cases where land acquisition and/or resettlement is required \nas part of the implementation of a subproject. \n \nB.  Legal Framework \n2.  The RPF builds on the laws of the Government of Viet Nam, particularly the Land Law \nNo. 13/2003/QH11 and regulations to implement the Law; and, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The Government legislation covers land \nacquisition and resettlement approaches but is not fully consistent with the ADB policy. The \nprovisions of the RPF take precedence over relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam \nwherever  a  gap  exists  between  the  ADB  policy  and  Vietnamese  law,  as  per  Decree \n17/2001/ND-CP. \n \nC.  Project Affected People \n3.  In accordance with ADB policy, affected people (APs) include any person, household, \nfirm, or private institution who, on account of changes resulting from the Project, or any of its \nphases or subprojects, will have its (i) standards of living adversely affected; (ii) right, title, or \ninterest  in  any  house,  land  (including  residential,  agricultural,  nonagricultural,  forest,  salt-\nmaking, and/or grazing land), water resources or any other moveable or fixed assets acquired, \npossessed,  restricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part,  permanently  or \ntemporarily; and/or (iii) business, occupation, place of work, residence, or habitat adversely \naffected, with or without displacement. \n \nD.  Resettlement Objective and Principles \n4.  The overall objective of the Project with respect to land acquisition and resettlement is to \nensure that all people affected by the Project and its subprojects are able to maintain and, \npreferably,  improve  their  pre-project  living  standards  and  income-earning  capacity  through \ncompensation for the loss of physical and nonphysical assets and, as required, other assistance \nand rehabilitation measures.  The following principles have been adopted for the Project to \nguide the compensation and entitlement policy. \n \n(i)  Acquisition of land and other assets and the relocation of affected people will be \nminimized as much as possible by exploring all viable options. \n(ii)  All APs are entitled to compensation at replacement cost for their lost assets, \nincomes, and businesses, including temporary losses or impacts.  \n(iii)  Rehabilitation assistance will be provided to severely affected people and other \nvulnerable groups to assist them to improve or at least restore their pre-project \nliving standards, incomes, and productive capacity. \n(iv)  Particular  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  needs  of  the  poorest  people  and \nvulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment. This may include \nthose without legal title to land or other assets, landless households, households \nheaded  by  females,  the  elderly,  or  disabled  and  other  vulnerable  groups, \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nparticularly ethnic minorities. Appropriate assistance must be provided to help \nthem improve their socioeconomic status. \n(v)  Affected people that lose only part of their physical assets will not be left with a \nportion that will be inadequate to sustain their current standard of living. The \nminimum  size  of  remaining  land  and  structures  will  be  agreed  during  the \nresettlement planning process.  \n(vi)  Lack  of  legal  title  to  affected  assets  will  not  bar  APs  from  entitlement  to \ncompensation  and  assistance  to  achieve  the  stated  objectives  of  this \nResettlement Policy Framework. \n(vii)  As a priority, loss of agricultural land will be compensated with alternative land of \nequal size and productive capacity. If suitable replacement land is not available \nand/or at the \u201cinformed request\u201d of APs, compensation will be paid in cash at \nreplacement value base on current market prices for agricultural land of the same \ncategory (or productive capacity) as the affected land. \n(viii)  Replacement land for agriculture, residential purposes, and businesses will be \nprovided with secure tenure status; all fees, sales taxes, or other surcharges \nassociated with transfer of land title will be waived.  \n(ix)  Compensation for houses and other structures will be determined according to \nreplacement value for materials and labor to rebuild similar structures, at current \nmarket prices in the locality. In determining replacement costs, depreciation of \nassets and salvage value of materials will not be taken into account. \n(x)  In the case of the relocation of APs, replacement houses and/or agricultural land \nwill be located as close as possible to the assets that were lost, and at locations \nacceptable  to  APs.  Relocated  APs  will  receive  relocation  and  transition \nsubsistence allowances.  \n(xi)  Efforts shall be made to maintain, to the extent possible, the existing social and \ncultural institutions of the resettled people and host communities. \n(xii)  APs  will  be  fully  consulted  and  will  participate  in  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of resettlement plans (RPs) for each subproject. The comments \nand suggestions of affected people and communities will be taken into account \nduring the design and implementation phases of resettlement activities. \n(xiii)  Adequate  resources  will  be  identified  and  committed  during  resettlement \nplanning for each subproject and the overall Project. This includes adequate \nbudgetary support fully committed for each subproject and made available to \ncover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation within the agreed implementation period for the subproject; and, \nadequate  human  resources  for  supervision,  liaison,  and  monitoring  of  land \nacquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation activities. \n(xiv)  Appropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system. Monitoring and \nevaluation of the land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation processes and \nthe final outcomes will be conducted by an independent monitoring agency. \n(xv)  Detailed RPs will be translated into Vietnamese or, where necessary, the local \nlanguage and placed in the commune offices for the reference of APs as well as \nother interested groups. \n(xvi)  ADB shall not approve the hand over for commencement of civil works of any \nspecific part of a subproject to be financed from the loan proceeds unless the \nGovernment has satisfactorily completed payment of compensation for affected \nassets and any relocation to new sites, in accordance with the approved RP for \nthe subproject. Rehabilitation measures must also be in place but not necessarily \ncompleted, as these may be ongoing activities. ", "  Appendix 7  41 \nE.  Eligibility \n5.  For  each subproject  that  requires land  acquisition,  the cut-off  date  for  eligibility  for \nentitlements  to  compensation  for  lost  assets  is  defined  as  the  completion  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement survey (DMS). People who move into the subproject area and/or who construct \nassets after the subproject cut-off date are not entitled to compensation or any other form of \nresettlement assistance. They will be requested to vacate premises and dismantle affected \nstructures prior to project implementation. Their dismantled structures will not be confiscated, \nand they will not have to pay any fine or sanction. \n \nF.  Compensation and Entitlement Policy \n7.  The project compensation and entitlement policy is designed to cover compensation for \nlost assets and assistance to restore or enhance livelihoods of all APs. Affected people will not \nonly receive replacement land or cash for land and other assets at replacement value based on \nmarket prices at the time of compensation, but various rehabilitation measures will be available \nto severely affected, very poor and otherwise vulnerable APs. Table A7.1 summarizes the main \ntypes of losses and the support proposed for each type of loss. \n \nG.  Institutional Arrangements \n8.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  with \nresponsibility for planning and implementation delegated to Project Management Unit No 1 \n(PMU-1) and the provincial department of transports (PDOTs). PMU-1 will ensure that Provincial \nResettlement Committees (PRC) are established for each subproject under the direction of the \nProvincial Peoples\u2019 Committee (PPC), as well as resettlement committees at the district and \ncommune levels. The PRC and RCs at lower levels will be responsible to the PDOTs and PMU-\n1 for preparation and implementation of approved RPs. Representatives of the Women\u2019s Union \nand/or the Farmers\u2019 Association will participate actively in RCs at all levels. The PDOT will \nmaintain computerized databases of affected people and assets. \n \n9.  The PPC and PRC will establish compensation rates for the subproject. These rates will \nbe based on annual PPC rates adjusted, as necessary, by the findings of a replacement cost \nsurvey to be conducted by the independent monitoring agency. Compensation rates will be \ncontinuously updated to ensure that APs receive compensation based on full replacement value \nat the time of compensation payments. \n \nH.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n10.  According to ADB policy, APs must be fully consulted and provided with opportunities to \nparticipate in the planning and implementation of land acquisition and resettlement. In addition, \nthey must be informed in an appropriate and timely manner of the outcomes of the planning \nprocess, as well as schedules and procedures for implementation of the RP. PMU-1 and the \nPDOTs will oversee the activities of the PRC and RCs at lower levels to carry out public \ninformation and consultation programs during all stages of the land acquisition and resettlement \nprocess, including public information meetings, participation of APs in the DMS, full disclosure \nof the RP and informing APs about procedures for payment of compensation and, as required, \nrelocation. \n \n11.  Prior to the Management Review Meeting (MRM) for the Project, the RPF was translated \ninto Vietnamese and copies, in both English and Vietnamese languages, were distributed to the \n ", "42  Appendix 7 \nproject  provinces  for  review  and  endorsement.    The  RPF  will  be  uploaded  on  the  ADB \nresettlement website immediately upon Board approval.   \n \n12.  For the four RPs that have been prepared for Phase 1, the following requirements were \nmet prior to MRM:  (i) distribution of a public information brochure in Vietnamese and, as \nrequired, ethnic minority language(s) to the affected communities; (ii) placement of copies of the \nRP in Vietnamese and English in provincial, district, and commune offices; and (iii) uploading of \nthe RPs on the ADB resettlement website.  During loan implementation, the (i) RPs will be \nupdated for Phase 1 and (ii) RPs will be prepared for Phases 2 and 3 following detailed design.  \nAll RPs, prior to submission to ADB for review and approval, will include: (i) the distribution of a \npublic information brochure in Vietnamese and, as required, ethnic minority language(s) to the \naffected communities; and (ii) placement of copies of the RPs in Vietnamese and English in \nprovincial, district, and commune offices. All RPs submitted to ADB for review will be disclosed \non the ADB resettlement website before ADB approval.   \n \nI.  Complaints and Grievances \n13.  The Project will ensure that APs have clear and accessible mechanisms and procedures \nto address complaints and grievances about any aspect of land acquisition, compensation, and \nresettlement.  A  four-step  process  will  permit  APs  to  submit  grievances  to  the  Commune \nPeople\u2019s Committee (CPC) and, if not satisfied with the decision, appeal successively to the \nPeople\u2019s Committees at district and provincial levels and, finally, to the District People\u2019s Count.  \n \nJ.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n14.  The  Project  will  ensure  internal  and  external  monitoring  of  land  acquisition, \ncompensation and resettlement activities. PMU-1 is responsible for internal monitoring, in close \ncollaboration with PRC and RCs at lower levels. An independent monitoring agency will be \nretained to conduct external monitoring and evaluation, focusing on the social impacts of the \nProject  and  whether  APs  are  able  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  their  pre-project  living \nstandards,  incomes,  and  productive  capacity.  Sample  surveys  of  APs  will  be  carried  out \nbiannually  during  implementation  of  the  RP,  as  well  6\u201312  months  after  completion  of  all \nresettlement activities. \n \nK.  Budget \n15.  The budget for the RPs covers the cost of land acquisition, compensation payments, and \nallowances to APs, operational/administration expenses, internal and external monitoring, and \ncontingencies.   \n \n16.  PMU-1 will be responsible for channeling funds for the compensation for land acquisition \nand resettlement to the respective PPC. The PPC will be responsible for payment directly to \nAPs with respect to affected land, structures, crops and trees.  PMU-1 will also be responsible \nfor  contracting  an  NGO  or  other  independent  institution  to  conduct  external  monitoring  of \nimplementation of the RP. \n ", "  Appendix 7  43 \nTable A7.1 Entitlement Matrix \nType of Impact  Entitlement \n1.

Ethnic Minority Development Framework \n1.  The ethnic minority development framework (EMDF) was prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and Operations Manual Section F3, May 2004, and \npolicies and programs of the Government of Vietnam, and will guide the preparation of ethnic \nminority specific actions (EMSA) and ethnic minorities development plans (EMDP).  The overall \nobjectives of the EMDF are to ensure (i) that the project does not cause adverse social and \ncultural impacts; and (ii) that it provides the opportunity for ethnic minorities to reap project \nbenefits that are equal to, or greater than, the dominant cultural group by ensuring ethnic \nminorities participate fully in project planning and implementation.   \n \nB.  Preparation of Ethnic Minority Specific Actions  \n  and Ethnic Minority Development Plans \n2.  Screening  to  establish  basic  characteristics  and  issues of  ethnic  minorities  in each \ncommune within the zone of influence of the project roads is the first step in categorizing the \nimpacts  and  identifying  approaches  to  address  ethnic  minority  issues.  An  ethnic  minority \nspecific action (EMSA) is prepared if impacts on affected ethnic minorities are limited and when \nthere is a risk that the Project may not bring the intended benefits to the affected ethnic \nminorities. The EMSA may take the form of (i) incorporating ethnic minorities (who might be \nexcluded from the Project) into the project beneficiary group; (ii) incorporating ethnic minorities\u2019 \nspecific needs (that may not be addressed by the Project) into the project plan; and (iii) a \ncommon community action plan where ethnic minorities live with the non-ethnic minorities \npeoples in the same project location. The Project will avoid any unnecessary distinctions or \ninequalities between ethnic minorities and other poor and marginal groups who live in the same \nlocality.  \n \n3.  An ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) is prepared when the impacts on ethnic \nminorities are found to be significant and they positively or negatively (i) affect their customary \nrights of use and access to land and natural resources; (ii) change their socioeconomic status; \n(iii) affect their cultural and communal integrity; (iv) affect their health, education, and livelihood, \nand social security status; or (v) alter or undermine the recognition of indigenous knowledge.  \nThe  EMDP  is  an  integral  part  of  the  project  design  which  includes  provisions  for  project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The EMDP is time-bound, with an adequate budget \nfor its implementation. The EMDP is needed to ensure that ethnic minorities are included in the \ndevelopment  process.  The  EMDP  will  also  need  to  provide  specific  mechanisms  for  the \nconcerns of ethnic minority women to be identified and addressed through the subproject \nprocess.   Activities include: \n \n(i)  Conduct  of  social  and  cultural  analysis,  to  consist  of:  (a)  identification  of \nsignificant  negative  and  positive  impacts  on  the  ethnic  minorities; \n(b) identification of the measures required to mitigate the negative impacts; and \n(c) identification of the types and levels of vulnerability that might limit the ethnic \nminorities\u2019 ability to benefit from the project recommend measures, on a priority \nbasis, to enhance benefits. \n(ii)  Preparation of stand-alone EMDPs identifying the analysis and include specific \nstrategies and activities as a result of participatory community consultations and \nplanning.   \n(iii)  Coordination  with  CEMMA,  local  organizations  and  bilateral  agencies  or \ninternational  NGOs  working  on  poverty  reduction  programs  (e.g.,  agricultural ", "  Appendix 8  45 \nextension services) in the project area to allow possible integration of project \nactivities with existing social interventions.   \n(iv)  Disclosure  of  EMDPs  to  affected  communities  and  general  public  prior  to \nsubmission to ADB for review and approval. \n(v)  Submission to ADB for review and approval prior to implementation. \n(vi)  Disclosure of EMDPs on ADB indigenous peoples website immediately upon \nADB approval. \n \nC.  Ethnic Minorities in Phase 1 and 2 Road Networks \n4.  An initial social assessment was carried out during the project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA) for Phase 1 and 2 road networks.  Five of the nine networks that make up \nthe Phase 1 and 2 area have ethnic minority groups living on the subproject roads. In total, \nthere are approximately 54,816 people from ethnic minorities living in 27 communes within \nthese five networks along eight subproject roads.  These eight roads are in Ninh Thuan (roads \n1303, 1307, and 1310), Binh Thuan (road 1403), Dak Nong (road 1701), Dak Lak (roads 1702 \nand 1703) and Lam Dong (road 1801). Overall, people from ethnic minorities account for 6.2% \nof the population along network roads in Phases 1 and 2 but on roads on five of these networks, \npeople from ethnic minorities account for 11.4% of the population. However, some of the \ncommunes in these networks have very high percentages of ethnic minorities, most notably \nBinh Thuan, Dak Lak, and Lam Dong, where in four communes over 85% of the population is \nfrom ethnic minorities.  \n \n5.  The roads providing access for the ethnic minority communities have been in existence \nfor some time, although they are generally in poor condition, with some closed for periods of \ndays during the rainy season.  Consequently, none of the project communities or ethnic minority \ncommunities, fall within the definition of \u201cisolated\u201d within the Vietnamese context, where this \nterm is used to describe very remote mountain communities without road access. This is an \nimportant point in terms of the potential impacts on culture and traditions of the ethnic minority \ncommunities living in on eight of the subproject roads. Overall, ethnic minority communities \nalong the roads mostly live among Kinh people and are assimilated to varying degrees. The \nProject will have a range of social benefits mostly associated with improvements in standards of \nliving and enhancement of general well-being of households and communes.  However, there \nmay be some ethnic minority communities that are vulnerable and may face difficulties in \nabsorbing project benefits compared with the mainstream population due to poverty, language, \ncultural differences, low skill levels and, in some cases, limited contact with the mainstream \npopulation. The impacts on ethnic minorities are found to be limited.  The issue with the most \npotential for negative impacts is that of land acquisition and resettlement.  The general impacts \nand benefits on ethnic minorities are found in Table A8.1.  \n \nD.  Mitigation and Development Strategy \n6.  The following mitigation measures and development interventions arose from the results \nof community consultations.   \n \n(i)  Resettlement plans have been and will continue to be prepared to address the \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts.  Sociocultural conditions of the ethnic \nminorities have been and will be taken into account to ensure that they are aware \nof project impacts and benefits, their rights and entitlements as affected ethnic \nminorities, in a form and language and approach that they can understand. In \nPhase 1, the resettlement plan that has been prepared for Lam Dong province \nincludes specific actions on ethnic minorities. \n ", "46  Appendix 8 \n \nTable A8.1  General Impacts and Benefits \nImpact  Effect \nPositive Impacts \nDecrease in  The poverty impact analysis finds that the primary mechanism through which benefits will accrue \nTransportation  to the poor is savings in vehicle operating costs that will be passed on to the poor through lower \nCost.     freight rates, lower passenger fares, and time savings.  However, ethnic minorities may benefit to \na lower degree than other project beneficiaries because they use passenger transport or shipping \nservices less.  Many ethnic minority households do not produce enough agriculture produce to be \nable to sell meaningful quantities and those that do usually sell locally.  Ethnic minority households \nin more remote areas may benefit from an increase in the availability of goods and a decrease in \nprices because of a fall in transport costs. \nImproved  The ability to get goods to market will encourage farmers to produce more and higher value \naccess to  products and move out of subsistence farming.  Although some ethnic minority farmers produce \nMarkets and  cash crops and livestock products, many may need assistance to move beyond subsistence \nAgricultural  farming.  It may be more difficult for ethnic minorities to make investments in production and \nExtension  marketing (eliminating middlemen and be able to take greater advantage of market fluctuations) of \nhigher-valued and perishable products.  Improved access to agricultural extension services such \nas sustainable production techniques could assist ethnic minorities \nImpact on  Access to existing services at commune and district level will improve and ethnic minorities will \nService Delivery  benefit from easier and less costly access to these services.  As the project surveys found, local \nand Access  people, including ethnic minority people, are heavy road users. It is anticipated that all groups, \nethnic minority and mainstream populations will benefit from easier travel and improved year \nround access. \n \nImproved roads will also have a positive impact on the attendance of ethnic minority children in \nschools.  Social services in villages may also improve benefiting ethnic minority communities.  For \nexample, teachers and other social service providers may be more willing to work in the area after \ntransportation problems have been reduced and/or make more regular trips to the villages.  This \nimpact will be strongest on roads that were previously not opened all year round. \nEmployment  There is an expectation among ethnic minorities of employment during the construction stage.  \nDuring  However, this may not arise without explicit project intervention.  Often road building contractors \nConstruction  hire mainly through labor contractors, who may or may not hire from surrounding villages.  This \ncan result in only a few local people being hired and then only for short periods.  It is important \nthat ethnic minorities from local communities benefit as much as possible from increased earnings \nresulting  from  construction  employment  and  that  all  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor laws.  Provisions for these issues will be built into the monitoring program for the \nProject. \nNegative Impacts \nRelocation and  The  issue  with  the  most  significant  potential  for  negative  impact  is  land  acquisition  and \nResettlement  resettlement.  In Phase 1, about 30 people from ethnic minorities in Lam Dong Province will be \naffected by acquisition of agricultural land.  Five will be severely affected.  Specific actions have \nbeen included in the resettlement plan prepared for Lam Dong.  \nIncreased Road  Local residents are concerned about an increase in road accidents because of faster vehicle \nAccidents  speeds.  Concern was expressed by members of ethnic minorities, both women and men, about \nthe risk to their children traveling to school along the roads.  Roadside improvements will need to \ninclude proper signage for speed limits and passing areas. \nIncreased  It is not anticipated that truck traffic will increase in the short term.  The network layouts provide \nExposure to  little scope for the diversion or generation of traffic to the subproject roads.  The subproject roads \nCommunicable  mainly serve low-density rural communities and do not provide thoroughfares between major \nDiseases  highways  or  cross  border  connections.    Therefore,  the  risk  of  increasing  transmission  of \nHIV/AIDSa because of increased truck traffic appears to be low. \nIncreased in  Given the current condition of the roads, it is not anticipated that road improvements will lead to \nMigration   significant in-migration. However, although the impact of in-migration from distant provinces may \nbe small, the improved roads will probably draw people from the local area.  The amount of good \nland in the project area is finite and people moving closer to the road could put pressure on ethnic \ncommunities, as they may have less experience at dealing with outsiders and other ethnic minority \ngroups.  \na Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \nSource(s): Asian Development Bank Staff ", "  Appendix 8  47 \n(ii)  Road safety designs will be covered within the institutional capacity building and \ntraining needs component of the Project. \n(iii)  The  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STI)  awareness  and \nprevention program will be implemented under the Project and will target ethnic \nminorities.  \n(iv)  The sustainable agricultural production program has been identified during the \ninitial social assessment and community consultations as an intervention that can \nincrease the agricultural production of ethnic minorities.  The farmer field schools \nand  farmer  life  schools  activities  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  national  integrated  pest \nmanagement  (IPM)  program  offers  a  good  example  of  a  community-driven, \nsustainable livelihood approach to increasing community empowerment while \nincreasing agricultural production. The national IPM Program is already well-\nestablished, offers a nationwide body of trainers, and has a proven track record.   \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements \n7.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  with \nresponsibility for planning and implementation delegated to Project Management Unit No 1 \n(PMU-1) and the provincial departments of transport (PDOTs). A social development/ethnic \nminority development program coordinator will assist PMU-1 in the design and implementation \nof the EMSAs and EMDPs.  PMU-1 will ensure that a suitable NGO is engaged to implement \nEMDPs in accordance with ADB indigenous peoples policies, procedures and implementation \nrequirements. \n \nF.  Budget \n8.  A budget of $500,000 has been allocated from the overall project cost to provide funds \nfor the preparation and implementation of EMSAs and EMDP if these are required.  The design \nand implementation of EMSA and EMDP will be covered in the terms of reference for the civil \nworks and implementation services.  \n \nG.  Implementation Schedule \n9.  Detailed design, resettlement planning and implementation started in September 2005.  \nIt is anticipated that construction contracts will start being awarded in July 2006.  It is essential \nthat the EMSAs and EMDPs be prepared before the civil works begin so that potential negative \nimpacts can be identified and appropriate specific actions and mitigating measures put in place.  \n \nH.  Monitoring and Supervision \n10.  The design and implementation of EMSAs and EMDPs will be monitored regularly. A set \nof  monitoring  indicators  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation.    Monitoring  will \ninvolve staff from PMU-1, provincial project management units (PPMUs) and representatives \nfrom  ethnic  minorities,  communities,  and  organizations  to  ensure  participatory  monitoring \narrangements. PMU-1 will submit regular reports to ADB.  An external monitoring team will also \nbe engaged, if required.   \n \n ", " \nPROJECT DETAILED COST ESTIMATE AND FINANCING PLAN  4\n8\n($ million)   \n     \nItem  Foreign  Local   Total  ADB  NDF  Govt \nA\n      Exchange  Cost  Cost    FX  LC  Total    FX  LC  Total    LC  p\np\nA.

Introduction \n1.  The selection of networks for inclusion in the Project was based on long lists of proposed \nsubprojects (road sections) prepared by the concerned provincial governments. These lists \nwere  subsequently  scrutinized  by  the  consultant  to  ascertain  their  completeness  and \nconsistency, and to identify coherent networks that connect to major roads, thus ensuring that \nthe project area receives effective all-year connections to markets and services. The proposed \nnetworks were discussed in detail with representatives from the concerned provinces during a \nworkshop in Hanoi, on 27 November 2003, to arrive at an agreed-upon long list of networks. \n \n2.  The networks were then prioritized to assess the potential of individual networks to \ngenerate  economic  benefits  and  achieve  the  social  objectives  of  the  project.  The  criteria \nadopted were: (i) population served, (ii)  incidence of poverty in the zone of influence, (iii) traffic \nintensity, (iv) the general surface condition of the existing roads, and (v) the number of days of \nroad closure per year. The networks with the highest score in each province were included in \nPhase 1 and subjected to detailed cost--benefit analysis based on road inventory and classified \ntraffic counts for each project road. This produced the data needed for economic analysis by the \nHDM-4 model.1 Calibration of HDM-4 was applied to reflect local conditions, in particular vehicle \nspeeds and the effects of very high proportions of motorcycles in total traffic flow. \n \n3.  The economic evaluation compared the \u201cwith\u201d and the \u201cwithout\u201d project cases. The \nproject networks were evaluated for a period up to and including 2027, allowing for a 2-year \nconstruction period starting in 2006, followed by a benefit period of 20 years. The analysis was \nperformed using the world price numeraire. Current wage rates in the project area were found to \nreflect the marginal value of skilled labor whereas the marginal value of unskilled labor was \nabout 55% of the current minimum wage rate.2 A medium-term forecast for crude oil of $30 per \nbarrel  was  adopted  in  lieu  of  current  crude  prices,  to  avoid  the  impact  of  spurious  price \nvariations. The estimate is derived from data and analysis published in by the International \nEnergy Agency on its website in 2004. Except for oil products, all base prices are current as of \n2004. \n \n4.  Benefits  are  identified  by  assessing  (i) the  incremental  direct  user  benefits  due  to \nreduced vehicle operating costs (VOC) and passenger time savings, and (ii) the direct savings \nin road maintenance cost due to upgrading of road surfaces from earth or gravel to sealed \nstandards. Future maintenance costs in the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d cases were determined using \nHDM-4 to identify optimal maintenance. The capital cost associated with the project includes the \ncost  of  construction,  design,  supervision,  environmental  mitigation,  land  acquisition,  and \nresettlement. The residual value of the roads at the end of the evaluation period, estimated at \n25% of the cost of construction, was included. The assumed residual value of 25% reflects the \nfact that it is unusual for a road to be abandoned. More typically, the existing road will be \nincorporated into rehabilitation or upgrading work. The residual value assumed reflects the \nsavings in the cost of constructing the \u201crehabilitated\u201d or \u201cupgraded\u201d road by incorporating the \nremains of the existing road. \n \n                                                 \n1 The highway design and maintenance model version 4 (HDM-4) is the acknowledged reference tool for economic \nassessment of road projects. \n2 These results were obtained from the initial social analysis and concur with the findings of similar studies in Viet \nNam performed recently by the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. ", "  Appendix 13  53 \nB.  Forecast Traffic and Traffic Benefits \n5.  Normal traffic growth is forecasted by applying income-elasticities that link future traffic \ngrowth to forecast future economic growth. The forecast assumes that the Vietnamese economy \nwill continue to expand at approximately the same rate as in the previous 10 years, about 7.5% \nper  annum  on  average.  The  elasticity  adopted  is  based  on  those  estimated  in  the  Rural \nTransport Study,3 with some modifications reflecting trends in traffic growth rates in Viet Nam \nover the 10 years to 2003. The adopted growth rates are summarized in Table A13.1. \n \nTable A13.1: Forecast Annual Normal Traffic Growth Rates \nForecast Year  Motorcycle  Car  Bus  Truck \n2000\u20132005  13.5%  9.8%  9.0%  8.6% \n2006\u20132010  10.5%  8.4%  7.8%  8.1% \n2011\u20132027  8.5%  7.5%  7.5%  7.2% \nSource: ADB. 2002.

Generated traffic was included in the case of earth roads, where conditions during the \nrainy season significantly affect the flow of traffic. The potential for diverted traffic was not \nidentified in any of the networks and diverted traffic has therefore not been included. Based on \nthe traffic forecast and the improvements in road conditions, vehicle operating cost (VOC) \nsavings relative to the \u201cwithout\u201d case were calculated using the HDM-4 model. The savings in \nVOC costs in the \u201cwith\u201d case result from smoother road surfaces and higher speeds. The \nassociated  passenger  time  savings  were  based  on  estimated  economic  values  of  time, \nobserved average vehicle occupancy rates, and the calculated time savings resulting from \nhigher vehicle speeds. \n \nC.  Project Costs \n7.  The capital costs are estimated assuming upgrading or rehabilitation of the project roads \nto Class V or Class IV standard as indicated by predicted traffic and in all cases with a double \nbituminous surface treatment (DBST) pavement. Bridge repair costs have been included in the \ntotal  capital  cost  of  the  road  under  consideration.  Wherever  an  existing  bridge  has  been \nevaluated as unsafe, replacement costs have been applied. The total costs include allowances \nfor miscellaneous cost items, environmental mitigation measures, resettlement, design, and \nconstruction supervision. It was assumed that Phase I construction will take place during 2006\u2013\n2007. \n \n8.  The cost of road maintenance, encompassing routine and periodic maintenance, was \nincluded using HDM-4 estimation based on the adopted construction standards and forecast \ntraffic. In the case of upgrading of an unsealed road to sealed standard, future maintenance \ncosts  are  lower  than  in  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  case.  The  reduction  is  considered  a  benefit  in  the \nevaluation. Another benefit is the residual value of the roads at the end of the analytical horizon, \nestimated at 25% of construction cost. \n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n9.  The economic evaluation discounts the stream of benefits and costs over a 22-year \nevaluation period from start of construction in 2006 until 20 years after completion of the road \n                                                 \n3 DFID. 2000. Rural Transport Study. Hanoi. \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nrehabilitation works. The EIRRs for the road networks considered for Phase 1 implementation \nare in the range of 12.5%\u201343.6%.  Apart from these two extremes, three networks generate \nEIRRs of 14.4%\u201314.8% and four networks 20.0%\u201322.4%. The EIRR for Phase 1 in total is \n22.3%. Table A13.2 provides a summary of the net benefit streams. \n \n10.  The poor current condition of many of the roads means that high levels of benefits are \ngenerated when traffic levels are significant, or there are high levels of motorcycle traffic.  In \nsome cases the benefits would be expected to be higher than those shown, as there will be \nadditional benefits to those included in the evaluation.  This applies particularly to the Ha Tinh \nand Lam Dong networks.  In the case of Ha Tinh, a large number of bridgeworks are included in \nthe improvements, for which there will be benefits in the form of preventing future closure of \nroads or restrictions on vehicle weights.  The particularly high rate of return for the Nghe An \nnetwork largely reflects the benefits to a particular high level of truck traffic recorded in that \nprovince. \n \nTable A13.2: Summary of Net Benefits and Calculated NPV and EIRR \n \n1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9   \nYear  Nghe  Ha  Quang  Thua  Ninh  Binh  Dak  Dak  Lam  Total \nThien \nAn  Tinh  Tri  Thuan  Thuan  Nong  Lak  Dong  Project \nHue \n  ($\u2019000) \n2006  (3,693)  (3,009)  (1,833)  (2,066) (2,905) (2,494) (3,925.8) (1,115)  (1,853)  (22,895)\n2007  (3,693)  (2,989)  (1,824)  (2,067) (2,844) (2,494) (3,925.4) (1,115)  (1,853)  (22,804)\n2008  3,416  801  768  680 689 901 872.5 417  367  8,913\n2009  3,631  998  685  733 916 978 935.9 449  394  9,719\n2010  3,871  742  741  788 823 1,060 1,006.0 486  423  9,940\n2011  4,084  764  791  836 952 1,134 1,069.3 517  449  10,598\n2012  4,269  818  846  888 1,101 1,214 1,136.3 551  477  11,300\n2013  4,493  876  904  942 1,375 1,300 1,207.0 586  507  12,191\n2014  4,748  939  967  1,000 664 1,393 1,283.5 623  539  12,157\n2015  4,438  608  789  835 297 1,100 821.1 358  67  9,313\n2016  5,405  1,086  1,108  1,120 906 1,611 1,460.1 707  610  14,014\n2017  5,613  1,178  1,195  1,183 805 1,730 1,551.5 750  649  14,653\n2018  5,909  1,325  1,309  1,246 1,141 1,858 1,647.9 794  690  15,920\n2019  6,203  1,355  1,452  1,313 862 1,990 1,749.5 837  734  16,495\n2020  6,566  1,608  1,301  1,395 1,072 2,122 1,856.5 884  780  17,584\n2021  6,864  1,386  1,382  1,489 1,635 2,248 1,968.9 933  829  18,735\n2022  7,120  1,298  1,464  1,540 1,071 2,400 2,086.6 982  881  18,842\n2023  6,836  1,036  1,351  1,440 375 2,211 1,712.3 727  432  16,122\n2024  8,874  1,834  1,805  1,915 1,464 2,830 2,598.2 1,216  1,079  23,617\n2025  8,617  1,844  1,934  2,050 1,736 3,044 2,766.3 1,282  1,152  24,424\n2026  8,814  1,984  2,143  2,135 2,650 3,301 2,936.5 1,339  1,229  26,533\n2027  11,081  3,648  3,381  3,259 5,499 4,781 5,129.2 1,967  2,275  41,020\nNPVa 23,169  1,131  3,025  2,730 1,171 4,6312 1,447 1,920  144  39,369\nEIRR (%)  43.6  14.6  21.8  20.0 14.8 22.4 14.4 22.1  12.5  22.3\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.  \na NPV is based on discounting at 12% to the present value in 2006. \nSource: ADB. 2002.

Sensitivity Analysis \n11.  The impact of adjusting some of the key input values has been tested to show the \nsensitivity of the IRR to the changes. The IRR of each proposed project network was analyzed \nwith respect to changes in the benefit and cost streams. The tests applied were; (i) construction \ncosts increased and decreased by 20%, (ii) road user benefits increased and decreased by \n20%, (iii) traffic growth rates decreased by 2%, (iv) the value of time benefits decreased by \n100%, and (v) completion delayed by 1 year.  The results are shown in Table A13.3.  In the \ncase of the Lam Dong network the IRR falls below 12% with any change that increases costs or \nreduces benefits. The other three networks with a base case IRR below 15% remain viable in all \nsensitivity tests, although whenever a test reduces the IRR it reduces it to close to 12% . For \nthese networks, reducing traffic growth by 2% has the greatest impact of all the sensitivity tests. \nThe networks with IRRs of 20% or more in the base case, and the overall Project, remain clearly \nviable  in  all  cases,  even  with  significant increases  in  costs  or  reductions in benefits.  The \nswitching  values  for  the  overall  project,  which  are  the  values  that  render  the  project \neconomically infeasible, are estimated at a 98% increase in capital cost, a 52% decrease in \nvehicle  operating  cost  savings,  or  a  decrease  in  traffic  growth  by  7%.  Neither  reducing \npassenger time savings nor increasing delays in project benefits can reduce net benefits to the \npoint of infeasibility. \n \nTable A13.3: Sensitivity Analysis Results \nCapital Costs  VOC Savings  Traffic  Exclude  Delay \nBase \nNetwork  Growth  Pass.

The \nanalysis indicates that the poor receive about 46% of all project benefits.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \nADB's country strategy and program (CSP) for Viet Nam, approved in January 2002, emphasizes: (i) generating \neconomic growth, and (ii) a geographic focus on the central region. The Project is located in the central region and will \naddress economic growth by improving connectivity to rural areas with poor or seasonal access and increase the \nefficiency by which people can move and goods can be traded. Thus, this Project is consistent with the CSP.  \n \nProvincial roads form an important link between \"lower level\" infrastructure and \"upper level\" national networks. \nConnectivity is a key factor for enabling the poor to respond to market incentives and participate in economic growth. \nImproved transport infrastructure will contribute to a regionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating \nagricultural production and access to employment opportunities and facilitating access to social services. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project will improve approximately 945 kilometers (km) of roads in the central region. Roads to be upgraded will \nbe a combination of provincial and district roads selected using a network approach for each province.  The project \narea comprises the 19 provinces of the central region of Viet Nam. The project area includes the entire length of the \nflat, flood-prone coastal plain, gently rolling hills near the border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic in the \nnorth, and low mountains in the central highland provinces. The predominant economic activity in rural areas is \nagricultural production. Rice predominates in coastal plains, while coffee, tea, and sugar cane are abundant in hilly \nand low mountain areas. The principal mode for the movement of goods and people is by road transport. \nApproximately 50% of provincial roads in the central region are earth or gravel or penetration macadam roads rated in \nbad or poor condition, with many roads closed in the rainy season.  \n \nThe goal of the Project is to remove constraints on economic and social development in rural areas of the central \nregion of Viet Nam caused by inadequate transport infrastructure. The purpose of the Project is to induce more \nefficient, and cost-effective, movement of passengers and goods in rural areas of the central region. Outputs from the \nProject will include all-weather roads connecting selected rural areas and district and provincial centers built, road \nsafety programs implemented, and sustainable road and bridge asset management systems for provincial road \nnetworks established. \n \nThe incidence of poverty in the project provinces ranges from 16% to 53%, against a national average of 29%. The \npopulation served by the Phase 1 networks is approximately 908,000. The project road user survey found that overall \n47.3% of road users in the project area were poor (expenditures between D100,000 and D150,000/per person/month) \nand 16.3% were very poor (expenditures less than D100,000/per person/month) and that both poor and nonpoor were \nheavy road users. The large majority of people living in the project area depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Off-\nfarm employment opportunities are very limited. Local residents, mostly farmers, use the roads for transporting goods \nto market. Over 78% of local road users produced goods for sale, with 77% selling agricultural goods. Approximately \n46% of households selling goods cited high transport costs and unsatisfactory prices offered by middle marketers as \nthe reason for selling goods locally or at nearby markets.  \n \nThe Project's impact on poverty has been quantified by examining the share of total project net benefits that would \naccrue to the poor and to the very poor. The distributional analysis indicates that the project yields a poverty impact \nratio (PIR) of 0.46 and a poverty impact for the very poor of 0.15. The high poverty impact ratio reflects a high \nincidence of poverty among direct beneficiaries and a substantial net transfer of resources from the economy at large \nto the project area. Total net benefits accruing to the poor amount to approximately $18.1 million, of which the very \npoor receive approximately $6.0 million. With a Phase 1 network population of 908,000 and with 47.3% of road users \nbeing poor and 16.3% very poor, the project benefits will accrue to approximately 429,000 poor beneficiaries, of whom \nabout 148,000 are very poor. \n \nAlthough the project will greatly benefit the poor in the project area and is located in a geographical area that was \nidentified in the CSP as focus area for ADB intervention, it cannot be claimed to be specifically targeted since non-\npoor and poor alike have access to the road and will reap identical benefits. The Project is therefore classified as a \ngeneral intervention. \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nProject field surveys and participatory community consultation as well as a number of key informant interviews and \ninternational studies were used to inform the analysis. In total, 668 local residents, 46 passengers, and 158 vehicle \noperators living in the project area were surveyed.  \n \nThe communities along the project roads, including people from ethnic minorities, welcomed the opportunity to \nexpress their views and stated that they were willing to participate in project preparation and implementation. \nHowever, general knowledge and awareness of government programs and the Project is low. People had heard about \nroad improvement plans and had been promised an improved road for years, so were now discouraged. Overall, \npeople expressed the view that information needs to be widely publicized in a way that most people, particularly those \nfrom ethnic minorities people, would be able to access.  \n \nCommunes in the project area, including those containing people from ethnic minorities, showed unanimous support \nfor improving the roads. According to commune residents, the greatest benefits will be easier movement, increased \nincome sources, and new job opportunities. People also stated it would increase trips to hospitals, schools, and other \nsocial institutions.  Generally, people did expect a decline in transport costs that would benefit them directly through \nlower fares and freight rates.  The overarching benefit anticipated by the communities along the road was expressed \nas an improvement in their quality of life.  \n \nA participation strategy has been prepared for the resettlement plan, ethnic minority development framework, and the \nHIV/AIDS1 awareness and prevention program to ensure that the plans are culturally appropriate and implementable. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen accounted for 44.6% of total project survey respondents. Although the overall poverty rate for the project area \nwas 47.3%, 49.5% of women are poor. Similarly, although 16.3% of the population is very poor, 17.4% of women are \nvery poor. Hence, women as a separate group are poorer on average than the overall population in the project area. \nAbout 49% of women identified themselves as farmers and 28% as wage workers but almost all of this work is in \nagriculture. Approximately 33% of women had not completed primary school but this percentage is higher for women \nfrom ethnic minorities. Women mainly contribute to farming activities, frequently market small surplus production, and \nare usually responsible for fetching water and fuel-wood. Reduced travel costs, more available transport, and better \nroads will help improve the lives of women and children. Improved transport will result in increased access to basic \nsocial services (schools, health care facilities, and markets) and increased employment opportunities. It is anticipated \nthat greater road connectivity may have a direct and positive impact on the mostly illiterate girls and women from \nethnic minorities, by promoting their access to adult literacy and training opportunities.  In the project survey, women \nidentified easier movement as the primary benefit to arise from the improvements, followed by new job opportunities \nand increased source of incomes.  \n \nOther concerns are that the Project will increase the potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually-\ntransmitted infections (STIs) due to the influx of construction workers and increased communication as a result of the \nroad improvements. An additional risk related to increased roadway connectivity lies in the human trafficking of \nteenage girls and women. These risks will be minimized and mitigated through a gender, HIV and anti-trafficking \nprevention program, to raise awareness and provide preventive measures for local communities (with a special focus \non women from ethnic minorities), construction workers, and the mobile populations. \n \nWomen will benefit from the Project and a specific gender strategy has not been prepared.  Gender equity issues have \nbeen mainstreamed into the resettlement plan, ethnic minority development framework and the HIV/AIDS awareness \nand prevention program. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

An \nestimated 5,300 trees, 1,800 meters (m) of plant fences, \n53 ha of crops, and 630 m2 of fishpond will also be \naffected by the Project. \n    The  Project  will  reduce  transport  costs  for  the  poor   \n   Significant  through savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs).

This does not require a specific plan but the \nfollowing provisions will be built into relevant documents \nand will be monitored under the project\u2019s general \nmonitoring program. \n \nContracts will specifically refer to maximizing the use of \nlocal labor, require that legal wages be paid to workers, \nprohibit use of child labor for construction and \nmaintenance, and ensure there is differential between the \nwages paid to men and women for work of equal value. A \nspecific clause will be placed in bidding documents to \nnote that that compliance will be strictly monitored during \nproject implementation. \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \n    Five of the nine networks that make up the Phase 1 and 2   \n   Significant  areas have ethnic minority groups living in the communes   Yes \nIndigenous    along the roads.

Eight distinct ethnic minority groups have been \n None  identified along these project roads (Cham, Co ho, Dao, \nEde, Rag Lai, Tay, Thuong, and Hoa).  \n \nThe overall initial social assessment concluded that \nimpacts on ethnic minorities for Phase 1 and 2 road \nnetworks are limited and that the issue with the most \nsignificant potential for negative impacts is land \nacquisition and resettlement. The potential for exploitation \nof people from ethnic minorities is not high but may still \nincrease with more contact with mainstream populations \nbrought about due to road improvement. \n \nAn ethnic minority development framework (EMDF) has \nbeen  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1999)  and  Operations  Manual \nSection F3/BP, May 2004, and policies and programs of \nthe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  will  guide  the \npreparation of ethnic minority specific actions (EMSAs) \nand ethnic minorities development plans (EMDP). Hence, \nEMSAs have been incorporated in the RP specifically for \nLam  province.  For  Phase  3  road  networks,  the \npreparation of EMSA or stand-alone EMDPs will only be \nknown during loan implementation. The budget for the \ndevelopment of EMDPs has been estimated at $500,000. \n    Increased Exposure to Communicable Diseases   \nOther Risks   Significant  There is a risk of increasing the infection rate of HIV/AIDS   Yes \nand/or    during the construction stage.

However, there is a risk that their lack of \n None  awareness of HIV/AIDS may make people from ethnic \nminorities exceptionally vulnerable. Hence, project \nimplementation will include an HIV/AIDS awareness \nprogram and special measures will be taken to ensure \ninformation is delivered in a way that is accessible to \nethnic minorities. The cost of the HIV/AIDS awareness \ncampaign is estimated to be $500,000.  \n \nRoad Safety \nLocal residents were concerned about an increase in road \naccidents because of increased vehicle speeds.
