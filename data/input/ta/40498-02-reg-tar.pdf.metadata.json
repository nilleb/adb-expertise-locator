In July 2005, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched an energy efficiency initiative \n(EEI)  to  expand  its  operations  in  clean  energy1  to  $1  billion  a  year.  The  EEI  is  being \nimplemented in three phases. Phase I was completed in June 2006 with ADB Management\u2019s \nendorsement  of  a  draft  EEI  report  that  firmly  established  the  rationale  for  expanded  and \nsustained ADB action and clean energy investment, defined the general principles of the clean \nenergy investment and action plan, and provided priorities and a framework for next steps. \nDuring Clean Energy Week (20\u201322 June 2006), developing member country (DMC) officials and \ninternational experts also expressed their support for the EEI. Phase II aims to: (i) develop \ncountry and regional strategies and action plans on how to reach EEI targets, (ii) strengthen \nADB\u2019s institutional capacity so it can scale up, monitor, and evaluate activities under the EEI, \nand (iii) explore the possibility of establishing a Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \n(CEFPF).2 Clean energy investment opportunities will also be pursued during this phase. During \nphase III, the strategies and action plans will be implemented.  \n  \n2.  The concept paper for this regional technical assistance (RETA) project was approved \nby the Vice President, Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development on 27 July 20063 \nfor $2.9 million. However, only $600,000 was available in 2006. Therefore phase II of the EEI \nwas divided into two parts.  Part I, financed by the RETA4 for Supporting the Inception of EEI in \nDeveloping  Member  Countries,  was  approved  in  October  2006  for  $600,000  to  carry  out \npreliminary work. This involved (i) prioritizing DMCs for inclusion in EEI phase II activities, (ii) \nholding consultation workshops to identify the sectors with the highest clean energy investment \npotential in each DMC, (iii) preparing detailed work plans on how each country strategy would \nbe  developed,  (iv)  beginning  to  track  potential  clean  energy  investments  by  ADB,  and \n(iv) undertaking the initial design of the CEFPF. Part II will be financed by the current RETA, \nSupporting  the  Implementation  of  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  in  Developing  Member \nCountries, for $2.3 million. Most of this will be used by ADB\u2019s operations departments5 to \ndevelop detailed country action plans and a pipeline of ADB investments in clean energy \nprojects. The rest will be used to build ADB\u2019s internal capacity to implement clean energy \nprojects and to support the establishment of the CEFPF. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Energy use in DMCs is rapidly increasing to support the economic growth needed to \nraise the living standards of large populations, and is dominated by fossil fuels. The current \nenergy path, which focuses on expanding fossil fuel supplies, is neither environmentally nor \neconomically  sustainable.  Clean  energy  has  large  economic  and  environmental  benefits. \nIncreasing  energy  efficiency  wrings  more  service  value  from  each  primary  energy  unit \nconsumed. Promoting renewable energy and clean coal technologies will lead to more low-\ncarbon energy use. Clean energy is essential to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases, \n                                                 \n1  Clean energy is taken to cover energy efficiency (supply-side and end-use), renewable energy, and clean coal \ntechnology applications. \n2  CEFPF was formerly known as the Asia-Pacific Fund for Energy Efficiency (APFEE). \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 November 2006. \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Supporting the Inception of the Energy Efficiency Initiative in Developing \nMember Countries. Manila (TA 6346-REG). \n5  In the context of this RETA, ADB\u2019s operations departments refer to the Private Sector Operations Department and \nto the energy and infrastructure, transport, and urban development divisions of ADB\u2019s regional departments.  \n ", "2   \nease growth in fossil energy demand and upward pressure on energy prices, and improve \nenergy security.6\n \n4.  ADB is committed to increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy in its \nDMCs. ADB's energy policy, approved in October 1995,7 emphasized the need to accelerate \nthe use of clean energy in its DMCs. An energy policy review8 in 2000 stated that ADB would \nhelp its DMCs to formulate and implement viable clean energy projects, preferably with private \nsector involvement, to provide electricity in remote areas and improve the quality of life of the \nrural poor. ADB\u2019s energy policy is currently being reviewed with a view to placing even greater \npriority  on clean energy development.  \n \n5.  During  phase  I  (para.  1),9  the  EEI  working  group  identified  ADB\u2019s  strengths  and \nweaknesses. ADB\u2019s comparative advantage is derived from (i) its knowledge of the DMCs and \ntheir energy sectors, (ii) its existing and historic relationships with governments and prospective \nexecuting agencies, (iii) its ability to act regionally, (iv) its ability to innovate and introduce new \ninvestment instruments that can organize and facilitate the clean energy investment market, \n(v) its capacity to provide and mobilize public and private sector investments together and to \nstructure  public\u2013private  partnerships,  (vi)  its  ability  to  mobilize  funds,  (vii)  its  potential  for \ncombining  investment  with  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  capacity  building  programs,  and \n(viii) its financial strength as evidenced by its AAA rating. A successful clean energy investment \nprogram will require combining knowledge and skills in environment, energy, and finance. ADB \nis uniquely positioned in Asia to bring these three strengths together.  \n \n6.  The  EEI  phase  I  report  also  revealed  certain  ADB  weaknesses  and  barriers  to \nexpanding its clean energy investments (Table 1).  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  This RETA will help to decrease the rate of climate change and improve energy security \nin DMCs in the Asia and Pacific region through greater use of clean energy. The outcomes will \nbe (i) an expansion of ADB\u2019s clean energy program, (ii) greater capacity to develop clean \nenergy  projects  in  ADB\u2019s  operations  departments,  and  (iii)  new  and  innovative  financing \ninstruments  for  clean  energy  investments.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n \n                                                 \n6  A detailed analysis of the main issues related to clean energy is provided in Technical Assistance for Supporting \nthe Inception of the Energy Efficiency Initiative in Developing Member Countries (footnote 3).   \n7  ADB. 1995.

Activities  will  include  (a) \nestablishing  a  baseline  for  ADB\u2019s  clean  energy  investments    based  on  an \nongoing review of loan projects approved during the years 2004 to 2006, (b) \ndesign of a system for identifying projects with clean energy potential in non-\nenergy divisions, (c) design of a system to support development of clean energy \nprojects  in  non-energy  divisions,  and  (d)  establishment  of  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation system for clean energy projects.   \n(iii)  Support for developing clean energy projects in non-energy divisions through  \nparticipation by staff from ADB\u2019s Energy, Transport, and Water Division (RSID) of \nthe  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  in  project  design, \nconsultation missions, and recruitment of consultants with specific knowledge \nand  experience  of  the  technologies,  methodologies,  and  approaches  being \ndeveloped. \n \n10.  Component 2 will finalize the detailed design of the CEFPF, which will finance (i) small \nenergy  efficiency  investments  that  require  quick  and  efficient  transactions;  (ii)  technology \ntransfer for a small number of large high-impact interventions that will catalyze adoption of pre-\ncommercial  clean  energy  technologies;  and  (iii)  grant  assistance  for  institutional  capacity \nbuilding of financial institutions, facilitating project transactions, project preparation, developing \nmarket based incentives, and establishment of a monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Key \nactivities of the CEFPF design work will include:  \n \n(i)  consulting with key financial institutions in DMCs to (a) introduce the AFPEE, \n(b) discuss potential demand and how the AFPEE can be structured to meet \nsuch demand, and (c) accommodate other interests and concerns; \n(ii)  consulting  with  funding  agencies  to  determine  their  level  of  support  for  the \nCEFPF and the governance and reporting structure they would endorse; \n(iii)  collaborating with other ADB departments to ensure the optimal design of the \nFund\u2019s operational structure and developing detailed operational guidelines and \nproject criteria for the CEFPF, including criteria for the selection of intermediary \nfinancial institutions and the eligibility of subprojects; \n(iv)  developing  templates  for  framework  agreements  for  intermediary  financial \ninstitutions,  and  negotiating  and  signing  specific  agreements  with  financial \ninstitutions interested in participating in the CEFPF; and \n(v)  recruiting a management team and support staff for the CEFPF. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nirrigation) and through energy efficiency standards and labeling (for equipment, lighting, and domestic appliances); \n(iv) energy efficiency in the transportation sector (e.g., bio-fuel use, urban mass transit, and newer vehicle \ntechnologies); and (v) proposed power generation projects involving clean coal technologies. Projects with strong \npotential for clean development mechanism support will be passed on to the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund instead. \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2.3 million and it will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  RETA.  RSID  will  oversee  the  overall \nadministration  of  the  RETA.  All  activities  related  to  country  action  plans,  including  the \nidentification of a pipeline of projects for possible ADB financing, will be led by operations \ndepartments. For example, the operations departments and RSID will collaborate in drawing up \na work plan for each country and estimating the resources and consulting services needed to \nundertake  the  work  plan.  The  operations  departments  will  then  oversee  consultants\u2019 \nperformance and technical outputs. RSID will play a supportive administrative role, including \nadministering the contracts of the consultants and compiling the outputs of the various contracts \ninto  a  cohesive  set  of  country  strategies  and  action  plans.  This  is  a  continuation  of  the \narrangements under part I. To date, the DMCs that have been prioritized by the operations \ndepartments  are  Bangladesh,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India,  Indonesia,  Pakistan,  the \nPhilippines, and Viet Nam. Local counterparts will vary according to the country, sector, and \nwhether the projects are public or private. Activities funded by this RETA may only begin when \nADB has received written confirmation from the government that it has no objection to the \ninclusion of the country in the RETA. \n \n13.  RSID will take the lead in (i) establishing a baseline for ADB\u2019s clean energy operations  \nfrom a review of loans approved  through the period 2004 to 2006, (ii) developing systems for \nidentifying and tracking potential clean energy investments in projects, (iii) supporting non-\nenergy divisions to implement clean energy projects, (iv) developing a model clean energy \nproject design, (v) establishing a monitoring and evaluation system, and (vi) supporting non-\nenergy divisions to develop clean energy components in their projects.  RSID will work closely \nwith the EEI task force and operations departments in carrying out these activities. It will also \ntake the lead in developing CEFPF and will work in close coordination with ADB\u2019s operations \ndepartments, Controller\u2019s Department, Treasury Department, Office of the General Counsel, \nOffice of Cofinancing Operations, and other offices.  \n \n14  The RETA will begin in April 2007. It will be carried out over a 24-month period and will \nbe completed by April 2009. It will require an estimated 42 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 144 person-months of national consulting services. The engagement of \nconsultants will be phased according to the sequence of activities. The international consultants \nwill be expected to spend most of their time in the field.  Detailed terms of reference will be \ndrafted by RSID in consultation with the operations departments for each work component. It is \nexpected that most international consultants will be recruited as individuals because of the need \nto source specialized, including country-specific, expertise.  However, it is expected that a firm \nwill be recruited on the basis of bio-data proposals for the country action plans. The recruitment \nof  consultants  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2006, as amended from time to time).
