THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Government of Fiji (the Government) has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide support by lending for the proposed Nadi Flood Alleviation Project. Located at \nthe confluence of three rivers, Nadi Township (Nadi) is subjected to frequent flooding with \nconsequent damages to urban infrastructure, and social and economic disruption and loss of life. \nThe project impact will be: economic and social losses and loss of life from flood events reduced; \nwater policy planning and sustainable resource management practices strengthened; and long \nterm sustainability in the provision of freshwater resources and catchment security ensured. The \noutcome is: reduced damages from flooding events in Nadi River catchment. The project outputs \nwill be (i) structural project outputs which may include: river training, dredging and widening, the \nprovision of dikes and automated retarding basins, and the replacement of bridges; (ii) non-\nstructural outputs which will include the provision of a hydrometeorological system, flood hazard \nmapping, and the establishment of disaster response management systems; and (iii)  institutional \ncapacity development which will introduce policy and regulations; and develop capacity in the \nMinistry of Waterways and Environment (MOWE). The Country Operations Business Plan (COBP) \n2019-2021 listed a $2 million TRTA grant in 2019 that will lead into a Project Readiness Facility \n(PRF) to fund detailed design in 2019 standby and 2020 firm, followed by an indicative $150 \nmillion ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan in late 2020. JICA will parallel grant finance \n($20million) of drainage improvements within Nadi, while the ADB-financed OCR loan will finance \ncatchment wide modifications (primarily river training, dikes and retarding basins), and implement \nthe institutional and regulatory reforms necessary to achieve sustainability. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Responding to Government request for assistance, in mid\u20132014 JICA commenced a \ncomprehensive two-year feasibility study on flood management for the Nadi River catchment. The \nstudy acknowledged the urgent need to establish a holistic flood management master plan. In \nAugust 2016 JICA published a feasibility study (FS) that proposed a master plan involving a range \nof structural and non-structural flood control measures over a 30-year period.1 The master plan \nidentified a \"Priority Project\" which included various structural measures to immediately mitigate \nflood damage in priority areas in the Nadi area.2  \n \n3.  This TA will complement the ensuing loan by building on, exploring and assessing \nvariations of the structural measures proposed in the 2016 Feasibility Study.3 The TA will consider \nmodified scenarios of population growth and take into consideration changes in land-use and \nclimate change. A range of flood protection levels will be considered to identify an economically \noptimal investment.4 With an overall design approach geared toward improving climate resilience, \nconsideration will be given to different levels of flood protection and maximizing the efficiency of \nthe retarding basins flood alleviation capacity. A particular focus will be given to nature-based \n \n1 Yachiyo Engineering Co., Ltd. and CTI Engineering International Co., Ltd. September 2016. The Project for the \nPlanning of the Nadi River Flood Control Structures in the Republic of Fiji.  \n2 The Priority Project was proposed to involve middle stream river widening and dredging, a tributary river shortcut to \nalleviate backwater effects, and sluiced retarding basins. It will also involve reconstruction of two bridges, bank \nprotection, new river structures, surrounding levees and a ring dike (or polder). \n3 This Technical Assistance first appeared in the ADB business opportunities website in February 2019 \n4 The ADB Guidelines on the Economic Analysis of Projects identifies that for \u201cprojects that generate environmental \nbenefits (such as pollution control, protection of the ecosystem, flood control, and control of deforestation), the \nminimum required EIRR can be lowered to 6%.\u201d \n ", "2   \nsolutions, and options to introduce adaptability (to climate change outcomes) to improve utility \nand resilience, to counter the projected increases in rainfall intensity. Consistent with the National \nDevelopment Plan5 focus on strengthening water policy planning and sustainable resource \nmanagement, the TA will importantly support a robust stakeholder consultation process, and \npromote  ongoing  discussion  on  the  development  of  enabling  institutional  and  regulatory \nframeworks. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Output 1: Flood alleviation design approach agreed. A consulting firm will update the \nfeasibility study by testing modifications to the flood alleviation structural measures recommended \nin the feasibility study. A multi criteria analysis will be used to identify the most economically \noptimal investment by considering a range of flood protection levels depending on the value of \nthe economic and social assets in a given area. Recommendations will be disseminated in two \nstakeholder workshops, with government direction and agreement sought on the physical extent \nof the flood alleviation structural interventions anticipated under the project. A collection of \nindividual consultants, in collaboration with the consultant updating the feasibility study, will \ncomplete  all  safeguards,  economic,  financial  and  procurement  due  diligence  necessary  to \nproceed to loan approval. \n \n5.  Output 2: Scope of project non-structural interventions agreed. A gap analysis on the \nexisting hydrometeorological system data collection, monitoring and management system will \nassist in the specification of complementary automated hydrometeorological stations, and stream \ngauging stations, and enhanced resourcing to enable the development of improved flood warning, \ndisaster response and flood management systems.6 Recognizing the considerable opportunity to \nreduce both exposure and vulnerability to floods through risk informed land use planning, flood \nhazard mapping and flood risk mapping will inform a wider urban planning strategy discussion \nand the establishment of land use regulations. This output will involve completion of all safeguards, \neconomics  and  procurement  analysis  due  diligence  sufficient  for  presentation  of  a  Project \nReadiness Facility for ADB approval.  \n \n6.  Output 3: Scope of the institutional development plan agreed. The TA will develop \nplans  to  undertake  a  comprehensive  water  sector  assessment  to  support  the  National \nDevelopment  Plan  objective  to  \u201cformulate  and  implement  a  National  Water  Resource \nManagement and Sanitation Policy to govern the planning and development of water resources\u201d \n(NDP, page 19). Plans will be formulated to establish an integrated flood risk management plan \n(FRMP) and mainstream it into the policy, planning and legislation framework. Effort will focus on \ndefining a clear MOWE mandate and the resourcing and capacity needed to meet its responsibility \nfor integrated water resource management (IWRM), sector coordination and risk planning and \nmanagement. The Nadi Basin Coordination Committee will be re-established to support and direct \ndiscussions on the design of all project outputs7. To ensure the long-term sustainability of the built \nassets, appropriate institutional frameworks with supporting funding sources will be examined.

The NBCC was endorsed by the cabinet in 2011. The Pacific IWRM Project was \ncompleted in 2013 and the NBCC was disbanded in 2014 when funding expired, without a clear pathway for future.  \n ", "3 \n \nTRTA deliverables must maximize the potential for counterpart staff to benefit from the learning \nopportunities that will arise from the stakeholder consultations and project design process.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.015 million, of which $2 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) to be administered by ADB.8 The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n8.  Under  JFPR  funding  eligible  expenditures  include:  (i)  consultant  services,  (ii)  non-\nconsultant costs for local training and workshops, (iii) minimal office equipment, and operating \ncosts essential to carry out the technical assistance, including vehicle rental if justified. Non-\nconsultant costs should be kept to a minimum. Ineligible expenditures include: (i) purchase of \nvehicles,  (ii)  salaries  for  civil  servants,  (iii)  scholarships  or  long  internships,  (iv)  detailed \nengineering design, (v) civil works and other related expenses, and (vi) those under ADB\u2019s List of \nIneligible Items (or Negative List) and prohibited Investment Activities List.9 \n \n9.
