INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strengthening decentralization policy and enhancing regional governments\u2019 ability1 to \ndeliver services are core elements of the Government of Indonesia\u2019s five-year development plan. \nThese objectives also represent a key pillar of the country operations business plan, 2009\u20132011, \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 This policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) falls \nunder the long-standing Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program and \nprovides support to actions in the policy matrix for subprogram 2, which was approved by the \nBoard  in  December  2008.  The  TA  builds  on  several  earlier  TA  projects  under  the  Local \nGovernment Finance and Governance Reform Program and was anticipated in the report and \nrecommendation of the President.3 A fact-finding mission for the TA was fielded from 5\u201314 \nAugust  2009,  and  agreement  was  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  purpose,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and financing of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.4 \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since  1999,  the  Government  has  pursued  major  decentralization  reforms  through \ndevolution  of  authority,  functional  assignments,  and  funding  to  regional  governments.  An \nestimated 40% of all public expenditures in Indonesia are now managed directly by regional \ngovernments. With ADB support, the Government has developed a medium-term, sectorwide \napproach for managing fiscal decentralization reform, known as the National Action Plan for \nFiscal Decentralization, 2005\u20132009, and the soon-to-be issued longer-term strategic framework \nknown as the Grand Strategy for Fiscal Decentralization. Various ADB loans (footnote 3) have \nbeen  approved  since  2005  to  support  decentralization  efforts,  which  have  also  been \naccompanied by TA projects.  \n \n3.  The first program loan, covering 2003\u20132005, was prepared and implemented with two \nTA projects.5 The Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program 1 focused on \nlegal, regulatory, and policy reforms and helped entrench those made since 1999. The expected \noutcome was to increase accountability in the management of regional government finances by \nstrengthening the policy framework for decentralization. A single tranche program loan of $300 \nmillion was disbursed in late 2005 based on achievement of agreed actions over the period \n2003\u20132005.  A  related  project  loan  of  $30  million\u2014mainly  to  support  computerization  and \ncapacity development investments in regional governments\u2014was also approved in late 2005 \nand is still being implemented.  \n \n4.  The  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Program  2,  covering                \n                                                                  \n1  The term \u201cregional government\u201d is used in this report to encompass both provincial and local governments.

Subprogram 1, which covered 2006\u20132008 \nled to the drawing down of a $350 million program loan in late 2008 based on achievement of \nagreed actions over this period.7 The regulatory framework, including lower-level instruments, \nhas  almost  been  finalized,  policy  reform  has  been  enhanced  to  remove  distortions  and \nanomalies, and central government institutions have been strengthened and are planning for \nregional capacity building. Subprogram 2 envisages a drawdown of similar magnitude in 2011 \nbased on attainment of agreed actions set out in a policy matrix for 2009 to 2011. It is moving to \na more mature stage of a regulatory regime following the implementation of reforms to remove \nidentified policy bottlenecks while conducting central government institutional strengthening and \nregional government capacity building. Appendix 4 shows the policy matrix triggers. \n \n5.   When the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program 2 was approved \nin  2008,  the  Board  also  approved  an  associated  TA  of  $1.5  million,  which  would  begin \nimplementation in 2009.8 The RRP also foreshadowed this TA of $1 million to support the \nGovernment in meeting actions in the subprogram 2 policy matrix through policy advice and \ncapacity building. The policy matrix identifies the main areas for capacity building support and \nlinks the two TAs. The associated TA addresses policy related to a decentralization framework, \nintergovernmental  fiscal  system,  own-source  revenues,  and  capacity  development  with  the \nfollowing outputs: (i) develop the National Action Plan for Fiscal Decentralization, 2010\u20132014; (ii) \ncreate forward estimates for intergovernmental financing; (iii) improve design and monitoring of \nspecial allocation funds (DAKs); (iv) improve implementation of incentive- and sanction-linked \ntransfers; (v) develop policy on the devolution of property tax; and (vi) conduct decentralized \ncapacity  building  in  public  financial  management.  In  addition  to  the  general  monitoring  of \nattaining policy actions, the TA addresses the policy areas of the decentralization framework, \nregional autonomy, and capacity development with specific outputs detailed in the following \nsection. Appendix 5 maps the capacity-building areas of the two TAs to the Local Government \nFinance and Governance Reform Program 2.      \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA will be more efficient, effective, and equitable spending by regional \ngovernments. The expected outcome is strengthened capacity to attain all agreed actions under \nthe subprogram 2 policy matrix as well as to adopt new policies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will be implemented with intermittent inputs over 18 months, commencing in \nApril 2010. Although the policy matrix was already agreed to in 2008, additional support will be \nneeded to take account of newly emerging needs and priorities of the Government, some of \nwhich may not become apparent until 2010 or 2011.  \n                                                                  \n6  ADB. 2007.

First, the team leader and deputy team \nleader will work on all actions in the policy matrix, including those that are not being directly \nsupported by activity components of either the associated TA or this TA and in relation to newly \nemerging priorities. Second, in line with the Government\u2019s wishes, a significant allocation has \nalso  been  made  for  training,  studies,  seminars,  and  conferences.  Several  workshops,  to \nbrainstorm findings and come to a consensus on the way forward, have been planned for each \ncomponent. The five key components or outputs are as follows. \n \n(i)    Provide monitoring, coordination, and support to attain all required actions \nunder the subprogram 2 policy matrix. An overview role in relation to the \npolicy matrix will be assigned to the team leader and deputy team leader. The \nmain  outputs  will  be  preparing  and  operationalizing  a  matrix  monitoring  and \nreporting system, and providing support to the Government for attaining key \nactions. \n \n(ii)  Strengthen  approaches  to  coordinate  fiscal  decentralization  policies. \nRevisions to Law No. 32/2004,9 which the Government will consider in early 2010, \nwill  chart  a  new  role  for  the  Regional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council  (DPOD), \nincluding more independence from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA).10 This \ncomponent will support the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) \nin  coordinating  all  stakeholders  on  the  development  of  new  DPOD  working \narrangements. Particular attention will be paid to the future role of the existing \nworking group on fiscal decentralization. The main outputs will be policy and \nadvisory  papers  on  (a)  Law  No.  32/2004  reforms,  (b)  new  organizational \nmanagement arrangements for DPOD, and (c) assessment of DPOD system and \nhuman capacity with proposals for strengthening.       \n \n(iii)  Reduce  inconsistencies  between  sector  and  decentralization  laws  and \nrelated  inconsistencies  in  budgets.  This component will review such legal \ninconsistencies in two selected ministries\u2014to be confirmed by the Government \nduring  inception\u2014as  well  as  budget  inconsistencies  that  may  occur  in  the \nMinistry  of  Education  (to  be  confirmed).  Advice  will  also  be  provided  on \nsystemwide approaches to resolving legal and budget inconsistencies linked to \nproposed changes to Law No. 32/2004. The main outputs will be (a) a policy \npaper  advising  on  Law  No.  32/2004  changes,  (b)  a  paper  mapping  legal \ninconsistencies for the two ministries, (c) draft national standards and physical \nnorms for the two ministries defining assignments of functions between various \ngovernment levels, (d) a policy paper on broad solutions to clarifying expenditure \nassignments,  and  (e)  an  analytical  paper  and  recommendations  regarding \ndeconcentration expenditures in the Ministry of Education budget. \n \n(iv)  Support further refinement and development of the regional government \nperformance measurement system. This component will support ongoing work \nin  software  development,  implementation  kits,  and  training  in  40  regional \ngovernments  in  10  provinces  in  regard  to  regional  government  performance \nmonitoring. It will refine the evaluation criteria and the number of indicators, as \n                                                                  \n9  Law  32/2004  addresses  regional  administration  including  formation  and  merger  of  regional  governments, \nassignment of expenditures, responsibilities of officials, the political structure and the civil service structure.  \n10 DPOD is currently based in MOHA and is the President\u2019s key external advisory body on decentralization policy \nmatters.  \n ", "4   \nsome items required by the government regulations may not be readily available \nin the regional governments. There is also a need to reconcile requirements of \nthe three related\u2014and, to some extent, overlapping\u2014evaluation systems now \noperating in MOHA. It will also develop systems for processing data received at \nregional  government  levels  and  also  for  the  training  of  regional  government \ntrainers. The main outputs will be (a) a paper reviewing the evaluation systems, \n(b)  a  paper  recommending  streamlining  of  indicators,  (c)  a  paper  reviewing \ncapacities  for  storing  and  analyzing  data,  (d)  policies  for  dissemination  of \nperformance data, and (e) practical support to train trainers.  \n \n(v)    Support improved efficiency in the transmission, collation, and analysis of \nfinancial  information  from  regional  governments.  This  component  will \nsupport the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in speeding up the transmission and \ncollation  of  regional  government  financial  management  information,  including \nreviewing  key  vendors  of  a  computerized  financial  management  information \nsystem  to  develop  simple  applications  for  soft-copy  submission  of  regional \ngovernment  data,  and  creating  simpler  options  for  regional  governments  to \nsubmit selected template information in soft-copy form rather than hard copies. \nThe component will also assist in training regarding data analysis and report \npresentation on regional government financial performance to be made available \non the MOF website and in special publications. It will also improve analytical \nsections of annual budget notes and the MOF annual report. The main outputs \nwill  be  (a)  templates  for  soft-copy  data,  (b)  consultations  with  financial \nmanagement information system vendors, (c) dissemination of information to \nregional governments on the use of templates, (d) staff and system assessments \nof  a  regional  financial  management  information  system  (SIKD),  and  (e) \nimplementing staff training and development initiatives to impact the quality of \nanalytical work. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,300,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide \n$1,000,000, financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan. The ADB financing will cover consulting services, report production, and miscellaneous \nadministrative  and  workshop  costs.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $300,000 \nequivalent to cover mainly in-kind office accommodation and support services. Detailed cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  MOF, Directorate General of Fiscal Balance, will be the Executing Agency for the TA, \nthrough  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  to  the  Directorate  General.  Regional  government \nrepresentatives, appointed under the closely-related associated TA, will ensure quality and \nprovide advice as needed. The implementing agencies will be the Directorate of Regional \nAutonomy,  BAPPENAS; Directorate of Regional Financial Information, MOF;  Directorate of \nRegional Autonomy Facilitation, MOHA; and Directorate of Regional Capacity Development and \nPerformance Evaluation, MOHA.  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  engage  15  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  54  person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants  with  skills  in  developing  capacity  in  a  broad  range  of \ndecentralization  areas  including  policy,  intergovernmental  financial  arrangements,  policy \n ", "      5\ncoordination,  consistency  of  decentralization  and  sector  laws,  deconcentration  funding, \nperformance monitoring systems, and collation and analysis of financial statistics. The outline \nterms of reference are set out in Appendix 3. Consultants will be engaged through a mix of firm \nand individual recruiting. The team leader and all national consultants will be recruited through a \nfirm. Two short-term international consultants will be recruited by ADB as individuals for 4 \nperson-months each. Consultants will be selected using a quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (80:20) with full technical proposals, and will be engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use Of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All assets will be \nprocured and disposed by the consultants in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.11  \n \n12.   The TA is expected to be implemented over an 18-month period, commencing in April \n2010 and completed in October 2011. The outputs will be disseminated mainly in the form of \nstudy and policy reports and policy-related seminars and workshops. The team leader will assist \nADB in providing quality control and outcome evaluation. In consultation with the Government, \nsome policy reports may be published for dissemination to a wider audience, including national \nand regional policy makers, academia, and development partners. \n \n13.  The  Directorate  General  of  Fiscal  Balance,  MOF  has  agreed  to  identify  adequate \nfurnished office accommodation for the TA team, including telephone and fax lines and internet \nconnection facilities. In total, the TA will employ eight persons (three short-term international \nand five longer-term national consultants). All consultants will work intermittently, and may \nspend considerable time at BAPPENAS, MOF, and MOHA. Accordingly, it was agreed that \noffice accommodation and furniture in MOF will be adequate for five persons, while BAPPENAS \nand MOHA will provide adequate desk space for consultants working from there intermittently.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia  for  Support  for  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance \nReform 2, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                                  \n11 ADB. 2008.
