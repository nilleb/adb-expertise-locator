The transfer of assets is expected to be\ncomplemented by the establishment of water user associations\n(WUAs),  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure,  and  enhancement  of\nextension  capacity.  A  sector  approach  is  proposed  to  be\nadopted. Prospective subprojects will be located in 17 districts in\nsix  provinces  identified  on  the  basis  of  specific  criteria.  A\ndetailed  feasibility  study  has  been  completed  for  two  core\nsubprojects in Nakhong and Chom Thong, in consultation with\nstakeholders,  and  the  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the\nrehabilitation  program  established.  The  Project  will  provide\nWUAs  with  support  for  developing  their  capacity  in  financial\nmanagement and market development. WUAs are expected to\nimplement proposed cost recovery measures. Rehabilitation of\nirrigation systems will include repairs to the pump sets, and\nreview  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  present  design  of  the\nheadworks and distribution systems. Extension support will be\nthrough provision of specialist services for technology transfer\nand  training  of  local  officials.  Extension  capacity  will  be\nenhanced by provision of training, training materials, and field\nstudy tours for farmers and select officials to familiarize them\nwith suggested best practices.\nClassification Primary     -   Economic growth\nSecondary -  Poverty reduction\nEnvironmental\nAssessment Category  -   B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) of core subprojects\nwas  undertaken  and  the  summary  IEE  is  available  as  a\nsupplementary appendix.\nRationale Most of the irrigation systems in the lowlands along the Mekong\nRiver are pump irrigation schemes. Many have existed for over\nfive years, but have been poorly maintained and hence do not\nfunction  efficiently.  Irrigation  system  rehabilitation  will  allow\nimprovements  in  water  management.  Because  of  budget\nconstraints,  the  Government  allocation  for  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) is insufficient; hence, there is no systematic\nprogram for undertaking O&M. Present water user groups do\nnot  have  sufficient  technical  and  extension  support.  WUAs\nshould  be  established  within  a  proper  legal  framework  and\nfunctionaries need to be trained in administrative, financial, and\ntechnical matters. Simultaneously, extension service support is\nneeded to ensure adoption of appropriate cropping patterns and\nbetter agronomic practices. Without extension services, it will be\ndifficult for beneficiaries to realize higher incomes. This failure", "iii\nwill  affect  their  capacity  and  willingness  to  meet  O&M  and\nreplacement costs.\nGovernment support for irrigation has been refined based on the\nrecent  agricultural  sector  strategy,  and  a  new  strategic\ndevelopment plan has been adopted. The Government strategy\nis  to  transfer  irrigation  assets  to  beneficiaries  and  place\nemphasis on rehabilitation. A nationwide irrigation management\ntransfer (IMT) program has been prepared to implement this\napproach. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) was\nreorganized  and  is  now  better  coordinated  at  central  and\nprovincial levels. The Department of Irrigation (DOI) has the\ninstitutional  capacity  to  implement  the  program  and  is\nimplementing ongoing ADB-financed projects satisfactorily. ADB\nassistance,  through  a  sector  approach,  will  enable  the\nGovernment to implement the IMT program in six provinces that\nhave a large concentration of pump irrigation systems.\nObjectives\nand Scope The  overall  goal  is  to  encourage  economic  growth  through\nimproved efficiency in agriculture, which is expected to reduce\npoverty  and  improve  food  security.  The  objectives  are  to\nestablish  sustainable  irrigated  agriculture  through  the  IMT\nprocess,  and  strengthen  WUAs  and  agricultural  extension.\nProject  objectives,  through  a  sector-type  project,  are  to  be\nachieved by (i) assisting irrigators to organize themselves into\nWUAs;  (ii)  rehabilitating  existing  irrigation  systems,  in\ncooperation  with  WUAs;  (iii)  providing  appropriate  extension\nservices to farmers to help them make rational decisions; (iv)\nenhancing  extension  capacity,  especially  at  provincial  and\ndistrict levels to support and sustain farmer-managed irrigation;\nand (v) providing institution building support to WUAs.\nCost Estimates The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $24.2  million\nequivalent,  comprising  about  $19.0  million  (78.5  percent)  in\nforeign exchange cost and $5.2 million (21.5 percent) equivalent\nin local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nSource      Foreign          Local          Total\n    Exchange      Currency      Cost     Percent\nADB 14.7 0.8 15.5        64\nAFD 2.6 0.1 2.7        11\nGovernment 0.7 1.3 2.0          8\nBeneficiaries 1.0 3.0 4.0        17\nTotal 19.0 5.2 24.2      100\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de\nDeveloppement.", "iv\nLoan Amount\nand Terms It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a\nloan  equivalent  to  SDR11,942,000  from  its  Special  Funds\nresources, with a repayment period of 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0 percent\nper annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2007\nImplementation The Executing Agency for the Project will be MAF, and DOI will\nArrangements be the Implementing Agency. The Office of the National Project\nDirector (ONPD) will have full authority to execute the Project,\nbut actual implementation will be decentralized to provinces to\nprovide  technical  support  and  districts  to  undertake  physical\nimplementation. The Survey, Study, and Design Center (SSDC)\nwithin DOI will be responsible for major design works requested\nby the provincial agriculture and forestry service offices and will\nhelp them prepare feasibility studies and detailed designs for\nirrigation systems rehabilitation. A project steering committee\nwill coordinate the Project. The committee will be chaired by the\nVice-Minister of MAF. At the provincial level a Provincial Project\nManagement Committee will be constituted, which will guide the\nProvincial Project Office. Provincial extension and training units\n(P-ETUs)  have  already  been  established  in  the  project\nprovinces.  Each  P-ETU  has  three  members,  with  skills  to\nsupervise crop production, livestock, and irrigation sections. The\nspecific  responsibilities  of  WUAs  for  maintaining the  system,\ncollecting fees, and managing it, particularly with reference to\nthe  establishment  of  the  irrigation  service  fee  and  village\ndevelopment  fund,  and  supervisory  responsibilities  will  be\nfinalized through an agreement.\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry\nProcurement The goods and services under the Project will be procured in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works\nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $1.0  million  equivalent,  that  are\nunlikely to attract foreign bidders, are proposed to be awarded\nfollowing local competitive bidding procedures. For civil works\nthat exceed $1.0 million, international competitive bidding as per\nADB procedures will be followed. ONPD will procure equipment\nand  vehicles  through  international  competitive  bidding\nprocedures  for  packages  over  $500,000  and  international\nshopping  procedures  for  packages  of  $500,000  and  less.\nPackages costing less than $100,000 will be procured through\ndirect purchase.\nConsulting Services 167 person-months of international and 224 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services will be required. The consulting\nservices will be recruited in two packages. ADB will finance one\npackage of 85 person-months of international and 84 person-", "v\nmonths of domestic consulting services. An international firm, in\nassociation with a domestic firm, will be recruited to provide the\nrequired  support  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the  engagement  of\ndomestic  consultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  Agence\nFran\u00e7aise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  finance,  in  parallel,\nanother package of 82 person-months of international and 140\nperson-months of domestic consulting services, with consultants\nrecruited as per AFD procedures.\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 31 December 2006\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries About 56 well-functioning and appropriately trained WUAs will\nhave been established in as many irrigation schemes covering\nabout 10,000 ha. The IMT process will ensure that WUAs are\nfinancially self-sufficient and technically capable to carry out the\nnecessary O&M for their irrigation systems on a sustainable\nbasis. The quantified benefits from the IMT process will include\n(i) about 10 percent increase in irrigated area; (ii) 10-15 percent\nincrease in cropping intensity; (iii) 50 and 65 percent increase in\nthe  wet  and  dry  season  paddy  yields,  respectively;  and  (iv)\nadoption of high-value crops on about 20 percent of the cropped\narea.\nThe proposed Project is expected to have a direct impact on\napproximately 62,000 people in the project area. It has been\nestimated that 7-31 percent of households in provinces covered\nby the Project suffer from rice shortages for 2-3 months in a\nyear. Increased paddy yields will ensure that these shortages do\nnot occur in the beneficiary households. After the rehabilitation,\nit  may  be  possible  to  expand  the  command  area  in  many\nsubprojects  by  about  10  percent.  The  beneficiaries  of  this\nexpansion will mostly be poorer farmers in the village who have\nhitherto had no access to irrigation.\nRisks The  major  risks  are  adequate  involvement  of  beneficiaries,\ninstitutional capacity of provincial authorities, efficiency of the\nextension  services  provided,  and  capacity  of  WUAs.  Unless\nincome generation increases significantly, sustainability of the\nsystems cannot be ensured. This can only be achieved if the\nGovernment also provides a suitable policy environment and\nensures adequacy of inputs.", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Decentralized  Irrigation\nDevelopment and Management Sector Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The Government of the Lao PDR has initiated a nationwide program to transfer irrigation\nsystems  to  beneficiaries.  Under  the  irrigation  management  transfer  (IMT)  policy,  the\nGovernment has proposed to fully transfer the assets and responsibility for operation and\nmaintenance (O&M) to the beneficiaries. A strategic plan for the IMT has also been finalized. To\nsupport this initiative, the Government has requested assistance from the Asian Development\nBank (ADB). To assist the Government to assess the feasibility of this approach, a project\npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  was  implemented  between  September  1999  and\nFebruary 2000. The proposed loan for the Project has been included in the firm program for\n2000. The project framework is included as Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. General\n3. The Lao PDR is a landlocked country spread over about 236,800 square kilometers\n(km2), with a population of around 5.07 million. The population is broadly classified into three\ngroups:  Lao  Loum,  Lao  Theung,  and  Lao  Soung.  Lao  Loum  is  the  largest  ethnic  group\nrepresenting about 42 percent of the population and residing in the low-lying areas of the\nMekong River and its major tributaries. Population density is very low at 19 persons/km2, and\nranges between 9 persons/km2 in the rural areas to 134 persons/km2 in Vientiane. About 4.15\nmillion people (82 percent) live in rural areas. The country is divided into 16 provinces, one\nspecial  region  (Xaisomboun),  and  Vientiane  Municipality.  Each  is  headed  by  a  governor,\nassisted  by  field  officials  from  central  ministries.  In  1998,  the  Government  announced  its\nintention to move toward a more decentralized form of governance in several sectors, including\nagriculture and forestry.\n4. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated at around $281. Lack of physical\ninfrastructure remains a major constraint to economic development. The general economic\ndownturn in Asia in recent years has eroded the local currency and resulted in rampant inflation.\nTo address the situation, the Government initiated a series of macroeconomic policy measures\ndesigned to stabilize the kip and reduce inflation. Following the admission of the Lao PDR to the\nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  considerable  potential  to  exploit  export\nmarkets has been created. This would improve with the scheduled 2005 implementation of the\nASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) under ASEAN and entry into the World Trade Organization.\n                                                          \n1\nTA 3189-LAO: Irrigation Management Transfer Project, for $650,000, approved on 27 April 1999.", "2\n2. Economic Importance of Agriculture\n5. Although industry and services have been contributing much to GDP\u2014about 22 percent\nand 25 percent, respectively\u2014agriculture is still the largest contributor, with 53 percent share in\nGDP. However, agricultural production is low due to inefficient practices, such as lack of timely\nand adequate inputs like fertilizer and seed, and weak output markets. Rice is the major crop. The\nirrigated areas on the floodplains of the Mekong River and its major tributaries produce most of\nthe marketable rice. Due to the difficult terrain and poorly developed internal and external\ntransport system, most areas away from the Mekong River are relatively isolated from the\nlowland  areas  of  the  country.  With  a  small  population,  minimal  monetization  of  the  rural\neconomy,  and  low  demand  for  diversified  products,  the  opportunity  for  internal  market\nexpansion is limited. However, with its smaller population and abundant but largely untapped\nnatural resources, which include water and land, the country is in a position to produce for\nexport to neighboring markets.\n6. About 95 percent of the rural population depends on income from agricultural production,\nmainly rice. Field studies undertaken at proposed subproject sites showed that more than half the\npotential beneficiaries are farmers having access to holdings less than 1.5 ha in size. Close to two\nthirds of these farmers have less than 1 ha under irrigation. Socioeconomic surveys have shown\nannual household incomes varying between KN2.5 million and KN25.0 million ($330-$3,300) per\nhousehold per year.\n7. The Government continues to emphasize the need for food security because annual rice\nproduction remains sensitive to the weather. Emphasis is placed on a second rice crop in the dry\nseason to compensate for losses due to floods in lowlands. Simultaneously, traditional agriculture\nis undergoing a process of change due to many external influences such as market prices,\nimproved  seed,  fertilizer,  credit,  mechanization  and  new  technology.  Farmers  must  learn  to\neffectively increase agricultural production in a market economy by exploiting the market better and\nadopting new technology. The Government recently formulated an agriculture sector strategy for\nthe country, with assistance from ADB. The strategy (para. 23) sets the stage for more market-\noriented  development  of  the  sector  and  emphasizes  the  need  for  increased  income-earning\nopportunities in the sector.\n3. Irrigation Subsector\n8. Irrigation systems in the Lao PDR are small by international standards. Only six systems\nhave a command area exceeding 1,000 ha, with the largest system covering only 4,500 ha. If\nthe six largest systems are excluded, the designed average command area of the remaining\nsystems is less than 500 ha and, in many cases, the actual irrigated area is far less than the\ndesigned area. The Department of Irrigation (DOI) reported that, in 1998, there were about\n1,840 irrigation systems with a wet season capacity of approximately 200,000 ha. This is about\n25 percent of the country\u2019s reported 800,000 ha of annually cultivated land. The dry season\nirrigated area was reported at about 98,000 ha, but the actual irrigated area may be less than\nthat officially reported.\n9. Irrigation systems on the lowland floodplains are usually supplied with water from rivers\npumped by diesel or electric pumps. A number of the pump irrigation systems on the floodplains\nwere built in the late seventies, and function with varying degrees of efficiency. Many initially used\ndiesel pumps because of the poor rural power distribution system, but the use of electric pumps is\nincreasing.  Even  now  agriculture  consumes  only  about  6  percent  of  the  total  power,  but", "3\nconsumption is growing at a significant rate. Major problems facing most systems are the recurrent\ncosts of electricity and the occasional cost of major repairs or rehabilitation of pumps, motors and\nswitching  gear.  After  initial  construction,  many  well-functioning  large  pump  systems  received\nadditional technical and investment support from external agencies through projects such as the\nSustainable  Irrigated  Agriculture  Project  (SIRAP).2  These  projects  have  concentrated  on  the\nestablishment of well-functioning water user associations (WUAs) as a means of promoting system\nsustainability.\n10. In the mid-1990s in pursuance of a strategy to improve food production during the dry\nseason, the Government installed a large number of pontoon-mounted pumps, powered by electric\nmotors where electricity is available, or by diesel engines. In some cases, the pumps replaced old\nor unserviceable pumps at fully developed irrigation systems. Commonly, though, the pumps were\ninstalled  at  new  sites  with  only  head  works  constructed  but  no  adequate  technical  input  or\nsupervision.  Construction  of  the  distribution  infrastructure  remained  the  responsibility  of  the\nirrigators and was executed without any standard technical specification being followed and without\nadequate supervision.\n4. Development Issues\na.  Operation and Maintenance\n11. Irrigation  systems  in  the  Lao  PDR  suffer  from  low  levels  of  maintenance.  Farmers\nbelonging to the larger irrigation systems on the river plains have relied on the Government to\nmaintain the infrastructure. With increasing pressure on the national budget, DOI has been\nallocating almost all the available budget for capital works to expand the area under irrigation to\nsatisfy  political  demands,  and  has  allocated  virtually  no  budget  for  O&M.  Funds  are  made\navailable on an ad hoc basis, or aid agencies are pressed to assist whenever repairs are of an\nurgent nature. As a result most of the systems have become run down. To improve O&M, DOI\nhas adopted the IMT approach under which assets are transferred to the beneficiaries so that they\nbear the cost of O&M. However, this is being done without adequate preparation and requires\ntechnical  support.  Farmers  are  beginning  to  understand  that  the  responsibility  for  irrigation\nmaintenance  lies  with  them  and  it  is  necessary  to  establish  well-functioning  WUAs  for  this\npurpose.\nb.  Availability and Distribution of Inputs\n12. Under the ongoing Lao-IRRI Project, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has\ndeveloped sufficient number of improved varieties, including Lao varieties, which have been\ndisseminated in about 80 percent of the area under rice in the lowlands. While the facilities for\nseed multiplication are adequate, demand is not adequate because farmers do not understand\nthe need to periodically replace their seed material. The Government also allows import of seed.\n13. Fertilizer use has become popular and about one-third is currently being made available\nthrough a Japanese Government grant, and distributed by the Agricultural Promotion Bank\n(APB) as credit in kind. It is not subsidized and the Government has found this to be a useful\nmeans of keeping the prices of imported fertilizer in check. Private entrepreneurs have also\n                                                          \n2  SIRAP was funded by the Dutch. Under this project, a systematic process for organizing beneficiaries and\nenabling them to manage the assets and operation and maintenance of irrigation systems was developed and\nimplemented in seven locations. This has formed the basis of the IMT policy of the Government. SIRAP was\nevaluated  in  detail  and  recommendations  were  made  for    wider  application  of  the  procedures.  The\nrecommendations have been incorporated in the Project.", "4\nbeen licensed to import and supply fertilizers. Again the main issue here is the inadequate\nknowledge among farmers about the efficient use of fertilizers.\n14. Providing access to financial services is integral to the Government\u2019s efforts to improve\nagricultural productivity and rural incomes. Most credit for agricultural purposes is extended\nthrough APB, which was set up in 1993. Funds are generally provided by the Bank of Lao PDR\nfor various purposes and APB is also used to deliver external assistance for agricultural credit.\nA detailed review of the rural financial sector revealed that APB does not operate on a viable\nbasis and its coverage of the rural areas is inadequate. There is need to encourage the private\nsector to provide credit in the rural areas, and the Bank of Lao PDR must develop the capacity\nto train staff in rural credit functions. To address this need, technical assistance from ADB3 has\nbeen extended, which is expected to reform APB and improve its coverage and efficiency.\nc.  Extension Support and Decentralization\n15. While the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) provides extension services, its\nefforts have not been well coordinated and have not produced the desired impact. This is mainly\nbecause  extension  was  not  fully  understood  and  was  treated  more  as  an  information\ndissemination  mechanism  rather  than  as  a  sustained  effort  to  demonstrate  and  persuade\nfarmers to use improved farming techniques. However, there is more understanding about the\nneed and methodology of providing extension service at present. Consequently, there is now an\nincreased  demand  for  staff  at  the  national,  provincial  and  district  levels  to  be  trained  in\nextension work and preparation of appropriate training and extension material. This demand is\nalso actively supported by the Government through a campaign to improve the efficiency of\nextension services. The Government has also initiated measures to improve the linkages of\ncentral organizations with those at provincial, district, and village levels.\nd. Beneficiary Participation\n16. Devolving responsibility for maintaining irrigation systems to the beneficiaries generated\na need for establishing water user groups (WUGs). But the MAF Regulation of March 1997 was\nnot sufficient to allow these groups to form themselves into a legally recognizable entity with\nadequate powers for essential functions. Building the capacity of formal WUAs will not only\nprovide farmers with organizational and planning skills but also enhance their ability to interact\nwith public and commercial agencies that may provide services to them. There is a strong\nmovement to commercialize agriculture in the Mekong corridor, and it will be important for farmers\nto be prepared to fully participate in the burgeoning markets for input supply, services, sale of\nproduce, and obtaining credit. WUAs need to be strengthened as institutions capable of providing\nmanagerial support to individual farmers.\ne. Development Funds\n17. A  growing  recognition  that  beneficiaries  must  more  directly  share  in  the  cost  of\ndevelopment projects, even in a small way, has led to the Government\u2019s decision to establish\nvillage development funds (VDFs), as per Prime Ministerial Order 26/PM. The VDF is mainly a\ncost  recovery  mechanism  to  enable  irrigators  to  repay  a  part  of  the  costs  of  irrigation\nconstruction, improvements, or rehabilitation. The group of irrigators was targeted because they\nhave so far been the main beneficiaries of the Government\u2019s expenditure at the village level.\nThe guidelines for VDF have been worked out on the assumption that cost recovery should be\n                                                          \n3\nTA 3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development (TA Cluster), for $2,020,000, approved on 9 March 2000.", "5\nachieved in 20 years. The VDF is to be managed by a village committee specifically established\nfor the purpose. However, establishment of the VDF has not taken into account the need for a\nsystematic program of annual maintenance. The proposed amounts to be collected may not be\nadequate to cover the full O&M costs and they are also not entirely within the control of the\ncurrent WUGs. No provision has been made to fund replacement, or major repairs, of capital\nitems, particularly pumps, engines/motors, and electrical equipment.\n5. Institutional Framework\n18. MAF is responsible for all activities in agriculture. DOI under MAF is mainly responsible\nfor implementing irrigation projects and supports MAF in policy formulation with respect to\nirrigation  development  and  management.  MAF  has  a  reasonably  well  established  base  for\nextension and training activities through its 18 provincial agriculture and forestry service offices\n(PAFSOs) and 132 district agriculture and forestry service offices (DAFSOs). Every province and\ndistrict in which the Project will operate already has an office for extension and outreach to farmers.\nThe staff of these offices have the potential to support the IMT process. The ADB-assisted\nStrengthening and Restructuring of the Irrigation Development Project (SRIDP),4 which was\nimplemented from 1993 to 1998, worked extensively with DOI and the provincial irrigation\nservice (PIS) sections of PAFSOs with marked improvement in staff capacity, particularly at the\nnational level. This capacity needs to be further developed at the provincial and district levels.\nCapacity building for mobilizing WUGs and for improved extension service has also been\nundertaken to a limited extent under the Farmer Irrigated Agriculture Training Project (FIAT) and\nPilot Extension Project (PEP) with effective results (para. 30). DOI has demonstrated adequate\ncapacity to implement development projects including the ongoing ADB-financed Community-\nManaged Irrigation Sector Project.5\n19. During the preparation of the Project, an institutional capacity analysis was carried out.\nSpecific recommendations from the analysis relate mainly to the need to strengthen PAFSOs\nand  DAFSOs.  A  significant  capacity  development  thrust  is  necessary,  as  well  as  a  shift  in\nperceiving client support relationships. Effective extension services that will assist farmers to make\ninformed decisions about their farming system will require a changed approach by extension staff.\nMarket mechanisms and the potential to develop and supply to expanding markets must be\nunderstood. Extension procedures must change and outputs now focused on providing technical\nadvice must refocus on the provision of advice for agriculture planning and production, external\ninfluences, and improved economic as well as environmentally sustainable farming systems. There\nis a need to build on the work of FIAT and PEP in continuing to improve the capacity at\nprovincial level, and develop the district capacity, particularly in the areas of extension and\ntraining.\n20. The  agricultural  sector  strategy  presents  radical  changes  for  organizational\narrangements  within  the  sector,  especially  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels.  The\norganizational arrangements set out in the strategy are considered most effective to support\nagricultural and irrigation development in the Lao PDR, and the success and sustainability of the\nProject will require prompt implementation by the Government. Generally, existing staff numbers\nare sufficient in all agencies at most levels, except in the Agricultural Extension Agency (AEA).\n                                                          \n4  TA 1764-LAO: Strengthening and Restructuring Irrigation Development Project (SRIDP), for $893,000, approved\non 13 December 1993.\n5  Loan 1488-LAO: Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project, for $14.7 million, approved on 21 November\n1996.", "6\nAn increase in staff numbers in AEA and a strengthening of its role have been recommended\nunder the above strategy.\n6. Poverty Issues\n21. According to ADB\u2019s preliminary analysis of the data collected in 1997/98 under the Lao\nExpenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS 2), 46.9 percent of the national population is\nestimated to be below the high poverty line (defined by food and nonfood consumption), while\n25.1 percent are estimated to be below the food poverty line (defined as 2,100 calories per\ncapita per day). LECS 2 further revealed that poverty is much more common in rural areas: 52.1\npercent of the rural population fell under the higher poverty line, while 28.4 percent fell below\nthe food poverty line. It is also evident that the extent of poverty differs from region to region\nand, again, between rural and urban areas. In the rural areas, the poverty gap6 (which measures\nthe severity of poverty) was much higher in 1997/98 for rural areas than for urban areas. A\ndetailed description of poverty in the Lao PDR is in Appendix 2.7 A recent joint study of rural\nareas by the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization noted that the severity of\npoverty is mitigated to some extent by the availability of land, good natural resource base, and\nabsence of extreme weather, that can destroy crops.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n22. The 1993 Socioeconomic Development Plan set out the eight national priority programs\nthrough which national development would be directed.8 The Government also identified nine\nprovinces for priority attention in terms of development programs.9 The agriculture sector policy\noutlined in June 1993 emphasizes attention on (i) food production, (ii) commodity production\nsupport, (iii) stabilization or reduction of slash-and-burn cultivation, (iv) irrigation development,\n(v) agriculture and forestry research, and (vi) human resources development.\n1. Strategic Framework\n23. The agriculture strategy10 presented by the Government in October 1999 to aid agencies\nbuilt on the 1993 policy goals of the Socioeconomic Development Plan and the agriculture sector\npolicy. The new strategy presents some new and innovative approaches, but few of the policy\ngoals  and  priorities  established  during  1993  changed  substantially.  A  major  change  is  the\nintroduction of separate approaches to agricultural development in the Mekong corridor and in the\nuplands. The strategy for the Mekong corridor, in which the proposed project area is mostly\nlocated, is to maintain and accelerate the pace of agricultural diversification and intensification with\nincreased productivity per unit of land, improved value-added processing, and expanded marketing\nand sales. The strategy also emphasizes increased private sector investment, including foreign\n                                                          \n6  The poverty gap is calculated as the percentage of total consumption needed to raise the income of poor\nhouseholds up to the poverty line.\n7  The data in Appendix 2 is based on government publications and differs from the preliminary conclusions of\nADB\u2019s assessment.\n8 The eight programs are (i) food production, (ii) stabilization and reduction of shifting cultivation, (iii) commercial\nproduction,  (iv)  infrastructure  development,  (v)  improved  socioeconomic  management  and  foreign  economic\nrelations, (vi) rural development, (vii) human resources development, and (viii) services development.\n9  The  nine  priority  provinces  are  (i)  Vientiane  Municipality;  (ii)  Vientiane  Province;  (iii)  Borikhamxai;\n(iv) Khammouan; (v) Savannakhet; (vi) Saravane; (vii) Champassak; (viii) Attapeu; and (ix) Xieng Khouang.\n10\nThe strategy was developed with ADB technical assistance: TA 2883-LAO: Agriculture Strategy Study, for\n$600,000, approved on 30 September 1997.", "7\ninvestment,  and  specifically  includes  rehabilitating,  expanding,  and  intensifying  dry  season\nirrigation systems with participatory community-based management.\n24. The devolution of responsibilities and activities to PAFSOs and DAFSOs is central to the\nagriculture strategy. An innovative approach to agricultural extension was adopted, which relies\nheavily on subject matter specialists at provincial level and generalist extension staff at district\nlevel. The Government policy for irrigation development is to shift away from large, capital-\nintensive, government-managed schemes to small, community-managed pump schemes.\n2. Irrigation Sector Strategy and Plan\n25. The Government is actively supporting irrigation sector development. The 1993 Irrigation\nDevelopment  Plan  aimed  at  increasing  rural  incomes  and  stabilizing  rice  availability  by\nexpanding irrigated areas for both wet and dry season production, and to improve O&M of\nexisting irrigation systems. It emphasized the need (i) for farmers and communities to participate\nfor effective and sustainable use of all resources, (ii) for efficient use of water for increased\nagricultural system performance, (iii) to stop watershed degradation, and (iv) for sufficient funds for\ntimely and adequate Government support to the sector at all levels. The plan identified seven\npriority river plains in the nine provinces prioritized under the Socioeconomic Development Plan.11\n26. The national strategy for irrigation development was refined, as recommended in the\nnew agriculture sector strategy developed with ADB assistance. A new strategic development\nplan was adopted with emphasis on water resources planning, irrigation technology, irrigation\nmanagement transfer, community-managed irrigation, and training and extension. Emphasis on\ncommunity-managed  irrigation  was  reiterated  to  achieve  greater  efficiency  in  the  irrigation\nsector. The Government has approved full cost recovery for O&M and transfer of assets to the\nbeneficiaries, which will also result in transferring to them responsibility to meet capital costs. A\nnationwide IMT program has been prepared to entrust O&M responsibility to the beneficiaries.\nThe need for extension service support and greater coordination within MAF, between DOI and\nthe Department of Agriculture (DOA) has also been recognized. Delegation of responsibility to\nthe provincial level has increased the effectiveness of coordination.\n3. Legal Framework\n27. Separate legislation for land, water and forest resources was adopted by the Government\nduring 1997. Land ownership in the Lao PDR is complex. In most cases, land is owned by the\nGovernment and is considered to be under community control. Individuals have the right to use\nthe land provided they use it efficiently and effectively. The Land Law (June 1997) makes it clear\nthat land is under the ownership of the \u201cnational community\u201d and that the State is charged with\nmanagement  in  a  coordinated  and  uniform  manner  throughout  the  country  for  allocation  to\nfamilies and organizations for effective use. The Land Law assigns the responsibility for land\nmanagement to various ministries. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is responsible for centralized\nland management through land registration, titling, and leasing. MAF is responsible for managing\nand determining different categories of agricultural land. The allocation to and right of individuals\nand organizations to use land are the responsibility of the district administrative authority through\nthe issue of land certificates. The Department of Housing and Land Management within MOF is\nsupported by an ongoing World Bank-funded Land Titling Project, that has commenced issuing\n                                                          \n11  The priority river plains are (i) Vientiane Plain, (ii) Borikhamxai Plain, (iii) Sebangfai Plain, (iv) Sebanghiang Plain,\n(v) Sedon Plain, (vi) Champassak Plain, and (vii) Attapeu Plain.", "8\nurban  land  titles.  The  guidelines  for  issuing  land  titles  in  rural  areas  for  both  housing  and\nagricultural uses are yet to be formulated.\n28. The  Government  initiated  integrated  water  resources  planning  and  management  by\npromulgating the Water and Water Resources Law in October 1996, prepared the National Water\nSector Profile in 1998, and strengthened water sector coordination by establishing the Water\nResources  Coordination  Committee  (WRCC)  in  February  1999.  WRCC  is  responsible  for\nformulating  policy,  strategy,  and  action  plans  in  the  water  sector,  and  for  monitoring  the\nimplementation of action plans, laws, and regulations for water resources management.12 With\nADB assistance the Government is preparing a draft National Water Policy and developing a legal\nframework for drafting cross-sector regulations to implement the Water and Water Resources\nLaw13 (para. 43).\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n29. Since 1975, many external agencies have been involved in irrigation construction in the\nLao PDR. They include Australian Agency for International Development, European Community,\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Mekong  River  Commission,  Netherlands,  United\nNations Capital Development Fund, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United\nStates  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  World  Bank.  Other  projects  that  have\nconcentrated more specifically on IMT, agricultural extension, and institutional development in\nrelated areas have been SIRAP, FIAT, and PEP. Appendix 3 provides additional information on\nexternal support to the irrigation subsector.\n30. SIRAP, funded by the Government of the Netherlands, was administered by the Mekong\nRiver Commission. It was implemented from 1993 to 1998 and pilot-tested a model for IMT at\nsix specific sites. Project evaluation was completed in 1999 and recommendations were made\nto  improve  the  IMT  process  for  wider  replication.  FIAT  was  funded  by  UNDP.  Under\nimplementation since 1994, it is nearing completion. It focused on developing procedures for\ntraining and strengthening WUAs. It has enabled MAF, PAFSOs, and DAFSOs to acquire the\ncapacity to organize and train these WUAs. It has developed trainers and training activities and\nmaterials suitable for training farmers. FIAT was evaluated in 1999 and its impact on the\ncapacity of PAFSOs and DAFSOs to undertake training activities was noted. The project also\ndemonstrated that training and extension activities can be undertaken simultaneously. PEP,\nwhich has been under implementation since 1996, is funded by the Swiss Government. It was\ndeveloped to establish an extension network at the PAFSO and DAFSO levels, strengthen the\ncapacity of extension service staff, and improve the services they provide. As a result, MAF\napplied several measures to improve extension services and adopted recommendations for\nadministrative reorganization. The design of the proposed Project drew substantially on the\nexperience and recommendations of these projects. It was also prepared in close cooperation\nwith a proposed World Bank-financed agriculture development project.\n31. ADB has been supporting the development of agriculture and the irrigation subsector in\nthe Lao PDR since 1975. It has provided loan funds for construction or rehabilitation of larger\n                                                          \n12  ADB assisted the Government in capacity building in WRCC to improve interagency coordination in the water\nsector and preparing a national water sector action plan through TA 3006-LAO: Institutional Strengthening of the\nWater Resources Coordination Committee, for $260,000, approved on 15 April 1998. The TA prepared the Water\nSector Action Plan through a participatory approach to address and prioritize cross-sector water issues such as\nthe need for water policy development, integrated water resources management in river basins, information\nmanagement, and community awareness.\n13  TA 3205-LAO: Implementation of the Water Sector Action Plan, for $300,000, approved on 9 June 1999.", "9\npumped  schemes  along  the  Mekong  and  its  major  tributaries  between  1975  and  1990.\nImplementation of the schemes demonstrated the technical capability of DOI in managing such\nconstruction.  Unfortunately,  few  schemes  were  sustainable  due  to  inadequate  O&M\narrangements, and many have since fallen into disrepair. Subsequently, no further loans were\nprovided to the irrigation subsector until 1997. The Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project\n(footnote 5) approved in 1996 is supporting the construction of community-based irrigation in the\nprovinces  of  Houaphanh,  Xieng  Khouang,  Vientiane  and  Borikhamxai,  as  well  as  in  the\nXaisomboun Special Zone. In addition, the project for Institutional Strengthening of the WRCC\n(footnote 12) commenced in 1999 and is working to develop the implementation guidelines for the\nWater and Water Resources Act (1996).\nD. Lessons Learned\n32. The main lessons incorporated in the project design concern farmer-managed irrigation,\nwhich will only be sustainable if (i) WUAs receive sufficient training and are allowed to operate\neffectively  with  financial  management  and  all  technical  aspects  of  irrigation  operation,\nmanagement,  and  maintenance;  (ii)  farmers  understand  and  accept  that  they  are  fully\nresponsible for all aspects of irrigation system operations, management, and maintenance;\n(iii) physical repair/rehabilitation work is undertaken properly with adequate attention to survey,\ndesign, construction, and quality control so as to provide a system sufficient to give irrigators the\nmeans to increase production as anticipated; (iv) profit from crop production remains sufficient\nto allow for cost recovery; and (v) private sector support for the supply of agricultural inputs,\nincluding reliable technical service supplies and spare parts, are available direct to farmers, at\ncompetitive market prices. Finally, to ensure sustainability, the Government has to continue to\nextend extension and technical support to the systems even when the transfer process is\ncompleted.\n33. SIRAP developed a process for IMT based on five major steps involving two phases: the\npreparation phase and the implementation phase. The process proceeds in a linear fashion with\ncontinuous attention and priority to (i) WUA development, (ii) crop development and related\nagricultural extension activities, (iii) market development, (iv) improved access to and use of\nagricultural inputs, and (v) appropriate O&M. The SIRAP process, developed through extensive\nfield testing, has been demonstrated to be effective in establishing and strengthening WUAs to\nthe point where they are capable of managing the normal operation of the irrigation systems. In\naddition, it is necessary for the Government to strengthen the support services.\n34. A  large  body  of  lessons  from  completed  similar  ADB  projects  and  special  impact\nevaluation studies have been taken into account. The International Water Management Institute\n(IWMI)  has  undertaken  considerable  research  on  IMT  and  has  provided  a  comprehensive\nanalysis  of  the  prerequisites  to  ensure  the  success  of  this  process.  IWMI  states  that  an\nadequate framework for irrigation development must address (i) legal issues, (ii) governance,\n(iii) organization, and (iv) finance. IWMI recognized that these aspects overlap and should be\naddressed simultaneously. A successful national framework for irrigation would consider clear,\nsecure, and transferable water rights; decentralized management organizations; the role of the\ngovernment as facilitator and regulator, not controller; accountability of all parties; and financial\nautonomy and sustainability.14\n                                                          \n14  In a 1999 publication undertaken in conjunction with Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Zuzammenarbeit (GTZ) and the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), IWMI identified and further discussed the need\nto address issues specific to IMT, to ensure that these programs are successfully implemented.", "10\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n35. Under the recently adopted poverty reduction strategy, broad-based economic growth\nwill continue to be supported if the interventions simultaneously correct policy and institutional\nweaknesses, and infrastructure investments will be directed to projects having a greater impact\non the poor. ADB's operational strategy for the Lao PDR is to place high priority on sustainable\neconomic  growth  so  as  to  raise  the  level  of  national  income.  The  strategy  also  places\nimportance on policy reform, social services, and human development to enhance the economic\nenvironment and incentive framework. ADB's priority is to support sustainable economic growth\nand development through infrastructure investments that will have a positive impact on the\ndomestic economy. ADB support is directed at bringing the rural sector into the market economy\nto enable the majority of the population to take part in the process of reform and development.\nADB assistance to stabilize cultivation systems focuses on helping to provide options in the form\nof infrastructure, land titling regimes, and market development. The Project design takes into\naccount general ADB policies as well as ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the Lao PDR. It also builds\non the outputs of the series of earlier grant-funded ADB activities.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n36. ADB has engaged MAF and DOI in an ongoing process of policy dialogue on sector\ndevelopment policies governing institutional, economic, and sustainability issues. Several issues\nare directly relevant to sustainability of the IMT process, where ADB has encouraged the\nGovernment to adopt specific measures to further improve the efficiency of the sector and\nencourage community ownership.\n1. Sector Development Policies\n37. Prime Ministerial Order No.26/PM issued in December 1998 was to allow the full transfer\nof  all  irrigation  projects  to  community  organizations.  While  this  is  a  major  step  affecting\nnationwide IMT, the order appears to concentrate more on the financial than on operational\nmatters and is aimed to encourage irrigators repay a portion of the costs of Government\ninvestment  (including  external  grant  or  loan  funding)  for  irrigation  infrastructure  through\ncontribution to the VDF. To establish comprehensive enabling regulations, ADB assisted in\npreparing MAF Ministerial Regulation No. 1149/MAF, issued on 27 June 2000 which elaborates\nthe process to be adopted under the IMT program to ensure its sustainability. Under the new\nMAF regulation, an IMT process has been introduced which includes Government support\nmeasures both before and after transfer to beneficiaries.15\n2. Village Development Fund, Irrigation Service Fees, and Cost Recovery\n38. Adequate contributions from beneficiaries to meet the costs of maintaining assets and\nutilizing them to improve income levels are key to the sustainability of the IMT process. Prime\nMinisterial Order 26, 18 December 1998, allows farmers to own and manage irrigation assets.\nTo ensure adequate maintenance of the assets, it was made mandatory for WUGs to establish\na VDF. The contributions to VDF are specified in terms of kilograms (kg) of paddy and can be\n                                                          \n15\n  Under MAF Regulation 1149, the support measures will take the following forms: (i) establishment of a water\nuser association development committee to assist the water user groups to become WUAs, to assist in preparing\na rehabilitation plan, and to provide coordination support; (ii) establishment of a construction committee to\nfacilitate and supervise construction work; (iii) advice on bank credit; (iv) updated information on government\npolicies and guidelines and rules; and (v) training WUAs in technical aspects including agriculture, finance,\nmarketing, planning, credit, agro-industry, and gender development.", "11\npaid either in cash or in kind.16 Draft implementing guidelines for VDF, issued along with the\nFinance Minister\u2019s instructions No. 0043/MOF of 1 January 1999, indicate the proportions to be\npaid to the Government and to be retained for O&M and other expenditures. While there is\nadequate legal basis for establishing and operating the VDF, it is necessary to consolidate the\nclarifications that have been issued regarding the working arrangement for VDF. The Government\nhas agreed to do a review and issue consolidated instructions for establishing and operating the\nVDF.\n39. The  extent  and  adequacy  of  the  VDF  collection  were  discussed  in  detail  with  the\nGovernment. It was agreed that an irrigation service fee (ISF) would be levied under the Project\nto support the full funding of routine O&M costs. The amount of ISF will vary from site to site\ndepending on specific needs. The WUA will set the rate of the ISF on an annual basis, with the\nassistance of the concerned DAFSO. ISF requirements are expected to range from $25 to $30\nper ha per year, depending on the type of irrigation system and its requirements. At present\ncosts  and  exchange  rates,  this  would  amount  to  a  rice  contribution  of  270-325  kg\npaddy/ha/year.  ISF  takes  into  account  all  O&M  costs  and  expected  incremental  costs  on\naccount of enhanced electricity tariff.\n40. The Government recognizes the need to ensure that WUAs have the ability to undertake\ncapital replacement also on their own. While full replacement cost is recoverable over the life of\neach subproject, it may not be practical and may act as a disincentive to beneficiary farmers.\nHence, an approach under which partial recovery of capital cost amounting to about 15-20\npercent over the subproject life is combined with the obligation to meet the remaining amounts\nthrough commercial borrowings at the time required was discussed and agreed to by the\nbeneficiaries and the Government. Village development committees will set aside at least 50\npercent of the VDF collections retained within the village for this purpose and keep the amount\nin a separate account by the WUA. Beginning with the present level of about $14 per ha per\nyear  prescribed  under  the  regulations,  WUAs  will  also  progressively  increase  the  VDF\ncontributions to about $21 per ha per year by project completion.\n41. Affordability of the fees to farmers (paras. 38-40) was the subject of detailed discussions\nat district workshops conducted at both the core subproject sites. The proposed contributions\nwere discussed in terms of rationale and costs to farmers. Farmers at both sites understood the\nneed for the fees and indicated their willingness and ability to pay.\n3. Land Ownership\n42. The issue of land ownership is critical to effective functioning of WUAs. A tax certificate\nin the name of the head of the household is issued for payment of the land tax and is currently\nregarded as establishing ownership. But this often results in denying the rights of women in the\nhouseholds. From a strictly legal point of view, the holders of these certificates are not vested\nwith any ownership rights, thus creating a misleading situation for the farmers. Since the land\n                                                          \n16  They amount to 150 kg/ha for gravity systems, 200 kg/ha per year for electric pump systems, and 100 kg/ha per\nyear for diesel pump systems. A portion of the contribution is to be paid to the district development fund and the\nbalance retained for O&M and other village development works. At one end of the scale, 20 percent of the funds\ncollected for gravity-fed systems is paid to the district treasury and 80 percent remains with the WUG. At the\nother end of the scale, for diesel engine pump systems, only 5 percent is paid to the district treasury while 95\npercent remains with the WUG. The VDF draft implementing guidelines note that repayments must be made until\nthe combined amount paid to the Government through VDF equals the capital cost of the irrigation system, or that for\n20 years, after which no more payments are required.", "12\ntitling project may take some time to cover agricultural land, the issue of land certificates17 is\nconsidered  essential  as  an  additional  measure  to  assure  ownership  when  the  formal\nadjudication process for issue of land titles is undertaken. Procedures to issue land certificates\nhave been clarified and they will be issued to farmers at the subproject sites in the initial stage\nof implementation.\n4. Water Rights\n43. Water resources in the Lao PDR are crucial to its economic development and the well-\nbeing of its people. ADB has assisted the Government in building the capacity of WRCC to\nimprove interagency coordination in the water sector and preparing a national water sector\naction plan.18 The action plan used a participatory approach and is intended to address and\nprioritize cross-sector water issues such as the need for water policy development, integrated\nwater  resources  management  in  river  basins,  information  management,  and  community\nawareness.  ADB  has  also  assisted  in  preparing  the  draft  National  Water  Policy  and  in\ndeveloping  a  legal  framework  to  draft  the  implementing  decree  for  the  Water  and  Water\nResources Law.19 The draft Water Policy is under preparation and it has been recommended\nthat it be adopted by August 2001. The implementation regulations will cover issues such as\nwater allocation, licensing of water use, fund for watershed and water resources protection,\ngroundwater  use,  and  powers  and  duties  of  central  and  local  governments.  It  was\nrecommended that they be approved by the Government by August 2002.\n5. Water User Associations\n44. MAF issued Ministerial Regulation No. 156/AF, 11 March 1997, for the establishment\nand operation of WUAs. However, further regulation is required to establish a legal framework\nclarifying  and  protecting  the  rights  of  individuals  and  communities  and  providing  them  with\nsufficient authority to perform O&M and other management responsibilities. The Government\nsubmitted a draft regulation, prepared with ADB support under TA 3189 (footnote 1), which\nincludes the recommendations published during the 1999 seminar of international agencies on\nirrigation.  On  27  June  2000,  MAF  issued  Ministerial  Regulation  No.  1150/AF  improving  the\nprovisions under Regulation No. 156/AF and in line with the proposed draft. Under this new\nregulation, WUAs will exercise the following functions: (i) own property, (ii) make and enforce\ninternal  rules  and  regulations,  (iii)  select  authorized  representatives  without  external\ninterference, (iv) raise funds from its members as contribution to ISF and other funds, (v) open\nand operate bank accounts, (vi) extract water from a specified source, and (vii) to enter into\ncontracts. These are considered essential for WUAs to function effectively and develop the\norganizational capacity to sustainably manage the systems. With additional support provided\nunder the Project for WUA capacity development, the WUAs are expected to function efficiently.\n                                                          \n17  A land certificate grants the holder the right to use the land for a specific purpose and for a certain duration,\nwithout however conferring legal ownership rights. Nevertheless, as specified in the Land Law, holders of those\ncertificates are granted the right to apply for a title provided the land has been used in conformity with the\nobjectives and regulations and if no objection exists. Therefore, the issuance of a land certificate may be\nconsidered an essential initial step before a land title is issued.\n18  TA 3006\u2013LAO: Institutional Strengthening of Water Resources Coordination Committee, for $260,000, approved\non 16 April 1997.\n19\n  TA 3205\u2013LAO: Implementation of Water Sector Action Plan, for $300,000, approved on 9 June 1999.", "13\n6. Institutional Development for Agricultural Extension\n45. In its agricultural sector strategy, the Government has committed staff numbers and a\nnew approach to agricultural extension. Project success and sustainability are dependent on the\nGovernment\u2019s implementation of the strategy, particularly in the important area of agricultural\nextension. Government commitments under the strategy, necessary for sustainable project\noutputs, include the reorganization of DAFSOs into the following three sections: (i) farming\nsystem extension workers (FSEWs) who would work as generalists in all fields relating to\nagriculture; (ii) administration, covering finance and management functions; and (iii) technical\nsupport and supervision to manage and coordinate the movements and activities of the FSEWs.\nThe Project will require the full support of PAFSO and DAFSO in every province and district in\nwhich it operates. A fully functioning PAFSO and DAFSO will require the establishment of a\ncareer framework for their staffs that takes into account career management and training, and\ndefines their roles. The Government has approved these changes.\n7.  Gender Issues\n46. It is recognized that women farmers must also be able to participate equally along with\nmen farmers in meetings, training courses, and on study tours. It is necessary to ensure that\nwomen are registered as members of WUAs and can be selected for WUA, VDF, and system\nworking team (SWT) committees. To encourage the full participation of women in positions of\nresponsibility, it was agreed that at least 20 percent of all such positions will be filled by women.\nTo allow women greater access to technology transfer and to enable them to derive the full\nbenefits of the extension process, MAF has agreed to increase the number of women extension\nworkers in DAFSOs to at least 20 percent of such staff, with at least two women staff in each\nDAFSO.\n8. Budget for Rehabilitation\n47. Most of the budget of DOI at national and provincial levels is for construction of irrigation\ninfrastructure, in keeping with the Government\u2019s policy to increase dry season food production.\nExpenditure is incurred mainly for new construction activities, and very little provision is made\nfor  rehabilitation  or  maintenance.  The  Government\u2019s  explanation  is  that  the  assets  are\nconstructed and then handed over to beneficiaries for maintenance; hence, there is no need for\nany maintenance expenditure. A special budget is sought in case of damage due to natural\ncalamities.  However,  with  the  recommendation  under  the  agriculture  sector  strategy,  the\nGovernment is keen to divert increased investments to rehabilitation. The Government agreed\nthat at least 15 percent of the national as well as the provincial budgets of the project provinces\nwould be earmarked for rehabilitation and maintenance of irrigation assets from 2001. This\nwould be progressively increased and reach 30 percent by project completion. The adequacy of\nthis allocation would be reviewed during the midterm review of the Project.\nIV.      THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n48. Irrigation systems constructed over the last two decades vary in size. While the upland\nsystems have generally relied on small diversion weirs and distribution by gravity, the majority of\nthe systems in the lowlands along the Mekong River are pump irrigation schemes. Many have\nbeen in existence for over five years, but have been poorly maintained and hence do not\nfunction efficiently. The schemes established between 1996 and 1998 under the Government\u2019s", "14\nNational Pump Irrigation Management Program (NPIMP), are poorly designed and have not fully\nrealized their potential. A program of systematically rehabilitating existing irrigation systems with\nspecific attention to their sustainability, especially in the lowlands, will significantly improve the\nefficiency of agriculture.\n49. Regular O&M of the irrigation systems will impose a considerable burden on the budget.\nBudget constraints force the Government to allocate inadequate amounts for rehabilitation and\nO&M; hence, there is no systematic program for rehabilitation and O&M of existing irrigation\nsystems. Moreover, the available budget allocations are distributed on an ad hoc basis. The\nsuccessful functioning of WUAs is contingent on their legal status and the extent to which the\nbeneficiaries fully understand the role and functions of WUAs. For this, adequate preparatory\nactivities  are  needed.  These  organizations  should  be  established  within  a  proper  legal\nframework  and  functionaries  need  to  be  trained  in  administrative,  financial  and  technical\nmatters. The SIRAP experience has demonstrated that beneficiaries can manage the system\nefficiently  and  that  there  is  considerable  sense  of  ownership  in  the  IMT  program.\nSimultaneously, extension service support is needed to ensure adoption of appropriate cropping\npatterns and better agronomic practices. Without that support, beneficiaries will find it difficult to\nrealize  higher  incomes.  Thus  their  capacity  and  willingness  to  pay  levies  for  O&M  and\nreplacement costs will be affected.\n50. The Government\u2019s strategic emphasis on increasing food production as a means to\nreduce poverty is supported by ADB\u2019s Agriculture Strategy Study. Irrigation is recognized as\nvital to support the Government\u2019s strategy for increasing food production, mainly rice. This is\nexpected to result in higher farm incomes in the beneficiary households, a large percentage of\nwhom are poor. Rehabilitation of irrigation assets combined with improved extension rather than\nexpansion under new irrigation schemes as a means of increasing agricultural production is\nemphasized in the agriculture sector strategy.\n51. Following this, a new strategic development plan has been adopted under which the\nGovernment is transferring irrigation assets to beneficiaries and emphasizing rehabilitation. A\nnationwide  IMT  program  has  been  prepared  to  implement  this  approach.  MAF  has  been\nreorganized and is better coordinated at central and provincial levels. The institutional capacity\nof DOI has been improved and it has demonstrated its institutional capacity to implement a\nsector type project under the ongoing ADB-financed Community-Managed Irrigation Sector\nProject (footnote 5). A sector approach will enable DOI to implement the IMT program in six\nselect provinces that have a large concentration of pump irrigation systems.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n52. The overall goal in the sector is to facilitate sustainable growth in agricultural production,\nwhich will result in (i) overall economic growth through increased yields and better quality of\nagricultural produce, and (ii) poverty reduction through increased agricultural income for farmers\nand employment generation for the landless. The Project aims to establish sustainable irrigated\nagriculture through the IMT process and strengthening of WUAs, agricultural extension, and the\ncapacity of DOI/PAFSO/DAFSO staff. The Project will be implemented in six provinces and will\ncover about 56 irrigation systems with a total command area of about 10,000 ha.\n53. The Project objectives will be achieved by (i) assisting irrigators to organize themselves\nin WUAs, which will provide institutional and management support in the rehabilitation and O&M\nof irrigation systems; (ii) rehabilitating existing irrigation systems, in cooperation with WUAs, as\npart of the IMT process; (iii) providing appropriate extension services to farmers to help them", "15\nmake  rational  decisions  concerning  their  farm  management  and  marketing  systems;\n(iv) increasing the Government capacity and enhancing the capacity of PAFSO and DAFSO, to\nsupport and sustain farmer-managed irrigation; and (v) providing institution building support to\nWUAs. A sector approach will be adopted, that will provide the Government with flexibility to cover\nspecific subprojects based on the criteria agreed upon with ADB.\n1. Project Area\n54. In consultation with MAF, it was agreed that the Project would be implemented in six\nprovinces, Borikhamxai, Vientiane Municipality, Vientiane Province, Savannakhet, Sayaburi and\nLouang Phrabang, covering existing irrigation systems. Seventeen districts20 within these provinces\nwere chosen in consultation with the respective PAFSOs and DAFSOs, and taking the total\nnumber  of  schemes  in  the  district  into  consideration.  The  procedures  adopted  to  select  the\nproposed project area are described in Appendix 4. Emphasis will be on selecting subprojects that\nwill enhance the impact on the poor. It is believed that at least a third of the beneficiaries in each\nsubproject live below the poverty line.\n55. The project area is largely in the plains along the Mekong and its major tributaries. The\ntopography is mainly low level plains, with soils derived from alluvial deposits, but are not very\nfertile. Over 80 percent of the cultivable area is devoted to paddy in the wet season. Only about 12\npercent of the area has access to irrigation in the dry season, and generally grows rice as the main\ncrop. The total population of the six provinces is about 2.5 million, of whom about 45 percent live in\nrural areas. Farming is the main source of income for over 90 percent of the population and\naccounts for over 60 percent of the total income of households. While there is little landlessness,\naverage landholding is about 1.4 ha, which is cultivated with family labor. Rice accounts for most of\nthe agricultural production. Annual family incomes vary between KN4.0 million and KN10.0 million.\nHigher annual incomes accrue mainly because of larger landholding and higher proportion of\nnonagricultural income in areas near larger cities. Infrastructure facilities, especially roads, are\ngood, ensuring market access. Electricity is also available in most of the probable subproject sites.\nHowever, provision of education and health facilities is currently inadequate.\n2. Components\na. Development of Water User Associations\n56. The sustainability of the IMT process depends entirely on the capacity of the WUAs to\nassume the responsibilities associated with the process. The present WUGs are loosely knit and\ndo not understand the process, except that the O&M costs have to be paid for by the water users.\nTherefore, the Project will provide support at various levels to the WUAs\u2014in all about 56\u2014that will\nbe established at each subproject site. Membership will vary depending on subproject size, but\nmay comprise between 50 and 100 families. The focus will be on educating and training the water\nusers about the IMT process and to develop a sense of ownership for the process. The next step\nwould be to formally establish the WUAs and then train them in administrative responsibilities.\nThis would be followed by technical training in extension and O&M activities for select WUA\nofficers/members. Support would also be extended to create the capacities for more efficient\nfinancial management and better understanding of market mechanisms and development. This\nwould include support for streamlining the present guidelines for establishing VDFs, improving\n                                                          \n20    The  17  districts  selected  are:  Pakkading,  Pakxan,  and  Thaphabat  in  Borikhamxai;  Champhon,  Xaibouri,\nSaypouthong, and Songkhon in Savannakhet; Hatsaifong, Pakngum, Saythani, and Sikhottabong in Vientiane\nMunicipality; Keoudom, Phonhong, Thoulakhom, and Viengkham in Vientiane Province; Louang Phrabang in\nLouang Phrabang; and Phiang in Sayaburi.", "16\naccess to credit from the APB or private commercial banks, and reviewing the actual working of\nVDFs. This would enable WUAs to acquire the capacity to collect and administer VDF and ISF\nfunds. Specific support would also help develop the potential among the WUAs to identify and\nrespond to market developments, that can significantly enhance farm incomes.\nb. Rehabilitation of Irrigation Infrastructure\n57. This component, which receives the bulk of project funds, will support the rehabilitation of\nabout 56 irrigation systems at selected subproject sites in 17 districts. It will include repairs to the\npump sets and review of the appropriateness of the present design of the head-works and\ndistribution systems. A survey will establish the command area and identify the beneficiaries,\nincluding the actual extent owned by each individual. The WUAs with the technical support of the\nconcerned PAFSO and DAFSO will assist in preparing the detailed design for the rehabilitation\nworks  and  establish  its  viability.  The  technical  parameters  including  estimated  costs  will  be\nchecked by the Survey, Study, and Design Center (SSDC) of MAF. Most rehabilitation packages\nare  expected  to  include  civil  works  in  the  nature  of  repairs  to  head-works  and  distribution\nchannels.  Repairs  to  platforms  on  which  pumps  are  mounted  are  required  in  most  cases.\nElectrical control equipment may need to be replaced. Action in parallel will establish the WUAs\nand conduct a preliminary education package to ensure stakeholder involvement and sense of\nownership  as  part  of  the  IMT  package.  The  systems  will  be  rehabilitated  to  bring  them  to\ntechnically acceptable standards with design, construction, and quality control sufficient to ensure\nan effective operating life of 15 years.\nc. Enhancement of Extension Capacity\n58. An agricultural extension system is necessary to raise farmer awareness of and ability to\nuse new technologies. An effective extension system will develop farmer capacity to identify\nconstraints, try new technologies, and make decisions for ongoing improvements in production.\nThis component includes specialist services for technology transfer for more suitable cropping\npatterns, adoption of improved seed, more efficient use of fertilizer, and better water utilization.\nWUAs will be assisted in improving their financial management and understanding market\ndevelopment.  Training  will  include  improved  materials  and  field  study  tours  for  farmers  to\nfamiliarize them with suggested best practices. While training is designed to enhance capacity\nat 6 PAFSOs, 17 DAFSOs, and in the 56 WUAs, the emphasis is on strengthening the district-\nlevel capacity to provide know-how and guide agronomic practices.\nC. Cost Estimates\n59. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $24.2 million equivalent including interest,\ntaxes, and duties and expected contributions of participants. Of the total cost, about $19.0 million\nor about 78.5 percent is the foreign exchange cost and $5.2 million equivalent or about 21.5\npercent is the local currency cost. The summary of the cost estimates is given in Table 1. More\ndetailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 5.", "17\nTable 1:  Project Cost Estimatesa\n($ million)\n    Foreign             Local              Total\nComponent    Exchange         Currency          Cost\nBase Cost\n1.

Financing Plan\n60. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan in the amount of $15.5 million equivalent from its\nSpecial Funds resources, to finance about 64 percent of the total project cost including 77 percent\nof the foreign exchange cost and 15 percent of the local currency cost. ADB funds will finance the\ncosts  of  establishing  WUAs,  rehabilitating  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  project  management\nactivities.  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  provide,  on  a  parallel  basis,  the\nequivalent of $2.7 million to finance the costs of consultants, equipment, and materials to enhance\nextension capacities. The local financing will cover part of the costs relating to civil works and\nconsulting services, but excludes customs duties and taxes. The proposed ADB loan will have a\nrepayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and will carry an interest rate of\n1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The AFD\nfinancing  will  be  a  grant.  Significant  contribution  from  beneficiaries,  estimated  to  be  about\n17 percent, is expected by way of labor for rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure. Beneficiaries are\nwilling to make this contribution to reduce the overall cost of rehabilitation. The proposed financing\nplan is in Table 2, and a financing plan by component is included as Appendix 6.\nTable 2:  Financing Plana\n($ million)\n    Foreign       Local       Total\nSource    Exchange    Currency       Cost    Percent\nADB 14.7 0.8 15.5 64\nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de\n  Developpement 2.6 0.1 2.7 11\nGovernment 0.7 1.3 2.0 8\nBeneficiaries 1.0 3.0 4.0 17\n      Total 19.0 5.2 24.2 100\na\nTotals may not tally due to rounding.", "18\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Organization\n61. The Executing Agency for the Project will be MAF, and DOI will be the Implementing\nAgency. The Office of the National Project Director (ONPD), which has been established, will be\nresponsible for overall project implementation and coordination at the national level, and have full\nauthority to liaise with ADB and AFD. ONPD will be headed by the national project director\n(NPD), a senior DOI staff who has already been appointed. The NPD will be assisted by a\nsenior extension officer from DOA, who will be designated as a senior extension coordinator;\none master trainer (MT); two irrigation engineers; and other Government staff. Under the close\nguidance and supervision of ONPD, PAFSOs of participating provinces will be responsible for\nday-to-day implementation at the subproject level with assistance from DAFSOs and WUAs. The\nSSDC in DOI will be responsible for major design works requested by the PAFSOs and will help\nprepare feasibility studies and detailed design for irrigation systems rehabilitation. The senior\nextension coordinator will coordinate the extension and training programs.\n62. A project steering committee (PSC) will meet quarterly during the first two years and every\nsix months thereafter to provide overall supervision and guidance. The PSC will be chaired by the\nVice-Minister of MAF, with the NPD as member/secretary. The PSC will also include the directors\nof the Departments of Planning, Irrigation and Agriculture, the head of the AEA, representatives of\nDepartment of Livestock and Fisheries, Department of Forestry, Department of Financial Policy,\nMOF,  State  Planning  Committee,  National  Audit  Office,  Committee  for  Investment  and\nCooperation, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Lao Women's Union (LWU), National Development Fund\nwithin MOF, and APB. The provinces will be represented by the vice governors of Savannakhet,\nBorikhamxai, Vientiane Province and Vientiane Municipality (as vice chairmen); and head of\nPAFSOs of Louang Phrabang and Sayaburi. The chairperson could invite any other official to\nattend these meetings.\n63. A provincial project management committee (PPMC) will be constituted with the vice-\ngovernor of the respective provinces as chair within three months after loan effectiveness. The\nPPMC will guide the provincial project office (PPO) to be established. The PPMC will coordinate\nthe Project at the provincial level and will include the head of PAFSO and representatives from the\nService of Finance, LWU, and APB. Within three months of loan effectiveness, a PPO will be\nestablished  in  each  project  province  with  representatives  from  the  Service  of  Planning,\nAgriculture, AEA, Livestock and Fisheries and Forestry (to be assigned by the PAFSO head). An\nIMT coordinator from the Provincial Irrigation Service (PIS) in every province has already been\nappointed and will join the PPO as manager at the provincial level and coordinator of the PPMC.\nThe IMT coordinator will be responsible for all engineering aspects, but all activities will be\nundertaken with a high level of cooperation and coordination from the PPO team under the\nguidance of the PPMC. One person from the provincial agriculture service will be appointed as\ndeputy manager of the PPO and will coordinate extension and training\n64. Provincial extension and training Units (P-ETUs) have already been established in 13\nprovinces, including all six provinces in which the Project would operate under FIAT and PEP. In\neach PAFSO, trained staff members remain as the nucleus of the P-ETU, which consists of\nthree persons, one from  each  of  the  crop production, livestock, and irrigation sections.  The\nP-ETU would remain as part of PAFSOs after project completion and as such would not be an\nisolated entity within PAFSO. Since the Project will also be involved with rehabilitation work\nrequiring higher technical knowledge from the PIS, it has been agreed that one additional\nperson from the PIS be attached to the P-ETU for the duration of the Project. It has also been", "19\nagreed that six DAFSO staff assigned as FSEWs be trained at the commencement of the Project\nto be assigned to DAFSOs in which subprojects are selected under each batch.\n2. Specific Arrangements\n65. DOI has undertaken a preliminary screening of the potential subprojects in consultation with\nthe respective PAFSOs and has determined that (i) more than a third of the total beneficiaries in\neach subproject would be below the poverty line, and (ii) the subproject would provide irrigation to\nat least 100 ha in the wet season or 50 ha in the dry season. An initial list of candidate subprojects\nhas been agreed to with ADB. DOI will ensure that all subprojects will meet these criteria. In\nconsultation  with  stakeholders,  a  detailed  feasibility  study  has  been  completed  for  two  core\nsubprojects\u2014one in Nakhong and another in Chom Thong\u2014and the economic and financial\nviability of the rehabilitation program established. More than 40 percent of beneficiaries at both\nsites are poor farmers.\na. Establishment of Water User Associations\n66. PAFSOs will first undertake stakeholder consultations at each subproject site through\nDAFSOs to establish the interest of community members in the rehabilitation program and\nacceptance of the transfer of assets and O&M responsibilities. PAFSOs will also confirm the\nwillingness of beneficiaries to contribute labor for the rehabilitation program and the subsequent\ncost recovery procedures. Then PAFSOs will proceed to constitute the WUGs and take steps to\nestablish WUAs as per regulations. ONPD will ensure that at least 20 percent of the office\nholders and committee members are women. A transfer agreement will be executed between\nthe  concerned  DAFSO,  PAFSO,  and  WUA  on  the  list  of  assets  transferred  and  on  the\nresponsibilities of each during the rehabilitation phase and subsequent operation of the system.\nThe agreement will set the specific responsibilities of WUAs for system maintenance, collection\nof fees, and management, particularly with reference to the establishment of VDF and ISF\naccounts, and the supervisory responsibilities of PAFSO. ONPD will approve each of these\nagreements. It will assist in this process by developing a model transfer agreement within six\nmonths of loan effectiveness. In consultation with DOI, NPD will submit a report to ADB at the\nend of each year for the first three years, confirming the establishment of WUAs under each\nbatch and the opening of suitable accounts for VDF and ISF. Benefit monitoring and evaluation\n(BME) reports will monitor the functioning of the WUAs and these accounts thereafter.\nb. Rehabilitation of Irrigation Systems\n67. ONPD  will  reconfirm  the  list  of  subprojects  to  be  covered  under  each  batch  in\nconsultation with PAFSOs and DAFSOs. Detailed surveys will be undertaken by PIS for each\nsystem and detailed designs for rehabilitation will be prepared in consultation with PAFSOs. The\nengineering designs will be submitted to the SSDC for review and approval. Upon approval,\ncost estimates will be prepared by PAFSO. An initial environmental examination (IEE) will be\nundertaken  for  each  subproject  by  the  concerned  PAFSO.  The  IEEs  will  be  prepared  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  and\nEnvironmental Review Procedures and Procedures for Environmental Impact Assessment\nprepared by DOI with ADB assistance under SRIDP. If necessary, an environmental impact\nassessment  report  will  be  prepared.  Measures  to  mitigate  any  adverse  impact  will  be\nincorporated in the design for rehabilitation. The proposals will then be submitted to ONPD for\napproval. The planning, design, and implementation of the rehabilitation works will be carried\nout in close consultation with WUAs.", "20\nc. Subproject Selection Criteria\n68. NPD will approve the rehabilitation of irrigation systems provided that (i) the feasibility\nreport establishes that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of each subproject is not less\nthan 12 percent, (ii) there is no adverse environmental impact, (iii) at least one third of the\nbeneficiaries  are  presently  below  the  poverty  line,  (iv)  a  WUA  has  been  established  in\naccordance with the regulation on WUAs and a transfer agreement has been executed between\nthe WUA and PAFSO concerned, (v) the costs of rehabilitation do not exceed $1,200 per ha,\nand (vi) any expansion designed is within the installed pumping capacity and no additional\ncapacity  is  being  created.  NPD  will  obtain  ADB  approval  if  the  rehabilitation  cost  of  any\nsubproject exceeds $1.0 million. ONPD will furnish ADB with the list of approved subprojects\nsemiannually.\nd. Enhancement of Extension Capacity\n69. Implementation of this component is to be coordinated with DOA. The senior extension\ncoordinator will be responsible for national coordination of extension and training activities. A\ndeputy project manager from the provincial agriculture office will undertake these responsibilities\nat the provincial level. Though financed on a parallel basis as a grant by AFD, the consultants\nunder this component will be recruited to fit into the implementation schedule. They will work\nunder the overall supervision of the NPD and the team leader recruited under the ADB-financed\nconsulting service package.21 ONPD will also be responsible for  (i) coordinating and monitoring\nthe training activities of the MTs; (ii) preparing an overall training plan for the three-year training\nprogram of P-ETUs and FSEWs; (iii) preparing a general plan for extension activities for use of\nMTs in training the P-ETUs; and (iv) collecting, producing, replicating and distributing training\nmaterials.  Items (ii) and (iii) will be approved by MAF and the plan submitted to ADB. PAFSOs\nwill take steps to implement the extension activities in the selected districts in consultation with\nDAFSOs. The materials for training farmers will be provided in accordance with the training\nprogram to be developed by each PAFSO. Similarly, PAFSO and DAFSO staff will be trained in\nconsultation with the Department of Extension in MAF.\n3. Implementation Schedule\n70. The Project will be implemented over six years commencing in 2001. The subprojects\nwill be selected in three batches. For each batch of subprojects, there will be a first phase\n(1 year) of preparation; a second phase (1 year) of rehabilitation; and a third phase (two years)\nof extension, training and monitoring, and technical support to ensure that the system has\nstabilized.  The  implementation  of  the  different  activities  of  beneficiary  mobilization,\nrehabilitation, transfer, and service support is indicated in Appendix 7.\n4. Procurement\n71. Goods and services to be procured with ADB financing will be packaged, procured, and\nawarded in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The plans for civil works will be\nprepared with the assistance of ADB-financed consultants in accordance with the needs of each\nsubproject. In view of the number and scattered location of most civil works for rehabilitating\nirrigation  schemes,  it  is  proposed  that  local  competitive  bidding  be  undertaken  among\nprequalified contractors in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to ADB for a\n                                                          \n21  Specific understanding on the deployment and working of AFD-financed consultants has been reached in the\nMOU to be concluded by AFD and ADB on parallel cofinancing arrangement.", "21\ncontract estimated to cost less than $1.0 million equivalent. For contracts costing over $1.0\nmillion,  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  as  per  ADB  guidelines  will  be\nfollowed after prequalification of contractors.\n72. ONPD will procure equipment and vehicles using ICB procedures for packages over\n$500,000, international shopping procedures for packages costing $500,000 and less, and\ndirect purchase for those costing less than $100,000. The NPD will have overall responsibility\nfor carrying out procurement.\n5. Consulting Services\n73. A  total  of  167  person-months  of  international  and  224  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting services will support project implementation. The services will be in two packages. In\none package, ADB will finance the services of 85 person-months of international and 84 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services, for which an international firm will be recruited as per\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for engaging domestic\nconsultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  AFD  will  finance  the  remaining  82  person-months  of\ninternational and 140 person-months of domestic consultants. The AFD consultants will be\nrecruited through a separate package as per AFD\u2019s procedures, but their mobilization will be\ncoordinated with the team leader. The consultants will work closely with ONPD and DOI. The\nterms of reference of the consultants are attached as Appendix 8.\n6. Advance Procurement Action\n74. To expedite project implementation, ADB approved the Government request for advance\naction to cover procurement of goods and services, including vehicles and equipment, and\nengagement of consultants. The selection is expected to advance up to the stage of evaluation\nof the technical proposals. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action\ndoes not in any way commit ADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or the\nProject itself.\n7. Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n75. The NPD and the managers of the PPOs will establish and maintain accounts and records\nin such a manner as to facilitate identification of income and expenditures related for each\nsubproject. They will be assisted by an adequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff,\nincluding a financial manager within ONPD. All accounts and statements of expenditure and\nrevenues for each subproject will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. Audited\nproject accounts and financial statements and subproject accounts, together with the report of the\nauditor, will be submitted to ADB within 12 months of the close of the financial year. For this\nexercise, the PPOs will provide all necessary data that ONPD will consolidate and process.\n76. MAF will provide ADB and AFD with brief monthly progress reports prepared by ONPD.\nThe  reports  will  include  information  on  implementation  status,  current  problems,  proposed\nremedial actions, etc. as well as institutional and policy development aspects of the Project. More\ndetailed semiannual progress reports, also to be submitted to ADB and AFD, will provide specific\ninformation about the substantial physical completion of subprojects during the preceding half\nyear including details of implementation, costs, BME activities, and other information reasonably\nrequested by ADB. Within three months after physical completion of the Project, MAF will submit\nto ADB and AFD a completion report with detailed information on the above matters and include", "22\ninformation on the performance by the Government of its obligations, and an evaluation of\nbenefits.\n77. MOF  will  establish  an  imprest  account  with  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  after  loan\neffectiveness. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used for reimbursing\neligible expenditures and liquidating advances covered in the imprest account, in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and the detailed arrangements agreed upon by ADB\nand the Government. The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account will not be\nmore than the equivalent of $200,000 and any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated\nunder the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. Funding arrangements\nbetween MOF, MAF, and PAFSO will be covered in respective agreements to be reached for\nthis purpose with each province. MAF will be responsible for all administrative and accounting\nrequirements relating to the operation and utilization of such accounts.\n8. Midterm Review\n78. A comprehensive midterm review, based on BME findings, will be undertaken jointly by\nthe Government, ADB, and AFD at the end of the third year of implementation. The review will\ninclude  an  assessment  of  (i)  Project  progress,  including  plans  and  designs,  beneficiary\nparticipation, physical works, quality of rehabilitation, and possibility for modifying the project\nscope; (ii) future implementation plans and targets; (iii) project costs, counterpart funding, and\nallocation  of  funds  among  loan  categories;  (iv)  project  management  structure  and\nimplementation arrangements including the consulting services and any need for modification;\n(v)  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  role  of  the  private  sector;\n(vi) environmental, social, economic, and technical aspects of the Project; (vii) adequacy of the\nrehabilitation budget allocation by DOI; and (viii) compliance with loan covenants and reporting\nrequirements. Based on the midterm review, the project design will be revised, if necessary, to\nimprove implementation\n9. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n79. Prior to the commencement of the Community-Managed Irrigation Project (footnote 5),\nselected staff of SSDC attended a six-week training in BME. The course was also attended by\nselected  staff  members  of  PAFSOs  from  provinces  participating  in  that  project,  including\nBorikhamxai and Vientiane. Refresher training in BME will be provided for ONPD and PAFSO\nstaff members of the provinces of Savannakhet, Louang Phrabang and Sayaburi, and Vientiane\nMunicipality. This training is essential if the BME activities of the Project are to be effectively\nundertaken.\n80. Within nine months of loan effectiveness, MAF, with the support of consultants, will\nestablish appropriate mechanisms and procedures for BME. PAFSOs will carry out BME of\nsubprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook of BME (1992). The initial social, economic,\nand environmental surveys at the time of subproject appraisal will provide benchmark data and\ninformation for subsequent BME activities. The NPD, with the assistance of the implementation\nconsultants, will integrate BME of subprojects into that of the overall Project. Project benefits will\nbe closely monitored and compared with performance targets set out in the project framework.\nBME findings will be examined and analyzed by the NPD and reported in semiannual progress\nreports. The results will be fed back to PAFSOs and DAFSOs in participating provinces and\ndistricts, as well as to WUAs in the subprojects. Semiannual progress reports will be finalized and\nsubmitted to ADB, AFD, and project steering committee before the end of January and July each\nyear.", "23\nF. The Executing Agency\n81. MAF,  which  has  acquired  considerable  experience  with  projects  funded  by  the\nGovernment and external sources, will be the Executing Agency for the Project. It has been\nreorganized to provide technical services by specialized departments such as DOI and DOA\nand, at the same time, is capable of adequate coordination of different activities at the central\nand provincial levels. DOI\u2019s mandate covers all aspects of irrigation development. Its main\nfunctions  are  (i)  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  irrigation  schemes;  (ii)  providing\nbackstopping and technical assistance for O&M of the completed irrigation systems; and (iii)\nflood protection, including construction and maintenance of flood control embankments and\ndikes. DOI is headed by a Director General. Similarly DOA, which is also headed by a Director\nGeneral, has responsibility for agricultural inputs, crop diversification and extension. At the\nprovincial level, a senior irrigation engineer is part of PAFSO. The capacity of MAF, DOI, DOA,\nSSDC and PAFSOs has been assessed. The concerned staff will be provided relevant training\nto successfully implement the Project.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n82. The Government policy for agriculture stresses the importance of the irrigation subsector\nas a means to achieve food self-sufficiency through improved production. Emphasis now is on\nthe  need  for  farmer  and  community  participation  in  operating  irrigation  schemes.  Most\nimportantly,  the  Government  policy  is  also  focusing  on  improved  water  management,  the\nsustainability of irrigated agriculture systems, and, related to the latter, curbing and reversing\nthe  trend  of  watershed  (catchment)  degradation  through  a  gradual  phasing  out  of  the\nnonsustainable slash-and-burn practice on hill slopes. Current practices in small and medium-\nscale irrigation are characterized, in general, by two constraints that could eventually undermine\nthe environmental (and socioeconomic) sustainability of the scheme. These are (i) irrational use\nof  irrigation  water,  overirrigation,  inadequate  disposal  of  drainage  water,  etc.;  and\n(ii) degradation of the protective vegetative cover in catchment areas, leading to increased\nsediment load, destructive flash floods in the monsoon season, and water shortage during the\ndry season.\n83. Sustainable irrigation development will have three main positive effects: (i) improvement\nin nutritional status, health and income of the farming communities involved; (ii) elimination of\nnonsustainable, destructive, and exhaustive forms of slash-and-burn practices in the hills, with\ntheir negative environmental impacts such as soil erosion, landslides, flooding, biodiversity\nlosses, etc.; and (iii) improved irrigation water management\u2014regular cleaning of canals, and\navoidance of overirrigation, pooling, and waterlogging\u2014that will reduce the breeding areas for\nwater-related human disease vectors such as mosquitoes and rats and will have a positive\neffect  on  human  health.  Thus,  successful  project  implementation  will  entail  more  rational\nmanagement of irrigation water, with due attention given to the sustainability of the water\nresource, i.e., the catchment condition that dictates, to a large extent, the quantity and quality of\navailable irrigation water. Expansion of dry season irrigation and improved access to markets\ncan also induce farmers to grow less water-demanding crops, including cash crops.\n84. While no adverse environmental impact is expected at any subproject site, subproject\nselection criteria include a condition that the selected subprojects should have no negative", "24\neffects on the environment.22 Under SRIDP, based on ADB environmental requirements, a\nchecklist of environmental issues related to irrigation development was prepared for DOI. These\ncriteria will be applied to all subprojects. The summary IEE undertaken for two pilot subprojects\nis available on file. No specific adverse impact requiring any mitigation measures is expected.\n2. Social Dimensions\n85. As the Project will rehabilitate existing irrigation systems, the primary beneficiaries will\nbe farmers and farm families who have used irrigation infrastructure for some time. While most\nof them are not among the \u201cpoorest of the poor,\u201d a sizable number still fall below the poverty\nline.  The  underemployed  and  landless  labor  within  the  village  will  also  benefit  from  the\nadditional  employment  generated  by  more  intensive  farming.  The  Project  will  substantially\nimprove water management and farming methods to provide increased areas of quality irrigation\nand higher and diversified crop yields. These measures will all have a significant positive impact\non national food self-sufficiency and the reduction of poverty.\n86. The Project will help establish or strengthen farmer organizations at all sites. These\norganizations will not only generate the immediate benefit of more effective and cost-efficient\nuse of land and water, but also provide farmers with improved means and ability to access\nservices of public and private sector agencies. They will help farmers get better access to credit,\nmodern  inputs,  marketing  opportunities,  extension  services,  and  also  ensure  their\nrepresentation at higher political level. Project beneficiaries will also acquire skills in agricultural\npractices, problem solving, project and financial management, and knowledge of general issues\nsuch as accountability of leadership, group formation, and commercial practices.\n3. Gender Analysis\n87. Women traditionally play a major role in managing irrigation, especially in the distribution\nsystem. They are involved in all aspects of rice production and are active as behind-the-scenes\ndecision makers in the home and in the operation of WUAs. A detailed analysis of the impact of\nWUAs reveals that there is a risk of women farmers missing out on the benefits of establishing\nWUAs as part of the IMT process. The only way of avoiding this risk is to encourage active\nparticipation of women farmers. A specific strategy will be adopted to increase women farmers\u2019\ninvolvement and carry out a systematic gender development training and integration program\ngeared to selection of women farmers for responsible positions in WUAs. About 20 percent of all\nposts are expected to be occupied by women. To ensure that women have adequate access to\ntraining and extension, the Government has agreed to increase the number of women extension\nworkers in the DAFSOs. The Lao Women\u2019s Union is expected to be closely involved to counter\nthe technical bias of PAFSO and DAFSO staff. To ensure that extension and training staff have\nfull understanding of the importance of gender issues, it has been agreed that these staff be\nadequately trained in these aspects.\n                                                          \n22  Article 13.5 of MAF Regulation No. 1149 on Full Transfer of Irrigation Systems states that WUAs have the duty to\nprotect the environment by minimizing the negative environmental impacts arising from their activities.", "25\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analyses\n88. Detailed financial and economic analyses of two core subprojects have determined the\nfeasibility of the Project. The analysis demonstrated that the Project is financially sustainable for\nthe farmers as well as economically viable for the country. More details are in Appendix 9.\n1. Quantifiable Benefits\n89. By the end of the Project, about 56 well-functioning and appropriately trained WUAs will\nhave  been  established  in  as  many  irrigation  schemes  covering  about  10,000  ha.  The\nparticipating farmers will also have received extension training to adopt modern and appropriate\ncrop production and marketing techniques to significantly improve productivity and incomes.\nThe IMT process will ensure that WUAs are financially self-sufficient and technically capable of\ncarrying  out  the  necessary  O&M  for  their  irrigation  systems  on  a  sustainable  basis.\nRehabilitation of each batch of proposed subprojects will be implemented over two years. During\nthe first year, WUAs will be established, farmers will be trained, and the extension program will\ncommence. In the second year, detailed design and rehabilitation works will be carried out in\nclose cooperation with the beneficiaries. It is assumed that benefits will begin to accrue in the last\nyear of the rehabilitation works. The quantified benefits from the IMT process will include (i) about\n10 percent increase in the irrigated area; (ii) 10-15 percent increase in cropping intensity; (iii) 50\nand 65 percent increase in the wet and dry season paddy yields, respectively; and (iv) adoption of\nhigh-value crops on about 20 percent of the cropped area.\n2. Nonquantified Benefits\n90. A wide range of nonquantified benefits will result from the Project. The improved and\nmore productive subprojects will contribute to national and local food security. Direct employment\nopportunities will increase as a result of more intensified farming and increased irrigated area.\nIndirect employment opportunities in marketing, processing of farm products and farm services\nwill also expand. Organizations of women\u2019s groups will gradually expand their role and influence\nin the decision-making process. The IMT process itself will strengthen the WUAs by making\nthem more sustainable in the long run. Other benefits that are not quantified but are significant will\nbe the reduced Government budget allocation for the O&M of irrigation schemes.\n3. Financial Analysis\n91. Farm  models  and  crop  budgets  were  generated  for  two  core  subprojects\u2014one  in\nNakhong and another in Chom Tong. Results indicate that annual paddy production would\nincrease by 650 metric tons (t), valued at around  $57,000. Of this increase, 200 t would be\nrequired for payments to VDF and ISF. If the current population at the two sites were to stay\nconstant at 580 families (3,500 people), annual paddy production per family would increase from\nabout 6.0 t to around 8.5 t, an increase of over 40 percent. The Project is also expected to\nincrease the production of other crops as well. Maize will increase by 120 t (valued at $12,500),\nand vegetables by 525 t with a value of over  $50,000. It is estimated that net farm income will\nincrease for farms of all sizes. Farm models for both sites were generated. The estimated\nhousehold cash flow in the with-Project scenario is shown in Appendix 9, Table A9.3. From the\nassumptions made in this study, the incremental impact on farm incomes will be significant. After\nproject implementation, the cash flow of farming households and the production base will improve;\nhence,  the  capacity  to  manage  risk  will  be  strengthened.  Farm  household  surpluses\u2014after", "26\npayment of IMT levies, VDF and ISF, and an allowance for continuing electricity price increases\u2014\nare well above the associated increases in production costs.\n92. The successful implementation of the Project will lead to the complete phasing out of\nsubsidies on O&M for the proposed 56 schemes and, to the extent the Project is replicated, for\nall irrigation schemes in the country. In the proposed financing approach, it is envisaged that\nfarmers will cover all costs of routine O&M and will build up a corpus to meet part of the costs of\nthe periodic replacement or repair of major capital items. Successful WUAs are expected to\nbecome eligible for medium- and long-term loans from public and private commercial banks that\nwould enable them to raise capital for replacing equipment and further improving and expanding\ntheir irrigation schemes. Farmer payments to the VDF will reduce claims on the Government\nbudget. As originally proposed by the Government, 20 percent of these payments would pass\nout of the village to the district development fund, and 80 percent would stay in the village and\nenable farmers to finance local initiatives, including expenses related to irrigation.\n4. Economic Analysis\n93. Economic analysis was carried out for the two core subprojects. The estimated EIRRs\nwere 22.6 for Nakhong and 24.0 percent for Chom Thong. The analysis includes the capital and\nsupport costs during the two-year implementation of individual subprojects and recurrent cost of\nO&M for the assumed 15-year life of the subprojects. The economic benefits were estimated in\nconstant 2000 prices and the world price numeraire was used. The economic farmgate prices of\ninternationally  traded  commodities  (rice,  maize,  and  soybean)  and  fertilizers  (urea  and\ndiammonium phosphate) were derived from the World Bank Commodity Price Projections (April\n2000) and adjusted for port handling, transportation, and processing costs. The economic price\nof crop seed was considered to be 20 percent higher than the respective commodity price.\n94. The sensitivity analysis suggests that a 20 percent decrease in agricultural benefits\n(yields) would reduce the EIRR to 17.3 in Nakhong and 18.7 percent in Chom Thong. Similarly,\na 20 percent increase in the rehabilitation (cash) costs would reduce the EIRR to 19.4 and 21.3,\nrespectively. A simultaneous 20 percent decrease in benefits and 20 percent increase in (cash)\ncosts would reduce the EIRR to 14.6 and 15.8 percent, respectively, for these subprojects.\n5. Sustainability\n95. Project sustainability will be contingent on the technical support provided and financial\nviability of farmers. The extent to which the Government is subsidizing the irrigation subsector is\nunclear. The budgetary situation in the Lao PDR imposes major limitations on the Government\u2019s\nsubsidy for O&M. Power is provided at a subsidized cost as part of the Government\u2019s normal\npricing policy, but a process is in place to continually increase its tariff to a market price. There\nare no subsidies on fertilizer or seed supply. The Government subsidizes the subsector to a\nlimited extent by providing ad hoc assistance for emergency and major repairs to irrigation\ninfrastructure, but the actual allocation for this assistance is difficult to determine. It appears\nthere are no significant distortions in the output or input markets. With improved irrigation sector\nefficiency and after IMT implementation, savings to the treasury can be expected. It may then\nbe possible to allocate more resources to technical supervision and extension service. Both will\nbe critical to the sustainability of the Project and IMT program.", "27\nB. Impact on Poverty\n96. The Project is aimed at farmers who make up over 90 percent of the rural poor \u2013 the\nestimated rural poverty line is KN83,000 ($11)/capita/month.23 Almost two thirds of all farming\nhouseholds can be classified as poor and the rural poor make up 87 percent of the country\u2019s total\npoor population. The proposed Project is expected to have a direct impact on approximately\n62,000 people in the project area.24 In many parts of the Lao PDR, rice is insufficient with\nshortages occurring for up to four months in a year. Households that suffer from rice shortages for\n2-3 months in a year are between 7 and 31 percent in provinces covered by the Project.\nIncreased rice yields will ensure that these shortages do not occur in the beneficiary households.\nThe impact will be particularly significant in the poorer households.\n97.  After the rehabilitation in many subprojects, it may be possible to expand the command\narea by about 10 percent. The beneficiaries of this expansion will mostly be poorer farmers in the\nvillage who have hitherto had no access to irrigation. Improved agricultural practices are also likely\nto generate additional farm employment, thus benefiting the landless in the villages.\n98.  In the two core subproject sites at Nakhong and Chom Thong, the average landholdings of\nthe below-average group of farmers, mostly in the group below the poverty line, are 0.7 ha (40\npercent) and 0.3 ha (40 percent), respectively. The figures in parentheses indicate the percentage\nof the total command area owned by this group. The farm models indicate that, after the Project,\nfarmers in this category would begin to generate cash surpluses even after deductions are made\nfor VDF and ISF: $200 in Nakhong and $35 in Chom Thong.25 Pre- and post-Project income\nlevels, based on farm models for average landholdings, are given in Appendix 9.\nC. Risks\n99. Three principal project risks pertain to (i) implementation, (ii) realization of benefits, and (iii)\nsustainability.  Crosscutting  concerns  for  all  three  categories  are  the  level  of  motivation  and\ncapacity of farmers, the implementation capacity and adequate number of Government staff, and\nadequacy of extension services.\n100. Project  implementation  will  be  affected  if  there  is  no  interest  on  the  part  of  the\nbeneficiaries. While the demonstration effect of SIRAP is expected to make the beneficiaries\nkeen to accept ownership of the assets, it also means that there are greater costs to bear for\nthem. The experience with respect to collecting O&M costs in the SIRAP subprojects has been\nencouraging. The advantages of the IMT process and expected gains must be adequately\nexplained and the beneficiaries educated and trained to become willing to participate in the\nprocess. Close monitoring, technical supervision, support through assured inputs supply, etc.,\nwould be necessary to build confidence. The extension support and specific institutional support\nfor the WUAs are to address these risks. Feasibility studies will be undertaken in all subprojects,\nwith the full participation of beneficiaries, to establish incentives for farmer participation during\nplanning, implementation, and routine O&M.\n                                                          \n23  This estimate of the rural poverty line is based on data from Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2 (1997).\nThese data were adjusted to March 2000 level by applying the Consumer Price Index that increased by about\n350 percent during this period. The average household has six people.\n24\nA typical beneficiary household will have six persons farming slightly more than 1 ha, of which little less than 1  ha\nmay be irrigated in the wet season, and rice and alternative cash crops may be irrigated in the dry season.\n25\nA significant portion of income for households in this category in Chom Thong area comes from off-farm\nemployment in Vientiane.", "28\n101. The institutional capacity of DOI, PAFSOs, and DAFSOs is an equally important risk.\nThe management capability of DOI and PAFSOs has been carefully assessed and the project\nscope  was  determined  on  that  basis.  Project  management  support  will  be  provided  for\nsubproject  appraisal,  design  development,  training  of  extension  staff,  and  BME.  The\nGovernment must ensure that adequate and trained staff, who have gained experience under\nFIAT and PEP, are appointed in the project area. While the Government has agreed to appoint\nmore women extension staff, past experience indicates that, for personal reasons, many women\nleave  after  being  trained.  To  the  extent  possible,  this  must  be  taken  into  account  in  the\nappointment of women staff.\n102. Some specific measures have been incorporated to mitigate implementation risk: (i) site\nselection will be determined by technical and social considerations; (ii) survey and design will be\nundertaken at provincial level where the capability exists, but SSDC staff will be permanently\nassigned  to  the  provinces  during  the  survey  and  design  process;  (iii)  DOI  has  developed\nstandards to be followed for survey, design, and construction; (iv) care will be taken in selecting\nprequalified contractors, with selection being based on known past performance; and (v) the\nteam  leader  of  the  project  management  team  will  be  party  to  all  decisions  on  contract\nmanagement, including matters on contractor disqualification and/or dismissal.\n103. Realizing the expected level of benefits is contingent on the Government being able to\nprovide an effective combination of policy environment, extension services, and timely and\nadequate supply of inputs. Budget support for nonsalary recurring costs for extension support is\nessential and needs to be maintained after project completion. The Government contribution\nthrough the budget to meet its share of project cost needs close monitoring. Market-determined\nprices are expected to result in higher returns to farmers. The Government needs to pursue the\nopening up of export markets. It must ensure availability of inputs and take steps to allow the\nprivate sector to supply inputs. The extension service is important to ensure that inputs are used\nefficiently. Productivity can only increase with better technology transfer relating to use of inputs.\nQuality of inputs like seeds needs to be improved. These are the specific areas in which\ninstitutional strengthening activities will be directed and technical assistance provided to WUAs\nto help develop market intelligence. The risk to expectations regarding export markets is the\npolicy environment in neighboring countries as well as comparative costs of production.\n104. Sustainability  of  the  IMT  process  and  efficient  agriculture  depend  primarily  on  the\nefficient functioning of the WUAs and their ability to maintain the irrigation systems, manage\nO&M funds, and provide marketing and service support. Ways and means of effectively forming\nWUAs and improving their technical and managerial capabilities have been explored during\nproject formulation and will be pursued during implementation.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n105. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Within three months after loan effectiveness, a PPMC will be established in each\nof the six provinces in the project area. The PPMC will be chaired by the vice-\ngovernor  of  the  province  and  will  comprise  the  head  of  PAFSO  and\nrepresentatives from the Service of Finance, LWU, and APB to coordinate the\nProject.", "29\n(ii)  Within three months after loan effectiveness, a PPO will be established in each of\nthe six provinces in the project area. The PPO will comprise representatives from\nthe Service of Planning, Agriculture, Agriculture Extension Agency, Livestock and\nFisheries  and  Forestry  (to  be  assigned  by  the  head  of  PAFSO).  An  IMT\ncoordinator from PIS will be attached to the PPO as provincial project manager\nand one person from the Service of Agriculture will be attached as a deputy\nmanager responsible for coordinating the extension and training activities.\n(iii) Within one year of loan effectiveness, MAF will have been reorganized and the\nstaff redeployed at the provincial and district levels, as recommended in the\nagriculture strategy.\n(iv) The  already  existing  P-ETUs  in  six  provinces  will  continue  during  project\nimplementation and remain as part of PAFSO following project completion. In\naddition, within three months after loan effectiveness, one additional person from\nthe PIS will be attached to the P-ETU in each province for the duration of the\nProject.\n(v) Within six months of loan effectiveness, ONPD will prepare a model transfer\nagreement,  acceptable  to  ADB,  specifying  the  responsibilities  of  DAFSO,\nPAFSO, and WUAs during the rehabilitation phase and subsequent operation of\nthe system.\n(vi) The WUA will levy an ISF to fully fund the costs incurred in routine O&M of the\nirrigation  system.  The  Government  will  guide  the  WUAs  in  determining  the\namount of ISF to be levied each year so that O&M costs are fully recovered.\n(vii) On  completion  of  the  rehabilitation  works,  WUAs  will  establish  a  separate\naccount for the funding of major repair or replacement of capital works such as\npumps, motors, electrical equipment, or major structures. This account will be\nfunded from a portion of VDF, the amount of which will not be less than 50\npercent of that portion of VDF that is to be retained by the Village Development\nCommittee. The amounts collected will be wholly managed by the WUAs and no\nportion will be passed to a higher level. WUAs will also be allowed to maintain\nthese amounts in a separate account with either the APB or any commercial\nbank, in either kip or other currencies as permitted by the Government.\n(viii) Within  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  a\ncomplete review of the VDF is undertaken and that consolidated guidelines are\nissued by MOF.\n(ix) A full review of the program for rehabilitating irrigation systems and adequacy of\nbudget allocation will be undertaken before the midterm review. The Government\nhas  assured  that,  starting  2001,  15  percent  of  the  DOI  budget  for  new\nconstruction  will  be  allocated  for  rehabilitation,  and  that  the  amount  will  be\nincreased progressively each year to reach 30 percent by 31 December 2006.\nThe adequacy of such adjustment will be discussed with ADB during the midterm\nreview.", "30\n(x) Subproject selection criteria as agreed upon by the Government and ADB and\ntaking  into  account  various  social  issues  including  poverty  reduction  will  be\nadopted and applied objectively to select the subprojects in 17 districts of the six\nprovinces of the project area. All subprojects will have been selected before the\nmidterm review.\n(xi) Staff trained as MTs by FIAT and PEP projects will be available in the project\narea  as  Government-employed  counterparts  in  participating  PAFSOs  and\nDAFSOs during project implementation. In addition, during the survey and design\nstage, SSDC staff undertaking the task will be permanently assigned to the\nprovinces in the project area.\n(xii) ONPD will be responsible for preparing (i) an overall plan for the three-year\ntraining program of the P-ETU and FSEWs, and (ii) a general plan for extension\nactivities for MTs use in training the P-ETU. These plans are to be approved by\nMAF and will be submitted to ADB within 12 months after loan effectiveness.\n(xiii) The  Government  will  endeavor  to  direct  project  intervention  activities  to\nencourage participation of women farmers in the IMT process. For this purpose,\nspecific provision will be made for women farmers to be registered members of\nWUAs  and  to  be  appointed  in  decision-making  positions  on  committees\nassociated with irrigated agriculture, agriculture extension, and VDF. At least 20\npercent of such positions will be filled by women.\nB. Condition of Loan Effectiveness\n106. In addition to the standard conditions of loan effectiveness, the Government will have\nobtained the AFD financing on terms satisfactory to ADB and will have provided ADB with a\ncopy of the signed agreement with AFD.\nVII.      RECOMMENDATION\n107. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  11,942,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the\nDecentralized Irrigation Development and Management Sector Project, with a term of 32 years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and\nconditions as are substantially in

The incidence of poverty in the country was, for the first time, comprehensively reported in\n1995  on  the  basis  of  data  collected  in  1992/93.  The  first  Lao  Household  Expenditure  and\nConsumption Survey (LECS 1), conducted by the Lao National Statistical Centre, identified income\nand spending levels for 3,000 households across the country. The data were combined with the\noutcomes of the Lao Social Indicators Survey (LSIS) of 1993 and analyzed in the 1995 World Bank\nReport, Lao PDR Social Development Assessment and Strategy. As a first step in determining\npoverty, two poverty lines were identified (Table A2.1).\nTable A2.1: Poverty Lines, by Region and Sector, Lao PDR, 1992/93\n(KN per capita per month)\nMean Consumption\nRegion Food Poverty Line Poverty Line Expenditure\nRural Urban Average Rural Urban Average Rural Urban Average\nNorth 7,045   7,045 7,045   9,299   9,299   9,299 10,285 16,448 11,347\nCenter 8,990 10,449 9,436 12,047 13,782 12,577 14,520 23,335 17,214\nSouth 8,860   8,860 8,860 12,289 12,289 12,289 12,504 21,762 14,696\nAll 8,288   9,431 8,558 11,145 12,526 11,472 12,504 21,862 14,696\nSource: World Bank, 1995.\nThe Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS 2) was carried out in 1997/98, and based on\nthe preliminary data, the comparable situation is shown in Table A2.2.\nTable A2.2: Poverty Lines, by Region and Sector, Lao PDR, 1997/98\n(KN per capita per month)\nMean Consumption\nRegion Food Poverty Line High Poverty Line Expenditure\nRural Urban Average Rural Urban Average Rural Urban Average\nNorth 15,958 15,861 15,949 18,318 18,211 18,307 21,976 35,876 23,336\nCenter 17,159 18,200 17,410 18,318 18,211 19,358 29,186 52,059 34,691\nSouth 16,364 16,364 16,417 18,056 17,983 18,049 23,456 37,443 24,818\nAll 16,588 17,552 16,749 18,597 19,597 18,764 25,475 47,351 29,126\nSource: National Statistical Centre, Poverty Analysis Report, 2000.

This makes it necessary to adjust the poverty line figures to arrive at an amount that\nreflects the current cost of purchasing 2,100 calories per person per day. No up-to-date rural and\nurban poverty line figures are available, so the best possible estimate can be made only by\nadjusting available for inflation the figures for the food poverty line. The most recent poverty line\ndata available are the ones from LECS 2. They are derived from data collected between March\n1997 and March 1998, and the final figures reflect the changing prices over 12 months.\n3. The prevalence and depth of poverty were calculated in the context of data from LECS 1\nand LECS 2. The prevalence of the different types or degrees of poverty was measured by the\nhead count ratio: the percentage of individuals whose household expenditures fall under the\npoverty line. Depth of poverty relates to the extent income falls under the poverty line. This is the\n                                                \n1  The data used is based on Government and World Bank documents. ADB\u2019s own analysis of poverty levels is being\nfinalized.

Changes in the incidence of poverty over the five-year interval reported by the two LECS\nexercises are summarized in Tables A2.3 and A2.4. To allow proper comparison, LECS 1 data\nwere adjusted to reflect the same food item basket as that used in LECS 2.\nTable A2.3:  Incidence of Poverty by Region and Sector, Lao PDR, 1992/93\nPercentage Below Percentage Below\nRegion High Poverty Line Low Poverty Line\nRural Urban Average Rural Urban Average\nNorth 61.5 19.8 54.3 48.4 10.4 41.8\nCenter 44.4 18.6 36.6 28.3 8.3 22.2\nSouth 56.6 10.8 48.8 38.4 5.5 32.8\nAll 52.9 17.8 44.6 37.4 8.4 30.5\n Source: National Statistical Centre, Poverty Analysis Report, 2000.

This means that in 1992/93, 44.6 percent of the national population fell below the higher\npoverty line, while 30.5 percent came under the food poverty line (i.e., they were not able to obtain\nthe minimally required nutrition). There has been limited progress since, as the figures are 39\npercent (for the high poverty line) and virtually the same for the low or food poverty line, at 30.6\npercent in 1997/98. In other words, there has been some improvement in overall poverty, but\nextreme poverty has not changed. The tables show that poverty was, and still is, much more\ncommon in rural areas than in urban areas. The rural population under the high poverty line was 53\npercent in 1992/93, and almost 44 percent in 1997/98. The rural population below the poverty line\nwas 37.4 percent in 1992/93 and 34.4 percent in 1997/98. It is clear that the extent and depth of\npoverty differ from region to region.\n6. The poverty gap figures for the two intervals show very little progress (Tables A2.5 and\nA2.6). The shortfall between the actual income (in cash and kind) and the level needed to be at the\nhigh or low poverty line have not changed much. This shortfall may be lower than in many other\ncountries; it does not decrease quickly and even increases for most urban poor.", "40\nAppendix 2, page 3\nTable A2.5: Poverty Gap in 1992/93 and 1997/98 \u2013 High Poverty Line\nRegion Rural Areas Urban Areas Region\n1992/93 1997/98 1992/93 1997/98 1992/93 1997/198\nNorth 18.7 17.5 4.2 5.4 16.2 16.3\nCenter 11.2 8.8 3.6 2.5 8.9 7.3\nSouth 16.8 10.8 2.1 6.7 14.3 10.4\nAll 15.0 12.2 3.5 3.5 12.3 10.8\nSource: National Statistical Centre, Poverty Analysis Report, 2000.

The main conclusions at this point are as follows:\n(i)  Poverty in the Lao PDR continues to be severe and to be widespread.\n(ii)  Although rural poverty has been reduced more significantly than urban poverty, rural\npoverty is still high.\n(iii)  The  distribution  of  poverty  over  the  provinces  is  uneven,  with  some  provinces\nhaving more than three times the percentage of poor than some others.\n9. If the proposed Project is to have substantial impact on the reduction of poverty, it has to\nprovide  an  adequate  response  to  the  observed  socioeconomic  realities  of  the  villages  and\nhouseholds. It has to focus on those constraints that cause or perpetuate poverty. The most\nimportant recommendations with regard to giving due attention to the poverty dimension in design,\norganization, and execution of the envisaged program are the following:\n(i)  The Project should focus on villages that have a substantial number of households\nbelow the poverty line. Including all irrigation systems in a district or province would\nnot  give  due  importance  to  poverty-related  issues.  Project  villages  should  be\nselected on the basis of estimated portions of households below the poverty line.\n(ii)  As access to land is relatively evenly distributed, the thrust of the program may be\ndirected to entire irrigation systems and agricultural production systems. The social\nand  economic  realities  of  the  villages  in  the  project  areas  do  not  show  such\npervasive  or  profound  distinctions  in  wealth,  income,  status,  or  access  that\ninterventions can or should be targeted primarily at any strictly defined category.\n(iii)  The  focus  of  the  Project  should  be  on  improving  agricultural  productivity  and\nintensity, while ensuring that land distribution does not become less egalitarian than\nit presently seems to be.\n(iv)  Improvements in agricultural productivity have proven to be feasible and to draw\nfarmers  interest.  Most  villages  in  the  proposed  project  areas  meet  the  basic\nrequirements for such improvements in electricity, road access, local or nearby\nmarkets,  basic  educational  facilities,  water  users  organizations  (though\nrudimentary), and sufficient availability of land and water.\n(v)  While most of these constraining factors affect all socioeconomic categories, some\naffect  the  poorer  household  more  strongly.  It  will  be  important  to  take  such\ndifferentiation  into  account  in  the  design  and  organization  of  the  program,\nparticularly with regard to training (as the poor have less education), technology\n(poor farms are less mechanized and farmers have less experience with credit), and\norganization of water users association (WUAs) (the poor may be less articulate in\npresenting their demands).\n(vi)  The poverty aspect can also be taken into account when it is technically feasible to\nexpand the area under irrigation: preference may be given to land-poor households,\nbut this is an issue to be decided with the community.\n(vii)  There are few other possible approaches for increasing rural wealth that would\nreach so many households and that are likely to have a reasonably equitable effect.\n(viii)  The Project, apart from improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the available\nirrigation  infrastructure,  should  target  the  other  most  constraining  factors:\ninadequate use of modern inputs, limited knowledge of new technologies among\nmale and female farmers, low degree of participation in the market, underutilization\nof  irrigated  land,  and  lack  of  incentives  to  intensify  and  diversify  agricultural\nproduction.", "42\nAppendix 2, page 5\n(ix)  The present involvement of women should be maintained and strengthened, and\nspecial attention is warranted to ensure that modernization and formalization of\n(irrigated) agriculture do not sideline women. This requires a deliberate and carefully\nplanned approach to the aspect of gender.\n(x)  The use of modern inputs, especially efficient irrigation, requires more and more\neffective cooperation among farmers than has been the case in traditional farming.\nModern farming, with its much greater reliance on external input supply, services\nand markets, also requires much more active and purposeful involvement of farmers\nwith regard to external suppliers, service providers, and buyers. There is need to\ndevelop more effective forms of cooperation among farmers and to increase their\nindividual and collective leverage.", "43\nAppendix 3, page 1\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR\nA.

Significant Projects in the Pipeline\n1. World Bank\n1. The World Bank has included an agricultural development project for FY2001 in their\nongoing country assistance strategy. Activities are expected to include the rehabilitation of\ngravity irrigation systems, establishment of water users associations (WUAs), and capacity\nenhancement  of  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  service  offices  (PAFSOs)  and  district\nagriculture and forestry service offices (DAFSOs). It is also expected to include essential rural\ninfrastructure development. In consultation with ADB, it was proposed that this project operate\nin the provinces of Khammouan, Saravane, Champassak, and Attapeu.\n2. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)\n2. JICA is presently exploring possible assistance in designing a project to support the\nagriculture sector in the Mekong Basin. This project is expected to cover the provinces of\nBorikhamxai, Khammouan, and Savannakhet. At present, the team in the field is collecting data,\nbut it is understood that the proposed project will undertake capacity-building activities with\nPAFSOs, and DAFSOs.\n3. Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC)\n3. SDC funded the Pilot Extension Project that operated in the provinces of Saravane and\nChampassak from 1996 to 1999. It is understood that SDC is interested in providing continued\nfunding for similar activities in the future.", "46\nAppendix 4, page 1\nSUBPROJECT SELECTION PROCEDURES\nA. Introduction\n1. In  the  course  of  the  feasibility  study,  it  was  agreed  that  the  Project  would  cover\nprovinces with a minimum of 2,000 hectares (ha) of irrigated area in the dry season. On this\nbasis and in consultation with the Government, it was decided that the Project would cover the\nfollowing provinces: (i) Borikhamxai, (ii) Savannakhet, (iii) Vientiane Municipality, (iv) Vientiane\nProvince, (v) Louang Phrabang, and (vi) Sayaburi.\n2. It was recognized that a significant package of institutional and training support would be\nrequired to achieve the project objectives. It was also recognized that human resources in each\nof the provinces were limited. Further, it was considered necessary to take into account the\nnumber of potential subproject sites in each province to allow limited human resources to be\ndeployed efficiently. The proposed investment in institutional strengthening and human resource\ndevelopment  at  the  district  level  was  intended  to  have  maximum  impact.  On  this  basis,\n17 districts were identified in these provinces.1\nB. Screening Criteria\n3. For any individual subproject site to be selected, its system must have a minimum irrigated\narea of 200 ha in the wet season, or 50 in the dry season. Importance was then placed on social\naspects, in particular poverty reduction in selecting the subprojects.\n4. All sites initially suggested as potential subprojects were carefully screened for social\nconcerns.  As a first step, the following criteria that considered social factors, gender, and\nviability of the transfer process were developed: (i) poverty level in villages, (ii) community\ncapability, (iii) interest and capacity for irrigation management transfer, (iv) gender aspects, (v)\nsupportive context, (vi) secure access to water and land, (vii) agronomic aspects, and (viii)\navailability of infrastructure.\n5. An in-depth survey of all initially selected schemes was then organized to determine to\nwhat extent they meet the various criteria. The survey was carried out by experienced project\nstaff of Farmer Irrigated Agriculture Training Project familiar with local conditions, in close\nconsultation with the concerned provincial agriculture and forestry service offices (PAFSOs) and\ndistrict agriculture and forestry service offices. The survey was designed to estimate the income\nof beneficiary households. It was decided not only to rely on estimated household incomes but\nalso  to  use  a  number  of  indicators  of  wealth  and  income.  It  was  recognized  that  the\nsocioeconomic  well-being  of  households  and  villages  is  not  only  expressed  in  household\nincome, but also reflected size and nature of landholdings, quantity of rice produced, household\npossessions (like radio, motorbike, TV, refrigerator), and availability of infrastructure facilities in\nthe village (like health post, secondary school, all-weather road). In the final selection, the\npattern of socioeconomic indicators was considered: sites that scored consistently high on the\nvarious indicators (i.e., appearing to be consistently better off than other sites in the survey)\nwere excluded and sites that appeared to be consistently poorer were included. The screening\n                                                \n1  The  17  districts  selected  are:  Pakkading,  Pakxan,  and  Thaphabat  in  Borikhamxai;  Champon,  Xaibouri,\nSaypouthong, and Songkhon in Savannakhet; Hatsaifong, Pakngum, Saythani, and Sikhottabong in Vientiane\nMunicipality; Keoudom, Phonhong, Thoulakhom, and Viengkham in Vientiane Province; Louang Phrabang in\nLouang Phrabang; and Phiang in Sayaburi.", "47\nAppendix 4, page 2\nprocess helped to identify the subprojects that would benefit a significant number of poorer\nfarmers.\n6. The national project director (NPD) will approve a selected subproject provided (i) the\nfeasibility report establishes that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the subproject is\nnot less than 10 percent, (ii) there is no adverse environmental impact, (iii) at least one third of the\nbeneficiaries are presently below the poverty threshold, (iv) a water user association (WUA) has\nbeen  established  in  accordance  with  Department  of  Irrigation  guidelines  and  an  agreement\nexecuted between the WUA and PAFSO concerned, (v) the costs of rehabilitation do not exceed\n$1,200/ha, and (vi) any expansion designed is within the installed capacity of the pumps at\npresent and no additional installed capacity is being created. The NPD will seek approval by the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) if the rehabilitation cost of any subproject exceeds $1.0 million.\nONPD will submit the list of approvals to ADB semiannually.\nC. Conclusion\n7. Using the above procedures, 156 subproject sites, which generally met technical criteria in\nterms of size, were assessed and 56 subprojects were recommended.", "  COST ESTIMATES\nTable A5.1:  Expenditure Accounts, by Financier\n($'000)\nFarmer Local\nAsian Development Agence Francaise Contribution in The Government Currency\nBank de Developpement Labor and Kind of Lao PDR Total Foreign (Excl.

Introduction\n1. Over 500 pump irrigation schemes built since the late 1970s now function with varying\ndegrees of efficiency. Most have a command area of 80-300 hectares (ha). Initially, many had\ndiesel pumps due to the poor rural power distribution system. However, a great majority of them\nnow  have  electric  pumps.  In  addition  to  these  schemes,  over  200  new  schemes  were\nestablished after 1996 under the National Irrigation Management Program (NIMP) and pumps at\nseveral of the old schemes were replaced. Invariably, most of the schemes are in the Mekong\nRiver plains and do not have an efficient water distribution system. For their operation and\nmaintenance (O&M), the Government bears a heavy fiscal burden. Under the Dutch-funded\nSustainable Irrigated Agriculture Project (SIRAP) completed in 1998, the concept of irrigation\nmanagement  transfer  (IMT)  was  pilot-tested  in  eight  such  schemes  by  establishing  well-\nfunctioning water users associations (WUAs). The SIRAP experience demonstrated that well-\ntrained WUAs can take over such schemes from the Government and provide for their O&M on\na sustainable basis. Under the proposed Project, IMT will result in significant fiscal savings for\nthe Government while the efficiency of the schemes will help increase farm productivity and\nincomes of the beneficiaries.\n2. To determine the financial and economic feasibility of this Project, two subprojects were\nselected for detailed analysis, i.e., Nakhong in Vientiane Province and Chom Thong in Vientiane\nMunicipality. Both subprojects are representative of the majority of the schemes. Paddy is the\nmain crop in both the wet and dry season. Soybean, maize, and vegetables are other crops in\nthis area. Due to its proximity to Vientiane, Chom Thong has a larger more area for vegetables\nthan for the two other crops.\n3. The  main  source  of  farm  data  is  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)\nreport.1 The report contains detailed information on farm production, input and output markets,\nagricultural support services, and subproject development costs collected from the two sites and\nthe  concerned  line  agencies.  The  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  subprojects  was\nassessed separately to determine the overall feasibility of the Project.\n1. Price, Cost, and Other Assumptions\n4. During the preparation of the TA report (March 2000), the prevailing exchange rate was\nKN7,600. The same exchange rate was used in this analysis.\n5. The analysis used the world price numeraire. The economic benefits were estimated in\nconstant 2000 prices. The economic farmgate prices of internationally traded commodities, i.e.,\nrice, maize, soybean, urea, and phosphorus, were derived from the World Bank Commodity\nPrice Projections (April 2000) and adjusted for port handling in Bangkok, transportation to\nsubprojects  via  Vientiane,  and  processing  costs.  The  economic  price  of  crop  seed  was\n20 percent higher than the respective commodity prices. Local output and input prices were\nbased on the FY2000 prices adjusted to economic values using a standard conversion factor of\n0.90. The shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) was assessed at 77 percent of the agricultural daily\nhired labor rate. The SWRF was used only to estimate the contribution of family labor in the off-\npeak operations and to convert the financial labor costs to economic costs. The cost of family or\n                                                \n1 TA 3189-LAO: Irrigation Management Transfer Project, for $650,000, approved on 27 April 1999. Final Report\nsubmitted on 4 April 2000.", "61\nAppendix 9, page 2\nhired labor employed during the peak seasons, i.e., transplanting and harvesting, was not\nadjusted to SWRF as there was no evidence of excess labor at those times.\n6. To date, all expenditures on these schemes were regarded as sunk costs. On average, it\nwas assumed that rehabilitation would increase the irrigated area by 10 percent at each site.\nLife of the rehabilitated subproject was assumed to be 15 years. Without rehabilitation, there\nwould be a slow winding down in dry season production within the system. This was assumed to\nbe 90 percent, 80 percent, and 70 percent of the present area in years 1-5, 6-10, and 11-15,\nrespectively. Extension and WUA development support would be provided in full from Project\nstart-up for five years. Support for marketing development and financial services would be\nprovided for three years through a grant from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de Developpement (AFD).\nTotal subproject costs, including the cost of the TA, were spread uniformly over the total area\ncovered by the Project. Cost estimates were tentative, based on initial survey work and current\nunit costs. Cost of system rehabilitation would vary from site to site, according to conditions, i.e.,\n$600/ha at Nakhong and $1,000/ha at Chom Thong. Another 20 percent cost would be borne by\nfarmers in labor and kind.\n7. In the first year of the Project, WUAs would be established and trained, and the detailed\nengineering design prepared. In the second year, rehabilitation would be carried out while the\nextension training would be further strengthened. Although there would be some impact on\nincreased input use and higher crop yields due to extension training during the first two years,\nthe  full  benefits  from  the  Project  are  assumed  from  year  3.  Crop  yield  projections  are\nconservative and based on the realistic potential of individual crops using improved agronomic\ntechniques. Incremental irrigation service fee (ISF) for O&M would be phased in after year 3.\nThe village development fund (VDF) would be levied from the transfer of the system at the end\nof year 2. The power tariff would continue to increase from the current KN71($0.01)/kilowatt-\nhour (kWh) until the scheduled escalation is reached, i.e., KN160 ($0.02)/kWh, by December\n2001.\n2. Subsidies and Tariffs\n8. Farmers receive some subsidies, particularly for power, agricultural credit, and for O&M of\nthe schemes. In addition, fertilizers are subsidized, but to a lesser extent. The power subsidy,\nbased on estimates of production and distribution costs of $0.045/kWh and the current tariff for\nirrigation of $0.0114/kWh, amounts to about 75 percent, but is being progressively reduced.2 This\nis currently worth about $30 per typical farmer per year, and agriculture\u2019s share is less than\n6 percent of the total power consumed in the country.\n9. The difference between Agricultural Promotion Bank\u2019s (APB) short-term interest rates for\nlending on Government-sponsored projects and those for APB nonsponsored lending or from\ncommercial banks is around 10 percent per annum. This is regarded as a subsidy to farmers and\nwould typically be worth about $7 per farmer per season. Irrigation scheme maintenance is funded\non an ad hoc basis. Generally, recurrent spending on this item is small. However, the capital\nexpenditure on pump schemes under the NIMP in 1996-1998 was about $30 million.\n10. The Japan International Cooperation Agency donates around 9,000 metric tons (t) of\nfertilizer (CIF $4.5 million) to the Government each year\u2014this is about 30 percent of the total\nfertilizer consumption in the country. The fertilizer is distributed through APB, which sells it at\n                                                \n2 The power tariff for irrigation is currently increasing at 3.5 percent per month. It is scheduled to increase by 125\npercent by December 2001. At that level, the subsidy will be about 53 percent.", "62\nAppendix 9, page 3\ncommercial rates.  In the south, there appears to be imports of fertilizer at prices that reflect the\nsubsidies of neighboring countries.\n3. Agricultural Benefits\n11. The Project will (i) organize farmers into WUAs and train them to carry out O&M of the\nschemes and adopt improved farming practices, and (ii) rehabilitate the pump stations and the\nwater  distribution  network.  The  direct  benefits  of  these  investments,  measured  as  the\nincremental net value of agricultural production, will be achieved from about 10 percent increase\nin the irrigated area, 5-10 percent increase in cropping intensity, 50 percent increase in wet\nseason and 65 percent increase in dry season paddy yields,3 and about 10-15 percent increase\nin vegetable yields. There would also be a switch in cropped area from relatively low value\ncrops  such  as  paddy  to  higher  value  crops  like  maize  and  vegetables.  Significant  yield\nincreases will result from adoption of better seed, more and efficient use of fertilizers, and better\nfarming and crop protection practices. An appropriately designed and well-executed extension\ncomponent will ensure that farmers get the requisite training and are able to optimize the project\ninvestment. These expectations are realistic and are based on experiences gained from recent\npilot  projects,  i.e.,  SIRAP.  Data  for  cropping  patterns,  cropping  intensity,  area,  yield,  and\nproduction for these three sites in without- and with-Project scenarios are presented in Tables\nA9.1 and A9.2.\n12. Irrigation  efficiencies  will  also  increase  significantly.  Currently,  most  pumps  do  not\noperate at full capacity for want of minor repairs and/or lack of technical knowledge among the\nfarmers. Most of the distribution network is not properly designed to carry water to farm fields\nefficiently.  A  redesigned  and  rehabilitated  distribution  network  will  considerably  improve\nirrigation efficiency as well as equity and also ensure timely availability of water at crucial stages\nof crop development. These improvements in irrigation will induce farmers to adopt better seed\nand apply more fertilizers to realize higher yields.\nB. Financial Analysis\n13. To determine the financial viability of the Project, detailed farm models were prepared for\nboth sites. Detailed interviews on input/output parameters with representative farmers were\nundertaken at each site.4 Household size and/or cropping practices do not significantly vary, but\nlandholding patterns slightly vary.\n1.  Feasibility Study Sites\n14. Nakhong, Vientiane Province.  The site is 40 kilometers (km) north of Vientiane. The\nirrigation  system  has  150  ha  with  111  landowners  using  the  irrigated  land.  Holdings  per\nhousehold vary from 0.32 ha to 4 ha. Average farm size is about 1.5 ha. About 40 percent of the\nholdings are of that size, while 20 percent are above average.\n15. Chom Thong, Vientiane Municipality. The site is around 20 km east of Vientiane, on\nthe banks of the Mekong River. The irrigation system has 250 ha, and 467 landowners use the\nirrigated land.  Holdings per household vary from 0.16 ha to 1.6 ha. Average farm size is 0.5 ha.\n                                                \n3 The value of effective extension service has been established time and again. The Lao-International Rice\nResearch Institute on-farm research has demonstrated that farmers could increase their paddy yields by 1.5 t/ha\nby adopting improved farming methods and without any additional inputs.\n4 The data were compared with those in other key studies, particularly the Community-Managed Irrigation Project\n(ADB, 1996), the Agriculture Strategy Study (ADB, 1999), and the Agriculture Sector Study (ADB, 1998).", "63\nAppendix 9, page 4\nOver 40 percent of the holdings are classified in this category and another 20 percent are above\naverage.\n2. The Current Situation\n16. The typical household comprises six persons, of whom two are of school age. Farming\nsystems are currently fairly similar in both sites. Rice production is predominant in the wet and\ndry seasons. While other options may be more profitable, in the current environment where\nwater  management  is  erratic,  fresh  produce  is  difficult  to  both  store  and  transport,  and\ncompetition from cheaper imports can lead to significant market price variations. Given this\nsituation, farmers are making rational choices by favoring rice production.\n17. Some vegetables, around 0.16 ha per household, are grown, generally adjacent to the\nirrigation  command  area.  Current  water  management  is  such  that  crop  choice  within  the\ncommand area is restricted to rice. Other crops would drown in the \u201call or nothing\u201d delivery\nsystem currently in place. Rice yields per hectare are fairly constant: around 2.0 t/ha in the wet\nseason and 3.0 t/ha in the dry season. However, wet season yields are a little higher in Chom\nThong where use of improved seed allows yields of around 2.8 t/ha.\n18. Typical input use in rice production is 50 kg each of urea and diammonium phosphate\nper ha per crop season. But smaller farmers may reduce these rates. With the exception of\nChom Thong, farmers do not buy improved seed frequently enough. Labor for planting and\nharvesting is generally sufficient; however, seedbed preparation is likely to be done by contract.\nLarger farmers tend to have their own machinery such as a walking tractor. Threshing is also\ndone by contract for 5 percent of the yield. Pesticides are not used and farmers currently pay\naround $5.5 as a seasonal electricity fee to the water user group (WUG). Living costs vary at\nboth sites, but allowance is made for milling rice for home consumption (typically, 1.8 t per\nhousehold),  other  food  purchases,  fuel  and  domestic  electricity,  housing  repair  and\nmaintenance, clothing, social obligations, school fees, and health costs. In addition, some land\ntax and sundry taxes are paid \u2013 typically around $13 per year.\n19. In Nakhong, an average household with a farm of 1.5 ha runs at a cash surplus of about\n$150  per  annum.  In  Chom  Thong,  located  closer  to  Vientiane,  off-farm  income  plays  an\nimportant  part  in  the  household  budget.  Working  capital  can  be  provided  from  cash  flow,\nhowever, smaller farmers with landholding of about 0.3 ha spend around three months in deficit\nbefore returning to surplus. Clearly, food security is not a significant problem.\n3. Project Financial Impact on Average Household\n20. After the rehabilitation, two types of levies, such as ISF and VDF, will be collected to\nensure routine O&M and the long-term sustainability of the subprojects. Financial analysis, based\non the site-specific farm models, indicates that after project implementation, farmers will raise their\nincomes significantly and be able to afford the levies.\n21. ISF will be established to provide full O&M funds for each irrigation system. The average\nISF  required  to  achieve  this  objective  has  been  estimated  at  $29/ha/year  (or  315  kg  of\npaddy/ha/year) at full development, considering future power tariff. However, farmers are already\npaying around $5.5/ha/year to WUG for power cost. In addition, they will contribute around\n$5.0/ha/year in labor. Thus, the additional cash cost for ISF at the future power rate will be\n$18.5/ha/year. However, with improved irrigation efficiency, power consumption may be reduced\nby 20 percent.", "64\nAppendix 9, page 5\n22. VDF will be levied after the IMT process is complete. The Government has established its\nrate according to the type of irrigation scheme. For gravity, electric pump, and diesel pump\nschemes, VDF will be levied at the rate of 200 ($18), 150 ($14), and 100 kg ($9) of paddy/ha/year,\nrespectively. For electric pumps, 80 percent of the revenue will stay with the WUA and the rest will\npass on to the district treasury. In case of diesel pumps, WUA will keep 95 percent of revenues.\nVDF is payable for a period of no more than 20 years, or until the capital costs are recovered. One\nimportant objective of the levy is to recover a portion of the sunk costs or rehabilitation costs of\nGovernment investment in irrigation schemes. The fund may be re-distributed to the wider village\ncommunity to finance small-scale village social development projects or fund emergency repairs\nto irrigation equipment.\n23. To be able to fund these additional costs, farmers will need to make adjustments to their\nfarming systems. However, such changes will have to take account of agronomic practices,\nhousehold labor, market access, and risk management. The farming system will continue to be\nrice based, but the area of other more profitable crops will marginally increase. These options will\nvary according to location. Farmers in Chom Thong, for example, will be able to expand their\nvegetable area while those in Nakhong will expand the area of less perishable crops, i.e., maize.\nThe gross margin for irrigated paddy is $165/ha, or $1.61/person-day, that for improved irrigated\nmaize is $340/ha or $7.83/person-day. However, any expected expansion of other crops takes\ninto account the household\u2019s food security as a priority.\n24. With improved and more reliable access to adequate flows of water, vegetable income will\nalso increase. Where farmers are now restricted to two vegetable crops per dry season, e.g.,\ncucumber or spring onion, they will be able to produce three crops. However, due to realities of\nmarket access, this option is assumed only for the Chom Thong site. In Nakhong, field crops, i.e.,\nmaize or soybeans, are assumed to be taken up as more profitable alternatives to paddy. The\nvegetable area will increase by 65 and 150 percent in Nakhong and Chom Thong, respectively.\nPaddy yields will increase from 2.0 to 3.0 t/ha in the wet season and from 3.0 to 5 t/ha in the dry\nseason. In Chom Thong, where the use of improved seed is relatively more common, wet season\ncrop yields will increase from 3.0 to 3.5 t/ha. The incremental production of paddy will be a result\nof improved yields and a small increase, around 10 percent, in the irrigated area. But it will be\npartly offset by a small increases in area under vegetable and/or field crops.\n25. By applying these assumptions and parameters, representative farm models for both sites\nwere generated. Based on the assumptions, the incremental impact on farm incomes will be\nsignificant. In Nakhong and Chom Thong, the incremental income of the average household will\namount to about $300 and $160 per annum, respectively. The required levies, ISF and VDF, will\namount to about 18 percent and 32 percent of the corresponding incremental incomes. After\nproject implementation, the cash flow of farming households will improve and the production base,\nand hence capacity to manage risk, will be strengthened.\n26. Sensitivity analysis for both sites shows that the impact of all measured variables at\nhousehold level is insufficient to cause a negative annual cash flow. The variables having an\nimpact on gross margins are the price of rice and dry season yields. Although a 20 percent\nreduction in either key variable will significantly reduce net profit, it does not result in either\nnegative cash flow or cash flows less than those attained under the without-project scenario. In\nsummary, the analysis shows that after project implementation, farm cash flows will be sufficiently\nrobust to withstand fairly significant fluctuations without causing the farm household any financial\nstress.", "65\nAppendix 9, page 6\nC. Economic Analysis\n1. Project Benefits\n27. Economic analysis for both sites is based on uniform assumptions, yields, and prices. The\nvariable parameters are the required investments, cropping pattern, and the cropped area. The\nselection of crops and the number of vegetable crops per year are based on water availability,\nlabor availability, and on marketing realities at both sites. Only the quantifiable benefits were taken\ninto account. Other benefits, i.e., improved family nutrition, increased economic activity in the\nvillage as a result of improved farm incomes, and increased employment opportunities, are\ndifficult to quantify and were not included in the analysis.\n2. Economic Life of the Project\n28. The overall economic life of the Project is 15 years. Field experience has shown that the\npumps, motors, and pontoon platforms of the type used in the Project can last that long or longer\nprovided regular O&M is carried out. The economic life of the distribution network, main and\nsecondary canals, and diversion structures is expected to be much longer than that of the\nassumed life. However, no residual benefits were attributed.\n3. Economic Internal Rate of Return\n29. The  indicative  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  for  both  subprojects  were\nestimated to be 22.6 and 24.0 percent for Nakhong and Chom Thong, respectively (Tables A9.3\nand A9.4).\n4. Sensitivity Analysis\n30. The sensitivity of the subproject EIRRs to changes in key assumptions was tested using\nthe switching value (SV). The SV percentage causes the EIRR to equal the opportunity cost of\ncapital assessed at 12 percent (Table A9.5).\n31. The sensitivity analysis suggests that a 20 percent decrease in the agricultural benefits\n(yields) will reduce the EIRR to 17.3 and 18.7 percent in Nakhong and Chom Thong, respectively.\nSimilarly, a 20 percent increase in the rehabilitation (cash) costs will reduce the EIRR to 19.4 and\n21.3, respectively. A simultaneous 20 percent decrease in benefits and a 20 percent increase in\n(cash) costs will reduce the EIRR to 14.6 and 15.8 percent, respectively. A one-year delay in\nproject benefits will decrease the EIRR to 19.5 percent in Nakhong and 21.7 percent in Chom\nThong.", "Table A9.1: Cropping Pattern, Cropping Intensity, Area, Yield, and Production of Main Crops in Nakhong \nWithout Project With Project Total\nArea  Crop Yield Prod Area Crop Yield Prod Incremental Prod\nItem             (ha) Share (%)a (kg/ha) (kg) (ha) Share (%) a (kg/ha) (kg) kg kg/ha\nCultivated Area 160 176\nCropped Area 318 398\nCropping Intensity (%) 199 226\nRice (wet) 160 100.00 2,000 320,000 176 100.00 3,000 528,000 208,000         1,182\nRice (dry) 128 80.00 3,000 384,000 132 75.00 5,000 660,000 276,000         1,568\nMaize (dry) 0 0.00 2,900 0 20 11.36 6,000 120,000 120,000            682\nSoybean (dry) 0 0.00 0 0 10 5.68 1,500 15,000 15,000              85\nCucumber (dry)b 30 9.38 15,000 450,000 60 17.05 17,000 1,020,000 570,000         3,239\n89.38 109.09\n6\n6\na   Respective crop's share in the cultivated area.\nb   Cucumber is taken as proxy for other vegetables, i.e., cabbage, onion, etc. Two crops are grown in one dry season so the area was assumed to be twice as much.\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n9\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n7", "                           Table A9.2:  Cropping Pattern, Cropping Intensity, Area, Yield, and Production of Main Crops in Chom Thong \nWithout Project With Project Total\nArea  Crop Yield Prod Area Crop Yield Prod Incremental Prod\nItem             (ha) Share (%)a (kg/ha) (kg) (ha) Share (%)a (kg/ha) (kg) kg kg/ha\nCultivated Area 250 275\nCropped Area 550 650\nCropping Intensity (%) 220 236\nRice (wet) 250 100.00 2,800 700,000 275 100.00 5,000 1,375,000 675,000 2,455\nRice (dry) 200 80.00 3,000 600,000 125 45.45 5,000 625,000 25,000 91\nMaize (dry) 0 0.00 2,900 0 30 10.91 6,000 180,000 180,000 655\nSoybean (dry) 0 0.00 0 0 20 7.27 1,500 30,000 30,000 109\nCucumber (dry)b 100 20.00 15,000 1,500,000 200 36.36 17,000 3,400,000 1,900,000 6,909\n100.00 100.00\na   Respective crop's share in the cultivated area. 6\n7\nb   Cucumber is taken as proxy for other vegetables, i.e., cabbage, onion, etc. Three crops are grown in one dry season so the area was assumed twice as much.\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 9\n, p\na\ng\ne\n 8", "Table A9.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Nakhong\n($)\nWithout- With Project\nProject Incremental\nYear O&M Investment Extension  O&M O&M Costs  Incremental Residual  Net \nper Year Cost Cost per Year per Year Production Value Cash Flow\n1          2 ,200            4 8,090             17,977                 -
