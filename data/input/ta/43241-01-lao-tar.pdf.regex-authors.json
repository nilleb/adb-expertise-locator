INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following the successful completion of technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building \nfor  Gender  Mainstreaming  in  Agriculture  in  2008,  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide \nadditional  TA  for  strengthening  capacity  in  gender-integrated  planning,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation in agriculture and forestry.1 An ADB reconnaissance mission visited Vientiane 15\u201319 \nMarch 2010 to consult with the Government of the Lao PDR and key stakeholders2 on the \nidentification of problem areas and how a follow-up TA might address remaining capacity issues. \nA draft TA concept paper was prepared in response to the request. A fact-finding mission was \nfielded in Vientiane 2\u20136 August 2010 to finalize the objectives and scope of the TA, and the \nformulation and implementation of issues of the proposed TA for Capacity Strengthening for \nGender  Mainstreaming  in  the  Agriculture  Sector.  The  government  confirmed  the  impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference of the proposed TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \nmidterm review 2007\u20132011 for the Lao PDR.3 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The agriculture sector contributes 39% to the Lao PDR\u2019s gross domestic product and \nemploys 80% of its predominantly agrarian population. Although women account for 54% of the \nagricultural  workforce,  they  receive  a  disproportionately  small  share  of  the  services  and \nresources directed at agricultural and rural livelihoods. Despite their significant contribution to \nthe national economy, women's roles in agriculture and forestry tend to remain mostly invisible \nand unaccounted for in public policies and programs. Gender gaps in the agriculture sector exist \nin (i) agriculture extension services; (ii) cultivation, commercialization, and other productivity \nenhancement interventions; (iii) market information; and (iv) financial services. Gender bias in \nservice delivery is the product of a wider, more systemic bias in the agriculture sector\u2019s planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluation model that reduces sector performance. Gender inequality has a \ndirect bearing on poverty reduction, given women\u2019s high level of participation in a variety of \nagricultural activities. To promote agriculture productivity, gender inequalities in rural service \ndelivery will have to be addressed. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) can therefore \nplay a central role in reducing gender disparities and rural poverty.  \n \n3.  This  TA  builds  on  the  experience  of  other  ADB-funded  TA  projects  on  gender \nmainstreaming in the region (Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam). The TA projects for both \nCambodia4 and Lao PDR focused on institutional setup, systems, and procedures; provision of \ngender-analysis training to agriculture sector personnel; and enhancement of women farmers\u2019 \naccess to agriculture extension services. The TA for Viet Nam5 focused its support on the \npreparation of a gender-mainstreaming planning handbook for the Ministry of Agriculture and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Capacity Building for Gender \nMainstreaming in Agriculture. Manila (TA 4655-LAO, approved on 29 September). \n2  Participatory consultations were held with the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the National Commission for the \nAdvancement of Women, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Bank, the Netherlands Development \nOrganization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization.  \n3  ADB. 2009.

Manila (TA 4459-CAM, approved on 2 December). \n5  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Gender Mainstreaming Action Plan for \nAgriculture and Rural Development. Manila (TA 4452-VIE, approved on 26 November). \n ", "2         \nRural Development (MARD); the provision of sex-disaggregated targets for the existing MARD \nplan;  guidelines  on  planning  and  monitoring  with  sex-disaggregated  targets;  and  training \ncurriculum support for MARD and the National Agriculture Extension Center. This TA goes \nfurther  by  functionally  integrating  the  government\u2019s  gender-mainstreaming  mechanism\u2014the \nDivision for the Advancement of Women (DAW)\u2014directly with central, provincial, and district \nplanners in routine planning, monitoring, and evaluation exercises, and by providing gender-\nmainstreaming  support  to  the  preparation  of  the  MAF  Strategy  for  Agriculture,  Natural \nResources and Rural Development 2020. The key lesson from previous TA projects is that \ncapacity building needs to be integrated into existing projects to provide tangible results. This \nTA will pilot a gender-integrated planning approach in nine provinces and selected districts in \nthe Lao PDR. \n \n4.  The TA will support human resource and technical capacity development for gender-\nintegrated planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the agriculture sector. As such, the TA falls \nunder the country strategy and program midterm review 2007\u201320116 pillar III goals to support \nboth  the  ability  of  public  officials  and  the  capacity  of  selected  sectors  to  develop  sector \nstrategies and improved budgeting, planning, and management capabilities in ministries for \nwhich  ADB  is  providing  support.  The  TA  is  in  line  with  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty \nEradication Strategy (2006), the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women (2006\u20132010), \nand MAF\u2019s Resolution for Gender Mainstreaming (2008). \n  \n5.  Discussions with MAF identified the following gaps and shortcomings: (i) gender has not \nbeen integrated into the planning cycle, (ii) gender-integration activities occur in development \npartner-funded projects without coordination with or links to MAF central planning and resource \nallocation processes, and (iii) statistics and information related to gender are dispersed and not \ncoordinated to inform systematic planning. The TA responds to the three areas needing support.  \n \n6.  Gender has not been integrated into the planning, monitoring, and evaluation cycle. \nDevelopment partners, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the \nNetherlands Development Organization, the Swedish International Development Cooperation \nAgency, and the World Bank, have supported area- or department-specific planning manuals for \ntheir projects. As with information systems and gender strategies, planning approaches tend to \nbe guided by project-specific outcomes and are not coordinated by MAF. The lack of uniform \nperformance  indicators  makes  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  gender  mainstreaming  in  the \nagriculture sector difficult. Training manuals on gender mainstreaming and area- and project-\nspecific participatory planning are abundant in MAF. However, manuals, guidelines, and tools \nfor gender-integrated planning, monitoring, and evaluation methods are lacking. It is, therefore, \nnecessary  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  MAF\u2019s  Department  of  Planning  and  line \ndepartment  planners  and  DAW  staff  with  training  support  in  gender-integrated  planning \napproaches for their day-to-day activities. Because MAF is shifting toward a program-based \napproach (Overseas Development Assistance Program Planning Unit), the TA is timely in its \nintent to align aid policies, strategies, and resources with a standardized gender-integrated \nplanning, monitoring, and evaluation approach to be applied to all MAF programs and projects. \n \n7.  Gender-integration  activities  occur  in  development  partner-funded  projects  without \ncoordination with or links to MAF central planning and resource allocation processes. Despite \nthe establishment of DAW, it is not consulted regarding the development of sector strategy. \nFurther, Sub-CAW (Commission for the Advancement of Women) members of line department \nlevels have yet to be involved in MAF\u2019s project planning processes and inception meetings. \nWhile DAW is well positioned in the MAF organizational hierarchy (Permanent Secretary\u2019s \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy Midterm Review: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 2007\u20132011. Manila. \n ", "    3\nOffice [PSO]), with an established gender network from the central (Sub-CAW  secretariat, \ndepartment-level Women\u2019s Advancement Unit), provincial (Provincial Agriculture and Forestry \nOffice deputy director as head of the Women's Advancement Unit), and district levels (gender \nfocal  points),  it  lacks  the  operational  tools  to  mainstream  gender  in  MAF\u2019s  systems  and \nframeworks. DAW\u2019s coordination effectiveness urgently needs to be strengthened through the \ndevelopment of a gender-responsive MAF strategy, master plan, and investment plan to enable \nit to exercise its mandated authority to mainstream gender in MAF.  \n \n8.  Statistics and information related to gender are dispersed and not coordinated to inform \nsystematic planning. Sex-disaggregated data, if it is collected at all, tends to be intervention-\nspecific,  which  is  symptomatic  of  the  lack  of  coordination  across  existing  projects  and \nagriculture sector activities. Hence, the utilization of indicators to plan, budget, monitor, and \nevaluate gender-responsive agriculture sector delivery and gender-inclusive resource allocation \nbetween men and women farmers is weak. MAF\u2019s Center for Statistics and Information, the \nDepartment of Statistics in the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), and a range of \ndevelopment partners are involved in managing the information needed for planning in the \nagriculture sector and collecting data for different purposes and audiences. Communication and \nsharing of information appears limited and needs coordination. Strengthening and rationalizing a \nuniform management information system (MIS) to inform gender-responsive planning in the \nagriculture sector will require collaboration and coordination of the various stakeholders.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be the effective implementation of a gender-sensitive MAF \nstrategy and action plan. The expected outcome of the TA will be the effective integration of \ngender issues into MAFs plans, programs and projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will produce three main outputs: (i) a gender-sensitive MAF strategy and action \nplan; (ii) gender-responsive MIS and MAF annual plans with sex-disaggregated targets; and (iii) \na pilot application of gender-integrated planning, monitoring, and evaluation in nine provinces\u2014\nfive  provinces  (Attapeu,  Champasack,  Saravan,  Savannakhet,  and  Xekong)  under  the \nSustainable Natural Resource Management and Productivity Enhancement Project (SNRMP)7 \nand four provinces (Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Oudomxai, and Phongsali) under the Northern Rural \nInfrastructure Development Project (NRIDP).8 In operational terms, the TA will institutionalize \nthe functional mechanisms in place for replicating and achieving a cascading effect for other \nADB projects. \n \n11.  Output 1: Gender-sensitive strategy and action plan for MAF. MAF is preparing a \nsector strategy,9 to be followed by a master action plan,10 and MAF investment plan.11 Because \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2009.

Manila (TA 7362-LAO, approved on 12 October). \n9  The MAF strategy will provide a framework defining sector targets and how it plans to achieve these targets. \n10 The Master action plan (5-year plan) details activities to achieve strategic targets, elaborating actions and \nmeasures. \n ", "4         \nof the urgent timelines, ADB will separately recruit a staff consultant to assist MAF\u2019s strategy \nformulation  team12 with  integrating  gender  elements  into  the  MAF  strategy.13 A  gender-\nmainstreaming and integrated-planning specialist will provide support to the master action plan \nand MAF investment plan. The TA will support MAF in preparing a gender-responsive MAF \nstrategy and master plan; drafting gender-integrated planning manuals; training MAF planners \nand DAW staff in gender-integrated planning, monitoring, and evaluation; and coordinating \nbetween MAF\u2019s gender-mainstreaming network14 and MAF\u2019s Planning Department in planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. Sustainability of gender mainstreaming will be ensured by the MAF \nstrategy, acting as a platform for other development partners to lend assistance in pre-identified \nand gender-responsive interventions. \n \n12.  Output 2: Gender-responsive MIS and MAF annual plans with sex-disaggregated \ntargets. The TA will support the development of a gender-responsive MIS and an organizational \nmechanism for the MIS to inform annual planning processes undertaken by MAF\u2019s Department \nof Planning with support from DAW. Both the specialist on sex-disaggregated data and the \ngender-responsive MIS specialist will be responsible for taking stock of sex-disaggregated data \nand developing uniform indicators to monitor the gender impact and performance of MAF\u2019s \nstrategy and action plan, programs, and projects to achieve the output.  \n \n13.  Output  3:  Gender-integrated  plans  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  system \nprepared by MAF planners and DAW network staff in nine pilot provinces. While outputs 1 \nand  2  will  provide  the  platform  for  gender-integrated  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation, \noutput 3 will provide the working tools. These include the preparation of a consolidated gender-\nintegrated planning manual and training of Sub-CAW and MAF provincial and district planners. \nTo achieve sustainability, an organizational mechanism will be developed to coordinate Sub-\nCAW  and  provincial  and  district  planners  as  they  undertake  their  gender-mainstreaming \nresponsibilities  in  the  implementation  of  MAF\u2019s  strategy  and  action  plan.  Their  functional \ncoordination will culminate in the preparation of gender-responsive subproject investments in \nnine pilot provinces. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  equivalent,  including  contingencies  and \ncontributions  from  the  government.  The  government  will  provide  an  in-kind  contribution  of \n$20,000. The government has asked ADB to finance $480,000 equivalent, covering the entire \nforeign-exchange cost. The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will finance the TA on a grant \nbasis. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The MAF\u2019s PSO and the Department of \nPlanning will be the implementing agencies. The implementing agencies will provide office \nspace, counterpart staff, and other services to consultants, and will arrange appointments for \nthem  with  relevant  agencies  and  organizations.  The  PSO  will  establish  a  TA  coordination \ncommittee  (chaired  by  the  MAF\u2019s  PSO)  with  members  from  MAF  departments  (Sub-CAW \n                                                                                                                                                          \n11 The MAF investment plan (5-year framework) details the projected type and amount of investments MAF seeks to \nsecure to achieve its targets and programs. \n12 The MAF strategy formulation team is coordinated by the Agriculture and Forestry Policy Research Center and \nincludes members from MAF line departments. DAW is not represented on the formulation team. \n13 The final draft of the MAF strategy is to be completed by the end of September 2010 for formal presentation to the \ngovernment. \n14 DAW is composed of Sub-CAW members representing each MAF line department. \n ", "    5\nNetwork) and representatives from the MPI\u2019s Department of Statistics, the Ministry of Finance, \nSNRMP,  and  NRIDP.  DAW  will  be  the  project  coordination  office.  The  TA  coordination \ncommittee will meet biannually, or more frequently as necessary. The coordination committee \nwill endorse the TA work plan before final approval by ADB. \n \n16.  For the pilot application in nine provinces, the TA will coordinate activities with the \nnational program coordination units of SNRMP and NRIDP. The participation of the provinces \ncovered by SNRMP and NRIDP will be financed under the training component of these two \nprojects. Detailed implementation arrangements between the TA and the two projects, including \nsupervision arrangements, will be finalized during the TA\u2019s inception phase and later included \nas part of the TA design mechanisms.  \n \n17.  The mechanism for DAW and MAF line department staff to coordinate gender-integrated \nplanning, monitoring, and evaluation into MAF\u2019s programs and projects will be used as a model \nfor replication. Clear operational roles and responsibilities for DAW and MAF line department \nstaff will be elaborated during the TA. Hence, in addition to the capacity building outputs, the TA \nintends to provide an operational mechanism for sustainability of gender mainstreaming within \nMAF.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from November 2010. The TA will engage \ntwo international consultants for a total of 10 person-months: a gender mainstreaming and \nintegrated planning specialist and team leader (8 person-months) and a gender-responsive MIS \nspecialist  (2  person-months).  National  consultants  (14  person-months)  will  be  recruited:  a \nspecialist  on  sex-disaggregated  data  (2  person-months)  and  a  gender-planning \nspecialist/deputy  team  leader  (12  person-months).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. The consulting team will be located in DAW. ADB will recruit all \nconsultants on an individual basis, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Funds  for  office  equipment,  workshops,  training, \nseminars, and conferences will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Funds for pilot application \nactivities will be managed by SNRMP and NRIDP. \n \n19.  The dissemination strategy will include a mechanism for a custodianship system to \npreserve materials used for gender-integrated planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Training \nmaterials will be shared with agricultural training institutions such as the National University of \nLao PDR. The purpose will be to make the materials available in the future and to alert other \ndevelopment partners and universities to their existence. Hence, trainers of the next generation \nof planners will imbue them with the gender-integrated approach. The key results and lessons of \nthe TA will be disseminated through seminar discussions, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nbriefing materials, and ADB\u2019s website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $480,000 to the Government \nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction for Capacity Strengthening for Gender Mainstreaming in the Agriculture \nSector, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nEffective implementation  Women farmer\u2019s access to  MAF Department of  Strong support from the \nof gender-sensitive MAF  agriculture extension reach  Planning reports  Lao PDR NCAW for \nstrategy and action plan  50% by 2015    gender mainstreaming \n     \nWomen\u2019s participation in  MAF action plan  Baseline database will \nprograms and projects in the  be available \nagriculture sector to reach   \n50% by 2015  Risk \n  Government priority \nshifts away from \nagriculture sector \ndevelopment \nOutcome      Assumption \nEffective integration of  50% of MAF investment plans  MAF strategy  Strong support by MAF \ngender in MAF plans,  will include gender-specific  MAF action plan  for gender \nprograms, and projects   mechanisms by 2012  MAF investment plan  mainstreaming (e.g., \nbudget, placement of \npersonnel)  \nOutputs   50% of MAF strategy, action  MAF strategy  Assumptions \n1.
