I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for additional financing of the Fourth Health Sector Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the current project in 2010.2 It was \ndesigned to improve health sector efficiency, governance, and drug safety, focusing on three \nkey areas: hospital services in Ulaanbaatar, human resources development, and a drug safety \nregime. The additional financing will significantly expand the output of the current project,3 \nestablishing  a  demonstration  multifunction  general  hospital  in  Songinohairkhan  district  of \nUlaanbaatar.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Under  the  current  project,  establishment  of  a  demonstration  multifunction  general \nhospital  was  planned  in  Songinohairkhan,  the  poorest  district  of  Ulaanbaatar,  to  include \nrenovating and expanding the infrastructure, equipping the hospital, and introducing innovative \nmanagement systems (original hospital output).5 Civil works under this output are planned to \nstart in the spring of 2013. In May 2011, the Parliament amended the health law, requiring \ngeneral  hospitals  to  provide  at  least  seven  specialized  medical  services.6 This  substantial \nincrease in mandated standards for delivery of health services by general hospitals means that \nthe funding allocated to the hospital output under the current project is no longer adequate to \nachieve the stated output. To accommodate the required upgrading, and considering the poor \nstate of the existing infrastructure, the government concluded that it was more efficient to \nconstruct  a  new  hospital  in  the  same  location  than  to  continue  with  the  original  plan  of \nrenovating and rehabilitating the old hospital complex. The government has therefore requested \nadditional financing to support the proposed project expansion. The government aims to use the \nnew  demonstration  general  hospital  as  a  model  to  be  replicated  in  the  nine  districts  of \nUlaanbaatar.7 This  300-bed  hospital8 will  include  modern  features  such  as  surgical  and \nmaternity services; adequate diagnostic and laboratory capacity; integrated management of out- \nand inpatient departments; model nursing care; proper medical waste management; adequate \n                                                 \n1  Consulting services for additional financing were provided through ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB)-\nfinanced  projects  in  the  health  sector  in  agreement  with  the  executing  agency.  (ADB.  2007.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia for the Third Health \nSector Development Project. Manila [Grant 0086-MON]; and ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia for the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. \nManila [Grant 0236-MON]). \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia \nfor the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. Manila (Grant 0236-MON). \n3  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  In the text, \u201coverall project\u201d refers to the current project and proposed additional financing. \n5  The demonstration hospital will disproportionally serve the poorest residents of Ulaanbaatar; Songinohairkhan \ndistrict is a typical destination for internal migrants displaced by natural disasters. \n6  2011 Amended Health Law, Article 16.12: General hospitals shall provide the population with health care and \nservices in no less than seven areas (internal, pediatrics, obstetrics, general surgery, dental care, neurology, and \ninfectious diseases) through the forms of ambulatory-based and inpatient treatment and care. It may have a \ndecentralized outpatient facility based on location and health needs of the population. \n7  Under the new hospital policy developed under the current project, there are plans to establish 11 general hospitals \nto cover the population of Ulaanbaatar by 2020. \n8  The exact number of beds will be determined at the hospital design stage. ", "2 \ninfection  prevention  and  control  measures;  and  advanced  information  technology  tools  for \npatient, procurement, and financial management.9  \n \n4.  Hospital infrastructure in Mongolia is generally poor. Moreover, the rapid population \ngrowth  in  Ulaanbaatar  requires  continuous  investments  in  hospitals.  The  expanded  output \ntargeted at construction of the demonstration multifunction general hospital is an integral part of \nthe broader effort to reform hospitals being supported under the current project. As part of the \ncurrent project, a hospital policy and a strategic hospital development plan to restructure public \nand private hospitals are expected to be approved by the cabinet in 2012. The broader financial \nimplications and funding requirements of a modern public hospital network are analyzed and are \npart of the impending strategic plan. A detailed operational plan including financial, human \nresources, and managerial aspects, is being developed for the demonstration hospital, with the \nassistance of the World Health Organization (WHO). The operational costs of providing higher-\nquality care through the demonstration hospital are projected to increase from the current level. \nActual costs will depend on factors such as the staff\u2013bed ratio, higher wages to motivate staff, \nand proper budgeting for maintenance services and capital depreciation.10 Recent and future \ntrends in Mongolia\u2019s public finance suggest that additional operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts for the demonstration hospital can be comfortably financed by rising public revenues. \n \n5.  Total  out-of-pocket  health  expenditures  are  estimated  at  17%\u201330%  of  total  health \nexpenditures in Mongolia, which is in line with the WHO\u2019s guideline of not exceeding 30%. \nAbout  80%  of  the  population  is  covered  by  health  insurance  and  about  50%  of  hospital \nrevenues are paid for by direct state funding. This contributes to accessibility and affordability. \nNevertheless, equity in accessing health care for the poorer segments of the population remains \na challenge, as some of these individuals do not have health insurance. In addition, out-of-\npocket payments are the rule for those who are insured. ADB is addressing equity issues \nthrough three ongoing projects11 and the reform of the citizens\u2019 health insurance law promoted \nby the Social Sectors Support Program.12  \n \n6.  The current project was assessed on the following indicators and is considered to be \nperforming well: \n(i)  Implementation results against expected project outputs. The current project \nhas established a solid foundation to achieve all outputs in the three key focus \nareas. The time estimated for completion of the original outputs has not yet been \nreached. Nonetheless, the hospital policy was submitted to and discussed in the \nhigh-level strategic hospital planning committee under the deputy prime minister, \nand is expected to be submitted to the cabinet within 2012. The strategic hospital \n                                                 \n9  Current general hospitals in districts of Ulaanbaatar offer a limited range of services, delink out- and inpatient \nservices, and have limited laboratory and information technology capacity. \n10 Operational costs of the current district hospital in Songinohairkhan are estimated at 10% of investment costs; \ntypically, capital depreciation costs are not included, while maintenance, consumables, and pharmaceuticals are \nunderfunded. \n11 ADB. 2007. Proposed Grant Assistance to Mongolia for Access to Health Services for Disadvantaged Groups in \nUlaanbaatar. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Proposed Grant Assistance to Mongolia for Protecting the Health Status of \nthe Poor during the Financial Crisis. Manila; and footnote 2. \n12 ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Social Sectors Support Program. Manila. The program helped \nensure that the budget for social sector expenditures remained adequate during the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis. It \nalso implemented a set of policy measures in the social welfare, health, and education sectors to provide essential \nsocial services, and to initiate longer-term reforms to improve the targeting of social assistance and health \ninsurance, and living conditions of the poor. In early 2011, the cabinet submitted the draft citizens\u2019 health insurance \nlaw to the Parliament; it is tabled for discussion at the spring session of the Parliament ending in February 2013. \nThe draft law includes improved targeting of government subsidies for health insurance for the poor. \n ", "3 \ndevelopment plan, which will provide operational details on hospital restructuring, \nis also expected to be submitted to the government for approval within 2012. The \nwork on strengthening postgraduate specialist education is still at an initial stage \nand technical assistance is being provided as planned. A revision of the outdated \n2002\u20132011 drug policy is being undertaken to better define needed reforms of \ndrug regulatory functions. These steps will precede establishment of the new \ndrug regulatory authority. Human resources for the drug regulatory authority are \nbeing  recruited.  The  General  Agency  for  Specialized  Inspection  (GASI)  is \nmonitoring very closely the timely completion of the central laboratory and plans \nto invite the design qualification expert within 2012 to ensure that the drug control \nlaboratory meets the requirements for international accreditation. \n(ii)  Implementation progress. Implementation progress is satisfactory. The current \nproject had achieved 30% of cumulative physical progress against 32% elapsed \ntime by September 2012. Cumulative contract awards and disbursement are \nconsistent with projections. \n(iii)  Safeguard compliance. Safeguard requirements are being met. The grievance \nredress mechanism under the environmental management plan was established \nfrom the start of the current project and no complaint has been received. The \nenvironmental management plan was updated and approved by ADB. The first \nannual environmental monitoring report was submitted to ADB in July 2012. \nGASI  and  the  Central  Laboratory  are  complying  with  the  requirement  for \nhazardous  chemical  waste  management.  The  gender  action  plan  is  being \nimplemented  satisfactorily.  Resettlement  is  not  required  under  the  current \nproject. There are no safeguard issues regarding indigenous peoples. \n(iv)  Management of risks. Risks are being managed successfully. The report and \nrecommendation of the President to the ADB Board of Directors for the current \nproject identified major risks as (a) resistance to change from key health workers' \ngroups  and  government  agencies,  and  the  community;  and  (b)  lack  of \ngovernment  and  community  support  for  hospital  reform.  No  resistance  has \nemerged, although hospital reforms were discussed in broad fora involving many \nstakeholders,  and  information  campaigns  were  organized.  Agencies  such  as \nGASI, the State Property Committee, and professional associations have been \nkeen  to  actively  participate  in  the  discussion  on  hospital  reform.  Mitigation \nmeasures proposed in the risk assessment and risk management plan of the \ncurrent project are being implemented and potential risks have not materialized.  \n(v)  Project performance rating. The current project is rated on track in the project \nperformance rating. \n \n7.  The design of the current project was relevant and consistent with previous initiatives to \nreform the Mongolian health sector in line with the National Development Strategy to 2021 and \nthe government\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan (2006\u20132015). The current project focuses on three \nkey areas: (i) hospital services in Ulaanbaatar, (ii) human resources development, and (iii) a \ndrug  safety  regime.  The  current  project,  enhanced  by  the  additional  financing  (the  overall \nproject),  will  improve  governance  in  the  sector  by  improving  public  investment  planning, \nproviding decent and efficient hospital services, protecting the population against counterfeit \nand substandard drugs, and facilitating public access to information on hospital performance \nand drug safety. At the same time, hospital reforms give the government a unique opportunity to \nestablish public\u2013private collaboration for the benefit of the population. The overall project will \ndeliver tangible benefits to women by ensuring their active participation in institutional processes \nto reform hospitals and drug safety. \n \n ", "4 \n8.  The additional financing is considered to meet the four eligibility criteria for additional \nfinancing.13 First, ADB reviewed the current project in April 2012 and confirmed the satisfactory \nperformance  and  that  no  significant  changes  in  approaches  and  methodologies  were \nenvisioned.14 Accordingly, the current project remains technically feasible, economically viable, \nand financially sound. Second, the government accords high priority to the current project as \nproposed  to  be  expanded  through  the  additional  financing.  The  demonstration  hospital \nrepresents a concrete step in implementing the 2011 amended health law, as acknowledged by \nthe government\u2019s request for additional financing. Third, the project outcome remains the same, \nwhile the output related to the demonstration hospital, supported by the additional financing, will \nbe enhanced and remains consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives. Fourth, the \nexpanded project and its outcome are consistent with the current country partnership strategy, \n2012\u20132016, 15 which  emphasizes  social  development  through  efficient  delivery  of  health \nservices.  \n \n9.  The additional financing modality is highly relevant as the modification in respect of the \ndemonstration hospital output will make it possible to meet the objectives of the current project \nin light of the amended health law requiring higher standards for general hospitals. The Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan modality is relevant to finance major infrastructure rather than using \nAsian  Development  Fund  grant  funding  as  in  the  current  project.  The  current  project \nimplementation  arrangements  (i.e.,  project  steering  committee,  implementing  agency,  and \nproject  implementation  unit)  are  effective  and  ensure  a  high  degree  of  readiness  in \nimplementing the additional financing. The development of the hospital policy and strategic \nhospital development plan under the current project and continuing under the overall project \nprovides  a  framework  for  later  replication  of  the  demonstration  general  hospital  to  be \nestablished under the additional financing. The enhanced model character of the new hospital \nwill reinforce its demonstration effect and will provide a strong incentive for reforming hospitals \nin Mongolia as promoted under the current project.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  and  outcome  statements  of  the  current  project  will  be  retained.  The \nexpected impact of the overall project will be to improve the health status of the Mongolian \npopulation,  including  the  poor.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  health  sector  efficiency, \ngovernance, and drug safety.  An outcome and an impact indicator will be added to reflect the \nstrengthened hospital sector. The outputs will also be retained, except for the indicators of the \noriginal output 3 related to establishment of the demonstration hospital. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The 12 outputs of the overall project are regrouped under three components: \n(i)  Component 1: Strengthened hospital services in Ulaanbaatar. The overall \nproject will assist the government in preparing a hospital development policy and \nstrategic  plan  for  Ulaanbaatar  (output  1),  operationalize  a  hospital  capital \nplanning  system  (output  2),  turn  the  Songinohairkhan  district  hospital  of \nUlaanbaatar into a multifunction general hospital (output 3), and improve the \nhospital governance system (output 4). \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2011.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).19 The significant expansion of the hospital output \nunder the additional financing requires adjusting the procurement and consultant packages, as \nwell as reallocating the grant proceeds under the current project, as further detailed in the \nPAM.20 In other respects, the existing implementation arrangements under the current project \nwill be retained for the overall project.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period and loan  April 2013\u2013June 2016 \nclosing date  Loan closing date: 31 December 2016  \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2016 \nManagement   \n(i) Oversight body  The project steering committee of the current project will serve as the steering \ncommittee of the overall project, including additional financing of the Fourth Health \nSector Development Project.

All project financial \nmatters, procurement, and recruitment of consultants will be handled by the PIU \nunder the supervision of the MOH. \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  1 contract  $23.01 million \nNational competitive bidding  1 contract  $0.33 million \nConsulting Services  Quality- and cost-based selection  2 contracts  $0.96 million \n154 person-months \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting was approved for one consulting service contract. \nDisbursement  The grant and loan proceeds for the overall project will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMF = design and monitoring framework, GASI = General Agency for Specialized \nInspection, MOH = Ministry of Health, PIU = project implementation unit. \na  The government underwent a recent restructuring whereby the newly created Ministry of Economic Development in \ncharge of loan and grant policy, strategy, negotiations, and ratification could join as a member of the project \nsteering committee in the future. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n16.  The technical aspects of the overall project are sound. A systematic approach is applied \nto development of the hospital policy and the strategic hospital development plan to ensure \nstakeholder participation, operational feasibility, and financial sustainability. A reputable design \nfirm will update the preliminary hospital site plan, including access, parking, and greenery, in \nline with improved construction and operational standards. The hospital will be managed by the \ngovernment with support from the private sector. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n17.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  viability  of  the  overall  project.  The \nanalysis covers the macroeconomic context so as to review the potential for the government to \ncontinue to finance the project activities in the longer term, following project completion. The \nanalysis  covers  the  quantifiable  economic  costs  and  benefits  for  the  improved  hospital \ncomponent and provides qualitative analysis of the drug safety component. The economic \nimpact of unsafe medicine is difficult to quantify because there are a number of unknown \nvariables. Using conservative estimates of project implementation, the baseline results show an \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  11.95%,  reflecting  substantial  unquantifiable \neconomic benefits. The EIRR was tested through sensitivity analysis using a 20% decrease in \neconomic benefits as the worst-case scenario for each of the economic benefits relating to \nhospital efficiency savings, out-of-pocket cost savings for patients, and reduction in projected \nproductivity  improvements.  Under  these  conservative  assumptions,  the  EIRRs  range  from \n7.59% to 11.01%; hence, the project is considered economically viable.21 \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003. Economic Analysis of Projects. Operations Manual. OM G1/OP. Manila (B.[vi][b] states that a low EIRR \nis acceptable when there are substantial unquantifiable benefits). \n ", "8 \n18.  The overall project has no revenue-earning component; hence, financial cost benefits \nwere  not  analyzed  as  part  of  the  financial  analysis.  The  MOH,  Ulaanbaatar  City  Health \nDepartment, and GASI will contribute counterpart funding and bear the project\u2019s O&M costs. A \nfiscal analysis indicated that the annual average contribution of the MOH to the overall project is \n0.5% of the health sector annual budget. The annual O&M cost, to be borne by GASI, will not \nexceed 2.0% of its current revenue. Additional O&M costs required by the Ulaanbaatar City \nhealth  organizations  for  the  demonstration  hospital  will  be  about  0.6%  of  its  total  annual \nexpenditure.  The  counterpart  funding  and  O&M  costs  are  considered  both  financially \nsustainable and affordable. A financial management assessment concluded that the MOH is \nexperienced in managing ADB projects and is prepared for project implementation. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MOH for the additional financing activities. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). The MOH \nhas been a partner of ADB since 1991. The project implementation unit established for the \ncurrent project, which is performing satisfactorily, will continue to handle all project financial \nmatters, procurement, and recruitment of consultants, supervised by the MOH. The government \nthrough the MOH will ensure that civil works supervisory responsibility will be assigned to the \nfirm  in  charge  of  designing  the  new  hospital.  The  Ulaanbaatar  Mayor\u2019s  Office  recently \nunderwent  a  procurement  and  financial  capacity  assessment  for  the  Urban  Transport \nDevelopment  Investment  Program,  which  concluded  that  the  Municipality  of  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \nfinancial management, procurement, reporting, and monitoring systems are satisfactory. 22 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n20.  The overall project will directly benefit more than 260,000 mostly poor residents of the \nSonginohairkhan  district  of  Ulaanbaatar  by  improving  district  hospital  services.  Additional \nfinancing will improve the range and quality of hospital services provided to the population \nbeyond the services that were planned under the current project. The overall project will also \nbenefit the entire population of Mongolia by improving access to safer drugs, and, in the long \nrun, will improve allocative efficiency in the health sector by optimizing the use of hospital \nservices and improving the return on future investment in hospitals. Poverty and health are \nstrongly related, and better health services are not only a social goal but also a prerequisite to \neconomic development. Therefore, improved health care will expand the economic opportunities \nof the whole population, including the poor. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nhas been updated to reflect the additional financing component. \n \n21.  The  current  project  and  the  additional  financing  are  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. In Mongolia, the health status of the population is highly differentiated by sex. \nThe male mortality rate is high, and male life expectancy is low compared with females, due \nprimarily to unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking and heavy drinking. Women comprise the \nmajority of users and providers of the health care system in Mongolia, and 20% of households \nin urban areas in Mongolia are headed by women.23 Women provide the majority of care for ill \nfamily members. The vast majority of the country\u2019s total medical staff consists of women (82%). \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2012.

Safeguards \n \n22.  Environment.  The  environment  categorization  of  the  current  project  and  additional \nfinancing is B. Environmental impact assessments were carried out in accordance with the \nMongolia regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Two domestic \nenvironmental assessments\u2014for the new Songinohairkhan demonstration hospital and the new \ncentral laboratory\u2014were conducted in compliance with Mongolian law, and approved by the \nMinistry of Nature, Environment and Tourism.24 The initial environmental examination of the \ncurrent  project  was  updated  to  address  the  environmental  implications  of  the  new \nSonginohairkhan demonstration hospital, approved by ADB and disclosed on the ADB website \non 24 August 2012. Potential adverse impacts during the construction and operation phases \ninclude limited standard construction impacts; and occupational and community health and \nsafety issues during operation, especially unsafe collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of \nmedical and chemical hazardous waste. A temporary storage system for medical wastes will be \ninstalled at the new Songinohairkhan demonstration hospital during construction of the new \nhospital, and an integrated waste management system in compliance with MOH policies will be \nconstructed at the new hospital.25 The new central laboratory has installed a holding system for \nchemical and hazardous liquid wastes. The new Songinohairkhan demonstration hospital and \nnew central laboratory will be connected to the Ulaanbaatar centralized systems for water \nsupply,  wastewater  collection,  electricity,  and  heating  systems.  The  updated  initial \nenvironmental examination report includes a comprehensive environmental management plan \nwhich  defines  environmental  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  requirements,  institutional \nresponsibilities, and training and capacity building requirements. The government is committed \nto  managing  identified  environmental  risks  and  has  agreed  on  a  comprehensive  set  of \nenvironment-related loan covenants. The executing agency conducted meaningful consultation \nwith and disclosed relevant environment information to the affected people. Consultation and \npublic  participation  will  continue  throughout  overall  project  implementation  and  any \nenvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress \nmechanism established for the overall project. \n \n23.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The demonstration hospital will be \nconstructed on the existing government-owned land site where the present hospital is situated. \nThe site comprises sufficient land to accommodate the new construction within its boundaries \nsuch that construction will not cause any resettlement impact. Therefore, the overall project and \nadditional financing remain category C for resettlement; a resettlement plan is not required. The \ncurrent project and additional financing will not have any negative impact on indigenous peoples \nand, therefore, the current project and additional financing are category C. No further actions \nare required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n24.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n                                                 \n24 Currently the Ministry of Environment and Green Development. \n25 Ministerial  orders  158  and  179  of  2011  on  procedures  for  health  care  waste  collection,  sorting,  storage, \ntransportation, disposal, and processing. \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of government support for hospital  The overall project will ensure continuing policy dialogue with the \nreform  government  and  donor  community.

ASSURANCES \n \n25.  The government and MOH have assured ADB that implementation of the additional \nfinancing shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement,  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n26.  The  government  and  MOH  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \noverall project, which are set forth in the grant agreement of the current project and the loan \nagreement for the additional financing. Due to project modification introduced with the additional \nfinancing, the time frames for performance of selected covenants in the loan agreement relating \nto the hospital reform component have been extended for an additional 12 months. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n27.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR16,240,000 to Mongolia for the additional financing of the Fourth \nHealth Sector Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to \nthe Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n15 October 2012 \n ", " \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Data Sources \nSummary  Performance Targets and  Performance Targets and  and Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  (Overall  Indicators with Baselines  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \n(Current Project)  Project)  (Current Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact          Assumption \nImproved health  No  Poverty level reduced from 36.2%  Poverty level reduced from  Household Socio- Mongolia\u2019s economic \nstatus of the  change  in 2008 to 18.0% by 2020  36.2% in 2008 to 18.0% by  economic  growth is able to fund \nMongolian    2020  Survey/NSO   social sectors and \npopulation,  Maternal mortality reduced from  Maternal mortality reduced    create employment \nincluding the poor  60 per 100,000 live births as of  from 60 per 100,000 live  MDG assessment \nFebruary 2010 to 30 per 100,000  births as of February 2010 to  report \nlive births in 2020  30 per 100,000 live births in   \n2020   \nAccessibility and quality of  Annual survey \nhospital services in \nUlaanbaatar improved \n(baseline measured in 2014) \nOutcome          Assumption \nImproved health  No  Strategic hospital development  A road map to establish 10  Cabinet decree  Health remains a key \nsector efficiency,  change  plan for Ulaanbaatar and capital  additional general hospitals  and national  concern of \ngovernance, and  investment planning system in  by 2020 is approved by 2016   conference report  government \ndrug safety  place by 2016  At least 50% reduction in the    Risk \nAt least 50% reduction in the  number of illegal, counterfeit,  Study using the  Resistance to change \nnumber of illegal, counterfeit,  substandard, or not quality- standard WHO  from key staff groups \nsubstandard, or not quality- assured drugs on the market  methodology   (e.g., hospital \nassured drugs on the market in  in 2016 from 26% in 2007    specialists), agencies \n2016 from 26% in 2007  A transparent public reporting  Ministerial order  (e.g., GASI), sectors \nA transparent public reporting  system on hospital  (MOH)  (e.g., private \nsystem on hospital performances  performances and drug  hospitals), and the \nand drug safety in place by 2016  safety is in place by 2016  community \nComponent 1: Strengthened Hospital Services in Ulaanbaatar \nOutputs          Assumption  A\np\n1.
