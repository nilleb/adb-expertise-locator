THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Strengthening Public Financial Management Program (SPFMP), \n(ii) a proposed policy-based loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 1 of the SPFMP, \nand (iii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram \n1 of the SPFMP.1  \n \n2.  The programmatic approach seeks to increase the availability and efficiency of public \nservices in Cambodia, including services for poor and vulnerable groups, by strengthening \npublic expenditure and revenue management. In support of stage 3 of the government\u2019s four-\nstage Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP, [para 9 and 10]), the proposed \nprogram will finance actions and initiatives to strengthen (i) the policy and regulatory framework \nfor expenditure and revenue management, (ii) the procedures and capacities of select line \nministries to implement budgeting and expenditure management reforms, and (iii) the capacity \nof the external audit function.2 The proposed program is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018 for Cambodia of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development problem. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of over 6% \nannually between 2007 and 2015 (7% in 2015), with continuing strong revenue growth in 2015 \n(para. 4). Continuous economic growth helped reduce the poverty rate from 47.8% in 2007 to \n13.5% in 2014. However, many Cambodians are only marginally above the poverty line (41% \nlive on less than $2 a day and 72% on less than $3 a day).4 Low inclusiveness, largely because \nof weak public financial management (PFM) systems, contributes to this continuing vulnerability. \nLarge gaps remain in critical public services, including basic and technical education; health; \ninfrastructure (roads, irrigation, water, electricity, and sanitation); and extension of agriculture \nand fisheries. These gaps need to be addressed for growth to become more inclusive.5 A study \non Cambodia\u2019s poverty dynamics identified weak governance institutions (including weak PFM), \nand insufficient public services as key medium-term constraints to inclusive growth and poverty \nreduction. The study pointed out weaknesses in the allocation of public resources, as well as \ninadequate targeting of the poor and vulnerable groups.6 While important challenges were met \nunder stages 1 and 2 of the PFMRP, overcoming further weaknesses in PFM\u2014a pillar of \ngovernance to improve service delivery\u2014is a high government priority.7  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2004.

Phnom Penh.  \n7 The government has three related public sector management reform programs in PFM, public administration, and \ndecentralization. The SPFMP will support implementation of stage 3 of the PFMRP with links to decentralization \nreform. The Government of Germany supports public administration reform.     \n ", "2 \n4.  Evidence from Cambodia and other countries indicates that better PFM can create room \nin the government\u2019s budget to provide, and improve the quality of, public services.8 Domestic \nrevenue collections under the PFMRP rose by 4% of GDP from 2013 to 2015 (with nominal \ngrowth of 14.2% in 2015), while operational efficiency gains also provided new fiscal space. \nHowever, resource allocation is not yet optimal: current expenditures (8.9% of GDP in 2009; \n13.9% in 2015) are growing much faster than capital expenditures (6.0% of GDP in 2004; 7.5% \nin 2015).9 Some expenditures have been redirected from low to high priority programs, but this \nhas been insufficient. For example, agriculture spending rose from 0.6% of GDP in 2013 to \n0.9% in 2015, while education spending increased from 1.7% of GDP in 2013 to 2.1% in 2015.  \n \n5.  Binding  constraints.  The  government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  III,  which  sets  out \nmedium-term  policies  and  priorities,  identifies  governance,  including  PFM,  as  a  binding \nconstraint to improving the availability and quality of public services.10 The public expenditure \nand financial accountability framework (para. 11) and other assessments, including diagnostics \nprepared for this program, identify three continuing weaknesses in the PFM system, which will \nbe addressed under the program and are in line with objectives of stage 3 of the PFMRP.11 \nOther  broader  constraints  include:  low  human  capacities  after  decades  of  conflict,  highly \ncentralized  public  service  delivery  arrangements;  and  inadequate  infrastructure.  These  are \nbeing addressed by other ADB interventions (para. 15).      \n \n6.  National policies, regulatory frameworks, and systems. The remaining weaknesses  \ninclude  (i) the  absence of comprehensive guidelines for budget preparation, execution, and \ntransparent  financial  and  performance  reporting;  (ii)  limited  implementation  of  a  financial \nmanagement  information  system  (FMIS),  which  is  currently  confined  to  the  central  and \nprovincial departments of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF); (iii) limited development \nof a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and budgeting to guide program budget \npreparation and to allocate resources effectively between central and subnational levels; (iv) \nweak  links  between  the  budget  and  development  polices;  (v)  an  incomplete  regulatory \nframework to allow the National Assembly to approve the budget law by programs; (vi) weak \ncapacity for revenue policy formulation and administration at central and subnational levels; (vii) \nunderdeveloped internal audit regulations, including limited guidelines and capacity for audits of \ninternal control systems and information and communication technology; and (viii) an incomplete \nregulatory framework for public debt management, including for government guarantees.  \n \n7.  Weak capacities of line ministries. Ministries, particularly those delivering key public \nservices, need to improve budgets and expenditure management. Weaknesses include (i) poor \nbudget planning and preparation; (ii) incomplete integration of current and capital budgets; (iii) \nlimited inclusion of gender and poverty in plans and budgets; (iv) weaknesses in preparing and \nreporting on program budgets; (v) operational challenges of newly established budget entities; \n(vi)  low  budget  execution  capacities  and  reporting  systems,  including  incomplete \n                                                \n8  For example V.

Weak  external  audit  functions.  Weaknesses  include  limited  audit  capacities  of  the \nNational Audit Authority (NAA) particularly in meeting new demands for audit of line ministries in \nimplementing  program  budgeting  in  an  FMIS  environment,  and  in  having  to  expand  audit \ncoverage  to  include  subnational  administrations,  particularly  the  districts,  which  are  being \nempowered with more functions and resources.  \n \n9.  Reform agenda. In 2005, the government initiated comprehensive reforms through the \nfour-stage PFMRP.12 Stage 1 (2005\u20132008), which began when PFM systems were seriously \ndeficient,  aimed  to  increase  budget  credibility  by  delivering  more  predictable  resources  to \nbudget managers, including eliminating chronic cash shortages and payment arrears. Credibility \nwas substantially achieved by 2008 and has been maintained since then through improved \nrevenue mobilization, public debt management, and cash and bank account management.      \n \n10.  Stage 2 (2009\u20132015) aimed for more effective financial accountability  by improving \ninternal controls and management accountability. Progress included (i) budget classifications \nand chart of accounts consistent with international standards; (ii) 3-year rolling budget strategic \nplans  (BSPs),  and  piloting  of  program  budgeting;  (iii)  early  work  to  unify  the  capital  and \nrecurrent  budgets;  (iv)  procurement  reform,  including  adoption  and  implementation  of  the \nProcurement Law (2012); (v) stronger internal controls and internal audit units in MEF and line \nministries;  (vi)  implementation  of  phase  1  of  the  FMIS  within  MEF  and  its  provincial \ndepartments; (vii) design and implementation of the medium-term revenue mobilization strategy, \n2014\u20132018; and (viii) capacity development. Stage 3 (2016\u20132020), which seeks to improve \nbudget\u2013policy links, could not have proceeded without the foundation provided by policy and \ntechnical reforms and piloting in stages 1 and 2. Key stage 3 activities to be supported under \nthe proposed program are addressed in paras. 19\u201325. Stage 4 (2021\u20132025) aims to improve \nperformance accountability. \n \n11.  PFM performance assessments using a public expenditure and financial accountability \nframework,  carried  out  in  2010  and  2015,  confirmed  gradual  progress  under  the  PFMRP \n(footnote 11). From 2010 to 2015, Cambodia recorded solid ratings in (i) budget credibility (from \nC+  to  B),  (ii)  policy-based  budgeting  (stable  at  B+),  and  (iii)  comprehensiveness  and \ntransparency of the budget (from C to C+). However, ratings were stable on (i) predictability and \ncontrols in budget execution (stable at C); (ii) accounting, recording, and reporting (stable at C); \nand (iii) external scrutiny and audit (not rated in 2015; D+ in 2010). The 2015 assessment \nrecorded an overall average rating of C to C+ in line with other low to middle-income countries. \nFor  example,  the  corresponding  overall  average  rating  for  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic was C (2010), Myanmar was D+ (2012), and Viet Nam was C+ (2013). Improving the \nratings to A and B categories will take time, which the program will pursue. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s experience and lessons. ADB has supported PFM and decentralization reforms \nsince around 2001 (Figure 1). Earlier support to PFM focused on macroeconomic management, \nfiscal policy, financial management, and audit functions. From 2008 to 2015, support focused on \nstages 1 and 2 of the PFMRP through the PFM for rural development program cluster, which \n                                                \n12  The Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2) provides more on the PFMRP. \n ", "4 \nprovided policy-based lending and several TA interventions.13 ADB\u2019s support to decentralization \nreforms  has  focused  on  administrative,  fiscal  and  PFM  arrangements  for  subnational \nadministrations. Important lessons include: (i) PFMRP is a complex long-term program that has \nmade gradual progress from a very low base after decades of conflict, thus long-term commitment \nand support are required; (ii) policy-based loans and TA interventions allow policy and regulatory \nshortfalls at the central level; and weak systems and human capacities in line ministries, to be \naddressed simultaneously; (iii) improved coordination within MEF, and between MEF and the \nline  ministries,  is  essential for  successful  design  and  implementation of reforms;  (iv)  PFM \nreforms at the central level should be closely aligned with subnational PFM systems; and (v) \nwell-designed intergovernmental financing policies are needed to enhance decentralized service \ndelivery.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13.      ADB\u2019s  value  added.  The  PFM  for rural  development  program  cluster  (footnote  13) \nprovided experience in developing policies and a regulatory framework for financial accountability \nand in supporting selected line ministries (agriculture, rural development, and water resources and \nmeteorology) and the NAA to implement them. The post-program partnership framework for this \nprogram cluster enabled broader policy dialogue, leading to the inclusion of four policy actions \n(FMIS implementation, expansion of internal audit units, strengthening debt management, and \nregulatory reform for external audit) under subprogram 1; and the development of program impacts, \noutcomes, and outputs. As the multi-donor trust fund managed by the World Bank, which has \nsupported implementation of stages 1 and 2 of the PFMRP, is expected to end in 2017, the \ngovernment has requested ADB to take on a greater role in supporting stages 3 and 4 of the \nPFMRP. ADB adds value by improving the design of reforms and supporting their implementation in \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nline ministries, where ADB is the only development partner which has provided focused support; \nstrengthening external audit to include audit of subnational administrations; and aligning PFM \nreforms at central level with decentralized fiscal and PFM reforms.14    \n \n14.  The programmatic approach. The programmatic approach with a policy-based loan \nand supporting TA interventions as used in the previous PFM for rural development program \ncluster (footnote 13) is proposed to continue for this program because it will further leverage the \nimplementation of complex medium-term policy reforms of the government. The approach has \nproved to be effective in supporting the government to implement its long-term PFMRP. The \nproposed program utilizes two subprograms to support a well sequenced package of policy \nreforms over the period 2014\u20132019. Subprogram 1 focused on completion of stage 2 and \nundertaking  advance  actions  for  stage  3,  while  subprogram  2  actions  will  support  full \nimplementation of stage 3 of the PFMRP. The sequenced approach will significantly improve the \npolicy and regulatory framework for expenditure and revenue management at central level while \ndeveloping systems and capacities of line ministries to implement the reform agenda. The \nregulatory regime and capacities of the external audit function will also be strengthened. The \nmedium-term  directions  and  expected  results  framework  will  be  used  to  continue  ADB\u2019s \nengagement and to assess program effectiveness.   \n \n15.  Synergies  with  other  ADB  interventions. The  proposed  program  will  continue  to \nsupport MEF, the NAA, and the three rural development ministries and will expand support to \nthree additional priority ministries: education, youth, and sports; labor and vocational training; \nand public works and transport. The proposed program will be much broader in technical and \nagency coverage than the previous one addressing key issues of linking policy and budgets. \nThe program will promote synergies through improved PFM performance with ongoing and \nfuture ADB interventions within the six targeted ministries, which are responsible for priority \nsectors in ADB\u2019s current country partnership strategy, 2014-2018.15 The proposed program will \nfurther  strengthen  synergies  with  the  ADB\u2019s  support  for  decentralization  with  the  former \ntargeting the central administration level and the latter targeting the subnational level, with both \nlevels interrelated. The proposed PFM program will support the decentralization program by (i) \nalignment of central and local PFM systems; (ii) reform of deconcentrated activities of central \nministries at the province and district levels; (iii) reforms to the intergovernmental financing \nsystem, which will be addressed through proposed MTEF reforms; and (iv) support to the NAA \nto audit subnational administration finances.        \n \n16.  Coordination  with  development  partners.  The  PFMRP  receives  well-coordinated \nsupport from development partners through the PFM technical working group, which brings \ntogether the government and its development partners to discuss progress and resolve key \nreform challenges. The proposed program will coordinate closely with development partners \nincluding  the  European  Union,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  the  Government  of  Sweden,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF), the United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank. The \nmulti-donor trust fund has supported implementation of stages 1 and 2 of the PFMRP, including \nrevenue mobilization and the FMIS, but it is expected to end in July 2017 (para. 13). The European \nUnion  and  the  Government  of  Sweden,  previous  donors  to  the  multi-donor  trust  fund,  have \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2016.

The three outputs of the program combined are \nexpected to lead to more responsible aggregate fiscal balances (lower deficits and public debt), \nbetter resource allocation through improved prioritization, and greater operational efficiencies. \nPotential economic gains are to be achieved through resource allocation and efficiency gains \nby: (i) enhanced revenue mobilization; (ii) full implementation of the FMIS; (iii) introduction of a \ncomprehensive MTEF; and (iv) targeted systems and process oriented PFM reforms (para. 29).             \n  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The impact, which is aligned with the PFMRP, will be effective and efficient public \nservice delivery and inclusive growth. The outcome will be that the efficiency, effectiveness, and \naccountability of public expenditure and revenue management will be enhanced.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n19.  The proposed program will combine support for further development of the policy and \nregulatory framework led by MEF under stage 3 with the development of systems and capacities \nof selected line ministries to extend and deepen the implementation of reforms, along with \nenhancing external audit capacities. Subprograms 1 and 2 are structured around three outputs \nthat address the binding development constraints. Subprogram 1 has 18 completed policy \nactions implemented from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2016. Subprogram 2, which contains 21 \npolicy actions, is implemented from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019. Subprogram 1 includes an \nSDR2,501,000 TA loan to support implementation of subprogram 2 reform actions.  \n   \n1.   Output 1: Policy and Regulatory Framework for Expenditure and Revenue \nManagement Strengthened  \n \n20.  Policy and regulatory framework for budget\u2013policy links. This sub-output helped the \ngovernment  improve  the  policy  base  of  the  national  budget.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment adopted a new long-term strategy to reform the budget system and reaffirmed its \ncommitment  to  shift  from  an  input-based  and  centralized  system  to  a  results-based  and \ndevolved system. The consolidated action plan of stage 3 was approved by the government in \nMarch 2016. Budget circulars were prepared to help line ministries draft 3-year rolling BSPs that \nlink priority programs and actions with budgetary resources. The government also adopted a \nmedium-term revenue mobilization strategy targeting an increase in revenue of 0.5 percentage \npoints of GDP annually. Under subprogram 2, the Public Finance Management Systems Law \n(2008) will be amended to institutionalize PFM reforms. These will include a provision for the \nNational Assembly to pass the annual budget in a program budgeting format; development of a \ngovernment-wide  MTEF  for  2018\u20132020;  and  implementation  of  the  strategies  and  plans \nprepared under subprogram 1.      \n \n21.   Efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of expenditure management. This sub-\noutput supported policy actions that improved expenditure management and accountability. \nUnder subprogram 1, a new budget classification and chart of accounts were implemented with \nthe budget presentation in line with international standards. FMIS was developed and stage 1 \nimplementation started in MEF and its 25 provincial treasuries to automate budget execution, \n                                                \n16 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \naccounting, and financial reporting. Guidelines on policies and principles for internal controls for \nFMIS  were  adopted,  and  MEF  started  an  internal  audit  of  FMIS.  Under  subprogram  2, \ncomprehensive  financial  management  and  internal  audit  manuals  will  be  developed,  and \nimplementation of FMIS will progress and be rolled out to line ministries.       \n     \n22.  Sound public debt management system. This sub-output supported strengthening of \nthe public debt management system. Under subprogram 1, an updated public debt management \nstrategy  for  2015\u20132018  was  approved,  the  debt  recording  and  management  system  was \nupgraded  to  improve  portfolio  monitoring,  and  the  first  public  debt  statistical  bulletin  was \npublished  to  provide  trend  information  and  enhance the  evidence  base for  policy  makers. \nSubprogram 2 will include (i) development of guidelines on government guarantees, including \nguarantees on public\u2013private partnership projects, as well as operating procedures for public \ndebt management; (ii) a review of broader policy reforms, including the possible establishment \nof  a  domestic  market  in  public  debt  and  higher  quality  and  returns  from  debt-funded \ninvestments; and (iii) further strengthening of government\u2019s debt management capacity.               \n \n2.  Output 2: Capacity of Selected Line Ministries to Implement Budgeting and \nExpenditure Management Reforms Improved  \n \n23.  Capability of line ministries in budget formulation and execution strengthened. \nThis  sub-output  strengthened  the  capacities  of  selected  line  ministries  in  formulating  and \nimplementing their budgets. Under subprogram 1, all ministries prepared BSPs for 2016\u20132018. \nBudget entities were established and program budgeting increasingly implemented by 25 line \nministries to improve links between budgetary resources and program goals, and to better \nintegrate recurrent and capital budgets. Under subprogram 2, the BSPs will be updated with \npoverty covered annually and gender issues increasingly included; program budgeting will be \nfully  implemented  in  selected  line  ministries;  and financial  management  manuals for  budget \npreparation, execution, and reporting will be prepared. \n \n24.   Public financial management system at selected line ministries modernized. This \nsub-output improved expenditure management and accountability capacities in line ministries. \nUnder subprogram 1, 10 pilot line ministries (including the six ministries to be supported under \nthe proposed program) prepared preliminary annual financial reports in accordance with the \nplanned shift to program budgeting. Internal audit units were established in all government \nministries, providing a strong foundation for improving the integrity and quality of the whole PFM \nsystem. Subprogram 2 will support six line ministries  in (i) preparing annual financial and \nperformance reports in accordance with program budgeting; (ii) preparing FMIS implementation \nplans,  including  business  process  and  change-management  strategies;  and  (iii)  conducting \nperformance and information and communication technology  audits. The implementation of \nFMIS will pave the way for much-needed automation and modernization in line ministries.      \n \n3.  Output 3: Capacity of the External Audit Function Improved  \n             \n25.  This output further developed the external audit capacity of the NAA and reinforced the \nintegrity of the PFM system. Under subprogram 1, a regulation to implement the Audit Law was \napproved. NAA\u2019s annual report for 2015 was also approved. The annual audit reports of the \npublic finance statements were submitted to the National Assembly within 4 months of receipt \nfrom  MEF  for  both  FY2013  and  FY2014,  and  were  published  on  NAA\u2019s  website.  Under \nsubprogram 2, guidelines on financial, compliance, and performance audits will be updated; a \nmanual on conducting audits of subnational administrations (districts) will be completed; and \naudits  of  at  least  10  districts  will  be  conducted.  In  coordination  with  support  from  the \n ", "8 \nGovernment of Sweden, NAA\u2019s new strategic plan for 2017\u20132021 will be prepared and attention \nto the timely production of annual audit reports continued. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs  \n \n26.  Cambodia\u2019s gross financing needs remain high. In 2016, with a budget deficit target of \n4.6% of GDP, the government will need to borrow about $820 million. The IMF analysis of debt \nsustainability in November 2015 found Cambodia at low risk of debt distress. To support its \nreforms,  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR18,939,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan \nwill have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an annual interest rate of 1% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. The loan will be withdrawn in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness \nand used to finance foreign exchange costs of economy-wide imports, excluding ineligible items \nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). The loan closing date is \n30 June 2017. A loan of $30 million has been programed for 2019 to finance subprogram 2. The \nloan size is based on the financing needs of the government, the strength of the policy reform \npackage, and its development impact. The government is committed to meeting the full costs of \nthe reforms, which are estimated at $114.7 million in 2013 prices (para. 29).  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  MEF is the executing agency for the program. The General Secretariat of the PFM \nReform Steering Committee is responsible for overall coordination of program implementation.17 \nMEF\u2019s Department of Information Technology, General Department of Budget (including the \nDepartment of Cooperation and Debt Management), General Department of Internal Audit, and \nthe PFM reform working groups in the selected ministries are the implementing agencies for \noutputs 1 and 2. The Secretary General of the PFM Reform Steering Committee is the program \ndirector and is responsible for outputs 1 and 2. As an independent institution, the NAA is the \nimplementing agency for output 3 and will sign a project agreement with ADB. The NAA\u2019s \nauditor general is the project manager for output 3. Implementation and fund flow arrangements \nare in the project administration manual (PAM).18 \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n28.  The  government  has  requested  a  TA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR2,501,000 from ADB's Special Funds resources to be implemented over 3 years to support \nthe reforms under subprogram 2.19 MEF is the executing agency. The TA loan will finance \nconsulting services, including applicable taxes and duties, bank charges, workshops, seminars, \ntraining, and project management support expenses. The TA loan will have a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an annual interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft TA loan agreement. \nThe TA loan will be implemented from 1 February 2017 to 30 September 2019, with the \nexpected closing date on 31 March 2020. The government will provide in-kind contributions in \nthe form of counterpart staff and various facilities. The TA loan financing plan and investment \nplan are summarized in part IV of the PAM. Goods will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n17 The PFM Reform Steering Committee is an interministerial body chaired by Minister of MEF.  \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Attached Technical Assistance Loan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), and consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n29.  Implementation of the proposed program between 2014 and 2019 is estimated to create \ncumulative net benefits of $1.18 billion (2013 constant prices) from 2014 to 2024. This is based \non estimates of a program impact assessment of cumulative benefits of $1.29 billion (2013 \nconstant prices). Benefits are estimated to come from the following agreed policy actions: (i) the \nrevenue mobilization strategy ($739.5 million), (ii) movement to FMIS commissioning ($259.6 \nmillion), (iii) introduction of strategic medium-term budgeting through an MTEF ($77.1 million), \nand  (iv)  selected  strategic,  systems  and  process  oriented  reforms  ($213.7  million). \nImplementation of the proposed program reforms between 2014 and 2019 is estimated to cost \n$114.7 million (2013 constant prices), mainly for implementing the FMIS, line ministries\u2019 self-\nfunded support for PFM reforms, and MEF budget support to line ministries. Given the medium-\nto long-term nature of benefit flows and government long-term commitment to PFM reforms, \nimplementation of the proposed program is assessed to be sustainable over the longer term. 20 \n \nB.  Governance \n30.   As PFM systems are being developed in procurement and anticorruption environments \nthat are still fragile, program implementation faces fiduciary risks. However, Cambodia has \nsignificant  experience  with  budget  support  loans,  and  fiduciary  arrangements  have  been \ngradually improved to ensure that funds are used effectively and efficiently. Mitigating measures \nfocus on supporting implementation of the PFMRP, as reflected in the proposed policy matrix \n(including improvements in budgeting, internal controls, internal and external audit, and FMIS \nimplementation). These measures and the implementation of decentralization reforms supported \nby  ADB  under  a  separate  but  complementary  program,  including  clearer  assignments  of \nfunctions  and  strengthening  of  PFM  systems,  have  sought  to  overcome  weaknesses  and \nfiduciary  risks  associated  with  policy-based  lending.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the executing and \nimplementing agencies.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social  \n31.  Although Cambodia achieved consistently high economic growth rates from 2007 to \n2015, poverty remains a challenge. Social development and poverty reduction will be achieved \nmainly through improved and more efficient public services; higher-quality budget allocations \nlinking policy and budgets; increasing inclusion of poverty and gender priorities in line ministries\u2019 \nprogram budgets; and overall improvements in effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability of \npublic expenditures. The program is categorized as containing some gender elements. The TA \nloan will support capacity development in line ministries in order to include gender and poverty \nreduction interventions in their BSPs and program budgets.21 \n                                                \n20 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2).    \n21 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n32.  The program and TA loans are category C for involuntary resettlement, environment, and \nindigenous people\u2019s safeguards as no impacts are expected in these areas.  \n  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Overall risks for subprogram 1 and the TA loan are assessed as medium. The major \nrisks are (i) low PFM capacities, including an insufficient number of PFM-trained officials, (ii) a \nslowdown in reforms because of commune and national elections in 2017 and 2018, (iii) slower \ngrowth and unfavorable fiscal outcomes caused by external shocks, (iv) limited  internal controls \nand  internal  audit,  (v)  weak  internal  and  external  reporting,  and  (vi)  weak  external  audit \ncapacity. The elections risks are mitigated by scheduling approval of subprogram 2 in 2019, well \nafter the elections. Mitigation of all other medium-level risks will be addressed through policy \nreforms under the proposed program and PFMRP, as well as by capacity building under the TA \nloan. A risk assessment and risk management plan will be implemented to overcome fiduciary \nrisks in implementing the TA loan. The integrated benefits and impacts of the proposed program \nare expected to outweigh the costs.  \n   \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n34.  The government and the MEF have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Strengthening Public Financial Management  \nProgram; \n(ii)  the policy-based loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR18,939,000 to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 1 of the Strengthening Public Financial \nManagement Program, from ADB's Special Funds resources, with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \n(iii)  the technical assistance loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2,501,000 \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Strengthening  Public \nFinancial Management Program, from ADB's Special Funds resources, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft technical assistance loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n5 September 2016 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \n DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nEffective and efficient public service delivery and inclusive growth (Public Financial Management \nReform Program, 2005\u20132025)a \n      Data \nResults  Performance Indicators with Targets and  Sources and   \nChain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome      Commune and \nnational \nThe efficiency,  By 2020   \nelections in \neffectiveness, \nImprovement in PEFA assessment ratings of the  2015 and  2017 and \nand \nfollowing key summary PFM areas:   2020 PEFA  2018 slow \naccountability \n(i)  Budget credibility: from C+ (2015) to B.  reports.  reforms. \nof public \n(ii)  Budget policy linkages: from C+ (2015) to \nexpenditure    External \nB. \nand revenue  shocks \n(iii) Financial accountability: from C (2015) to \nmanagement  weaken \nC+. \nenhanced.  growth and \n(iv) External audit: from D+ (2010) to C. \nfiscal \noutcomes, \nhampering \nreforms. \nOutputs  Subprogram 1 (by 30 June 2016)     \n \n1.
