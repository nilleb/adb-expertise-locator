During the 2005 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of Bangladesh confirmed its request for assistance to prepare the Dhaka Water \nSupply Project. In May 2005, ADB fielded a mission to hold meetings with the government \nagencies concerned, the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA), external \nfunding agencies, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The status of Dhaka\u2019s water \nsupply was ascertained through a review of (i) the history of the water supply, (ii) ongoing \nprojects,  (iii)  existing  and  future  gaps  between  supply  and  demand,  and  (iv)  the  planned \ndevelopment program. The Government and ADB agreed that technical assistance (TA) would \nbe provided in 2005. The TA Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from 26 July to 4 August 2005. \nThe Mission\u2019s findings were presented to the Government at a wrap-up meeting on 3 August \n2005.  The  Government  concurs  with  the  TA  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the consultants.1 A \npreliminary design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Dhaka\u2019s population is about 12 million and is growing at an estimated annual rate of over \n5%.  The  city  is  characterized  by  unplanned  expansion,  with  large  squatter  settlements  in \ndifferent parts of the metropolitan area. This has burdened an already inadequate infrastructure \nand  caused  environmental  problems  associated  with  insufficient  water  supply,  sanitation, \ndrainage, and urban flood protection. Deficiencies in water supply and sanitation services have \nresulted in higher costs for businesses, slower urban economic growth, and social unrest. To \nmeet the growing demand for water, DWASA installs deep tube wells every year. The rate of \nwater extraction from existing aquifers and the declining level of groundwater (para. 5) are \nalarming  and,  if  unabated,  will  cause  serious  shortages,  land  subsidence,  and  further \nenvironmental degradation. \n \n3.  External funding agencies are interested in cofinancing or financing on a parallel basis \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  projects  for  Dhaka.  The  Danish  International  Development \nAssistance (Danida) and the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) are considering \nfunding, through mixed credits, (i) the relocation of the intake and doubling of the capacity of the \nexisting surface water treatment plant at Saidabad; and (ii) rehabilitation and leak detection. The \nWorld Bank has initiated assistance to DWASA in (i) wastewater management, (ii) storm water \ndrainage, (iii) water supply and sanitation services to low-income communities, (iv) social and \nenvironmental safeguards, and (v) DWASA performance improvement plan. For components \n(iii)  and  (v),  close  coordination  will  take  place  between  the  World  Bank  and  ADB.  The \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) of UK is considering providing grant financing \nto  DWASA  for  slum  improvements  or  institutional  development.  The  Government  of  the \nNetherlands has shown interest in funding twinning arrangements with a water supply company \nin the Netherlands, for which \u20ac1.0 million may be available over 4 years. The Government of \nJapan is actively supporting Chittagong WASA and has expressed its willingness to assist \nDWASA, subject to the water authority\u2019s satisfactory capacity building.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Lack of Adequate Water Supply. DWASA estimates2 that it serves safe water supply to \nabout 75% of the population in Dhaka. The number of people who receive piped water in their \nhomes  is  estimated  to  be  5.5  million,  of  which  75%  obtain  24-hour  supply  and  25%  an \nintermittent supply. Another 500,000 have access to piped water via stand posts. An additional \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 19 July 2005. \n2  All the WASA estimates regarding the existing water supplies, coverage and service level, and overall water \ndemand are subject to confirmation in the field.  \n ", "2     \n3 million people who live in slums obtain bulk supply of water from the DWASA pipe network. \nThe remaining 3 million people receive water from their own supply systems. This includes large \nprivate apartment complexes and industries, who pay DWASA a fee. \n \n5.  Dhaka is facing an estimated water shortage of about 500 million liters per day (mld)\u2014\nover 25% of the existing demand. It is estimated this will increase to 1,500 mld in 2015 if no \nadditional sources are developed. About 82% of the existing water supply is from groundwater \nresources and 18% from surface water. The large-scale abstraction of groundwater and severe \ngroundwater mining has led to a continuous falling of groundwater levels. For example, water \nlevels in Dhanmondi area fell from about 20 meters in the 1980s to 28 meters now. To cope with \nthis problem, DWASA has been drilling new deep tube wells, which now number 400, from 140 \nin 1990. However, this has resulted in the drying up of several existing wells at a rate faster than \npreviously. Because of the falling water table and erratic electricity supply, even the functioning \ntube wells cannot be operated at their full potential. The situation is further exacerbated by large \nnonrevenue water (NRW), which includes technical and administrative losses.3 Serious water \nshortages have caused civil opposition, which is now becoming the focus of media coverage. \nThere is an urgent need to (i) address, as a top priority, the issue of NRW through specific \nstructural and nonstructural measures; (ii) develop additional sources for water supply; and \n(iii) rehabilitate the existing tube wells and distribution network based on technical justification \nand proper master planning. Since Dhaka has an annual rainfall of about 1,500 mm, rainwater \nharvesting is a possibility which, together with above measures, would help address the existing \nshortage.  \n \n6.  Poor Water Quality. The majority of the distribution system is weak because of the \nintermittent water supply, leakage, and pollution from old and dilapidated sewerage pipes and \nstorm drains. As a result, the incidence of waterborne diseases like diarrhea and typhoid is \nfound among city dwellers. According to DWASA, arsenic problems in Dhaka have not been \nreported, but iron concentration in the water is common from aquifers of about 150 meters deep. \nA  comprehensive  sampling  and  analysis  program  is  needed  to  determine  baseline  quality \nlevels, to be followed by (i) the necessary study and action to ensure quality, (ii) monitoring, and \n(iii) rectification, if any. \n \n7.  Institutional Weaknesses and Financial Sustainability. DWASA is struggling with \nserious operational problems. It is in need of a structured organizational development. The \nmechanism  for  tariff  revision  needs  to  be  rationalized  to  allow  DWASA  to  implement  the \nGovernment\u2019s water policy without referring to higher authorities. DWASA has already initiated \naction  with  regard  to  consumer  surveys  and  collection  efficiency.  The  Institute  of  Water \nModelling (IWM) is undertaking a study on \u201cResource Assessment and Monitoring of Water \nSupply Sources for Dhaka City\u201d, which, by December 2005, is expected clearly to define the \npath to be taken in water source development. It is also undertaking a \u201cDevelopment of GIS \nbased MIS System, Network Analysis and Metering\u201d, which will provide the tools to improve the \noperational efficiency of DWASA. \n  \n8.  Unauthorized connections, leaks in the system, inadequate operation and maintenance, \npoor quality of metering and meter reading, and underbilling have led to huge NRW. On top of \nthis, low collection efficiency has increased receivables to around 13 months, which is extremely \nhigh by any standard. There is a need to (i) register all the illegal consumers into the consumer \ndatabase to help improve revenues; (ii) conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing tariffs \n                                                 \n3 Technical losses include leaks from the pipelines and connection points, and administrative losses include illegal \nconnections due to theft and pilferage from the system. According to a study for DWASA on an \u201cImmediate action \nprogramme to reduce unaccounted for water\u201d carried out in 1995/96, the estimated technical losses are 21% and \nadministrative losses are 31%. \n ", "        3\nand estimate the appropriate water tariffs to cover costs associated with efficient water delivery; \nand (iii) build a sound financial management capacity in billing, collection, accounting, and \nbudgeting. Based on lessons learned on earlier projects, DWASA\u2019s financial and managerial \nauthority  need  to  be  expanded  to  allow  it  to  recover  outstanding  dues  from  government \nagencies,  if  any,  without  political  interference.  Critical  institutional  reforms  and  the  active \nparticipation of the private sector are essential for future investments. In Dhaka, water services \nsuffer from, among others, underinvestment, overstaffing, low pay, and limited availability of \nequipment. To rectify these deficiencies, the Government is trying to attract the private sector to \nthe  utility  services.  Of  the  options  for  private  sector  participation,  DWASA  has  chosen  to \ncontract out the billing and collection of three of its eight water supply zones to the DWASA \nEmployees\u2019 Consumers Supplies Co-operative Society Limited. This move has contributed to a \nmarked improvement in the volume of billing and collection of revenues, was found to be cost-\neffective, and has resulted in some opportunity gains to DWASA. DWASA now plans to contract \nout,  in  phases,  the  remaining  zones  to  private  operators.  Based  on  this,  private  sector \ninvolvement should now increase in other areas of DWASA activities, including operation and \nmaintenance of water supply and sewerage services. \n \n9.  The ADB mission in May 2005 presented to the Government a strategy and program for \npossible  ADB  assistance  following  a  two-pronged  approach:  (i)  providing  the  priority \ninfrastructure  to  address  the  urgent  demand;  and  (ii)  bringing  effective  institutional  and \ngovernance  improvements,  keeping  in  mind  the  lessons  learned  from  similar  projects  in \nBangladesh.  The  Government  has  endorsed  the  strategy  and  accepted  that  ADB\u2019s  future \nassistance would be subject to a satisfactory commitment from the Government in connection \nwith institutional and governance improvements, and appropriate attention to water supply for \nthe urban poor.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The Project\u2019s purpose is to improve living conditions and quality of life of people living in \nDhaka, where water quality and access are serious issues. The Project will help DWASA \nimprove safe water supplies, and develop its management for effective and sustainable delivery \nof services. The TA will prepare a project suitable for ADB financing, and will include (i) the \nimplementation of the zonal approach pilot testing (para. 11); (ii) surveys for the rehabilitation \nneeds for tube wells and distribution system in all zones; (iii) finalization of the short-, medium-, \nand long-term solutions to augment water supplies based on the outcome of the ongoing study \non \u201cResource Assessment and Monitoring of Water Supply Sources for Dhaka City\u201d (para. 7); \n(iv) preparation of water supply master plans, including the plans for 24-hour supply to all zones \nof  Dhaka;  (v)  preparation  of  recommendations  for  urgent  action  regarding  the  institutional \ncapacity building and staff development of DWASA, and enhancing public\u2013private partnerships \nto ensure the sustainability of the planned interventions. The TA will provide the overall project \ndesign, scope, cost, financing plan, and implementation arrangements, and will formulate the \nterms of reference for consultants.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  the  proposed  strategy  for  the  development  and \nmanagement of Dhaka water supply. The key elements are (i) a transparent government policy \nreflecting equitable service levels and tariffs to affect full cost recovery, and (ii) the active \nparticipation of civil society to monitor the implementation of Government policy.  \n \n ", "4     \n12.  To prepare and finalize the government policy, a comprehensive water services survey \nwas conducted from June to July 2005 with ADB assistance. The findings will be presented in a \nstakeholder consultation in late September 2005, at which the policy will be defined and the civil \nsociety monitoring team constituted. The Government guaranteed that this policy would be \napproved by mid-November 2005. To demonstrate civil society\u2019s active participation, it has been \nagreed by the Government of Bangladesh that a zonal approach\u2014initially involving a small, \nhydraulically  isolated  pilot  area  under  the  water  supply  distribution\u2014would  be  adopted. \nResources  will  be  concentrated  to  make  the  pilot  area  100%  efficient.  All  unauthorized \nconnections will be identified, legalized, and metered; defective meters of registered consumers \nreplaced; and all leaks rectified to achieve zero level of NRW. It is envisaged that 100% \ncollection efficiency can be achieved with the active participation of communities and civil \nsociety. By raising service levels and its management to an acceptable level, the new approach \nis  expected  to  work.  The  project  design  will  include  preparing  detailed  proposals  for  the \nreplication of this pilot to all other parts of Dhaka. For this purpose, the TA will include (i) \ncomprehensive surveys to identify and design the rehabilitation needs of the water supply \nsystem in all zones, and (ii) updating of the consumers database.  \n \n13.  The TA will also finalize (i) the master planning of Dhaka water supply, including the \nfeasibility of new water sources based on the outcome and recommendations of the studies \nundertaken by IWM; (ii) advanced action on contract documents for the development of water \nsources based on the design, build, and operate contract arrangement, and detailed designs for \ntube well rehabilitation and distribution improvement; and (iii) the work plan for the institutional \ndevelopment of DWASA, in collaboration with the active external funding agencies.   \n \n14.  Project  interventions  will  give  priority  to  low-income  communities  and  schools  with \ninadequate water supply. The Project will be prepared using community participation, including \nwomen\u2019s groups, and be implemented, wherever feasible and appropriate, by civil society, \nnongovernment and community-based organizations. The summary initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The  TA  consultants  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  organization  development  of \nDWASA  that  will  consider  (i)  staff  members\u2019  qualifications  and  skills;  (ii)  procedures  of \noperations, accountability, and incentives to perform; and (iii) training on technical operations, \nand financial governance and management. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, comprising $532,400 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $717,600  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  (Appendix  3).  ADB  will \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $467,600 equivalent of the local currency cost, \ntotaling $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The  Government  will  provide  $250,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  remuneration  of \ncounterpart  staff,  provision  of  office  accommodation  and  facilities,  local  transportation  for \ncounterpart staff, surveys, procurement of goods for the pilot zone, which include water meters \nand pipes, and additional support to IWM to complete the studies by December 2005. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  DWASA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Important issues will be placed before \nthe DWASA board for its consideration.  \n \n ", "        5\n18.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months from December 2005 to August 2006. \nConsulting  services  total  115  person-months:  22  international  and  93  domestic.  With  the \nexception of the international financial management specialist and environment specialist, an \ninternational firm will be engaged to organize the TA activities. The consultants will be engaged \nby ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A simplified technical proposal \nwith the quality and cost-based selection method will be used to select the international firm. \nThe international firm will contract reputed NGOs or private groups to conduct baseline survey, \nawareness, and social mobilization. The consultants may procure equipment through direct \npurchase  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Upon  TA  completion, \nownership of the equipment procured under TA will be transferred to DWASA. The outline terms \nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  The consultants\u2019 reporting requirements include (i) detailed team and individual work \nplans within a week after mobilization, (ii) a draft feasibility report within 26 weeks, (iii) a final \nreport within 30 weeks of TA commencement incorporating comments on the draft feasibility \nreport from the Government and ADB, and (iv) tender documents of the selected contracts \nwithin 37 weeks. Tripartite meetings involving the Government, ADB, and the consultants will be \nheld within 2 weeks after the mobilization of consultants, and following the submission of the \ndraft feasibility report. \n \n20.  The consumer survey in the pilot zone has been completed. The Government has \ncommitted to implementing the agreed action plan of activities (Supplementary Appendix A) \nstrictly in accordance with the agreed time frame.  \n \n21.  To expedite the ongoing GIS/MIS development by IWM, which is the key to the timely \ncompletion of the TA, DWASA agreed to form a special team in each zone to verify the \ncomputerized network data as it becomes available from IWM. This will ensure the completion \nof the work by 31 December 2005, as scheduled.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for preparing the Dhaka Water Supply Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting   Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanism  and Risks \n     \nImpact       Assumptions \n\u2022 Percentage of the  Annual report of economic  \u2022 Political and socioeconomic \nIncrease household \npopulation in absolute  survey, the Government  conditions remain stable  \nincome and improve \npoverty reduced     \nhealth, particularly of poor \ncommunities, in the  \u2022 Monthly medical  Annual Bangladesh resident  \u2022 Government\u2019s commitment \nproject areas.  expenditures per  mission report on Bangladesh  to the timely completion of \nhousehold reduced   economic update  the Project remains. \n \n \nOutcome  \u2022 Improved access to  Annual report of economic  Assumptions \n  economic and social  survey, Government  \u2022 Competent Government staff \nImprove living conditions  services    continue to be available for \nin the city by improving  \u2022 Maternal deaths  Hospital reports  management, design, and \nwater quality and access,  reduced     supervision \nand develop management  \u2022 Safe and reliable  Health management   \nof DWASA for effective  drinking water provided  information system   \u2022 Competent contractors are \nand sustainable delivery  in all the zones of    available, and competitive \nof services.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nRapid urbanization and steady rural-urban migration of the poor in search of employment and economic opportunities is \ninflating the urban population in Bangladesh. Results obtained from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey \n2000a indicated an increase in urban poverty from 29.5% in 1995/96 to 36.6% in 2000. Around 25% of the country\u2019s \npopulation lives in urban areas, and the majority of them fall in the poor and low income category. Thus, reducing \nvulnerability and providing safer living environment with basic facilities in the urban areas is important. According to the \nsurvey, only 32.06% of the urban households had access to drinking water supply and, 66.93% were dependent on tube \nwell water. Supply of safe water is essential in reducing the vulnerability of the poor, particularly in reducing diseases \nand improving health.  \n \nDhaka city, the capital and center of all economic and administrative activities in Bangladesh, attracts migrants from all \nover the country. It is the most populous city in the country with a population of about 12 million, and a density of more \nthan 5,000 persons per square km. In the Dhaka metropolitan area, at least 5 million people live below the poverty line \nand the majority of them are residents of mostly shanty and squatter settlements of the low-lying areas or vacant lands. \nThese settlements with a population of low-income groups lack urban infrastructural facilities like paved roads, water, \nsanitation, sewerage, and waste disposal system. There are over 4,500 slum and squatter settlements and the total \nnumber of households in these settlements was estimated at 112,670 and 8,250 respectively, accommodating more \nthan 1.1 million poor according to a survey by Coalition for Urban Poor in 2003. According to Dhaka Water Supply and \nSewerage Authority (DWASA), it serves safe water supply to about 75% percent of the city\u2019s population and the deficit of \nwater stands about 500 million liters per day. As a result, people, particularly those in poor areas and low income \ncommunities (accounting for 25% the population), receive water legally or illegally and pay high fees to various \nstakeholders. Use of unsafe water makes them prone to diseases. In some areas of the city, the health-related \nexpenditure is high because of polluted water. Moreover, Dhaka faces flooding during monsoon, often due to blockage \nof sewerage and drains. Damage of water infrastructure, leakage, and water clogging during monsoon leads to scarcity \nof safe water and increased suffering of the low-income groups and residents of the low-lying areas\u2014making their living \nconditions deplorable.   \n \nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) emphasized the need for safe water. One of the seven-point strategic \nagenda of the NPRS is water and sanitation. The goal of NPRS is to reduce the number of people who do not have \naccess to safe water (26%) by half in 2006 and to reduce water pollution. One of the supporting strategies is effective \ndelivery of services through public-private partnership. Improving water supply infrastructure in urban areas and \nensuring quality services were identified as prerequisites for hygiene and nutrition, and contributes to poverty reduction \nby reducing health risks and creating employment. The NPRS also envisages introducing water supply projects for all \nurban areas and monitoring water quality. The water supply programs need to focus on providing basic services and the \nparticipation of private and public sectors, in collaboration with strengthened local government institutions.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to ensure safe water supply to the \nurban population. ADB has supported six development projects for secondary towns in Bangladesh since the 1980s. \nThe proposed technical assistance project to be implemented by DWASA is expected to (i) design a project to help find \nshort-, medium- and long-term improvement in the water supply situation in Dhaka metropolitan city area, (ii) prepare a \nmaster plan, and (iii) design appropriate public-private partnership interventions to ensure quality services and access of \nthe poor to safe water. Partnerships with civil society, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and community-based \norganizations will be assessed to significantly contribute to reducing urban poverty and consolidate the gains made so \nfar in the area. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis     Targeting Classification:  Targeted intervention \nPoverty Analysis: The TA will undertake a detailed poverty analysis. During the TA, survey data will be required to \nestimate access of various urban groups to drinking water facilities, modes of water delivery, time spent by women and \nchildren in collecting water, estimated cost of various modes by area, affordability of water for low income groups, \ncapacity of DWASA to serve the poor, and direct and indirect poverty impact of the services. Limited-size (qualitative \nand quantitative) survey data will be combined with available more comprehensive data sets.  \n \nDuring the feasibility study, the channels of effect need to be identified, to: (i) see how costs will be incurred and benefits \nrealized, (ii) identify gains from distributing project effects; (iii) determine how much cost burden can be acceptable to \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nthose who will pay, (iv) identify overall project performance and returns on equity consideration, and (v) identify \nmodifications of project design and components to enhance impact on target beneficiaries. \n \n \nC.

Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIn Dhaka city, women and the homeless make up a large proportion of the population. The TA will analyze the needs, \nand suggest means to address gender concerns in activities related to the development of water supply facilities, \noperation and maintenance, delivery of services, collection, and use at household levels. The TA will recommend ways \nfor the Project to create scope for women\u2019s participation in project activities, from participatory project planning to \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. It will recommend how to generate employment opportunities for women by \ninvolving  them  in  different  activities.  The  role  of  local  government,  especially  of  female  ward  commissioners \nrepresentatives in participatory service delivery and promotion of women\u2019s involvement in various activities will be \nexamined and recommendations made.   \n \nHas an output been prepared?
