INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested policy and \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA) from the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) to  assist  the \nXiangtan Municipal Government (XMG) in strengthening its capacity to address climate change \nand pursue low-carbon development (LCD). A TA fact-finding mission on 1\u20133 February 2015 \nreached an agreement with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA consulting \nservices. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Urbanization has been a key driver of economic development in the PRC for the last 35 \nyears. The PRC's urbanization ratio increased from 19.4% in 1978 to 53.7% in 2013. From 1978 \nto 2013, the number of cities rose from 193 to 658, and the number of townships from 2,173 to \n20,113. 2  Urbanization  and  industrialization  have  caused  environmental  degradation  and \npollution, limiting future options for sustainable urbanization in the PRC. Increasing air pollution \nand high labor costs in the eastern region of the PRC, coupled with the western development \ninitiatives, have led to a shift of manufacturing from large coastal cities to small- and medium-\nsized cities in the central and western regions. These cities, which possess an abundance of \nlabor and resources, tend to attract high-energy and pollution-heavy processing industries. \nWhile these industries allow for short-term economic growth, they ultimately sacrifice the long-\nterm and environment-friendly development of these cities. Under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, \n2006\u20132010,  the  government  set  a  goal  to  build  a  \u201ctwo-oriented  society\u201d  that  will  be  both \nresource-conserving  and  environment-friendly.3 This  strategic  task  is  critical  for  long-term \nplanning for the national economy and social development. \n \n3.  Meanwhile, the PRC is becoming increasingly aware of the challenges posed by climate \nchange to its continued development. Since the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, the PRC\u2019s \nclimate change initiatives include (i) implementing an action plan to control greenhouse gas \nemissions, (ii) adjusting the country\u2019s industrial structure and saving energy, (iii) increasing \nenergy efficiency, (iv) optimizing the country\u2019s energy structure and increasing carbon sinks, \nand  (v)  adapting  to  climate  change  and  intensifying  capability  building.4 This  has  led  to \nsignificant progress; in 2013 carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) \nwere 4.3% lower than in 2012, and 28.56% lower than in 2005, equivalent to a cumulative \nreduction  of  2.5  billion  tons  of  carbon  dioxide.  Environmental  protection  measures  are \nanticipated in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020. \n \n4.  The government sees urbanization as an opportunity to expand economic growth while \npromoting pollution-free and resource-efficient LCD. In 2013, ADB completed a policy and \nadvisory TA, which aimed to assist the government in strengthening the capacity of small- and \nmedium-sized cities to address climate change and pursue LCD through knowledge sharing.5 \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30   July 2015. \n2  World Bank. 2015.

Manila. \n ", "2 \n \nThe  TA  output  alerted  the  government  and  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC) that low-carbon urban development of small- and medium-sized cities \nwill  face  significant  challenges,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  financing,  knowledge,  human \nresources, regulation, and infrastructure. The TA also identified national and international best \npractices best suited for small- and medium-sized cities in the PRC. Meanwhile, the NDRC \nidentified 36 cities to undertake a wide range of pilot LCD tasks, such as developing citywide \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories, setting measurable emission reduction targets, \ndeveloping low-carbon action plans, and establishing performance tracking mechanisms.6 \n \n5.  In 2014, the government requested an additional policy and advisory TA from ADB to \nbuild on previous findings and apply the lessons learned in Xiangtan, Hunan Province. With a \npopulation of approximately 1 million, Xiangtan is a medium-sized city within the Changsha\u2013\nZhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan city cluster, which was established in 2007 as one of the only two city cluster \npilots aimed at exploring sustainable economic and social development in the PRC. Xiangtan \nwas selected due to its size, location, and historical importance, as well as its existing political \ncommitment to environmental improvement despite heavy industrialization.7 While Xiangtan has \nmade many efforts to advance local green and LCD initiatives such as closing many chemical \nplants that were polluting the Xiang River, it is not one of the 36 pilot LCD cities selected by the \nNDRC.  The XMG  has very  broad  pollution  reduction targets,  which  aim  to  lower  both  air \npollution and carbon emission, but at this time, comprehensive GHG data from Xiangtan is not \navailable. XMG has requested guidance in measuring existing emissions and supporting the \ncreation of a goal and workplan to ensure that international best practices are used to create a \nreplicable model for small- and medium-sized cities in the PRC. While the LCD initiatives affect \nmultiple sectors, the XMG has prioritized LCD planning for industrial development as Xiangtan\u2019s \nmost urgent need. The proposed TA is a timely response to the government\u2019s request for ADB \nassistance to identify suitable policies and mechanisms to promote LCD in small- and medium-\nsized cities in the PRC.8 The TA could also build on the ongoing PRC initiative, particularly \ndevelopment of the GHG accounting and monitoring framework. The TA also aims to identify \ninnovative approaches to LCD projects in Xiangtan, which could lead to potential ADB lending. \n \n6.  The proposed TA aims to help XMG to promote energy efficiency and decrease carbon \nemissions per capita GDP in Xiangtan. Considering the existing lack of local carbon emission \ndata, this will be achieved by two parallel work tracks, one focusing on GHG emissions and the \nother on the macro level of urban LCD planning. The first track will include the (i) creation of an \n                                                \n6  The  NDRC  identified  the  pilot  cities  in  two  batches.  The  first,  selected  in  2010,  included  five  provinces \n(Guangdong, Hubei, Liaoning, Shanxi, and Yunnan), two municipalities (Chongqing and Tianjin), and six cities \n(Baoding, Guiyang, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Shenzhen, and Xiamen). The second batch, selected in 2012, included \nHainan Province, two municipalities  (Beijing and Shanghai), and 26 cities (Chizhou, Daxinganling, Ganzhou, \nGuangyuan, Guangzhou, Guilin, Huaian, Hulunbeier, Jinchang, Jincheng, Jingdezhen, Jinlin, Jiyuan, Kunming, \nNanping, Ningbo, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Shijiazhuang, Suzhou, Urumqi, Wenzhou, Wuhan, Yanan, Zhenjiang, \nand Zunyi).  \n7  ADB. 2012.

These two TA projects helped the Hunan Provincial \nGovernment  mainstream  climate  technology  into  development  and  promote  advanced  climate  technology \ninvestment by engaging the private sector. The outputs of these two TA projects can provide a foundation and \nuseful input for the proposed TA. \n8  ADB. 2014.

These two TA projects have supported LCD in the PRC. \nLessons learned from these TA projects can provide useful input for the proposed TA.  \n ", "3 \n \ninventory of current Xiangtan GHG emissions across all major sectors and (ii) the establishment \nof a GHG monitoring and accounting system.  The second track, which will be informed by the \nresults of the first track will include the creation of (i) an LCD index system for Xiangtan to \nmeasure LCD and environmentally friendly development; and (ii) a Xiangtan LCD strategy and \nimplementation plan (LCD Road Map for Xiangtan), which could be used by similar small- and \nmedium-sized cities in the PRC. Carbon emission measurements and reduction targets for all \ntasks will be measured against national standards (footnote 4). \n \n7.  The TA is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities  as outlined in the Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020, as well as with environmentally sustainable growth, the strategic pillar \nof ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2011\u20132015 for the PRC. By supporting the PRC\u2019s efforts \nto promote resource conservation, emission reduction, and environmental protection, this TA is \nfully aligned with ADB\u2019s Environment Operational Directions, 2013\u20132020 and Urban Operational \nPlan, 2012\u20132020.9 The TA is also consistent with (i) the priorities of the government's Twelfth \nFive-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  (footnote  4);  (ii)  the  PRC\u2019s  emphasis  on  achieving  ecological \ncivilization  and  commitment  to  curbing  costs  associated  with  resource  depletion  and \nenvironmental damage (as announced at the Third Plenum);10 and (iii) the recently proclaimed \nconcept of \u201cgreenization\u201d of production, economy, and lifestyle.11 \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The intended TA impacts will be (i) decreased carbon emission per capita GDP, and (ii) \ndecreased energy consumption per unit of GDP in Xiangtan. The outcome of the TA will be an \nLCD model for Xiangtan that is recognized as an example for other small- and medium-sized \ncities in the PRC.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA outputs will follow and be informed by internationally accepted and nationally \nappropriate methodologies.12 The TA will have four outputs contributing towards the outcome \nand impact. \n \n10.  Output 1 will be an inventory of current Xiangtan GHG emissions across all major urban \nsectors (industry, transportation, building, and energy). This will entail (i) an investigation of the \nsources and quantities of GHG in Xiangtan by sector; and (ii) an assessment of policies and \ncurrent  practices  of  GHG  management  at  the  city,  province,  and  regional  levels.  The \nassessment of relevant PRC policies, practices, and perceptions will be conducted through a \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014.

GHG Accounting Tool for Chinese Cities. http://www.ghgprotocol.org/chinese-\ncity-tool; Atkins. Eco-Low Carbon Urban Planning Methodology. http://www.atkinsglobal.com/en-GB/group/sectors-\nand-services/services/future-proofing-cities/china \n ", "4 \n \nliterature  review  and  survey  questionnaires  of  practitioners,  academia,  and  professional \nassociations. The results will be presented in a working paper as a GHG emissions baseline. \n \n11.  Output 2 will be a GHG monitoring and accounting system for Xiangtan. This will entail \nthe creation of an appropriate, continuous data measurement and analysis system, as well as \ntraining for the XMG. The GHG monitoring system is expected to be subsumed within the \nbroader LCD system when the latter is developed. \n \n12.  Output 3 will be an LCD index system for Xiangtan to measure LCD and environmentally \nfriendly development. This will entail (i) identification of national and international good practices \nin LCD and air pollution reduction, (ii) identification of options for development with expected \nGHG  emission  reduction  impact,  and  (iii)  creation  of  a  grading  system  to  rate  possible \ndevelopment outcomes. The results will be presented in a policy note on the LCD index system \nfor Xiangtan. \n \n \n13.  Output 4 will be a Xiangtan LCD strategy and implementation plan that can be used by \nsimilar small- and medium-sized cities in the PRC. This output will include (i) a working paper on \nGHG  emissions  under  business-as-usual  and  alternative  scenarios  completed  for  various \nsectors that considers peaking GHG emissions (Developing Xiangtan into a Green and Low-\nCarbon City); (ii) a seminar on the proposed LCD scenarios involving all stakeholders; and (iii) \nLCD  Road  Map for Xiangtan  identifying key  infrastructure  investments  to  promote  LCD  in \nXiangtan. \n \n14.  This TA assumes that (i) the government remains committed to promoting LCD, (ii) \ninternational experience and lessons regarding LCD can be adapted to the PRC context of \nsmall- and medium-sized cities, and (iii)  the NDRC and other relevant national authorities \nremain committed to the TA activities and will provide timely guidance and support.  \n \n15.  The main risks to the successful implementation of the TA are (i) inadequate or ill-timed \nprovision  of  necessary  data,  and  (ii)  poor  cross-agency  and  cross-sector  coordination, \npotentially affecting consensus on proposed policies. To mitigate these risks, the recruitment \nand performance of the consultants will be monitored closely, and XMG has agreed to provide \nadequate  counterpart  support  and  all  necessary  data.  Close  coordination  among  the \nconsultants, the executing and implementing agencies, and ADB, as well as the establishment \nof a project steering committee that includes key ministries, will further mitigate these risks.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office \nsupplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic  transportation,  communication  facilities  for \nconsultants, and other in-kind contributions. The Xiangtan Municipal Office for Building a Two-\noriented  Society  (XMOBTOS)  will  provide  a  suitably  furnished  office  with  utilities  and \ntelecommunication access; materials, maps, data, and documents required for the TA; and the \ncost of utilities for the use of the consultants, counterpart professional staff, and support staff.  \n \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented from 1 September 2015 to 31 January 2017. The XMG will \nbe the executing agency for the TA, and the XMOBTOS will be the implementing agency.13 The \nXMOBTOS will be responsible for coordination and providing information and other necessary \nconditions  for  the  consultants  to  complete  their  tasks.  A  TA  management  office  will  be \nestablished within the XMOBTOS, and the agency\u2019s director will serve as the director of the TA \nmanagement office responsible for coordinating day-to-day operational matters among ADB, the \nconsultants, and related government agencies (the XMG and NDRC, among others). \n \n18.   It is expected that 24 person-months (7 international and 17 national) of consulting \nservices will be required (see the table below for a list of required project expertise). The \nconsulting firm will be selected by (i) using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, and (ii) inviting simplified technical proposals.14 The consultants\u2019 \nterms of reference are in Appendix 3. The TA requires highly qualified international and national \nexperts in the fields of LCD, energy management, and climate change mitigation. These experts \nwill  be  required  to  demonstrate  strong  experience  in  and  familiarity  with  climate  change \nmitigation and policies for cities in the context of the PRC and Asia. The consultants will be \nengaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nSummary of Consulting Services Requirement \nInternational  Person-  National  Person- \nName of position  months  Name of position  months \nUrban management specialist and team  7  Climate  mitigation  specialist  and  deputy  team  9 \nleader  leader \n    Energy management specialist  4 \n    Environmental economist  4 \nTotal  7  Total  17 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.
