INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Many countries in Asia and the Pacific have suffered from water-related disasters, such \nas floods caused by typhoons and heavy rains, and sea-level rise. In addition, climate change \nand rapid economic development are predicted to amplify these negative impacts. As one of the \nmost powerful nonstructural measures to guard against water-related disasters, monitoring and \nwarning  systems  have  been  implemented  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  by  combining  ground \nobservations  (rain  gauge,  water-level  gauge)  and  remote  observations  (radar  rain  gauge); \nimproving prediction accuracy of extreme weather events; and strengthening capacities of both \ngovernments and communities for pre- and post-disaster actions, including effective utilization \nof mass media for early warning and evacuation. However, there is still insufficient latency, \nfrequency, and coverage of observation data; a lack of high spatial resolution of topographic \nand land usage information in hazardous areas; and inadequate dissemination of warnings to \nlocal communities. \n \n2.  Recently,  space-based  technology  (SBT)  and  information  and  communication \ntechnology (ICT) have spread dramatically. For example, hourly global rainfall maps observed \nfrom satellites are provided via the internet about 4 hours after observation, and cellular phones \nhave  rapidly  spread  in  the  region.1 These  technologies  have  the  potential  to  improve  the \nmonitoring and warning system because (i) satellites can cover a wider area than existing \nground observation systems, and (ii) messages can be conveyed directly and simultaneously to \ncitizens in hazardous areas. However, there are several factors which should be investigated \nand developed before incorporating SBT and ICT into the monitoring and warning system: \n(i) harmonizing existing SBT and ICT systems, (ii) making operational and maintenance costs \nsustainable, and (iii) providing adequate management capacities for SBT and ICT. \n \n3.  In July 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration \nAgency (JAXA) signed a letter of intent to promote disaster management, climate change \nmitigation and adaptation, forest monitoring, and water resources management in Asia and the \nPacific by using SBT, mainly in the field of remote sensing. Bangladesh, the Philippines, and \nViet  Nam  have  expressed  interest  in  collaborating  with  ADB  and  JAXA  in  developing \ndemonstration projects to improve monitoring and warning systems by incorporating SBT and \nICT. Through the technical assistance (TA), these countries in partnership with ADB and JAXA \nhope to lay the foundation for subsequent feasibility studies of investment projects and for \ndemonstrating associated best practices to leaders and practitioners. The TA received concept \nclearance from ADB Management in December 2010. 2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Viet Nam are selected as pilot countries in the TA for \nthe following reasons: \n(i)  They are among the countries most prone to water-related disasters. From 1988 \nto  2008,  Bangladesh had  the  highest  death toll  from  water-related  disasters \namong  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),  the  Philippines  had  the  fifth-\nhighest toll, and Viet Nam the sixth. \n                                                 \n1  According to the International Telecommunication Union, the saturation level of cellular phones in 2008 was 27.9% \nin Bangladesh, 76.0% in the Philippines, and 86.9% in Viet Nam. In 2004, it was 1.9% in Bangladesh, 40.4% in the \nPhilippines, and 6.0% in Viet Nam. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 5 October 2011. \n ", "2 \n \n(ii)  Mitigating natural disaster is stressed in the country partnership strategies and/or \ncountry operations business plans.  \n(iii)  These  countries  have  strong  commitments  to  developing  structural  and \nnonstructural measures to mitigate water-related disasters. \n \n5.  Bangladesh faces significant physical challenges due to its flat topography and location \nat the confluence of three major international rivers\u2014the Brahmaputra, the Ganges, and the \nMeghna. Much of Bangladesh has adjusted itself to an annual wet season when 25% of its land \narea remains under water. Severe flooding, when about 60% of the country is flooded, occurs \nabout every decade. Periodic natural disasters, including cyclones and tidal surges, and dry \nseason droughts have severe impacts on agriculture, fisheries, and livelihoods of people living \nin affected areas. The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) under the Ministry of \nWater Resources is mandated to provide flood forecasting and is able to provide 3 days' lead \ntime.  The  BWDB  wishes  to  extend  the  flood  warning  lead  time  to  7  days  by  developing \nautomatic  ground  observation  data  in  Bangladesh  territory,  and  collecting  transboundary \nupstream satellite precipitation data, which is available via the internet. Each of these actions is \nexpected to extend the flood warning lead time for 2 days. \n \n6.  The Philippines is prone to the impacts of water-related disasters. Between 1998 and \n2007, 12,000 people perished, were injured, or went missing; around 49 million people were \ndisaster affected; and total damage was estimated at P77 billion. The devastation from tropical \ncyclones and severe weather disturbances accounted for 92.5% of the total damage from \nnatural disasters. These severe weather events caused significant damage to agriculture\u2014a \nvital industry in the Philippines. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical \nServices Administration (PAGASA) is mandated to provide hydrological forecasts in the major \nbasins of Agno, Bicol, Cagayan, and Pampanga. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and \nManagement Council under the Department of National Defense is responsible for ensuring the \nprotection and welfare of the people during disasters. Increasing prediction capability will assist \npoor and vulnerable communities in flood-prone areas make more informed and better planned \ndecisions and, thereby, reduce loss of life and assets. In the Cagayan River basin, the regional \noffice of PAGASA in Tuguegarao City receives hourly precipitation and water-level data from \nfive ground observation stations along the river, and receives monitoring data of the Magat Dam \noperated by the National Irrigation Center Controls. The southwestern part of the upper basin is \ncontrolled by the Magat Dam, but the eastern part of the mountainous catchment area does not \nhave any flood control infrastructure or ground observation stations. In 2010, the lower basin \nwas flooded because of heavy rains in the eastern part of the basin. \n \n7.  More than 80% of Viet Nam's population is at risk of direct impacts from natural disasters. \nFrom 1997 to 2006, 7,500 people either died or went missing as a result of disasters, with total \nlosses estimated at 1.5% of gross domestic product. It is realized that structural measures alone \nare not effective in some areas. The implementation plan of the National Strategy for Natural \nDisaster Prevention, Response, and Mitigation to 2020, approved by the prime minister in 2007, \nindicated that both nonstructural and structural measures are decisive forces in improving the \nadaptation  and  sustainable  development  capacities  in  the  context  of  natural  disaster.  The \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) analyzes precipitation data gathered \nfrom  rain  gauges,  meteorological  radar,  and  satellites,  and  provides  daily  short-term \nhydrological forecasts for major rivers to the Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control \nand media during the rainy season (June to December). The Central Committee for Flood and \nStorm  Control  issues  orders  for  specific  flood  prevention  and  mitigation  measures  to  the \nDepartment of Agriculture and Rural Development in relevant provinces, and each provincial \nDepartment of Agriculture and Rural Development provides flood warnings to local governments \n ", "  3\nand citizens within its jurisdiction through local media. However, problems remain: (i) existing \nobservatory devices cannot cover whole basins; and (ii) as it takes so long for MONRE to gather \nobservatory  data,  local  governments  often  do  not  have  enough  time  for  flood  protection \nmeasures, especially for flash floods that occur frequently in the northern and the central \nregions of Viet Nam, e.g., in the Red-Thai Bin River basin. \n \n8.  The TA is needed to assist Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Viet Nam to improve \nmonitoring and warning systems on flood risk management with reasonable cost and practical \nknowledge. The specific agenda includes (i) developing application methodologies for the use of \nSBT and ICT for flood risk management, (ii) developing strategies and programs for flood risk \nreduction by applying SBT and ICT, and (iii) developing capacity for SBT and ICT. The TA will \nalso help DMCs in the region develop their capacity to fully benefit from the use of SBT and ICT \nin  river  basin  management  by  providing  additional  technical  support  to  ADB  projects  and \nsurveys, and by disseminating knowledge and best practices. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be reduction in losses from flooding events. The outcome of \nthe TA will be improved river basin management including flood risk management using SBT \nand ICT in target countries. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The project activities will be organized two outputs to achieve the outlined outcome: (i) \nSBT and ICT applied for flood risk management, and (ii) selected staff able to apply SBT and \nICT in river basin management. \n \n11.  SBT  and  ICT  applied  for  flood  risk  management.  The  TA  will  support  the \ndevelopment  of  SBT  and  ICT  application  methodologies  for  flood  risk  management  in \nBangladesh, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. Target agencies will be assisted with advisory \nservices and financial support in formulating and implementing the following: (i) extending flood \nwarning lead times by 1\u20132 days in Bangladesh by collecting precipitation data publicly available \nfrom satellites and ground observation systems; (ii) developing existing flood analysis models in \nthe  Red-Thai  Bin  River  basin  in  Viet  Nam  by  collecting  satellites  precipitation  data;  (iii) \ndeveloping a system in the Cagayan River basin in the Philippines to provide satellite-based \nprecipitation data and transfer it to the existing flood analysis model; and (iv) developing flood \nwarning  dissemination  and  disaster  monitoring  systems  using  web-based  geographic \ninformation systems and cellular phones in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. All systems will be \nevaluated through trials. \n \n12.  To support implementation of the methodology outlined in para. 11, the TA will assess \nand prepare strategies, guidelines, and programs for flood risk reduction applying SBT and ICT \nin Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. The TA output is expected to provide a basis for \nthe  agencies  (through  the  governments)  to  seek  further  ADB  assistance  in  terms  of \ninfrastructure, management systems, associated policy, and institutional development. \n \n13.  Selected staff able to apply SBT and ICT in river basin management. The TA will \nstrengthen staff capacities of target agencies and stakeholders in Bangladesh, the Philippines, \nand Viet Nam for applying SBT and ICT to flood risk management in a sustainable manner, \n ", "4 \n \noptimizing existing human and technical resources and experience in target agencies. Expected \ntraining programs are (i) the development or upgrade of flood analysis models using SBT and \nICT, including harmonization with existing systems, and socioeconomic and topographical data \nmanagement; (ii) satellite data processing, validation, and analysis; (iii) web-based geographic \ninformation systems; and (iv) dissemination of warnings to local communities by cellular phone. \nThe  specific  activities  will  be  developed  in  further  information  collection  and  consultation \nsessions with target agencies. \n \n14.  The TA will help DMCs develop their capacity to fully benefit from the use of SBT and \nICT in river basin management by providing additional technical support to ADB projects and \nsurveys. Possible technical support consists of developing their capacities for (i) detecting \naffected areas after water-related disasters, (ii) creating cost-effective and high-accuracy hazard \nmaps, and (iii) monitoring land use in urban areas and/or mountainous areas including glaciers. \n \n15.  The TA will support dissemination of knowledge and practices on SBT and ICT with \nDMCs and development partners in the region through regional workshops. The regional SBT \nrequirements that will be reflected in satellite development programs of Asian space agencies \nwill also be specified in the regional workshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,648,435, of which $2 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. JAXA will contribute \na total of $648,435 equivalent in-kind contribution on counterpart personnel cost, technical fees, \nand administration services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB, through the Sustainable Infrastructure Division of its Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, will be the executing agency. The division will collaborate with the \nADB's Water Community of Practice, regional departments, and resident missions concerned. \nTeam members from regional departments will coordinate implementation of in-country TA \nactivities.  JAXA  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  in  accordance  with  the  letters  of  intent \nbetween ADB and JAXA. In accordance with the partnership agreement which ADB and JAXA \nwill conclude for their collaboration under the TA, JAXA will provide its services on an in-kind \nbasis, and ADB will provide advance(s) to JAXA for travel costs of JAXA staff members, and \nequipment and surveys procured by JAXA. Such advance(s) should be liquidated in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). JAXA will submit (i) semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of TA funds \nadministered by it as advance(s), and (ii) an audited annual report for use of such funds. \nThroughout  the  implementation  of  the  TA,  JAXA  will  support  ADB  to  manage  and  direct \nconsultants in order to achieve expected outputs, and provide technical inputs for creating \ndigital  surface  models  and  calibrated  precipitation  data  from  remote  sensing  data  by \ncollaborating  closely  with  ADB  headquarters,  resident  missions,  and  target  agencies.  The \nfunding and implementation of the TA are subject to (i) signing of the partnership agreement \nbetween ADB and JAXA, (ii) receipt by ADB of no-objection letters from the governments of the \nthree pilot countries, and (iii) approval by ADB of a detailed work program for each component. \nThe TA will be implemented over 24 months, from April 2012 to March 2014. \n \n18.  Target agencies will include the BWDB in Bangladesh, PAGASA in the Philippines, and \nthe MONRE in Viet Nam. The target agencies in the three pilot countries will assign TA project \n ", "  5\ndirectors from among senior staff to supervise and coordinate TA in-country activities and to \nparticipate  in  the  regional  workshops.  Close  coordination  will  be  essential  with  related \ngovernment agencies including space agencies, stakeholders, ADB, JAXA, and consultants to \nensure synergy of activities and value addition to outcomes through regular joint meetings \norganized by the target agencies.  \n \n19.  The  TA  will  require  112  person-months  of  consulting  services  (32  person-months \ninternational and 80 person-months national [Appendix 3]) to implement the TA components in \nthe three pilot countries. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). For the selection of \na main consulting firm, the quality- and cost-based selection (90:10) method will be used \nbecause of the requirement for high-qualified technique, knowledge, and experience to achieve \nexpected outputs, and the firm will be required to submit biodata technical proposals. For the \nselection of two consulting firms each in Bangladesh (18 person-months) and Viet Nam (10 \nperson-months),  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  will  be  used.3 In  addition,  individual \nconsultants specialized in remote sensing, ICT, capacity development, and hydrology will be \nengaged to incorporate sophisticated technologies into specific systems and capacities in the \nthree pilot countries. The consultants will work under the overall supervision of ADB with the \nsupport of JAXA.  \n \n20.  Any  procurement  under  this  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  A  digital  surface  model  obtained  from \nsatellites will be procured by JAXA from PASCO Corporation through the direct contracting \nmethod  because  (i)  its  proposed  price  is  competitive  and  reasonable;  and  (ii)  PASCO \nCorporation has considerable knowledge of the existing satellite systems and, therefore, has \nexperience of exceptional worth for the assignment.4 Disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. At the end of the TA, \nequipment purchased through the shopping method under the TA will be assigned to the \nagencies concerned in the DMCs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Applying Remote Sensing Technology in River Basin \nManagement. \n                                                 \n3 Highly specialized expertise in cellular phone systems in Bangladesh and Viet Nam is required for the assignments, \nand only a few consultants, such as cellular phone companies in those countries, are expected to be qualified. \nEstimated contract value is $63,000 in Bangladesh and $35,000 in Viet Nam. \n4  PASCO Corporation was established in 1953 in Japan as an aerial survey company, and focuses on providing \ngeospatial information by the integration of remote sensing and ubiquitous technology. Its capital is \u00a58.76 billion as \nof 31 March 2011. It can provide a digital surface model obtained from satellites with an area of 100,000 square \nkilometers and vertical accuracy of 5 meters for $200,000.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Risks\nImpact      Assumption \nReduction in losses  By 2020, annual economic  National statistics; water  Political will and \nfrom flooding events  losses from flood events in  publications; sector reports  commitment by all \nthe three target countries  of ADB, JAXA, and  target countries to \nreduced by 10% (1980-2010  knowledge partners  mitigate flood risks \nbaseline: $491 million)   \n  Risk \nAccurate and cost-effective  Inadequate priority of \nriver basin management  investments for flood \nachieved in developing  risk management  \nmember countries (DMCs) \n(2010 baseline: none) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved river basin  Flood risk management  Strategies and programs  Adequate technical and \nmanagement  strategies and programs  of BWDB, PAGASA, and  institutional capacities \nincluding flood risk  incorporating SBT and ICT  MONRE  for river basin \nmanagement using  prepared in three pilot    management applying \nSBT and ICT in  countries (2011 baseline:    SBT and ICT \ntarget countries  none)     \n      Financing for river \nAt least one target  Reports of BWDB,  basin management \norganization in each pilot  PAGASA, and MONRE  applying SBT and ICT \ncountry has designed and     \nimplemented application of    Risk \nSBT and ICT (2011    Insufficient interest, \nbaseline: none)    political will, financing, \n    and collaboration with \nKnowledge and practice in  Reports of BWDB,  SBT and ICT \nthree pilot countries and  PAGASA, and MONRE,  stakeholders \nother DMCs shared in the  ADB website and sector \nregion (2011 baseline: none)  report \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
