Indonesia is endeavoring to recover from the Asian financial crisis by addressing, among \nothers, endemic issues of weak governance, in particular, the weakness of the legal and judicial \nsystem, which has affected enforcement of rule of law. The Government recognizes this and in \nits 1999\u20132004 Guidelines for State Policy, indicated that one of its five national objectives is to \nachieve rule of law.1 As a part of its overall support to strengthen governance in Indonesia, \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) 2003\u20132005 country and strategy program for Indonesia has \nidentified legal and judicial reform as a primary focus area. To support the effort, ADB has \nprepared this technical assistance (TA) to assist in the improvement of judicial administration. \nThe Fact-Finding Mission for this TA was fielded in two phases: 1\u20133 September 2003 and 9\u201315 \nOctober 2003. The Mission was able to reach an understanding with the Government and the \nSupreme Court on the purpose and output, key activities and methodologies, cost estimates \nand financing, implementing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services of the \nTA.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    Reforms in the judiciary have received momentum through the implementation of Law \n35/1999, which stipulates that by the end of August 2004, the administrative responsibilities of \nthe lower branches of the judiciary, which are currently in the hands of the executive branch, will \nbe transferred to the Supreme Court. This, upon implementation, will place the Supreme Court \nat the center of judicial administration in Indonesia. \n \n3.  To  position  itself  for  this  increased  role,  the  Supreme  Court  commissioned  the \nformulation of several \u201cblueprints\u201d for its own reforms and that of other aspects of the judiciary.3 \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), in collaboration with the Netherlands, financed four \nblueprints: (i) an academic draft and bill on the judicial commission, (ii) the policy paper on \njudicial  personnel  management  reform,  (iii)  the  policy  paper  on  the  court\u2019s  financial \nmanagement reform, and (iv) the policy paper on permanent judicial education system reform.  \nA fifth blueprint, supported by the Partnership for Governance Reform, pertains to  Supreme \nCourt reform. The blueprints are the first of their kind to be conducted through a collaborative \nworking relationship between the Supreme Court and local civil society, with a special focus on \njudicial reform.4 A steering committee will be established by the Supreme Court to implement \nthe blueprints. The donor community, led by IMF, is also collaborating with the Supreme Court \nto implement the reforms recommended in the blueprints. The TA aims to adopt some of the \nrecommendations of the blueprint on the reform of the Supreme Court and the policy paper on \npermanent  judicial  education  system  reform.  The  Supreme  Court  has  requested  ADB\u2019s \nassistance to help resolve case management issues. The TA has been developed in close \ncollaboration with the aid agencies and complements the role of other aid agencies. The \nSupreme Court, which will have a substantially increased role by the end of August 2004, will be \nthe Executing Agency for the TA. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002. Indonesia Country and Strategy Program (2003-2005). Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 June 2003. \n3 The term \u201cblueprint\u201d is used throughout this TA report to refer to an analytical study commissioned to recommend \naction for reforms in the judiciary, including the Supreme Court. This is a generally accepted terminology within the \nIndonesian legal and judicial community. \n4 Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) Report, Indonesia Maintaining Stability, Deepening Reforms, released in \nconjunction with the CGI Meeting, held in Bali, 21-22 January 2003. ", "2          \n \n \n4.   Several significant problems in case management have been identified at the Supreme \nCourt. Such problems are manifest at all stages of the process of litigation at the court, from the \ntime a case is registered until the judgment is disseminated to the litigants.5 For example, \nlitigants may be able to gain registration of cases dated prior to their actual submission and, due \nto a lack of transparency, this may go unnoticed. Therefore, the flow of cases in the Supreme \nCourt must be made far more transparent. The Supreme Court has created systems, such as \nAkses-121 or Sistem Informasi Mahkamah Agung Republik Indonesia (SIMARI-the Information \nSystem of the Supreme Court), that attempt to allow the public to track cases; however, the \nsystems have at least two problems. First, they are only in the Supreme Court, so that litigants \nhave to be physically present in the Supreme Court to track the status of a case. Second, the \nsystems do not provide sufficient information on the actual stage of the case-flow (footnote 5, \npp. 130-132).  Therefore, an effective case tracking system, which is easily accessible and \nprovides more comprehensive information, should be created to allow for greater transparency. \nSuch transparency could, in turn, create better accountability and lead to greater predictability in \nthe management of cases in the Supreme Court. The establishment of a new system should \nuse the current resources available in the Supreme Court.   \n \n5.  In line with the need to increase transparency in the Supreme Court, the public should \nalso  be  provided  with  greater  access  to  previous  judgments.  Presently,  Supreme  Court \njudgments are only available through certain publications, which are limited in circulation and \ncover only a small number of cases. A mechanism is needed to allow for greater public \ndissemination of judgments issued by the Supreme Court (footnote 5, p. 136). Therefore, the TA \nwill conduct a study on the best mechanism to facilitate dissemination of Supreme Court \njudgments to the public. The TA will also prepare a draft decree to be issued by the chief justice \nof the Supreme Court on the requirement for the dissemination of judgments to the public. The \ndraft decree will include implementing guidelines, which will take into account the findings of the \nfeasibility study.  \n \n6.  The other problem found in the Supreme Court is the inconsistency of judgments issued, \neven where similar points of law are being decided. There are several causes for this, such as \n(i) the Indonesian legal system not adhering to the principle of binding precedent, (ii) the lack of \naccess by the Supreme Court judges to cases with similar points of law, and (iii) the absence of \nan effective chamber system. Addressing item (i) would require involvement of legislative action \nbeyond  the  Supreme  Court\u2019s  mandate.  However,  it  can  mitigate  the  other  causes  of \ninconsistency by creating an effective case distribution system.  \n \n7.  To have a proper case distribution mechanism, a proper case classification system is \nneeded first. The classification of cases could be based on (i) the similarity of the legal issues \ninvolved, or (ii) level of difficulty of the cases (footnote 5, pp. 92-93). Once a proper case \nclassification system has been established, using the appropriate information technology (IT), \nthe Supreme Court could establish a data base on previous judgments it has issued.6 The data \nbase should be easily accessible by each Supreme Court judge (and assistants) to enable them \nto examine cases in a more expeditious manner. Such an IT system must be complemented \nwith a proper chamber system.7 This TA will also study what is the most effective chamber \nsystem for the Indonesian Supreme Court.    \n                                                 \n5 Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia. 2003. The Blueprint on the Reform of the Supreme Court (pp. 88-125). \nJakarta. \n6 The data base would be categorized under the case classification created by this TA. \n7 The Supreme Court has 51 judge positions. The management comprises the chief justice, deputy chief justice, and \nsix junior chief justices.  The judges are divided into eight chambers. Each chamber is headed by one of the \nmanagement members. Each chamber, in principle, will have at most three panels of judges. At present, the ", "    3 \n \n \n \n \n8.  Many of the Supreme Court judges consider that the lack of effective case management \ncontributes to the massive backlog of cases in the Supreme Court (footnote 5, p.17), (currently \nestimated at 16,000 cases).8  \n \n9.    To obtain the results intended under the TA, Supreme Court administrative personnel \nneed adequate training. They have had some training, but it has not been adequately focused \nand better qualified instructors are needed. One of the blueprints suggested that the training \nshould focus on improving the skills required for the performance of the duties and work of the \ncourt administrative personnel.9 The proposed TA will develop and implement such capacity \nbuilding programs for the Supreme Court.  \n \n10.  By  the end of August 2004, the Supreme Court will have increased administrative \npowers over the lower branches of the judiciary. This will allow the TA\u2019s outputs to be replicated, \nwhere applicable, to improve the administration of lower courts.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA is aimed at strengthening the administration of the Supreme Court, as the apex \nbody of the court system. Institutional strengthening will facilitate the reforms at the Supreme \nCourt and eventually throughout the judiciary.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The TA will include the following components:  \n \n(i)  Case  management  in  the  Supreme  Court.  This  component  includes  the \nfollowing subcomponents:  \n \na.  Improvement  of  the  case  administration.  The  output  from  this \nsubcomponent  will  be  an  improved  case-tracking  mechanism  in  the \nSupreme Court. \n \nb.  Effective public dissemination of Supreme Court judgments.  The \ninitial output from this subcomponent will be a feasibility study conducted \nto determine, under local circumstances, the best mechanism for the \ndissemination of Supreme Court judgments. Based on this study, the TA \nwill  prepare  a  draft  decree,  to  be  issued  by  the  chief  justice  of  the \nSupreme Court, on the requirement for public access to judgments issued \nby the Supreme Court. The decree will be accompanied by guidelines on \nits implementation.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nvarious chambers are not strictly specialized according to the different areas of laws. Therefore, each chamber may \nexamine a range of cases.  \n8 ADB-Indonesia Resident Mission. 2002. Country Governance Assessment Report of the Republic of Indonesia. \nJakarta.  \n9 Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia. 2003. Policy Paper on Permanent Education and Training System for \nJudges and Court Personnel Reform, pp. 140-144. Jakarta. ", "4          \n \n \nc.  Facilitation of the production of consistent judgments.  The initial \noutput from this subcomponent will be the establishment of a new case \nclassification system to improve the case distribution system. The new \ncase classification system will include sex-disaggregated information and \ngender-based cases. Using the case classification system, an automated \ndata base, accessible to the Supreme Court judges (and assistants), on \nprevious judgments issued by the Supreme Court will be established. In \naddition, a study will be made of the most effective chamber system for \nthe Supreme Court.  \n \n(ii)  Capacity  building  for  Supreme  Court  administration  personnel.  It  is \nexpected  that  the  training  will  improve  the  capacity  of  the  Supreme  Court \nadministrative  personnel  to  manage  cases.  Since  the  output  of  the  case \nmanagement component of the TA will increase automation in the court, the \ntraining will include the training on the  use of IT and its application to judicial \nadministration.  The  training  will  be  provided  equally  to  male  and  female \nadministrative staff and will use a \u201ctraining-of-trainers\u201d approach. The aim of this \ncomponent is to prepare staff for the administration of a more automated court \nsystem. \n \n13.  The TA will use IT solutions to improve systems and procedures. The TA is designed to \nupgrade existing resources, where possible, rather than create new or overlapping resources. \nThe  first  component  will  emphasize  transparency  in  the  judicial  process.  The  increasing \ntransparency in the judicial process will contribute to the reduction of corruption, which, in turn, \nwill allow for greater predictability in the judicial process. The second component will provide the \nnecessary training for the personnel to be able implement effectively the output of the first \ncomponent. Both components will be implemented simultaneously.  The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, of which $310,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $315,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent covering the total foreign exchange cost and \n$190,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost \nof  $125,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and workshops. Details of \nthe cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.   The Supreme Court will be the Executing Agency. The Supreme Court will appoint a TA \nmanager, ideally a second-echelon official in the Supreme Court with considerable experience \nin case management.  The manager will coordinate the day-to-day activities relating to the TA.  \nThe manager, with an appropriate number of support staff, will dedicate a substantial amount of \ntime in this role. The manager will submit monthly reports to the steering committee and ADB on \nthe progress of the TA. \n \n16.  To ensure proper coordination with the other stakeholders, including those in other \nrelevant  Government  agencies,  a  steering  committee  will  be  established.  The  person \ndesignated as the coordinator of the Supreme Court Steering Committee for Judiciary Reform ", "    5 \n \n \n \n \nwill head the steering committee for this TA, which will comprise members from the National \nPlanning Agency (BAPPENAS); Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Justice; and, as appropriate, a \nnon-government  organization  actively  involved  in  the  legal  and  judicial  sector.  The \nrepresentative from each government agency should be a person whose function within the \nagency includes the administering or facilitating the administration of the judiciary. The steering \ncommittee will meet periodically, at least once a month or more often, if required, to regularly \nreview the implementation of the TA. In addition, the committee will also provide general \nguidance and policy direction to the TA manager, to ensure that the output of the TA can be fully \nimplemented and replicated in other courts. The steering committee will prepare a report within \n2 months after the completion of the TA, assessing and evaluating the achievements of the TA. \nThe report will be submitted to the chief justice of the Supreme Court and ADB.  \n \n17.  The TA will require a total of 39 persons-months of consulting services, comprising 9 \nperson-months of international and 30 person-months of domestic consultancy. An international \nconsulting firm will be recruited for the services, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants and using the simplified technical proposal. Quality-and-cost-based selection will be \nused to choose the consulting firm. The consultants should have expertise in case management \nand the implementation of IT in the judiciary. The international consultants will be required to \nwork closely with the domestic consultants. One of the international consultants, in association \nwith the domestic consultants, will provide the necessary training to the administrative personnel \nin the judiciary. The outline terms of reference of the consultants (which include the consultants \nreporting requirements) are provided in Appendix 3. The consultants will also procure the \nequipment required under the TA using ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The TA will take 6 \nmonths to implement from the beginning of April 2004 and to the end of September 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for the Improvement of the Administration of the Supreme Court, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6        Appendix 1   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
