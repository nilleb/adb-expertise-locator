THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Regional Upgrades of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures for Trade \nProject.1 \n \n2.  Improvement of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures in Mongolia in compliance \nwith the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on the application of SPS measures is an \nessential  prerequisite for  Mongolia  to  increase  agriculture  and food  trade  and  diversify  its \neconomy. 2 The proposed project will address this issue through upgrading of laboratories and \ninspections facilities, strengthening of the inspection management system (IMS), and aligning \nSPS controls and inspections with international standards. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development challenges. Agriculture accounted for 14% of Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct and 28% of employment in 2014, and remains the backbone of the rural economy in \nMongolia. Agriculture is dominated by livestock husbandry, with meat and wool production \naccounting for 80% of the total output. Increased agricultural value-added from 2012 to 2014 \nhas  been  important  in  poverty  alleviation  because  the  incomes  of  the  most  economically \nvulnerable people are closely tied to agriculture.3 Agricultural production is labor-intensive and \nthus an important source of employment in rural areas. About 85% of the rural population is \ndependent on livestock. This is particularly the case for herders, who account for one-third of \nthe country\u2019s population, and for whom livestock is the sole income source. The processing of \nagricultural products also creates critical employment opportunities for migrants in urban areas. \n \n4.  Expanding and modernizing agriculture is essential to bolster rural incomes and reduce \npoverty  and  income  inequality  in  Mongolia.  A  productive  primary  sector  is  also  critical  to \ndiversification of the country\u2019s limited sources of growth. Economic diversification stands as \nMongolia\u2019s biggest medium-term challenge, and is vital for employment generation and to make \neconomic growth sustainable and more inclusive.  \n \n5.  Mongolia has an estimated 52 million head of livestock, and just 3 million inhabitants, \nand there is excellent potential to expand animal husbandry. The country is well-endowed and \nlocated to serve northeast and central Asian markets, where demand for meat and milk is \nincreasing  rapidly.  Currently  only  1.5%  of  the  meat  produced  in  Mongolia  is  exported. \nMongolia\u2019s agrifood export potential is hampered by poor SPS standards. For instance, lack of \nadequate controls for infectious diseases renders the livestock sector vulnerable to disease \noutbreaks, and the incidence of infectious animal and foodborne diseases, such as brucellosis \nand equine infectious anemia, remains high. Mongolia's trading partners frequently impose \ntemporary  bans  on  importing  live  animals  and  animal  products from Mongolia  because of \ncontagious animal disease outbreaks. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement sets out the basic rules for food safety and animal and plant \nhealth standards (international standards). It allows countries to set their own standards, but regulations must be \nbased on science and an appropriate assessment of risks. \n3  Agricultural value-added increased by an annual average of 18.2% during 2012\u20132014. ", "2 \n6.  The  cost  of  trade  is  high  because  of  cumbersome  border  procedures,  further \nexacerbating the situation. The World Bank ranks Mongolia 135th out of 160 countries in the \nLogistic Performance Index 2014, and Mongolia has one of the lowest scores for customs \nclearance and border crossing.4  \n \n7.  These factors deprive the country of the opportunity to diversify exports and insulate the \neconomy from swings in mineral prices. Strengthening SPS measures in line with international \nstandards while facilitating customs and border-crossing procedures is essential to expand \nagriculture production and sustain inclusive growth and foster economic diversification. \n \n8.  SPS  system  weaknesses  increase  trade  costs,  and  time  required  to  meet  export \nrequirements. A study conducted by the Mongolia National Chamber of Commerce and Industry \nin 2013 found that 4 days were needed to obtain veterinary and sanitary certificates when \nexporting meat. Obtaining sanitary permits took up to 41 days when importing sugar and up to \n48 days when importing vegetable oil.5 \n \n9.  Two main institutions in Mongolia are involved in the application of SPS measures: (i) \nthe General Agency for Specialized Inspection (GASI), reporting to the Office of the Deputy \nPrime Minister, which is responsible for inspecting export and imports of food and products of \nanimal and plant origin, and for border inspection generally; and (ii) the Veterinary and Animal \nBreeding Agency (VABA) under the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, which is responsible for \ndisease prevention and control, laboratory services, and accrediting and licensing veterinarians. \nGiven Mongolia\u2019s vast territory, both institutions are supported by a central laboratory that is \nequipped with modern technology and a network of laboratories located at border crossing \npoints (BCPs) and 13 aimags (provinces). \n \n10.  Sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures. From 2004 to 2014, Mongolia significantly \nimproved its SPS system, including the SPS legislation, standards, inspection procedures, and \nlaboratory network. In particular, the country has adopted a new Food Law and a new Law on \nEnsuring Food Safety, which introduced modern principles and approaches in the area of food \nsafety. The capacity of many SPS laboratories has been upgraded with the assistance of \nbilateral and multilateral development partners, such as the World Bank, the International Fund \nfor  Agricultural  Development,  the  European  Union,  and  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development.6 With the assistance of the International Finance Corporation, the \ngovernment has developed a framework for risk-based SPS control over imports. More than \n5,500 products have been classified as low, medium, or high risk. Low-risk goods require only a \ncheck of documentation; medium-risk products require a documentation check and inspection; \nand high-risk goods a documentation check, inspection, and laboratory testing.7 \n \n11.  Despite these improvements, Mongolia's SPS system has the following weaknesses: \n(i)  Many laboratories lack the facilities, equipment, and/or human resources needed \nto perform their functions properly. The overall capacity of the laboratory network \nis insufficient to establish an appropriate level of protection against internal and \nexternal risks to public, animal, and plant health. In addition, SPS control at \n                                                \n4  World Bank. 2014. Logistics Performance Index.

Mongolia: Border Inspection Report. Unpublished. \n ", "3 \nBCPs is generally inadequate. BCPs lack facilities for disinfection of vehicles and \nunloading  and  quarantine  of  live  animals  and  products  of  animal  origin. \nInspectors do not have special equipment for examination of live animals and \nsampling of pathological material (footnote 6). Some BCPs are located far away \nfrom  and/or  have  poor  transport  links  with  SPS  laboratories.  Consequently, \ntransporting samples taken at these BCPs to and from SPS laboratories often \ncauses long delays in SPS clearance of imports. \n(ii)  The  SPS  system  has  not  been  modernized  through  adoption  of  information \ntechnology  and  risk  management.  Risk  management  recognizes  and \nincorporates differences in risks, and thereby provides guidance to policy makers \nwith regard to priorities and allows resources to be used efficiently. Only one \ncriterion (i.e., product type) is used in the framework for risk-based SPS control \nover imports, and the framework is not implemented at some BCPs, resulting in \nexcessive inspection of imports (footnote 7). \n(iii)  Mongolia\u2019s SPS measures are not well harmonized with international standards. \nMany sampling and testing methods and inspection techniques are outdated and \ndo not conform to international standards, resulting in gaps, inconsistencies, and \nnonconformities. \n \n12.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  regional  technical  assistance  on  Promoting \nCooperation in Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures for the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) funded an assessment of SPS measures in CAREC countries. 8 CAREC \nmembers recognize the importance of SPS reforms as a means to stimulate economic growth \nand competitiveness, and are adopting a common agenda for modernization of SPS measures. \nBy addressing the weaknesses mentioned in para. 11, Mongolia will take the lead in promoting \nSPS reforms in the framework of CAREC. \n \n13.  Lessons. The project builds on past and ongoing technical assistance related to SPS \nsupported  by  development  partners  and  ADB.  Experience  shows  that  improving  relevant \ninfrastructure and capacities related to food safety and animal and plant health with the goal of \npromoting trade or meeting other domestic policy objectives requires coordination of multiple \npublic agencies that deal with SPS issues, and is facilitated by regular meetings of agencies \nthat promote discussions and coordination. The project steering committee (PSC) will include a \nnumber  of  stakeholders  to  enhance  coordination  and  information  exchange.  An  integrated \napproach to the three major areas of concern (i.e. food safety, animal health and plant health) is \nbeneficial so as to develop a common risk analysis framework and infrastructure. In addition, \ninadequate capacities at the country level are major constraints for effective SPS arrangements. \nInvolvement of the private sector in SPS capacity building is necessary to ensure that the right \nchallenges  are  addressed.  During  project  preparation  consultations  were  held  with  private \nsector  which  contributed  to  the  overall  project  design.  Regular  information  exchange  and \nconsultations will be maintained during implementation. \n \n14.  National effort in regional and international perspective. The project is consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2014\u20132016; 9  the  country \noperations business plan, 2015;10 and with CAREC\u2019s Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy \n2020.11 Economic diversification is a major goal of Mongolia\u2019s Government Platform (2012\u2013\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2013.

The project is also aligned with the government\u2019s WTO commitments. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n15.  The impacts will be increased agrifood trade along CAREC corridor 4, sub-corridor 4b, \nand  enhanced  economic  diversification  to  make  economic  growth  sustainable  and  more \ninclusive. 12  Increased  exports  will  generate  employment  opportunities  and  foster  rural \ndevelopment. The outcome will be improved SPS measures in compliance with the WTO and in \nline with the recommendations of the SPS common agenda. \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  The project will have three outputs: \n \n17.  Output  1:  Laboratories  and  border  crossing  point  inspection  and  quarantine \nfacilities upgraded. Laboratories in three aimags, served by the CAREC corridor that links \nBCPs  critical  to  the  movement  of  agricultural  and  food  products,  will  be  upgraded  to \ndecentralize testing and diagnostic capacity and support early disease detection.13 Investments \nwill include laboratory infrastructure, equipment, and quality management. Renovation and/or \nconstruction of laboratory buildings will be undertaken to ensure suitable conditions for the \noperation of a modern well-equipped laboratory. A laboratory information management system \n(LIMS)  will  be  introduced  to  manage  samples,  and  associated  analysis  and  reporting. \nInvestments at BCPs will include inspection, disinfection, and quarantine facilities. \n18.  Output 2: Sanitary and phytosanitary inspection management system established. \nThe SPS IMS will avoid duplication of documents relating to applications for and approval of \npermission to import and export agrifood products. The IMS will also integrate full development \nof a risk-based import control system to automate risk assessment and management processes, \ninvolving border control inspection, laboratories, and central administration. The data collected \nby the laboratories and reported using the LIMS will be fed into the IMS. \n \n19.  Output  3:  Sanitary  and  phytosanitary  control  and  inspections  aligned  with \ninternational  standards.  Testing  and  sampling  methodologies  will  be  aligned  with  WTO-\ncompliant international standards to reduce inspection- and testing-related delays and gain \ninternational acceptance, and corresponding access to WTO-member economies. Standard \noperating procedures (SOPs) for laboratory and control system requirements (including food \nimport  and  export  inspection  and  certification)  will  be  developed  in  line  with  international \nstandards to make the fullest use of the upgraded facilities. Laboratory staff will be trained in the \nuse of the new equipment. When a suitable level of competence is achieved, the process of \naccreditation to international standards will be initiated, leading to international accreditation for \nselected tests. \n \n20.  Project  management  activities.  The  project  will  support  the  establishment  of  an \neffective project management system by developing the capacity of the executing agency and \nimplementing agencies for project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n                                                \n12 CAREC Corridor 4b connects Russia to Mongolia and PRC. \n13 Aimags: Darkhan-Uul, Dornogovi, and Selenge.

DUE DILIGENCE \n26.  Investments will focus on three aimags served by the CAREC corridor  and two BCPs \ncritical for the movement of agricultural and food products subject to SPS measures. \n \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nA.  Technical \n27.  Based on an assessment of the testing needs of individual laboratories and, in particular, \nthe role of each laboratory in the testing of imports and exports, and an evaluation of current \ntesting capacity, equipment will be procured to (i) enable each laboratory to carry out tests they \npreviously could not carry out (these tests would either have been done in other laboratories, \nrequiring samples to be sent over long distances, or not done); and (ii) improve testing (a) \nreliability  and  accuracy  (through  modernization  and/or  replacement  of  equipment),  and  (b) \nefficiency. \n \n28.  The SOPs for the operation of the facility and equipment will form the basis of training to \nensure all actions are taken in accordance with international standards. SPS inspectors at the \nquarantine  facility  will  be  supplied  with  equipment  required  for  inspection,  sampling,  and \ntransportation of samples. Staff will be trained to use the equipment in the prescribed manner. \n \n29.  The IMS will be designed, built, and commissioned to enable all those involved in \nagricultural and food product import, transit, and export to access information, and apply for and \nreceive  required  documentation  and  permissions  through  a  single  web-based  portal.  The \nsystem will facilitate the receipt, processing, and return of application data, permissions, and \ndocuments. \n \n30.  The current product-based import-risk assessment system will be expanded and further \ndeveloped and integrated into the IMS. The IMS will be housed and maintained on a dedicated \nhardware facility operated by GASI, and the required software and hardware will be supplied to \nthe SPS agencies to enable them to fully participate in the system. The LIMS will be introduced \ninto the five laboratories to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness and enable the data from \nthe laboratories to be reported automatically and in a standardized format to the central level \nand fed into the IMS. Further, the IMS design will ensure interoperability with the ADB-assisted \ncustoms automated information system to facilitate information exchange between GASI and \nthe Customs General Administration on agrifood imports and exports, and enable efficient \nborder operations.15  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n31.  The anticipated economic benefits of the project include increased agrifood exports from \nMongolia and reduced documentation and time required for approval of import and export of \nagrifood goods.  \n \n32.  The economic analysis resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 15.8% and net \npresent value of $2.1 million. The investments are considered economically justifiable. \n \n33.  The financial sustainability of the project has been assessed on a fiscal and project-level \nbasis.  The  government  has  committed  to  provide  the  necessary  recurrent  funds  following \nproject completion to ensure the benefits of the investment are sustained. \n  \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2006.

Based on the identified financial management challenges and related fiduciary risks, \nADB has outlined a time-bound action plan to mitigate risks.16  Specific actions include (i) \nprioritizing activities and related spending in the annual planning and budgeting process, (ii) \nsetting up an audit committee in GASI and carrying out an internal audit at VABA at least once \nper year, and (iii) undertaking full information technology backups of the accounting software \nprogram and financial data on a weekly basis. In addition, the project management unit will \ninclude  a full-time finance  specialist. On this  basis,  the  planned  project  arrangements  are \nconsidered satisfactory to ensure implementation complies with ADB policy, operational, and \nprocedural requirements. \n  \n36.  All procurement to be financed by ADB will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All consulting services to be \nfinanced under the project will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Project implementation, procurement, and \nfinancial management will be aligned with the government\u2019s SOPs. Auditors acceptable to ADB \nwill audit the project accounts annually. The project will strengthen staff capacity in financial \nmanagement  procedures,  and  will  use  existing  government  websites  to  (i)  disclose \nimplementation progress, and bid notifications and results; and (ii) provide opportunities to \nreport corrupt practices. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n38.  The project will enable increased trade in Mongolia\u2019s agricultural and food products as \ntheir relative safety improves and they gain acceptance in foreign markets, notably the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  and  Russian  Federation.  Increased  exports  will  contribute  to  economic \ndiversification, generate employment opportunities, and foster rural development. Moreover, \nhealth risks associated with animal and plant diseases will be reduced. Indirect impacts include \nimproved efficiency of agrifood product import and export through trade facilitation, which will \nbenefit traders; reduced health risks associated with animal and plant diseases; and increased \nemployment opportunities resulting from increased trade. The project will not have a direct \nimpact on women. However, the existing laboratory staff are mainly female, and they will benefit \nfrom the new facilities and related training. \n \n                                                \n16 Table 2 of Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n39.  The project is classified as category B for the environment. An initial environmental \nexamination report and an environmental management plan have been prepared in compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the government\u2019s regulatory framework. The \nupgrading  of  laboratories  and  BCP  inspection  and  quarantine  facilities  may  have  an \nenvironmental impact. Potential adverse impacts include limited construction-related impacts, \nwhile operational impacts may involve unsafe collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of \nlaboratory waste. The possible adverse environmental impacts will be prevented or minimized to \nacceptable levels through the implementation of the environmental management plan, which \nincludes  adequate  mitigation  and  monitoring  arrangements  that  will  be  implemented  by \ncontractors  and  the  implementing  agencies.  The  initial  environmental  examination  was \ndisclosed on the ADB website on 7 October 2015. The climate risk screening exercise indicated \nthe project risk is medium. Results and recommendations of the climate risk and vulnerability \nassessment will be taken into account during the detailed design. The project is located on \ngovernment-owned land; there will be no land acquisition, and the project is classified as \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement. The project is classified as category C for indigenous \npeoples as the project will not affect ethnic minority communities. The project is in compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. In addition, the government is \ncommitted and has the institutional capacity required to manage environmental and social risks. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  The overall project benefits are expected to outweigh the costs and risks. Major risks \nand  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.17  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInsufficient commitment and  The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be the executing \ncoordination among key ministries   agency to coordinate all agencies and provide high-level oversight \ndealing with sanitary and  of project implementation. \nphytosanitary issues \nLimited experience of some  Before loan effectiveness, identify and train PMU staff who will \ngovernment agencies with ADB  assume day-to-day management of the project including \nprojects results in delays.  procurement, disbursement, and financial management; train \nexecuting and implementing agency staff in applicable ADB \nguidelines, policies, and regulations; and establish clear roles and \nresponsibilities among the executing agency, implementing \nagencies and the PMU. \nLack of operational and financial  The government has made assurances that it will allocate annual \nsustainability after project  budgetary resources to cover recurrent costs related to operation \ncompletion  and maintenance of the inspection management system, \nlaboratories, and border crossing point facilities.
