INTRODUCTION\n1. The World Summit on Sustainable Development will be the first meeting of heads of\nstate since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and has been dubbed the Rio+10\nSummit. Preparations for Rio+10 include review of progress achieved during the last 10 years in\nimplementing the Earth Summit\u2019s Agenda 21, and mapping out priority actions as short- and\nlong-term strategies for sustainable development. International organizations have been called\non  to  launch  a  preparatory  process  at  the  regional  and  subregional  levels  to  establish  a\nprovisional agenda and possible themes for Rio+10. Representatives of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB), Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and United\nNations  Environmental  Programme  (UNEP)  met  in  February  2001  to  discuss  possible\ncollaboration in assisting Asia and the Pacific developing countries to prepare for Rio+10. A\nfollow-up reconnaissance mission was undertaken in April 2001 to meet with senior officials of\nESCAP and UNEP\u2019s Regional Office in Bangkok to discuss (i) partnerships among the three\ninstitutions; (ii) the conceptual framework, objectives and scope of the technical assistance (TA);\nand (iii) formation of a steering committee and task force for the TA. An understanding was\nreached on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.\nSubregional  environmental  organizations  were  subsequently  consulted  to  determine  their\npriorities for Rio+10 preparations. A strong interest has been expressed at the subregional level,\nparticularly by the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nand Central Asian republic (CAR) developing member countries (DMCs). This TA will assist the\nsubregional preparatory process for Rio+10.1\nII.   BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The 1992 Earth Summit2 was an important milestone in addressing increasing global\nand local environmental degradation and risks. It produced action on five official agreements: (i)\nadoption of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, (ii) endorsement of Agenda\n21, an action plan setting forth ways of achieving sustainable development by the 21st century,\n(iii) signing of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, (iv) signing of the Convention on\nthe Protection of Biological Diversity, and (v) agreement on basic principles for managing and\nconserving the world\u2019s forests. Aside from the written commitments by most nations, the Earth\nSummit (i) secured a set of legal agreements among Governments for international cooperation\non development and environment; (ii) established political commitment to the agreement at the\nhighest level, and placed the issue of sustainable development on the international diplomatic\nagenda; (iii) opened new pathways for communication and cooperation between government\nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs); and (iv) led to an enormous increase in public\nawareness  on  environmental  issues.  A  number  of  programs  and  projects  have  been\nimplemented in line with the Earth Summit recommendations, and ADB has been instrumental\nin this regard, particularly ADB\u2019s assistance to DMCs for environmental and social capacity\nbuilding integrating poverty reduction and environmental improvement; strengthening of local\ngovernments and civil society participation; support for local actions to address global issues\nsuch as climate change, biodiversity conservation and desertification; and strengthening of\nsubregional cooperation for sustainable development.\n3. The 55th General Assembly of the United Nations called for a 10-year review of progress\nin  implementing  the  Earth  Summit\u2019s  recommendations  and  formulated  follow-up  action\n                  \n1  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 15 June 2001.\n2  ADB, with a delegation led by the President, actively participated in the 1992 Earth Summit and discussed the\nrole of regional development banks in the post-summit period.", "2\nproposals for consideration at the forthcoming Rio+10 Conference, to be held in September\n2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa. The conference will be at the summit level, and is needed\nto reinvigorate, at the highest political level, global commitment to sustainable development. 3 In\ndoing so, the summit and its preparatory process should ensure a balance between economic\ndevelopment, social development, and environmental protection, as these are interdependent\nand mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development.\n4. Major  objectives  of  Rio+10  will  include  a  review  of  progress  in  implementing\nrecommendations and the other outcomes of the Earth Summit, to be carried out at the local,\nnational, regional, and international levels by governments. The review will focus on  identifying\naccomplishments and areas where further efforts are needed to implement Agenda 21. Agenda\n21 sets a blueprint for action in the 1990s onto the 21st century of strategies and integrated\nmeasures  to  halt  and  reverse  the  effects  of  environmental  degradation,  and  promote\nenvironmentally sustainable development. Agenda 21 is premised on the belief that sustainable\ndevelopment is not an alternative to but an imperative in both environmental and economic\nterms.\n5.  In anticipation of Rio+10, environmental issues in Asia and the Pacific were discussed\nduring the interministerial conference on environment and development organized by ADB,\nESCAP,  and  UNEP  in  Kitakyushu,  Japan  in  September  2000.  The  participating  ministries\nconfirmed that the Agenda 21 implementation has been inhibited by a number of factors. While\nthe region\u2019s financial crisis slowed some efforts, institutional weakness and lack of financing\nwere the major barriers. The conference resulted in the Ministerial Declaration on Environment\nand Development in Asia and the Pacific on Vision for the Twenty-First Century. The Kitakyushu\nInitiatives focus on implementation of programs at the local level bringing together the local\ngovernment, NGOs, the private sector, and the general public, with involvement of national\ngovernment  to  ensure  the  (i)  setting  up  of  socioeconomic  and  technological  conditions  to\nachieve countrywide sustainable development; (ii) provision of legislative infrastructure; and (iii)\nin particular, mobilization of assistance from bilateral and multilateral financial institutions.4\n6. Since the Earth Summit, two ADB studies5 have concluded that progress on tackling\nenvironmental management problems has been inadequate. The Emerging Asia study in 1997\ngave a quantitative picture of the situation and pinpointed institutional and market failures as the\nkey barriers, and the Asian Environment Outlook 2001 elaborates on this. It identifies several\nspecific sectoral and economic development policies that stimulate environmental decline. It\nalso prescribes institutional, policy, and governance measures that would provide a sound basis\nfor concurrent improvement of environmental performance and poverty reduction in the region,\nincluding options and opportunities to redirect the current development trajectory implicated by\nthese driving forces. These ADB studies provide guidance for DMCs and international and\nbilateral  assistance  agencies  on  the  most  important  and  immediate  changes  that  can  be\nadopted by the region\u2019s policy makers, and on mainstreaming environmental concerns across\nand within sectors into all levels of poverty reduction and economic development planning,\nwhich should become a central theme of programs resulting from Rio+10.\n                  \n3  Negotiations of the implementing protocols of the conventions agreed at the Earth Summit (e.g., the Kyoto\nProtocol) were dominated by national interests. Unilateral decisions by one or more particular countries, which\nmay affect other countries, could be minimized through building subregional cooperation and consensus.\n4  As a first step of follow-up actions, ESCAP, together with the Government of Japan, conducted a study on\nindicators and designation of pilot projects in January 2001. A network secretariat will be established to help\nstakeholders formulate projects based on the assessment of pilot projects.\n5   (i) ADB. 1997. Emerging Asia: Changes and Challenges.

The consultations and dialogues with multilateral and bilateral financial institutions, and\nreview of the implementation of the Earth Summit's follow-up proposals indicate the necessity\nfor Rio+10 preparations to focus on facilitating implementation of approved actions. On the\nother hand, responsibility for preparations for Rio+10 in particular, and sustainable development\nplanning  in  general,  should  not  be  limited  to  environment  agencies.  Planning  and  finance\nagencies  and  other  stakeholders  need  to  be  fully  involved  in  preparing  initiatives.\nRepresentatives of DMCs and subregional organizations at the September 2000 Kitakyushu\nconference emphasized that collaboration and lesson-sharing for sustainable development will\nbe  more  effective  at  the  subregional  than  the  regional  level  due  to  similar  sociocultural\nbackgrounds and challenges for environmentally sound development. Addressing the common\nenvironmental problems at the subregional level will strengthen the DMCs\u2019 position at Rio+10 in\nthe  short  term  and  strengthen  cooperation  among  countries  in  the  subregions  to  more\neffectively address environmental problems in the longer term. Finally, activities need to be\ndesigned to integrate poverty reduction, social development, governance, and environmental\nimprovement  to  achieve  sustainable  development.  After  consultations,  ADB,  ESCAP,  and\nUNEP agreed that (i) preparatory activities will involve planning and finance agencies in the\nanalysis,  dialogue,  and  action  planning  from  the  outset;  (ii)  action  planning  will  be  on  a\nsubregional basis, building on national sustainable development plans; and (iii) an integrated\nand participatory approach will be taken in designing proposals involving multiple stakeholders.\nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n8. ADB,  ESCAP,  and  UNEP  have  agreed  to  help  DMCs  prepare  for  Rio+10  at  the\nsubregional level. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other international and\nregional organizations have expressed interest in coordinating their activities with the ADB-\nESCAP-UNEP  partnership.  Because  of  ADB's  comparative  advantage  through  ongoing\nenvironmental assistance programs, ADB will lead the subregional preparatory process for\nRio+10 in two subregions: Southeast Asia and Central Asia. ESCAP and UNEP will lead the\npreparatory process in the other subregions. Thus, the TA objectives are to help countries in\nSoutheast Asia and Central Asia subregions (i) establish subregional strategies, and develop an\nintegrated and participatory action plan that will be implemented in the medium and long term;\nand  (ii)  strengthen  subregional  cooperation  in  addressing  common  problems  and  poverty\nalleviation.\n9. This is the first time a subregional approach is being taken in establishing strategies for\nimplementing  the  Earth  Summit  recommendations,  and  developing  an  integrated  and\nparticipatory action plan. Consultations and related analyses will build on existing national\nsustainable development plans, national-level preparation that is being supported by UNDP,\nand other relevant reports. Subregional and regional action plans will present the outcome of\nconsultations with emphasis on mechanisms for implementation and on monitoring systems.\nThe  action  plans  will  delineate  priority  issues  and  major  challenges;  present  subregional\nplatforms and mechanisms outlining key policy issues, priorities, and follow-up actions to ensure\ncooperation; and prepare specific projects, including institutional and financial requirements, to\naddress the priority issues.\n10. The discussions at the national to global level will be brought together into four common\ngroupings: (i) rural poverty and the environment: the relationships among poverty, agriculture\nand  environment,  food  security,  social  dimensions  of  sustainable  development,  good  local\ngovernance, and financing; (ii) urban and industrial environment: the need to strengthen and", "4\nintegrate urban and industrial development management, slum upgrading, empowering of local\ngovernment and community, reduction of environmental health hazards (e.g., air and water\npollution),  and  adoption  of  clean  production  concepts  in  industrial  development  and  urban\nmanagement; (iii) natural resources management: consumption and production, environmental\nmanagement through efficient technologies and processes, economic instruments, long-term\nplanning  for  abatement  of  greenhouse  gas  effects  and  climate  change,  biodiversity,\nenvironmental  security,  other  sectoral  issues,  and  the  related  international  trade;  and  (iv)\ninstitutional and policy issues: strengthening of the global institutional framework for sustainable\ndevelopment, institutional reforms, coordination between the treaty regimes, and assessment of\nnational and local sustainability strategies.\nB. Scope\n11. The TA activities will include (i) compiling and reviewing reports from national-level\npreparation and other relevant reports including subregional environmental programs (e.g., the\nASEAN Environmental Action Plan), relevant regional TA reports and environmental projects\nfinanced by ADB, and evaluation and audit reports on selected projects and TAs undertaken by\nADB;  (ii)  preparing  subregional  analyses  and  an  action  plan  based  on  such  review  and\nconsultation  with  government  institutions  and  other  stakeholders  including  NGOs;  and  (iii)\norganizing a subregional preparatory process that includes discussions at the subregional level\ninvolving NGOs, the private sector, civil society, academia and other stakeholders active in\nenvironment and sustainable development, and subregional intergovernmental consultation to\ndiscuss and endorse the proposed subregional action plan.6 The subregional action plan will\nincorporate  stakeholders\u2019  inputs  and  be  endorsed  by  the  intergovernmental  meeting  for\npresentation in the Rio+10 Conference. This action plan will present subregional strategies and\nhelp  development  financial  institutions  to  identify  the  driving  forces  that  have  resulted  in\nenvironmental problems, and prepare specific programs to address the issues. Supplementing\nor (when necessary) adjusting the action plan accommodating Rio+10 recommendations will be\nundertaken by ADB, ESCAP, and UNEP in coordination with the concerned intergovernmental\norganizations through existing mechanisms. In ADB, the action plan will be used as input to\ncountry strategy and programs or their updates in consultation with the concerned governments\nof countries in the subregions.\n12. The  TA  will  (i)  develop  integrated  and  participatory  subregional  action  plans;  (ii)\nstrengthen ownership of the plans by a multistakeholder group including government, financial\nand sector development agencies; the private sector; academia; and civil society; (iii) achieve a\nstronger negotiating position for DMCs through subregional participation at Rio+10; and (iv)\nestablish  a  mechanism  for  feedback  and  commitment  from  countries  to  ensure  that  their\nnational positions will be consistent with the agreed upon subregional position and reflected in\ntheir governments\u2019 plans and strategies. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. The background\non global, regional, and subregional preparatory processes for Rio+10 is in Appendix 2.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The TA is estimated to cost $500,000. ADB will finance $200,000 equivalent, on a grant\nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. ESCAP has confirmed\navailability of $100,000; and UNEP, $200,000. The cost estimates include consulting services,\n                  \n6  The intergovernmental meeting will be attended by representatives of key government agencies in environment,\nfinance,  and  planning.  The  discussions  with  nongovernment  stakeholders  will  take  place  prior  to  the\nintergovernmental meeting to assure that the outcomes will be considered during the intergovernmental meeting.", "5\nregional workshops, reporting and publications, and secretarial support. UNEP\u2019s contribution will\ninclude in-kind support covering office space and technical staff resources and other facilities in-\nkind, totaling $50,000. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n14. The TA will be implemented as a partnership between ADB, ESCAP, and UNEP. A\nsteering committee of senior officials of the three agencies has been established to guide the\nsubregional  preparation  for  Rio+10.  ADB  is  represented  by  the  manager  of  Environment\nDivision,  ESCAP  by  the  director  of  its  Environment  and  Natural  Resource  Development\nDivision, and UNEP by the director of its Regional Resource Center for Asia and the Pacific. A\ntask force with one member from each of the three agencies has also been established to\nundertake the works under the TA. A task manager will be selected by the steering committee to\nhead the task force. A secretariat for daily TA implementation will be established in Bangkok,\nThailand with general independence from the three agencies but under the overall guidance of\nthe steering committee. The task force will focus on assisting at the subregional level. The TA\nwill be implemented in eight months, from August 2001 to March 2002. ADB will execute the TA\nin partnership with ESCAP and UNEP pursuant to the terms of an implementation agreement to\nbe signed by each of the three entities prior to commencement of TA activities.\n15. An international consultant (two person-months) will be engaged to support the day-to-\nday tasks of ADB in the Task Force. The consultant will have expertise in environmental\nmanagement,  a  thorough  understanding  of  international  conventions  and  treaties,  and\nexperience with implementing national economic development programs and projects. Domestic\nconsultants will be engaged by the task force for each subregion in consultation with ADB (a\ntotal of four person-months). They will help the task force prepare the draft subregional reports.\nThe consultants financed by the ADB TA grant will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the\nengagement of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are\nin Appendix 4. ADB will be responsible for procuring materials under the TA. However, ADB\nmay agree on arrangements with the secretariat, when appropriate, to carry out procurement\nsatisfactory to ADB and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n16.  ADB, ESCAP, and UNEP will monitor and periodically review the progress of TA\nimplementation  by  the  task  force  through  monthly  progress  reports.  ADB  will  review  the\ninception, interim, and draft final reports, and attend at least one subregional workshop.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$200,000 for the purpose of the Ten Years After Rio: Promoting Subregional Cooperation for\nSustainable Development Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nGoal\nEstablish subregional strategies, and Regional environmental improvement Close liaison with the TA secretariat in Consensus and commitment of countries\nstrengthen subregional cooperation in arising from strengthened subregional monitoring progress of TA in the subregion to establish subregional\naddressing common problems and cooperation through adoption of implementation, and communication strategies and promote regional\nissues. subregional policy, projects, and action with ESCAP and UNEP\u2019s regional office cooperation can be reached.\nplans. in Bangkok.\nPurpose\nDevelop subregional action plans Time-bound action plans, subregional Review of subregional reports, record of Subregional reports will be used by the\n(Southeast Asia and Central Asia) in commitment to implement the plans, presentation at Rio+10, and monitoring concerned subregions for Rio+10, and\n( environmental management to and earmarking of funds by of decisions made by subregions, as DMCs will implement the project\nR\naddress common problems through governments and development well as subregional cooperation in proposals and action plan presented in\ne\nfe subregional cooperation. financial institutions. implementing the action plans. subregional reports.\nr\ne\nn\nc Outputs\ne Subregional programs in addressing Well-received subregional reports ADB, ESCAP, and UNEP will monitor Subregional consensus can be reached\n \nin common problems (rural poverty/ covering integrated and participatory and record presentation of the reports in in addressing common issues, strategies\n \nte environment, urban and industrial action plans, and coownership of the Rio+10, and implementation of the to address the issues, and priorities.\nxt environment, natural resource reports by finance and planning action plans. 6\n:\n p management, and institutional issues) agencies, and stakeholders; and DMC governments will use the materials\na in an integrated and participatory statements on subregional produced by the TA.\ng\ne action plan. cooperation.\n \n4 Finance and planning agencies will adopt\n,\n \np the action plan.\na\nr\na\n.

Background\n1.  The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) has\nbecome a milestone in addressing increasing environmental problems that may endanger the\nearth\u2019s life support system. In view of this, the 55th Session of the United Nations General\nAssembly  (UNGA)  called  for  a  ten-year  review  of  progress  achieved  in  implementing  the\nUNCED\u2019s recommendations, and follow-up action proposals in the forthcoming United Nations\n(UN) World Summit on Sustainable Development (Rio+10).\nB. International Level\n \n1. Decision of the 55th Session of the United Nations General Assembly\n2.  The UNGA decided to (i) hold Rio+10 in Johannesburg, South Africa in September\n2002; (ii) organize the 10-year review of progress in implementing Agenda 21 to reinforce the\nglobal commitment to sustainable development; (iii) launch a preparatory process to establish a\nprovisional agenda and possible themes for Rio+10 at the regional and subregional levels\nthrough  the  Commission  on  Sustainable  Development  (CSD);  and  (iv)  ensure  a  balance\nbetween  economic  development,  social  development,  and  environmental  protection\n(interdependent  and  mutually  reinforcing  components  of  sustainable  development)  through\nRio+10, including its preparatory process.\n2. Global Preparatory Process\n3.  The  UNGA  invited  the  UN  Secretariat  and  relevant  organizations,  agencies,  and\nprograms  from  within  and  outside  the  UN  system  to  support  preparatory  activities  in  a\ncoordinated and mutually reinforcing way. These include the United Nations Environmental\nProgramme (UNEP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), regional commissions\nand secretariats of conventions related to UNCED, and international and regional financial\ninstitutions (e.g., the Global Environment Facility).\n4.  The UNGA also encouraged effective contributions from, and active participation of, all\nmajor groups identified in Agenda 21 at all stages of the preparatory process. International-level\npreparations will include a series of (i) CSD meetings in its function as the summit preparatory\ncommittee, and (ii) global meetings of stakeholders to be organized and coordinated by the\nCSD Secretariat in collaboration with various partners. Four meetings planned by CSD for the\nRio+10 preparations include the first (30 April-2 May 2001), second (late January 2002) and\nthird (late March 2002) preparatory committee meetings at the UN headquarters, New York; and\nthe Fourth Preparatory Committee Meeting (May 2002) in Indonesia.\n3. Regional and Subregional Preparatory Processes\n5.  Two key regional preparatory processes designed by UNGA are the: (i) stakeholders\u2019\nmeetings at the regional and subregional levels, consisting of nongovernment organizations, the\nprivate sector, civil society, community-based organizations, academia, and other stakeholders\nactive  in  the  field  of  sustainable  development;  and  (ii)  intergovernmental  meetings  at  the\nregional and subregional levels. These regional and subregional preparatory meetings will be\nundertaken  by  various  UN  agencies  in  cooperation  with  multilateral  and  bilateral  financial\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 12)", "9 Appendix 2, page 2\ninstitutions. The stakeholders\u2019 meetings will take place prior to the intergovernmental meetings\nto assure that their outcome will be considered during the intergovernmental meetings. The\nsubregional and regional reports should be available by January 2002 for the first substantive\nCSD meeting. The regional and subregional preparatory meetings will undertake two main\ntasks:\n(i)  develop (a) regional assessments on the main achievements in implementing\nAgenda  21  and  other  outcomes  of  UNCED,  including  major  regional,\nsubregional,  and  national  initiatives  toward  sustainable  development;  (b)\nprospective  outlooks  and  main  constraints;  and  (c)  new  initiatives  and\ncommitments to overcome constraints and foster further progress; and\n(ii)  formulate regional platforms outlining key policy issues, priorities, and follow-up\naction  proposals,  including  specific  proposals  to  strengthen  or  raise  the\neffectiveness of international cooperation and international institutions.\nC. The Asia and Pacific Region\n1. Five Subregions of Asia and the Pacific\n6.  Asia and the Pacific is the world\u2019s most populated region. Because of its vastness and\ndiversity in terms of geography, topography, climate, ecology, and other natural conditions, as\nwell as differences in sociocultural, economic, and political systems, the region is grouped into\nfive subregions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, Northwest Pacific, Central Asia, and South Pacific\n(with Australia and New Zealand).\n7.  The subregions have a history of cooperation in the environmental sector either through an\nintergovernmental agency or directly through South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation,\nand South Asia Cooperative Environment Programme for South Asia; Association of South East\nAsian  Nations  (ASEAN)  for  Southeast  Asia;  and  South  Pacific  Regional  Environmental\nProgramme  (SPREP)  for  South  Pacific.  Intergovernmental  action  programs  include  the\nNortheast  Asia  Subregional  Programme  on  Environmental  Cooperation,  and  Central  Asian\nRegional Environment Action Plan. The technical assistance (TA) will cover two subregions\n(Southeast Asia and Central Asia) while the other subregions will be covered with assistance\nfrom the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and UNEP.\n2. Rio+10 Preparation Partnership\n8.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), ESCAP, and UNEP have agreed to help prepare\nfor Rio+10 on an equal partnership basis.  A steering committee and task force with senior\nofficials from the three agencies have been established. Each agency has designated a senior\nstaff member to the task force. A task manager will be selected by the steering committee to\nhead the task force. A secretariat for daily TA implementation will be established in Bangkok.\nThis agreement will be communicated to concerned governments, and subregional, regional,\nand global concerned agencies bearing the three agencies\u2019 logos. The task force is responsible\nfor substantive and logistical arrangements.\n3. Subregional and Regional Preparations\n9.  At  the  subregional  level,  the  three  agencies  will  work  with  and  build  on\nintergovernmental bodies and existing cooperation mechanisms. A comprehensive report for", "10 Appendix 2, page 3\neach subregion will be prepared based on a common guideline. The report will be composed of\ntwo parts, 20 percent being \"Review and Evaluation\u201d and 80 percent being \u201cMechanisms for\nImplementation.\u201d\n(i)  The \u201cReview and Evaluation \u201d section will cover (a) main achievements and\nlessons  learned  in  implementing  Agenda  21  and  other  UNCED\nrecommendations;  (b)  major  constraints  and  time-bound  measures;  (c)\ninstitutional and financial requirements and opportunities; (d) new initiatives and\ncommitments toward overcoming constraints and fostering progress; (e) linkage\nof the subregional program with regional initiatives; and (f) ways to strengthen\nthe  institutional  framework  for  sustainable  development,  focusing  on  action-\noriented decisions.\n(ii)  The \u201cMechanisms for Implementation\u201d section will cover (a) priority issues and\nassessment of major challenges, (b) regional action program, (c) subregional\nplatforms and mechanisms outlining key policy issues, (d) priorities and follow-up\nactions to ensure cooperation, and (e) project proposals on institutional and\nfinancial requirements to address the priority issues.\n10.  The  report  will  be  reviewed  in  a  discussion  involving  major  stakeholders  at  the\nsubregional level. The five subregional reports will be consolidated into a regional synthesis\nreport.  The  latter  will  be  reviewed  by  major  stakeholders  in  a  meeting,  followed  by  an\nintergovernmental  meeting.  The  reports  and  their  preparatory  processes  will  (i)  involve\nconsultation and engagement of environment, finance, and planning agencies; (ii) focus on\nidentification  and  analysis,  and  facilitate  implementing  mechanisms  to  address  the  priority\nissues; and (iii) engage informal networks for advise and consultation.\n4.
