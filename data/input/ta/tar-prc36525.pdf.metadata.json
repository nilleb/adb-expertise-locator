INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) during the 2002 Country Programming Mission to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to strengthen the PRC\u2019s external public debt management and examine the \nfeasibility of consolidating its external and domestic public debt management (PDM) functions. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objective,  scope,  cost,  and \nfinancing and implementation arrangements of the TA during a Fact-Finding mission in August \n2002. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   The PRC\u2019s public debt market is relatively small, but it is growing at a significant rate. Its \ntotal domestic and external public debt stood at $270 billion or 25.1% of gross domestic product \n(GDP) at the end of 2000, in comparison with a ratio close to 70% in Malaysia, Singapore, or \nthe Republic of Korea. Of the total debt outstanding, the domestic public debt (raised through \nthe issuance of treasury bonds) accounted for RMB1.367 trillion ($165.3 billion) or 15.3% of \nGDP and the external public and publicly guaranteed debt amounted to $104.7 billion (9.6% of \nGDP)  at  the  end  of  2000.2 Of  that  amount,  multilateral  debt  was  $26.3  billion,  official \ndevelopment  assistance  from  bilateral  sources  amounted  to  $24.6  billion,  and  outstanding \nsovereign bonds issued stood at $12.3 billion.  \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s debt markets are characterized by a number of other specific features. \nDemand for debt in the financial system is high, given PRC\u2019s high savings rate above 40% of \nGDP, matched only by Singapore and Malaysia in the region. Domestic investors perceive the \ncountry risks to be relatively low, as evident from a number of indicators including (i) high \nforeign exchange reserves at $250 billion, sufficient to cover 11 months of imports; (ii) low \nexternal debt equivalent to 25% of the foreign exchange reserves, and 57% in relation to foreign \nexchange income; (iii) favorable maturity profile with less than 30% of overall external debt with \nshort maturity; and (iv) low repayment burden, as debt service payments account for less than \n8% of foreign exchange income.  \n \n4.  At present, three organizations play a major role in determining and managing public \ndebt, namely, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), \nand  the  State  Administration  of  Foreign  Exchange  (SAFE).  All  operate  under  the  overall \nsupervision of the State Council. MOF has the lead role in domestic public debt determination, \nissuance as well as management, and it shares responsibility with SDPC in authorizing the \nissuance of publicly guaranteed debt. MOF and People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) coordinate on \nthe quantity, pricing as well as maturity structure of domestic debt. SDPC is responsible for \nmonitoring and analyzing the domestic corporate bond market.   \n \n5.  With regard to the external public debt, SDPC and MOF jointly authorize new multilateral \nand bilateral loans in line with overall development planning objectives and priorities. They \ncoordinate closely with the borrowing entities and undertake feasibility analysis of the projects \nproposed for external financing. After projects are approved, SDPC remains involved primarily \nin monitoring disbursements and repayments, and MOF performs the actual PDM functions.   \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 August 2002. \n2  The overall external debt of the PRC stood at $145.7 billion in 2000, then rose to $170.1 billion in 2001 due to a \nfourfold increase in short-term debt. ", "2 \n6.  SAFE, established as a special body reporting to the State Council, is responsible for \nmonitoring and controlling the movement of foreign capital, to ensure that the foreign exchange \nresources of the country are maintained at an appropriate level. At present, the deputy governor \nof PBC serves concurrently as the director general of SAFE. Under its regulations, SAFE \ngoverns  the  flow  of  foreign  funds,  namely,  onlending  arrangements,  and  reporting  and \nmonitoring of all foreign currency related statistics. SAFE\u2019s primary responsibility is to register all \nforeign currency transactions of public and private entities, including loans and foreign direct \ninvestment inflows, and to authorize subsequent repayment of debt and repatriation of profits in \nforeign exchange.  \n \n7.  Within MOF, four departments play key roles. At the apex, the Budget Department \nforecasts resource requirements, including borrowing needs. The International Department (ID) \nis responsible for negotiating, concluding, and administering all multilateral loans, while the \nFinance Department (FD) negotiates and administers all official development assistance and \ncommercial external public debt. The Treasury Department (TD) is responsible for planning, \nissuance, and administration of domestic public debt.3 In addition to the treasury, the three \nstate-owned  policy  banks,  namely  the  State  Development  Bank  of  China,  the  Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank of China, and China Export-Import Bank, have also issued financial bonds \nsince 1990. While the initial volumes were miniscule, these bonds picked up in 1996\u2013when the \nissuance amounted to RMB100 billion\u2013and rose steadily to almost RMB200 billion by 2000. \nGiven  the  ownership  structures  of  the  policy  banks,  their  debt  is  categorized  as  quasi \ngovernment liabilities. As of 2000, the State Development Bank of China issued close to two \nthirds of the debt of all the policy banks combined. While a majority of the debt issued is in the \ndomestic markets, the policy banks also issue dollar-and yen-denominated bonds abroad. \n \n8.  ID is responsible for maintaining an onlending database for external loans, and their \nservicing in a timely manner. About 90% of all external loans are onlent to special-purpose \nentities, ministries, state-owned enterprises, or provincial agencies that coordinate projects. \nBilateral loans are disbursed through a network of state-owned commercial banks, which also \nhave servicing responsibilities. Every quarter, the commercial banks report to FD with project-\nlevel information, including disbursements, repayments, and outstanding balances on all onlent \nbilateral  loans.  FD,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  has  also  been  responsible  for  issuing \ninternational bonds, 12 times since 1993, with an average tenure of 10 years and actual \nmaturity ranging upwards of 5 years. The agencies concerned periodically share information for \nreporting and monitoring purposes. \n \n9.  Although these institutional arrangements have to some extent been streamlined, the \noverall approach to PDM has a number of constraints. First, PDM is fragmented across a \nnumber  of  agencies,  and  the  policy  and  legal  framework  governing  PDM  remains  weak. \nAlthough debt sustainability is not a major concern in the near future, there is no ongoing in-\ndepth macroeconomic analysis to determine debt requirements over the medium and long term. \nSecond, there is a lack of transparency in the process of issuance of Government guarantees. \nThere is also lack of information in determining what is guaranteed. In addition, while most of \nthe debt has been sub-contracted by state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, there is \nno systematic approach within the overall budgetary framework to deal with contingent liabilities. \nAs a result, overall liabilities are underestimated, and it presents a misleading picture to the \nState Council, the National People\u2019s Congress, and the general public.  \n                                                 \n3  The issuance of treasury bonds (including marketable bonds and savings bonds) has grown rapidly in the PRC in \nrecent years, from less than RMB20 billion ($41 million in nominal terms) in 1990 to RMB400 billion ($500 million in \nnominal terms) by 2000. ", "    3 \n10.  Third, the policy and regulatory fragmentation is compounded by constraints in the legal \nframework. Under current legislation, provincial governments cannot run budgets with deficits; \nhence they are not empowered to engage in domestic or external borrowings. However, the \ngovernments can establish special\u2013purpose entities\u2013with separate administrative structure and \nfinancial responsibilities\u2013to borrow funds and administer projects. The responsibility for final \nsettlement  and  repayment  of  the  obligations  rests  with  ID.  Any  payments  by  the  central \nGovernment,  in  cases  when  project  entities  cannot  repay  on  time,  are  netted  out  of  the \nintergovernmental transfers from the center to the provinces. These adjustments in transfers \noccur at substantial real as well as opportunity costs, as due to poor planning, funds earmarked \nfor specific projects may be diverted to repay debts. The ultimate debt liabilities are implicitly \nborne  by  the  provinces,  but  are  not  directly  reflected  in  their  budgets.  The  situation  is \naggravated by the practice of many local governments, which have accumulated implicit debt \nobligations through various forms of public guarantees.  \n \n11.  Fourth, the framework for risk management is weak. The fragmented approach to PDM \ndoes not provide timely data to support sound asset-and-liability management (ALM), and the \nanalytical capacity to assess the impact of interest rate or exchange rate changes on the \nGovernment\u2019s asset and liability positions is limited. For instance, while FD engages in swap \ntransactions to cushion the shocks of foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, it does so \non an ad hoc case-by-case basis, and not on a portfolio basis. As the Central Government\u2019s \nbudget does not include all Government guaranteed debt and the debt servicing costs, MOF \nand the other agencies do not have a complete profile of the overall debt liabilities and the \npotential future fiscal implications. \n \n12.  Fifth, the macroeconomic framework and debt policy formulation are not necessarily \nconsistent with overall fiscal deficit planning and forecasting. In view of the large restructuring \ncosts of the banking sector and state-owned enterprises as well as the implicit pension liabilities, \nit  is  essential  that  the  Government  develop  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  State \nguarantees and contingent liabilities and integrate it with the overall medium-and long-term \nfiscal planning.  \n \n13.  Sovereign debt management has long been a major part of fiscal planning in developed \nas well as developing countries. Recently, many countries, including Australia, New Zealand, \nand United Kingdom, have established separate PDM offices. The Commonwealth Secretariat \nhas coordinated joint initiatives to improve PDM in the commonwealth bloc. The World Bank \n(WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have adopted guidelines on PDM in 2001. \n \n14.  The Government has requested an advisory TA from ADB to strengthen PRC\u2019s external \nPDM, and to assess the prospects for consolidating its domestic as well as external PDM \nfunctions under one umbrella. This proposed TA will be implemented in close coordination with \na separate TA being provided by ADB to support the Government to reform macroeconomic-\nfiscal policy coordination and budget execution. WB provided TA support in 2000 on debt \nmanagement, which recommended the consolidation of all existing MOF databases into a single \nsource, and MOF is now in the process of procuring hardware and software to upgrade its \nstatistics system. No other external support is envisaged in the near future. The proposed TA \nwill build on the findings of the WB TA. \n \n15.  MOF recognizes that efforts to rationalize the institutional and regulatory fragmentation, \nand consolidate the external and domestic PDM functions are critical, to effectively reform the \nPDM system in PRC. MOF views the TA as an essential building bloc to launch an in-depth \nassessment of the feasibility of achieving such consolidation, based on experiences in other ", "4 \ncountries. High-level discussions with the Government will be undertaken to ensure that the \nfindings of the TA are fully utilized in policy and institutional changes in this area in the future.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n16.  The goal of the TA is to strengthen PDM in the PRC. The purpose is to assess the \ncurrent policy, institutional, legal, and regulatory arrangements for external debt management; \nformulate debt management guidelines that are consistent with international practices; and \ndevelop a blueprint to consolidate all PDM functions into a single unified framework. The \noutputs of the TA will include (i) assessments and recommendations for strengthening the \nmanagement of external public debt; and (ii) a comprehensive report that discusses various \noptions for streamlining PDM functions, including the establishment of a PDM office.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.     The TA will undertake specific activities in three areas. \n1.  Strengthen  the  Current  Policy  and  Institutional  Framework  for  External \nPDM \n(i)  Evaluate the objectives of the PRC\u2019s external PDM policy framework and \nits linkage to medium-term macroeconomic planning and forecasting. \n \n(ii)  Assess the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for external PDM, \nwith focus on intra- and inter-agency coordination among MOF, SDPC, \nPBC, and SAFE; assess the costs or losses incurred due to segmented \nregulation; and evaluate whether the external PDM framework recognizes \nan appropriate interface between commercial and public policy interests.  \n \n(iii)  Assess current approaches to and institutional capacity for research and \nanalysis  of  various  options  for  managing  terms  of  sovereign  debt, \nincluding  maturity  structure,  foreign  currency  exposure  in  relation  to \nforeign  exchange  income  and  reserves,  linkage  with  put/call  options, \ndownstream and onlending arrangements, implicit or explicit contingent \nliabilities, and determination of guarantees. \n \n(iv)  Examine risk management focusing on the exchange rate as well as \ninterest rate risks, ALM systems, as well as performance measurement \nmethods adopted by various agencies. \n \n2.  Establish Benchmark Debt Management Guidelines \n(i)  Formulate external PDM guidelines based on an evaluation of the PRC\u2019s \nadherence to the international guidelines on PDM. \n \n(ii)  Organize capacity-building initiatives, for key officials engaged in external \nPDM - these programs will involve domestic and international seminars \nand study visits to selected developed and developing economies with \nadvanced PDM practices. ", "    5 \n3.  Formulate a Sound Institutional Framework for PDM \n(i)  Design a blueprint for a consolidated framework to guide PDM, including \na  draft  document  outlining  (a)  the  objectives  of  PDM;  its  approach,  \norientation, and operating principles; (b) an appropriate organizational \nstructure,  indicating  clear  front-middle-and  back-office  functions; \n(c) financing  arrangements,  set  out  against  the  anticipated  costs  and \nbenefits of consolidating all PDM functions; and (d) an evaluation and \nmeasurement  system  to  guide  strategic  decision-making  on  quantity, \npricing, and maturity of public debt. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, of which $298,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $202,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$102,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the \nlocal currency cost, equivalent to $100,000, through the provision of counterpart and workshop \nfacilities. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan of the TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will engage a team of consultants, recruited individually, in accordance with the \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  selecting  domestic \nconsultants, to provide a total of 17 person-months of services: 7 international and 10 domestic. \nConsultants will have expertise in policy, legal, and regulatory issues pertaining to PDM. The \nterms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  ID will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for all interagency \ncoordination issues. ID will establish a project steering committee, comprising director generals \nof ID, TD, FD, and Budget Department within MOF, and appropriate officials from SAFE, SDPC, \nand PBC. This committee will review outputs and provide overall guidance, and ensure effective \ninteragency coordination. The TA is expected to start in February 2003 and will be implemented \nover a period of 10 months.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strengthening Public Debt Management, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.
