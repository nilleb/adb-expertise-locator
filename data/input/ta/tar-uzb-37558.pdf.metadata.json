The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the policy and legal framework for foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) in order to establish a more favorable environment to attract FDI. In response \nto the request,  the fact-finding mission visited Tashkent  in  August 2003 and reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA.1 The logical framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Foreign Direct Investment. It is widely recognized that FDI has played an increasingly \nimportant role in the economic development in recipient countries as FDI offers a number of \nadvantages. Besides providing financial resources, FDI facilitates the transfer of intangible \nassets such as technology, skills, and management know-how, thereby helping directly boost \nproductivity, job creation, and economic growth. FDI can also help secure foreign market access \nand improve domestic producers\u2019 competitiveness. \n \n3.  The Government has long recognized the importance of FDI and started to promote FDI \nfrom the early period of the transition from  a centrally planned to market-based economy. \nHowever, Uzbekistan has yet to successfully  attract much  of FDI compared to other  former \nSoviet Union republics in spite of the country's abundant natural resources (e.g., oil and gas, \ngold and other raw materials, cotton and other agricultural products); skilled labor force; and a \npotentially large domestic market. To date, FDI to Uzbekistan  has amounted only to $850.0 \nmillion  compared  to  $14.5  billion  to  Kazakhstan.  For  the  last  few  years,  FDI  inflow  has \ndecreased further, with an estimated disbursement of only $65 million in 2002, down by about \n10% year on year according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Uzbekistan now has the \nlowest ratio of FDI to gross domestic product (GDP) in the former Soviet Union republics, and \nFDI per head is only about $6. \n \n4.  Privatization. FDI is not only crucial for employment generation and economic growth in \nUzbekistan but would also help accelerate privatization of state-owned enterprises. Government \ndata show that the private sector accounts for about 35% of GDP, and exports from small and \nmedium-sized enterprises contributed only about 5% of total export volume in 2002. Recently, \nthe Government published a new resolution on privatization to jump-start the process of selling \nstate  assets  in  line  with  private  sector  development.  Considering  that  domestic  financial \ninstitutions  remain  underdeveloped  and  are  unable  to  mobilize  savings  to  support  the \nprivatization program, the success of the Government's renewed privatization efforts largely \ndepends on FDI.  \n \n5.  Foreign  Direct  Investment  Promotion  Strategy.  As  developed  and  developing \neconomies increasingly recognize the importance of FDI, they progressively compete for FDI. \nRecipient countries have thus switched from a regulatory to a promotional approach to attract \nFDI. As of today, most recipient countries have already moved from the first generation of \ninvestment promotion (mainly opening up their economies to FDI) to the second generation (the \nrecipient countries actively \"market\" their location). The establishment of investment promotion \nagencies (IPAs) in many recipient countries reflects this trend. 2 However, Uzbekistan has yet to \n                                                 \n1  The TA is first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 August 2003.  \n2  A 2001 survey by United Nation Conference on Trade and Development showed that there are currently 164 \nnational level investment promotion agencies. ", "2 \nestablish such an agency. Crucial information needed by foreign investors to make investment \ndecisions and establish businesses is not readily available.  \n \n6.  The Government\u2019s efforts have been limited only to advertising potential areas of FDI, \nmainly through publications. In order to considerably improve FDI promotion, there is a need to \ndevelop a strategy accommodating investment  requirements and conditions. An investment \npromotion  strategy  should  use  a  range  of  promotional  activities  such  as  image  building, \ninvestment generation, and investor servicing. Following international practice, the Government \nwill need to explore the establishment of an IPA as a part of the strategy. \n \n7.  Legal and Regulatory Framework. Another constraint on FDI promotion is weak legal \nframework.  The  Law  on  Foreign  Investments  and  on  Guarantees  and  Measures for the \nProtection of Rights of Foreign Investors3, the \"Foreign Investment Laws (FIL)\", provides the \nlegal framework for FDI. FIL defines the types of entities in which foreigners are allowed to \ninvest, conditions governing repatriation of profits and earnings, and general rights of foreign \ninvestors and  guarantees on their investment. The significant  guarantee for an entity with \nforeign investment is contained in the FIL that provides for protection against adverse changes \nin the law for 10 years following registration. To supplement FIL, a number of decrees have \nbeen issued. However,  these are discretionary and often have no effective date. In fact, a \nnumber of these decrees apply only to individual firms. As a result, many decrees are often \nconflicting and create confusion both to firms and tax authorities.  \n \n8.  To  address  the  weaknesses  of  the  regulatory  framework  and  ensure  appropriate \nprotection for foreign investors, the Government created the Department for Legal Protection \n(DLP) of Foreign Investments and Entities with Foreign Investment under the Ministry of Justice \n(MOJ) in 2003. However, DLP has experienced difficulties in effectively fulfilling its tasks due to \nweak capacity of its staff and the complexity of regulations and decrees. Assistance is needed \nto develop a consistent and comprehensive legal framework for FDI in the context of long-term \nprivate sector development and to improve MOJ\u2019s capacity to strengthen the legal framework.  \n  \n9.   This  TA  will  help  the  Government  foster  and  sustain  economic  growth  through \nenhanced  resource  mobilization  by  promoting  greater  capital  inflows  and  better  FDI \nmanagement. This will improve the country's integration into world finance and trade and \neventually reduce the country\u2019s dependency on foreign assistance. This TA is consistent with \nADB's strategic  objectives of private sector development and good governance.  No other \ndevelopment partner has been involved in promoting FDI in Uzbekistan, however, care will be \ntaken to ensure extensive consultation with major development partners including the World \nBank,  International  Finance  Corporation,  and  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment, to address concerns they may have regarding constraints in FDI in the country. \n \nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The purpose of the TA  is to assist the Government in its efforts to effectively promote \nFDI by (i) creating a conducive policy environment for FDI, (ii) establishing a legal framework to \nensure protection of foreign investors, and (iii) strengthening capacity of government agencies \nconcerned. \n \n                                                 \n3  Adopted on 30 April 1998. ", "    3 \n11.  The output will include the following:  \n \n(i)  FDI-related policy assessment and recommendations,  \n(ii)  establishment of legal protection for  foreign investments and  entities with foreign \ninvestment, \n(iii)  medium-term strategy to promote FDI, \n(iv)  upgraded repository of FDI regulatory acts, and  \n(v)  officials trained in FDI promotion and protection. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  will  provide  for  extensive  consultation  with  the  private  sector  and  other \ndevelopment institutions. In the course of developing recommendations, a workshop with high-\nlevel government officials and international experts will be conducted to facilitate government \nownership. The TA will organize a 1-day conference to disseminate TA output. The TA activities \nare summarized below. \n \n13.  Policy  and  Institutional  Framework.  The  TA  will  assess  current  institutional \narrangements, policies, and practices to identify major impediments to FDI. Since a number of \ngovernment agencies are involved with FDI-related policy, a thorough assessment of roles and \nrelations among them will provide recommendations on operational aspects of facilitating FDI. \nBased on the study results, the TA will provide recommendation on overall foreign investment \npolicy situations and procedures to create a conducive environment for FDI with a medium-term \nstrategy to proactively promote FDI. The recommended strategy will include the schemes to \nestablish an IPA for FDI. \n \n14.  Legal and Regulatory Framework. The TA will analyze existing legal and regulatory \nframeworks to identify weaknesses (including gaps and contradictions) and other potential legal \nconstraints on FDI. The assessment will be made on constitutional and legislative framework on \nforeign investment to determine whether amendments are necessary. The TA will identify the \ncritical legal impediments to protecting and attracting FDI; evaluate various options to remove \nthem; and recommend changes such as revision of laws, regulations, and decrees to harmonize \nthem. \n \n15.  Improving Capacity of the Department for Legal Protection. Based on the results of \nthe institutional and legal assessment, the TA will provide in-country trainings, and overseas \ntraining  to  improve  DLP\u2019s  capacity.  The  trainings  will  provide  government  officials  with \ninternational best practices and practical solutions identified  by the assessment. The TA will \nmake FDI-related legal case studies from key legal cases related to the FDI in Uzbekistan in \norder to develop domestically applicable reference materials. Together with case studies, the \npreparation and implementation  of  trainings  will  produce a repository of international best \npractices and reference materials on FDI. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $430,000 equivalent, including foreign \nexchange cost of $242,000, and local currency cost of $188,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $300,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost of \n$242,000 and $58,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will contribute \n$130,000 in kind for office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services. The TA ", "4 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates are \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangement \n17.  MOJ will be the  Executing Agency for  the TA. DLP under MOJ and the Agency for \nForeign Economic Relations will be the implementing agencies. The MOJ will also provide office \nspace, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services to consultants and will arrange \nappointments for them with relevant agencies and organizations.  \n \n18.  The TA will engage a team of two international consultants for a total of  6 person-\nmonths: one team leader\u2014an economist and FDI specialist (3 person-months); and a legal \nspecialist (3 person-months). The domestic consultants (18 person-months) will have the same \nset  of  expertise  as  the  international  consultants  and  information  technology  areas.  The \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be recruited individually \nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consulting Services and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. Equipment will \nbe procured by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n19.   The consultants will submit  (i) inception reports 2 weeks after services start; (ii) interim \nprogress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation; (iii) draft final reports before \nconclusion of the contract; and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after incorporating MOJ\u2019s and ADB's \ncomments. The TA is expected to commence in March 2004 and be completed by August 2004. \nA 1-day conference will be organized near the end of implementation to invite comments from \ninternational and domestic experts in the field and disseminate the report findings.  \n \n \nIII.
