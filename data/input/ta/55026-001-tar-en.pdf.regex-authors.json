INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) enhance gender equality and women\u2019s capacity to participate in the labor market \nby strengthening the policy framework for childcare services.1 The TA will produce knowledge \nproducts and promote institutional capacity strengthening for social service delivery.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Persistent gender inequalities. Chinese women\u2019s labor force participation has been on \na steady decline since 1990, falling to 61.5% in 2017.3 Women\u2019s disproportionate burden of \nunpaid care responsibilities both impedes their ability to seek work outside the home and affects \ntheir fertility decisions. To address these interrelated challenges, the government\u2019s 14th Five-\nYear Plan, 2021\u20132025 aims to improve family welfare policies and access to quality childcare \nservices as an urgent priority.4 \n \n3.  Unmet demand for quality childcare services. One part of the government\u2019s response \nto the falling birthrate was to replace the long-standing one child policy in 2016 with a new policy \nencouraging  couples  to  have  two  children.5 The  ensuing  increase  in  the  birthrate  has \nexacerbated the unmet demand for affordable, high-quality childcare services. A United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) demand analysis estimated that up to one-third of Chinese parents \nwish to access childcare services, but only about 5% of the 47.5 million children aged 0\u20132 are \ncurrently enrolled, indicating a shortage of about 10 million childcare spaces.6 There are two \ndirect causes of unmet demand: (i) a shortage of total supply of childcare services, and (ii) \ninstitutional capacity gaps for quality childcare service delivery. During the 2 decades following \nthe start of economic reform and opening up in 1978, the public nurseries that had been widely \noperated by state-owned institutions and enterprises were gradually closed down to align with \nmarket-oriented reforms. By the late 1990s, there were almost no public nurseries left, and \nprivate provision now dominates. Because of cost barriers, most young children are looked after \nby their families until they can start pre-primary education at age 3. Inadequate access to \nchildcare services is linked to low levels of public investment, inaccurate demand analysis, and \nthe imbalance between private and public provision. Quality issues stem primarily from a lack of \nregulation and supervision plus weak human resources and staffing. A key issue in human \nresources is that the devaluation of female-dominated occupations influences public perceptions \nof care work\u2019s value, skill need, and status. In addition, there are no industry standards in place, \nand there are capacity gaps among policy makers. The unmet demand for childcare services \nhas stark implications for women\u2019s labor force participation and fertility decisions. \n \n1  Childcare services are aimed at children aged 0\u20132, and are also referred to as daycare, cr\u00e8ches, or nurseries. \nChinese children attend kindergarten from ages 3 to 5, also known as pre-primary or early childhood education. \nTogether, childcare and kindergarten are referred to as early childhood education and care. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on 17 \nAugust 2021. \n3  In 1990, the women\u2019s labor force participation rate was 73.2% (footnote 5). \n4  Government of the PRC. 2021.

The policy shift toward \nencouraging more children has amplified the work\u2013family conflict for women in light of the \nshortage of affordable, high-quality childcare services, and studies find that compared to those \nwith one child, women with two children are more likely to sacrifice employment and career \nadvancement for family responsibilities (footnote 5). This is partially explained by the difficulty of \ncombining paid and unpaid work in the context of rapid urbanization, and the decline of publicly \nsubsidized urban childcare services. The availability of affordable out-of-home childcare options \nincreases the likelihood that mothers will participate in the labor force.7 It is more difficult for \nwomen to combine paid work with caregiving responsibilities in cities, where the workplace is \nseparated from the home and work schedules are more rigid. The lack of access to affordable \nchildcare in cities also causes family dislocation for migrant workers, with tens of millions of \nyoung children left behind to live with grandparents in home villages (footnote 5). A 2021 Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policy brief that highlights the importance of increasing women\u2019s \nparticipation in the labor market notes improved support for childcare among the measures that \nshould be implemented to achieve this.8 An increase in the supply of quality childcare services \nwould also create more decent work opportunities for women, who make up the majority of early \nchildhood education and care workers. \n \n5.  Childcare  services  and  women\u2019s  fertility  decisions.  Women\u2019s  choices  are \nconstrained when they have to choose between either work or children, and recent trends \nconfirm that women are having fewer children. The post-2016 spike in births quickly slowed: the \nnumber of new birth registrations fell from 17.2 million in 2017 to 11.2 million in 2019 and \n10.04 million in 2020,9 and the fertility rate has fallen precipitously to an average of 1.3 children \nper woman (footnote 8). The determinants of fertility choices are complex, but a 2020 study of \nnearly 1,000 parents who have one child identified two key factors in the intention to have a \nsecond: family income and access to quality education.10 The study highlighted that raising a \nchild has become very expensive with the prevailing high cost of living, long working hours, and \nburgeoning  childcare  expenses.  These  difficulties  have  also  come  to  light  in  the  public\u2019s \nresponse to the May 2021 policy shift allowing couples to have three children.11 Increasing \ngovernment support is key to increasing equitable access to childcare services, since purely \nprivate markets create cost barriers for lower-income families. Childcare centers in the PRC \nboomed from 2010 to 2020, but only about 20% are public and therefore more affordable\u2014\nfewer than one-third of families surveyed could afford private nurseries.12 A 2019 ADB analysis \nof inclusive growth in the PRC recommended that while the market serves well-off populations, \npublicly subsidized childcare should target children from disadvantaged groups to address their \nparents\u2019 investment deficits (footnote 5). \n \n6.  Policy framework. The policy framework for childcare services is relatively new, with \nthree high-level policy documents issued in 2019. These aim to (i) provide overall guidance and \nstandardize service delivery (May 2019), (ii) establish preferential tax policies and fees for \nservice providers (June 2019), and (iii) encourage the involvement of social forces in service \n \n7  F.

The plan envisions \ninclusive childcare services provided by urban kindergartens, new childcare centers, qualified \ncompanies and enterprises, and social organizations and other social forces. Targets by 2025 \ninclude (i) supporting 150 cities to use social forces to develop childcare centers and community \nchildcare service facilities, (ii) adding 500,000 demonstrative inclusive childcare centers, and \n(iii) increasing the number of childcare places to 4.5 per 1,000 population (compared to 1.8 in \n2020). \n \n7.  National good practices and international comparisons. Local governments have \ndeveloped their own policies to strengthen supervision of childcare, increase investment, and \ndevelop standards and regulations to promote sustainable and safe expansion. National case \nstudies can draw out good practices to help strengthen the national policy framework. Shanghai, \nfor example, rolled out a series of policies in April 2018, jointly issued by 16 departments of the \nmunicipal  government.  The  policies  establish  institutional  mechanisms  for  the  promotion, \nsupport, and management of childcare services. Within 1 year, Shanghai had set up more than \n170 new childcare centers providing services to more than 6,400 children.15 The PRC may also \nlearn from international good practices in childcare service delivery and financing. Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries spend on average slightly more \nthan 0.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) on early childhood education and care together, \nwith large variation across countries ranging from 1.8% in Iceland to 0.1% in Turkey.16 Most \nspend  more  on  early  childhood  education,  likely  a  reflection  of  higher  enrollment  rates. \nChildcare spending among all OECD countries is 0.2% of GDP on average, and highest at 1.1% \nof GDP in Sweden, followed by Iceland (0.9%), Norway (0.7%), France and Finland (0.6%), and \nthe Republic of Korea (0.5%).17 \n \n8.  Strategic alignment. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities \n1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities), 2 (accelerating progress in gender \nequality),  and  6  (strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity).  It  will  contribute  to \nSustainable Development Goal targets 4.2 (by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access \nto quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready \nfor primary education) and 5.4 (recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the \nprovision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of \nshared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate).18 The TA is \n \n13 Government of the PRC, State Council. 2019.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: childcare service needs satisfied.20 The TA \nwill  have  the  following  outcome:  policy  framework  to  strengthen  the  childcare  system  for \nchildren aged 0\u20132 improved.21 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Policy advice on strengthening childcare services finalized. Output 1 will \ndesign a policy framework for the childcare system, considering the country\u2019s current policy \nsystem and local practices as well as national conditions and traditional culture. The main \ntechnical report will be based on research to prepare three sub-reports: (i) detailed analysis of \ndemand for childcare services based on research in urban and rural areas, by region and \nhousehold income, to put forward policy recommendations for optimizing the distribution of \nchildcare places; (ii) comparison of international practices in childcare services and financing, \nsummarizing  experiences  and  studying  different  family  welfare  and  support  policies;  and \n(iii) research to design innovative financing mechanisms to support the expansion of affordable \nchildcare services. The research should also consider the human capital impacts of expanded \naccess to quality childcare (and how to improve quality) in areas such as nutrition and cognitive \nstimulation. Output 1 will include theoretical research and literature review as well as field visits \nand primary data collection. \n \n11.  Output 2: Institutional capacity for service delivery strengthened. Output 2 will \ninclude a series of workshops, seminars, and knowledge products based on the research under \noutput 1 on policy framework design, demand analysis, international comparison, and innovative \nfinancing. Inception, midterm, and final review meetings will support high-quality policy research. \nThe TA will develop capacity among policy makers and through training of stakeholders from \nthe government agencies and social forces involved in the delivery of childcare services (based \non stakeholder analysis). Training materials will include national and international case studies. \nNational case studies may include municipalities such as Beijing and Shanghai, and prefecture-\nlevel cities such as Nanchang, Shenzhen, Suzhou, and Xi\u2019an. The final selection will consider \ngeographic  distribution  and  cities\u2019  development  stages  to  avoid  one-size-fits-all  policies. \nInternational  case  studies  most  relevant  to  the  Chinese  context  will  be  determined  in \ncollaboration  with  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC).  The  TA \nconsultants will develop a detailed capacity development and knowledge dissemination plan \nduring the inception phase. \n \n19 ADB. 2021.
