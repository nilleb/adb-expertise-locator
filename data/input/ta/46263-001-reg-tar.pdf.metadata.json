INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Transport  and  Trade \nFacilitation Strategy (the strategy)\u2014developed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical \nassistance (TA)1 and endorsed by CAREC countries in 20072\u2014aims to support CAREC\u2019s goal \nof development through cooperation by upgrading, through construction and rehabilitation, key \ncorridors  across  the  region  and  simplifying  and  harmonizing  the  regulations  that  govern  \ncross-border trade in the region. The strategy entails a time-bound implementation action plan \nthat was endorsed by CAREC countries in 2008.3 The action plan specifies the key results, \nprioritizes investments and TA projects, and provides measurable performance indicators. \n \n2.  The strategy stipulates a midterm review to be conducted during 2013\u20132014 to optimize \nits implementation in the remaining period. The new 10-year (2011\u20132020) strategic framework \nfor CAREC (CAREC 2020), which was endorsed by CAREC countries in November 2011, also \ncalls for a midterm review of the strategy and implementation action plan. In addition, the mid-\nterm review of the strategy and implementation action plan is needed to specify the CAREC \ncorridors for the two new participating countries: Pakistan and Turkmenistan. At the 11th CAREC \nTransport Sector Coordinating Committee Meeting held in June 2012 in Manila, Philippines, the \nCAREC governments concurred to the proposed TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, cost, financing \nand  implementation  arrangements,  and  consultant\u2019s  terms  of  reference.4 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The strategy and implementation action plan focus on (i) about 24,000 kilometers (km) of \nroads,5 20,000 km of railways, and 28 border crossing points along CAREC corridors; (ii) three \nports (Aktau in Kazakhstan, Turkmenbashi in Turkmenistan, and Baku in Azerbaijan) and a \nshipping route (400 km between Aktau and Baku); and (iii) 41 airports with international air \nservice. The strategy specifies the key results to be achieved on (i) about 75% of the CAREC \ncorridors improved by 2012 and 100% by 2017, compared with 64% in 2007; (ii) increased \ntransit trade volume via CAREC corridors to 2% of trade between Europe and East Asia by \n2012 and 5% by 2017, from less than 1% (about 34 million tons) in 2005; (iii) increased intra-\nregional trade volume by 25% by 2012 and by 50% by 2017, from the 2005 level (about 32 \nmillion tons); (iv) reduced time for border crossing along CAREC corridors by 50% by 2012 and \nby an additional 30% by 2017, compared with 2007; and (v) effective functioning of the national \njoint transport and trade facilitation committee or a similar organization in each CAREC country \nfor managing the CAREC corridors by 2012. \n \n4.  The strategy is now halfway through its implementation period, with progress having \nbeen made in constructing and rehabilitating transport infrastructure along the corridors. As of \nend-2011, the cumulative total of the highways built stood at 3,512 km; this means that 79% of \nthe total length of CAREC corridors is in good conditions. This exceeds the 2011 target of \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation: Transport Sector Strategy \nStudy. Manila (TA 6347-REG, approved on 12 October, for $950,000). \n2  Joint Ministerial Statement of the Sixth Ministerial Conference on Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation. \nDushanbe, Tajikistan. 2\u20133 November 2007. \n3  Joint Ministerial Statement of the Seventh Ministerial Conference on Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation. \nBaku, Azerbaijan. 19\u201321 November 2008. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 July 2012. \n5  64% of the CAREC road corridors are in good condition, 21% fair, and 15% bad. Investments focus on the fair and \nbad road sections. \n ", "2 \n \n71.5%.6 Meanwhile, cross-border transit agreements and the modernization of border crossing \nfacilities  have  contributed  to  trade  increases  within  CAREC  and  with  neighboring  regions.  \nThese  achievements,  together  with  significant  global  and  regional  trade  developments  \n(see  paragraph  5),  have  implications  on  the  strategy  and  implementation  action  plan. \nAccordingly, there will be a need to review the progress of the strategy and implementation \naction  plan  during  2013\u20132014  to  ensure  that  it  remains  relevant  and  effective  during  the \nremaining implementation period. \n \n5.  The review of the strategy and implementation action plan will be conducted amid three \nmajor global and regional developments: (i) globalization has resulted in profound changes in \nglobal production structures and supply chains, (ii) all CAREC countries have achieved differing \ndegrees of economic growth since 2007, and (iii) Pakistan and Turkmenistan joined the CAREC \nProgram in November 2010. These developments are posing three challenges to the strategy \nand implementation action plan: (i) globalization is likely to  alter supply chains in CAREC \ncountries,  affecting their  trade and traffic flows  and  increasing the  importance  of  logistics;  \n(ii) participation of Pakistan and Turkmenistan in CAREC necessitates an expansion of the \nregional transport network to increase the competitiveness of CAREC countries in response to \nnew global and regional supply chains; and (iii) sustained regional transport cooperation among \nCAREC countries depends on other regional cooperation programs (e.g., the Trans-European \nnetworks of the European Union and the Greater Mekong Subregion) and on fair distribution of \ncosts and benefits of the regional transport network in CAREC countries. The TA will address \nthese challenges by (i) refining the strategy and implementation action plan in the context of \nmajor  global  and  regional  developments;  (ii)  specifying  the  corridors  in  Pakistan  and \nTurkmenistan; and (iii) recommending realignment of the existing CAREC corridors, if needed. \nSpecifically, the review of the strategy and implementation action plan will focus on the issues \ndescribed in paragraphs 6\u201311. \n \n6.  Connectivity. Improvement of the existing six CAREC corridors has yet to be completed, \nand changes in the supply chain have resulted in new traffic patterns and possible new corridors \nfor  connectivity.  Moreover,  the  participation  of  Pakistan  and  Turkmenistan  in  CAREC  in \nNovember 2010 highlights the need to strengthen connectivity between these two countries and \nother CAREC countries. The TA will take these factors into account to assess the effectiveness \nof the CAREC corridors and identify new corridors. It will also identify the major corridors in \nPakistan and Turkmenistan that connect to neighboring CAREC countries, South Asia, and \nother regions. Using trade and traffic forecasts, the TA will identify optimal regional transport \ncorridors and propose ways to develop and realign those corridors. \n \n7.  Cross-border  movement.  Cross-border  facilitation  has  become  an  integral  part  of \ntransport cooperation under CAREC, requiring cooperative efforts from all agencies working at \nborders,  including  immigration  control,  customs,  and  inspection  and  quarantine  agencies. \nTogether with international development partners (e.g., the United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  the  World  Customs  Organization,  the  World  Trade \nOrganization), ADB has supported the efforts of CAREC countries to improve border facilities, \nstrengthen border officers\u2019 capacities, and develop cross-border agreements. A cross-border \ntransport agreement was signed by the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan in December 2010, and \nwas ratified by Tajikistan in March 2011 and the Kyrgyz Republic in June 2011. Afghanistan has \nalso expressed its intention to accede to the cross-border transport agreement. Despite these \nefforts,  cross-border  movements  among  CAREC  countries  remain  inefficient  due  to  \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2012. Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program: Development Effectiveness Review 2011. \nManila. \n ", "3 \n \nnon-harmonized policies and procedures, as well as inadequate border facilities. The TA will \nexamine these cross-border obstacles and formulate the actions to eliminate them. \n \n8.  Integrated multimodal transport system. The CAREC transport network comprises \nrailways,  roads,  civil  aviation,  and  waterways.  An  integrated  multimodal  regional  transport \nsystem is essential to reduce transport costs and foster trade, investment, and other economic \nactivities. Despite some progress, an integrated multimodal transport system has yet to be fully \noperational in CAREC countries. The TA will adopt an integrated multimodal transport approach \nby assessing multimodal transport infrastructure, harmonizing regulations and procedures set \nby  modal  agencies,  and  tackling  multimodal  logistic  issues  through cooperation  among  all \ntransport modal agencies. \n \n9.  Road  maintenance.  Road  maintenance  remains  a  daunting  challenge  in  CAREC \ncountries  because  of  growing  vehicle  axle  overloading,  weak  enforcement  of  regulations, \ninadequate funding, and ineffective management and practices. These factors threaten the \nimproved sections of the CAREC corridors, reducing their economic and social benefits and \ncausing concern about road safety. The TA will assess the current road maintenance status of \nCAREC corridors and propose ways for improvement. \n \n10.  Road safety. Road safety has become a global issue as nearly 1.3 million people are \nkilled and as many as 50 million are injured or disabled each year due to road crashes.  \nThe CAREC countries are no exception; road accidents on CAREC corridors have increased \nsince 2007. The major causes of the problem include the rapid growth in motorized vehicles, \ninadequate road safety features on road corridors, weak enforcement of traffic regulations, \ninsufficient training of drivers, and limited public awareness. Lack of coordination on road safety \namong various relevant government agencies also contributes to the problem. The growing \nnumber of road accidents result in significant human and economic losses, and have a poverty \nimpact as many victims\u2019 families suffer decreased income and become vulnerable. The TA will \nassess  the  road  safety  situation  on  CAREC  corridors  and  identify  effective  road  safety \nimprovement measures for implementation. \n \n11.  Environment  and  social  safeguards.  Development  of  CAREC  corridors  through \nconstruction and rehabilitation is associated with several environmental and social safeguard \nissues.  The  major  environmental  and  social  issues  involved  include  pollution,  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS and infectious diseases, and human and drug trafficking. These issues need to be \ntackled to ensure the sustainability of the CAREC\u2019s regional transport network. The TA will \nassess these environmental and social issues and propose measurers to mitigate and minimize \ntheir impacts. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA will contribute to expanded trade among CAREC countries and between CAREC \ncountries and the rest of the world. The outcome of the TA will be the endorsement and \nadoption of the updated CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy by CAREC countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will conduct a comprehensive  \nstock-take analysis of the implementation progress of the strategy and implementation action \n ", "4 \n \nplan. The stock-take will assess progress on (i) regional transport networks, infrastructure, and \nservices;  (ii)  major  cross-border  facilities  and  arrangements;  (iii)  policies,  legislation,  and \nregulations relating to regional transport; (iv) transport financing and financial management \ncapacity; (v) institutional and human resource capacity in the transport sector; (vi) public\u2013private \npartnerships in regional transport. The stock-take will also ascertain the demand for regional \nand transit transport and shares of transport modes. Based on the outcome of phase 1, the \nstrategy and implementation action plan will be updated in phase 2, which should (i) identify \nways to respond to the long-term challenges for CAREC regional transport cooperation and \ndevelopment, including the impact of new global supply chains and production structures on \nCAREC regional trade and traffic flows; (ii) forecast demand for regional and transit trade and \ntransport; (iii) set strategic priorities for regional transport development through cooperation for \n2013\u20132017, including safety and maintenance strategies; (iv) identify major regional transport \ncorridors based on trade flow analysis; (v) specify the role of each transport mode in the \nregional transport network; (vi) identify further transport policy and institutional reforms needed \nto  promote  regional  traffic;  (vii)  propose  methods  to  facilitate  the  harmonization  of  trade \nfacilitation  policies  in  CAREC  countries;  (viii)  propose  measures  to  enhance  public\u2013private \npartnerships for regional transport development; (ix) propose a capacity building framework;  \n(x) develop an action plan for implementation; (xi) consider CAREC 2020 and the experience of \nother, more advanced regional initiatives (e.g., the trans-European networks of the European \nUnion and the Greater Mekong Subregion); (xii) produce updated CAREC corridors that include \nPakistan and Turkmenistan, following the five criteria specified in the strategy; and (xiii) identify \nnew priority projects and specify the resources required for implementing these projects. \n \n14.  The  TA  was  designed  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  and  endorsed  at  the  \n10th CAREC Transport Sector Coordinating Committee Meeting held in Astana, Kazakhstan in \nOctober 2011, and at the 10th Ministerial Conference on CAREC held in Baku, Azerbaijan in \nNovember 2011; comments made at these meetings were incorporated into the TA design. \nDuring  TA  implementation,  stakeholder  consultation  will  continue  through  country-based \nmeetings to discuss the draft report on the stock-take of the implementation progress of the \nstrategy and implementation action plan, and the draft of the updated and refined strategy and \nimplementation action plan. \n \n15.  Key TA activities will include (i) desk studies of existing documents, studies, and reports; \n(ii) data analysis; (iii) field surveys; and (iv) stakeholder consultations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 equivalent, to be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency,  with  its  Central  and  West  Asia  Department \nimplementing the TA. The TA will be implemented over 12 months from November 2012, when \nthe  procurement  of  the  consulting  firm  is  expected  to  be  finalized,  to  November  2013.  \nThe TA will be implemented in collaboration with ADB\u2019s other relevant departments and resident \nmissions in CAREC countries, development partners involved in the CAREC program, and \nrelevant government agencies in CAREC countries. \n \n ", "5 \n \n18.
