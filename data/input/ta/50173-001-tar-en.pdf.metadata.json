INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Myanmar  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support capacity building to strengthen the business climate. The \nTA is included in the ADB country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Myanmar,1 and is \naligned  with  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132021  for  Myanmar, 2  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s economic policy.3 ADB fielded a fact-finding mission on 30 January\u20133 February \n2017 and consulted the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MOPF) and development partners in \npreparing this TA. The government confirmed the scope, implementation arrangements, financing, \nand terms of reference for consultants.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Myanmar was formerly the region\u2019s most advanced economy, but decades of economic \nisolation have resulted in high poverty and underinvestment. In 2015, Myanmar\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct per capita was just $1,193, making it one of the poorest countries in the region. Despite \nrecent strong economic performance, growth has not been inclusive, and income inequality has \nworsened. Recognizing that greater private sector participation in the economy will accelerate \ninvestment, increase productivity, and generate inclusive growth, the government has targeted \nprivate sector development as a main development objective. \n \n3.  The  government  faces  significant  challenges  in  meeting  this  objective,  however. \nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business ranking, Myanmar is currently ranked 170th \nout of 189 countries.5 The main obstacles for business have been identified as limited access to \ninputs, including credit, land, electricity, and skilled labor. In addition, when facing investment \ndecisions, firms often have difficulties interacting with the government in areas of taxation, \nregulations,  and  the  crosscutting  issue  of  corruption.  To  address  these  constraints,  the \ngovernment has completed several key reforms, including revision of the National Land Use \nPolicy, and adoption of national master plans to improve the energy and education sectors. In \naddition, two new important business laws\u2014the Company Law and the Investment Law\u2014are \nexpected to come into force in 2017; these will significantly improve the business environment by \nstreamlining business processes, promoting investment, and enhancing transparency. However, \nmore needs to be done, especially to encourage initial business participation, streamline the \ninvestment approval process, and provide businesses with better access to finance. \n \n4.  Weak  tax  administration  deters  business  entry.  A  modern,  transparent,  and \npredictable tax administration is a key component of an enabling business environment. In \ncontrast, Myanmar\u2019s tax system is outdated, complicated, and lacks transparency.6 Under the \nOfficial Assessment System, the determination of tax liabilities is arbitrary, subject to negotiations, \nand often perceived by businesses as unfair. Basic tax obligations such as registration, filing, and \npayment  are  time-consuming  and  cumbersome,  encouraging  many  smaller  businesses  to \noperate informally to avoid the administrative burden. This, together with low remuneration levels \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Myanmar, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nof civil servants and the lack of effective safeguards, has resulted in incentives for corruption, \nfurther deterring formal business participation.7 \n \n5.  The  government  has  recognized  these  constraints  and  has  solicited  support  from \ndevelopment  partners  to  modernize  the  tax  system.  The  legislative  framework  is  being \nmodernized to improve fairness, and to clarify the roles and responsibilities of both taxpayers and \nthe tax authority. The most notable reform is the introduction of the Self-Assessment System, \nwhich is being piloted by the Large Taxpayer Office; the office has operated since 2014 and \nachieved a 95% on-time filing rate in its first income tax filing cycle. However, the Internal Revenue \nDepartment (IRD) still faces significant challenges, as growth of the taxpayer registration base is \noutpacing IRD\u2019s capacity. IRD also lacks the capacity to analyze the large amount of tax data \ncollected, further restricting the government\u2019s ability to make fact-based management decisions. \nFinally, the internal audit function of IRD will need to be strengthened to ensure accountability \nand eliminate corruption.  \n \n6.  Bottleneck in the investment approval process. Myanmar is an attractive destination \nfor foreign investment, and foreign direct investment reached $9.4 billion in FY2015, following \nopening of the economy in 2012. However, Myanmar\u2019s annual inflows are only slightly higher than \nthose of Cambodia, despite Myanmar\u2019s more abundant natural resources. Several issues have \nbeen identified with respect to the investment climate, but the process for obtaining approvals for \ninward investments in particular is highly cumbersome and time consuming, increasing the cost \nof investment. All companies applying for investment in a restricted sector must obtain approval \nfrom the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC).8 Despite the influx of investment proposals, \nonly a few investment projects are approved at each MIC meeting, resulting in a large backlog of \ninvestment proposals awaiting approval. \n \n7.  The new Myanmar Investment Law amalgamates the 2012 Foreign Investment Law and \nthe Myanmar Citizens Investment Law, and gives equal treatment to foreign and domestic \ninvestors. The new law allows MIC to open regional branches and delegate some decision-\nmaking power\u2014regarding investment proposals of up to $5 million\u2014to regional governments. \nInternational  experience  suggests  that  decentralization  should  be  accompanied  by  good \ncoordination among different agencies, as well as sufficient regional-level capacity building. As \nsuch, the government will need to carefully implement the new law to ensure competition among \nregional governments to attract investment does not result in degradation of the approval process.  \n \n8.  Businesses face difficulties in accessing credit. Myanmar is currently ranked last out \nof 140 countries in the ease of access to loans for businesses.9 On the demand side, businesses \noften face complex loan procedures, unfavorable interest rates, strict collateral requirements, and \nrestricted loan maturities; they cite these as factors that constrain them from borrowing from the \nformal banking sector. On the supply side, strict regulations and the use of administrative tools \nby the central bank have resulted in high transaction costs for financial institutions. Efforts have \nbeen made to address some of these constraints, including the proposed new secured transaction \nlaw, the establishment of a credit bureau, and capacity development for commercial banks in \ncredit  and  risk  assessment.  Development  partners,  including  ADB,  are  engaging  in  policy \ndialogue with the government to gradually liberalize the market while ensuring market stability. \n \n                                                \n7  In 2016, Myanmar ranks 136th out of 176 countries in the Corruption Perception Index.  \nhttp://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 (Accessed 8 May 2017). \n8  MIC, which is chaired by the finance minister, is the government-appointed body under MOPF. \n9 World  Economic  Fume.  Global  Competitiveness  Report  2015-2016.  http://www3.weforum.org/docs/gcr/2015-\n2016/Global_Competitiveness_Report_2015-2016.pdf (Accessed 8 May 2017). \n ", "  3 \n9.  The microfinance sector can play a significant role in intermediating credit to the business \nsector in developing countries with embryonic finance sectors. Most businesses in Myanmar are \neither informal or micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), and it is likely that the \nmicrofinance sector has filled the role traditionally left to banks, as they are subject to less-\nstringent regulations.10 In addition, recent regulatory changes have given microfinance institutions \ngreater flexibility in offering loans and accepting deposits and will enable microfinance institutions \nto offer more credit to the business sector, especially MSMEs. Supporting the microfinance sector \nwill provide much-needed credit to the private sector, and provide a catalyst to rationalize banking \nregulations in the near future. \n \n10.  Having recognized these constraints, the government has recently announced the new \nEconomic Policy of the Union of Myanmar (footnote 3). This TA is aligned with the government\u2019s \nnew economic policy, and will support the government to achieve the objective of creating an \nenabling business environment to promote the overall participation of the private sector. \n \n11.  ADB experience. This TA builds on a number of previous ADB engagements, starting \nwith support for public financial management reforms by improving revenue mobilization,11 and \nstrengthening the public debt management function of MOPF.12 The TA will provide support to \nstrengthen the business regulatory and legislative environment, complementing earlier ADB \nengagements that supported reform of the 1914 Company Law, 13 and reform of the Insolvency \nLaw.14 The TA will continue work under ADB\u2019s TA for the Financial Sector Reforms, which initiated \nADB\u2019s engagement in the microfinance sector.15 Finally, regional TA is providing parallel support \nto promote private sector development in the Greater Mekong Subregion.16 \n \n12.  Donor  coordination  and  lessons  learned.  The  TA  will  support  the  government\u2019s \nongoing tax reforms, in coordination with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and \nthe United States Treasury Office of Technical Assistance.17 While there is strong development \npartner involvement in tax reform, the government\u2019s TA needs span many areas, some of which \nhave not yet been addressed by development partners. Past experience shows that a strong \ngovernment commitment to reforms and good coordination among development partners are keys \nto successful engagement. Given past ADB experience in the sector and close coordination with \nother development partners, tax reform represents a strategic area of support that can be \nexpanded over time. Support for the microfinance sector has been coordinated with development \npartners active in the finance sector,18 and will serve as an anchor for future engagement in \nfinance sector development and inclusion in Myanmar. \n                                                \n10 Microfinance institutions are subject to a 30% interest rate cap on loans, compared with 13% for banks, and \nmicrofinance institutions are allowed to lend to customers without requiring land as collateral. \n11 ADB. 2012.

The World Bank funds a resident audit advisor \nand supports an information and communication technology system. The International Monetary Fund has a resident \ntax advisor providing strategic guidance on the reform program.  \n18 The United Nations Capital Development Fund has supported the government with a financial inclusion road map \nand action plan. The World Bank\u2019s Financial Inclusion for National Development Program focuses on three areas: \ninstitution building for microfinance supervision, capacity building for regulators, and financial literacy. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: private sector growth in line with a market \neconomy system enabled (footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: an improved \nbusiness environment improved.19  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n14.  Output  1:  Tax  administration  strengthened.  In  close  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment partners, the TA will provide support to modernize specific tax administration \nfunctions as part of the government\u2019s tax reform efforts. In particular, the TA will contribute to \nenhanced integrity of tax administration, and support IRD to adopt a fact-based decision making \nprocess. An internal audit expert with a taxation background will be recruited to advise IRD on \nhow to strengthen the newly established Internal Audit Division, and a tax data expert will be hired \nto train IRD staff on tax data analysis. \n \n15.  Output  2:  Investment  approval  process  rationalized.  The  TA  will  support  the \ngovernment to implement the new Investment Law, particularly decentralization of the investment \napproval process to regional MICs. In particular, the TA will hire a consulting firm to provide a \nstudy detailing international experience in investment approval decentralization. The study will \nalso provide a needs assessment of the central and regional MICs, and produce a strategic action \nplan to rationalize and decentralize the investment approval process. The TA will also support \nimplementation of the action plan and capacity building for regional MIC staff to ensure investment \nproposals delegated to regional offices are handled in a consistent manner. \n \n16.  Output 3: Business access to financial services increased. This output will support \nthe government\u2019s initiatives to expand access by MSMEs to financial services. The TA will recruit \na microfinance expert to provide capacity training for staff of MOPF\u2019s Financial Regulatory \nDepartment in microfinance supervision. Focus areas include accounting, financial analysis, \ndelinquency analysis, financial products and services, and peer analysis. In addition, the TA will \nsupport the Financial Regulatory Department in revising regulations that allow for growth of \nmicrofinance institutions, and implementation of the national financial literacy strategy. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $880,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix  2. The government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the form  of office  space, \ncounterpart staff, office accommodations, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will administer the TA. The Public Financial Management, Financial Sector and Trade \nDivision of ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \nand organize training workshops. MOPF is the executing agency of the TA. \n \n \n                                                \n19 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "  5 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  August 2017\u2013July 2020 \nExecuting agency  MOPF \nImplementing agencies  Departments within MOPF: FRD, IRD, and DICAa \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nQuality- and cost-based  8 person-months  $242,376 \nselection (90:10) \nIndividual consultant selection  38 person-months  $411,836 \nProcurement  Procurement will be undertaken by consultants, and will conducted in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time). \nShopping  One contract  $10,000 \nDisbursement  TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal arrangement  Upon TA completion, all goods purchased will be turned over to the \nupon TA completion  relevant MOPF offices. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DICA = Directorate of Investment and Company Administration, FRD = Financial \nRegulatory Department, IRD = Internal Revenue Department, MOPF = Ministry of Planning and Finance, TA = technical \nassistance. \na  IRD will be accountable for output 1, DICA for output 2, and FRD for output 3.
