THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Urban \nProject Preparatory Facility. The report also describes proposed TA for Capacity Building for \nSecondary Towns and Strategic Cities, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.   \n2.  The proposed facility will strengthen project readiness and institutional capacity in the \nurban sector by (i) completing advanced feasibility studies and detailed designs for urban projects \nwith  climate  and  disaster  resilience  and  gender-friendly  features;1 (ii)  providing  advanced \nimplementation support through the preparation of bidding documents for advanced contracting, \nand safeguard documents; and (iii) strengthening the institutional capacities of implementing \nagencies during the inception period of project implementation. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector performance and key issues. Urban projects are complex and require significant \npreparation. The experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Sri Lanka shows limited \nlong-term strategic investment planning, weak engineering capacity in urban departments, and \nlengthy land acquisition processes.2 These issues lead to (i) lack of investment-grade projects \nready for appraisal, (ii) slow start-up and implementation delays, (iii) multiple scope changes, \n(iv) cost overruns, and (v) delays in the delivery of benefits to the people.3  \n \n4.  Limited strategic investment planning. Urbanization to enable agglomeration, drive \ninnovation,  promote  environmental  sustainability,  and  boost  economic  growth  in  Sri  Lanka \ninvolves strategic planning and up-front engagement. Demand to improve urban services in city \ncenters,  such  as  Colombo,  remains,  but  demand  is  growing  for  peri-urban  and  greenfield \ndevelopment to support planned urbanization in strategic economic corridors. Planning for trunk \ninfrastructure with links to satellite towns is needed to enhance city and regional competitiveness. \nIncorporating  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  high  technology,  gender  equality,  as  well  as \naddressing governance issues adds more layers to project planning.  \n \n5.  Limited institutional capacity to prepare and implement urban projects. The urban \nsector in Sri Lanka is constrained by weak implementing agencies, requiring significant hand-\nholding support, especially in detailed engineering, procurement, contract management, and \nsafeguards. Implementing agencies need increased capacities to address issues critical for \nproject planning; execution; operation and maintenance (O&M); and other areas of sustainability \nincluding revenue generation, and financial and asset management. Key institutions in the urban \nsector include the Ministry of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports (MPCLGS), the \nMinistry of Megapolis and Western Development (MMWD), the National Water Supply and \nSewerage Board, provincial councils, and local authorities. \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2018\u20132020. Manila. The \nfacility will prepare two projects listed for approval in 2020\u20132021: (i) the Secondary Towns Sustainable Development \nProject ($180 million) under the MPCLGS; and (ii) the Western Megapolis Urban Infrastructure Development Project \n($200 million) under the strategic cities development program of the MMWD. \n2  Land acquisition in Sri Lanka takes up to 1.5 years to complete. \n3  This is accentuated when projects are dispersed across the country and partially managed by municipal entities. \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Value addition of ADB. The following are key lessons from ADB\u2019s sector and country \nexperience incorporated in the facility design: (i) developing high project readiness for immediate \nstart-up and timely delivery of benefits,4 (ii) building the implementation capacity of project \nagencies,  (iii) commencing  land  acquisition  during  the  planning  stage  of  projects, \n(iv) incorporating disaster and climate resilience into project designs, (v) achieving more equitable \noutcomes  by  mainstreaming  gender,  and  (vi) demonstrating  smart  urban  solutions  through \ninnovative pilot projects. The proposed facility will go beyond traditional water and sanitation \nprojects to support other key infrastructure and services for enhancing urban livability and \neconomic growth. These include (i) introducing intelligent transportation systems (considering \ndisability access) for traffic management and road safety; (ii) creating high-quality public spaces; \n(iii) promoting digital technologies (e.g., mobile bill payment systems, remote early warning \nsystems), and energy-efficient urban services (e.g., solar lighting, green public buildings) to \nreduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  improve  operational  efficiency;  and  (iv)  supporting \ninfrastructure for tourism and markets for enhanced local and regional competitiveness.5 \n \n7.  Urbanization challenges. While 20% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population lives in urban areas, cities \ncontribute  more  than  an  estimated  40%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).   As  Sri  Lanka \napproaches upper middle-income status, a number of development challenges continue to \nconstrain its growth potential, including (i) unplanned urbanization; (ii) inequitable access to basic \nurban services outside of Colombo; (iii) urban environmental pollution; (iv) weak local governance \nand institutional capacities; (v) low service level indicators;6 (vi) vulnerability to climate change \nand disasters including floods, landslides, and droughts; and (vii) weak disaster risk management \ncapabilities. \n \n8.  Government strategy. In its Vision 2025 and Public Investment Program (2016\u20132018), \nthe  government  articulates  its  goals  and  strategy  for  stimulating  inclusive  and  balanced \ngeographic development for achieving upper middle-income status.7 The vision focuses on \nimproving access to and delivery of urban services, such as roads, markets, public spaces, \ndrainage, solid waste management, traffic management, and e-governance. Through its Strategic \nCities Development Program, overseen by the MMWD and supported by development partners,8 \nthe government aims to improve urban services in six city regions (Anuradhapura, Galle, Jaffna, \nKurunegala, Kandy, and Trincomalee).9 Through these programs, the government prioritizes full \ncoverage of urban services, especially in underserved urban areas, as well as strengthening the \ncapacity  of  local  institutions  for  improved  service  delivery.  It  also  identifies  disaster  risk \nmanagement and climate change resilience as priorities.10 The government requested ADB to \nsupport advanced project readiness of urban projects and to strengthen institutional capacity in \n                                                \n4  Advance recruitment of consultants is a good practice from ADB projects.

The facility is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 and \nis aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022.11 \n \n9.  Economic corridors and strategic cities. To facilitate balanced economic development \nand growth beyond the Western Province, ADB supported the preparation of a study to develop \na comprehensive plan for the Colombo\u2013Trincomalee Economic Corridor (CTEC).12 A multisector \napproach is adopted by integrating industry, infrastructure, logistics, and urbanization within the \ncorridor. The CTEC connects urban clusters with industrial areas. Among the cities to be \nsupported under the facility, three strategic cities (Dambulla, Kurunegala, and Trincomalee) are \nlocated within the CTEC, and included in the ensuing MMWD project (footnote 1). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: urban projects in strategic cities and towns \nimplemented in a timely manner (footnote 7). The project will have the following outcome: high \nlevel of urban project readiness achieved.13 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Feasibility studies and detailed designs of urban subprojects completed. \nThis will include subprojects in up to 29 cities (four strategic cities under the MMWD and \n25 secondary towns under the MPCLGS) with climate and disaster-resilience and gender-friendly \nfeatures completed. Subprojects will comply with agreed selection criteria outlined in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).14 \n \n12.  Output 2: Advance implementation support for two ensuing projects provided.  The \nsupport for the two projects (footnote 1) will include (i) at least 30% of bidding documents for civil \nworks contracts prepared and tendered before ADB loan fact finding mission for ensuing projects, \n(ii) safeguard documents prepared and disclosed for the 30% bidding documents, and (iii) gender \naction plans prepared before ADB loan fact finding mission for the two ensuing projects. \n  \n13.

There is no climate financing under the facility. Follow-on urban projects (footnote 1) will \ninclude costs and financing to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 14). The two executing agencies, the MPCLGS and the MMWD, will establish \nseparate PMUs for implementation. The PMUs will recruit consulting firms to prepare feasibility \n ", "5 \nstudies, engineering designs, bidding documents, safeguard documents, and gender action \nplans. Recruitment will be through quality- and cost-based (90:10) selection. Full technical \nproposals  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  consulting firms.  Procurement  (including  consulting \nservices) to be financed by the loan will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). \n  \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2018\u2013September 2021 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2021 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 March 2022 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  National steering committees will be established for both executing \nagencies, chaired by the secretaries of the Ministry of Provincial \nCouncils, Local Government and Sports (MPCLGS) and the \nMinistry of Megapolis and Western Development (MMWD). An \ninterministerial committee, chaired by the secretaries of the \nMPCLGS and MMWD, will meet periodically to review overall \nfacility progress. \n \nChair: Secretaries, MPCLGS and MMWD \n \nMembers: Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs \n(National Planning Department, External Resources Department); \nMinistry of Finance and Mass Media; Ministry of City Planning and \nWater Supply; National Budget Department; Department of Project \nManagement and Monitoring; Urban Development Authority; and \nprovincial councils.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  The TA for Capacity Building for Secondary Towns and Strategic Cities attached to the \nfacility will support output 3 in the following areas: (i) strengthen the institutional capacity of project \nagencies  to  design  and  manage  urban  infrastructure  projects,  particularly  in  procurement, \nsafeguards,  financial  management,  gender  mainstreaming,  climate  and  disaster  resilience, \nfinancial  management,  project  performance  monitoring,  and  innovative  approaches;  and \n(ii) strengthen the institutional capacity to design and implement urban governance improvement \nprograms,  including  innovative  areas  of  revenue  generation,  financial  management,  citizen \nparticipation, gender mainstreaming, e-governance, O&M, asset management, and strategic \nplanning.16 The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, venue and support staff for training, and other \nin-kind contributions. The value of government contribution is estimated to account for 10% of the \ntotal TA cost. The TA will be implemented from September 2018 to September 2021. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The urban sector investments to be prepared under the facility will be in line with (i) the \ngovernment\u2019s national strategy and sector development plans, and (ii) ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Sri Lanka. An initial list of priority projects for the TA loan was identified in line with \nthe selection criteria, and others will be identified in consultation with the government following \nthe same criteria.17 The terms of reference prepared for the consulting services cover technical \naspects, including detailed feasibility studies, engineering design, alternatives analysis (technical, \nenvironmental,  social),  life  cycle  costs,  energy  efficiency,  and  climate-resilient  measures; \nmaximizing beneficiary area coverage, including the poor and poor households headed by \nwomen; minimizing adverse environmental and social impacts; and optimizing timelines for high \nproject readiness of ensuing investment projects. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The ensuing urban investment projects to be prepared under the facility will support \nSri Lanka\u2019s overall economic growth and poverty reduction by enhancing urban service delivery \nin priority economic hubs and corridors to reduce the costs to markets and enhancing the quality \nof life in communities with broad economic and social activities. The facility will support the \ngovernment in preparing feasibility studies and detailed designs and will assist the executing \nand/or implementing agencies in procurement and safeguard advance actions. The attached TA \nwill strengthen towns and cities in good governance, including revenue generation and financial \nmanagement, to enhance capital expenditures, O&M, asset management, and services delivery. \nIt will bridge the gap between project preparation and implementation; minimize the delays \nnormally observed between preparing feasibility studies and detailed designs, procurement \nactivities,  and  commencement  of  actual  works;  and  reduce  financial  charges,  such  as \ncommitment and interest fees, under the ensuing projects. \n \n23.  The terms of reference for consulting services include carrying out economic and financial \nassessments for ensuing projects in accordance with the related policies and guidelines of the \n                                                \n16 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 The initial list of priority projects and selection criteria are outlined in the PAM (footnote 14). \n ", "7 \ngovernment and ADB. These assessments will help formulate economically and financially viable \nurban projects. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Financial management. The financial management risk is moderate mainly because \nMMWD and MPCLGS have sufficient experience in implementing externally funded projects.18 \nThey have established legal, institutional, and monitoring frameworks for budgeting, accounting, \nand auditing. The project design includes the following risk mitigation measures: (i) extending full \ntraining and capacity building support for enhancing the financial management capacity of the \nMMWD PMU, (ii) the commitment of the MMWD and MPCLGS to the timely allocation and \ndisbursement of the government\u2019s counterpart funds, (iii) providing adequate support by hiring \nthe project design and procurement consultants for enhancing the procurement capacity of the \nPMUs, and (iv) strengthening the internal audit process of the PMUs by appointing qualified staff \nor outsourcing to experienced audit firms.  \n \n25.  Procurement.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall \nprocurement  risk  for  the  project  is  moderate.  The  MPCLGS  and  MMWD  have  extensive \nexperience in development partner supported procurement, including ADB in the case of the \nMPCLGS. The recruitment of consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers. A procurement expert recruited under the attached TA will \nprovide additional implementation support for the MMWD. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the MPCLGS and MMWD. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The facility is not expected to have any impact on poverty, while follow-on urban projects \nwill be prepared to improve urban services benefiting the poor. \n \n27.  Gender. The facility is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Gender design features \ninclude (i) projects with gender-friendly features designed, (ii) guidelines for mainstreaming \ngender in the design of urban projects prepared and disseminated, (iii) gender action plans \n(GAPs) prepared before the loan fact-finding mission for the ensuing investment projects, and \n(iv) training on gender mainstreaming for PMU and other relevant agency staff provided. A GAP \nhas been prepared with clear targets, responsibilities, and resource allocation for the meaningful \nparticipation of women.19 The MPCLGS and MMWD will implement the GAP with support from \nconsultants recruited under the facility. The PMU social officers will serve as the gender focal \npoints to oversee GAP implementation. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the facility\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:20 \n \n                                                \n18 The MPCLGS is implementing the ongoing ADB. 2016.
