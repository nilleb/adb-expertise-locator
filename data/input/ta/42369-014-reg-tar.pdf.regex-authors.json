INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific, prepared by the Economics and Research \nDepartment, is one of the annual flagship publications of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe  publication  provides  the  latest  comprehensive  compendium  and  analysis  of  trends  of \neconomic,  social,  financial,  and  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  indicators  of  ADB\u2019s \nregional members. It also contains a special chapter that provides in-depth, data-intensive \npolicy analysis of a prevailing critical policy issue. In general, Key Indicators provides a strong \ndata and information support system for evidence-based policy making.  \n \n2.  To ensure that the Key Indicators series effectively promotes ADB\u2019s reputation as a \nknowledge institution and serves as a powerful instrument for better informed policies and \nprojects, it is essential that rigorous research on the topic selected for the special chapter of Key \nIndicators is conducted along with intensive data validation, analysis, and compilation.1 The \nprocess will involve extensive collaboration with statistical and other partners, and use of a \nwidespread  and  multipronged  approach  in  disseminating  the  resulting  publications.  This \ntechnical assistance (TA) will ensure that these activities are carried out effectively. The TA\u2019s \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \n3.  To complete the shift of the Key Indicators special chapter into a 2-year production cycle \nto allow for more rigorous and systematic analysis, this TA will support the preparation of both \nKey Indicators 2013 and Key Indicators 2014, i.e., the 44th and 45th editions of Key Indicators. \nThis is possible since much of the background work for the Key Indicators 2013 special chapter \nis based on staff contributions and financing from the research and development TA, Key \nIndicators for Asia and the Pacific 2012.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Research on the structural transformation in Asia and the Pacific and its relationship with \nother key challenges in different sectors and aspects is very important given the different levels \nof development progress in the region. The research findings will help in understanding the \nunderlying issues, and therefore be useful in designing better policies to manage structural \ntransformation that can lead to more inclusive growth and rapid poverty reduction in Asia and \nthe Pacific. Background research papers are needed to explore topics related to structural \ntransformation, such as the impact of diversification and specialization on economic growth and \nwage levels; the impact of structural transformation on education, energy, and infrastructure \nneeds; and key drivers of structural transformation and their policy implications. Higher-income \nAsian  economies  such  as  Hong  Kong,  China;  Japan;  Singapore;  Republic  of  Korea;  and \nTaipei,China have managed to achieve high and sustainable growth that has enabled them to \nmove up the income ladder from low-income to high-income economies, bypassing the middle-\nincome trap in a relatively short period of time. Many other countries have managed to climb \nfrom low- to middle-income levels but failed to maintain the growth momentum to achieve a \nhigh-income level. Furthermore, structural change in the Pacific economies presents even more \nchallenges that may be explored.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The special chapter of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2012, Green Urbanization in Asia, discussed the rapid \nurbanization taking place in Asia along with its positive benefits and related emerging challenges, including those \nfor the local and global environments. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 October 2012. \n3 ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for the Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2012. Manila. \n ", "2  \n5.  As Key Indicators is a premier knowledge product of ADB, its quality must be maintained \nand its contents must be continuously improved. In addition to the special chapter, the latest \nKey Indicators edition contained more than 120 statistical tables of indicators grouped according \nto MDGs; people; economy and output; money, finance, and prices; globalization; transport, \nelectricity, and communications; energy and environment; and government and governance.4 A \nshort, nontechnical commentary of selected indicators precedes each of the groups. A review of \nthe statistical tables will be carried out early to determine whether new indicators need to be \nadded  to  ensure  that  users  are  aware  of  emerging  issues,  or  existing  indicators  are \ndiscontinued to keep the publication from becoming unwieldy. Similarly, the choice of indicators \nto be analyzed in the commentaries will be carefully considered to reflect the impact of current \ndevelopments across different themes.  \n \n6.  Key  Indicators  2013  and  Key  Indicators  2014  will  continue  to  feature  the  special \nsupplements\u2014the third and fourth editions of the Framework of Inclusive Growth Indicators \n(FIGI).  As  a  significant  contribution  towards  making  inclusive  growth  operational,  the  FIGI \nidentified 35 indicators that depict the policy aspects of inclusive growth\u2014economic growth and \nemployment opportunities, social inclusion, social protection, as well as good governance and \ninstitutions. The FIGI is gaining support within and outside ADB, especially in its efforts to go \nbeyond  gross  domestic  product  as  a  measure  of  growth  and  well-being.  The  continued \ndevelopment and dissemination of the FIGI will support ADB\u2019s thrust to promote inclusive \ngrowth.  \n \n7.  The message and data contents of Key Indicators must be effectively disseminated to its \ntarget  audience,  which  includes  policy  makers,  statistical  offices,  researchers,  academics, \njournalists,  the  private  sector,  ADB  staff,  regional  and  international  organizations,  and  the \ngeneral  public.  Key  Indicators  is  viewed  as  a  credible  and  valid  source  for  statistics  and \ndevelopment policy issues in Asia and the Pacific. Hence, in addition to research for the special \nchapter and to further support research work on the FIGI, the TA will also support expanded \ndissemination of Key Indicators 2013 and Key Indicators 2014 outputs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The main impact of Key Indicators 2013 and Key Indicators 2014 and their supplements \nwill be to influence the environment where  economic monitoring and/or policy formulation, \ninvestment decisions, and new projects based on rigorous evidence-based research findings \nand timely and reliable statistics occur, especially in ADB\u2019s developing member countries.  \n \n9.  By the end of the project, Key Indicators 2013 and Key Indicators 2014 will be referred to \nby policy makers and/or economic researchers within and outside Asia, as well as by the \ngeneral public. Improved contents and quality of Key Indicators 2013 and Key Indicators 2014 \nwill provide (i) information on trends and emerging issues that affect the development status of \ndeveloping member countries; (ii) high-quality data presented in the country, regional, and MDG \ntables; and (iii) indicators of inclusive growth for project planners, policy makers, researchers, \n                                                 \n4  The Key Indicators has four parts: Part I \u2013 the special chapter; Part II - the MDGs; Part III - the regional tables; and \nPart IV \u2013 definitions. Country tables, which are statistical tables containing socioeconomic data of developing \nmember countries, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, are available only on CD-ROM but can also be accessed \nonline. \n ", "  3\nand other users. Appendix 2 presents the outline of Key Indicators 2013 and the FIGI. Key \nIndicators 2014 will follow the same outline. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will support the following key activities of Key Indicators 2013 and Key Indicators \n2014: (i) updating, compiling, and validating data for the country, regional, and MDG tables; (ii) \npreparing background papers including data-intensive research related to the theme chapters \nand the FIGI; (iii) drafting the theme chapter, FIGI, and thematic analysis; (iv) editing, laying out, \nand printing the publications; (v) disseminating the publications; and (vi) analyzing important \npolicy issues related to emerging challenges for future special chapters of the Key Indicators \nseries.  Following  the  2-year  cycle,  initial  preparations  for  the  Key  Indicators  2015  special \nchapter may also be supported under this TA. \n \n11.  For  Key  Indicators  2013,  the  special  chapter  will  examine  the  issue  of  industry \ndiversification and upgrading product sophistication in Asia and the Pacific. For Key Indicators \n2014 the chapter will delve into greater depth on one particular aspect or underlying factor of the \nstructural transformation and diversification process, such as the role of education or impacts on \ninequality.5 The studies will also cover key topics pertinent to Asia and the Pacific, such as the \nroles of the manufacturing and service sectors as drivers of growth, the role and emerging \ntrends of international trade, and the key determinants for successful transformation from a low-\nincome to a high-income economy. Examples of related issues include industry policy and other \ngovernment regulations supporting the structural transformation process, the kind of education \nthat can prepare skilled workers for obtaining higher value-added and remunerative employment, \nthe role of cities as centers of innovation and economic activity, and energy supply and demand \nto support such economic transformation. The discussions will also involve analysis of some \nsocioeconomic factors such as health, demographics, and food and energy security and their \nimpacts on inclusive growth, inequality, and poverty as a result of the transformation. Overall, \nthe studies will provide an evidence-based perspective on what can be done to better support \neconomic development and poverty reduction efforts over a period of time and at different levels \nof development.  \n \n12.  As part of preparing Key Indicators 2013 and Key Indicators 2014, a series of workshops \nand seminars will be held, with invitees to include prominent researchers, key government \nofficials, policy makers, and other key stakeholders. Workshops and seminars are especially \ncrucial for (i) developing the special chapters, (ii) firming up the initial findings of the background \nresearch papers, and (iii) discussing constraints on and the general direction of the special \nchapters.  Background  papers  may  also  be  prepared  for  the  latest  editions  of  the  FIGI \nsupplement.  Further,  workshops  and  seminars  may  be  held  to  look  at  the  possibility  of \nharmonizing inclusiveness with development effectiveness by analyzing economies in Asia and \nthe Pacific that are making progress in reducing poverty and inequalities. Distinguished experts \nwill be invited to give their views so that the outputs of the workshops will be useful in finalizing \nthe  Key  Indicators  publications.  Research,  consultations,  and  discussions  with  staff  from \nregional  and  other  departments  within  ADB  will  also  be  conducted  to  further  validate  the \nrelevance  of  the  research  findings,  as  well  as  to  identify  emerging  concerns  that  can  be \npotential topics for future Key Indicators publications. \n                                                 \n5 The Key Indicators 2013 special chapter and the research and development TA for Policies for Industrial and \nService Diversification in Asia in the 21st Century are designed to maximize potential synergies. The special \nchapter will focus primarily on the process of structural transformation and its implications, while the TA will focus \non the role of policies in influencing that process. ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Policies for Industrial and \nService Diversification in Asia in the 21st Century. Manila. \n ", "4  \n \n13.  A series of internal meetings and workshops will also be organized to streamline the Key \nIndicators production process. Production bottlenecks to be addressed will include issues such \nas  staff  and  consultant  assignments;  overall  coordination;  development  of  commentaries; \ngeneration of country, regional, and MDG statistical tables; and consultant recruitment. System \nimprovements will also be carried out, including the interlinked processes involving the statistical \ndatabase  system.  Moreover,  the  use  of  C-cube  as  an  additional  platform  for  regular \ncommunications and data exchanges will be explored, including for sending out Key Indicators \nquestionnaires and receiving replies, and for discussion forums including on best practice and \nmethods.6 Close monitoring of the Key Indicators process will mitigate the risk of unforeseen \ncircumstances that may affect the production schedule. \n   \n14.  To improve the quality of Key Indicators, new regional aggregations may be introduced \nin the statistical tables. The aggregations are currently available but are limited to only a few \nindicators.  Compiling  aggregates  using  transparent,  consistent,  and  sound  methods  and \npractices will provide additional value to users. However, this may involve looking at different \nclassifications  and  aggregation  practices  used  in  Key  Indicators  in  the  light  of  recent \nsocioeconomic  developments  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  practices  of  other  international \norganizations, and this may raise complex issues. The TA will support the development of \nmethodologies to produce the aggregations. \n \n15.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency of approach across the different parts \nof  Key  Indicators,  the  knowledge  products  will  undergo  stringent  editing  following  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook of Style and Usage.7 Experienced international economics and/or manuscript editors \nwill help prepare the publications' special chapters, highlights, and the FIGI. Copy editors will \nedit the regional tables, country tables, FIGI tables, the definitions, and front parts of the \ndocuments.  \n \n16.   The Key Indicators publications will be widely disseminated in coordination with ADB\u2019s \nDepartment of External Relations. Dissemination will start with an international media launch \nfollowed by a seminar presentation to key government officials, business people, academe, and \nother research groups. Concurrently, the publications will be uploaded to the ADB website. To \nstimulate more discussion on the issues, outreach activities may also be conducted in selected \nmember countries. Background papers will be published separately in ADB\u2019s working paper \nseries, the Asian Development Review, or other media at a later date. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency. The Development Indicators and Policy Research \nDivision  (ERDI)  will  implement  the  project  in  coordination  with  the  regional  departments, \nresident mission offices, and statistical partners in ADB\u2019s member countries. The project will be \n                                                 \n6 C-cube is a set of tools that link members through the web environment within and outside ADB and allow them to \ncommunicate ideas and insights, coordinate tasks and events, and collaborate by sharing documents or hold \nconferences in different locations. \n7 ADB. 2011.

The Key Indicators publication is produced by a team consisting of ERDI international, \nnational, and administrative staff with support from international and national consultants. For \nKey Indicators 2013 and Key Indicators 2014 and their supplements, an estimated 16 person-\nmonths of international consultancy services and 92 person-months of national consultancy \nservices will be needed for the entire production process, i.e., for the special chapter, the \nstatistical  tables  (MDG,  country,  and  regional),  the  special  supplement,  and  other \ndevelopmental activities related to improving data quality and promoting effective dissemination \nof results and findings.  \n \n20.  Consulting services are required to develop the different parts of Key Indicators. For the \nspecial chapter, international consultants will be preparing background papers and original \nresearch material related to the theme, and will provide some manuscript and economics editing. \nNational consultants will provide specific insight and research into country case studies and \nassist in data cleaning, calculations, and some analytical research.  \n \n21.  For  the  statistical  tables\u2014MDG,  regional,  and  country\u2014and  commentaries,  an \ninternational or national consultant may be engaged to develop the aggregation procedures and \nother methodologies or innovations that will contribute to increasing the interest for users of the \npublication. An international consultant will also be recruited to draft the commentaries. Both \nstaff and national consultants will assist in preparing the statistical tables, charts, boxes, and \ncommentaries; laying out the text and tables; and copy editing. \n \n22.  For the special supplements, international consultants will work on the analysis and \nwrite-up for a theme of interest, focusing on an aspect of inclusive growth. National consultants \nwill assist in updating, validating, and further researching the indicators; laying out text and \ntables; and manuscript and/or copy editing. \n \n23.  Resource  persons  will  also  be  engaged  to  contribute  as  facilitators,  speakers,  or \npanelists for Key Indicators workshops for the special chapters, supplements, and the statistical \ntables. Travel of ADB staff participating as resource persons in related workshops, conferences, \nor seminars may also be supported, following the appropriate administrative guidelines. \n \n24.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  individually  and  selected  on  the  basis  of  their \nqualifications  for  the  assignment.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  is  in \nAppendix 4. The international and national consultants, as well as resource persons, to be \nretained will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement of goods or equipment, if any, will be \ndone in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.
