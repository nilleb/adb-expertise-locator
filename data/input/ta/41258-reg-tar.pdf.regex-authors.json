Many  developing  member  countries  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  have \nwitnessed rapid economic growth but with insufficient reduction of poverty. ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  responds  to  this  by  emphasizing  inclusive \ngrowth as necessary for realizing its vision of a region free of poverty by 2020.1   \n  \n2.  Poverty in the Asia and Pacific region is now estimated to be much larger than earlier \nreported.2 The region also faces major hurdles in meeting its Millennium Development Goals. \nThe task is far too large for the public sector to handle by itself, and so the role of the private \nsector in poverty reduction and inclusive growth is therefore critical. The base of the pyramid \n(BOP)  approach3  is  an  innovative  concept  that  channels  private  entrepreneurship  towards \ninclusive development. It argues that the private sector can play a bigger role in improving the \nlives of the poor and near poor than it does now, leaving the public sector to focus on those most \nin need. This technical assistance (TA), therefore, attempts to strengthen the participation of the \nprivate sector in the BOP market.4   \n \n3.  Fact finding for this TA was carried out in India and Indonesia and government agencies, \nprivate sector groups, representatives of the financial sector, and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  concerned  in  these  countries  have  been  consulted  in  developing  the  design  and \nimplementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The Base of the Pyramid Approach. Due to a high level of inequality, the richer groups \nin the region, although small in number, earn a disproportionately large portion of the total \nincome. Those earning above $3,000 (purchasing power parity in 2002 international dollars), \nwhile constituting only 17% of the region\u2019s population, account for 58% of its total income. The \nprivate sector generally caters to this narrow upper portion of the population. However, the BOP \nmarket is large and potentially viable. The BOP segment\u2014those earning less than $3,000 \n(purchasing power parity) a year, or less than current $2.11 per day in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and $1.56 in India\u2014is estimated at 2.8 billion people with total earnings of $3.47 trillion.5 \nAny inclusive growth strategy must involve this vast BOP market in the growth process.   \n \n5.  There are many reasons why the BOP market has failed to integrate with the growing \neconomy of Asia. The BOP population in Asia, both as consumers and producers, is mainly rural \nand lacks infrastructure, financial services, communications, electricity, and access to clean \nwater, education, and basic health services. It faces difficulties in accessing new technology, and \nits  activities  are  largely  informal  in  nature,  preventing  proper  access  to  resources.  A large \nnumber of the BOP population do not have title to their land, dwellings, or other property. 6 Most \ndo not have crucial information such as on prices, or access to markets for their labor or produce, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

They also pay a \npoverty penalty\u2014paying higher prices or receiving lower quality for goods and services.  \n \n6.  The  BOP  approach  tries  to  overcome  these  constraints  by  addressing  policy  and \ninstitutional  barriers 7   and  by  fostering  new  business  models  with  product  and  process \ninnovations in order to enable the BOP market to function more efficiently and productively on \ncommercial lines. Areas with some initial successes are commercial microfinance, commercial \nmicro health insurance,8 and mobile telephony. There has been little headway made in other \npromising areas such as private water distribution, off-grid electric supply, or provision of clean \ncooking fuel (footnote 5).   \n \n7.  In general, private enterprises (including small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs]) in \nthe formal sector have left the BOP sector relatively underserved due to perceptions of the high \nrisk involved in addressing the BOP segment.9 The approach adopted in this project is to focus \non the SME sector (including SMEs in the agriculture sector) where the potential is highest and \nthe support is most needed.10 Among factors providing an edge to SMEs are (i) suitable scale to \nviably address BOP markets, and (ii) better ability\u2014through working with NGOs and community \norganizations\u2014to organize BOP producers.11 Large enterprises inclined to tap the BOP market \ncan do so using the larger resources at their command; many have already begun doing so.12   \n8.  Policy Environment and Knowledge to Foster the Base of the Pyramid Approach. \nThe BOP approach will need strong public\u2013private partnerships initially to succeed. At present, \nknowledge about ways to develop the BOP market is insufficient and the BOP approach does \nnot figure prominently in strategies for development. While most countries are aware of the need \nto promote SMEs, more knowledge is needed about better ways to engage the private sector in \nthe BOP sector. While studies have shown the size and potential of this market globally, they \nneed to be followed up at the regional level to demonstrate BOP opportunities for the private \nsector  and  enable  countries  to  adopt  appropriate  strategies,  policies,  and  institutions  to \nencourage development in the BOP sector. Such an approach can use the intellectual capital \nand global knowledge of best practices available, as well as profit from regional best practices.  \n \n9.  Demonstrating Enterprise Potential at the Base of the Pyramid. Opportunities in the \nBOP  sector  can  be  demonstrated  if  there  exists  a  sizable  pipeline  of  enterprises  with  the \nrequired characteristics that are suitable for investment. New technologies with proven viability \nhave been developed and these can enable BOP producers to obtain better value for their \n                                                 \n7  For example, to enable easier entry, access to resources and markets, better partnering with government and civil \nsociety, removal of constraints facing informal sector participants, etc.   \n8  Such as the Yeshavani scheme in Karnataka, India.  \n9  SME lending without sufficient enterprise development is fraught with risk, and finance is not the only input needed. \nMany countries have banks with high nonperforming SME loans as a result.     \n10 The focus of ADB\u2019s considerable SME lending has not been exclusively in the BOP sector. Projects have \nemphasized development of the business environment for promoting SMEs, including capacity development for \npublic business development services, and provided lines of credit. Credit has not usually been targeted exclusively \nat the BOP segment, although there has been geographical targeting to poor regions in some cases (such as in \nsome Sri Lanka SME interventions). The criteria of subloans have been based on the size of turnover and assets \nand/or the size of loans. In the Philippines, a guarantee-cum-credit/equity operation was also carried out to support \nSME development, but it was not focused specifically on the BOP sector.        \n11\n Although the BOP approach encourages all enterprises, including microenterprises in the BOP segment, the focus \nin this regional research and development technical assistance is on SMEs, as (i) microenterprises are already \nengaged in the BOP sector, (ii) SMEs are likely to be potentially more attractive to the private sector than \nmicroenterprises, (iii) successful microenterprises have often relied on subsidized microfinance, and (iv) experience \nsuggests that provision of finance without enterprise development is unlikely to be successful, so the focus is on \nenterprise development at the scale which is more viable\u2014i.e., SMEs.  \n12 Such as Hindustan Lever and ITC Ltd. in India.   \n ", "  3\nproducts  if  they  can  be  replicated  in  the  region.  Some  starts  have  been  made  by  small \nenterprises  supporting  the  BOP  sector,  but  there  is  no  systematic  database  of  such  BOP \nenterprises or information on their experiences.  \n \n10.  For example, mini hydropower plants (less than 1 megawatt) using run of the river \ntechnology in remote off-grid areas have great potential that remains largely unexploited in the \nregion. Developing sustainable and organic agriculture to bring greater value to poor farmers is \nanother example. Similarly, cultivation of jatropha plant, which uses arid land unfit for cultivation, \ncan  provide  biofuel  and  generate  livelihoods  for  poor  farmers.  New  technologies  in  water \npurification are bringing affordable water to populations at risk. For BOP communities without \nwater distribution networks, small-scale community-based water treatment systems are available. \nNew dual-fuel stoves use clean-burning propane or biofuels, but reduce the amount of biofuels \nby  as  much  as  80%  compared  to  traditional  cooking  methods,  providing  clean  affordable \nalternatives to coal and firewood. But many of these new technologies have yet to penetrate \ndeveloping countries and may be unknown to entrepreneurs. Bringing global best practice to \nlocal businesses is one of the significant advantages of a BOP approach. \n \n11.  Entrepreneurs  seeking  to  address  the  BOP  sector  face  many  challenges,  including \ninsufficiently conducive business environments, lack of knowledge of available technologies or \nbusiness  skills,  and  difficulty  in  obtaining  finance.  Enterprise  development  activities  which \nidentify  potential  BOP  enterprises  to  help  them  develop  viable  business  models,  provide \ninformation about technologies, build business skills, and then, through a structured process, \nbring them into contact with investors, can address many such challenges. Studies reveal that \nsuccessful BOP strategies (i) focus on meeting the BOP segment\u2019s specific needs through new \napproaches; (ii) localize value creation through franchising, building local systems of vendors or \nsuppliers, or treating the community as a customer (all involving capacity-building efforts); (iii) \nenable access to goods and services by the BOP segment financially (such as single-use \npackaging), or physically through new distribution strategies; and (iv) involve unconventional \npartnering with governments, NGOs, and stakeholders (footnote 5).    \n \n12.  Financing. A major constraint facing SME financing for the BOP sector is a perception of \nhigh risk. Although private equity investors and commercial financiers interested in investing in \nSMEs exist (particularly in some of the middle- or near middle-income countries in Asia), they do \nnot possess adequate information on viable BOP enterprises. Thus, currently there is little \nfinance available for SMEs catering to the BOP sector. The existence of a viable project pipeline \nmay reduce the risks of such financing. There may still be need to establish further risk reduction \nmechanisms, such as guarantees or dedicated investment funds, to remove the hesitation in the \nmarket and catalyze such financing. This project expects to address these issues. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The expected impact of the project is strengthening inclusive growth in ADB\u2019s developing \nmember countries by enabling the BOP markets to integrate more fully in the formal economy. \nThis will provide opportunities for the BOP population to increase their productivity through \nhigher-value  job  creation  and  entrepreneurship.  It  will  also  provide  more  cost-efficient  and \neffective  service  delivery  to  the  low-income  groups  and  the  poor.  The  project\u2019s  expected \noutcomes will  be stronger  engagement  of  the  private  sector  with  the  BOP  market  through \ndemonstration of BOP opportunities, and better understanding of policy and institutional issues \namong policy makers.  \n \n ", "4   \n14.  The main outputs and activities of the project are (i) case studies of 40 BOP business \nenterprises identified and supported in India and Indonesia (these countries have been chosen \ndue to their middle-income nature and likelihood of greater success of demonstrating the BOP \napproach), (ii) a study to investigate the need for a pilot fund or guarantee and risk reduction \ninstruments, (iii) a publication based on the experiences of the project, and (iv) dissemination \nactivities.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n  1.  Case Studies on Enterprise Development \n \n15.  The project will develop case studies on enterprise development in India and Indonesia \nthrough (i) identification of potential BOP enterprises, (ii) supporting their development as viable \nbusinesses, and (iii) facilitating their financing tie-ups through investor forums and other means. \n \n(i)  Enterprise identification. Enterprises will be selected based on their suitability to \nserve the BOP sector and act as demonstration cases for the region. Selection \ncriteria will include (a) impact on the BOP segment; (b) innovative approach, \nscalability of their business models involving low-income groups as producers, \nconsumers, distributors, and entrepreneurs; and (c) viability, sustainability, and \ngrowth potential. Existing databases of NGOs and development partners will be \nused,  along  with  advertisements  in  media  and  websites,  to  obtain  candidate \nprojects.  \n(ii)  Enterprise development. The selected enterprises will receive some catalytic \nsupport on their business plans and developing business and financial skills. To \nthe  extent  possible,  the  TA  will  attempt  to  leverage  existing  local  enterprise \ndevelopment  networks  which  are  already  active  in  developing  socially  and \nenvironmentally sustainable SMEs serving the BOP market. 13  \n(iii)  Investor  forums.  Those enterprises that are found capable and with growth \npotential (about 20 each in India and Indonesia) will be provided with investment \nfacilitation support by showcasing them to potential financing groups such as \ncommercial banks and equity investors through investor forums.  \n \n2.  Study  of  Market  Potential  for  a  Base  of  the  Pyramid  Fund  and/or  Risk \nReduction Vehicle.   \n   \n16.  Due to financiers' perceptions of high risk about enterprises catering to the BOP segment, \na BOP fund and/or risk reduction vehicle is necessary to initiate a process of commercial \nfinancing of the BOP sector. Such a fund can provide debt, equity, or guarantees to potential \ninvestors. A study will be conducted to assess the potential for such a fund and/or risk reduction \nvehicle, and to determine its possible size and structure covering both countries. Should the \nstudy indicate the existence of a sizeable market, ADB may consider supporting such a fund or \nrisk reduction vehicle on a pilot basis to catalyze financing.    \n \n3.  Knowledge Development, Dissemination, and Exchange \n \n17.  A publication chronicling the learning process gained through the enterprise development \nprocess and findings on financing mentioned in paras. 15 and 16 will be produced. It will look \ncritically at the enterprise cases developed and assess their performance\u2014successes as well as \nshortcomings\u2014to understand the regulatory and market failures which (i) prevent the private \n                                                 \n13 Such as New Ventures; available: http://www.new-ventures.org/ \n ", "  5\nsector from exploiting the BOP, or (ii) prevent the poor and near poor from participating in the \nBOP more meaningfully. The publication will address both domestic and regional audiences, and \ntarget  policy  makers,  potential  investors,  and  entrepreneurs  in  order  to  produce  a  better \nunderstanding of the BOP market and help in developing appropriate policy and institutional \nchanges. In addition, dissemination and exchange forums will be conducted in order to reach the \nwidest possible audience and allow countries to learn and exchange experiences based on the \nIndia and Indonesia examples. Dissemination will also be conducted through websites14 and \nthrough knowledge networks,15 forums, and workshops.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n18.  The cost of the TA is $650,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  This project will be the first of two phases. The first phase will involve India and Indonesia; \nthe second phase will include the scoping of the creation of a social stock exchange in Asia to \nprovide finance for socially responsible and green enterprises in Asia. It may also extend this \ninitiative to other middle-income countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet Nam, \nwhere strong enterprise development networks for BOP SMEs have begun to be built.16   \n \n20.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for this TA, to be implemented by its Regional and \nSustainable Development Department in consultation with concerned regional departments and \nthe Private Sector Operations Department. The TA will be implemented over the period March \n2009\u2013September 2010. ADB will engage a firm of consultants to carry out the activities and \ndeliver  the  outputs  envisaged.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality \nand cost-based selection and simplified technical proposal. The quality-cost ratio norm17 will also \nbe applied in the evaluation of proposals. A total of 10 person-months of international and 50 \nperson-months of national consultancy will be required. Expertise is needed in the areas of BOP \nenterprise identification, development and financing for the enterprise development, and BOP \nmarket study components, and development economists or specialists familiar with the BOP \napproach are needed for the publication. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.18\n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis for \nPromoting Inclusive Growth through Business Development at the Base of the Pyramid, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14 Such as ADB\u2019s website (www.adb.org) and World Resources Institute\u2019s website (www.nextbillion.net). \n15 Including the soon to be established poverty network in Asia, supported by ADB. \n16 World Resources Institute, together with its local Chinese partner, New Ventures China, have started developing \nsuch networks in the People\u2019s Republic of China.
