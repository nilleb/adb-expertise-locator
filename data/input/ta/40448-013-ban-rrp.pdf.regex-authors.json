I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Teaching  Quality  Improvement  in \nSecondary Education Project (TQI-II).1 \n   \n2.  The project is a follow-on to the ongoing Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary \nEducation Project (TQI-I).2 In line with the government\u2019s National Education Policy (NEP), the \nproject will support the establishment of an integrated teacher education system to enhance the \nquality of teachers as a foundation for improving the overall quality of education.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Secondary education prepares students for employment at entry level and serves as a \nfoundation  for  those  who  aspire  to  advanced  studies.  In  Bangladesh,  growth  in  primary \neducation since the 1990s\u2212gross enrollment rate increased from 63% in 1995 to 108% in \n2010\u2212has resulted in a rapid expansion of the number of secondary schools, teachers, and \nenrollment and completion rates. Enrollment in secondary education has increased by more \nthan 150% since 1990. The number of secondary education institutions almost doubled in the \nsame period. In 2010, Bangladesh had 19,040 secondary schools (up from 18,500 in 2005) with \na total enrollment of 7.9 million (53% girls), and 8,146 madrasahs (religious schools) with an \nenrollment of 1.7 million (57% girls). The gross enrollment rate was 47% (49% for girls) in 2010 \nup from 43% (47% for girls) in 2005. Dropout rates have declined from 81% in 2005 (83% for \ngirls)  to  57%  (54%  for  girls)  in  2010  for  secondary  grades  6\u201310.  The  pass  rates  for  the \nsecondary school certificate have increased from 53% in 2005 to 78% in 2010; and from 59% in \n2005 to 72% in 2010 for the higher secondary school certificate. These achievements have \nbeen  possible  due  to  sustained  support  from  successive  governments  through  stipend \nprograms,  curriculum  improvements,  teacher  development  and,  more  recently,  a  focus  on \nstudent performance. \n \n4.  The percentage of untrained teachers has declined from 60% in 2004 to 33% in 2010, \nwhich is still high. The proportion of female teachers has increased gradually from 20% in 2005 \nto 23% in 2010. The government policy that at least 20% of teachers in rural schools and at \nleast 40% in urban schools should be female supported an increase in the number of schools \nwith female teachers. With the growth in the number of secondary institutions, the government\u2019s \nadministrative and supervisory capacity has been stretched, and it is now inadequate to fulfill its \nresponsibilities  effectively.  The  government  recognizes  the  need  to  strengthen  effective \nmonitoring and supervision of teacher training institutions and teachers in the classrooms to \ndeliver quality education at all levels. \n \n5.  Continuing investment in teacher development is essential as international research \nshows that a common feature of all successful education systems is a clear focus on teacher \nquality. While Bangladesh has made significant progress in providing access to secondary \neducation and has achieved gender parity up to grade 10, the quality of teaching, and hence \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople's Republic of Bangladesh for the Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project. Manila. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof Bangladesh for Preparing the Teaching Quality Improvement II. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \nstudent learning, continues to be a major concern. Students who complete secondary education \nare unprepared to enter the workforce in higher job categories or continue to tertiary education. \nPoor and disadvantaged students are the most affected since they have limited choice of \nschools,  cannot  afford  additional  tuition,  and  usually  come  from  a  social  background  that \nattaches  limited  value  to  education.  Girls'  enrollment  has  improved  significantly,  but  their \nperformance and retention deteriorate particularly after grade 9. In some areas, more girls are in \nschools  than  boys,  which  will  require measures  to  ensure  that  boys  attend  and  complete \nsecondary education. \n \n6.  A major constraint to the provision of quality secondary education in Bangladesh is the \nshortage  of  qualified  and  trained  secondary  school  teachers.  Overall  coordination  and \ninstitutional links between teacher training and oversight institutions are weak. Teaching as a \ncareer is not valued and there are no incentives to reward teaching effort and excellence. Lack \nof  motivation  and  absenteeism  among  teachers  are  widespread  although  improving.  The \nproblem is exacerbated by a lack of teacher and head teacher competency standards, on which \nto build a quality teacher training system. Also, teachers do not necessarily apply the modern \nstudent centered teaching skills acquired during training in the classroom. This is due to a \nmultitude of transfer obstacles (overcrowded classes, lack of incentives, lack of appropriate \nteaching and learning materials, poor supervision, etc.), which are difficult to overcome.  \n  \n7.  TQI-I has contributed to the training of more than 220,000 secondary teachers through \nthe adoption of policy reforms, the introduction of continuous professional development (CPD) \nprograms, the strengthening of teacher training institutions, and the development of a pool of \nteacher trainers. TQI-I has targeted classroom teaching and learning through a CPD approach, \nwhich includes supporting and monitoring the usage of student centered teaching approaches. \nAn initial assessment by TQI-I found that TQI-I training had made a significant impact on the \nclassroom  performance  of  the  observed  teachers  in  more  than  70%  of  the  schools.  The \nassessment measured the usage of student centered teaching skills as instructed during the \nCPD. With the support of TQI-I, the Nongovernment Teachers Registration and Certification \nAuthority (NTRCA) was established by law to institute a common set of quality standards for \nregistering eligible teachers and recruiting them through school management committees. The \ngovernment  also  established  the  National  Teacher  Education  Council  (NTEC)  to  common \nstandards for teacher training providers. However, the NTEC has not become fully functional. \nThe curriculum and textbooks are undergoing major revisions to move away from rote learning \nand into creative thinking and practical work skills. With these efforts, progress is being made \ntoward developing and fully implementing an integrated teacher quality assurance system.  \n \n8.  TQI-II draws on the following lessons from TQI-I and the country assistance program \nevaluation:4 (i)  changing  classroom  practices  and  teacher  behavior  requires  reinforcement \nthrough  CPD  instead  of  ad  hoc  one-off  training;  (ii)  pre-service  teacher  education  should \nemphasize  subject  knowledge  with  skills  in  pedagogy  anchored  in  approved  teacher \ncompetencies; (iii) in-service training should contribute to teacher qualification requirements for \nregistration; (iv) effective teacher training requires strong coordination and shared commitment \namong central, field, and school stakeholders; (v) head teachers should serve as instructional \nleaders  to  monitor,  mentor,  and  motivate  teachers  to  apply  new  knowledge  and  skills  to \ntransform teaching and learning in the classroom; (vi) initial efforts to establish an integrated \nteacher training system should be sustained with adequate expertise and budget; and (vii) \nproject-based support from development partners should be harmonized and aligned with the \ncountry system and policy priorities.  \n                                                \n4  Asian Development Bank. 2009. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Bangladesh. Manila. \n ", "         3 \n \n \n9.  TQI-II  provides  the  following  special  features  and  innovations  to  enhance  teacher \nquality: (i) introducing standard competencies for teachers and head teachers, and designing all \ntraining based on standard competencies; (ii) strengthening school-level leadership to mentor \nand monitor teachers\u2019 classroom performance; (iii) promoting partnerships between universities \nand teacher training colleges (TTCs) to improve teachers\u2019 subject knowledge and pedagogical \npractices;  (iv)  developing  centers  of  excellence  at  selected  TTCs  for  teaching  English, \nmathematics, and science; (v) piloting computer-aided teaching and learning; (vi) providing \nincentives to make education more inclusive; and (vii) strengthening financial management \nprocedures  to  mitigate fiduciary  risks. These features  and  innovations  are  building  on  the \nachievements and identified gaps of TQI-I.5  \n \n10.  With the approval by Parliament of the NEP in 2010, the government embarked on a \nprogram of comprehensive reform to strengthen equitable access, quality, and relevance of \neducation in Bangladesh. In 2011, a new phase of the primary education reform program \nstarted, with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as one of the key partners. TQI-I and TQI-II \nare core building blocks in strengthening the quality of secondary education as envisaged in the \nNEP.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  Ministry  of Education (MOE) to  develop  a  road map  to \nimplement the NEP, with a focus on developing a sector-wide approach in secondary education, \nin consultation with development partners. While only a few development partners (ADB, the \nCanadian International Development Agency, the Department for International Development of \nthe United Kingdom, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund [UNICEF], and the World Bank, etc.) \nare currently involved in secondary education, more are likely to join. A sector-wide approach is \nbeing  discussed  to  strengthen  overall  coordination  and  leadership  of  the  government  in \npartnership with the private sector and civil society. TQI-II is in line with the Country Partnership \nStrategy, 2011\u20132015 and the Sixth Five Year Plan; both emphasize improving the quality and \nrelevance of education and the skills shortage.6   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  of  TQI-II  is  improved  learning  outcomes  in  secondary  education.  The \noutcome is a strengthened, integrated, and more inclusive secondary teacher education system.  \n \nC.  Outputs  \n12.  The  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  four  outputs:  (i)  strengthened  teacher \ndevelopment  and  institutional  and  organizational  capacity;  (ii)  enhanced  teacher  training \nprograms and delivery systems (pre-service, in-service including CPD); (iii) targeted support for \ninclusive education; and (iv) quality project management.  \n \n13.  Output 1: Strengthened teacher development and institutional and organizational \ncapacity.  The  project  will  support  the  NTEC,  NTRCA,  training  providers7,  and  DSHE  in \ndeveloping  an  integrated  quality  assurance  system  of  setting  and  implementing  national \nstandard  competencies for  teachers  and  head teachers  in  order to  improve  the quality  of \nsecondary education teachers. This output will be achieved through the following four activities:  \n                                                \n5  TQI-I Achievements, Gaps and Issues, and Implications for TQI-II (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2011.

Dhaka. \n7  Training providers include government and private TTCs, higher secondary teacher training institutes, Bangladesh \nMadrasah Teacher Training Institute and universities.  \n ", "4 \n \n(i)  The institutional and policy framework will be strengthened to support the role of \nthe NTEC, NTRCA, training providers, and DSHE. Roles and responsibilities for \nsetting standard competencies for teachers and minimum standards for training \nproviders,  registering  teachers  and  maintaining  registration,  aligning  teacher \ntraining programs with the competencies, and monitoring classroom performance \nwill be articulated. A 1-year costed action plan will be prepared to implement \ninstitutional and organizational reforms. A study to propose an attractive teacher \ncareer path will be undertaken. \n(ii)  The capacity of the DSHE to use evidence-based planning and management to \ndevelop and monitor teacher quality will be strengthened. \n(iii)  School-level leadership will be strengthened to monitor and mentor teachers\u2019 \nclassroom performance. Head teachers will be trained to become instructional \nleaders. \n(iv)  Partnership arrangements with government, public and private training providers, \nand information technology companies will strengthen teacher education and \nteaching  practice.  The  results  orientation  of  the  existing  innovation  and \ndevelopment funding mechanisms will be further strengthened to improve the \nquality of training, teaching, and learning in secondary education. \n \n14.  Output 2: Enhanced teacher training programs and delivery systems. The project \nwill  enhance  pre-service  education  and  in-service  training  (short-term  certificate training to \nprepare teachers to attain registration and CPD to upgrade teachers\u2019 knowledge and skills). All \ntraining  programs  will  be  aligned  with  the  standard  competencies  for  teachers  and  head \nteachers  to  ensure  synergy  from  different  training  programs  within  an  integrated  teacher \ndevelopment framework. This output will be achieved through five activities:  \n(i)  A  modernized  and  integrated  pre-service  teacher  education  program  will  be \nimplemented. A bachelor\u2019s degree program (3- or 4-year program) on a technical \nsubject will be closely linked with a 1-year pedagogical training program. This will \nbe achieved through establishing partnerships between universities and TTCs. \nThe completion of both programs will lead to a bachelor\u2019s degree of education or \na  master\u2019s  degree  of  education.    The  current  1-year  pedagogical  training \nprogram will be revised based on the standard competencies for teachers. \n(ii)  Teachers  will  be  assisted  to  attain  registration  and  formal  qualification  by \nproviding  short-term  certificate  training  programs  and  adopting recognition  of \nprior learning schemes that will credit teachers for previous training.  \n(iii)  Teachers  will  be  assisted  to  update  knowledge  and  skills  for  maintaining \nregistration through CPD. CPD programs will be developed under the project with \na special focus on computer-aided learning in the classroom.  \n(iv)  Computer-aided teaching and learning will be piloted in 27 selected schools and \nTTCs covering the nine zones (administrative divisions for secondary education \nmanagement). \n(v)  The capacity of teacher training providers will be strengthened by establishing \ntraining  facilities  in  51  cluster  center  schools,  including  public  and \nnongovernment schools, in areas that do not have any teacher training facilities. \nThis capacity will also be enhanced by providing additional resources to eligible \ntraining providers, and by developing centers of excellence at selected TTCs for \nteaching English, mathematics, and science. \n  \n15.  Output  3:  Targeted  support  for  inclusive  education.  The  project  will  support \nincreasing  the  proportion  of female  teachers  and female members  of  school  management \ncommittees,  and  will  target  disadvantaged  areas  with  low  student  performance.  Inclusive \n ", "         5 \n \neducation principles will be explicitly included in all teacher training activities. This output will be \nachieved through three main activities:  \n(i)  Inclusiveness of education will be further strengthened by developing a new \ntraining policy, engaging civil society in advocacy, and targeting remedial classes \nin disadvantaged areas where student performance is lagging.  \n(ii)  Participation of female teachers and teachers from disadvantaged groups will be \nincreased by targeting scholarships to attract female teachers and by providing \nincentive  packages  to  teachers,  especially  women,  to  seek  appointments  in \ndisadvantaged areas.  \n(iii)  Proportion  of  female  members  in  school  management  committees  will  be \nincreased  to  25%  by  running  advocacy  campaigns  and  providing  capacity \nbuilding training.  \n \n16.  Output 4: Quality project management. The project will improve project management, \nwith a focus on financial management to mitigate risks associated with  organizing a large \nvolume of training sessions. Monitoring and reporting will be strengthened with a focus on \nteacher performance. This output will be achieved through two activities:  \n(i)  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  strengthened  to  implement \nenhanced financial management procedures, especially for training sessions in \nthe field, provide efficient support to the project steering committee (PSC) and \nproject  implementation  committee  (PIC),  mobilize  partnership  and  ensure \neffective  working  arrangement  for  consultants.  The  MOE  will  ensure  timely \nmobilization of PMU staff with appropriate expertise.  \n(ii)  Stronger monitoring and reporting will be ensured by the DSHE preparing an \nannual  teacher  performance  review  report,  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of \nEducational  Information  and  Statistics  undertaking  a  biennial  census  of \nsecondary  education  teachers,  and  the  PMU  preparing  regular  analytical \nmonitoring and evaluation reports focusing on teacher performance.       \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Economic viability. The economic viability of the project has been assessed based on \nthe benefits and costs associated with TQI-II. The benefits include improved teacher quality, \nand a reduction in internal inefficiency of education. The priced economic benefits include (i) \ndirect benefit for teachers in terms of increased productivity and wages, (ii) improved internal \nefficiency for reducing system wastage caused by dropouts and repetition, and (iii) improved \nexternal efficiency for students with increased employability and higher wages (enhanced value \nfor money). The three major streams of economic costs are (i) the direct project cost; (ii) indirect \nproject-related costs including replacement and or upgrading of capital investments, such as \ncomputer  and  laboratory  equipment,  and  additional  operational  and  maintenance  costs \ngenerated by new infrastructure beyond the project period to sustain the project benefits; and \n(iii) costs to cover salary increases for newly trained teachers. The project is estimated to yield a \nnet present value of $64.5 million. The economic internal rate of return associated with this net \npresent value is estimated at 22.7%, assuming a discount rate of 12%. This suggests that TQI-II \nwill be a sound investment.9 \n \n                                                \n9  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n24.  Fiscal  sustainability.  The  financial  affordability  and  sustainability  of  the  project  is \nanalyzed  based  on  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework  in  the  National  Strategy  for \nAccelerated Poverty Reduction II, 2009\u20132012 and the Sixth Five Year Plan (footnote 6). The \nTQI-II allocation ranges from 3% to 8% of secondary education expenditure during the project \nperiod.  While  the  government  is  committed  to  allocate  the  required  budget  for  teacher \ndevelopment, government funds would be inadequate to meet training needs without ADB \ncontribution.  Developing  an  integrated  teacher  development  system  will  require  sustained \ninvestments. The long-term sustainability of TQI-II will depend on two factors: (i) the ability of \nthe  government  to  allocate  adequate  budget  for  teacher  development  over  time,  and  (ii) \nimprovements in efficiency and quality. Given the positive outlook for gross domestic product \ngrowth and the NEP\u2019s call for major reforms, allocations to the education sector are expected to \nincrease and secondary education will receive more resources.  \n  \nB.  Governance \n  \n25.  Rigorous financial due diligence work was carried out by reviewing the arrangements \nunder the ongoing TQI-I. Based on this analysis the following measures are incorporated to \nimprove  governance:  (i)  provision  of  adequate  relevant  staff  in  the  PMU;  (ii)  inclusion  of \ntechnical  experts  on  the  PIC  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  technical  aspects  of \nproposed reforms, including aligning all types of teacher training with teacher and head teacher \nstandard competencies; (iii) introduction of partnership arrangements for quality assurance; (iv) \nstrengthening school-level leadership by institutionalizing monitoring of teachers\u2019 classroom \nperformance with DSHE oversight to ensure accountability; and (v) emphasis on advocacy \ncampaigns for creating awareness, applying transparent criteria and procedures for selection of \npartner institutions and training programs, and disclosure of information on the project website. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe  government,  MOE,  and  DSHE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 8). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  There is a growing consensus among government, nongovernment organizations, and \nprofessionals that inclusion of marginalized groups in mainstream schooling is the only way to \nprovide means for education and learning for all children. Despite rapid growth in secondary \nenrollment, around 57% of the students drop out. This rate is much higher for students from \npoor and disadvantaged groups. These students are most affected since they have limited \neducational options. Building on the TQI-I experience, TQI-II will focus on (i) providing remedial \nclasses in the most lagging upazilas, where student performance in secondary and higher \nsecondary  school  certificates  is  low;  (ii)  establishing  training  facilities  in  51  cluster  center \nschools in districts that do not have facilities to train teachers to serve disadvantaged groups; \nand (iii) piloting computer aided teaching and learning in 27 schools and TTCs to reduce poverty \nby enhancing access to better quality education. \n \n27.  Gender  and  development.  Bangladesh  has  achieved  gender  parity  in  secondary \neducation enrollment and retention. The proportion of female teachers in secondary schools \nalso  shows  an  increasing  trend.  The  provision  of  two  female  members  on  the  school \nmanagement committees has created a positive environment for recruitment and retention of \nfemale teachers. The project includes (i) undertaking mass awareness programs to encourage \nand attract women to the teaching profession; (ii) raising general awareness with emphasis on \nthe  positive  accomplishments  and  successes  of  female  teachers;  (iii)  structuring  incentive \npackages, especially for remote and rural areas, to motivate female teachers to join and remain \n ", "         9 \n \nin the teaching profession; and (iv) introducing mechanisms to increase the proportion of female \nmembers on school management committees (from 15.7% to 25% in 2016). The gender action \nplan  prepared  and  implemented  under  TQI-I  has  been  updated  to  (i)  help  upazilas  and \nsecondary  education  institutions  in  rural  areas  achieve  the  target  of  at  least  20%  female \nteachers;  and  (ii)  enhance  the  proportion  of  female  members  on  school  management \ncommittees to at least 25%.10 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment (category C). TQI-II will support construction of training facilities in 51 \ncluster  center  schools.  The  project  has  adequate  arrangements  for  site  selection,  design, \nconstruction, operations, maintenance, and compliance measures, and is not expected to create \nany significant or long-term adverse environmental impact. An environmental assessment and \nreview framework (EARF) has been prepared, and the subprojects for construction of training \nfacilities  and  other  civil  works  will  be  identified  after  the  Board  approval.  The  EARF  has \nadequate  provisions  to  respond  to  any  environmental  issue  that  may  arise  during  TQI-II \nimplementation. The borrower also has shown interest in adopting environmental safeguards \nand compliance measures, along with strengthening institutional capacity and committing to \nmanage  environmental  risks  and  fully  implement  the  EARF.  The  DSHE  will  prepare  and \ndisclose  semi-annual  monitoring  reports  that  describe  progress  with  implementation  of  the \nEARF, and compliance issues and corrective actions, if any. \n   \n29.  Resettlement (category C). Social safeguard issues are not expected to arise since no \nmajor construction is anticipated. The proposed construction of training venues in cluster center \nschools is limited to the extension of small structures within the existing school premises. \nSubprojects for the construction of teaching facilities will be identified after the Board approval. \nTherefore, a resettlement framework has been prepared for the project, to ensure that any issue \nthat may invoke ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement policy would be adequately addressed. The \nborrower has also demonstrated adequate institutional capacity, and commitment to manage \nsocial risks and properly implement the resettlement framework. \n \n30.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Three  districts\u2014Bandarban,  Khagrachari,  and \nRangamati, in Chittagong Hill Tracts\u2014are home to the largest proportion of the country\u2019s small \nethnic communities. The rest are dispersed and generally live in isolated settlements among the \nmainstream  population.  Under  TQI-II,  one  outreach  center  established  under  TQI-I  will  be \nstrengthened and two cluster center schools will be established to serve the target population. \nThe subprojects for construction of teaching facilities will be identified after the Board approval. \nA small ethnic communities planning framework has been developed for the project, which \ndefines possible mitigating measures.11 The borrower has also shown adequate institutional \ncapacity and commitment to manage the social risks and to comply with information disclosure \nand consultation requirements through implementation of the framework. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Among  the  key  project  implementation  risks  and  mitigating  measures,  four  are \nsummarized here. First, sufficient budget allocations must be provided to sustain continuous \nprofessional development activities after the project ends. Since these training programs should \nbe provided regularly to reinforce changes in teaching and learning practices, the continuation \n                                                \n10  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  The planning framework is in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n ", "10 \n \nof follow-up training is crucial under the government\u2019s revenue budget. Second, teacher training \nmust be made more responsive to quality improvements and labor market needs. This will be \naddressed  by  implementing  teacher  and  head  teacher  competencies,  with  head  teachers \nmentoring  teachers  and  monitoring  teachers\u2019  classroom  performance.  The  project  also \nproposes partnering with selected universities to make training providers more relevant and \nresponsive. Third, increased in-service teacher training is likely to disrupt regular classes since \nparticipating teachers may be out of class without proper arrangements for substitute teachers. \nTQI-II proposes to conduct all training programs during holidays or periods when classroom \nactivities are least likely to be affected (after exams, or at the beginning of the academic year). \nFinally, fiduciary risks associated with training sessions conducted in the field will be mitigated \nby  enhancing  financial  management,  reducing  advances  for  training,  ensuring  quarterly \nreconciliation between bank statements and expenditure reporting from each training venue, \nand introducing a system of sample verification of training participants. In addition, to strengthen \nchecks and balances no single agency will be made responsible for both teacher nomination for \ntraining programs and reporting participation of teachers in training. Selection of teachers for \ntraining will be done from an enhanced and up-to-date education management information \nsystem. \n  \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n32.  The government, MOE, and DSHE have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government, MOE, and DSHE \nhave agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan \nagreement.  \n \n33.  To ensure funds are used for their intended purpose, the government and ADB will \nagree on the detailed eligibility criteria, selection process, and disbursement procedures for \ntraining  activities,  partnership  grants,  grants  for  innovation  and  development,  and  teacher \nincentive packages before withdrawals can be made for these expenditures. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR45,120,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second \nTeaching Quality  Improvement  in  Secondary  Education  Project from ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n   \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n8 March 2012\n ", "  Appendix 1        11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  Range between secondary school  National examination results  Assumption \ncertificate examination pass rate of  (annual) \nImproved  NEP implemented, \ntop 10% and bottom 10% upazilas : \nlearning  leading to formal \n10% by 2020 (2010 baseline: 24.3%) \noutcomes in  registration of all teachers \n(m/f) \nsecondary  to monitor if NEP \neducation   Range between higher secondary  National examination results  qualification and other \nschool certificate examination pass  (annual)  applicable requirements \n \nrate between top 10% and bottom  are met by all teachers  by \n10% of upazilas :15% by 2020 (2010  2017 \nbaseline: 30.3%) (m/f) \nOutcome  Percentage of teachers showing use  Impact study TQI-I 2012  Assumptions \nof teaching competencies in the  (baseline) \nStrengthened,  classroom by 2017 (m/f)a   Government and key \nintegrated, and  Annual teacher  stakeholders support \nmore inclusive  performance report  partnership between \nsecondary  TTCs and universities to \nPercentage of incumbent secondary  Annual teacher \nteacher  make teacher training \nteachers meeting NEP qualification  performance report  \neducation  more responsive  \nrequirements: 90% by 2017 for all \nsystem  \nteachers and for female teachers  Government provides \n(2010 baseline: 66.5% for all  strong support for gender \nteachers, 70.3 % for female teachers)   equity and pro-poor \ntargeted investments \nPercentage of new secondary  Annual teacher \nteacher recruits meeting NEP  performance report   Government increases \nqualification requirements: 100% by  financing to \n2017 (m/f) a   NCTRA data base  institutionalize and \nsustain improvements in \nPercentage of schools meeting  Annual teacher  teacher quality \nfemale teachers target (20% in rural  performance report \nschools, 40% in urban schools): \n100% by 2017 (2010 Baseline: 43%)  \nPercentage of female teachers: 28%  Annual teacher \nby 2017 (2010 baseline: 23%)   performance report \n \nOutputs  One-year action plan approved to  Approved one year action  Assumptions \nformally adopt organization and  plan \n1.
