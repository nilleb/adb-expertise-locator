The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been requested to provide technical assistance \n(TA) for a techno-economic assessment to help prepare the Central Asia\u2013South Asia Regional \nElectricity Market (CASAREM) power transmission project (the Project) The World Bank was \nrequested to support the countries through an institutional, financial, risk mitigation, and legal \nframework study (commercial assessment). The Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan in Central Asia, \nand Afghanistan and Pakistan in South Asia have been pursuing the development of a regional \nelectricity  market.  To  examine  the  possibilities  for  regional  electricity  trade,  the  countries, \ntogether with international financial institutions and private sector  met in Islamabad (May 2006), \nIstanbul  (June  2006),  Manila  (October  2006),  and  Dushanbe  (October  2006).  Significant \nprogress was made during the Multi-Country Working Group (MCWG) meeting, which was \nhosted by ADB and held in Manila on 5 and 6 October 2006. Concept clearance was given on \n24  October  2006.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  on  project  development  was  signed \nbetween the countries on 29 October 2006 at the Second CASAREM Conference. Fact-finding \nwas undertaken through consultations during the conferences and the MCWG meeting. The \ngovernments  agreed  on  the impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  and \noutline terms of reference of the consultants. The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1.1 \n   \nII.   ISSUES \n2.  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan  have  significant  electricity  shortages  and  need  to  meet \nincreasing demand.  Importing  electricity  is  becoming  more  important  in  their strategies  for \nenergy supply security, in addition to building power generation plants. Neighboring Central \nAsian countries\u2014the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan\u2014have electricity surpluses available for \nexport and are actively looking for export markets. They also have the potential to increase \nsupply  by  developing  additional  low-cost  hydropower  generation  facilities.  Some  electricity \ninterconnections  already  exist  between  Afghanistan  and  Central  Asian  countries,  notably \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, but there is scope for expansion. Construction of a \n220-kilovolt  line  between  Uzbekistan  and  Afghanistan  is  already  under  way  (with  financial \nassistance from ADB, the Government of India, and the World Bank), and a similar project is \nunder consideration for an Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan connection with potential ADB financing.2 The \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, with their large hydropower resources, have been seeking \nopportunities to expand electricity exports to Afghanistan and beyond to South Asia. \n \n3.  Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan have been pursuing the \ndevelopment of electricity trading arrangements and the establishment of CASAREM, together \nwith international financial institutions and the private sector. The initial plan is to export a \nminimum of 1,000 megawatts (MW) from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and \nPakistan. Although the preference for Pakistan would be year-round supply of 1,000 MW, \nagreement has been reached on seasonal supply for the initial period. Pakistan expressed \ninterest in increasing imports over the medium term beyond the initial 1,000 MW.   \n   \n4.  Any electricity trade project has risks, and CASAREM has some specific ones. General \nrisks include: governments basing their decisions more on political than economic rationales.  \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 25 October 2006.  \n2  ADB.  2006.  Draft  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  on  the  Proposed  REG:  Regional  Power \nTransmission Interconnection Project. Manila (Afghanistan: loan of $35 million and TA of $1.2 million; Tajikistan: \nloan of $21.5 million and TA of $1.5 million) \n ", "2   \nThis has delayed or and impeded other projects.  Electricity trade projects have financial risks \nas  off-take risk  of  the importers  and  compensation  risk of  the  transmission  providers  and \nexporters when they fail to meet their contracted obligations. Legal and regulatory risks include \ninability  to  enforce  contracts  and  changes  in  laws  or  regulations,  which  makes  projects \neconomically  unsustainable.  Projects  can  likewise  face  political  violence  or  sabotage. \nCASAREM  also  faces  technical  risks  in  crossing  high  mountains  and  rugged  terrain,  and \ntechnical losses. These risks must be mitigated if the Project is to be economically attractive for \nthe countries and to attract financing from commercial partners. Active partnership to address all \nrisks and clear decision points before progressing with the Project will be necessary to start the \nelectricity trade by 2010. The first decision point was the memorandum of understanding (MOU) \nfor CASAREM signed at the Dushanbe conference. The second will be the intergovernmental \nagreement scheduled for mid 2007 when the final decision to proceed with the Project is made.   \n \n5.  ADB has been active in CASAREM meetings and conferences. At the first MCWG \nmeeting in Manila, the countries reconfirmed their keen interest in going forward with the Project \nand agreed to accelerate its processing and implementation to start the electricity trade by 2010. \nThe MCWG requested ADB support for the techno-economic feasibility study. Through the \nMOU, the countries endorsed the terms of reference for the two studies to be undertaken by \nADB and World Bank   The signing of the MOU in Dushanbe also commits the countries to \npursue the feasibility of the transmission and trading system with the concomitant institutional \nand  legal  framework  for  the  1,000  MW  power  transfer  and  confirms  that  private  sector \nparticipation will be given preference. Once its feasibility is established, the MOU commit the \ncountries to pursue it until financial closure.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  purpose  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  is  to  enhance  the  electricity  trade  and \noptimize the region\u2019s power resources. It will prepare the Project, which in its initial stage will \nexport  1,000  MW  of  electricity  from  Tajikistan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  Pakistan  and \nAfghanistan.  The  resulting  Project  will  support  the  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  strategy  of \nincreasing power supply to meet its economic growth targets, enable the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan  to  earn  revenues  through  the  use  of  their  hydroelectric  resources,  and  enable \nAfghanistan  to  earn  wheeling  charges  for  the  transit  of  electricity  and  have  access  to  an \nadditional source of electricity.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The study will have two phases. Phase 1 will confirm the preliminary feasibility and \neconomic viability of the Project. It will involve (i) an assessment of power availability and the \ncost of power supply options in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan for export and domestic \ndemand;  (ii) an assessment of the need for power in Pakistan and the marginal cost of \nalternatives compared with imports to satisfy the need, as well as Afghanistan\u2019s need and ability \nto import power; (iii) a preliminary analysis assessing the transmission route and the costs from \nthe Kyrgyz Republic to Tajikistan and through Kabul, Afghanistan, to Pakistan and additional \nroutes including those through eastern Tajikistan; (iv) an estimate to identify and provide the \ncosts for the preferred transmission link options, including alternative technologies and voltage \nlevels; and (v) route survey and preliminary environmental and social impact assessments.   \n \n ", "  3\n8.  If the countries decide to proceed, phase 2 will prepare the full feasibility study to \nestablish the detailed route and costs. Full social and environmental impact assessments will \nalso be carried out. Phase 2 will identify the Project\u2019s technical risks and ways of mitigating \nthem.  \n \n9.  The consultants will be required to use, to the extent possible, existing data and studies \nand  analyses  and  will  undertake  extensive  field  work.  The  outputs  are  the  technical  and \neconomic  viability  assessment  and  social  and  environmental  impact  assessments.  The \nconsultants will work closely with the commercial assessment team to ensure that there is no \nduplication of effort and that assessments from each study are reflected in the other. At each \nphase of the TA, the consultants will transfer knowledge to the staff of the governments and \nelectric utilities by working closely with them. The consultants will train staff to use the software \ndeveloped or augmented in the course of the TA, including that for load flow simulation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The estimated cost of the TA is $3,337,000 equivalent. The MCWG has requested ADB \nto finance $3,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's TA \nfunding  program.  The  governments  of  Afghanistan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Pakistan,  and \nTajikistan will provide $337,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and other \nexpenditures (Appendix 3). The governments have been informed that approval of the TA does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  ADB will be the Executing Agency in close consultation with the MCWG for CASAREM, \nconsisting  of  representatives  from  the  governments  of  Afghanistan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nPakistan, and Tajikistan. The TA will be coordinated with the World Bank\u2019s consultant team for \nthe commercial assessment. Each country will have a project development unit, with designated \nstaff from that country. A coordinating unit will be set up in one country and will include an \ninternational consultant who will be the project coordinator. The TA will provide funding for office \nequipment. The TA will engage international consultants for 54 person-months and national \nconsultants for 81 person-months. The international consultants will have extensive experience \nin preparing a project of this nature. Specialists in transmission technology, substations, system \noperation,  economic  assessment,  financial  analysis  and  social  and  environmental  impact \nassessment will be required. The national consultants will have expertise in these areas in \naddition to being abreast of developments in their countries and areas of specialization. Phase 1 \nis expected to take 3.5 months, and phase 2, 15.0 months. The outline terms of reference and \nreporting  arrangements  are  in  Appendix  4.  Tripartite  meetings,  involving  the  MCWG, \nconsultants, and ADB, will be held after the submission of the inception, interim, and draft final \nreports. The consultants will submit progress reports to the MCWG and ADB. A consulting firm \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April \n2006, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited in accordance with quality- \nand cost-based selection procedures, and simplified technical proposals will be requested. \nProcurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, \nas amended from time to time). Equipment procured under the TA will be used to implement the \nProject and be turned over to the governments thereafter. The TA will begin in January 2007 \nand be completed by July 2008.   \n \n \n ", "4   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n12.

The consultants\u2019 scope of work for this project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the \nCentral Asia South Asia Regional Electricity Market will have two phases and four tasks. Phase 1 \nwill  be  the  preliminary  feasibility  and  economic  viability  study.  Based  on  the  study\u2019s \nrecommendations, the governments will confirm that they would like to proceed with the Project. \nThe tasks are as follows: (i) assess the availability and cost of power supply options in Tajikistan \nand the Kyrgyz Republic; (ii) assess the need for power in Pakistan and the cost of alternatives to \nimports to satisfy these needs, and Afghanistan\u2019s ability to take and use additional power; (iii) \ndetermine the transmission options, route, and costs, and  identify, as part of the foregoing, the \nProject\u2019s technical risks and ways of mitigating them; and (iv) conduct an environmental and social \nassessment to determine the route, and a detailed assessment of the route chosen. The legal, \nregulatory, and financial risks are being examined through the commercial study supported by the \nWorld Bank. Because of the intertwining nature of the risks and other components of the two \nstudies, the consultants for both teams will work together to reflect their findings as well as to avoid \nduplication of efforts.  \n \n2.  The phase-2 feasibility study will cover four major areas: (i) compliance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) safeguard policies; (ii) economic and financial evaluations; (iii) links \nbetween economic growth, poverty, and the power sector; and (iv) technical project design.  \n \n3.  The consultants will work with the Multi-Country Working Group (MCWG) and the project \ndirector, who will be responsible for the overall coordination and project development units in each \ncountry. For all material and software resulting from or used to conduct the project preparatory TA, \nthe consultants will transfer knowledge and provide hands-on training to the members of the units \nand others as requested.  \n \nA.
