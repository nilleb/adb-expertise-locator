The Proposal \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation and \nimplementation support, policy advice, and capacity development for projects and investment \nprograms in the urban development and water sector of the Southeast Asia (SEA) region.1It will \n \nsupport  the  Southeast  Asia  Urban  Development  and  Water  Division  (SEUW)  in  delivering \nintegrated and innovative solutions for cities by forging long-term partnerships with these cities \nthrough investments in resilient urban infrastructure and policy and regulatory support to enhance \ninstitutional  effectiveness.  The  TA  facility  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational \npriorities and will support the delivery of solutions for (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) making cities more livable; \n(iv)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; and (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 The \nTA  facility  also  supports  implementation  of  the  country  partnership  strategies  and  country \noperations business plans for ADB developing member countries (DMCs) in the SEA region. \n \n2.  Sector Challenges  \n2.  Rapid urbanization and increased climate change risks. Countries in the SEA region \ncontinue to experience rapid urbanization and its cities are particularly exposed to climate change-\nrelated events such as temperature and sea level rises, changes in rainfall patterns, flooding, and \ndrought. These natural hazards are increasing in frequency and severity. Risks are exacerbated \nby the lack of resilient urban infrastructure to respond to such challenges and threats.  \n \n3.  Impact of the coronavirus disease. Given the strong water\u2013sanitation\u2013hygiene\u2013health \nlinkage, water shortage, deterioration in water quality and lack of basic sanitation services will \nadversely impact the health of communities in SEA cities, disproportionately for the poor and \nvulnerable. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the importance of \nuniversal access to safe drinking water and sanitation. It has also shown the fundamental need \nfor resilient operation of water services to ensure uninterrupted supply to all water consumers. \nWomen and girls have traditionally played vital roles in both securing sufficient water for the \nhousehold and ensuring the health of family members, including caring for the sick, and this has \nbeen in greater evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n4.  Service  delivery  gaps  and  low  resilience.  It  is  estimated  that  the  total  annual \ninfrastructure investment requirement in the SEA region is about $210 billion.3 The associated \ngap in service delivery remains even more pressing in many SEA countries, where robust efforts \nto address the inadequate levels of resilience of urban infrastructure are lacking. Many cities in \nthe SEA region exhibit declining livability and increasing levels of poverty, which are further \nexacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n \n1  A list of ensuing projects supported by the TA facility is detailed in Appendix 2. The ensuing projects are listed in the \nrelevant country operations business plans. Additional projects may be added as they are agreed with the relevant \ngovernments. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Inadequate  technical  capacity.  Lack  of  effective  urban  planning  has  resulted  in \nunplanned development and urban sprawl in SEA cities, compounded by inadequate technical \nstandards for planning, design, and construction of urban infrastructure, and insufficient attention \nto asset management, and operation and maintenance. This hinders local governments\u2019 and \nservice providers\u2019 ability to respond to the increasing need for well-planned urban development \nand reliable service delivery. Resilience should be a key objective for all urban infrastructure \nprojects; however, often it is given due consideration only in a subset of projects. \n \n6.  Weak institutional capacity. Key urban services delivery entities in many SEA countries \nhave inadequate institutional structures and fragmented arrangements to deliver improved and \nexpanded urban services. Typically, multiple institutions oversee management of urban services, \nwhich often have complex relationships and overlapping mandates. The enabling environment for \npolicy and regulatory frameworks, planning, and financing systems is weak and poorly framed. \n \n7.  Lack of financial sustainability. Many of the urban service providers in the SEA region \nreceive limited financial support through tax, tariff, and other income sources, while some receive \nmodest subsidy from central government. However, many do not receive intergovernmental \nsupport and have limited local income source and are in financial distress\u2014the growth rate of \noperating expenses exceeds that of revenue, with little capital for expansion of services. Most \nurban services providers are hampered by an inadequate revenue stream, compounded by the \nabsence of well-regulated tariff systems and prudent financial management practices.  \n \n8.  Lack of inclusive participation of stakeholders. Resilient cities can absorb, recover \nfrom, and prepare for natural hazards and human-made disasters and can manage the impact of \nshocks. While engagement with communities is critical to have their opinions and needs reflected \nand addressed in the planning and operation of basic urban services, this is often lacking. For \nexample, women and girls face additional challenges because they are often responsible for \nmanaging household services and have different sanitation needs. However, women, girls, and \nother marginalized groups are disproportionately affected by limited participation in key decisions.  \n \n3.  Delivery of Integrated Solutions  \n9.  The future urban and water projects of ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department will focus on \nenhancing livability by mainstreaming innovative approaches to the development of resilient urban \ninfrastructure and service delivery. The TA facility will be pivotal in driving SEUW\u2019s projects to \nhave a sharper focus on holistic approaches to developing cities that are inclusive, competitive, \nlivable, and resilient. Further, the TA facility will adopt a strong focus on gender mainstreaming4 \nas a cross-cutting theme. \n \n10.  The TA facility will support the preparation of SEUW\u2019s investment projects from 2021 to \n2024 to promote integrated solutions that will benefit from long-term partnerships with cities and \nkey government agencies, in consideration of the need for effective regulation, enhanced urban \nservice  delivery,  and  robust  institutional  effectiveness.  It  aims  to  provide  complementary \ninterventions to holistically address multiple urban issues and foster close cooperation with other \ndevelopment partners. In leveraging outcomes from this integrated approach, the TA facility will \nalso identify good practice for dissemination and replication.  \n \n \n4 All ensuing loan projects supported by the TA facility will have gender category of effective gender mainstreaming.  \n ", "3 \n4.  Benefits of a TA Facility  \n11.  The  Southeast  Asia  Urban  Services  Facility  (SURF),5  the  proposed  TA  facility\u2019s \npredecessor, has demonstrated that this modality (i) optimizes the use of ADB resources and \nenhances implementation effectiveness; (ii) reduces the response time in providing solutions to \nthe needs of DMCs through  consistent approaches to urban solutions; (iii) increases the quality \nof outputs through efficient delivery systems; (iv) allows partnerships with service providers for \naccess to a wider range of competent and reputed expertise; and (v) provides sector assessment, \npolicy support, and knowledge sharing.  \n \n12.  The TA facility will engage an international consulting firm across multiple projects and \nrelated assignments. This modality demonstrates economies of scale in service delivery and \ncontributes to enhanced value-for-money by reducing repetitive transaction costs and eliminating \nthe need for relationship-building with each individual firm appointed under typical standalone, \nproject-specific TAs. The adoption of a TA facility with a single consulting firm as delivery partner \nwill bring consistency, cost effectiveness, and efficiency in the preparation of SEUW\u2019s investment \nprojects. The TA facility will incorporate the lessons learned from the implementation of SURF.6 \nIn managing the service providers, there will be a focus on the consistency and quality of services \ndelivered. The consulting firm\u2019s work will be assessed during and at the end of each task order, \nallowing for improvement and corrective action. If necessary, an additional consulting firm (or \nfirms) may be recruited to supplement or replace the one initially recruited. \n  \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Implementation readiness of resilient urban services projects enhanced. \nThe TA facility will support the development of integrated solutions to prepare ensuing investment \nprojects.7 It will support technical assessment and due diligence, and will support SEUW activities \non (i) development of innovative design approaches; (ii) cross-cutting climate assessments, \nincluding  potential  for  robust  climate-proofing  interventions;8  (iii)  improving  the  enabling \nenvironment (policy and regulatory frameworks, institutional reforms, planning and financing \nsystems); (iv) sector assessments, diagnostics, and master planning; (v) cross-cutting gender \nactivities that facilitate equitable access to and participation in project-related decision making; \n(vi) economic analyses; (vii) financial management assessments and financial analyses; (viii) \nsocial  development  and  gender  assessments including monitoring  of  action  plans;  (ix)  risk \nassessments  and  development  and/or  monitoring  of  risk  management  plans;  (x)  credit \nassessment and review of municipal and sub-sovereign entities; and (xi) safeguards due diligence \nto enhance safeguards outcomes and to mitigate adverse impacts from project interventions as \nfar as reasonably practicable. Gender perspectives will be promoted to include women, girls, and \nother marginalized groups in key elements of project decision making. The TA facility will also \nsupport ongoing country-level initiatives with civil society. \n \n \n5   ADB. 2018. Southeast Asia Urban Services Facility. Manila. \n6  Lessons learned include improving consulting recruitment and contract administration, such as including the \nrequirements for defining and retaining key specialists and streamlining and simplifying task order preparation. In \naddition, the importance of fielding a strong and experienced national team will be emphasized under implementation \nof the TA facility. The management of the consulting firm will build on lessons from SURF where frequent monitoring \nof performance will be adopted to ensure consistent quality outputs.  \n7  Detailed engineering designs are not eligible expenditures for TASF financing and will not be accommodated with \nthe TA facility\u2019s current financing plan. Should the need arise, additional funds via cofinancing will be secured for \ndetailed engineering designs. \n8   It is intended to attract potential climate cofinancing resources to projects supporting low-carbon and climate-resilient \ninitiatives. \n ", "4   \n14.  The TA facility will also seek to enhance financial sustainability of ensuing loan projects. \nThe TA facility will promote engagement with the private sector and leverage existing ADB \ninitiatives that focus on project preparation to attract private sector participation.  It will also explore \nincorporation of advanced technologies in project design which are appropriate to local conditions. \n \n15.  Output 2: Capacity in project implementation and resilient urban services delivery \nimproved. Capacity building in SEA countries will include project administration oversight, and \nsupport in establishing inclusive design standards, policy, and regulatory frameworks. Assistance \nwill be provided in specific fields of expertise, including (i) technical expertise in advanced \ntechnology in core urban services; (ii) developing operation and maintenance (O&M) programs \nand strategies; (iii) addressing climate change by tackling resilience in a holistic, cross-cutting \nmanner and avoiding formulaic \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d, and adopting industry recognized tools where \nappropriate;  (iv) social,  gender,  and  environment safeguard  monitoring;  and  (v)  developing \ninclusive recruitment and employment opportunities at all levels.  \n \n16.  Output 3: Knowledge management and sharing good practices promoted.9 The TA \nfacility will support knowledge management and sharing among SEA countries through training, \nworkshops, and conferences at both regional and national levels.  The TA facility will also support \nthe preparation of knowledge products. The TA facility will help promote close collaboration with \nADB\u2019s urban, water, and health sector groups, and ADB\u2019s environment, gender, and other \nthematic groups to collect and disseminate appropriate lessons to SEA countries and beyond. \nThe TA facility will also support peer-to-peer learning through twinning arrangements between \nappropriate  DMC  urban  services  entities  and  selected  mentors.  This  will  focus  on  sound \noperational best practice to enhance resilience in service providers and where appropriate the \nuse of industry recognized tools to improve O&M and asset management. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $3.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1.5 million from TASF-7 and $2.0 million from TASF-\nother sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The TA facility scope is \nexpected to be expanded to cover other additional activities, and the TA facility will be replenished \nfrom time to time as funds are required and as additional projects in SEUW\u2019s pipeline are \nidentified. During implementation of the TA facility, additional financing requirements will be \nidentified, and additional funds will be sourced on an incremental basis. The governments will \nprovide counterpart support and other in-kind contributions.10  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB is the executing agency for the TA facility and will administer and implement the TA \nfacility through SEUW. Output 1 activities for any ensuing project will commence only after ADB \napproves the project concept paper of the ensuing project. Other activities may commence upon \nTA facility approval. The TA facility will be implemented from August 2021 to August 2024. \n \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \n \n9   All relevant reports produced under this output will be published digitally. \n10  Each government will be informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  August 2021\u2013August 2024 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  SEUW \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \n  Firm: QCBS (80:20)  Facility consultant  $2.8 million \n  Individual: Individual  International and  $0.3 million \nselectiona  national expertise \nAdvance contracting  Consulting contracts are proposed for advance contracting. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time \nto time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Fixed asset turnover and disposal arrangement upon TA completion \narrangement upon TA  follow the provisions in the relevant staff instructions on ADB \ncompletion  administered procurement of goods. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, SEUW = Southeast Asia Urban \nDevelopment and Water Division, TA = technical assistance. \na It is anticipated that, during implementation, requirements for specific and specialized technical expertise will arise. \nTo respond to these needs efficiently and effectively, the TRTA facility requires services of individual consultants who \nwill deliver specialized technical inputs outside of the scope of the consulting firm. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instruction \nand/or staff instructions.11 Survey and other support services will be acquired by the consultant \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nstaff instructions.  \n \nE.  Governance  \n \n21.  ADB is the executing agency, and thus the financial management, procurement, and \nintegrity risks during implementation are assessed to be low. However, the TA will conduct \nthorough risk assessments of these governance areas for ensuing investment projects. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Southeast Asia Facility for Resilient Cities, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n \n11  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1     \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2018000) \nItem  Amount \n \nA.
