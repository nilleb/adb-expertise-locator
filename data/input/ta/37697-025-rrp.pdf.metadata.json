THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nloans to Mongolia for the Darkhan Wastewater Management Project. The report also describes \nproposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Urban Environmental \nInfrastructure Fund1 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility for the Darkhan Urban \nUtility Institutional Improvement Action Plan, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.2 \n \n2.  The project will support environmentally sustainable urban development and better living \nstandards  in  Darkhan  soum  (district),  Mongolia.  It  will  improve  the  city\u2019s  wastewater \nmanagement infrastructure and service delivery through (i) a modern wastewater treatment \nplant (WWTP), (ii) a more efficient sewer system and pumping stations, and (iii) institutional \ncapacity development and policy dialogue. The project will promote poverty alleviation in a city \nwith 27.0% poverty incidence and contribute to a more balanced national urban system and \nstronger urban\u2013rural relationships by supporting urban and industrial development of a second-\ntier city in Mongolia. It will help improve cross-border water quality management and the water \nquality of the Kharaa River, which drains into Lake Baikal in the Russian Federation.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Darkhan-Uul  aimag  (province)  is  Mongolia\u2019s  third-largest  province  with  a  registered \npopulation  of  92,000  and  an  urban  population  in  Darkhan  soum  of  76,400,4 of  which  an \nestimated 40.0% live in ger (traditional tent) areas.5 Darkhan is located 220 kilometers (km) \nnorth of Ulaanbaatar and 130 km south of the border with the Russian Federation. Darkhan \nenjoys favorable conditions for farming and is rich in mineral deposits. It was founded as an \nindustrial  hub  in  1961,  and  benefits  from  the  Trans-Mongolian  rail  line  and  an  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-supported road that connects Ulaanbaatar with Darkhan and the \nLake Baikal region.6 Few industrial investments were made in recent years. Darkhan-Uul\u2019s gross \ndomestic product doubled between 2010 and 2013 and it is becoming an urban economy\u2014the \nservice sector grew from 29.4% to 41.9% of gross domestic product during that period. In 2012, \nto strengthen development of second-tier cities and to mitigate migration to Ulaanbaatar, where \nalmost half the country\u2019s population resides, the government decided for Darkhan to become a \nnational model city for urban sustainability and livability with a vision of becoming a \u201csmart and \ngreen city\u201d by 2028. An urban development master plan for Darkhan is under preparation. The \ngovernment plan for Darkhan includes improvements of existing urban districts and ger areas, \nurban expansion in the form of new industrial and residential areas, strengthened academic \ninstitutions, expanded and new public parks, and environmental protection zones. By 2020, the \nregistered population in Darkhan soum is estimated to grow to 83,000, with 75.0% of the \npopulation  living  in  formalized  and  fully  serviced  residential  districts.  These  industrial  and \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Sweden. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3 Funding of consultant services for project preparation in the amount of $200,000 under the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility was approved on 17 July 2013 (WFMFDC00100-MON), and administered by ADB. \n4  An additional transient population accounts for approximately 8,000, which is being added for calculations. \n5  Based on Darkhan Land Administration Office estimates. \n6  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to Mongolia for the Roads Development Project. Manila (Loan 1364-MON supported road \nimprovements of the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Altanbulag road connecting key economic centers and the three largest cities of \nMongolia\u2014Ulaanbaatar, Erdenet, and Darkhan). ", "2 \nresidential developments will increase demand for urban services, including water supply and \nwastewater  treatment.  Investment  in  infrastructure  is  needed  to  meet  present  and  future \ndemand from improved and expanded services, and to support clustering of new businesses \nand industries.  \n \n4.  The city\u2019s WWTP, and the sanitary sewer system and pumping stations were built in \n1965, and degraded despite partial expansion in 1987.7 They are in urgent need of structural \nrehabilitation or replacement. The WWTP was significantly overdesigned with a capacity of \n50,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day) and never fully utilized. It operates at 8,000 m3/day\u2013\n10,000 m3/day (summer and winter) with peak flows of 15,000 m3/day. Many components are \nunderutilized or unused and dilapidated. Even operating units are in need of serious repair. Of \nthe total 223 km of sewer pipes, 65.0% were built in 1965, and since 2010 domestic funding has \nfinanced some sewer rehabilitation. Three sewer sections and two pumping stations are in \nserious need of replacement or repair and critical for system functionality. Sanitation in ger \nareas currently comes in the form of on-plot pit latrines, which cause soil and groundwater \npollution. Wastewater is not currently collected in ger areas. Plans for incremental extension of \nthe sewer network into ger areas have been prepared for government financing.8 The WWTP \ntreats domestic sewage along with nontoxic industrial wastewater. Industrial pretreatment plants \nremove toxic elements (e.g., from sheepskin processing). A slight temperature and precipitation \nincrease is expected due to climate change. The frequency of droughts and floods, and the \nresulting variability of the Kharaa River\u2019s water flow, is projected to increase.9 Breakdowns of \nthe current domestic and industrial wastewater collection and treatment system cause untreated \nwater to discharge into the groundwater and the Kharaa River. The existing WWTP will further \ndeteriorate rapidly and soon fail\u2014the remaining life of the facility has been estimated at just \n2 years. Moreover, planned and anticipated urban and industrial growth cannot be served by the \nexisting system. \n \n5.  The project will improve the wastewater collection and treatment system and ensure \ncontinuous treatment throughout implementation. The project will directly benefit more than \n45,000 residents (around 60.0% of the urban population) currently connected to the sanitary \nsewer system and, indirectly, more than 76,400 residents. Once in operation, it is anticipated \nthat planned developments and a further expanded sewer system will increase the beneficiary \npopulation to 62,000 residents (around 75.0% of the urban population) connected to the system \nby 2020. The project will support improvement of the city\u2019s wastewater management, its central \nWWTP, sewer system, and pumping stations. It will also support institutional development, \ntraining, project management, and policy dialogue. \n \n6.  The project was requested by the Government of Mongolia for ADB consideration.10 It is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia and is aligned \nwith the interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia.11 With its objective to \ncontribute to inclusive economic and environmentally sustainable growth, the project is aligned \n                                                \n7  Darkhan has a sanitary sewer system that collects domestic and industrial wastewater. Runoff from precipitation is \ncollected separately in drainage channels. The sewer pipes will be extended under newly planned and built roads. \n8  Studies to improve the water and wastewater management systems by a German Government funded technical \nassistance \u201cMoMo\u201d and by the Cities Development Initiative for Asia have been considered. \n9  The Kharaa River basin has a dry winter continental climate with a current annual mean temperature of around 0\u00b0C \nand mean precipitation of 320 millimeters.

The  project  is  aligned  with  the  Government  Action  Plan,  2012\u20132016,  including  its \nobjectives of improving centralized wastewater systems in aimag centers, enforcing the Law on \nWater  Supply  and  Sewer  Use,  and  supporting  the  expansion  of  industrial  development  in \nDarkhan soum. Lessons learned from previous urban and water sector projects in Mongolia \ninclude the selection of adequate wastewater treatment technology tested in cold climates, and \nmanagement of contractor accountability by selecting the plant: design, supply, and install \nprocurement modality for the WWTP to minimize risks of delay, mismatch of structure and \nequipment,  and  failure  during  operations.  The  project  supports  the  sustainability  of  and \ncomplements previous ADB assistance to Darkhan.13 To structurally rehabilitate and retrofit an \nexisting WWTP will be a demonstration feature and serve as a model for other cities in the \nregion with comparable conditions. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  project  impact  will  be  better  living  conditions  and  an  improved environment  in \nDarkhan soum and the Kharaa River basin. The project outcome will be improved system of \nwastewater collection and treatment for domestic and industrial users in Darkhan soum. \n \nC.  Outputs \n8.  Output 1: Improved wastewater treatment plant. The project will establish a modern \nWWTP in Darkhan by renovating those components of the existing facility that are structurally \nsound,  constructing  on-site  the  required  new  components,  and  installing  new  equipment \nthroughout the facility. A new, effective, and energy-efficient treatment process will be adopted, \nsuitable for the cold climate and meeting national and international effluent standards. The base \noperating capacity will be 16,000 m3/day with a peak capacity of 24,000 m3/day. \n \n9.  Output 2: Rehabilitated pumping stations and sewer pipes. The project will improve \nthe wastewater collection system by replacing 1,800 meters of dilapidated sewer pipes and \ncomplementing earlier investment programs of sewer network rehabilitation by the government. \nTwo existing pumping stations will be structurally renovated and fully and newly equipped, \nensuring delivery of the wastewater to the treatment plant at higher energy efficiency. \n \n10.  Output 3: Project management support and capacity development. The project will \n(i) provide expert support for project management, institutional enhancement, and capacity \ndevelopment in utility management, operation, and service provision; emergency preparedness \nand response; and detailed technical design and construction supervision; and (ii) strengthen \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2014.

The  project  is  technically  feasible  based  on  detailed  technical  assessment  and \nevaluation of wastewater management systems in extremely cold climate conditions around the \nworld and in Mongolia with temperature drops to \u201340oC, as well as on detailed analysis of the \nlocal  conditions  and  existing  facilities  and  structures.  The  proposed  wastewater  treatment \ntechnology has been subjected to intensive scrutiny and analysis, resulting in a short list of \ntechnology choices most appropriate for operation in Darkhan. A three-stage process was \nadopted to evaluate alternative wastewater treatment solutions and select the best and lowest-\npossible cost solution. The evaluation concluded that the structural rehabilitation of the existing \ntreatment plant, retrofitted with a new treatment process (a modified activated sludge process \nusing  new  equipment  and  technology),  is  the  lowest-possible  cost  option  and  will  provide \ntreatment quality that will be at least as good as the other considered options. The selected \ntechnology  is  called  integrated  fixed-film  activated  sludge.  Measures  to  mitigate  possible \n                                                \n19 Financing partner: the Government of Sweden. \n20 Funding of the capacity development TA for the Darkhan Urban Utility Institutional Improvement Action Plan was \napproved by the Urban Financing Partnership Facility Steering Committee on 25 August 2014. \n ", "7 \noperational and lifetime risks will be implemented, including (i) ensuring that the WWTP can be \noperated throughout the entire reconstruction process while meeting treatment standards; and \n(ii) managing possible cost increases, because the level of rehabilitation of existing structures \ncannot  be  fully  evaluated  until  the  facility  is  empty.  A  thorough  phasing  plan  to  ensure \ncontinuous treatment and two independent studies by structural engineering units were carried \nout to manage these issues. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  Economic  analysis. The economic analysis examined the economic viability of the \nproject. The project is expected to generate economic benefits from (i) better urban quality of life \nthrough reduced health risks from waterborne diseases, (ii) improved water quality and aquatic \nbiodiversity  of  the  Kharaa  River,  and  (iii)  preparedness  for  wastewater  management \ninfrastructure  expansion  into  the  growing  urban  and  industrial  areas.  The  without-project \nscenario will be loss of wastewater treatment within 2 years. Evaluation of various technology \noptions and layouts confirmed that the selected project is the least-cost option. The economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  base  case  is  13.7%;  tests  for  sensitivity  to  capital \ninvestment, and operation and maintenance (O&M) cost overruns confirm economic viability \nwith EIRRs of 12.0% and 12.4%, respectively. However, a decrease in benefits and a delay in \nimplementation by 1 year result in EIRRs of 10.5% and 10.3%, slightly below the economic \nopportunity cost of capital. Project economic benefits are quantified based on willingness to pay \nfor  improved  wastewater management  service using  the  contingent  valuation  method. The \nbenefit  streams from  incremental  and  nonincremental  wastewater  treated  by  the  proposed \nWWTP are compared with cost streams that include capital investment and O&M costs to \ndetermine the discounted net cash flows and the resulting EIRR. Additional benefits such as \npublic health, environmental improvement, and attractiveness for investments are not quantified.  \n \n19.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis confirmed that the project is financially viable \nbased on assumptions of a slight increase in water and wastewater tariffs, improved technical \nand managerial efficiencies, improved billing, and incremental growth and expansion of the \nclient base. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 3.1% for the base case against the \nweighted average cost of capital calculated at 1.4%. Sensitivity tests evaluated the effects of \nadverse financial conditions on project financial viability. Increases in capital and O&M costs \nresult in FIRRs of 2.3% (both), a reduction in revenue results in a FIRR of 1.5%, and a 1-year \ndelay incurs a FIRR of 1.9%, all above the weighted average cost of capital. Subsidies may be \nneeded in certain years and are guaranteed by DAG, should any financial shortfall occur during \nthe  O&M  phase.  The  affordability  analysis  confirms  that  the  proposed  tariffs  are  within \nwillingness to pay and affordability limits, including for the poor. \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  The MRTCUD and DAG have extensive experience in cooperation and management of \nprojects financed by multilateral and bilateral institutions such as ADB, German development \ncooperation  through  GIZ,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  United  States \nAgency for International Development, and the World Bank. The lessons from implementing and \nmanaging ADB-financed projects will be passed on to the PMU under the MRTCUD and the PIU \nunder DAG. Special emphasis will be given to the procurement capacity by engaging qualified \nspecialists  for  the  PMU  and  PIU,  and  the  provision  of  training  at  the  onset  of  project \nimplementation  by  the  loan  implementation  consultants  engaged  under  output 3.  Project \nfinancial management will be carried out by the PMU and PIU for implementation-related funds \nflow management with final approval by the Ministry of Finance. The DAG as end borrower and \n ", "8 \nDUS as operating unit have reasonable financial management capacity and the weaknesses \nidentified in the financial management assessment will be overcome by engaging financial \nspecialists  for  the  PMU  and  PIU,  and  through  training  and  financial  management  support \nprovided by the loan implementation consultants. These arrangements are deemed adequate. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and agencies concerned during project preparation, including the Ministry \nof Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, MRTCUD, DAG, and DUS. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Poverty incidence in Darkhan is significant at 27% citywide and 44% in ger areas. It \nreflects a high unemployment rate of 14.3% (compared with a national average of 8.2%), \nimmigration of rural poor, and expansion of unserviced ger areas. Lack of wastewater treatment \nresults  in  unsanitary  living  conditions  and  limited  interest  to  invest  in  Darkhan  due  to \nunderdeveloped conditions. The project will directly benefit 12,153 households in the apartment \nareas,  and  1,699  public  and  private  entities  currently  connected  to  the  sewer  system  in \nDarkhan. Indirect beneficiaries of the project are all residents of Darkhan soum (more than \n76,400 persons) who will benefit from the project through (i) an increase in business activities \nand job creation in Darkhan soum, (ii) better sanitary and health conditions, and (iii) a healthier \nurban and river environment. The project will improve treatment and management of domestic \nand industrial wastewater in Darkhan soum, and will create direct short-term employment in \nconstruction  and  indirect  long-term  income-generating  opportunities,  including  industrial \ndevelopment in Darkhan. It will benefit the poor and vulnerable households in the apartment \narea by improving their health conditions and reducing their health-care expenditure, which now \naccrues from illness caused by poor water quality and unsanitary environment conditions. Under \nthe project, the population, especially the poor and women, will participate in the improvement \nprocess for the city\u2019s public services. It is estimated that 70 jobs (40 skilled, 30 unskilled) will be \ncreated, and that most unskilled jobs will be provided to local people, including the poor, and at \nleast 30.0% will be for women. The implementing agency will ensure that Mongolian labor laws \nand the core labor standards are followed. Specific measures to ensure the poverty and social \nbenefits are in the social action plan (SAP) within the PAM (footnote 16). \n \n23.  A SAP was prepared to ensure continued consultation and participation of the local \ncommunity during project implementation. Actions include (i) public awareness program on \nsanitation  and  public  health  issues;  (ii)  public  hearing  on  wastewater  tariff  increases;  and \n(iii) targets  for  employment  of  local  men,  women,  and  the  poor  during  construction  and \noperation.  Implementation  will  be  monitored  through  the  project  performance  management \nsystem, project progress reports, and ADB missions. \n \n24.  Gender. The project is classified as some gender elements, so no gender action plan \nhas been developed. The SAP includes activities that are targeted at both men and women. As \nfor women, the project will (i) ensure their participation in the public awareness campaign on the \nimportance of the project and training on maintaining sanitation facilities properly (40.0% of \nparticipants), (ii) ensure their participation in tariff increase consultations (40.0% of participants), \nand (iii) provide employment opportunities for them during construction. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  Environment. The project is classified as category B for environment since it is not \n ", "9 \nexpected to have unprecedented or irreversible impacts on the environment. A draft initial \nenvironmental examination, including an environmental management plan, has been prepared \nin  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the  Government  of  Mongolia\u2019s \nregulatory framework. Short-term impacts are anticipated during construction, including dust \nand noise generated during sewer-line replacement work, and inappropriate solid and liquid \nwaste  management  at  construction  sites,  which  could  pollute  the  Kharaa  River.  Mitigation \nmeasures have been defined in the environmental management plan to reduce these impacts to \nacceptable levels. During construction, continuous wastewater treatment will be maintained at \ncurrent  levels.  During  operation,  no  significant  environmental  impact  is  anticipated.  O&M \ntraining and monitoring of treatment performance will minimize operational impacts and risks. \nThe project will have substantial environmental and socioeconomic benefits. By strengthening \nDarkhan\u2019s municipal wastewater collection and treatment capacity it will provide protection of \nand improvement to Kharaa River's water environment. 21 The project's climate risk is medium. \nThe projected increase in average and peak precipitation, and the related risk of more urban \nstormwater  runoff,  will  be  adequately  managed  with  separate  wastewater  and  stormwater \ncollection systems. \n \n26.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement because it will not have significant LAR impacts. No residential land or structures \nwill be affected by the project. A resettlement plan was prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and endorsed by DAG and the MRTCUD, disclosed to the affected persons, \nand uploaded on ADB\u2019s website on 12 August 2014. Eight entities will be affected, i.e., two \nsmall enterprises, three commercial entities, and three state budget institutions. Five affected \nentities will lose a total of 2,711.1 square meters of land. All losses are partial. State institutions \nand private companies own the land. Fences and gates of three entities with a total length of \n112 meters will be affected. Other affected structures include entrance stairs to two shops, a \nspeed  bump,  and  a  billboard.  Two  businesses  will  experience  a  temporary  impact. \nCompensation for lost assets and resettlement allowances will be paid to affected persons. The \nPMU under the MRTCUD is responsible for all management, communication, and coordination \nwork  during  project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  PIU  under  DAG  has  overall \nresponsibility for LAR. This includes preparation, implementation, financing, and interagency \ncoordination of all related tasks. The MRTCUD is experienced in implementing ADB-funded and \nLAR activities. The loan implementation resettlement consultant will provide training and support \nto the PMU and PIU to ensure smooth implementation. A grievance redress mechanism will be \nestablished, and the PIU will conduct semiannual monitoring and evaluation of resettlement plan \nimplementation, assisted by the loan implementation resettlement consultant. DAG confirmed \nthat all funds for involuntary resettlement compensation will be available on time. \n \n27.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous people. No \nspecific communities of ethnic minorities or groups are living in concentrated areas and no \nadverse impacts are expected. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.22  \n                                                \n21 The WWTP will remove significant amounts of pollutants that would otherwise be discharged into the Kharaa River, \nincluding chemical oxygen demand (3,000 tons per year), biological oxygen demand (1,700 tons per year), \nnitrogen (330 tons per year), and phosphorous (42 tons per year). \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPublic financial management  DAG\u2019s financial reporting systems will be upgraded with support from the PIU and \nissues, weak fund-flow  loan implementation consultants to enable DAG to track project proceeds from \nmanagement, and little  sources and payments to final beneficiaries. Consulting services during \ncapacity to manage foreign  implementation will assist with public financial management, fund-flow support, and \nexchange risks  audit reporting. \nInefficient procurement and  Procurement specialists will be recruited for the PMU and PIU, and consultants will \ncorruption risk  provide training before procurement starts and bridge gaps that may impede project \neffectiveness. Relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) are included in the loan documents and will be part of the bidding documents. \nThe MRTCUD will annually disclose the status of the use of project proceeds. \nDAG project implementation  Consultants will (i) provide training and support, including financial management, \ncapacity is limited and may  project and contract management, and performance monitoring and reporting; and \ncause delays  (ii) review and guide optimization of design, equipment specification, and operation. \nUnforeseen flow rates and  DAG and DUS capacity to enforce national discharge standards for industries \ncomposition of wastewater  discharging effluent into public sewers will be strengthened. Emergency monitoring, \ncompromise treatment  early warning, and response systems will be developed.

ASSURANCES \n29.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n30.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n31.
