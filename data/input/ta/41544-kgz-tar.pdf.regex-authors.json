The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  to  prepare  the  Investment  Climate \nImprovement Program. The PPTA is included in the joint country support strategy 2007\u20132010.1\nDuring  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  November  2007,  ADB  and  the  Government  reached  an \nunderstanding  on  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  objectives,  scope  and  implementation \narrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2\nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  As a small landlocked country with a population of about 5 million and limited natural \nresources, the Kyrgyz Republic faces formidable development challenges. Averaging 4% per \nyear during 2000\u20132006, gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been modest and volatile. \nApproximately 40% of the population lives below the poverty line, and 9% in extreme poverty. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s longer-term economic prospects hinge on improving productivity and \ncompetitiveness by putting in place efficient market mechanisms and a dynamic private sector. \nHowever,  the  private  sector  continues  to  face  a  hostile  environment  characterized  by  an \nexcessive  regulatory  burden,  weaknesses  in  enforcing  property  rights  and  contracts,  and \ninfrastructure bottlenecks.3 The World Bank's Doing Business 20084 report ranked the Kyrgyz \nRepublic 94th out of 178 countries for \"ease of doing business.\"  \n3. High  Regulatory  Burden,  Administrative  Barriers,  and  Red  Tape.    Business\nlicensing and permit procedures are onerous, requiring numerous and overlapping documents \nfrom several agencies. There are 34 broad categories of activities requiring licenses from \n16 ministries and 14 agencies.  According to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2008 report, \nthere are 20 different procedures required, and businesses can spend as many as 291 days \ndealing with license-related matters.  As a result, in the category \u201cdealing with licenses\u201d, the \nKyrgyz Republic ranks 152 out of the 178 countries surveyed. There has recently been a \nproliferation of government inspections and certification requirements and related fees and fines, \ndisrupting  business  operations  and  adding  significantly  to  the  regulatory  burden.    While \nprogress has been made in streamlining customs procedures, businesses continue to face \nsignificant  administrative  barriers  because  of  unharmonized  regulations  and  a  lack  of \ninformation  sharing  among  trade-regulating  agencies  such  as  customs,  border  control \nauthorities,  and  health  and  veterinary  inspectors.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  reduce \nadministrative barriers and red tape through legal, institutional, regulatory, and administrative \nreforms. Adoption of effective information and communication technology (ICT) is essential if \nthese  reforms  are  to  succeed.  The  many  institutions  and  the  prevalence  of  paper-based \nsystems  have  stifled  business  development  by  increasing  regulatory  arbitrage  between \ninstitutions and the scope for rent-seeking. Specifically, ICT tools could improve transparency, \nattract investments, and support business development by making government agencies more \nresponsive  and  accountable  to  the  needs  of  the  private  sector.  Possible  institutional \narrangements  include  the  organization  of  a  one-stop-shop  for  business  licensing  and \nregistration, and a single electronic window for export and import procedures. \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2007.  Joint Country Support Strategy (2007\u20132010):  Kyrgyz Republic.  Manila.  The joint country support \nstrategy was prepared by ADB, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, Swiss \nCooperation, United Nations agencies, and the World Bank Group. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 January 2008. \n3   A basic problem tree analysis is presented in Appendix 2. \n4   World Bank. 2008.  Doing Business 2008.  Washington DC.", "2\n4.  Weak  Legal  Environment.  A  strong  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  ensuring \nproperty rights and contract enforcement is a prerequisite for private sector development. Land \nownership rights remain weak, mainly because of inconsistencies in the laws and procedures \nfor the sale and purchase of land. Private investment is also deterred by inadequate safeguards \non the enforcement of property and contractual rights. Court procedures for commercial dispute \nresolution  are  time-consuming,  inefficient,  and  costly.  Judges  lack  adequate  knowledge  of \ncommercial practices and business needs. Use of out-of-court arbitration has been limited by \nweak implementation capacity and lack of public awareness and confidence. \n5.  Recent amendments to the Pledge Law have simplified collateral requirements and \nintroduced out-of-court procedures for asset foreclosure upon default. However, remaining legal \nambiguities and lack of enforcement mechanisms mean commercial banks typically cannot \navoid court procedures. Court decisions and their execution can take up to 1 year, and longer if \nthe borrower appeals the court decision. Moreover, there are legal restrictions on the sale of \nsecured  assets.  Limited  coverage  and  inadequate  information  from  the  credit  information \nbureau5 hinder banks' assessments of potential borrowers' creditworthiness.  Combined, these \nfactors increase credit risk and the cost of borrowing, and deter investment. \n6.  Low Skills Base and Inadequate Financing Modalities. Improving productivity and \nexpanding  the  private  sector's  growth  potential  will  require  investment  in  market-oriented \nentrepreneurship skills. Most businesses lack the technical and entrepreneurial skills that would \nenable them to produce higher value-added products and expand in domestic and overseas \nmarkets. As a result, they continue to operate at low levels of efficiency and do not create \nenough jobs. The implications of the large and growing outflow of migrant workers, most of \nwhom have secondary or higher education, need to be addressed. More generally, technical \nand entrepreneurial skills are needed to expand the country's economic base and to realize the \nconsiderable potential for the development of agri-business in food, cash crops and horticulture \nprocessing, and inputs for light industry. High value-added production by small and medium-\nsized enterprises is also constrained by the lack of funds for capital investment. Efforts to \nimprove access to finance will therefore need to be supplemented by measures to expand \nfinancing modalities, including leasing, for small and medium-sized enterprises. \n7. Absence of a Policy and Regulatory Basis for Public\u2013Private Partnerships.6 State \nownership is dominant in what the authorities define as strategic industries, including almost all \nof the infrastructure sectors and the larger manufacturing enterprises.  Limited or no investment, \nand  generally  poor  management  of  these  enterprises  have  led  to  frequent  shortages  and \nbottlenecks,  hindering  the  efficient  functioning  of  markets  and  development  of  services \nsupporting market-based production and distribution. While full privatization may be politically \nand  technically  difficult  in  the  short  term,  the  scope  for  improving  state-owned  industries\u2019 \ncommercial viability and service provision through public\u2013private partnership (PPP) needs to be \nanalyzed.  However, the legal basis for PPP is not clear and new legislation and amendments to \n                                                \n5  The Credit Information Bureau Ishenim is operated by the Association of Financial-Credit Organizations.  \n6\nPPPs are contractual arrangements between the public sector and a private sector party for the private delivery of \npublic  infrastructure  and  social  services.  In  infrastructure,  they  can  include  service  contracts,  management \ncontracts,  leases,  concessions,  divestiture  and  build\u2013own\u2013operate  contracts,  and  frequently  involve \ncomplementary investments and/or services. Examples include private investments in power generation that are \ncomplemented by public investments in power transmission and distribution; involvement of a strategic private \ninvestor in the implementation and operation of a gas transmission project undertaken by the state gas corporation; \nimplementation of a network of feeder roads or provision of land by the public sector to supplement a privately \nfinanced and operated toll road; in airports, provision of facilities such as runways and aprons by the public sector \nwith private investors providing other facilities (such as terminals and their operation); and provision of port \ninfrastructure by the public sector with a private investor being awarded a concession for port operation.", "3\nexisting laws (such as the laws on procurement and concession) are required.7 The feasibility of \npiloting PPP in specific sectors needs to be assessed, and appropriate ownership and financing \nmodels, including concessions and performance maintenance contracting arrangements, need \nto be established. \n8. Weak Institutional Arrangements. Reforms thus far have generally been introduced in \nan ad hoc and piecemeal manner. On numerous occasions, legal and regulatory reforms have \ncontradicted existing legislation and policies, exacerbating the uncertainty and risks faced by \nbusinesses. Various government agencies, including the Ministry of Economic Development \nand Trade, the Ministry of Finance, and line ministries, currently have responsibilities over \ndifferent aspects of private sector development. Quasi-government and consultative bodies with \ninvestment  promotion  and  private  sector  development  mandates  have  also  proliferated.8\nUnclear  and  overlapping  roles  undermine  transparency  and  accountability.  Identifying  an \nappropriate lead agency and establishing effective interagency coordination mechanisms will \ntherefore  be  a  first  step  in  the  reform  process.  The  lead  agency  will  be  responsible  for \nformulating and adopting a comprehensive private sector strategy, leading consultations with \nbusinesses to assess evolving needs and priorities, and coordinating with relevant entities to \nmonitor and evaluate implementation.\n9.   Government  Priorities  and  Support  from  Development  Partners.  Improving the \ninvestment climate and reducing bureaucratic red tape is highlighted as a priority in the country \ndevelopment strategy 2007\u20132010 developed in close consultation with the private sector and \nother stakeholders.  A key recent milestone was the enactment of the Law on Inspection in \nMarch 2007. Prepared with technical assistance from the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) Business Environment Improvement Project, the law aims to protect \nentrepreneurs from legal ambiguities and unjustifiable inspections and fines. As inspection \nprovisions are  cross-cutting,  changes  to  a  number  of  related  laws  and  regulations  will  be \nneeded  to  make  them  consistent  with  the  Law  on  Inspections.  USAID  is  also  supporting \ndevelopment  of  a  system  of  regulatory  impact  analysis,  which  will  be  a  starting  point  for \nstreamlining the regulatory regime. A presidential decree and government resolutions aimed at \nrationalizing export and import clearance procedures through the establishment of a single \nelectronic  window  have  also  recently  been  issued.    Following  this,  the  Government  has \nprepared a basic concept for the single electronic window with technical assistance from the \nGerman  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ),9 and  has  asked  ADB  to  support  the \nestablishment of a single electronic window. The two main areas of World Bank support include \nthe  establishment  of  a  registry  for  immovable  property,  and  the  streamlining  of  product \nstandards and certification requirements. \n10. ADB Strategy and Operations.  More investment and less corruption in an efficient and \ntransparent business environment are key outcomes envisaged in the joint country support \nstrategy 2007\u20132010. The proposed TA and ensuing program will build on the achievements of \npast  ADB  assistance.  For  instance,  the  Second  Phase  of  the  Corporate  Governance  and \nEnterprise Reform Program10 helped develop the Pledge Law and the legal framework for out-\n                                                \n7  Lin, Cyril. 2007.

Likewise,  measures  to  improve  access  to  finance  will  build  on  the \nachievements of the Financial Intermediation and Resource Mobilization Program11 and the \nongoing  Banking  and  Capital  Market  Development  Program,12 which  were  instrumental  in \nputting in place the legal, regulatory and supervisory framework for the banking and nonbanking \nfinancial  sectors.  ADB  is  also  currently  providing  assistance  for  customs  reform  and  tax \nadministration reform.13 By helping streamline and automate customs and tax administration, \nthese  projects  will  contribute  significantly  to  reducing  administrative  barriers  faced  by \nbusinesses. \n11.  There  is,  therefore,  demonstrated  Government  commitment  and  considerable  donor \nsupport for improving the business environment and investment climate. The challenge is to \nformulate a reform agenda that goes beyond policy pronouncements and enactment of laws and \nregulations, and puts in place the institutional setting, incentive structures, and systems and \nprocedures necessary for effective implementation and enforcement.  Helping the Government \nmeet this challenge will require long-term engagement through a programmatic approach that \nsupports policy reform, as well as investment and capacity-building needs.    \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA aims to support sustainable economic growth through an improved business \nenvironment and investment climate.14  To this end, the TA will develop a medium-term strategy \nand an action plan for addressing the key impediments to private sector development. The \naction plan will cover measures over the short term (1\u20132 years), medium term (2\u20134 years) and \nlong term (4\u20136 years) to reduce the cost of doing business. The measures will aim to gradually \nincrease the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s standing in terms of ease of doing business from 94th place in \nthe World Bank's Doing Business 2008 to about 60th by 2010 and better than 40th by 2013. \nThe  main  TA  outputs  will  include  (i)  analysis  of  the  binding  constraints  to  private  sector \ndevelopment,15 (ii) assessment of technical and vocational training needs for market-oriented \nentrepreneurship, (iii) concrete policy recommendations for improving the business environment \nand investment climate, (iv) design of specific institutional arrangements such as a one-stop-\nshop and a single electronic window for ensuring reform implementation and enforcement, and \n(v) capacity building of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade and other agencies. \nThese outputs will form the building blocks for the design of the proposed program cluster. It is \nenvisaged that the program cluster will be implemented over a 4\u20135 year period. In addition to \n                                                \n11ADB. 1999.

The TA will have two components.  \n(i) Component 1: Situation Analysis and Diagnostics.  This component will start \nwith  a  quick  stocktaking  of  recent  studies  and  assessments,  including  a \ncomprehensive review of the policy, legal and regulatory framework affecting the \nbusiness  environment  and  investment  climate.  The  focus  will  be  on,  among \nothers, business registration and licensing, property rights, commercial dispute \nresolution, access to finance, entrepreneurial skills, and PPPs. The review will \nidentify the binding constraints to investment and private sector development. It \nwill clearly distinguish the impediments resulting from weaknesses in the policy, \nlegal and regulatory framework from those due to lack of awareness and weak \nimplementation capacity. Extensive stakeholder consultations through workshops \nand seminars will be conducted. \n(ii) Component  2:  Reform  Agenda  Formulation.    Based  on  the  findings  of \ncomponent 1, a comprehensive medium-term reform strategy and a time-bound \naction plan will be formulated. The strategy will include blueprints on the use of \nICT to streamline business procedures through the establishment of a one-stop-\nshop for business licensing and a single electronic window for export and import \nprocedures. It will also include a subcomponent on the skills needs for market-\noriented  entrepreneurship.  The  primary  focus  of  this  component  will  be  on \nidentifying concrete and achievable goals and developing an implementation plan \nto ensure reform effectiveness and sustainability. Stakeholder consultation will \nfocus on improving awareness and securing buy-in for the proposed reforms.16\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000 \non a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of \n$100,000 equivalent in-kind by providing office space, logistical support, workshop facilities, and \ncounterpart staff. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 4. The Government has been advised \nthat ADB\u2019s approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade will be the Executing Agency and will \nprovide logistical support, workshop facilities, and counterpart staff. The Minister of Economic \nDevelopment and Trade will chair the TA steering committee, which will include the deputy \nminister of economic development and trade, and representatives from the Ministry of Finance, \nPresidential  Administration,  Prime  Minister's  Office,  State  Committee  on  State  Property \nManagement,  State  Committee  for  Taxes  and  Collections  and  State  Customs  Committee, \nNational Bank of Kyrgyz Republic and the Investment Council. The steering committee will \nguide and assist TA implementation.    \n                                                \n16 The consultations will be in line with ADB. 2006.

It will require about 15 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultant  services  and  15  person-months  of  domestic  consultant \nservices. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 5. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged by ADB on an individual basis, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will prepare an \ninception report within 1 month of TA inception, a midterm report during the 3rd month of \nimplementation, and a draft final report at least 2 weeks before TA completion. The consultants \nwill be responsible for procurement of goods and services required for the TA.  Equipment will \nbe procured through the shopping method according to ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time), and will be transferred to the Ministry of Economic Development \nand Trade upon TA completion.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for preparing the Investment Climate Improvement \nProgram, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Kyrgyz Republic joint country support strategy  2007\u20132010 is closely aligned with the Government's development \ngoals as defined in the country development strategy (CDS) 2007\u20132010, prepared by the Kyrgyz authorities. The CDS builds \non the policy experience gained in implementing the national poverty reduction strategy. The CDS is anchored on four pillars: \n(i) growth-oriented economic development and improving the business environment, (ii) governance and transparency in \npublic  administration,  (iii)  human  resource  development,  and  (iv)  environmental  sustainability  and  natural  resources \nmanagement. The CDS places improving governance high on the agenda. Policies and actions will focus on creating a \nfavorable business environment that supports private sector development and an investment climate that will attract foreign \ninvestment. ADB's assistance program within the joint country support strategy framework includes support for improving the \ninvestment climate that will aim to streamline procedures for registration, licensing and compliance of private businesses; \nlower administrative barriers for businesses; and enforce property and creditor rights.\nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.   Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention (GI)    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2) \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n         The  project  does  not  focus  on  individuals  or  households  or  specific  geographical  areas,  but  aims  to  support \nmacroeconomic growth by improving the business environment to enable increased investment and employment generation. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \nThe project is classified as a general intervention and therefore no full poverty analysis is required.
