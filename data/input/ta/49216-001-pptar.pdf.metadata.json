The  Sri  Lanka  Government\u2019s  sector  development  framework2  envisions  sustainable \ndevelopment of energy resources, enabling access to and use of energy services by the entire \npopulation, and reliable delivery of such services at a competitive price. To increase access to \nelectricity and achieve the goal of meeting the growing demand for electricity at sufficiently low \ncost and acceptable reliability to widen access to growth opportunities and attain sustainability \nin the long term, the government plans to increase supply capacity of the system including \nthrough raising share of renewable energy sources (e.g., hydro, wind, solar, etc.), reducing total \ntechnical and commercial losses of the transmission and distribution networks, and undertaking \nenergy efficiency and conservation measures. To address investment needs in support of these \nplans,  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  needed  to  prepare  a  relevant \ninvestment project for consideration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nMajor Outputs and Activities \n2.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A3.1.  \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \nConducting project technical,  March 2016  Inception Report  October 2015 \neconomic, financial,  Interim Report  January 2016 \ngovernance, resettlement and  Final Report  March 2016 \nenvironmental due diligence  \n       \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The TA will also support an implementing agency in ensuring project readiness. In \naddition to a detailed engineering design and preparation of relevant bidding documents for the \nproposed hybrid renewable energy mini-grid systems in small isolated islands in Sri Lanka being \nundertaken by separate consulting services,3 PPTA consultants will assist the implementing \nagency in finalizing a preliminary detailed design and preparation of procurement packaging and \nbidding documents for medium and low voltage sub-projects to be financed under the project as \npart of advance contracting activities.  \n \nCost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n4.  The ADB will provide US$225,000 equivalent in grant financing from ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The Government of Sri Lanka will provide its counterpart \nsupport in the form of in kind contribution, including office accommodation and support facilities, \n                                                           \n1 Formerly Preparing Rural Electrification. \n2 Government of Sri Lanka, 2008.
