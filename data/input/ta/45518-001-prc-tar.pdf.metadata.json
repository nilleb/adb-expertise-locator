INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the 2010 country programming mission, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nrequested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide technical assistance (TA) to conduct \na study on enhancing the energy regulation system for low-carbon development in the PRC. \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s nonlending program for 2011.1 The concept paper was approved \non 9 November 2011. During the fact-finding mission, understandings were reached with the \nGovernment  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  regarding  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference for \nthe TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  primary  energy  consumption  of  the  PRC  increased  rapidly  from  approximately \n1 billion tons of coal equivalent (tce) in 1990, to 2 billion tce in 2004, and 3 billion tce in 2009. \nSoaring energy demand is both a driver and a consequence of the rapid economic growth in the \nPRC. However, the PRC\u2019s per capita energy consumption is still very low, only about one-third \nof the average of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.2 It is \nexpected  that  in  the  foreseeable  future,  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  demand  and  consumption  will \ncontinue  to  grow.  Some  estimates  show  that  before  2015,  the  PRC\u2019s  primary  energy \nconsumption will exceed 4 billion tce.  \n \n3.  The PRC has grown from being a minor and largely self-sufficient energy consumer to a \nmajor importer. In 2010, it was the second-largest oil importer behind the United States. Of its \napproximately 429 million tons of oil consumption in 2010, 226 million (or more than half) was \nimported.3 Apart from oil, natural gas and coal consumption has also increased rapidly. In 2010, \nthe PRC imported approximately 12 million tons of natural gas and 160 million tons of coal.4 The \nincreasing reliance on the import of fossil fuels is causing concerns for PRC energy security.  \n \n4.  Increased fossil-fuel consumption has also worsened environmental pollution, sharply \nincreasing greenhouse gas emissions and casting serious doubts on the sustainability of the \ncurrent  energy-intensive  economic  growth  pattern.  The  government  has  recognized  that \nsustaining economic growth will not be possible without efforts to remove constraints on energy \nsupply and stop environmental degradation. To promote the development of a modern energy \nindustry, the government has been steadily advancing reforms, including promoting the market-\nbased regulation system and optimizing the low-carbon energy supply mix.  \n \n5.  In the PRC, many national and local government agencies share energy policymaking \nand implementing responsibilities. The National Energy Leading Group of the State Council, \nestablished  in  2005,  is  the  highest  decision-making  body.  The  National  Development  and \nReform  Commission  (NDRC)  and  the  National  Energy  Administration  (NEA),  a  partially \nindependent ministry under the NDRC, are major agencies responsible for formulating energy \nsector development strategies, developing energy policy, and coordinating between ministries. \nIn general, the NEA is responsible for energy supply, while the NDRC takes the lead in energy \nefficiency, energy pricing, and industry regulation. Several other ministries also have important \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 November 2011. \n2  International Energy Agency (IEA). 2010.

The Ministry of Water Resources oversees \nhydropower resources. The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for rural energy development. \nThe Ministry of Finance participates in any reforms involving financial incentives, tax reforms, \nand fees. The State Electricity Regulatory Commission plays a key role in power sector reform \nand electricity market regulation. Finally, the provincial and municipal counterparts of these \nagencies must implement energy policies made by the national government agencies.  \n \n6.  While the PRC's energy regulation system is robust and has served the sector well \nduring its rapid growth, it needs further refinements and harmonization to make the energy \nsector more market-oriented. The energy regulation system has shortcomings that need to be \nrectified. Foremost, it does not involve a comprehensive energy law. It should set out the basic \nprinciples that subsidiary sector laws should follow. It should also define and reorganize, if \nnecessary, the responsibilities of various ministries in relation to energy5 The PRC\u2019s energy \n.\nregulation challenges are largely shaped by its national economic policy goals. Paramount \namong them is the need to sustain its strong economic growth, but in a way that is more \nenvironmentally  sustainable  than  has  so  far  been  the  case.  In  response  to  the  rapid \ndevelopment of the domestic energy market and changes in policy priorities in the Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan, the new energy law has to reflect latest developments in market-based energy \nregulation abroad and adapting them to the PRC\u2019s context.  \n \n7.  Some sector laws and regulations have become outdated and should be revised to \nreflect  the current  market  situation.  For  example,  the  electricity  law  should  be  updated  to \npromote electricity market reform, streamline the investment mechanism, and assist renewable \nenergy integration. The separation of generation from transmission and distribution after 2002 \nenabled introduction of wholesale and retail competition, but how the grids will be regulated has \nyet to be decided. Also, the government has shown increasing willingness to use economic \nlevers to influence energy supply and demand. Decisions about feed-in tariffs for preferred \ntechnologies, particularly those using renewable sources, will affect investments and energy \nsupply mix in the future.  \n \n8.  The rapid rise in energy imports increases demand for international cooperation on \nenergy, which requires a harmonized relationship between domestic energy regulations and \ninternational practices. As in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \ncountries, an emergency oil stock is needed to withstand any disruption in supply of oil. In this \nregard, it is essential to study international practices and their relevance to the PRC. The \noperational mechanism for this emergency stock should also be developed. Transboundary \nissues like hydropower development on international rivers and ocean energy utilization have to \nbe studied. It is critically important that domestic laws and regulations are harmonized with \ninternational laws.  \n \n9.  The existing energy infrastructure in the PRC, along with its regulatory arrangements, \nwas developed for the fossil fuel-based economy and inherited from the previous, centrally \nplanned system. While the PRC is accelerating its market-oriented reforms, there is an urgent \nneed to comprehensively analyze the above-mentioned issues and help the PRC create an \nenabling regulatory environment for energy sector development. The establishment of an open, \ntransparent, and orderly energy regulation system will pave the way for future reforms and the \nrapid and smooth development of the energy sector in the PRC. \n \n                                                 \n5  IEA. 2007.

Sustaining \nstrong economic growth will be vital for poverty reduction and inclusive development. But it will \nnot be possible without ensuring environmental sustainability and security of energy supply. \nRecognizing the close links between economic growth, energy demand, and environmental \nprotection, the PRC has already formulated many reforms to correct the current growth pattern.  \n \n11.  In Strategy 2020,6 ADB has defined energy as a core operational sector and achieving \nenvironmental sustainability as a strategic priority in helping its developing member countries \nreduce poverty and improve living conditions. Its country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nPRC,  which  is  being  finalized,  lists  as  priorities  low-carbon  development,  knowledge  and \nfinancing to catalyze policy, and regulatory reforms to drive innovation. This TA is expected to \nstrengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks in the PRC, promote the utilization of renewable \nenergy and strengthen the market-based regulation system to improve energy intensity, and \nhelp reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is a strong and direct link between this TA and \nADB\u2019s operational priorities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be intensified energy sector reforms to promote low-carbon \ndevelopment. The target of the TA impact will be improvement by 2015 of energy intensity by \n16%, and of carbon intensity by 17%, compared with 2010. The outcome of the TA will be an \nenhanced energy regulation system and stronger institutional capacity in energy policy research. \nThe target of the TA outcome is that the NEA endorses policy recommendations made under \nthe TA in 2013. The TA will help the PRC create a more enabling environment for energy \nmarket mechanisms. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA is expected to deliver the following outputs: \n \n(i)  An integrated study on the PRC\u2019s current energy regulation system and legislation, \nand their adequacy for its future low-carbon transformation.  \n(ii)  Policy recommendations in drafting the energy law and amending the electricity law. \n(iii)  Capacity development and information dissemination. A policy note on main TA \nfindings will be prepared and shared with government officials, and workshops, \nseminars, and conferences will also be organized.  \n \n14.  General consultations have been conducted with the NEA, the Ministry of Finance, and \nother government agencies concerned on the key activities of the TA. During implementation, \nclose coordination will be maintained with stakeholders to ensure that the TA takes into account \nexisting studies, government priorities, and development plans. Experts from research institutes \nand universities will be consulted so as to increase understanding of current practices and find \npragmatic methods for enhancing the energy regulation system. Consultants will be required to \nexamine international best practices and compare lessons learned with the PRC\u2019s economic \nenvironment. The consultants will also be required to maintain close working relations with ADB \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

Tripartite meetings among ADB, the NEA, and the consultants will be held \nperiodically to provide guidance to the consultants and to review their reports.  \n \n15.  The  TA  includes  innovative  ideas  and  approaches,  but  the  associated  risks  are \nconsidered  manageable.  The  key  assumption  for  the  TA  is  that  the  government  remains \ncommitted  to  building  a  market-oriented  energy  sector.  Since  the  TA  is  in  line  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s development plan to maximize environmental sustainability and strengthen its \nmarket-based regulation system to improve energy efficiency, the NEA has good ownership of \nthe  TA.  To  ensure  that  the  designed  outputs  can  be  delivered  on  time,  the  project  team \nextensively discussed the TA outline and key outputs with relevant government officials and \nexperts, while support from the management of the NEA was sought on the TA design.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent.  ADB will provide $400,000 \nequivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other \nsources). The government will provide in-kind contributions in the form of office accommodation, \nlogistics facilities, and remuneration of counterpart staff. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from February 2012 to August 2013. The \nNEA is the proposed executing and implementing agency. The NEA has nominated senior \nofficials  from  its  Department  of  Policies  and  Laws  to  guide  the  TA  formulation  and \nimplementation on a daily basis.  \n \n18.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants with extensive knowledge and \nexpertise in (i) energy development strategy, (ii) energy economics, (iii) energy legislation, \n(iv) electricity reform, and (v) energy-related environmental and social safeguards. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will select and engage consultants \nthrough a consulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time) using the quality- (80%) and cost-based (20%) selection method. \nThe consulting firm will be required to submit a biodata technical proposal covering team \ncomposition,  task  assignments,  work  and  personnel  schedules,  and  CVs  of  proposed \nconsultants.  All  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All equipment purchased under the TA will be \nturned over to the executing agency after TA completion. To ease TA implementation, an \nadvance payment facility is requested, and TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  Activities for capacity development and information dissemination, such as seminars, \nworkshops,  conferences,  and  study  tours,  will  be  finalized  during  TA  implementation  and \nadministered by the executing agency with the support from the consultants. The consultants \nare required to provide capacity building materials, and to summarize and report important \ntopics highlighted at seminars and workshops to the NEA and ADB. The consultants are also \nrequired to submit their reports on time.  All reports should discuss the terms of reference with \ndetails appropriate to the respective stage. Detailed requirements for deliverables and reports \nare included in the outline terms of reference for consultants (Appendix 3).  \n \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.
