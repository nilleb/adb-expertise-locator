Rawalpindi is the third largest city in Pakistan and currently has over 1.5 million people, \nwith about 4% annual growth. About 40% of the city\u2019s population is in the low income group. To \naddress  the  problems  of  scarcity  of  safe  drinking  water  and  poor  drainage,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved a loan of $72 million in 1993 for the Rawalpindi Urban \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project, which forms the first phase of a proposed 3-phase \nprogram for improving the water and sanitation services in Rawalpindi.1 At the completion of the \nfirst phase of the program in 2003, Rawalpindi will have increased water supplies from 192,000 \ncubic meter per day (cmd) to the planned 256,000 cmd, with considerable rehabilitation and \nextension of its water supply distribution network and an improved drainage system. In addition, \nmajor  institutional  and  financial  reforms  have  been  successfully  implemented  and,  the \nengineering studies for the future development of water supplies, sewerage and drainage \nmaster plans, and a solid waste management plan have been prepared under the phase I \nproject. The second phase of the program is conceived to focus on further improvements to \nsewerage  and  drainage,  the  provision  of  a  sewage  treatment  plant,  and  solid  waster \nmanagement. The third phase will complete the overall requirements in Rawalpindi's water and \nsanitation sector.  \n \n 2.  The Government of Pakistan requested ADB in December 2002 for financial assistance \nfor a second phase of the ongoing program. In response, ADB fielded from 15 to 26 February \n2003  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  for  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  The \nMission conducted extensive field visits in the project area in Rawalpindi, met with the officials \nfrom federal and  provincial governments, and with the Rawalpindi District and subdistrict \n(tehsil) governments. Consultative meetings were held with the beneficiary groups, elected \nfemale councilors of Rawalpindi district, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the related \nbilateral agencies. The Mission presented its findings to the government who concurred with the \ngoals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms \nof reference of the consultants for the TA.2 The proposed Project will be in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s Ten Year Perspective Development Plan 2001\u20132011 to improve social services \nin the country and accelerate gains in productivity; reduce poverty; and promote smaller, \nhealthier, and better educated families. ADB's Country Strategy and Program for Pakistan \n(2002\u20132006) reaffirms ADB\u2019s assistance to the government for improving municipal services in \nthe context of devolving municipal functions to local governments, with particular focus on \nservices for the poor. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Lack of Adequate Water Supply. The water supply available to Rawalpindi City does \nnot reach the planned 256,000 cmd  due to the poor yield from Khanpur Dam and decreasing \noutflows from existing tubewells, mainly due to persistent drought over the past 3 years.  The \ncity is expected to face future deficits of about 27% of demand in 2010 and 48% in 2025.3 The \nprojected deficits may be addressed through (i) reducing water loss, which accounts for over \n30% of treated water production, in the mains and distribution network, (ii) introducing water \nconservation measures to reduce demand and (iii) developing new water supply sources.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB.1993. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Pakistan \nfor the Rawalpindi Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project.  Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edtition) on 21 January 2003.  \n3  Rawalpindi Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Projecti, Phase II Concept Report 2002. ", "2 \nRegarding new water sources, the Rawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) and the \nSmall Dams Organization (SDO) have prepared proposals for developing small storage dams \nsurrounding Rawalpindi. Comprehensive technical, economic, and financial studies  of these \nproposals have yet to be undertaken.    \n    \n4.  Poor Water Quality. Water quality analyses done in 20024 showed that over 85% of \nwater samples analyzed for physical, chemical, and bacteriological parameters were found \nunsafe for human consumption due to bacterial contamination. The distribution system is weak \ndue to intermittent water supply, leakage, and ingress of pollution from sewerage pipes and \nstorm drains. WASA has recently installed some chlorination facilities at selected tubewells, but \nmany tubewells have no disinfection facilities.  In addition, a preliminary study by the phase I \nproject consultants identified significant sources of pollution within the Rawal Lake Catchment, \nwhich feeds Rawalpindi. The Rawal Lake Catchment management plan was prepared under the \nphase I project, but has not yet been implemented. A comprehensive sampling and analysis \nprogram for the existing distribution network is needed to determine baseline quality levels, \nfollowed by necessary study for cost effective quality enhancement; and the proposed Rawal \nLake Catchment management plan should be reviewed and assisted to enforce control of \npollution from municipal, industrial, agricultural, and other developments within the catchment.    \n    \n5.  Limited Sewerage Coverage. The sewerage system of Rawalpindi presently serves \nonly about 30% of the population and some of this is ineffective because of blockages and poor \nmaintenance.5 Raw sewage, which discharges through piped or open channel systems into the \nnearest drains, cause serious public health and environmental problems.  Considerable work is \nrequired to connect properties to the existing system, by further developing the area sewerage \nand house connections network. Construction of trunk sewers, as per the sewerage master \nplan, and the connection of all primary/secondary sewers to these trunk sewers, will help reduce \nserious health hazards. \n    \n6.  Absence  of  Sewage  Treatment  and  Consequent  Environmental  and  Health \nHazards.  No sewage treatment facility is available for Rawalpindi municipal or industrial \nwastewaters, which discharge into storm water drains.  To safeguard public health and the \nenvironment and avoid flooding in the drains, all sewage should eventually be collected and \npiped through a new outfall sewer to a safe disposal location. \n   \n7.  Poor Condition of Stormwater Drainage. The urban drainage system, particularly to \nthe east of the city, is in very poor condition, having been neglected for many years.  In some \nareas, the system is undersized, restricted by encroachments and crossings, and blocked with \nsolid waste and other debris.  Major flooding occurs along these drains in each monsoon \nseason.  Upstream of the catchments, is a network of tertiary drains that are polluted by sewage \nand septic tank discharges, animal waste, and municipal solid waste.  Under the phase I project, \nthe main drain through the city\u2014Lai Nullah, is being extensively upgraded to remove blockages \nand improve hydraulic capacity.  However, the major tributaries to the Lai Nullah, such as Kassi \nEast and Kassi West, are not covered by these works and significant cleaning and rehabilitation \nwork is necessary to reduce flood potential and improve the environment.   \n \n8.  Solid Waste Management. Lack of an organized solid waste management system in \nthe  city  has  been  a  major  contributor  to  environmental  pollution.  The  Tehsil  Municipal \nAdministration  (TMA)  has  reportedly  made  some  progress  with  secondary  collection  and \n                                                 \n4 Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources. 2002. \n5 Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project, Rawalpindi, Phase II Concept Report, 2002. ", "    3 \ndisposal following initiatives funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nand Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and a new site has been purchased, for a \nsanitary landfill of 30 hectares at some distance from the city.  NGOs have also started some \ncommunity-led  primary  collection  initiatives.    The  major  issues  that  urgently  need  to  be \naddressed are provision of a transfer station, development of the sanitary landfill site, safe \ndisposal of hospital waste, and improvement of the community-led primary collection. Further, \nthe improvement in the overall solid waste management for sustained and efficient operations is \na  major  challenge  that  can  be  addressed  through  techniques  such  as  public-private \npartnerships together with strengthening the TMAs. \n \n9.  Institutional  Strengthening.  Under  the  phase  I  project,  some  major  financial  and \ninstitutional  reforms  were  implemented  and  WASA  staff  received  training.  As  a  result, \nconsiderable improvement in financial management was achieved and in 1999 WASA started \ngenerating  more  revenues  than  expenditures  (Appendix  1).  The  progress  toward  self-\nsustainability by WASA must be maintained and improved through proper and effective tariff \nstructures and revenue collection. In view of the recent devolution of the overall control of \nWASA  to  the  TMA,  it  is  essential  to  (i)  review  the  proposed  institutional  and  financial \narrangements to ensure sustainable operations in water supply, sewerage, drainage, and solid \nwaste management; and (ii) ensure that the revised tariff plan, as agreed under the phase 1 \nproject, is implemented according to the agreed schedule.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The overall purpose of the proposed Project is to improve living conditions and the \nquality of life of and reduce poverty among the people in Rawalpindi, where available water is \ninadequate to meet basic needs and environmental conditions are hazardous due to inadequate \nsewerage, drainage, and solid waste management facilities. The TA will prepare a Project that \nis suitable for ADB financing. The Project will facilitate sustainable urban development in the city \nand slum areas, alleviate water shortage, and address severe environmental problems faced by \npoor urban communities. The TA will also prepare recommendations for strengthening the TMA \nand  WASA  for  sustainable  operation  of  the  municipal  functions  under  the  government's \ndevolution plan. \n \n11.  The  TA  will  provide  the  overall  project  design,  scope,  cost,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and will formulate the terms of reference for the consultants to \nbe recruited to implement the Project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be implemented in two phases: phase 1\u2014situation analysis, and phase II\u2014\npreparation of the proposed Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement Project. The situation \nanalysis will include (i) a review of the master plans of the infrastructure development for water \nsupply, drainage, and sewerage; sewage treatment; and solid waste collection and disposal, \nprepared during the phase-I project; (ii) an evaluation of the technical sustainability of the \nphase-I project works, including the efficiency of the extended capacity of the Rawal Lake \nfiltration plant and the leakage detection and rectification program proposed to nullify loss of \nwater through leakages from the system, and an assessment of the scope of rehabilitation of \nthe water distribution system not covered under the phase-I project; (iii) a critical evaluation of \nthe  quality  of  water  supplied,  and  preparation  of  recommendations;  (iv)  a  review  of  the ", "4 \nadequacy of existing water supply and sewerage records for proper asset maintenance; (v) a \nreview of the TMA's solid waste management practices, and a management audit to ensure \nefficient collection and safe disposal; (vi) a review of the initiatives of community organizations, \nincluding the gender groups to improve local area environment; (vii) a review of the conditions in \nlow income communities and an assessment of poverty and environment infrastructure; and \n(viii) a review of the institutional capacity of TMA and WASA, and recommended actions for their \nstrengthening to ensure the sustainability of overall operations of municipal functions and that of \nfinancial reforms implemented for WASA under the phase 1 project.  Project preparation will \ninclude  development  of  community  participation;  formulation  of  priority  infrastructure;  \ninstitutional  arrangements;  and    preparation  of  an  environmental  infrastructure  investment \nprogram, with integrated urban development works. \n \n13.  Project interventions will specifically focus on low-income communities. The Project will \nbe prepared using community participation, including women\u2019s groups, and involving, wherever \nfeasible and appropriate, implementation through community-based organizations. The TA will \nreview governance issues relating to beneficiary and local government participation, especially \nthe devolution of powers to local governments, to (i) increase ownership, transparency, and \naccountability; and (ii) over the longer term, create an institutional framework that will increase \nempowerment  and  strengthen  social  capital.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $438,000 equivalent, comprising $217,000 in \nforeign exchange and $221,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance the entire \nforeign exchange cost and $133,000 equivalent of the local currency cost, totaling $350,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The government will provide $88,000 \nequivalent to cover the remuneration of counterpart staff, provision of office accommodation and \nfacilities,  field  surveys,  local  transportation  for  counterpart  staff,  and  funds  for  workshop \nactivities. The details of the cost estimates and financing arrangements are in Appendix 3. The \ngovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Housing,  Urban  Development  and  Public  Health  Engineering  Department \n(HUDPHED) of the Government of Punjab, and the Rawalpindi TMA will be the executing \nagencies for the TA. The deputy managing director of WASA will be the TA coordinator, who will \nbe supported by five senior engineers and administrative support staff to work full time with the \nconsultants.  Overall  guidance  for  TA  implementation  will  be  provided  through  a  steering \ncommittee to be chaired by the secretary, HUDPHED, with the Rawalpindi Tehsil head, and \ndirector  general  of  Rawalpindi  Development  Authority  as  vice  chairmen,  and  with \nrepresentatives from TMA, WASA, key project management unit staff of the phase I project, \ncapital  development  authority,  and  SDO,  as  members.  The  steering  committee  will  meet \nmonthly.  \n \n16.  The TA will require about 37.5 person-months of consulting services, comprising 8 \nperson-months  of  international  and  27.5  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  in  urban \ndevelopment; water supply, sanitation, and drainage; solid waste management; sewerage and \nsewage  treatment;  storm  water  drainage;  asset  management;  institutional  development; \nsociology and gender, resettlement, environment, economics, and finance. The TA will be ", "    5 \nundertaken by a firm to be recruited in accordance with the quality-and cost-based selection \nmethod of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will be requested to submit \nsimplified technical proposals. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are provided in \nAppendix 4. The consultants will procure equipment through direct purchase, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 5 months, during July 2003 to November 2003. The \nconsultants  will  submit  the  following  reports:  (i)  a  brief  inception  report,  2  weeks  after \ncommencing the services; (ii) an interim report, at the end of 2.5 months; (iii) a draft final report, \nat the end of the 4th month from start of the TA; and (iv) a final report, 2 weeks after receipt of \ncomments on the draft final report from the Government of Punjab and ADB. The TA will include \ntwo workshops, one after the submission of the inception report and another after the interim \nreport.  The  workshops  will  be  an  opportunity  to  contribute  to  the  planning  process  to \nrepresentatives of concerned agencies of Punjab and central government, the general public, \nmale  and  female  community  groups,  NGOs,  and  private  sector  organizations.  Tripartite \nmeetings will be held with the government, ADB, and the consultants following the submission \nof each report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to the Government \nof  Pakistan  for  preparing  the  Rawalpindi  Environmental  Improvement  Project,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board. The technical assistance, initially financed as a grant, will be \nsubject to the reimbursement arrangements set forth in Technical Assistance Operations6 and \nStreamlining of Technical Assistance Operations.7 If the technical assistance results in an ADB \nloan, ADB may charge against the loan, and recover from it, the portion of the initial grant that \nexceeds $250,000 equivalent.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1977.
