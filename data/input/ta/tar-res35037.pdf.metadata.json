INTRODUCTION\n1. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Policy on Agriculture and Natural Resources\nResearch  (ANRR),1  approved  in  1995,  identified  intensified  research  as  an  important\nintervention requiring ADB support to address the three critical issues of (i) reducing poverty,\n(ii) sustainable  management  of  agriculture  and  natural  resources,  and  (iii)  increasing  the\nproductivity of agriculture in the Asian and Pacific region. Under the ANRR policy, an annual\npackage of regional technical assistance (TA) through the Consultative Group on International\nAgricultural Research (CGIAR) centers of excellence was supported as a cost-effective means\nto  channel  ADB\u2019s  support.  The  Operations  Evaluation  Department  (OED)  conducted  the\nmandatory five-year review of the policy in 20002 and found that (i) the present policy on ANRR\nremained consistent with ADB\u2019s development objectives, (ii) the assistance to CGIAR and other\ninternational agricultural research centers (IARCs) has yielded high economic rates of return,\nand (iii) the current funding modality should be essentially maintained.\n2. In this context, ADB received requests for financing of 15 proposals from the IARCs\nfinanced by CGIAR. ADB staff critically reviewed the proposals and prioritized them based on (i)\nthe potential impact on reducing poverty, promoting sustainable management of agriculture and\nnatural resources, and increasing agricultural productivity; (ii) relevance to ADB operations in\nthe agriculture and natural resources sector; and (iii) high commitment of the participating\ncountries. Proposals considered high priority were discussed extensively with the centers to\nstrengthen the potential development impacts and linkages to national agricultural research\nsystems  (NARSs).  The  proposed  umbrella  technical  assistance  (TA),  which  is  the  sixth\npackaged assistance to CGIAR centers, will support four research projects in ADB\u2019s developing\nmember  countries  (DMCs)  that  were  submitted  by  the  following  CGIAR  centers:  (i)  the\nInternational Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Mexico City, Mexico, through its\nproject office based at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines;\n(ii) the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, through its office\nbased at IRRI, Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines; (iii) the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute\n(IPGRI), through its regional office in Serdang, Malaysia; and (iv) IRRI, through its headquarters\nat Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines.3\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The ADB Rural Asia Study4 highlighted developing Asia\u2019s remarkable progress in food\nsecurity, poverty reduction, and per capita income, driven by the green revolution. Between\n1970 and 1995, the Asian rural and general economy benefited from an almost doubling of\ncereal  production,  due  to  doubling  of  crop  yields,  while  the  cereal  area  harvested  barely\nchanged, increasing only 4 percent. Per capita income nearly tripled, while calorie consumption\nincreased by 24 percent. Increased local purchasing power drove local demand, spurring the\noverall economy. Poverty declined from about 60 percent in 1975 to about 30 percent in 1995.\nThe threat of famine, which loomed in the early 1960s over the region, disappeared. However,\ndespite the remarkable growth, poverty remained high. About 900 million or 68 percent of the\nworld\u2019s poor live in Asia: about 500 million in South Asia, 300 million in East Asia, and 100\nmillion in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.5\n                  \n1  R 253-95: The Bank\u2019s Policy on Agriculture and Natural Resources Research, 29 November 1995.\n2  IN.307-00: Special Evaluation Study on the Policy Implementation and Impact on Agriculture and Natural\nResources Research, December 2000.\n3  The proposed TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 March 2001.\n4  Asian Development Bank. 2000. Rural Asia: Beyond the Green Revolution, Manila.\n5  IFPRI. 1995. A 2020 Vision for Food, Agriculture and the Environment, October 1995.", "2\n4. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) forecasts that population in\nAsia will grow from 2.8 billion in 1990 to 4.2 billion in 2020. IFPRI also forecasts that the annual\ndemand for rice in Asia will increase from 307 metric tons (t) in 1990 to 495 million t in 2020; for\nmaize, from 123 million t to 238 million t; and for meat, from 38 million t to 111 million t. Food\nproduction will have to increase by another 260 million t or 40 percent more from the current\nlevel of 650 million t, and this under conditions of increasing land and water scarcity. Thus, there\nis an urgent need to raise agricultural productivity dramatically using technology driven by\nANRR.\n5. Recognizing the key role of agricultural research in increasing agricultural productivity\nand farm incomes, ADB has supported IARCs over the past three decades. ADB\u2019s priorities to\nfund  agricultural  research  became  more  focused  in  1995  when  its  policy  on  ANRR  was\napproved. The policy was in line with ADB\u2019s Medium-term Strategic Framework (1995-1998)6 at\nthe time and remains consistent with its new Long-term Strategic Framework (2001-2005).7\nUnder the ANRR policy, ADB supported five TA umbrella projects involving 14 CGIAR centers\nand 24 research projects between 1996 and 2000, amounting to $28.6 million. At the same\ntime, it also provided about $3.7 million for five research projects to three non-CGIAR centers\n(Appendix 1).\n6. Continued public support for ANRR is needed since the private sector has shown limited\ninterest in supporting research agenda targeting the needs of poor farmers. ADB\u2019s assistance to\nANRR through the CGIAR and non-CGIAR centers is justified since past research collaboration\nhas produced global and regional public goods that have significantly contributed to agricultural\nproductivity increases and poverty reduction. ADB should continue to channel assistance to the\nCGIAR centers because they have comparative advantage in conducting agricultural research.\nThese centers have highly qualified, multidisciplinary research teams who are in the forefront of\nscience and technology research. ADB's collaboration with these centers also gives many\nvalue-added benefits. For example, ADB, which provides on the average about 30-35 percent of\nthe total cost of the TA, is able to catalyze additional funds equivalent to about 65-70 percent of\nthe TA cost from the combined contributions of the CGIAR or non-CGIAR centers, NARSs, and\naid agencies. By financing collaborative research projects, ADB can be highly selective in\nchoosing the research proposal to support and, at the same time, have a say in finalizing the TA\nobjectives and scope, which is not possible if ADB merely contributes to the core budgets of\nthese centers. ADB has been able to strengthen the capability of NARSs from the DMCs in\nconducting  research,  including  cutting-edge  science  and  technology  research  such  as\nbiotechnology,  through  technical  backstopping  provided  by  CGIAR  scientists  during  TA\nimplementation. ADB is also able to promote regional cooperation on major research topics of\ninterest to the DMCS, particularly in increasing productivity of crops, fish, and livestock.\n7. The proposed TA will assist the DMCs in increasing crop and livestock productivity,\nincreasing farm incomes, improving the status of women, and attaining food security in the\nAsian and Pacific region. The proposed TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s policy on ANRR and fully\nmeets  the  three  strategic  development  agenda  in  the  policy  paper:  poverty  reduction,\nsustainable  management  of  agriculture  and  natural  resources,  and  increasing  agricultural\nproductivity.\n                  \n6  The Bank\u2019s Medium-Term Strategic Framework (1995-1998), March 1995.\n7  M17-01: Long-Term Strategic Framework of the ADB (2001-2015), 14 March 2001.", "3\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n8. The  main  objective  of  the  proposed  umbrella  TA  is  to  develop  environmentally\nsustainable farming systems, policies, improved crop varieties, and appropriate crop-livestock\ntechnologies  that  will  increase  agricultural  productivity  and  farm  incomes,  and  protect  the\nenvironment.  The  umbrella  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty\nreduction. The umbrella TA will contribute to the DMCs goals of reducing poverty, protecting the\nenvironment, improving the status of women, and promoting human resources development.\nB.  Scope\n9.  The umbrella TA comprises four independent, but mutually supportive research projects\nsince they share common goals and objectives. A brief synopsis of the economic importance of\neach project is in paras. 10-13. The detailed description of each project, including the TA\nframework, is in Appendixes 2-5.\n10. CIMMYT\u2019s  research  project  entitled  Developing  New  Maize  Germplasm  Through\nBiotechnology for Resource-Poor Farmers in Asia will address the ANRR strategic agenda of\nraising agricultural productivity. Maize is the third most important crop in Asia, where more than\n900 million poor and malnourished people, or 68 percent of the world\u2019s poor live. The project will\nbuild on the achievements of the phase 1 project,8 which succeeded in strengthening the\ncapacity of NARSs to apply biotechnology tools to improve maize, establishing fully operational\nbiotechnology laboratories, and identifying maize germplasm resistant to major diseases and\ntolerant of drought and low nitrogen fertility. The major problem affecting smallholder maize\nproduction in Asia is the fact that maize is grown in marginal, rainfed environments, with\nunreliable rainfall, poor soils, and unsuitable terrain. Insect pests and diseases also cause\nserious yield losses. The challenge, which this research project aims to meet, is to develop new\nmaize varieties suited to such marginal areas (Appendix 2).\n11. ILRI\u2019s research project entitled Improving Crop-Livestock Production Systems in Rainfed\nAreas of Southeast Asia will address the ANRR strategic agenda of sustainable management of\nagriculture and natural resources (Appendix 3). The proposed project will focus on livestock,\nwhich contributes up to 20 percent of the agricultural gross domestic product in Southeast Asian\ncountries. Since new arable land is limited and there are about 99 million hectares of rainfed\nland  in  Southeast  Asia,  further  increases  in  food  production  must  come  from  sustainable\nsystems developed for these agroecological areas. The project will build on the considerable\nprogress made in phase 1.9 New profitable technology for increasing fodder production and\novercoming  nutrient  deficiencies  in  livestock  has  been  found  and  policy  options  to  give\nsmallholder farmers equal opportunities in marketing of animals and animal products have been\nidentified. The project will benefit poor farmers because it will help them overcome the twin\nproblems of shortages of feed resources and poor nutrition, and engage more effectively in the\nmarketing of animals and animal products.\n                  \n8  TA  5766-REG:  Second Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at CGIAR Centers - Application of\nBiotechnology to Maize Improvement in Asia, for $1.4 million, approved on 29 December 1997. The project will be\ncompleted on 31 December 2001.\n9  TA 5812-REG: Third ANRR at CGIAR Centers - Increasing Productivity of Crop-Livestock Systems in Asia, for $1.0\nmillion, approved on 22 October 1998. The project will be completed on 31 December 2001.", "4\n12. IPGRI\u2019s  research  project  entitled  Developing  Sustainable  Coconut-Based  Income-\nGenerating Technologies in Poor Rural Communities will address the ANRR strategic agenda of\nreducing poverty (Appendix 4). About 90 percent of the world\u2019s coconut production comes from\nthe Asian and Pacific region. Coconut provides livelihood to about 50 million poor farmers in the\nworld, whose income is way below the poverty level. The research project was based on the\nresults of two ADB research projects and one project financed by the International Fund for\nAgricultural Development (IFAD),10 which identified coconut germplasm that can outyield the\ntraditional varieties 3-6 times, and which possesses traits required in developing high-value\ncoconut  by-products.  They  also  identified  opportunities  for  coconut-based  farming  systems\ntechnologies that could increase incomes 5-10 times. The proposed project will promote the\nproduction and marketing of high-value coconut products and quality planting materials, and\nintercropping and livestock/fodder production.\n13. IRRI\u2019s  research  project  entitled  Sustaining  Food  Security  in  Asia  Through  the\nDevelopment of Hybrid Rice Technology will address the ANRR strategic agenda of reducing\npoverty through increased rice production using hybrid rice (Appendix 5). Rice is the staple food\nof about three billion people in Asia\u2014the region where population is increasing by about 80\nmillion -100 million a year. Rice is critical to the region\u2019s poor people since about 90 percent of\nthe world\u2019s rice is consumed by those who produce it. Since the yields of many high-yielding\nvarieties (HYVs) have already reached a plateau, the proposed project is focusing on hybrid\nrice, which NARSs under phase 1 found to have a 15-20 percent yield advantage over popular\nHYVs. The proposed project will intensify research by nine DMCs to raise production through\nthe use of hybrid rice to sustain food security.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14. The total cost of the umbrella TA is estimated at $12.1 million equivalent (Appendix 6).\nADB will finance $4.0 million (33 percent of the total cost) on a grant basis from the ADB-funded\nTA Program. The CGIAR centers will finance $2.8 million (23 percent) from their core budgets,\nNARSs will contribute $3.6 million equivalent (30 percent), and other external funding agencies\nwill contribute $1.7 million equivalent (14 percent).\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n15. ADB will enter into an individual TA agreement with the CGIAR center concerned for\neach research project. Each center will be the Executing Agency for its project. The participating\nNARSs will be designated as Implementing Agencies (IAs). NARSs are qualified to serve as IAs\nbased on their experience as well as their capacity and commitment to undertake the work.\nEach center will appoint a team leader who will coordinate, supervise, and monitor the activities.\nSimilarly, each IA will appoint a national team leader for overall control of the work and to\nestablish research networks to promote regional cooperation and foster synergy in research\nactivities  through  exchange  of  germplasm,  information,  and  research  findings.  The  CGIAR\ncenters  will  help  NARSs  establish  partnerships  with  the  private  sector,  nongovernment\norganizations, and other community-based organizations in undertaking the research project so\nthat the latter\u2019s views can be incorporated in the design and implementation of the projects.\nIARCs and NARSs will disseminate the research results to small farmers through field tests of\n                  \n10 TA 5590-REG: Coconut Genetic Resources Network in Asia and the Pacific Region, for $800,000, approved on 29\nJuly 1994; TA 5766-REG: Second ANRR at CGIAR Centers - Coconut Genetic Resources Network and Human\nResources Strengthening in Asia and the Pacific (Phase II), for $1.2 million, approved on 29 December 1997; and\nIFAD TA, for $900,000, approved on 5 August 1998.", "5\nimproved germplasm on farmers\u2019 fields, field days, workshops, extension services, publications,\nand web sites.\n16. Each center will submit to ADB (i) a semiannual progress report, (ii) a semiannual\nfinancial statement accounting for the use of project funds, and (iii) an audited annual financial\nstatement.  Funds  will  be  drawn  down  in  semiannual  installments  based  on  each  center\u2019s\nestimate of forthcoming expenditures and subject to satisfactory liquidation of expenditures for\npreviously  disbursed  funds.  Each  project  will  commence  on  1  January  2002  and  will  be\nimplemented over three years. All studies will be completed by 31 December 2004, and the TA\naccount will be closed by 30 June 2005. Each center will submit a comprehensive completion\nreport to ADB within three months of the end of its project.\n17. The  concerned  centers  will  procure  goods  and  services  according  to  the  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. The centers will engage short-term specialists in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB, using\nthe  biodata  format.  Before  engaging  the  resource  specialists,  the  centers  will  submit  the\nspecialists\u2019 curricula vitae to ADB for approval. At ADB, a project officer with suitable technical\nexpertise will be assigned to administer each project, monitor the progress of the work, and\nconduct at least one supervision mission per year. The office of the Director, Agriculture and\nSocial  Sectors  Department  (East),  in  close  consultation  with  the  office  of  the  Director,\nAgriculture and Social Sectors Department (West), will be responsible for overall administration\nof the proposed umbrella TA, maintenance of the central accounts, and preparation of status\nreports.\nIV.

Introduction\n1.  Recognizing the need to support resource-poor farmers in Asia, the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) provided a technical assistance to the International Maize and Wheat Improvement\nCenter  (CIMMYT)  and  five  Asian  countries  for  a  research  project  on  the  Application  of\nBiotechnology  to  Maize  Improvement  in  Asia.1  The  project,  which  will  be  completed  in\nDecember  2001,  has  benefited  five  ADB  developing  member  countries  (DMCs):  People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC), India, Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand. In 1998, these countries\nestablished the Asian Maize Biotechnology Network (AMBIONET) and since then have applied\nbiotechnology techniques to improve maize. CIMMYT scientists and other leading experts in\nmaize biotechnology have provided hands-on training to participating maize researchers and\nintensive backstopping support in setting up biotechnology laboratories in these countries to the\nrequired optimum operational level. Basic biotechnology research work aimed at developing\nnew maize varieties adapted to marginal environments for poor farmers of Asia has now begun.\n2.  The DMCs have requested ADB assistance for a follow-up project entitled Developing\nNew Maize Germplasm Through Biotechnology for Resource-Poor Farmers in Asia. The DMCs\nwant to build on the success of their collaborative biotechnology research involving the use of\nmolecular  markers  to  identify  quantitative  trait  loci  (QTL)  to  develop  high-yielding  maize\nvarieties.  Under  the  proposed  project,  national  agricultural  research  systems  (NARSs)  will\ntransfer useful traits to locally adapted maize germplasm. These traits provide for high yields\nsince the varieties would be tolerant of abiotic stresses, such as drought and low nitrogen\nfertility. The varieties would require less pesticides since they would be resistant to diseases,\nsuch as downy mildew leaf disease. The new maize germplasm, with high-quality protein, will\npossess nutritious grains that can be used as food for people and feed for livestock.\nB. Background and Rationale\n3.  Maize is the third most important crop in Asia and is increasing in importance with the\ngrowth in the region\u2019s population. South Asia has more than 500 million poor people living on\nless than $1.0 per day and their number is increasing. The major problem affecting smallholder\nmaize production is the fact that maize is grown in marginal and fragile environments, with\nunreliable rainfall, poor soils, and unsuitable terrain. Insect pests and diseases also cause\nserious yield losses. Should continuing growth in demand for maize lead to further expansion in\nthe area planted to maize, this expansion can only occur in areas that are more fragile than\nthose currently cultivated. The challenge is to develop for such marginal areas new maize\nvarieties that are tolerant of drought and low nitrogen content in the soils, and resistant to major\npests and diseases.\n4.  The  International  Food  Policy  Research  Institute  (IFPRI)  has  projected  that  global\ndemand for maize will increase to 47 percent by 2020, from its 1995 level of 558 million tons (t)\nto 837 million t. By that time, about 57 percent of the world\u2019s maize consumption will occur in\ndeveloping countries, where the demand for maize as human food and animal feed will increase\nat an average annual rate of 2.2 percent. In Asia, the demand for maize is projected to increase\n                  \n1  TA 5766-REG, for $1.4 million, approved on 29 December 1997.", "17 Appendix 2, page 2\nfrom 123 million t in 1993 to 238 million t by 2020. Current maize production has not been able\nto keep up with the demand and Asia is a net importer of maize from other regions.\n5.  Biotechnology is providing maize researchers a powerful tool for crop improvement,\nwhich is faster, cheaper, and more precise than other chemical techniques. Researchers are\nable to identify one or more genes that confer the desired economic traits using molecular\nmarkers. These markers are used to identify improved plants that possess the economic traits,\nshortening the time needed for developing new improved crop varieties.\n6.  Between 1985 and 1993, the only regional biotechnology networks in place\u2014Rockefeller\nFoundation-assisted International Program on Rice Biotechnology and the ADB-assisted Asian\nRice Biotechnology Network (ARBN)2\u2014were focused on the improvement of rice germplasm.\nConvinced  of  the  rapid  gains  made  through  regional  collaborative  research  using  new\nbiotechnology  tools  for  developing  high-yielding  and  disease-resistant  rice  varieties,  ADB\nprovided funds to CIMMYT collaborating with five DMCs, which established AMBIONET in\n1998. Before the start of AMBIONET, NARSs were unable to apply biotechnology tools to maize\nimprovement due to inadequate funds from the national government, lack of a critical mass of\ntrained scientists, lack of training and experience, lack of research focus, poor communication\nand weak collaborative research links, and limited interactions between biotechnologists and\nscientists from other disciplines.\n7.  After three years, AMBIONET succeeded in developing the capacity of national maize\nimprovement programs to apply biotechnology tools to maize improvement, established fully\noperational biotechnology laboratories in all the five NARSs, established regional collaborative\nresearch on maize improvement, and promoted information exchange among members. An\nAMBIONET  service  laboratory,  which  was  established  at  the  International  Rice  Research\nInstitute  (IRRI),  Los  Ba\u00f1os,  has  become  a  regional  node  for  exchanging  biotechnology\nresources and information and the center for regional maize diversity study. AMBIONET helped\nform multidisciplinary research teams, integrated biotechnology with conventional breeding, and\napplied molecular marker technology for varietal improvement. All the laboratories collaborated\nin  mapping  and  marker-assisted  selection  in  which  markers  associated  with  important\nagronomic traits were identified.\n8.  NARSs focused on mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS) work involving three\nmaize diseases of major importance to them: downy mildew fungal disease in PRC, India,\nIndonesia, and Philippines; and the sugar cane mosaic virus (Strain B) (SCMV-B) and maize\nrough dwarf virus (MRDV) in the PRC. Several NARSs ( PRC, India, and Thailand) are at an\nadvanced  stage  of  mapping  and  MAS  work  involving  these  maize  diseases,  and  have\nsucceeded in developing early generation materials. These research activities will be intensified\nunder the project. All NARSs completed their study of maize genetic diversity. Those working on\nthe downy mildew problem also completed characterizing the pathogen or organism causing the\ndisease. Within a short period, NARSs have evaluated germplasm that are resistant to downy\nmildew disease and two viruses, and tolerant of drought and low nitrogen fertility. Work on them\nwould be intensified under the proposed follow-up project.\n                  \n2  TA 5510-REG: Establishment of the Asian Rice Biotechnology Network (ARBN), for $900,000, approved on 24\nNovember 1992. This TA was continued in two follow-up studies under TA 5667-REG: ARBN\u2014from Products to\nImpact,  for  $850,000,  approved  on  9  January  1996;  and  TA  5812-REG: ARBN: Achieving Impact and\nSustainability, for $1,680,000, approved on 22 October 1998.", "18 Appendix 2, page 3\n9.  AMBIONET has placed emphasis on facilitating interactions among network members\nand effective communication and information sharing. By designing experiments as a network\nand  pooling  country  data  for  regionwide  studies,  there  is  value-added  to  the  information\ngenerated by these teams. All teams are connected by Internet where paperless reports and\nnewsletters are circulated. The AMBIONET maintains a home page in the CIMMYT web site,\nwhich is mirrored in Thailand for easier access to the network members and to the region for\nnon-AMBIONET  member  countries.  Nine  issues  of  the  AMBIONET  Newsletter  have  been\npublished and distributed as both electronic and printed copies.\n10. Four significant advances in maize biotechnology have been achieved: (i) molecular\nmaps for maize have been constructed in advanced biotechnology laboratories and can be used\nto locate major genes of economic importance and a string of many minor genes called QTL;\n(ii) the arrangement of genetic and DNA markers on the chromosomes of major cereals, such\nas maize, rice, wheat, barley, and rye, has been found to be similar, and based on the concept\nof genome collinearity it means that the location of a gene can be inferred from one map to\nanother, thus extending the usefulness of such molecular maps; (iii) gene machines, which are\nlarge collections of maize plants whose genomes contain transposons, have been developed,\nallowing the identification of the function of a gene sequence; by using transposons almost any\ngene of interest can be identified, tagged, and isolated for use in varietal improvement; and\n(iv) genetic engineering in maize has become a routine technology for introducing novel gene\nsequences to express desired traits.3 Under the ongoing study, biotechnology research has\nfocused on applying molecular marker technology to characterize the genetic diversity of locally\nadapted maize germplasm in five Asian countries and mapping QTLs for resistance to diseases\nand  soil-related  stresses.  The  capacity-building  component  under  the  research  project  will\nempower scientists to apply these scientific breakthroughs in their national maize improvement\nprograms to address the needs of subsistence farmers, who constitute the vast majority of the\nregion\u2019s  maize  producers.  NARSs  will  need  to  continue  taking  responsibility  for  providing\nimproved maize varieties suited to the marginal areas where the subsistence farmers are\nlocated, since the private sector has shown limited interest in supporting the research agenda\nfor resource-poor farmers.\n11.  The proposed project addresses the strategic concerns expressed in the ADB\u2019s new\nLong-term Strategic Framework,  which  focuses  on  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,\nenvironmental conservation, and human resources development. The project is also consistent\nwith ADB\u2019s agriculture and natural resources research policy.4\nC. The Proposed Project\n1.  Objective\n12.  The proposed research project seeks to advance biotechnology research and varietal\ndevelopment in nine NARSs in six ADB DMCs to benefit resource-poor farmers in rainfed\nenvironments. It will assist in intensifying the application of biotechnology tools for developing\nlocally adapted, high-yielding maize varieties with resistance to major diseases, tolerance for\nsoil-related stresses, and improved nutritional value. The goal is to increase the farm income of\npoor farmers in DMCs participating in the network. To accelerate progress in NARSs, two new\nresearch initiatives will be pursued: (i) mapping and marker-aided selection for resistance to\n                  \n3  It  is  noted  that  under  the  proposed  study,  no  work  on  genetic  engineering  will  be  done.  Instead,  maize\nimprovement will be pursued by developing molecular maps and applying markers for selection.\n4  R 253-95: The Bank\u2019s Policy on Agriculture and Natural Resources Research, 29 November 1995.", "19 Appendix 2, page 4\nbanded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) disease, and (ii) utilizing molecular markers to transfer the\nmajor gene controlling QPM to enhance the nutritional content of maize grains.\n2.  Scope\n13.  The  project  will  have  four  components:  (i)  conduct  collaborative  research  to  apply\nbiotechnology  techniques  for  developing  high-yielding  maize  varieties  for  marginal  areas,\n(ii) strengthen the research capability of NARSs by providing them with specialized training\ntailored to meet their particular biotechnology needs and backstopping by CIMMYT scientists to\nresearchers  in  participating  laboratories,  (iii)  develop  the  network  as  a  vehicle  to  facilitate\ncommunication and information dissemination among members and to promote partnerships\nwith advanced research institutions and the private sector, and (iv) conduct workshops to\ncommunicate technical breakthroughs and to develop skills in planning projects and preparing\nproposals to compete for future funding to ensure the sustainability of the AMBIONET network.\nThe TA framework is in Table A2.1.\n3.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14.  The total cost of the proposed project, including contingencies, is estimated at $2.8\nmillion equivalent. It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $1.0 million from the ADB-funded\nTA Program to finance about 36 percent of the total cost of the study. The remaining 64 percent\nwill be financed by CIMMYT ($900,000 or 32 percent of the total cost), NARSs ($720,000\nequivalent or 26 percent), and the private sector ($180,000 or 6 percent). NARSs will provide\nmostly  in-kind  contributions  and  their  expenses  in  conducting  research  work,  procuring\nlaboratory chemicals and small equipment, and local training. The cost estimates and financing\nplan are in Table A2.2.\n4.  Implementation Arrangements\n15.  CIMMYT, which has performed satisfactorily in implementing the phase 1 project, will\nserve as the Executing Agency (EA) for the proposed project. It will administer and coordinate\nthe project through its office located at IRRI Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines. CIMMYT scientists and\nstaff at the headquarters in Mexico and in the region will provide technical backstopping and\nspecialized  biotechnology  training  to  network  scientists  and  researchers  at  CIMMYT\nheadquarters and at the biotechnology laboratories in the participating countries.\n16.  Nine NARSs from six ADB DMCs will participate in the project\u2014 PRC, India, Indonesia,\nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Viet Nam, which requested to join the phase 2 project, was\nadded considering that it has an existing complement of scientists and facilities for applying\nbiotechnology  to  crop  improvement  and  a  strong  team  of  maize  breeders.  The  list  of\nImplementing Agencies is in Table A2.3. As part of the network\u2019s approach, each NARS will\nconduct specific research important to its national maize improvement program. Under phase 1,\nresearch focused on three major activities: (i) genetic diversity study of locally adapted maize\ngermplasm, (ii) mapping and marker-assisted breeding for resistance to downy mildew and virus\ndiseases, and (iii) mapping and marker-assisted breeding for tolerance for drought and low\nnitrogen fertility. These research activities will be intensified under the proposed project.\n17.  Under  the  proposed  project,  NARSs  will  also  conduct  two  new  research  initiatives\ninvolving mapping and marker-assisted breeding for resistance to BLSB fungal disease and\nenhancement of the nutritional content of the maize seed through QPM. NARSs have identified\nBLSB as an emerging high-priority economic problem since it appears with increasing frequency", "20 Appendix 2, page 5\nin the major maize-growing regions in five participating countries. A biotechnology approach is\nneeded since no maize cultivars or germplasm have been found to be resistant to this new\ndisease. By using molecular markers, NARSs seek to develop locally adapted cultivars with\nhigh protein content by incorporating QPM with resistance to diseases and tolerance for drought\nand low nitrogen fertility. CIMMYT, which developed the technique for transferring the QPM\ntraits into elite maize materials, has agreed to transfer this technology to the network members\nunder the proposed project. CIMMYT will monitor the impact of the maize technology on the\nenvironment during field testing of improved materials.\n18.  The director of CIMMYT\u2019s Applied Biotechnology Center and Bioinformatics will serve as\nproject director for the TA. CIMMYT will engage the services of a full-time TA project manager\nto manage and coordinate implementation of the study. An executive committee, comprising the\nrepresentatives  of  the  six  countries  and  CIMMYT,  will  be  established  at  the  beginning  of\nimplementation to guide the network and support the national teams. Each country will select at\nleast one maize breeder and one molecular biologist to serve as co-team leaders. Countries\nwith more than one NARS participating in the project will appoint country coordinators with\noverall responsibility for implementing the work program and for coordinating the activities of the\nnational team.\n19.  The project will be implemented over three years (2002-2004). The first meeting will be\nheld at the beginning of the first year to introduce the project\u2019s goal, objectives, strategies, and\nwork plan, and to set direction and priorities. The succeeding annual meetings will take place at\nthe beginning of the second and the third years to assess progress made and determine the\nwork programs for the succeeding years. CIMMYT will submit to ADB semiannual progress\nreports, semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of the TA funds, and the audited\nannual financial statements. Funds will be drawn down every six months based on CIMMYT\u2019s\nestimate of the six months activities, subject to satisfactory liquidation of expenditures every six\nmonths. CIMMYT\u2019s will submit a comprehensive project completion report to ADB within three\nmonths after completion of the project. CIMMYT will be responsible for procuring laboratory\nequipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n20. At ADB, the project will be assigned to a project officer from the Agriculture and Social\nSectors Department (East) with the appropriate expertise. The project officer will monitor the\nprogress of implementation and will conduct reviews as appropriate.", "21 Appendix 2, page 6\nTable A2.1: Technical Assistance Framework,\nInternational Maize and Wheat Improvement Center\nProject Monitoring\nDesign Summary Targets Risks / Assumptions\nMechanism\nA.

Introduction\n1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing support to the International Livestock\nResearch Institute (ILRI) and five ADB developing member countries (DMCs) under the ongoing\nproject entitled Increasing Productivity of Crop-Livestock Systems in Asia.1 The project will be\ncompleted by end-December 2001. The objective is to generate technology and policy options\nto increase the productivity and economic viability of smallholder crop-livestock systems in\nrainfed areas of Southeast and East Asia. The project is being carried out through multi-\ndisciplinary efforts at research stations of the national agricultural research systems (NARSs)\nand on farms at benchmark sites (BMS) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia,\nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.2 The project supports the efforts of ILRI and the NARSs\nfirst  to  evaluate  various  technology  options  and  then  to  work  with  farmers  to  adopt  the\nappropriate technologies on a large scale. Due to the encouraging results obtained by the\nNARSs,  they  requested  support  for  three  more  years  to  refine  the  more  productive  crop-\nlivestock  systems  and  to  apply  the  advances  already  achieved  from  research  to  a  more\ndevelopment-oriented process for wider dissemination.\nB.  Background and Rationale\n2. Over the next 20 years in Southeast Asia, the projected demand for meat will double or\neven triple in some areas, and that for milk will increase to about 2.2 times what it is today.3 The\nprojected  increases  are  due  to  a  combination  of  population  growth,  increased  disposable\nincome, and changing consumer preferences. Technology and policy improvements are needed\nto ensure that the poor reap their share of the benefits from this increased demand, given that\n95 percent of the farm animals in rainfed areas of Southeast Asia are owned by resource-poor\nfarmers. Limited feed resources and poor nutrition are two of the main constraints to improved\nproductivity in smallholder crop-livestock systems. Leguminous forage and multinutrient block\nlicks (MNBLs) are examples of efficient and economical ways to address nutrient deficiencies in\nsmallholder livestock. An appropriate policy framework is also needed to allow poor farmers to\nengage more effectively in the marketing and trade of animals and animal products.\n3. The agriculture sector contributes an average of 32 percent to the gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) of Southeast Asian countries, and an average of 66 percent of each country\u2019s\npopulation depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Livestock contribute up to 20 percent of\nagricultural GDP, and this share is expected to increase with economic development. Since\narable land is limited and rainfed areas cover about 99 million hectares in Southeast Asia,\nfurther increases in food production must come from developing sustainable systems for the\nrainfed agroecological zones that were bypassed by the green revolution.\n                  \n1 TA 5812-REG, for $1.0 million, approved on 22 October 1998.\n2 The five BMS are (i) Bixi Xiang, Nanjian County, Yunnan, PRC; (ii) Kecamatan Cilawu, Garut, West Java,\nIndonesia;  (iii)  Barrio  Don  Montano,  Umingan  District,  Pangasinan,  Philippines;  (iv)  Amphur  Muang,\nMahasarakham, Thailand; and (v) Dong Tam Village, Dong Phu District, Bin Phuoc, Viet Nam.\n3  Delgado, C., M. Rosegrant, H. Steinfeld, S. Ehui, and C. Courbois. 1999. Livestock to 2020: The Next Food\nRevolution. IFPRI, Washington, D.C., USA. 72 pp.", "26 Appendix 3, page 2\n4. Integrated crop-livestock systems are complex. Both crops and livestock fulfil critical\nroles to meet poor farmers\u2019 subsistence needs and provide a surplus for the market, and their\ninteractions through feed, manure, and draft power contribute to the sustainability of the farming\nsystems and the stability of rural households. Without livestock, these production systems will\ncollapse. Livestock in mixed systems in Asia contribute the equivalent of $551 million of nitrogen\nand $154 million of phosphorus fertilizers per year in irrigated areas.4 Crop-livestock systems\ncurrently produce 90 percent of the milk, 77 percent of the ruminant meats, 47 percent of the\npork and poultry meats, and 31 percent of the eggs in Southeast Asia. Livestock contribute\nsignificantly to total farm income; for example, 31 percent comes from cattle in the three-strata\nforage  system  under  study  in  Indonesia,5  and  76  percent  comes  from  small  ruminants  in\nnomadic production systems in India.6 Household surveys indicate that the per capita annual\nincome levels of $90 - $257 at the BMS are well below the poverty level of $365 per person per\nyear established by the World Bank. The objective of the proposed project is to improve these\nlevels by about 30 percent over three years.\n5. Women are heavily involved in rainfed agriculture throughout Southeast Asia. Because\nof division of labor and household responsibilities by gender, the burden of poverty often falls\ndisproportionately  on  women.  Women  and  children  are  heavily  involved  in  livestock\nmanagement and actively participate in making decisions on the use of income from raising\nanimals. This indicates the need for developments in crop-livestock systems to target women\nand incorporate gender analysis, which the proposed project will do.\n6. Significant advances have been made in achieving the three objectives of the ongoing\nproject. The first objective is to develop improved livestock feed production and utilization\ntechnologies. The assessment of year-round feed availability has identified critical feed shortage\nperiods lasting for about 7 months at the BMS in the PRC and 6-7 months at the BMS in\nThailand.  Strategies  to  mitigate  the  shortages  include  increased  fodder  production  by\nintroducing cowpea and mungbean into cropping systems in Thailand, which has also improved\nsoil fertility. The development of the three-strata forage system involving cash crops, grasses,\nand shrubs and trees in Indonesia has enabled farmers to raise more cattle on their land and\nincreased livestock weight gain by 52 percent per hectare. It also reduced soil erosion by 57\npercent and increased the supply of fuelwood six times. The Government has adopted this\nconcept. Preliminary results from tests of MNBLs as supplements to rice and/or wheat straw-\nbased diets in PRC, Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand produced livestock live weight gains of\n10-67 percent and increased farmers' income from $11 to $52 per animal over four months\nfeeding. With dairy cows, MNBL combined with dried cassava leaves gave a gross profit margin\nof $52 per cow over four months. Combining MNBL with cassava peelings, a by-product of\nstarch production, increased farmers\u2019 income by $46 per animal over four months feeding.\nAnother example concerns the use in semiarid West Africa of manure, which, when combined\nwith inorganic fertilizer, sustained and increased the yield of sorghum twofold over 30 years,\ncompared with the use of fertilizers alone.7 In the ongoing project, manure has consistently\n                  \n4  de Haan, C., H.

The second objective is to identify policy options to improve incentives for smallholders\nraising  ruminant  livestock.  This  is  being  pursued  in  policy  studies  in  Viet  Nam  and  the\nPhilippines.  Without  adequate  policy  support,  smallholders  in  crop-livestock  systems  are\ndisadvantaged.  Preliminary  results  from  Viet  Nam  indicate  that  animal  productivity  is  low,\nimproved breeds are scarcely used, animal health and veterinary services are inadequate,\nextension and research systems are poorly funded, markets for livestock products function\npoorly, and prices of feed and meat are high while quality is low. About $58.0 million is lost\nannually from animal mortality due to inefficient animal health services. In the Philippines,\nsmallholders face a serious lack of access to credit for working capital, and are vulnerable to the\ndictates of middlemen and market malpractice. Emerging policy options indicate that increased\navailability  of  credit,  better  marketing  infrastructure,  and  lower  transactions  costs  may  be\nappropriate  for  smallholder  crop-animal  systems  in  rainfed  areas.  These  and  other  policy\noptions will be further studied in the proposed project.\n8. The third objective is to improve the NARSs\u2019 research capabilities and capacity. Two 2-\nweek regional training courses on approaches and methodologies for crop-livestock systems\nresearch, and systems analysis and impact assessment were conducted for 46 participants.\nTraining on crop-animal systems was also offered for 90 NARS research and extension staff,\nand 12 MS and 6 PhD students were involved in the project in the five countries. The following\ntraining products were prepared: training manual on Methodologies for Crop-Livestock Systems\nResearch; a CD-ROM on Farmers, People and the Environment (1999); bibliographic database\non crop-livestock systems in Asia (1,700 entries); CD-ROM on Methods and Tools for Crop-\nLivestock  Systems  Research;  and  geographical  information  system-based  report  on  geo-\nreferenced database on crop-livestock systems.\n9. The  Crop  Animal  Systems  Research  Network  (CASREN)  was  established  as  a\nmechanism to link research and development (R&D) activities among the five participating\ncountries. CASREN has facilitated exchange of information on R&D efforts in crop-livestock\nsystems and methodologies, and disseminated information through newsletters, and publication\nin proceedings and journals. Together, the results emphasize the need to enhance agricultural\nproductivity in less favorable environments. They support the conclusion that agriculture and\nnatural resources research has played an important role in promoting agricultural and rural\ndevelopment, and that ADB together with the international agricultural research centers and aid\nagencies are well placed to drive the research agenda.8\n10. The  strategy  of  the  proposed  project  is  to  validate  and  sustain  the  collaborative,\nmultidisciplinary, and participatory approaches used to improve the productivity of crop-livestock\nsystems. It will target about 1,740 more households or 40 percent of those at the BMS and 20\npercent in alternative locations with comparable agroecological conditions. It will also assist the\nNARSs\u2019 efforts to seek increased investment for R&D activities in crop-livestock systems in\nrainfed environments by improving their capability to develop project proposals. The ongoing\nproject has already resulted in increased funding from the provincial government in Viet Nam for\ncattle development at the BMS. Similarly in the PRC, the Yunnan Bureau of Agriculture has\noffered more funds to further support the activities at the BMS. To extend the impact of the R&D\nactivities, a new BMS will be established in Sichuan Province, one of the poorest provinces of\n                  \n8  IN.307-00.

The  proposed  project  addresses  the  strategic\nconcerns expressed in ADB\u2019s new Long-term Strategic Framework, which focuses on economic\ngrowth, poverty reduction, environmental conservation, and human resources development. The\nproject is consistent with ADB\u2019s agriculture and natural resources research policy.9\nC.  The Proposed Project\n1.  Objectives\n11. The  objectives  are  to  (i)  use  participatory  approaches  to  spread  the  application  of\nappropriate technologies by farmers to enhance the productivity of crop-livestock systems;\n(ii) develop and recommend policy changes to improve market participation, competitiveness,\nand  trade  for  smallholders  and  conduct  policy  dialogue  with  governments  on  these  policy\nissues; and (iii) continue to develop the capabilities of the NARSs to conduct independent\nresearch  on  crop-livestock  systems,  and  of  extension  workers  to  encourage  adoption  of\ntechnologies by farmers.10 The goal is to reduce poverty among smallholder farmers in rainfed\nenvironments.\n2.  Scope\n12. The proposed project will be conducted at the same five BMS for the ongoing project.\nOne new BMS in Sichuan Province will be added to the network to be financed separately by a\nnew NARS assisted by CIP and ILRI. The project will comprise activities in (i) R&D, (ii) policy\ndevelopment and dialogue, and (iii) capacity building in research and technology transfer. In the\nR&D component, the project will: (i) validate promising year-round feeding system technologies\nat  the  BMS  and  field  test  them  in  alternative  locations;  (ii)  monitor  the  impacts  of  the\ntechnologies  on  animal  productivity,  farm  incomes,  gender,  and  the  environment;  and\n(iii) disseminate the validated technologies on a large scale in the participating countries.\n13. In the policy development and dialogue component, the project will (i) identify the factors\nthat promote and/or constrain the adoption of improved technologies by smallholders; (ii) assess\nthe impact of livestock sector trends, trade, and public policies on the competitiveness and\nmarket  participation  of  different  types  of  farmer  production  systems  and  on  employment\ngeneration; (iii) quantify the contribution of women and the other members of the family in the\ncrop-livestock production systems in rainfed areas; and (iv) prepare policy issue papers for\nthree countries (Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam) after identifying policy options that will\nimprove technology adoption, promote equitable market participation, lower transaction costs,\nand benefit women.\n14. In the capacity-building component, the project will (i) organize and conduct regional\ntraining courses for NARSs and NGOs to disseminate information on appropriate crop-livestock\nsystems research, and policy analysis; (ii) develop highly interactive knowledge and information\nproducts to support R&D activities; (iii) package information products generated from the project\nin a suitable form and distribute them across the region; (iv) develop network linkages for\n                  \n9  R 253-95: The Bank\u2019s Policy on Agriculture and Natural Resources Research, 29 November 1995.\n10 ILRI will collaborate with Indonesia\u2019s Central Research Institute for Agricultural Socioeconomic (CRAIS) on training\nof communities based on the participatory approach.", "29 Appendix 3, page 5\ntechnology transfer; (v) assist NARSs to prepare appropriate R&D proposals on crop-livestock\nsystems; and (vi) prepare a training manual to strengthen the role of women in livestock\ndevelopment in rainfed areas. Associated with these are monitoring and evaluation activities:\n(i) conduct seminars with policy makers and other stakeholders to discuss project results and\nplan to implement the recommendations; and (ii) assess the impact of the R&D outputs on the\npoor and their livelihoods. The TA framework is in Table A3.1.\n3.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The  total  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $3.5  million  equivalent,  including\ncontingencies. It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $1.0 million (28 percent of the total\ncost) from the ADB-funded TA Program. ILRI will provide $795,000 (23 percent) while NARSs\nwill  provide  $940,000  equivalent  (27  percent),  primarily  as  in-kind  contribution  (local  staff,\nlaboratory space and equipment, and experimental fields). An additional $780,000 equivalent\n(22 percent) will be provided through the combined initiative of a new NARS (the Chongqing\nSwine Academy from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences - CAAS), CIP, and ILRI\n(Table A3.2).\n4.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. ILRI, which has provided satisfactory coordination and leadership in implementing phase\n1, will be the Executing Agency. The NARSs will be the Implementing Agencies (Table A3.3).\nILRI will continue to be responsible for the overall technical and financial management of the\nstudy, including providing technical backstopping for participating NARSs. The ILRI team based\nat  Los  Ba\u00f1os  in  the  Philippines  includes  specialists  in  natural  resources  management,\nagricultural economics, nutrition and farming systems, and animal science. Specialists based at\nILRI  headquarters  in  Addis  Ababa,  Nairobi,  and  other  locations  will  provide  technical\nbackstopping. The existing steering committee will meet annually to approve the yearly plan of\noperation and the budget allocations, monitor progress in implementing the project, and approve\nthe annual progress reports before they are submitted to ADB.\n17. The project will be implemented over three years beginning on 1 January 2002. ILRI will\norganize and conduct one project planning and two review workshops, and one final symposium\nto disseminate the research results and provide a forum for discussion with institutions, policy\nmakers, and aid agencies. ILRI will submit the following reports to ADB: (i) semiannual progress\nreports, (ii) semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of study funds, and (iii) an\nannual audited financial statement. Funds will be drawn down in semiannual installments based\non ILRI\u2019s estimate of the forthcoming six-month expenditures, and ADB will disburse TA funds\nfor the project subject to satisfactory liquidation of past expenditures by ILRI. ILRI will procure\ngoods and services and recruit short-term specialists in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  as  appropriate,  or  through  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB.

Introduction\n1. Between 1994 and 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Fund\nfor Agricultural Development (IFAD) provided support to three separate research projects to the\nInternational Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) and 20 national agricultural research\nsystems (NARSs) in the Asian and Pacific region.1 These projects identified coconut germplasm\nthat can outyield the traditional varieties 3-6 times and possess characteristics contributing to\nthe  production  of  high-value  products,2  constraints  affecting  coconut  development,  and\nopportunities  for  coconut-based  farming  systems  technologies  that  could  increase  the\nhousehold incomes of poor farmers and disadvantaged women in the rural areas up to 5-6\ntimes. In an effort to reduce poverty in existing resource-poor coconut communities affected by\nreduced  demand  for  copra  and  coconut  oil,  eight  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)\nrequested  ADB  to  support  a  follow-up  project  for  Developing  Sustainable  Coconut-Based\nIncome-Generating Technologies in Poor Rural Communities. The DMCs would like to develop\nsustainable, coconut-based technologies that would increase farm incomes and promote food\nsecurity in the rural areas. The technologies are important since the combined area planted to\ncoconut in the eight DMCs totals about 9.6 million hectares, or about 90 percent of the total\ncoconut areas in the world.\nB. Background and Rationale\n2. About  50  million  resource-poor  farmers  in  the  world  depend  on  coconut  for  their\nlivelihood. Their annual income averages about $200, which is way below the poverty level of\nabout $350 per annum based on World Bank standards. About 90 percent of the world\u2019s\ncoconut production comes from the Asian and Pacific region. In several countries in the region,\ncoconut contributes 15-50 percent of export earnings.\n3. In the past 20 years, coconut farmers have suffered from low farm productivity and\nunstable and low international market prices for copra and coconut oil\u2013two coconut products\ntraded  internationally.  Due  to  low  income,  farmers  lack  the  resources  to  invest  in  new\ntechnologies including improved varieties and hybrids, and necessary fertilizers and other inputs\nfor increasing yields. Despite the low returns, farmers continue to grow coconut as it provides\nthem a regular, although marginal, source of income when harvested every 45 days. Likewise,\ncoconut is traditionally a part of the rural food system and is a major source of nutrition for many\nrural communities. While there is tremendous potential to tap idle community labor, including\nwomen, to generate income from high-value coconut products and other income-generating\ntechnologies, these activities and strategies are not yet in place.\n                  \n1  TA 5590-REG: Coconut Genetic Resources Network in Asia and the Pacific Region, for $800,000, approved on 29\nJuly 1994; TA 5766-REG: Coconut Genetic Resources Network and Human Resources Strengthening in Asia and\nthe Pacific (Phase II), and IFAD TA, for $900,000, approved on 5 August 1998.\n2  The  two  TAs  provided  by  Asian  Development  Bank  also  met  their  objectives  of  forming  an  international\ncollaborative network for coconut research, collecting and conserving coconut germplasm threatened by genetic\nerosion, completing the characterization of coconut varieties and hybrids in the germplasm banks; strengthened the\nresearch  capabilities  of  NARS  scientists  in  the  region  through  training  courses;  and  promoted  sharing  of\ntechnologies, information, and germplasm.", "36 Appendix 4, page 2\n4. Completed projects have demonstrated that the incomes of poor farmers and women\ncan be increased 5-10 times by deploying high-yielding varieties and hybrids, producing and\nmarketing high-value coconut products derived from the coconut kernel (meat), husk, shell,\nwater,  wood,  and  leaves;  and  introducing  improved  intercropping  and  livestock/fodder\nproduction technologies. The proposed project identified several technical, institutional, and\nmarketing  constraints  that  prevent  poor  farmers  from  benefiting  from  the  results  of  these\nstudies. They are lack of affordable and appropriate implements and equipment for making\nhigh-value  products,  lack  of  technological  know-how  and  extension  materials,  limited\ndevelopment support from government agencies to poor coconut-based communities, lack of\nstrong grassroots organization, weak leadership, and poor community participation in their own\ndevelopment. Furthermore, poor communities have no access to large quantities of affordable\nand good-quality planting materials and to affordable credit to support their agricultural activities\nand handicraft programs.\n5. Many high-value products that can increase income per household from $200 to $400\nper  month,  through  either  individual  efforts  or  cooperative-based  associations,  have  been\nidentified. The list contains 20 products from the Philippines, 17 from Thailand, and 15 from Viet\nNam. A woman\u2019s nongovernment organization in Bangladesh (Banchte Sheka or Learning to\nSurvive) enabled 126 unemployed participants to earn additional income by making rope and\ndoormats  from  coconut  husks.  They  also  participated  in  the  community-managed  coconut\nnurseries, which can supply improved varieties of coconut at a low price and in large quantities.\nThere is great potential to increase the number of women participants to 500. Two models of\nfarm  equipment,  with  capacity  suited  to  individuals  or  the  whole  village,  are  available  for\nextracting high-quality, pure coconut oil, but they need to be tested for suitability in the rural\nareas and cost-efficiency. It is proposed that such tests be conducted under the proposed\nproject.\n6. Intercropping under coconut can also increase farm incomes, for example, interplanting\nbanana, pineapple, and lime in Malaysia; interplanting banana and maize in the Philippines; and\ninterplanting taro in Samoa. Rural communities can also earn additional income by intercropping\nimproved  forage  grasses  with  coconut  and  planting  legume  trees  as  hedge  rows  on  the\nperimeter fence of farms and farmhouses, to supply feed to livestock such as cattle and goats.\nThe additional incomes could lift poor families above the poverty line and also provide food\nsecurity against natural calamities.\n7. The  strategy  of  the  proposed  project  is  to  develop  sustainable  income-generating\ntechnologies for poor coconut communities in marginal rainfed areas. The technologies will\nincrease the incomes of resource-poor farmers, who depend on poorly maintained, low-income\ncoconut  farms  for  livelihood.  The  proposed  project  will  introduce  farmers  to  improved\nintercropping practices, improved livestock/fodder production, and new equipment for improving\nquality and efficiency for handicraft making using various parts of the coconut. Furthermore, the\nproject  will  help  in  developing  community-based  coconut  seedling  nurseries  to  generate\nemployment and to make available improved varieties for special uses and purposes in the rural\nareas. Poorly organized rural communities will be given training on participatory approaches to\nstrengthen the skills of village leaders and ensure the full participation of all members of the\ncommunity. Research and extension officers and staff, women\u2019s groups, and NGOs will also be\ntrained to ensure that the required government support in implementing various activities is\nmade available. Market surveys will also be conducted to identify potential marketing outlets for\nhandicrafts and other products, which have potential in the nearby urban centers or regional\nmarkets and overseas.", "37 Appendix 4, page 3\n8. ADB's new Long-term Strategic Framework places considerable emphasis on economic\ngrowth and poverty reduction. Within the agriculture sector, crop diversification is given high\npriority as a means to achieve those goals. The project is consistent with and supportive of\nADB\u2019s strategy. The results will not only help the coconut farmers in 24 coconut-producing\ncommunities but also establish community models for poverty reduction that can be replicated\nnationwide in eight major coconut growing countries. The project will also achieve two cross-\ncutting benefits: empowering socioeconomically disadvantaged women and enabling coconut\nfarmers to conserve important coconut germplasm on-farm, thus significantly contributing to\nsustainable natural resource management.\nC. The Proposed Project\n1.  Objective\n9. The project will develop sustainable coconut-based, income-generating technologies for\nresource-poor rural communities in eight DMCs in the Asian and Pacific region: Bangladesh,\nIndia, Indonesia, Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam.\nThe  project  will  promote  the  production  and  marketing  of  high-value  coconut  products,\nintercropping and livestock/fodder production, and production and marketing of quality planting\nmaterials to deploy precious coconut diversity. The goal is to increase the real income and\npromote the food security of poor people in 24 coconut-based rural communities in the DMCs.\n10. The DMCs were selected on the basis of the coconut area planted and number of\ncoconut farmers (India, Indonesia, and Philippines having the biggest); willingness to share\nequipment  and  technologies  (India,  Philippines,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Viet  Nam);  prospects  for\ndeveloping bilateral investment projects (Bangladesh, Viet Nam, and PNG); and willingness to\nconduct research for possible application in fragile Pacific atoll islands (Fiji Islands) through the\nsupport of a regional organization (Secretariat of the Pacific Community in Fiji). The atoll islands\n(parts  of  Fiji  Islands,  PNG,  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  French  Polynesia,  New\nCaledonia, and Tonga; and significant parts of Cook Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, and\nTuvalu) represent a special challenge for agricultural development. The atoll islands suffer from\npoor economic development and extreme isolation. They also have a fragile ecosystem \u2013 with\nhigh water salinity and low nitrogen content, and high temperatures \u2013 where coconut is one of\nthe few crops grown. They are also prone to typhoons. Dwarf varieties with high-value tender\nnuts need to be identified and introduced.\n2. Scope\n11. The TA has five components: (i) build capacity through training and development of\ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs), farmers, women\u2019s groups, and research and extension\nofficers; (ii) develop simple equipment for production and marketing of high-value products,\ninvolving  CBOs,  NGOs,  and  women\u2019s  groups;  (iii)  develop  viable  intercropping  and\nlivestock/fodder production technologies; (iv) develop community-managed coconut nurseries,\nand  deploy  and  conserve  promising  selected  local  and  introduced  coconut  varieties;  and\n(v) disseminate and promote research results. The technical assistance framework is in Table\nA4.1.\n12. The  expected  major  outputs  are  (i)  trained  CBO  members  and  leaders  capable  of\nmanaging business enterprises, and researchers and extension workers capable of supporting\nand replicating sustainable community-based income-generating activities and development\nefforts; (ii) efficient inexpensive equipment for producing high-value products developed and", "38 Appendix 4, page 4\nadopted; (iii) market surveys completed and new and larger consumer markets for coconut\nproducts  identified;  (iv)  viable  postproduction  techniques  for  producing  high-value  quality\nproducts adopted; (v) viable intercropping and livestock/fodder production techniques adopted;\n(vi) profitable community nurseries and successful deployment and on-farm conservation of\nimportant  coconut  varieties;  (vii)  viable  women\u2019s  groups  formed  and  involved  in  income-\ngenerating activities; and (viii) new on-farm and off-farm technologies utilizing various parts of\nthe coconut\u2014from the wood, leaves, husks, kernel, and shell\u2014disseminated and promoted for\npotential replication nationwide.\n3.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The  total  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $3.0  million  equivalent,  including\ncontingencies. It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $1.0 million (about 33 percent of the\ntotal cost) from the ADB-funded TA Program. IPGRI will provide $666,000 (22 percent) while\nNARSs will provide about $1.1 million equivalent (about 35 percent), mostly in-kind contribution\nthrough local staff, office, and training facilities. IFAD will provide $150,000 (5 percent) to\ncofinance  activities  in  India,  Indonesia,  and  Philippines.  The  Department  for  International\nDevelopment (DFID) of the United Kingdom will provide about $112,000 (4 percent) to select\nand characterize 24 rural communities and to refine the embryo culture technology to be used\nfor  the  safe  movement  of  germplasm  between  countries.  The  International  Development\nResearch Centre of Canada (IDRC) will contribute about $12,000 (about 0.4 percent) equivalent\nto support feasibility and impact studies and to document viable high-value products (Table\nA4.2).\n4.  Implementation Arrangements\n14. IPGRI,  which  performed  satisfactorily  in  implementing  two  completed  ADB-financed\nprojects, will serve as the Executing Agency (EA). The NARSs, in collaboration with their\ncounterparts in the agricultural extension service, will be the Implementing Agencies (IAs) for\nthe study (Table A4.3). For continuity, IPGRI will assign the same internationally recruited\nproject coordinator to coordinate the study. Each participating NARS will designate a national\nproject manager to implement the study, prepare reports, and conduct the feasibility and impact\nsurveys. The project will also link with the ADB-assisted investment projects, such as the\nNorthwest Bangladesh Crop Diversification Project and Sri Lanka\u2019s Southern Province Rural\nEconomic Advancement Project to promote project complementation and synergy.\n15. The project will be implemented over three years beginning on 1 January 2002. IPGRI\nwill  procure  the  services  of  locally  recruited  staff  comprising  one  scientific  assistant,  one\ncommunication assistant, and one training assistant, to help the IPGRI team to plan, monitor,\nand analyze research data; and prepare progress reports and extension materials, bulletins,\nand a newsletter. They will also assist in developing the training curriculum, training modules\nand training materials; and in conducting training courses in eight participating countries.\n16. The services of short-term specialists will be required in developing and strengthening\nCBOs, NGOs, and women\u2019s groups; training in the participatory approach and cooperatives\u2019\nactivities; introducing simple implements and equipment for producing high-value handicrafts\nand  food  processing;  introducing  intercropping  and  livestock-fodder  practices;  and  making\nsimple financial rate of return analysis. IPGRI will collaborate with Indonesia\u2019s Central Research\nInstitute for Agricultural Socioeconomic in training communities on the participatory approach.", "39 Appendix 4, page 5\n17. The IAs will select 24 coconut-based communities (three communities per country) as\ntarget  study  sites  representing  different  agroclimatic  conditions  (dry,  medium,  wet),\nsocioeconomic  conditions  (prevalence  of  poor  people  living  below  the  poverty  line),  and\ncommunity commitment to join the study. CBOs and women\u2019s groups will be organized and\ntrained to manage viable village-level handicraft and coconut seedling nursery enterprises.\nMembers of the CBOs will be encouraged to mobilize savings to raise capital and will be given a\none-time grant of planting materials, small livestock, simple tools and equipment for handicraft\nmaking. Inexpensive processing equipment for producing high-value products will be introduced\nfrom Thailand and Viet Nam and, where suitable, the equipment will be modified and multiplied\nlocally in collaboration with the private sector.\n18. The IAs and IPGRI team will train researchers, extension technicians and farmers on the\ntechniques  of  producing  high-value  coconut  handicraft  products,  intercropping  and\nlivestock/fodder  production,  and  establishing  coconut  seedling  nurseries.  For  the  livestock\ncomponent, the project will collaborate with the ongoing projects of the International Livestock\nResearch Institute and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture supported by ADB, on\nusing the three-tier system of fodder production involving cash crops, grasses, and shrubs and\ntrees. Since Bangladesh and Viet Nam plan to expand their coconut production and their\ncoconut  research  programs,  they  have  requested  that  ADB  support  two  scholarships  for\nadvanced degrees. Additional scholarships will be sought from the Southeast Asian Research\nCenter for Agriculture (SEARCA) to support six masters degree awardees from the participating\ncountries.\n19. Community-managed  coconut  seedling  nurseries  will  be  established  to  produce\nseedlings for sale to community members and nearby population centers. Participants will be\nencouraged to plant at least 10 coconut seedlings around their homes.  The seedlings will be\nderived from selected local and introduced varieties, which have potential for high yield and\nhigh-value products, and are suited to high saline conditions on island atolls. This activity will\nserve as a twin mechanism for income generation and for deploying coconut diversity and\npromoting its on-farm conservation through use. IPGRI will regularly monitor the impact of\nintroducing improved technology on the island atolls.\n20. Each IA will conduct a survey to identify marketable products that will be produced for\nspecific markets. Marketing will involve the traditional and new local, national and regional\nmarket channels and new opportunities such as electronic-marketing will be explored, initially in\ncollaboration with the IDRC Singapore-managed Pan Asia E-Commerce Mall.\n21. IPGRI will organize and conduct three workshops and will submit the following reports to\nADB: (i) semiannual progress reports, (ii) semiannual financial statements accounting for the\nuse of project funds, and (iii) an annual audited financial statement. Funds will be drawn down in\nsemiannual installments based on IPGRI\u2019s estimate of the forthcoming six-month expenditures,\nand  ADB  will  disburse  TA  funds  for  the  project  subject  to  satisfactory  liquidation  of  past\nexpenditures.  IPGRI  will  procure  goods  and  services  and  recruit  short-term  specialists  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nas appropriate, or through other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Within three months of\ncompletion, IPGRI will submit to ADB a comprehensive project completion report.\n22. At ADB, the project will be assigned to a project officer from the Agriculture and Rural\nDevelopment  Division  (West)  with  appropriate  technical  expertise.  The  project  officer  will\nmonitor the progress of the work and conduct reviews as appropriate.", "40 Appendix 4, page 6\nTable A4.1: Technical Assistance Framework,\nInternational Plant Genetic Resources Institute\nProject Monitoring\nDesign Summary Targets Risks/Assumptions\nMechanism\nA.

Introduction\n1.  In  1998,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical  assistance  to  the\nInternational Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and six ADB developing member countries (DMCs)\nfor a research project entitled Development and Use of Hybrid Rice in Asia.1 The project, which\nwill be completed in December 2001, has achieved the objectives of strengthening human\nresources  in  six  national  agricultural  research  systems  (NARSs)  for  applied  research,\nestablishing collaborative research linkages through the hybrid rice network, and conducting\ngoal-oriented research programs. The project also succeeded in developing human resources in\nhybrid  rice  seed  production  and  strengthening  collaboration  between  research  and  seed\nindustry in the six countries.\n2.  With success in substantially increasing the area planted to hybrid rice to about 200,000\nhectares  (ha)  in  several  countries  between  1998  and  2000,  the  DMCs  requested  ADB  to\nsupport a follow-up project\u2014Sustaining Food Security in Asia Through the Development of\nHybrid Rice Technology. The NARSs would like to build on the success of their international\ncollaborative research and seek to address several constraints hampering the expansion of\nhybrid rice areas and hybrid rice seed production in the DMCs.\nB.   Background and Rationale\n3.  Rice is the staple food of about three billion people in Asia, where the population is\nestimated to be increasing by 80 million-100 million a year. Rice is critical to the region\u2019s poor\npeople, since about 90 percent of the world\u2019s rice supply is consumed by those who produce it.\nMost of these farmers are heads of resource-poor families.\n4.  With the high-yielding semidwarf rice varieties developed by IRRI in partnership with the\nNARSs, most rice-growing countries in Asia have done well in meeting their own rice needs in\nthe past 30 years. However, the future poses a major challenge since it has been estimated that\nby 2030 the world will have to produce 60 percent more rice than it did in 1995 to satisfy the\ndemand from increasing populations. One major strategy is to meet this challenge through\nhybrid  rice,  which  has  the  potential  to  increase  yields  beyond  the  levels  for  high-yielding\nsemidwarf rices.\n5.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has for a long time produced hybrid rice in\nsubtropical and temperate regions. In the PRC, hybrid rice is currently cultivated on about 15\nmillion ha, yielding about 102 million metric tons (t) of paddy or 17 percent of the world\u2019s paddy\nproduction, whereas commercial inbred rice, occupying about the same area, yields only 81\nmillion t of paddy, or about 80 percent compared with hybrid rice. Hybrid rice technology has\nhelped the PRC and the world increase rice production by about 20 million t annually. The\ntechnology has demonstrated its role in promoting global food security. Because of increased\nyields, hybrid rice farmers can have higher income than farmers cultivating commercial rice\ncultivars. Similarly, hybrid rice seed producers can have higher incomes than seed producers of\ncommercial varieties because of the higher returns from hybrid seeds. Moreover, since hybrid\n                  \n1  TA 5766-REG, for $1.5 million, approved on 29 December 1997.", "46 Appendix 5, page 2\nrice production involves labor-intensive production, processing, and marketing of hybrid seeds\nevery  crop  season,  it  results  in  more  employment  in  the  rural  areas.  Such  employment\nopportunities will mostly benefit women, who are most likely to be involved in the meticulous\nproduction of hybrid seed. Finally, hybrid rice technology helps protect the environment. Had the\nPRC not developed and used hybrid rice technology, the world would have required 6 million ha\nmore to cultivate to attain the current production level.\n6.  Unfortunately, the hybrid rice that achieved rapid success in the PRC was unsuitable for\ntropical farming and its grain quality was regarded as poor. Work at IRRI to develop and\npromote the spread of hybrid rice in tropical Asia started in 1979. Actual testing of promising\nhybrid  rice  lines  with  tropical  rice  parentage,  developed  by  IRRI  and  six  Asian  countries\n(Bangladesh,  India,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Viet  Nam),  began  after  ADB\napproved the ongoing hybrid rice project. Achievements under the ongoing project (1998-2001)\nincluded (i) the establishment of an effective international hybrid rice network comprising of six\nmember countries and the PRC, and three collaborating institutions: IRRI, Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO), and Asia-Pacific Seed Association (APSA); (ii) development of human\nresources in six member countries after 64 researchers received specialized training in hybrid\nrice breeding and hybrid seed production at IRRI, the PRC, and India, and after more than\n3,000 private and nongovernment organization (NGO) seed growers, extension workers, and\nprogressive farmers were trained on cultivation of parental lines to produce hybrid seeds for\ncommercial distribution; (iii) identification of dozens of promising hybrids from IRRI and NARSs\nmaterials, and release of four hybrids for commercial production in India, Philippines, and Viet\nNam;2 and (iv) establishment of a separate Coordinated International Hybrid Rice Yield Trials in\n1999 in 22 locations in six countries in which 20 promising materials developed at IRRI and\nmember countries were evaluated.\n7.  Other  achievements  under  the  project  include  (i)  increase  in  the  number  of  seed\nenterprises involved in hybrid seed production to 30, or 15 more than those in operation in 1998,\nrepresenting public, private, and NGO firms; (ii) increase in hybrid seed yields of up to 2.5 t/ha,\ncompared with the seed yield economic threshold of only 1.5 t/ha in the project area and\nbenchmark seed yield of 2.8 t/ha in the PRC; (iii) 15-20 percent yield advantage of hybrid rice\nover popular high-yielding varieties in farmers\u2019 fields; and (iv) expansion in area planted to\nhybrid rice of up to 200,000 ha: from 280,000 ha in 1998 to 480,000 ha in 2000 in Bangladesh,\nIndia, Philippines, and Viet Nam.\n8.  Several constraints affecting the rapid development and dissemination of hybrid rice\ntechnology in tropical Asia have been identified. The grain quality and pest resistance of new\nrice hybrids need to be improved to match those of the high-yielding varieties, through improved\nagronomic practices. The technology for producing hybrid seeds needs refinements, which can\nbe  addressed  by  research  and  collaboration  among  the  seed  industry  players.  National\nbreeding  centers  can  address  the  inadequate  supply  of  seeds  of  parental  lines  used  for\nproducing hybrid seeds. Flowering of male and female parents is still poorly synchronized and\nthe  cost  of  a  growth  regulator  (gibberellic  acid)  required  in  hybrid  seed  production  is  still\nprohibitive. Finally, there is a need to intensify dialogue with policy makers of network member\ncountries to strengthen their commitments, policy, and financial support to promote hybrid rice\nresearch and development. Considering the achievements made and the technical and policy\nconstraints identified while implementing the ongoing project, the participating DMCs requested\nADB for a follow-up project seeking to increase the number of trained hybrid rice breeders to\naddress the agronomic and policy constraints affecting the full development and dissemination\n                  \n2  Two hybrids in India (Sahaydiri and CORH 2), and one each in Philippines (Mestizo) and Vet Nam (HYT 57).", "47 Appendix 5, page 3\nof  hybrid  rice  technology;  to  hasten  the  spread  and  transfer  of  technology  to  more  seed\nenterprise workers, extension workers, and rice farmers; and to intensify dialogue with policy\nmakers for required government support for rapid dissemination of hybrid rice technology to\nincrease rice production and sustain food security among the member countries.\n9.  The project will address the strategic concerns expressed in the ADB\u2019s new Long-term\nStrategic Framework, which focuses on economic growth, environmental conservation, human\nresources  development,  and  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction.  The  project  is  also\nconsistent with ADB\u2019s agriculture and natural resources research policy.3\nC.  The Proposed Project\n1.  Objectives\n10. The  objectives  are  to  (i)  strengthen  the  capabilities  of  researchers  and  extension\nworkers in nine DMC countries4 by providing specialized training, according to the specific\nneeds  of  each  country,  for  the  developing  and  disseminating  hybrid  rice  technology;\n(ii) strengthen the capabilities of private, public, and NGO-based seed enterprises by providing\nspecialized training in hybrid seed production and marketing;5 and (iii) strengthen Government\ncommitments, policy, and financial support to promote hybrid rice research and development\nthrough formal dialogues with policy makers. The goal of the project is to sustain food security\nthrough increased rice production in nine participating DMCs.\n2.  Scope\n11. The project has seven components: (i) expand and sustain the effective operation of the\ncollaborative hybrid rice network in nine member countries; (ii) conduct training for researchers\nand  extension  workers  on  varietal  improvement,  agronomic  trials  in  farmers\u2019  fields,  and\ndissemination of hybrid rice technology; (iii) conduct training for private, public, NGO, and\nfarmer  cooperatives  on  commercial  hybrid  seed  multiplication  and  marketing;  (iv)  conduct\napplied and strategic research to improve and sustain the performance of hybrid rice materials;\n(v) expand areas planted to hybrid rice by selecting suitable locations in which to disseminate\nthe mature hybrid rice technology; (vi) conduct socioeconomic studies to measure the impact of\nhybrid rice technology on target beneficiaries; and (vii) conduct studies to identify major policy\nconstraints affecting Government support for development and dissemination of hybrid rice\ntechnology  in  four  network  member  countries.  The  technical  assistance  framework  is  in\nTable A5.1.\n3. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12.  The total cost of the proposed project, including contingencies, is estimated at $2.83\nmillion equivalent. It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $1.0 million from the ADB-funded\n                  \n3  R 253-95: The Bank\u2019s Policy on Agriculture and Natural Resources Research, 29 November 1995.\n4 Under the proposed TA, all the original six DMCs (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet\nNam) and three new ones (Republic of Korea, Myanmar, and Thailand) have been selected. Countries were\nselected on the basis of these criteria: (i) strong rice improvement programs, (ii) commitment to sustain food\nsecurity by increasing rice production through hybrid rice technology by expanding the area planted to hybrid rice\nby 2005, (iii) willingness to commit teams of researchers and extension workers and resources to develop and\ndisseminate hybrid rice technology, and (iv) willingness to dialogue to strengthen policy, staff, and financial\nresources to develop hybrid rice technology.\n5  Seed enterprises will be strengthened in eight countries, excluding the Republic of Korea.", "48 Appendix 5, page 4\nTA Program to finance about 35 percent of the total cost of the study. The remaining 65 percent\nbe financed by IRRI ($470,000 or 17 percent of the total cost), FAO ($360,000 or 13 percent),\nAPSA ($110,000 or 4 percent), and NARSs ($890,000 equivalent or 31 percent). NARSs will\nprovide mostly in-kind contribution and expenses in conducting research work, procuring small\nequipment, and local training. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Table A5.2.\n4. Implementation Arrangements\n13.  IRRI,  which  implemented  the  ongoing  project  in  a  highly  satisfactory  manner,  will\ncontinue to serve as the Executing Agency for the project. It will administer and coordinate the\nproject through its headquarters in Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines. IRRI will continue to provide the\nservices  of  its  senior  rice  breeder  as  coordinator,  and  will  engage  the  services  of  an\nexperienced project manager to manage the day-to-day implementation of the project.\n14.  FAO will complement the activities of the project through its ongoing programs in India\nand Indonesia, and possibly a new assistance program in Sri Lanka, aimed at strengthening the\ncapabilities  of  researchers  in  these  countries  in  conducting  research,  improving  seed\nmultiplication, and transfer of technology. IRRI and FAO will jointly conduct dialogue with policy\nmakers  (para.  16).  APSA  will  continue  to  lead  the  special  interest  group  on  hybrid  rice,\nestablished two years ago under the ongoing project to facilitate cooperation among public and\nprivate sector seed companies, and NGO-based and farmer cooperative seed enterprises.\nAPSA will also organize and coordinate the Coordinated International Hybrid Rice Yield Trials in\ncooperation with Thailand\u2019s national rice program. The arrangement will allow the participation\nof private sector companies and testing of their promising hybrid rice in the trial. Top hybrid rice\nexperts from the PRC will collaborate with IRRI and leading researchers from member countries\nin conducting strategic research. The PRC will also provide experts to serve as trainers in the\nproposed project and provide its training facilities as in the arrangements under the ongoing\nproject.\n15.  Nine  ADB  DMCs  will  participate  in  the  project:  the  original  six  member  countries\n(Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) and three new member\ncountries  (Republic  of  Korea,  Myanmar,  and  Thailand).  The  Implementing  Agencies  and\ncollaborators  are  listed  in  Table  A5.3.  Four  countries  (India,  Viet  Nam,  Bangladesh,  and\nPhilippines) lead the others in commercialization of hybrid rice technology.6 The rest of the\nmembers are still in the research and development phase. However, a technical committee\ncomprising representatives of the nine countries, IRRI, FAO, and APSA will be established at\nthe beginning of the implementation of the project to review, monitor, and evaluate the progress\nmade and to provide guidance and coordination. The project will be represented in the steering\ncommittee and the ad hoc technical advisory committee of IRRI\u2019s Irrigated Rice Research\nConsortium. This arrangement will reduce transaction costs and will allow close interaction with\nother groups under the consortium working on nutrients, water, and pest management in rice.\nEach  country  will  establish  a  team  of  two  specialists,  comprising  one  hybrid  rice  breeder\n(country  coordinator)  and  one  extension  specialist  (member)  to  provide  direction  to\nimplementation of the study. The project will also link with the ADB-assisted Grains Sector\nDevelopment Program in the Philippines to promote project complementation and strategy.\n                  \n6 Four countries have programmed to expand the area planted to hybrid rice from 490,000 hectares (ha) to 1.85\nmillion ha by 2005. They are India (from 180,000 ha to 1.0 million ha), Viet Nam (280,000 ha to 0.5 million ha),\nBangladesh (28,000 ha to 200,000 ha), and Philippines (2,000 ha to 150,000 ha). Five countries also plan to\nexpand its hybrid rice areas from 5,000 ha to 80,000 ha by 2005: Myanmar (from 5,000 ha to 50,000 ha), Indonesia\nand Sri Lanka (nil to 10,000 ha each), and Thailand and Republic of Korea (nil to 5,000 ha each).", "49 Appendix 5, page 5\n16.  The project will be implemented over three years (2002-2004). The inaugural annual\nworkshop  will  be  held  at  the  beginning  of  the  first  year  to  introduce  the  goal,  objectives,\nstrategies and work plan, and to set directions and priorities. During this meeting, senior policy\nmakers from each member country will be invited to a dialogue to strengthen Government\ncommitments,  and  policy  and  financial  support  to  their  national  hybrid  rice  program.  The\nsucceeding annual meetings will take place at the beginning of the second and third years and\nassess the progress made and determine the work programs for the succeeding years. IRRI will\nsubmit to ADB semiannual progress reports, semiannual financial statements accounting for the\nuse of the TA funds, and the audited annual financial statements. Funds will be drawn down\nevery six months based on the estimated expenditures for each ensuing six-month period and\nsubject to satisfactory liquidation of expenditures financed under previously disbursed funds.\nIRRI will submit to the ADB a comprehensive project completion report within three months after\ncompletion of the project. IRRI will conduct socioeconomic surveys to determine the impact of\nhybrid rice technology to beneficiaries and will incorporate the results and other lessons learned\nin the project completion report. IRRI will be responsible for engaging consultants in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, or through other arrangements satisfactory to\nADB for engaging domestic consultants. IRRI will procure laboratory equipment in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n17.  At ADB, the project will be assigned to a project officer from the Agriculture and Social\nSectors  Department  (East)  with  appropriate  expertise.  The  project  officer  will  monitor  the\nprogress of implementation of the project and will conduct reviews as appropriate.", "50 Appendix 5, page 6\nTable A5.1: Technical Assistance Framework,\nInternational Rice Research Institute\nDesign Summary Targets Project Monitoring Risks/Assumptions\nMechanisms\nA.
