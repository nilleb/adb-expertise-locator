INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) attempts to facilitate and integrate \nthe development of strategic knowledge on infrastructure in the region, both inside and outside \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA will focus on three important areas: (i) creating \nknowledge products that focus on strategic issues regarding infrastructure and its financing \nmodality; (ii) integrating infrastructure knowledge products in the region through a publication \nentitled  Asia  Infrastructure  Insights,  and  convening  of  regular  consultation  workshops  and \nknowledge-dissemination  events;  and  (iii)  contributing  to  the  development  of  methods  for \ncompiling data on infrastructure investments and their financing, and enhancing the availability of \ndata required for policy analysis on infrastructure. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the ADB Management-approved annual work program of the ADB \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD), and is aligned with the three \nwork areas identified in its work plan for 2017:1 (i) improve research quality, so as to be the leading \nsource of knowledge on Asian development, regionally and globally; (ii) add value to ADB \noperations departments2 to enable them to become more responsive to client needs, and \ncontribute to ADB knowledge solutions under the \u201cone ADB\u201d approach; and (iii) establish strong \nlinks with global and regional centers of excellence for research on critical development issues of \nrelevance to Asia and the Pacific.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Asia and Pacific region faces both a huge infrastructure investment gap, and high \ndemand for knowledge on infrastructure, as discussed in the ADB Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure \nNeeds report.3 Policy dialogue with key stakeholders in the region during dissemination of the \nreport revealed the large demand for knowledge on infrastructure to support necessary policy \nchanges needed to close the infrastructure gap. Areas identified include innovative infrastructure \nfinancing, such as the increased role of bond (green) financing and land capture; high technology; \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs); guarantees; insurance; and sector best practices in the region. \nThe existence of unmitigated risk factors is considered to be a key reason for the lack of investor \ninterest in infrastructure. Institutional investors have strong and increased interest in financing \ninfrastructure in the region, but some significant constraints need to be addressed. Land-capture \nfinancing is a viable option to ease the government\u2019s fiscal constraints for selected infrastructure. \nThere is strong interest from government stakeholders in the region regarding high-technology \ninfrastructure, but a significant knowledge gap exists regarding the long-term benefits. While \nPPPs are being used in many countries in the region, the progress of developing PPPs remains \nrelatively slow. ADB and other stakeholders have attempted to develop best practices across \nsectors, but knowledge generated from such operations is scattered, and not always published. \n \n4.  A recent ADB study on the drivers of growth in middle-income countries finds that \ninfrastructure investments and capital will play a major role in transcending middle-income status.4 \nFor developing countries in Asia, the infrastructure investment gap (i.e., the difference between \ninvestment needs and current investment levels) is equivalent to 2.4% of the projected gross \ndomestic product from 2016 to 2020 (footnote 2). Traditional public resources for infrastructure \ninvestment have proven to be inadequate. More investments are needed in electricity, transport, \ntelecommunication, and water and sanitation. Public sources comprise 92% of infrastructure \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 October 2017. \n2  The strategic studies produced under the TA will inform the preparation of Country Partnership Strategies of ADB\u2019s \nDMCs and ADB projects in infrastructure. \n3  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2017. Asian Development Outlook: Transcending the Middle-Income Challenge. Manila. \n ", "2   \ninvestments in the region, but, in many countries they are unlikely to meet even 50% of the \ninfrastructure gap between investment needs and current investment levels. \n \n5.  With  limited  fiscal  space  and  increased  spending  needs  for  health  and  education, \nexpanding alternative nongovernment sources of infrastructure financing is imperative if the \nregion is to achieve its infrastructure development target. To help meet the region\u2019s need for \ninfrastructure financing, ADB will increase its operations to $20 billion annually by 2020. Most \nprivate sector financing of infrastructure currently uses bank financing\u2014bond markets are at an \nearly  stage  of  development  in  many  ADB  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),  and  the \ncomplementarity between banking and bond financing has not been widely utilized. At many \nforums, large investors in developed countries have expressed interest in financing infrastructure \ndevelopment in the region, but the actual infrastructure investments financed from this source \nhave remained limited because of various constraints. Some countries have made good progress \nin reforming their regulatory framework to enable PPP financing, but results to date are very \nmodest. Stakeholders in many DMCs are keen to explore innovative infrastructure financing \nalternatives to increase the role of the private sector, using modalities such as green bonds, land \nvalue capture, and take-out financing. In this context, policymakers have expressed the need for \nknowledge support to facilitate informed dialogue as they seek to develop enabling policies to \nincrease  private  sector  infrastructure  and  green  financing,  and  develop  other  innovative \napproaches to meet various infrastructure needs. \n \n6.  Adoption of high-level technology (HLT) will help maximize the development impact of \ninfrastructure by facilitating a transition to low emission and climate-resilient growth. Appropriate \nHLT could also improve the functionality and efficiency of infrastructure and reduce its lifetime \ncosts. DMCs have shown strong interest in HLT, and ADB has championed its application in its \noperations. Knowledge support to demonstrate the long-term benefits of HLT and to expand its \nadoption in various sectors, however, are still in an early stage of development. \n \n7.  ADB has strived to develop sector best practice in its infrastructure operations in various \nsectors. However, much of the tacit and explicit knowledge produced in these operations is not \npublished. Published materials are scattered and tend to be disseminated in a low-profile manner. \nSelected infrastructure stakeholders in the region have also published their experience, but its \nreach  to  policy  makers  has  been  limited.  Development  and  integration  of  these  scattered \ninfrastructure knowledge products into a flagship regional publication would facilitate regional \nknowledge sharing to enhance policy dialogue, inform development of enabling policies, and \naccelerate adoption of HLT and new financing modalities for infrastructure. This is in line with the \nobjectives of the ADB Knowledge Framework for Strategy 2030, which seeks to make ADB a \nmajor facilitator of tacit and explicit knowledge in the region. \n \n8.  As noted in Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs (footnote 2), data on actual infrastructure \ninvestments undertaken by countries is surprisingly scarce. Investments in infrastructure are \nundertaken by different entities, including national and subnational governments, state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs),  and  the  private  sector.  Governments  do  not  typically  publish  data  on \naggregate infrastructure investments, and there is no single way or international best practice \napproach to measure it. However, sufficiently disaggregated data on gross fixed capital formation \n(GFCF) from countries\u2019 national accounts statistics presents a possible approach (footnote 2). In \nthis context, a methodological exercise conducted jointly with national accounts statisticians and \nbudget experts from selected DMCs is required to prepare a set of easy-to-implement guidelines \nfor measuring infrastructure investments more consistently across countries and over time than \nis  currently  possible.  Moreover,  coordination  with  similar  efforts  being  undertaken  in  other \ndeveloping regions by the World Bank (for Africa) and Inter-American Development Bank (for \n ", "                                3 \nLatin America) could lead to the development of a global database on infrastructure investments \nby developing countries.5 In conjunction with existing databases on infrastructure investments \nand stocks, such a database, guided by principles and methodologies of open access, including \nbulk data and common data standards, would be very useful in undertaking policy analysis of \ninfrastructure-related issues. The TA will also contribute to the creation of an infrastructure finance \ndatabase. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  better-informed  policy  making  on \ninfrastructure and its financing made, and (ii) innovative financing modality for infrastructure \nmainstreamed. The TA will have the following outcome: enhanced knowledge base and policy \ndialogue on infrastructure policies in Asia and the Pacific.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n10.  Output  1:  Knowledge  products  on  infrastructure  and  its  financing  modality \npublished. Create and publish policy-based knowledge products, focusing on strategic issues on \ninfrastructure and its financing modalities. For the first stage\u2014based on consultation with DMC \nofficials, sector and thematic working groups, the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP), \nPrivate Sector Operations Department (PSOD), and regional departments\u2014the TA will support \nnew strategic studies on selected infrastructure issues, including on HLT; innovative infrastructure \nfinancing, including subnational infrastructure finance; and other policy enablers to accelerate \ninfrastructure development in the region. For the subsequent publication, in the spirit of \u201cone ADB\u201d, \nERCD  will  consult  with  sector  and  thematic  working  groups,  OPPP,  PSOD,  and  regional \ndepartments on the topics to be studied under the TA. \n \n11.  Output 2: Asia Infrastructure Insights published. To maximize knowledge-sharing and \nenhance policy dialogue in infrastructure development in the region, the TA will support the digital \nand hard copy publication of selected strategic studies, including those produced under output 1; \nsector  good  practices,  as  developed  by  ADB  in  its  operations  and  by  other  infrastructure \nstakeholders; and the findings of impact evaluation studies produced by ADB. ERCD will host \nconsultation workshops and undertake capacity building to present and discuss papers on the \nstrategic studies and selected sector good practice to policy makers, academics, and international \nfinancial institutions. Through consultation, the TA will build and expand the knowledge base for \ngood  practice  in  infrastructure  project  implementation  and  innovative  ways  to  finance \ninfrastructure.  Once  the  TA  successfully  completes  the  first  few  annual  issues  of  Asia \nInfrastructure Insights, ERCD will process a new cluster TA to support regular publication of Asia \nInfrastructure Insights. \n \n12.  Output 3: Pilot studies and guidelines on measuring infrastructure investments and \ntheir financing conducted. Under output 3 the TA will conduct pilot methodological research, \nand develop guidelines for measurement of infrastructure investments. If possible, the TA will \ndevelop a database of infrastructure and infrastructure financing. By conducting methodological \nresearch and developing guidelines, the TA will contribute to a planned global database on \ninfrastructure investments and their financing. A preliminary assessment described in Meeting \nAsia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs (footnote 2) indicates that disaggregated data on GFCF recorded in \n                                                \n5  Preliminary discussions with the World Bank have been held on their planned initiative to develop a global database \nof infrastructure spending across at least 70 countries in collaboration with ADB and other interested partners. \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4   \nnational income accounts may enable better and comparable measurement of infrastructure \ninvestments, both across countries as well as by sector and possibly by institution (i.e., general \ngovernment, SOEs, and private corporate sector). One components of the proposed infrastructure \nTA will assess the current GFCF methodology in national accounts of selected countries and use \na pilot exercise to further develop a methodology for measuring infrastructure investments. The \npilot exercise results will be discussed with DMCs and international agencies known to be working \non improving infrastructure investment measures, including the Inter-American Development \nBank  and  the  World  Bank.  Where  feasible,  ADB  will  contribute  to  a  global  database  of \ninfrastructure investments being planned by the World Bank. The TA will also develop a database \nfor public sector, private sector, and SOE infrastructure financing, and  provide capacity building \nto implement the database in 5\u201310 participating DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \n14.  The participating DMC governments will provide counterpart support in the form of access \nto official databases and database documents, assistance in data collection and provision of \ncounterpart research staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. ERCD will form a working group comprising representatives \nfrom ERCD, the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department, OPPP, PSOD, and \nregional departments to guide the implementation of the TA. The working group will select the \ntopic of strategic infrastructure studies to support ADB operations and policy discussions on \ninfrastructure in the region. ERCD will also appoint on an ad hoc basis an external panel with \nvaried expertise regarding the selected topic to guide specific strategic infrastructure studies to \nbe covered by the TA.7 An external panel will be engaged as consultants and/or resource persons. \nTimeliness and topicality are among the criteria for selecting the topics. Participating DMCs will \nbe determined by the respective working group through consultations with stakeholders. \n \n16.  Knowledge partnerships8. Experience gained through other knowledge and support TA \nprojects have demonstrated significant value addition from collaboration with universities, think \ntanks, research institutions, and centers of excellence in producing studies of good quality and \nfacilitating exchange of information. Various forms of collaboration will be considered including \nexchange  of  knowledge,  participation  of  resource  persons  in  consultation  workshops,  co-\norganization of workshops and dissemination activities, and contribution of background papers. \nThe suitable institution to be nominated as a knowledge partner will have localized expertise on \nan identified topic of study, technical knowhow, a proven record of publishing good quality \nresearch on the study area, and the ability to conduct the study and organize workshops and \nknowledge-dissemination activities. \n \n \n                                                \n7  The external panel provides overall guidance in the conduct of the research. \n8  Knowledge partnerships will be conducted in accordance with the Staff Instruction on Business Processes for \nKnowledge Partnerships under Technical Assistance Operations issued on 2 March 2017. \n ", "                                5 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  November 2017\u2013December 2020 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, Office of Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership, Private Sector Operations Department, regional \ndepartments, and Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultants selection  42 person-months  $561,000.0 \n(international consultants) \nIndividual consultants selection  24 person-months  $141,000.0 \n(national consultants) \nProcurement  To be procured by ADB \nCompetitive selection and/or single- 3 contracts  $ 30,000.0 \nsource \nSurvey and administrative data and \nbig data \nShopping  2 contracts  $ 3,000.0 \nStatistical software \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n17.  Consulting services. The TA will require consulting services that will be provided by a \nnumber of international and national experts, including economists, infrastructure specialists, \nstatisticians,  resource  persons,  and  research  assistants  who  have  research  experience  in \ninfrastructure financing. The exact requirements for each type of expertise and the length of input \nwill  vary  according  to  the  area  and  scope  of  research  studies.  Economists,  infrastructure \nspecialists, and statisticians will be hired using individual consultant selection, on output-based, \nlump sum contracts with a provision for fixed out-of-pocket expenditures.
