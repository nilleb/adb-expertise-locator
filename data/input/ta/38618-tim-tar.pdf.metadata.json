The Government of Timor-Leste has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for preparing the proposed Road Network Development Project for \npossible ADB financing. Fact-finding was undertaken during 8\u201317 April 2008 to discuss and \nformulate the project preparatory TA. The Fact-Finding Mission reached agreement with the \nGovernment on the scope, cost estimates, financing, implementation arrangements, and terms \nof reference for the TA consultants. The TA1 is included in the country strategy and program \nupdate (2006\u20132008)2 and the country operations business plan (2008\u20132010)3 for Timor-Leste. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Timor-Leste has an extensive road network of about 6,000 km, half of which are rural \nroads that are currently undeveloped tracks. The core network comprises 1,400 km of national \nroads connecting the 13 districts and 900 km of district roads linking major population centers to \nthe national roads. The urban roads in major cities total about 700 km. About 80% (or 1,800 km) \nof core roads are paved. As the primary mode of transport carrying 70% of freight and 90% of \npassengers, roads play a vital role in the country\u2019s economic development and integration. \nRecognizing its importance, the Government is keen to develop the road network. During the \nconflict period, most of the road network, and in particular bridges, was damaged. The road \nconditions  further  deteriorated  since  the  country\u2019s  independence  in  2002  due  to  lack  of \nmaintenance. Early emergency efforts by ADB4 and other development partners were aimed at \nrestoring accessibility and focused on repairing only the damaged sections of the road network. \nThis improved Dili\u2019s connection with most of the country, but overall road conditions continued \nto worsen due to the Government\u2019s inability to meet the maintenance needs. This was further \ncompounded by rains and unstable geotechnical conditions in mountainous areas that cause \nfrequent landslides. The ongoing, ADB-financed Road  Sector  Improvement  Project (RSIP)5 \nreflects    the    initial    attempt    to    transition    from  emergency  work  to  sustainable  road \ndevelopment, as it includes rehabilitating longer stretches of roads as well as initiatives to test \nlabor-intensive maintenance methods, and community participation in developing rural roads. \n \n3.  The national road network consists of the northern and southern coastal road corridors \nand five north\u2013south roads connecting the two coastal roads. Dili, located on the northern \ncoastal road, is connected to the rest of the country through the national road network. The \ndistrict roads supplement the national network by extending it to other parts of the country and \nlinking major district administration centers. A detailed study of the road network in 20056 \nshowed that 44% of the paved roads and 89% of the unpaved roads are in poor condition. \nAlthough  some  road  rehabilitation  works  have  taken  place  since  then,  repairs  have  been \nlocalized and the overall condition of the network has not improved. In fact, information provided \nby the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) indicates that the relatively long rainy season this year \nhas caused major failures from subsidence and landslides on some road sections that has cut \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 April 2008. \n2  ADB. 2005.

An update of the 2005 study is needed to properly assess the \ncurrent road conditions and develop a pragmatic program to address road improvement needs. \n \n4.  Developing  and  managing  roads  are  among  MOI\u2019s  several  responsibilities. 7  Its \nDirectorate of Roads, Bridges and Flood Control (DRBFC) plans, develops, and maintains the \nroad infrastructure. This includes ensuring that the road network is not blocked by landslides or \nother failures and remains operational. DRBFC operates through five regional offices covering \nthe country\u2019s entire road network, but it is seriously handicapped by shortage of technical staff.8 \nThis  has  affected  DRBFC\u2019s  operational  capacity  for  strategic  planning,  procurement  and \nadministration of new infrastructure contracts, and ensuring timely maintenance of the road \nnetwork. MOI is keen to expand its capacity by engaging additional staff, but it is constrained by \nlimited availability of skilled human resources and better incentives offered by the private sector. \nAs a result, MOI is considering other alternatives such as outsourcing.  \n \n5.  Several initiatives to develop capacity of the existing MOI and DRBFC staff are either \ncomplete  or  ongoing.  Under  ADB-financed  TA,9 the  DRBFC\u2019s  mid-level  management  and \ntechnical staff are undergoing formal training in management and leadership, procurement and \ncontract  administration,  road  design,  construction,  maintenance,  materials  testing,  quality \ncontrol, and safety. Another ADB-supported TA,10 co-financed by the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development,  provides  MOI  long-term  and  short-term  advisers  for  hands-on \nassistance\u2014initially to support in procuring capital development projects and then in building \nlong term implementation capacity. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has completed \ntwo initiatives to build DRBFC\u2019s capacity in road maintenance and prepared technical manuals \nand guidelines for road asset management. This also involved training in the use of construction \nequipment. Under RSIP, the consultants are working on preparing a road maintenance manual \nusing labor-intensive methods. MOI accords high priority to building its capacity by continuing \nsuch capacity development programs.  \n \n6.  The rural roads network that connects towns and communities to the national and district \nroads and provides access to the rural population is not developed. There could be several \nreasons for this, including, but not limited to, lack of resources and misplaced priorities prior to \nindependence. It is recognized however that the rural population cannot contribute to economic \ndevelopment, unless it is provided access to markets and means of livelihood. Moreover, the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to provide health, education, and other social services, including justice, \nare  constrained  by  lack  of  access.  Preliminary  results  from  the  2007  update  of  the  2001 \nhousehold  income  and  expenditure  study  indicate  a  downward  trend  in  the  population\u2019s \naccessibility to vehicle-passable roads. By 2007, the accessibility had been reduced from 85% \nto 65%, and 40% of the rural population had no access. Moreover, travel time to the nearest \nschools  and  clinics  in  rural  areas  was  about  an  hour.11 The  community  empowerment \ncomponent under RSIP, involving communities\u2019 direct participation in developing access roads \nto population centers, has demonstrated a successful approach not only for developing rural \nroads but also for sustaining the infrastructure. This approach needs to be replicated and \nexpanded to other parts of the country to enhance accessibility to rural areas. Lessons can also \n                                                 \n7  MOI is responsible for transport (roads, airports, ports, and harbors), energy, and water supply infrastructure.   \n8  DRBFC has only 12 engineers: 7 in the headquarters in Dili and 5 in regional offices.  \n9  ADB. 2005.

Improving  the  road  network  alone  will  not  solve  the  connectivity  and  accessibility \nproblem unless road transport services are also improved. The bulk of passenger and freight \ntraffic uses public transport that is mostly privately-owned. The Government has passed laws \nand approved road codes to ensure a safe and clean transport system and to regulate the road \ntransport services. However, the public transport regulations are not effectively-enforced. Fares \nset by the Government are seldom used. The transporters determine fares based upon the \ncompetition on the routes. While fares are reasonable on some inter-urban routes, transporters \ngenerally charge very high fares for travel to rural areas. A survey conducted under the earlier \nADB study (footnote 6) showed that almost 90% of more than 100 transport operators surveyed \nwere providing poor quality of service. Improved road network and enforcement of regulations \nwill result in competitive fares and better transport services to rural areas.   \n \n8.  The Government is keen to create employment opportunities, as the unemployment rate \nhas gone up significantly particularly among the youth. In Dili, the overall unemployment rate is \nestimated at 23%, and for the youth it has increased to 40%.12 Thousands of young people join \nthe country\u2019s workforce every year. This situation is exacerbated by the presence of a large \npopulation  of  internally-displaced  persons.  One  approach  under  consideration  by  the \nGovernment  is  to  promote  labor-intensive  methods  for  public  works  to  enhance  income \ngeneration.  The  Government  also  plans  a  national  workforce  program  based  on  previous \nexperiences and to initiate a pilot activity. A labor-intensive project was implemented by the \nInternational Labour Organization in 2007 for infrastructure rehabilitation, and maintenance of \nrural infrastructure such as roads, bridges, drainage, irrigation, and biogas. An evaluation rated \nthe  project  as  successful  and  recommended  expanding  use  of  this  approach.  The  labor-\nintensive road maintenance component being implemented under RSIP can provide useful \nlessons.        \n \n9.  While MOI supports the labor-intensive approach for income generation and is cognizant \nthat the development partners are keen to incorporate it into their activities, it is also conscious \nof that approach\u2019s limitations. MOI is of the view that labor-intensive approaches are suitable for \ndeveloping  rural  roads  and  for  maintenance;  but  for  developing  infrastructure  of  national \nimportance, such as the national roads, international construction standards should be followed \nto ensure high quality. MOI has allocated $375,000 for labor-intensive rural road works in each \nof the 13 districts.13 This work is carried out in close coordination with the district administrations.     \n \n10.  The  country\u2019s  existing  National  Development  Plan 14  places  high  importance  on \ninfrastructure  development.  It  states  that,  \u201cInfrastructure  has  perhaps  the  strongest  cross-\nsectoral  implications  for  national  development.  Having  an  effective  system  of  physical \ninfrastructure and services is crucial for agricultural productivity and poverty reduction, but it is \nalso  a  key  determinant  of  business  investment,  is  vital  for  human  development,  and  the \nfoundation for private sector development.\u201d ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (2006\u20132008) \nidentified  transport  infrastructure  improvement  as  a  key  area  of  ADB  assistance.  Two \nemergency road improvement projects (footnote 4) have already been completed and a third \n                                                 \n12 Government of Timor-Leste 2008 National Priorities, prepared for 28\u201329 March 2008 Development Partners \nMeeting.  \n13 Based on a positive outcome, MOI may consider expanding this program by allocating an additional $300,000 per \ndistrict during the midterm review of the budget in June 2008. \n14 Created in 2002. A new National Development Plan is scheduled to be prepared in 2008. \n ", "4   \n(RSIP) is ongoing. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (2009\u20132013) that is under preparation \nsupports the earlier strategy and continues to focus on transport infrastructure development.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA will contribute to the Government\u2019s objective of an improved and sustainable \nroad  network  in  Timor-Leste.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  in  reducing  the  cost  of \ntransportation and improving the road network for economic development and social integration. \nThe TA will also assist MOI in preparing its national development plan for road infrastructure \nand identifying institutional and policy reforms needed to improve sector performance. This will \nbe achieved by (i) undertaking a detailed assessment of the road improvement needs, (ii) \npreparing  a  national  roads  improvement  program,  (iii)  preparing  a  labor-intensive  road \nmaintenance  program,  (iv)  preparing  a  community-participated  rural  roads  development \nprogram, and (v) institutional and capacity development of road infrastructure-related agencies \nunder MOI. The TA will assess the suitability of using a sector-wide approach for implementing \nthe proposed project or its components.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. First, it will update the transport sector \nimprovement study (footnote 6). This involves (i) verifying and completing the road inventory; (ii) \ncarrying  out  road  condition  surveys  to  assess  rehabilitation  and  improvement  needs;  (iii) \nassessing  the  existing  institutional  setup  for  roads,  including  the  contracting  industry,  (iv) \ndesigning  rehabilitation  and  improvement  strategies,  and  (v)  identifying  priority  roads  for \nimprovement. The findings of the first phase study will be presented to the Government and \nother stakeholders.  \n \n13.  Based on the responses received, the second phase of the TA will include (i) preliminary \ndesign and feasibility of the selected roads, (ii) a program for developing selected rural roads \nthrough  community  participation,  (iii)  developing  a  national  roads  maintenance  program \ninvolving  labor-intensive  approaches,  (iv)  identifying  institutional  and  capacity  development \nneeds  and  preparing  a  plan  for  implementation,  and  (v)  recommendations  for  improving \ntransport services to rural areas. The community-participated rural roads development and \nlabor-intensive road maintenance programs will be guided by the experiences and evaluation of \nthe ongoing activities under RSIP and other related initiatives by the development partners.          \n \n14.  All project roads identified under the second phase of the TA will be improved along with \ntheir  existing  alignments.  Therefore,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  insignificant. \nBased  on  initial  assessment  of  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  no  issues  involving \nindigenous people or adverse environmental impacts are expected. An initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. The TA will be implemented in close consultation with MOI and district \ngovernments,  and  it  will  take  into  consideration  all  previous  studies  carried  out  by  the \nGovernment, ADB, and other development partners.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000. The Government has requested \nADB  to  finance  $800,000  to  cover  the  costs  of  international  and  national  consultants\u2019 \nremuneration  and  per  diems,  international  and  local  travel,  surveys,  communications, ", "  5\nworkshops, office supplies and equipment, and contingencies. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill contribute $200,000 in kind to cover the cost of office accommodation, transport, and \nremuneration to the counterpart staff. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The details of the cost estimate and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will require about 51 person-months of consulting services (26 international and \n25 national) and is expected to be completed in 9 months. ADB will engage consultants in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nA team of international consultants in association with national consultants will be engaged \nfollowing the quality and cost-based selection method and simplified technical proposals. Seven \ninternational  and  six  national  consultants  will  be  needed  with  expertise  in  (i)  transport, \neconomics, and planning; (ii) road engineering; (iii) geotechnical and materials engineering; (iv) \nroad transport services; (v) labor-intensive construction; (vi) environmental assessment; and (vii) \nsocial and poverty assessment/safeguards. The international team will be supported by national \nconsultants with expertise in the same areas. The outline terms of reference for the consulting \nservices are in Appendix 4.            \n \n17.  MOI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  will  be  responsible  for  guiding  and \nsupervising  the  TA  activities,  as  well  as  for  coordinating  with  other  relevant  Government \nagencies,  district  governments,  and  development  partners.  The  DRBFC,  which  has  direct \nresponsibility for roads, will work closely with the consultants. The TA is expected to commence \nin  October  2008  and  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  by  June  2009.  MOI  will  provide  the \nconsultants all relevant materials, studies, and reports required for the TA. The consultants will \nmaintain close contact with MOI and DRBFC, as well as ADB, and will keep them informed of \nthe TA progress and findings. To develop capacity in environmental and social aspects of road \nprojects, MOI will appoint staff to work closely with the consultants. The consultants will procure \nequipment under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). This equipment will be handed over to the EA upon completion of the TA.             \n \n18.  The consultants will submit the following reports to MOI, DRBFC, and ADB: (i) inception \nreport, 4 weeks following commencement of the services; (ii) phase I interim report, 10 weeks \nafter commencement; (iii) phase I report, 16 weeks after commencement; (iv) phase II interim \nreport,  4  weeks  after  commencing  phase  II;  (v)  draft  final  report,  within  14  weeks  of \ncommencing phase II; and (vi) final report, 2 weeks after receiving comments from MOI and \nADB. The consultants will hold a stakeholder consultation workshop at the completion of phase I, \nand a final workshop on completion of the draft final report to disseminate the TA\u2019s findings. A \ntripartite meeting involving the Government, ADB, and the consultants will be held to review the \ndraft final report and provide guidance in its finalization. \n \nIV.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nTimor-Leste ranks 142 out of 177 countries in the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) Human Development \nIndex (2004) and ranks lowest among ADB\u2019s developing member countries. Poverty levels are high. According to the Timor-\nLeste Living Standard Measurement Survey (2001), 40% of the population lives below the national poverty line of $15.44 per \ncapita income per month. In general, the incidence of poverty is higher in the western than in the eastern region, and it is higher \nin rural than in urban areas. Despite the improvement since 2001, initial data from the forthcoming Timor-Leste Household \nLiving  Standard  Survey  (2007)\u2014while  not  yet  providing  estimates  on  the  incidence  of  poverty\u2014further  confirm  rural \ncommunities\u2019 limited access to drinking water (58.3%), basic sanitation (38.5%), and electricity (19.7%). Rural communities\u2019 \naverage travel time (one way) to health clinics is 55 minutes, to primary schools 33 minutes, to secondary schools 63 minutes, \nto bus terminals or stops 52 minutes, and to police stations 60 minutes. \n \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update for Timor-Leste (2006\u20132008)a identifies transport infrastructure improvement as a \ncore area for ADB assistance. ADB is in the process of finalizing its country partnership strategy (2009\u20132013). Consultations \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  during  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  fact-finding  confirm  that  the \nGovernment of Timor-Leste and ADB are committed to maintaining the focus of their partnership on improving the national \nroads network and extending the support to priority rural roads. Better road infrastructure will provide the rural population \naccess to markets, education, health care, justice, and other essential services. It will also increase food security in rural areas. \n \nThe proposed RNDP\u2019s focus to improve and maintain national roads matches the Government\u2019s priorities set out in the \nNational Development Plan (2002). The road network\u2014from rural to national roads\u2014is impassable at many points. Of key \nimportance is to improve the national road network and then to sequence improvements to district and rural roads so that \nfarmers are able to reach markets and industries to choose locations based on such non-transport factors as availability of local \nlabor and natural resources. The key objective is to ensure connectivity between urban areas and agricultural production \ncenters, ports, and markets. While contributing to the overarching goal of poverty reduction, improving national roads should be \ncomplemented by a long-term strategy to ensure connectivity between national, district, and rural roads, as well as by cost-\neffective modalities to ensure sustainable improvement and maintenance of rural roads. \nB.     Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);   Geographic (TI-G);   Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe proposed project will focus on identified priority areas for improvement and labor-intensive maintenance of national \nroads while working with local communities to support community-based and gender-responsive road construction and \nmaintenance of priority rural roads. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \nnot applicable \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and/or due diligence? \n \nSocial and community development specialists (international and national) will be engaged during PPTA to carry out the \nsocial and/or gender analysis. \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \n \nThe proposed RNDP will contribute to poverty reduction in the project area in the short-term by creating job opportunities for \nunskilled laborers involved in constructing national roads, labor-intensive road maintenance, and community-based road \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nconstruction and maintenance. In the long-term, enhanced national and rural road networks will promote increased access to \nbasic social services (mostly health and education facilities at district and subdistrict level), food security, and marketability of \nlocal products. The proposed adoption of employment targets and/or quotas for women (widows and female heads of \nhouseholds with large number of dependents) and other vulnerable groups (veterans, other disaffected stakeholder groups, \nand the youth) will ensure increased benefits for the poor and socially vulnerable. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nThe project will most likely benefit local communities, passengers, operators of passenger and freight transport vehicles, \nvehicle owners, users of freight transport services, and entrepreneurs with small and large businesses. Rural communities \nwill benefit from the rehabilitated national and rural road networks through enhanced access to basic social services (health \nand education facilities), markets, employment opportunities, and training at district and subdistrict levels. Moreover, in light \nof the nature of the proposed project and its emphasis on promoting labor-intensive and community-based approaches to \ninfrastructure  development,  rural  communities  will  benefit  from  the  employment  opportunities  provided  during  road \nconstruction, labor-intensive maintenance, and community-based road construction and maintenance. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nRural areas in Timor-Leste are mountainous, isolated, and inaccessible. Inadequate road infrastructure is identified as the \ncritical factor perpetuating the poverty and vulnerability of rural communities. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nThe ongoing Road Sector Improvement Project (RSIP) (2005) recognized women\u2019s and other vulnerable groups\u2019 traditional \nexclusion from infrastructure-related employment opportunities and their limited involvement in decision-making processes \nand structures related to road improvement and maintenance. The adoption of targets and/or quotas for women and other \nvulnerable groups will ensure their equal access to the employment opportunities provided under the project and their \neffective participation in any infrastructure development-related decision-making processes and structures. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nDuring PPTA fact-finding, an initial stakeholder analysis was carried out and relevant interest groups identified. There were \nconsultations with the Ministry of Infrastructure (regarding national roads), nongovernment organizations (NGOs), local \ngovernment and community leaders in Bobonaro District, and relevant development partners. Under the terms of reference, \nsocial development specialists will carry out consultations with identified stakeholders, which will include (but not be limited \nto) the Ministry of Infrastructure, RSIP\u2019s project management unit, the Ministry of Employment (on employment and labor \nlaw-related issues), local civil works contractors, and selected NGOs directly and indirectly involved in community-based \ninfrastructure development in the project area (i.e., CARE Timor-Leste, Oxfam-Australia, and Caritas). Further discussions \nwill be carried out with the Ministry of State Administration and Territorial Management to ensure potential synergies with the \nLocal Governance Support Program, administered by UNDP, in selecting project sites and methodology; GTZ (regarding the \nSecond Rural Development Program for Timor-Leste, funded by German development assistance through GTZ); Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (on the Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Arterial Roads Project); the International Labour \nOrganization (Labor-Intensive Project); and the World Food Program (Food for Work Program). These talks will be to assess \nthe scope and geographic coverage of other donors\u2019 interventions, lessons, and emerging practices relevant to the design of \nthe proposed project. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, community \nmobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nIt is anticipated that, during the PPTA, the social development specialists will conduct (i) a stakeholder consultation workshop \nto present the project\u2019s proposed impact and outcome, gain key stakeholders\u2019 understanding and support for the project, and \nreceive suggestions and recommendations on project design; and (ii) field consultations. In selected districts, subdistricts, \nand villages, this will involve (i) key informant interviews to gain local government and community leadership\u2019s understanding, \ninsights, and support; (ii) focus group discussions (separate for men and women participants) to assess with the help of the \nproject  team\u2019s  facilitator  communities\u2019  perceptions  on  poverty  and  potential  road  improvement,  as  well  as  their \ngender-specific needs, issues, and concerns; (iii) a small sample survey (of local households, vehicle operators, passengers, \nfreight shippers, and shops) to obtain various data, including the degree of transport infrastructure usage by various \nshareholder groups and income levels, as well as the structure and performance of the transport services sector. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  Information sharing        Consultation        Collaborative decision making        Empowerment \n \nStakeholder consultations will enable relevant interest groups to express their views on the critical national roads identified \nfor support under the RNDP. Field consultations in selected districts and subdistricts will enable the social and development \nspecialists to seek the views of local communities; share information on the outcome and impact of the proposed project; \ndocument the needs, issues, and concerns raised by local communities regarding rehabilitation of the proposed national \nroads;  and  assess  the  communities\u2019  commitment  and  preparedness  to  be  involved  in  community-based  rural  road \nconstruction and maintenance activities.  \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nA consultation and participation (C&P) plan will be prepared and outline modalities through which stakeholder groups \nidentified during PPTA fact-finding will be engaged in the C&P process; the anticipated breadth and depth of stakeholder \nengagement; how the C&P process will be linked to the summary poverty reduction and social strategy and any safeguards \nrequirements;  and how C&P modalities will be carried through the implementation arrangement of the proposed project. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \n \nThe ongoing RSIP (2005) recognized women\u2019s traditional exclusion from infrastructure-related employment opportunities as \nwell as their limited involvement in decision-making processes and structures related to infrastructure development. The RSIP \naimed to increase women\u2019s access to employment opportunities provided during road rehabilitation and maintenance. Targets \nand quotas for women\u2019s involvement were defined in consultation with the Office for the Promotion of Equality, the Ministry of \nInfrastructure, NGOs, construction companies, and local communities during a stakeholder workshop and field consultations. \nBased on successful implementation of the RSIP (where targets and quotas for women\u2019s participation were fulfilled or \nexceeded), the proposed RNDP will be designed to further advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment by ensuring \nwomen\u2019s access and their involvement in all employment and training opportunities under the project. The PPTA consultants \nwill develop a social action plan. Most specifically, the consultants will assess the feasibility of (i) applying a reasonable quota \nfor women\u2019s involvement in the construction and maintenance of national roads (as opposed to the target approach), directed \ntoward unemployed widows, female heads of households with large numbers of dependents, and other vulnerable groups; (ii) \napplying a 100% quota for women\u2019s involvement in bioengineering (as opposed to 75% in RSIP); and (iii) applying a 60% quota \nfor women\u2019s involvement in community-based road construction and maintenance. \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making? \n  Yes          No    Please explain. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n  Yes          No    Please explain. \nIII.
