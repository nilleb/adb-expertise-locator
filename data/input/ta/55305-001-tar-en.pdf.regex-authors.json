INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested support to strengthen its policy environment \nand human resources capacity to respond to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis. The \nknowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Ministry of Health (MOH) of \nMongolia to improve COVID-19 response and health system resilience through (i) health sector \nassessments for COVID-19 recovery, (ii) documentation of the COVID-19 response and related \nlessons, and (iii) strengthened capacity of government agencies involved in COVID-19 response. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership strategy \nfor  Mongolia,  2021\u22122024;1 Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Program  Health \nStrategy 2030;2 and the ADB Strategy 2030 operational priorities on addressing remaining \npoverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, and fostering regional cooperation and integration.3 The \nTA is included in the country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2021;4 and is also aligned \nwith  Mongolia\u2019s  State Policy  on  Health,  2017\u20132026,  which  reaffirms sustained commitment \ntoward improving health services for the population.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s COVID-19 situation and response. It is estimated that at least 60% of \nMongolia\u2019s population (totaling 1.98 million people) are at high risk of severe disease due to \nCOVID-19. Of these, about 522,428 people are particularly vulnerable (i.e., frontline medical \nworkers, emergency management staff, police and border military, state inspectors, the elderly, \nand individuals with comorbidities). The Government of Mongolia implemented strict measures to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19, with the first case of community transmission reported on 10 \nNovember  2020.6 The  National  Deployment  and Vaccination Plan  against  COVID-19  is  an \nintegral part of Mongolia\u2019s overall national COVID-19 pandemic planning and prioritizes target \ngroups  and  effective  strategies  for  vaccination.  Since  the  start  of  Mongolia\u2019s  COVID-19 \nvaccination program on 23 February 2021, Mongolia has achieved 69.4% COVID-19 vaccination \ncoverage (one or two doses), and its high-risk groups have been immunized.7 \n \n4.  While the COVID-19 vaccination program has been effective, Mongolia is still considered \nhigh risk by the World Health Organization (WHO), which in a 2017 evaluation, concluded that \nMongolia\u2019s core capacities for pandemic preparedness are limited, and that it remains vulnerable \nto emerging diseases and public health emergencies, with challenges in the readiness of the \nnational systems to respond to large-scale, complex events in an effective and coordinated way.8 \n \n1  The TA is related to strategic priority 1: foster inclusive social development and economic opportunity through \nsupporting recovery from COVID-19 by providing training and strengthening emergency procedures. ADB. 2021. \nCountry Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2021\u22122024\u2014Laying Resilient Foundations for Inclusive and Sustainable \nGrowth. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 November 2021.  \n2  ADB. 2021. Enhancing Regional Health Cooperation under CAREC 2030: A Scoping Study. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n4  Originally known as Preparing the Health Security and Health Systems Project, the TA was renamed and changed \nfrom a transaction TA to a knowledge and support TA to reflect the support required due to the ongoing COVID-19 \npandemic based on country needs. ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2021. Manila.  \n5  Government of Mongolia. 2017. The State Policy on Health, 2017\u20132026. Ulaanbaatar. \n6  As of 24 November 2021, there have been a total of 378,833 cases and 1,969 deaths reported in Mongolia. \n7  Mongolia has received 214,400 doses of AstraZeneca and Covishield; 3,500,000 doses of Vero Cell; 296,010 doses \nof Pfizer BioNTech; and 60,000 doses of Sputnik-V. \n8  WHO. 2017. Joint External Evaluation of IHR Core Capacities of Mongolia. Geneva. \n \n ", "2 \nHealth  services  are  overwhelmed  with  hospital  beds;  and  intensive  care  unit  and  human \nresources are stretched beyond capacity. At the same time, Mongolia does not have laboratory \nfacilities and capacity to determine variants, and specimens must be sent to neighboring countries \nfor testing. Significant challenges persist and require continual commitment and support to \nprevent further outbreaks and a rise in cases. \n \n5.  Health  sector  constraints.  Systemic  issues  that  exist  across  the  health  sector  in \nMongolia have led to challenges in COVID-19 pandemic treatment outcomes and management. \nResponsible government agencies lack training on cross-sector pandemic coordination and data \nsharing across ministries such as MOH, the National Emergency Management Agency, and the \nGeneral Agency for Specialized Inspection. The pandemic has also highlighted governance, \nsustainability, and financing constraints in the health sector. Inefficiencies in hospital management \nand poor referral linkages between primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care are also major \nconstraints. Systemic health system issues have limited effective and efficient hospital treatment \noutcomes as the COVID-19 pandemic persists. \n \n6.  Health systems globally have experienced major setbacks and challenges in their ability \nto prepare and respond to the pandemic; this is exacerbated in countries such as Mongolia, where \nhealth sector challenges go beyond the pandemic and highlight a need for a more responsive, \nefficient, and sustainable health system to manage population health. Services such as routine \nimmunization for children and reproductive health services for women have been affected as \nresources have shifted to address the pandemic. Women have been disproportionately affected \nby the pandemic, as 82% of the health workforce is female. The crisis has also increased gender-\nbased violence, as evidenced by the rise in hotline calls and the use of shelters by women. The \nTA assessments with gender focus will help to evaluate health system inefficiencies and propose \npolicy actions to address those with gender-responsive policy measures. \n \n7.  ADB value addition. ADB has been a long-standing development partner for Mongolia, \nand  has  supported  the  health  sector  since  1993.  Through  strategic  partnerships  and  key \ninvestment projects, ADB has supported a range of public health interventions including in primary \nhealth care, drug safety and access, health information technology, human resources for health, \nhealth financing and insurance, and hospital rationalization and strategic planning. ADB has also \nsupported key policy shifts, such as the switch from hospital-based curative services to more \nefficient and cost-effective primary health care; reform of health financing system to support \nuniversal health coverage and increase financial protection of people; rationalization of the \nhospital sector,  provision of increased autonomy for public hospitals to increase efficiency and \nquality of care; and improved patient safety through optimization of health services and regulation \nof medicines. ADB has impacted health sector strategic planning by supporting Mongolia\u2019s Health \nSector Master Plan, 2020\u22122026,9 and provided critical technical advice on key health sector \npolicies and regulations, including for the Law on Medicines and Medical Devices, and the Medical \nCare and Services Law, passed by the Mongolian Parliament. With ADB\u2019s policy support, the \ngovernment has developed important health sector policy documents and amended respective \nlaws and regulations. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB\u2019s support for COVID-19 in Mongolia \nincludes rapid response measures such as (i) reallocation of $1.4 million under an existing health \nsector operation to support the procurement of emergency health equipment; (ii) a $0.225 million \nsmall-scale TA project for emergency response systems; (iii) a $2.5 million in grant support from \n \n9  ADB. Mongolia: Development of the Health Sector Master Plan, 2019\u22122027. During TA implementation, the final \nyear of implementation for the masterplan was changed from 2027 to 2026. \n \n ", "3 \nthe Asia Pacific Disaster Response Facility (including $1.5 million from the Government of Japan); \n(iv) a $30 million loan to support disease control in the health sector; (v) a $26.4 million loan to \nstrengthen social protection measures for vulnerable groups; (vi) a $73 million loan to further \nsupport additional social protection measures for poor and vulnerable groups; (vii) $100 million \nprovided under ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 pandemic to support the \ngovernment to manage the economic and health impacts; (viii) a $100 million policy-based loan \nto support medium- to long-term health sector reforms; (ix) $5 million in grant support to procure \nlab equipment and personal protective equipment; and (x) a $40 million Asia Pacific Vaccine \nAccess Facility project to procure COVID-19 vaccines. 10 The TA will complement these response \nmeasures and strengthen the health system and determine and assess post COVID-19 recovery \nneeds.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: a more responsive, efficient, and sustainable \nhealth system achieved (footnote 5). The TA will have the following outcome: policies on COVID-\n19 response and public health preparedness strengthened. The TA will strengthen institutional \ncapacity and conduct assessments on public hospital management, procurement and safety of \nmedicines, pharmaceutical and vaccine regulation, public\u2212private partnerships in health, and \nstrategic health purchasing to move toward universal health coverage. Building resilient health \nsystems for post-COVID-19 recovery will require a renewed focus on health policies that directly \nimpact the efficiency and sustainability of delivering cost-effective health care to populations in \nneed.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Resilient health systems for COVID-19 recovery assessed. This output will \nconduct a sector analysis of the ongoing health system challenges and will seek solutions to \naddressing Mongolia\u2019s overall and broader medium- to long-term health system challenges. A \nseries of assessments on foundational health system areas will be conducted and may include (i) \npharmaceutical and vaccine regulation and quality, (ii) medicine procurement and affordability in \npublic hospitals, (iii) public hospital management, (iv) health financing mechanisms to increase \naccess to quality health services, (v) public\u2212private partnerships in the health sector, (vi) public \nhealth  and  health  education,  and  (vii)  reproductive  health services  for  women  and  routine \nimmunization  for  children.  Additional  assessments  may  also  be  conducted  on  managing \navailability of necessary medical equipment in public hospitals during emergencies. Gender \nanalyses will be conducted in the assessments. Policy recommendations and an assessment of \npriority areas for investment and opportunity in the health sector will be prepared and submitted \nto MOH. The assessments will be conducted in close consultation with specialized organizations \n(e.g., WHO). \n \n \n10 ADB. Mongolia: Fifth Health Sector Development Project; ADB.

Output 2: COVID-19 response and lessons documented. This output will take stock of \nthe health sector\u2019s COVID-19 response and produce a real-time evaluation of the successes and \nchallenges in national pandemic management in order to urgently understand how to adjust and \npivot policy decisions as the health emergency persists.12 The evaluation will also highlight \ngender issues. The evaluation will also be disseminated in the form of a knowledge product in \nEnglish and Mongolian. A series of country consultations with development partners\u2014such as \nthe  World  Bank,  WHO,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  civil  society \norganizations\u2014will be organized. \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge and skills of government agencies involved in COVID-19 \nresponse strengthened. Under this output, training on topics identified through the real-time \nevaluation  of  the  COVID-19  response  will  be  organized.  Topics  may  include  the  incident \nmanagement system, intersectoral information exchanges, intra-agency pandemic coordination, \ninteragency  MOH  management,  and  addressing  vaccine  hesitancy  through  community \nmobilization efforts and effective health communication. Female representation will be ensured \nduring the training, while gender sensitivities, especially for training areas such as vaccine \nhesitancy, will be incorporated in training modules. This output will also provide capacity building \nsupport to the National Emergency Management Agency, the General Agency for Specialized \nInspection, and other agencies on pandemic management. Training for health specialists in public \nhospitals will also be provided. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $680,000, of which $650,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7).
