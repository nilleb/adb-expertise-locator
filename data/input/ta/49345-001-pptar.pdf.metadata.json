The  sector  development  framework  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  envisions \nsustainable development of energy resources, enabling access to and use of low cost energy \nservices by the entire population, and reliable delivery of such services at a competitive price.1 \nTo increase access to electricity and achieve the goal of meeting the growing demand for \nelectricity  at  sufficiently  low  cost  and  acceptable  reliability  to  widen  access  to  growth \nopportunities and attain sustainability and energy security in the long term, the government \nplans to increase supply capacity of the system by raising the share of renewable energy \nsources, particularly wind power generation in Sri Lanka\u2019s energy mix. To address investment \nneeds in support of these plans, a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is needed to \nprepare a relevant investment project for consideration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nMajor Outputs and Activities \n2.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A3.1.  \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \nConducting project technical,  June 2017  Inception Report  August 2016 \neconomic, financial,  Interim Report  December 2016 \ngovernance, resettlement and  Final Report  June 2017 \nenvironmental, and other due \ndiligence  \n       \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The TA will support the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the implementing agency, in \npreparing a feasibility study, preliminary engineering design, and conducting due diligence. As \npart of advance contracting, PPTA consultants will assist in preparing procurement packages \nand relevant bidding documents for the proposed CEB wind power generation, and competitive \nbidding documents for private sector participation in the project. The PPTA consultants will also \nprepare a road map and options for private sector involvement in further developing renewable \nenergy sources in the country. \n \nCost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n4.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Clean \nEnergy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  (CEFPF)  which  is \nadministered by ADB. 2 The Government of Sri Lanka will provide counterpart support in the \nform of office accommodation and support facilities, counterpart staff, technical data, and other \nin-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimate is presented in Table A3.2. \n   \n                                                           \n1  Government of Sri Lanka, 2008.
