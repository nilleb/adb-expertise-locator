On 6 March 2013, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for \nthe Public Finance Development Strategy 2020. Dialogue with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nclarified the policy and institutional context, and the priorities for ADB support. Agreement was \nreached  with  the  government  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  output,  implementation \narrangements,  cost  and  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The cost estimates are in Appendix 2 and the terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  More  than three  decades  of  successful  reform  have  transformed the  PRC  into the \nworld\u2019s second largest economy. Rapid growth allowed for a swift transition from a low-income \ncountry to a middle-income country. Today, the challenge lies in moving up to high-income \nstatus and balancing income distribution. In this context, the leadership that took office in March \n2013  has  indicated  their  intention  to  focus  on  the  quality,  efficiency,  and  sustainability  of \neconomic growth. The reform priorities to achieve the goal have been identified, and further \npublic finance and fiscal reform feature prominently in the new leadership\u2019s reform agenda.  \n  \n3.  Recent economic trends in the PRC suggest that the high growth rates are stabilizing at \nmore moderate levels. This is consistent with government targets for lower growth in the context \nof  economic  restructuring  to  rebalance  the  economy.  Against  this  background,  a  different \nmacroeconomic environment will require fiscal policy adjustments including a change in the \noptimal medium-term public revenue share of gross domestic product (GDP), improved tax \nadministration, and higher and better targeted social expenditure to increase living standards \nand balance income distribution. \n \n4.  Important public finance system reforms have been implemented in the PRC since 1982 \non  taxation,  budget  management,  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  arrangements.  However, \nsystemic  weaknesses  are  reflected  in  large  income  inequality  and  regional  disparities, \nsuboptimal  provision  of  basic  social  services,  and  insufficient  fiscal  revenue  to  address \nchallenging development needs. This has resulted in a wide income gap and low consumption \nlevels constraining the enormous potential of the domestic engines of growth in the PRC.  \n  \n5.  As economic reforms progressed, state redistributive mechanisms weakened. In the \n1990s,  provision  of  public  services  was  decentralized  to  local  governments,  without  a \ncorresponding increase in fiscal transfers. Social spending has increased rapidly since 2008, \nbut remains insufficient to ensure optimal delivery of public goods. About 30% of government \nrevenue is spent on social security, education, and healthcare, compared with an average of \n52% in other middle-income countries. Moreover, recent reforms have focused on expanding \nthe coverage of benefits rather than restructuring the benefits themselves. Universal coverage \nand equal access to social benefits in urban and rural areas requires increased budget support \nand reform of income distribution and equalizing mechanisms. \n \n6.  In the transition to a market-oriented economy, only limited taxation has been introduced. \nTax revenues in the PRC increased steadily following fiscal reform in 1994 but levels remain low \nat 20% of GDP, compared with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 April 2013. \n ", "2   \naverage of 34%. Recent income taxation reforms have reduced the number of personal income \ntaxpayers  to  less  than 3%  of the  population, and  yields  amount  to  less  than  6%  of total \nrevenue\u2014far below the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development average of \n24%. The narrow income tax base deprives policy makers of a powerful income distribution tool.  \n \n7.  Further, revenues are too heavily sourced from indirect taxes (64% of total tax revenue), \nwhich double desirable levels. Indirect taxes are easy to collect but are regressive, undermining \nefforts to balance income distribution. Greater emphasis on direct taxation would shift the tax \nburden from low-income to high-income households, resulting in a fairer distribution of income. \nFrom the production point of view, taxes are biased in favor of manufacturing to the detriment of \nthe service sector, which is often subject to double taxation under the existing business tax. This \nhampers the development of a sector that is a crucial source of future growth and employment \ngeneration. \n \n8.  Most importantly, a serious mismatch exists between expenditures and revenues at the \nlocal government level\u2014resulting from the high degree of expenditure decentralization. The \ncentral  government  accounts  for  about  30%  of  total  public  expenditure,  whereas  local \ngovernments assume the remaining 70% with limited resources, as they transfer to the central \ngovernment the largest share of local collections. For instance, 75% of the value-added tax \n(VAT)  revenue,  the  single  largest  source  of  tax  revenue,  is  transferred  to  the  central \ngovernment. Attempts by local governments to address the gap have resulted in an over-\nreliance  on  land  sales  and  off-budget  borrowing  through  financing  vehicles,  the  latter \nthreatening the stability of the financial sector. \n \n9.  The government has adopted a range of measures to address these challenges. So far, \nthey have had limited impact with the low revenue collection, inadequate social expenditure, \nand  a  regressive  bias  in  the  taxation  system.  Recent  pilot  tested  initiatives\u2014such  as  the \nintroduction  of  a  property  tax  on  luxury  housing  in  Shanghai  and  Chongqing,  and  the \nreplacement of the business tax by the VAT on selected services in 12 cities\u2014are important \nsteps in the right direction that need to be developed. \n \n10.  The  scale  of  the  challenges  calls  for  greater  efforts  to  overhaul  public  finance \nmanagement in the PRC. In-depth fiscal and taxation reforms can play a leading role promoting \na shift toward a more inclusive economic model, as evidenced by successful experiences in \nother countries. In developed economies, large fiscal transfers and reforms to broaden the base \nand increase the progressivity of taxation have proven effective in distributing income. Looking \nforward, reforms should pursue measures to increase the progressivity of taxation to balance \nincome  distribution  while  reforming  taxation  to  ensure  optimal  revenue  levels  to  finance \ndevelopment challenges. In this context, revenue allocation to the local level needs to be \naligned  with  expenditure  responsibilities  after  clearly  defining  the  role  of  the  state  in  the \nprovision of public finance at all government levels. Otherwise, large disparities in public social \nspending per person will perpetuate inequality.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be a strengthened fiscal policy and taxation system in the PRC. The \noutcome will be an improved fiscal and taxation framework in the PRC.  \n \n ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The output will be a report containing a strategy to guide public finance reform until 2020 \nto promote inclusive growth and more balanced income distribution in the PRC. The report will \ncomprise three sub-reports analyzing the priorities of fiscal and taxation reform from different \nangles: (i) the role of the government and public finance and their expected functions to address \nmarket failures, (ii) taxation and tax administration reform to balance income distribution and \neliminate tax distortions, and (iii) optimal revenue levels to address development needs amid \ndeclining growth to ensure an equitable provision of public services.  \n  \n13.  Sub-report 1 will focus on the role and function of public finance to (i) define the role of \nthe government and public finance and their expected functions to address market failures, \n(ii) establish guidelines for well-functioning intergovernmental working arrangements at all levels \nof government, and (iii) optimize public expenditure to ensure efficient and equitable delivery of \npublic services.  \n \n14.  Sub-report 2 will look into policy actions to reform taxation and tax administration through \n(i) greater taxation progressivity in relation to good international practices to balance income \ndistribution, (ii) measures to broaden and simplify the tax structure and adjust tax rates to \neliminate distortions in the system, and (iii) reforms to address the mismatch in revenue and \nexpenditure through increased fiscal transfers and improved tax administration at all levels of \ngovernment. \n \n15.  Sub-report 3 will (i) review and identify weaknesses in revenue collection and sharing to \nreform expenditure assignments; (ii) analyze the fiscal policy implications of slowing economic \ngrowth to estimate optimal levels of revenue for the sustainable provision of public expenditure, \nin particular on education, health, and social security; and (iii) analyze innovative approaches for \nthe effective delivery of public services, including the promotion of various forms of partnerships \nwith the private sector. \n \n16.  The three sub-reports will draw on an international study tour. The study tour will focus \non countries with a high standard of success in the focus area. The study tour will be conducted \nbefore the preparation of the draft final reform, and the relating output will be incorporated in the \ndraft final report. The implementing agency will prepare a short report outlining the contents and \nfindings of the study tour. \n \n17.  In addition to the three sub-reports, the final report will include a synopsis containing \ndetailed policy recommendations to guide the implementation of the identified reform priorities \ntargeting senior policy decision makers in the PRC. \n \n18.  The TA will disseminate research findings and policy recommendations through three \nnational workshops (inception, midterm review, and final review), and a final dissemination \nevent to present key findings and policy suggestions to a wider audience. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide in-kind contribution in the form of office space, accommodation, transport, remuneration, \nand per diem of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contribution. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 22 months, from 1 August 2013 to 30 June 2015. The \nInternational  Department  of  the  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  The \nComprehensive Department of the MOF will be the implementing agency. The International \nDepartment  of  the  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  and  chairing  a  TA  steering \ncommittee  composed  of  representatives  of  relevant  ministries  and  agencies.  The  steering \ncommittee will be regularly consulted and invited to participate in TA activities.  \n \n21.  In dialogue with the executing agency, ADB will recruit national and international public \nfinance experts to provide inputs as individual consultants. A total of 25 person-months of \nindividual consulting services (six national consultants for a total of 23 person-months and one \ninternational  consultant  for  2  person-months)  will  be  selected  based  on  their  academic \nqualifications and relevant work experience. Given the required expertise, the national and \ninternational  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  by  ADB  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The consultant team will be responsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables in \na  timely  and  effective  manner,  and  for  organizing  and  carrying  out  all  TA  activities.  The \nconsultants will report to the assigned ADB project office, and all outputs and reports will be \nprepared in English. Terms of reference and the required expertise of the consultants are in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n22.  The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment procured under the \nTA will be transferred to the executing agency upon TA completion. \n \n23.  TA support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, food and beverages, transportation, lodging, logistics and \nadministrative support, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with \nstandard ADB procedures, the TA will not support the implementing agency\u2019s management fees \nor related costs such as staff salaries and allowances, and the use of implementing agency \nresources (such as office accommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart \ncontribution.  \n \n24.  The executing agency will provide a suitably furnished office with computers, utilities, \nand telecommunications access (including broadband internet connection), materials, maps, \ndata, and documents as required under the TA; and will cover the cost of office utilities for the \nconsultants. The executing agency will designate a TA focal point with strong English speaking \nand writing skills, and will facilitate all TA activities and links to local government and providers \nto ensure the effective implementation of TA activities.  \n \nIV.
