It supports the RPJM\u2019s broad goal of stimulating \nhigher and sustainable economic growth (to 7% average annual growth \nby 2009 up from levels around 4% prior to 2004) and halving poverty (to \n8.2% by 2009 from 16.6% in 2004). To achieve these goals, the DPSP \nis a policy engagement tool that accelerates economy-wide and cross \ncutting reforms.  More specifically, it has involved the implementation of \na set of policy actions in four core areas to (i) improve macroeconomic \nstability and creditworthiness; (ii) promote investments; (iii) strengthen \nthe financial sector; and (iv) enhance the quality of public financial \nmanagement and reduce corruption. Supported by a $200 million single \ntranche  operation,  the  DPSP\u2019s  key  achievements  are  the  upfront \nimplementation of the core policy actions, and the development and \nbuilding of full Government commitment for a forward-looking program \nthat deepens the reforms in the core areas, while striving to strengthen \npublic service delivery to the poor.  \n   \nRationale  Exiting the International Monetary Fund-supported program, to ensure \npolicy continuity and to deepen the post-crisis reforms, in a period of \npolitical transition leading up to the Presidential elections, in September \n2003 the Government announced a structural reform package - the \nWhite  Paper.  Recognizing  the  centrality  of  this  Paper,  the  principal \ndevelopment partners, including ADB, supported its formulation as well \nas implementation. ADB specifically focused on deepening reforms in \nfinance  and  governance,  building  on  post-crisis  sector  restructuring \noutcomes.  Substantial  ADB  technical  assistance  and  economic  and \nsector  work  supported  White  Paper  implementation.  In  parallel,  the \nWorld Bank supported White Paper implementation over the period \n2003\u20132004 with a Development Policy Loan (DPL) (cofinanced by the \nGovernment of Japan).  The DPL framework has its origin in the World \nBank\u2019s Country Assistance Strategy, which advocates support for the \nGovernment\u2019s macroeconomic and crosscutting reforms through three \nsequentially designed DPLs.  \n \nBuilding on the White Paper and developing its own priorities, the new \nGovernment, which assumed office in October 2004, announced the \nRPJM  for  2004\u20132009  in  November  2005.  The  RPJM  has  three \nobjectives: peace and security, justice and democracy, and prosperity ", "ii \nfor all. The Government has further instituted a system of annual work \nplans (RKP), approved each year by the Cabinet to help implement \nRPJM. \n \nTo provide effective impetus to the RPJM, the Government requested \nthe  principal  development  partners,  at  the  Consultative  Group  on \nIndonesia  meeting  in  January  2005,  to  enhance  and  intensify  their \nmacroeconomic and sector policy engagement structured around the \nRPJM.  In  response,  a  common  policy  agenda  was  developed  and \nagreed upon during formulation of the DPSP. The DPSP serves as a \ntool to anchor and track progress in four principal areas: promoting \nmacroeconomic  stability,  improving  the  investment  climate, \nstrengthening the financial sector, and strengthening public financial \nmanagement and anticorruption. As an integral part of the DPSP, the \nGovernment has shown strong commitment for forward-looking reforms \nto guide RPJM implementation during 2006\u20132009. \n \nThe DPSP aims to harmonize policy reform support of key development \npartners by providing parallel financing with the World Bank and the \nGovernment of Japan, which are processing a second phase of the \nDevelopment Policy Loan (DPL-2). The DPSP effectively builds on and \ndeepens sector-specific reforms supported by ADB through past and \nongoing operations. \n \nThe DPSP adheres to ADB\u2019s recent efforts to reduce transaction costs \nfor its developing member countries. The approach is also consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  as  outlined  in  the  Long-Term  Strategic \nFramework, Medium-Term Strategy, and the Middle-Income Country \nInitiative. The DPSP helps implement and fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the \nRome  Declaration  on  harmonizing  procedures  of  multilateral \ndevelopment banks (February 2003) and the recent Paris Declaration \non Aid Effectiveness (March 2005).   \n   \nImpact and  The DPSP aims to (i) achieve and sustain higher economic growth \nOutcome  through  improved  fiscal  management  and  investment  climate,  and \nenhancing  financial  sector  soundness;  and  (ii)  reduce  poverty  and \nunemployment by reorienting public expenditures to productive needs, \nand by strengthening governance in public financial management. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Government\u2019s external financing needs for the 2005 budget are \nestimated at $3.6 billion, comprising $1.25 billion in program loans \u2013 to \nsupport the reforms \u2013 and $2.35 billion in project disbursements. In \naddition to the DPSP support of $200 million, the Government has \nrequested $400 million from the World Bank through DPL-2 and parallel \nfinancing support (amount to be determined) from the Government of \nJapan. \n   \n ", "iii \nLoan Amount and  A  single-tranche  program  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \nTerms  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options that may be exercised \nin accordance with the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and \nADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement. \n   \nDisbursement  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of loan \neffectiveness. \n   \nProgram Period and  The DPSP period is from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2006. All actions \nTranching  included in the Policy Matrix have been implemented during the course \nof 2005. The DPSP fits within the overall reform agenda supported \nunder the DPLs, which covers 2003\u20132007. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans, the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting \nimport documentation will be required, if, during each year when loan \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Indonesia\u2019s total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The key benefits expected from the DPSP are \nand Beneficiaries   \n(i)  progress  toward  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of \nmacroeconomic stability and creditworthiness; improved investment \nclimate, reduced corruption, and improved governance; \n \n(ii) consolidation of recent macroeconomic and policy reforms leading \nto  the  formulation  of  a  credible  medium-term  public  expenditure \nframework, backed by measures to curtail wasteful public spending; \n \n(iii) institutional  development  within  Government  institutions,  Bank \nIndonesia, and banks; \n \n \n ", "iv \n(iv) greater public confidence in the banking system stemming from the \nintroduction of the deposit protection scheme; \n \n(v) sustained ADB engagement in policy dialogue with the Government \non the direction and content of, and strategies for, its economic, \nstructural, and institutional reform agenda - with the DPSP providing \nfor  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in  sectors  where  ADB  has \nbeen actively involved; \n \n(vi) facilitation, through cross-cutting reforms, of sector-specific reforms \nin areas where ADB is providing or planning support; and  \n \n(vii) harmonization  and  parallel  financing  by  the  key  development \npartners (ADB, World Bank, and Government of Japan) around a \ncommon  policy  framework  and  dialogue,  and  the  resulting \nendorsement of the Government\u2019s sound policy implementation and \nmacroeconomic management. \n   \nRisks and Mitigating  The DPSP is subject to the following risks: \nMeasures   \n(i)  Economic  volatility  may  increase  if  the  Government  does  not \nsustain the reform momentum to follow up on the recent reduction in \nfuel subsidies (including maintaining appropriate interest rates and \ninvestment climate reforms). This risk is mitigated by the clear policy \nstance  taken  thus  far  by  the  Government  and  Bank  Indonesia. \nFollowing the recent currency market volatility, the need for rapid \npolicy  adjustment  on  the  domestic  front  in  line  with  key  global \ndevelopments is now clearly recognized. \n \n(ii) Rising interest rates may trigger financial stress in debt markets with \ncontagion effects on banks and mutual funds. In turn, this may \naffect growth prospects.  \n \n(iii) Increased social tensions could result from the reduction of fuel \nsubsidies announced on 1 October 2005. Thus far no major protests \nhave been experienced; the success of the ongoing unconditional \ncash transfers program is vital in containing public disenchantment. \nThis  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  Government\u2019s  focus  on  ongoing \nevaluation of this program, with ADB support. The Government also \naims to formulate a broad-based public expenditure reorientation \nprogram; an area where ADB is actively involved. \n \n(iv) The external environment may deteriorate, if high oil-prices continue \nresulting in a slowdown in world economic growth and trade, and \nunfavorable  conditions  in  world  financial  markets.  The \nGovernment\u2019s October 2005 policy package provides for attracting \ninvestments  in  the  oil  and  gas  sector,  which  in  turn  will  help \nIndonesia effectively manage its natural resources and reap the \nbenefits of any windfall gains.  \n \n(v)  Heightened security alerts stemming from sectarian and regional \nconflicts, and terrorism could slow foreign direct investment and set \nback the recovering tourism industry. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Development Policy Support Program (DPSP). The DPSP \nsupports  the  common  development  policy  agenda  as  prepared  by  a  joint  team  of  the \nGovernment of Indonesia (the Government), Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, and \nGovernment of Japan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \nA.  Development Strategies and Plan \n \n2.  In  September  2003,  the  Government  prepared  a  White  Paper,  setting  forth  broad-\nranging  macroeconomic  and  sector  reforms,  to  provide  policy  continuity  and  bridge  any \ncredibility gap to emerge after Indonesia\u2019s exit from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-\nsupported program, as well as during the political transition leading to elections in 2004. The \nnew  Government,  which  assumed  office  in  October  2004,  announced  the  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (RPJM) for 2004\u20132009 in November 2005. The RPJM has three objectives: \npeace and security, justice and democracy, and prosperity for all. The Government\u2019s annual \nwork plan (RKP), approved each year by the Cabinet, guides RPJM implementation. The RKP \nfor  2006  has  seven  priority  areas  to:  reduce  poverty  and  disparity,  increase  employment, \nrevitalize  agriculture,  improve  access  to  and  quality  of  education,  reduce  corruption, \nstrengthening defense capacities, and rehabilitate and reconstruct Aceh and Nias (Figure 1).  \n \n \n  Figure 1: Links between Indonesia\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan, \n  Annual Work Plan, and the Development Policy Support Program \n \n  RPJM\n   Medium-Term Development Plan \nN\n     Objective 1  (3 objectives aOdbdjreecstsivineg 2 33 policy areas)  Objective 3 ation\na\n   A Safe and Peaceful  A Just and Democratic  A Prosperous  l S\n   Indonesia  Indonesia  Indonesia  tra\n  te\n    (in dgy foSN\n        (7 pArinonriutya lRa WrKeoParsk  iPn l2a0n0 6)  raft)r Poverty RPK \n    e\n   Priority 1  Priority 2  Priority 3 Priority 4 duc\n   Reduction of  Employment  Revitalizing  Improving access  tio\nn\n   poverty and  opportunities,  agriculture  and quality of   \n  disparity  investments,  and rural  education and \n \nexports  development  health services \n \n \n \n \n   Priority 5  Priority 6 Priority 7\n  Eradication of  Strengthening  Rehabilitating and \n \n  corruption,  defense capacity,  reconstructing \n \nbureaucracy reform,  security and order,  Aceh and Nias \n \n   law enforcement  conflictresolution\n  \n   Dotted boxes signify areas supported by the Development Policy Support Program. \n  \nNote: Dotted boxes signify areas supported by the Development Policy Support Program. \nSource: National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas). ", "2   \n3.  In  its  first  year,  the  new  Government  continued  the  fiscal  consolidation  process; \nlaunched  substantive  legal  and  regulatory  reforms  for  strengthening  decentralization, \ninvestment, and the infrastructure sectors; and reinvigorated the campaign against corruption, \nincluding pursuit of several high-profile cases. Efforts to address constraints in decentralization \nand the public expenditure program are aimed to reduce poverty and accelerate attainment of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Notably, the Government has maintained a strong \nfocus  on  its  medium-term  development  priorities,  despite  the  massive  devastation  and \ndisruption caused by the December 2004 earthquake and tsunami. \n \n4.  To provide effective impetus to the RPJM, the Government requested the principal \ndevelopment partners, at the Consultative Group on Indonesia meeting in January 2005, to \nenhance and intensify their macroeconomic and sector policy engagement structured around \nthe RPJM. In response, a common policy agenda was developed and agreed upon during the \nformulation of the DPSP. The DPSP serves as a tool to anchor and track progress in three \nprincipal  areas:  promoting  macroeconomic  stability,  improving  the  investment  climate,  and \nstrengthening public financial management and anticorruption.  \n \nB.  The DPSP \u2013 the Government and Development Partnership \n \n5.  Given  the  close  alignment  between  its  own  reform  agenda  and  the  DPSP,  the \nGovernment has shown its absolute ownership and commitment and engaged in policy dialogue \nin a seamless manner throughout DPSP formulation and implementation. The Government\u2019s \nownership of the DPSP policy agenda is underscored by its development policy letter addressed \njointly to the Presidents of ADB and the World Bank (Appendix 2). \n \n6.  The DPSP and the Development Policy Loans. The World Bank\u2019s Country Assistance \nStrategy (CAS) lays out the rationale and justification for a series of Development Policy Loans \n(DPL), subject to progress in (i) improving macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness; (ii) \nimproving the investment climate; (iii) accelerating governance and anticorruption reforms; and \n(iv)  improving  service  delivery  to  the  poor.  Sequentially,  the  process,  led  fully  by  the \nGovernment, has three phases:  \n \n(i)  DPL-1, financed by the World Bank ($300 million approved in December 2004) \nwith parallel financing from the Government of Japan ($100 million approved in \nearly 2005), supported the Government\u2019s White Paper reforms and President \nYudhoyono\u2019s \u201c100-Day Plan\u201d. In parallel, ADB supported the formulation and \nimplementation of the White Paper through reforms in finance and governance, \nbuilding on post-crisis sector restructuring outcomes.1   \n \n(ii)  DPL-2/DPSP, a product of joint missions and financing of the World Bank ($400 \nmillion),  ADB  ($200  million),  and  the  Government  of  Japan  (support  being \ndetermined), was activated upon satisfactory compliance with the DPL-2 and \nCAS  triggers  (Appendixes  2  and  3).  The  DPL-2  focuses  on  the  first  three \nprincipal focus areas of the CAS: macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, \n                                                 \n1  Key initiatives implemented during 2003\u20132004 include (i) Financial Governance and Social Security Reform \nProgram, State-Owned Governance and Privatization Program, and Industrial Competitiveness and Small and \nMedium Enterprise Development Program; and (ii) policy dialogue to strengthen national and local government \npublic  financial  management,  leading  to  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment Program (SDP) and State Audit Reform SDP. These programs built on the crisis-recovery support \ninitiatives that included Financial Governance Reform SDP, the Community and Local Government Support SDP, \nand the Social Protection SDP. \n ", "   3\ninvestment climate, and public financial management. This operation is anchored \non the RPJM, RKP, and emerging policy statements of the Government, which \nhave built on the reform achievements of White Paper. The DPL-2 formulation \nhas benefited from the analytical support of the development partners, and is \nbuilt on recent and ongoing ADB operations (footnote 1). At a technical level, the \nDPSP draws on the analyses in ADB\u2019s Governance Assessment, draft Country \nPoverty  Analysis,  draft  Private  Sector  Assessment,  and  technical  assistance \nprojects on anticorruption.2 \n \n(iii)  DPL-3 (the forward-looking phase of DPSP) is to be activated by a host of new \ntriggers (Section III) to sustain the DPL-2 agenda through continuous policy \nengagement and deepen reforms within the three pillars of DPL-2, while adding a \nmajor component to help improve public service delivery.  \n \n7.  The DPSP and ADB\u2019s Strategy. The DPSP is a key pillar of ADB\u2019s emerging country \nstrategy and program for 2006\u20132010. Under this, a dual-track approach is proposed to ensure \ncontinuity and sustainability of past ADB-supported initiatives. This would involve structuring \nADB support through (i) participation in the DPLs to strengthen the macroeconomic and fiscal \nframework and address cross-cutting concerns; and (ii) sector-specific policy interventions. For \nexample, in 2005, ADB launched upfront partnerships with the World Bank and the Government \nof Japan to develop a conceptual framework and design for infrastructure sector reform. All key \ndevelopment partners have a policy engagement in areas covered in the ADB-supported Local \nGovernment Finance and Governance Reform Sector Development Program,3 which provides \nan overall umbrella for decentralization policy reforms. Joint technical work is underway by both \nthe ADB and the World Bank on poverty reduction and acceleration of MDGs.  \n \n8.  The proposed ADB parallel financing support for the DPL (through the DPSP) and ADB-\nsupported and coordinated sector-specific interventions are among the key holistic attempts to \nalign  and  harmonize  development  partner  strategies  with  Indonesia\u2019s  country  strategy  and \npriorities. ADB\u2019s participation in the DPL process and the parallel policy dialogue on sector \nreforms has been appreciated by Government. Over the medium-term, the dual-track approach \nwill  help  reinforce  reforms  under  both  streams  and  facilitate  close  coordination  among \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n9.  Linkage of DPSP, DPLs and RPJM. The DPSP, building on DPL-1, is anchored on \nDPL-2 and DPL-3 with enhancement to capture ADB\u2019s continued policy engagement in the \nfinancial sector. The policy dialogue and fact-finding missions for the DPSP were an ongoing \nprocess that culminated in a policy matrix, which was firmed up during the joint Appraisal \nMission in November 2005.4 The DPSP covers policy actions implemented during 2005, with the \nanticipation of continuous engagement over 2006\u20132007 to support the next phase.

Harmonization  and  Complementarity.  The  policy  components  and  actions  of  the \nDPSP are sequenced and paced to accommodate the prevailing political economy of Indonesia, \nwhere the legislature must fully buy into the agenda, where it takes time to ensure stakeholder \nownership and effective implementation. Harmonization of strategies of development partners \naround the Government\u2019s own program has bolstered further country ownership of the reforms \nand has helped forge a new relationship between the Government and its principal development \npartners. Further, harmonization around the reform programs, such as the DPLs and ADB-\nsupported sector reform initiatives, builds on the natural synergy and complementarities that \nexist among the development partners. Combining the strengths and expertise of each of the \ndevelopment partners has helped ensure quality and consistency of advice and reduce the \ntransaction cost of policy dialogue. \n \nC.   Recent Economic Performance \n \n11.  Indonesia\u2019s track record of economic management in recent years has been consistent \nand positive. During 2001\u20132004, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew steadily and fiscal \nconsolidation was impressive, with the budget deficit declining from minus 3.2% of GDP to \nminus 1.1%, a reduction of about 2.1%. Effective monetary management stabilized inflation, \ninterest rates, and the exchange rate (around Rp9,500); and foreign exchange reserves rose to \nabout  $35  billion.  The  real  GDP  in  the  first  half  of  2005  grew  by  5.9%  driven  by  strong \ninvestment growth,5 reversing the earlier consumption-led growth pattern, as reflected in the rise \nin import of capital goods and accelerating growth in the nontradable sectors. Despite strong \nexport growth, the rise in imports due to adverse developments in the oil and gas sector led to a \nrise in the external current account deficit. The combination of these events resulted in a \ncumulative drawdown of foreign exchange reserves by nearly $6 billion in the past few months, \nto $32 billion in September 2005.  \n \n12.  A few disturbing trends underlie this favorable economic picture. Until recently, growth \nhas been primarily consumption led, with investment levels declining. Fiscal compression at the \nnational  level,  coupled  with  the  challenges  of  decentralization,  precipitated  by  weak \nintergovernment fiscal relations and lack of effective onlending arrangements for assistance to \nlocal governments, have affected the quantity and quality of public service delivery. \n  \n13.  Economic outcomes in 2005 have been further impacted by the (i) preoccupation in the \nfirst quarter of 2005 with rescue, recovery, and rehabilitation efforts in Aceh,6 which delayed \neconomywide reforms; and (ii) sharp rise in international oil prices and higher than projected \nfuel imports.7 The latter increased the fuel oil subsidy bill from Rp34 trillion (based on $24 per \nbarrel oil price) to around Rp110 trillion (based on $54 per barrel). Uncertainty about the \ntimetable for the gradual removal of fuel subsidies created short-term economic volatility in \nfinancial markets. Global interest rate pressures and slow adjustments of domestic interest rates \ngenerated instability in exchange markets causing the rupiah to depreciate to Rp11,400 to the \ndollar  in  early  September  2005.  Subsequent  adjustments  in  interest  rates  and  the  sharp \nreduction in fuel subsidies have helped stabilize the exchange rate, though inflation spiraled in \nOctober (para.36).8  \n \n14.  Against this background, Indonesia has managed to achieve some progress in reducing \npoverty. Recent household survey data indicate that poverty incidence has fallen from the peak \nat 23.4% (or 48 million people) in 1999, back to the pre-crisis levels of 16.7% (or 36 million \n                                                 \n5  Investment levels have now grown by more than 10% for six straight quarters since March 2004, the longest period \nof sustained growth since the late 1980s. \n6  On a positive note, the disaster provided impetus to signing of a peace pact with the Free Aceh Movement. \n7  This was due to declining domestic production coupled with rising domestic consumption. \n8  Such measures may have an adverse impact on economic growth in the near term, before the full benefits of any \npublic expenditure reorientation programs (using fuel subsidy savings) are felt. \n ", "6   \npeople) by 2004. However, considerable geographic variations remain.9 The poverty trends and \ntheir regional distribution indicate that Indonesia faces major challenges in designing its public \nexpenditure programs and in ensuring that the benefits of growth reach the poor, in both rural \nand urban areas (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Proportion and Number of Poor  \n \nYear  Proportion of Poor People (%)   Number of Poor People (million) \nUrban  Rural  Total  Urban  Rural  Total \n1999  19.4  26.0  23.4  15.6  32.3  47.9 \n2002  14.5  21.1  18.2  13.3  25.1  38.4 \n2003  13.6  20.2  17.4  12.2  25.1  37.3 \n2004  12.1  20.0  16.7  11.4  24.7  36.1 \na  A new poverty measurement methodology was applied beginning in 1996. Data for all subsequent years are based \non this new method, and cannot be compared with pre-1996 estimates.  \nSource: Maksum, Choiril. 2004. Official Poverty Measurement in Indonesia. Indonesia: Central Bureau of Statistics. \n \nD.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n15.  While the Government has embarked on a program of bold reforms, the reforms are far \nfrom  being  complete.  The  unfinished  reform  agenda  has  provided  the  opportunity  for  the \ndevelopment partners to lend support through a series of forward-looking interventions targeting \nspecific areas. \n \n16.  Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policies. Stringent fiscal policy has helped reduce the \nbudget deficit but has squeezed development spending, which sharply declined after the onset \nof the crisis and stagnated at 2\u20133% of GDP during 1998\u20132005, as compared with 7\u20138% prior to \n1997. Over the same period, recurrent expenditures declined from about 12% of GDP to about \n9%.  In  2004,  public  expenditures  came  under  renewed  pressures  as  the  fuel  subsidies \nincreased to 3.5% of GDP, leaving less than Rp80 trillion for development expenditures. Despite \nbeing an oil-producing country, Indonesia has not been able to reap any significant gains from \nthe favorable global oil market environment due to lack of investments in oil exploration and \ndevelopment. \n  \n17.  In proportional terms, the approved 2005 budget allocations present a similar picture to \nthat of 2004, with revised fuel subsidies estimated at about Rp89.5 trillion, leaving limited \nresources for development needs. Nonetheless, the recent reduction in fuel subsidies has \nprovided the Government with significant scope to reorient public expenditures to achieve the \nGovernment\u2019s dual goal of accelerated economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n18.  Tax Framework. Businesses are required to file seven different types of tax returns \nevery month. Based on a recent survey undertaken by the World Bank, firms devote on average \n45 person-days each month for this purpose. Indonesia must move to a more streamlined tax-\nfiling system. Delayed tax refunds impose a major burden on firms, particularly small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  since  advance  tax  payments  tie  up  a  large  amount  of \nworking capital. Value-added tax (VAT) refunds alone take an average of 5 months. \n \n                                                 \n9  Eastern parts of Indonesia continue to have the highest poverty incidence in relative terms. In absolute terms, over \nhalf of Indonesia's poor reside in East Java (7.3 million), Central Java (6.8 million), and West Java (4.7 million). \nSeven other provinces account for another 25% of the poor: North Sumatra (1.8 million), Lampung (1.6 million), \nSouth Sumatra (1.4 million), South Sulawesi (1.2 million), Aceh (1.2 million), East Nusa Tenggara (1.2 million), and \nWest Nusa Tenggara (1.0 million). \n ", "    7 \n19.  Debt Management. The Government has managed to gradually decrease the level of \ndebt over the last few years, from 91% of GDP in 2000 to 52% by mid-2005. The overall debt is \nprojected to decline to about 30% of GDP by 2010. Debt sustainability analysis, undertaken by \nthe World Bank and IMF, indicate that both external and domestic public debt is fairly robust to \nshocks in exchange rates, interest rates, and GDP trends. However, considering that slightly \nmore than half of the outstanding debt, or about $66 billion, is denominated in foreign currency, \nlong-term, and owed to noncommercial lenders, one of the main risks facing Indonesia is \nexchange rate risk. Recent trends in interest rates and the move to issue sovereign bonds are \nto eventually magnify interest rate risks. The Government needs to adopt a clear strategy to \nmanage such risk as it pursues its strategy to gradually reduce overall debt. \n \n20.  Investment Constraints. After years of declining investments, signs of recovery are \nevident, although continued low investments remain a concern. The weak legal and regulatory \nframework  for  investment,  problems  of  interpretation  and  application  of  the  law  and \nenforceability  of  contractual  obligations  have  led  to  high-profile  and  high-value  investment \ndisputes, some of them concluded in favor of vested interests and involving bankruptcy litigation \nagainst well-known companies with foreign shareholding. The approval process for foreign \ninvestments by the Investment Coordinating Board is protracted. Indonesia lags other Asian \ncountries in this area: it takes 80\u2013151 days on average to register and establish a locally owned \nlimited liability company in Indonesia, compared to 56 days in Viet Nam, 41 days in the People's \nRepublic  of  China,  and  30  days  in  Malaysia.  Nontransparent  processes  leave  scope  for \ndiscretion in verification and approval of investment applications, and corruption.10\n \n21.  Infrastructure Development. While infrastructure investments in Indonesia exceeded \n5% of GDP prior to the financial crisis, they have subsequently fallen and not recovered beyond \n2-3% of GDP. Public service provision and coverage are low across all sectors, but particularly \nlow in telecommunications, roads, power, and water supply and sanitation, and in areas outside \nJava, resulting in widening economic and social disparities. The Government estimates the \ninfrastructure investment requirements at around $145 billion for 2005\u20132009. It further estimates \nthat only 17% can be financed from the national budget, and 7% by official development \nassistance, which will be largely used for promoting public-private partnerships. This means that \nthe bulk of the requirements will have to be met by private capital. The infrastructure financing \nconstraints are aggravated by the lack of depth and diversification in the financial system, which \ndoes not provide long-term capital.  \n \n22.  Investors  are  concerned  about  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  distortions  in  the \ninfrastructure  sectors,  and  face  country  risks  as  recourse  to  the  judicial  system  is  weak. \nAlthough a number of projects that halted after the crisis have been renegotiated, gaps in sector \npolicies and recent adverse outcomes, such as the annulment of the Electricity Law by the \nConstitutional Court in December 2004 have negatively affected investor confidence. Lack of \nstrong coordination across sector ministries also adversely affects infrastructure investment. \nThe National Committee for the Acceleration of Infrastructure Development (KKPPI) has been \nestablished  and  strengthened  through  a  Presidential  Decree  in  2005,  but  it  needs  strong \ntechnical and administrative support to function as an effective coordination mechanism. Due to \nthe  legal  and  country risks,  the Government  needs  to adopt  a  risk-sharing  mechanism  to \nmitigate against the legal and regulatory uncertainties faced by investors. Transaction quality \nneeds to be ensured by thorough project preparation and transparent bidding process. There is \na need for an effective mechanism for an independent and impartial review, roles that can be \nplayed only by a strong KKPPI. \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005. Improving the Investment Climate in Indonesia. Manila. \n ", "8   \n23.  Financial Sector. Indonesia\u2019s financial sector has stabilized but continues to exhibit \nstructural  vulnerabilities  and  risks.  The  financial  performance  of  Indonesia\u2019s  banks  is \ncomparable or better than other developing countries in the region and gross nonperforming \nloan ratios have declined over time from above 12% in 2001 to 7% by mid-2005, although some \nlarge state-owned commercial banks continue to carry large nonperforming loans. Financial \nintermediation is increasing, although its growth is impacted by upward pressure on interest rate \nand credit and operational risks in the system. Banks have as yet not fully adopted sound risk \nmanagement systems. Recent scandals in some banks\u2014including large state-owned banks as \nwell as smaller, reasonably well-managed private banks\u2014manifest weak corporate and financial \ngovernance practices. Lack of an effective financial safety net and liquidity support for the \nbanking system pose a systemic risk to the system.11 Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) still \naccount for a relatively low 16% of total financial assets. While the Indonesian capital market \nhas been the best performing in the region and equity market capitalization registered triple-fold \ngrowth in recent years, issues of breadth and depth of the market and enforcement of regulation \nand supervision remain a concern. The long-term debt market has been constrained by delays \nin pension and insurance sector reforms. The financial sector lacks innovation, both at the \ninstitution and product level. Much of the liquidity is locked up in Government bonds.  \n  \n24.  Financial  Management  and  Anticorruption.  The  key  concerns  in  public  financial \nmanagement  are  (i)  an  outdated  legal  environment;  (ii)  an  opaque  and  inefficient  budget \nformulation process, and the separation of recurrent and development budgets; (iii) an inefficient \npayments  system  and  weak  monitoring  arrangements;  (iv)  fragmented  cash  management \narrangements; (v) unreliable accounting, auditing, and reporting systems; and (vii) overlaps \nbetween external and internal audit agencies, reflecting unclear roles and responsibilities. Public \nand investor perception surveys (such as those by Transparency International) indicate that \ncorruption is evident at all levels in the public sector. Legal and regulatory uncertainty in most \nsectors  acts  as  a  major  impediment  to  good  governance.  Public  procurement  remains  a \nchallenging  area  of  reform;  malpractices  here  have  impeded  development  spending.  The \nPresident  has  made  corruption  eradication  a  top  priority,  and  the  establishment  of  the \nCorruption  Eradication  Commission  (KPK)  has  brought  new  hope.  Persistence  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s anticorruption efforts and sound enforcement will be vital to reducing corruption in \npublic life.  \n \nE.  Lessons Learned  \n25.  The role of adjustment lending as a vehicle for economic growth and poverty reduction \nhas come under scrutiny by a number of task forces and studies.12 This body of analytical \nliterature agrees that adjustment lending, originally conceived as a financing vehicle for short-\nterm balance of payments or budget support, has also evolved into an important development \ninstrument for supporting economic, social, and sector reforms, especially in middle-income \ncountries.  \n \n26.  Early adjustment lending had a mixed performance record. The concerns stem largely \nfrom  the  evidence  that  past  reform  programs  were  structured  around  unrealistic  and  rigid \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005.

At the same time, conditions tended to be \nnumerous and not well prioritized. Rigid reform conditionalities by themselves cannot lead to the \nadoption of effective policies in absence of consensus and ownership of reform. Rather than \nbeing prescriptive, conditionalities should be based on good diagnostic and analytical work and \ngeared to evolving country circumstances and structured around open and informed debate \nabout policy reform. \n \n27.  Many multiyear and multitranche operations have had implementation difficulties, in part \nbecause ambitious, multiyear reform agendas were in excess of the institutional capacity and \npolitical economy of the country. For example, the adjustment lending experience of the World \nBank indicates that during 1990-1999, 39% of two-tranche operations and 63% of three-tranche \noperations had waivers or cancellations.13 ADB experience has been similar. As a result, as an \nalternative,  the  World  Bank  has  now  moved  increasingly  to  a  series  of  single-tranche \noperations, with a well-defined, medium-term (programmatic) framework specified at the outset, \nincluding completed up-front reform actions and triggers for subsequent operations. The DPLs \nfit into this mold.  \n \n28.  For effective development results, the policy agenda needs to be backed by broader \npublic sector reforms that aim to address thematic and cross-cutting issues of governance, \npublic financial management, procurement, and accountability. At the same time, given the lack \nof responsiveness of the private sector to mere adoption of policies and passage of laws, the \ndevelopment  debate  advocates  emphasis  on  institutional  development,  capacity  building, \nimplementation of laws and policies, and improvements in procedures and systems. \n \n29.  In light of this evidence, evaluation studies increasingly advocate that the following steps \nare imperative when designing adjustment lending: \n \n(i)  Assess carefully the environment in which the reform agenda is planned, as well \nas the degree of country commitment, ownership, and readiness shown by the \nGovernment. \n(ii)  Ensure  that  the  development  agenda  encompasses  longer  term  economic, \nsocial, and institutional issues; and includes the flexibility to cope with emerging \nchanges and institutional problems. \n(iii)  Promote broader stakeholder participation to obtain adequate buy-in and mitigate \nvested interests. \n(iv)  Ensure that macroeconomic and fiscal stability measures adequately reinforce, \nand  are  supported  by,  a  proper  environment  for  investment,  financial \nmanagement, and governance.  \n(v)  Use  adjustment  lending  as  a  flexible  development  instrument  to  nurture  an \neffective  development  partnership  that  evolves  in  tandem  with  the  country\u2019s \nbroader  development  agendas  and  to  build  consensus  among  development \npartners on policy advice.  \n \nIII.

Improving Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness \n \n33.  The DPSP recognizes Indonesia\u2019s positive track record of macroeconomic management, \noverall stability and fiscal consolidation after the 1997 financial crisis, leading to its exit from the \nIMF-supported program in 2003. However, some fundamental changes in Government strategy \nand  policy  to  enhance  the  quality  of  fiscal  management  are  needed.  Areas  of  critical \nsignificance  targeted  under  the  DPSP  include  (i)  reducing  distortionary  fuel  subsidies,  (ii) \nreorienting public spending to support poverty reduction programs, (iii) introducing tax reforms, \n(iv)  improving  debt  management,  and  (v)  streamlining  intergovernmental  borrowing.  A \ndescription of specific policy measures and actions under these areas follows. \n \n34.  Reduction in Subsidies to the Non-Poor. The fuel subsidy program has entailed high \nfiscal and economic costs, which compounded in 2005 with oil prices spiraling to unprecedented \nlevels. Fuel prices for most products have been below international levels, with gasoline and \nkerosene at about 45% and 12% of international prices, respectively. As fuel subsidies were \nregressive, largely benefiting the middle-class and curtailing resources for productive uses, \nincluding poverty reduction, the DPSP supports their reduction from the original budgeted level \n ", "12   \nof about $13 billion to $9 billion for 2005. Following three rounds of fuel price increases in 2005, \nthe Government has cumulatively raised fuel prices by 165%, an unprecedented magnitude \nsince a 12% increase in 2000, followed by a 30% increase in 2001.16  \n \n35.  In 2005, the Government adopted the following measures to reduce subsidies to the \nnon-poor: \n \n(i)  all oil products: prices increased on average by 29% in March 2005; \n(ii)  mining-based industries: prices were brought closer to international parity in July \n2005; \n(iii)  all industrial users with an average monthly fuel consumption of 500,000 liters or \nmore: prices were brought closer to international parity in August 2005; and \n(iv)  gasoline,  automotive  diesel,  and  kerosene  for  individual  consumption:  prices \nincreased on average by 126.6% in October 2005. \n \n36.  Impact of Subsidy Reduction. The reduction in fuel subsidies will have clear medium- \nto long-term benefits. In the immediate short term, however, it will affect growth through higher \ninflation and interest rates. While the first round of subsidy reduction in March 2005 did not lead \nto a significant overall increase in inflation, the October increase in fuel prices has led to a sharp \nincrease in inflation of 18% year-on-year. In the short term, growth may be affected by Bank \nIndonesia\u2019s move to raise interest rates by 225 basis points to 12.25% in November, a measure \nthat will slow credit growth. Nonetheless, the reduction in fuel subsidy has helped contain the \nplanned fiscal deficit for 2005 at Rp48.3 trillion, or minus 0.9% of GDP, close to the target, while \nproviding a window for improving the quality of fiscal management. Incorporating the impact of \nsubsidy reduction and tax reforms, the fiscal deficit for 2006 is forecast to be 0.7% of GDP.  \n \n37.  Reorienting  Public  Expenditures.  Fiscal  consolidation  pressures,  coupled  with \nmounting fuel subsidies, have squeezed public expenditure growth. Recognizing the adverse \nconsequences of reduced public spending, under the DPSP the Government has reoriented the \nfuel subsidy savings to priority social sector and poverty reduction programs. Consistent with \nthese goals, the Government has raised the resource allocations in various areas of the 2006 \nbudget over 2005 budget allocations: \n \n(i)  development and social spending increased from 3.2% to 3.7% of GDP; \n(ii)  transfers to the regions through block grants increased from 3.3% to 4.8% of \nGDP (or Rp153.8 trillion); and \n(iii)  doubling of regional special purpose grants from Rp4.8 trillion to Rp11.6 trillion.  \n \n38.  Besides allowing for growth in public expenditures in the social sectors, in March 2005 \nthe Government began financing the Compensation Program for Reduction in Fuel Subsidies \n(PKPS) to partly mitigate the social and political consequences of the sharp rise in fuel prices, \nand to create jobs and boost growth. The PKPS includes the following: \n \n(i)  Unconditional  cash  transfers  were  made  to  15.5  million  poor  households, \namounting to $10 per household/month (payments made quarterly, with the first \nin October 2005). The full cost of the package is Rp18 trillion ($1.8 billion), of \nwhich  budget  spending  in  2005  is  close  to  Rp5  trillion.  The  transfers  are \nchanneled  to  households  with  authorized  identification  cards  through  local \nbranches of the post office and Bank Rakyat Indonesia.  \n \n                                                 \n16  A subsequent increase of 22% in January 2003 was partly rolled back by the Government of former President \nMegawati Sukarnoputri. \n ", "    13 \n(ii)  Operational aid to schools (Rp6.3 trillion in 2005) to support the rehabilitation of \ndilapidated school buildings and augments recurrent expenditures. \n \n(iii)  Basic  health  care  and  health  insurance  (Rp3.9  trillion  in  2005)  to  finance \nupgrading of health care facilities and insurance schemes for the poor. \n \n(iv)  Upgrading  of  village  infrastructure  (Rp3.3  trillion  in  2005)  to  support  priority \ninfrastructure development in 12,800 villages in 427 districts (covering 20% of all \nvillages and 45% of all poor villages). Each village receives a block grant of \nRp250 million ($25,000) to finance roads, irrigation schemes, water supply and \nsanitation, and small fish-landing facilities. The village infrastructure scheme is \nmanaged and implemented by local communities. \n \n39.  Impact  of  Public  Expenditure  Reorientation.  As  of  15  November  2005,  the \nGovernment had distributed Rp3.7 trillion ($370 million) in first quarter cash compensation \ntransfers to 13.3 million households.17 Disbursements have started under the other schemes. \nThe village infrastructure scheme, in particular, will have a significant multiplier effect on the \nlocal communities as the workers will be from the local communities and procurement needs will \nlikely be sourced locally. To support the implementation of the village infrastructure scheme, \naimed at poverty reduction, the Government and ADB have designed the Rural Infrastructure \nSupport Project.18\n \n40.  Tax Reforms. As a part of the DPSP process, the Government has modernized tax \nadministration, and over the course of 2003\u20132005 formulated a far-reaching tax policy package, \nwhich was finalized and submitted to Parliament in October 2005. This package, involving \nextensive consultations with stakeholders, entails amendments to three primary laws: Income \nTax Law 17/2000, the Value-Added Tax Law 18/2000, and General Tax Administration Law \n16/2000. The tax policy package broadens the tax base and restructures tax brackets, while \nlowering rates to encourage investment and increase compliance. The measures taken by the \nGovernment under the DPSP include: \n \n(i)  Tax administration reforms focused on (a) expansion and modernization of key \ntax offices, including building and computer infrastructure upgrading in tax offices \nin  Jakarta,  reorganization  of  staff  by  function  and  increase  of  remuneration, \nappointment of special account representatives, and institutionalization of the \ntax-payer bill of rights and the code of conduct for tax officials in the modernized \noffices, (b) additional tax payers registered and in December 2004 the first pilot \nsmall taxpayer office established, patterned after the highly successful Large \nTaxpayers Office experiment introduced in 2003, and (c) electronic registration of \ntaxpayers and electronic filing of returns, introduced in January 2005. \n \n(ii)  Income tax changes comprising (a) introduction of a single corporate income tax \nrate, to be set at 30%, and gradually reduced to 25% by 2010, (b) reduction of \nthe maximum income tax rate for individuals gradually from 35% to 25% by 2010, \n(c) increase in the income tax bracket from Rp2.9 million to Rp10 million to \nbenefit low-income earners, and (d) reduction in tax on dividends from 35% to \n15% by 2010 to encourage investment. \n \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "14   \n(iii)  Tax incentives include introduction of tax incentives from 2007 to investments in \nmining, oil, gas, and geothermal sectors; as well as to microenterprises, SMEs, \nand businesses organized on Shariah (Islamic) principles.  \n \n(iv)  The VAT will be extended to new areas (such as mining), while exempting others \n(such as securitization, leasing, electricity and water, and Shariah banking).  \n \n(v)  Taxes will be increased on luxury goods and services up to 200% from the \ncurrent 75%. \n \n(vi)  Procedural changes in the Tax Administration Law will (a) reduce the statutory \nlimit  for  tax  assessment  from  10  years  to  5  years,  (b)  allow  for  automatic \nextension of filing deadlines for corporate income tax, (c) exempt publicly listed \ncompanies from separate tax audits as their taxes are required to be audited by \npublic  accountants,  (d)  waive  the  requirement  that  every  refund  request  be \naudited,  and  (e)  allow  for  greater  oversight  of  the  Tax  Department  by  the \ninspector general of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). \n \n41.  Impact of Tax Reforms. The tax reform measures are not revenue neutral; independent \nestimates suggest they could result in a tax revenue loss of up to 0.5% of GDP. However, the \nGovernment expects to offset this potential loss in revenue through better compliance and \ntightening of tax administration. Tax receipts to date in 2005 are considerably above 2004 \nlevels; non-oil taxes to the end of August 2005 increased by 26%. Revenue gains are likely to \nemerge more fully next year with full expansion in the tax base and better registration. Owing to \nmeasures adopted by the Government, the number of taxpayers has steadily increased, from \n1.98 million in 2000 to 3.67 million at the end of 2004, and to 10 million as of October 2005. \n \n42.  The  public  perception  of  the  tax  system  is  improving.  An  independent  survey  in \nSeptember 2005 by the Large Taxpayers Office found that 81% of taxpayers were satisfied with \noverall services; 84% found tax filing easier, and 78% reported they have seen positive changes \nin tax officer behavior.19 The revisions to the Tax Administration Law, however, have been \ncontroversial. The business community has expressed serious concerns on increased powers \nbeing given to tax authorities, including the possible use of criminal sanctions against taxpayers.  \n \n43.  Improving Debt Management. Under the DPSP, the Government has adopted and \nsubmitted to Parliament the decree on State Debt Management Strategy 2005\u20132009 (MOF \ndecree 06/2005). The decree \n \n(i)  mandates the Government to adopt a cost-effective and prudent approach to \ndebt  management  through  adequate  diversification  and  hedging  against \ncurrency, maturity, interest rate, and investor and creditor risks; \n(ii)  sets out broad directions for decision-making on borrowing and debt buy-back; \nand \n(iii)  provides  guidelines  on  transparency  and  public  accountability  of  debt  policy \nmanagement,  and  outlines  measures  to  strengthen  the  professionalism  and \n                                                 \n19  AC Nielson conducted the survey. While cross-country comparisons are not straightforward, similar surveys \nconducted by the same company in other countries indicate the overall satisfaction in Indonesia to be relatively \nhigher, with Australia and Hong Kong, China scoring 70%; Singapore 76%; and India 78%. The survey in \nIndonesia covered (i) advice and counseling, (ii) filing and payment, (iii) tax audit and reviews, (iv) audit follow-up \nand collection, (v) objection management, (vi) refund system, and (vii) overall complaint resolution. Survey findings \nshow need for improvement in objection management (41% satisfaction rating) and audit follow-up and collection \n(63% satisfaction rating).  \n ", "    15 \nperformance of the state debt management institutions within MOF that oversee \nexternal loans and the Government\u2019s treasury instruments.   \n \n44.  The Government also has formulated a coherent strategy for managing its portfolio of \ntreasury instruments, focused on \n \n(i)  balancing the maturity structure and lengthening the average maturity;  \n(ii)  reducing  refinancing  risk,  mainly  during  2005/09  given  the  current  maturity \nprofile; \n(iii)  developing  and  enhancing  liquidity  in  the  secondary  market  to  shift  the \nGovernment bond yield curve downward and reduce refinancing costs; and  \n(iv)  maintaining a prudent stock of domestic debt by periodically conducting buy-\nbacks in the secondary market. \n \n45.  Implementation of this strategic framework is well under way. The Government, with IMF \ntechnical  support,  has  adopted  a  framework  to  assess  external  debt  sustainability.  The \nGovernment has in place a system for publishing consolidated debt reports containing data on \nexternal and domestic debt\u2014with the latest one available for the second quarter of 2005.20  \n \n46.  Impact of Improved Debt Management. The Government\u2019s debt management strategy \nis yielding results. Overall public debt has fallen from 91% of GDP in 2000 to 59% in 2003, and \nto 52% by June 2005. During 2000\u20132005, the outstanding domestic debt declined from 47% of \nGDP to 25%, and external debt from 44% to 27%. Public sector debt has been reprofiled, \neffectively resulting in the amount of commercial debt being managed comprising 2\u20133% of \noverall external debt. Maturities have been lengthened with average time to maturity increasing \nfrom  5.9  years  in  2000  to  7.4  years  in  June  2005.  Sound  fiscal  and  macroeconomic \nmanagement has allowed Indonesia to expand its access to domestic, and reenter international, \ndebt markets. However, while debt-service costs have declined to 6% of GDP, they still account \nfor 53% of the non-oil revenues and 42% of primary spending. Given the relatively high debt-\nservice burden and the exchange rate and interest rate vulnerabilities, Indonesia has committed \nto gradually reducing its debt level. The Government\u2019s medium-term target is to reduce its public \ndebt to 30% of GDP by 2010, although debt-threshold assessments indicate a debt level in the \nrange of 35\u201342% of GDP would be appropriate (Appendix 6). The Government's approach to \ngradual debt reduction will release additional resources for public expenditure and poverty \nreduction programs. In quantitative terms, the Government's current strategy would reduce the \ndebt stock by about $11 billion\u2013$16 billion annually through 2006\u20132010, which could provide a \nsignificant expenditure cushion. \n  \n47.  Streamlining Intergovernmental Transfers. Complementing decentralization reforms \nsupported by ADB,21 the Government is taking additional steps to streamline onlending and \nongranting mechanisms for regional governments under the DPSP. Based on policy dialogue \nand extensive interministerial consultations, the regulatory framework being adopted by the \nGovernment will set out the following provisions and procedures: \n \n(i)  onlending to be permissible for revenue-generating projects, while ongranting will \nbe  determined  on  a  selective  basis  to  support  key  social  service  delivery \ninitiatives; \n(ii)  resolution of outstanding loan arrears;  \n                                                 \n20  The latest report published is for second quarter 2005. With World Bank technical assistance support, the \nGovernment is developing a website to provide timely and consolidated data on domestic and foreign debt. \n21 ADB. 2005.

Three Government regulations defining these issues are now complete, and have been \nchecked for consistency, approved by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, and submitted for \nthe President\u2019s endorsement. As part of the DPSP, MOF has drafted an implementation decree \non onlending, setting out the business process for streamlined institutional arrangements. This \ndecree  will  be  endorsed  by  the  minister  of  finance  upon  Presidential  endorsement  of  the \nregulatory framework.  \n \n49.  Impact  of  Streamlining  Intergovernmental  Transfers.  The  new  measures,  to  be \neffective from 2006, will lead to qualitative changes in the planning and budgeting process: (i) \nsector  ministries  and  regional  governments  will  have  up-front  clarity  on  the  Government\u2019s \npriorities for local government projects and their sources of financing; (ii) assessment and \napproval process for onlending will be simpler and shorter, subject to compliance with project \nreadiness and financial soundness criteria; and (iii) public service delivery will be improved at \nthe decentralized levels, through a more systematic project approval process.  \n \n2.  Improving the Investment Climate \n \n50.  Strengthening Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework for Investments.22 \nAs part of the DPSP, specific measures taken by the Government to strengthen investment \nenvironment include \n \n(i)  drafting and finalizing a new investment law23 that (a) creates a unified national \nframework law covering all investments, (b) states the principle of equal treatment \nof all investors, (c) streamlines the entry of new investors by moving from an \napproval-oriented system to a simple registration framework, (d) simplifies the \nregistration process to reduce the time required, (e) stipulates a negative list of \ninvestments that is short and clear, (f) reaffirms free repatriation of capital, (g) \nallows for the use of dispute resolution mechanisms, (h) reaffirms the principle of \nno expropriation without compensation, (i) permits the use of foreign expertise, (j) \nprovides a foundation for investment promotion and facilitation, (k) removes the \n                                                 \n22 In addition, the World Bank\u2019s DPL-2 Board document also cross-refers to an ADB-supported condition relating to \nstreamlining of regional taxation by amending the Law on Regional Taxes and Charges, under an ongoing ADB \nProgram (footnote 21). \n23 Previous efforts to introduce a new law (including under ADB\u2019s Industrial Competitiveness and SME loan) were \nconstrained by lack of consensus within the Government, inadequate coordination, and the political transition in \n2003\u20132004 (ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed \nLoan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Industrial  Competitiveness  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment Program. Manila).  \n ", "    17 \nlimited  duration  of  investments,  and  (l)  abolishes  the  system  of  forced \ndivestments; \n(ii)  strengthening the National Team for Increasing Exports and Investments, chaired \nby the President, by empowering it to formulate investment policies and resolve \nkey constraints faced by the private sector; and \n(iii)  working  to  resolve  high-profile  investment  disputes;  following  months  of \nuncertainty, an agreement was signed in September 2005 by Pertamina and \nExxon Mobil on the development of a new oil field in Cepu, Central Java. The \nGovernment remains committed to resolve several other high-profile disputes. \n \n51.  Infrastructure Reforms. The reform measures introduced under the DPSP in this area \ninclude the following: \n \n(i)  Enhance institutional coordination to promote private sector participation (PSP) \nand  public-private  partnerships  (PPP)  in  infrastructure  development  by \nstrengthening KKPPI. A new Presidential decree (No. 42/2005) adopted under \nthe DPSP will strengthen the role and authority of KKPPI.24 It will help ensure a \nconsistent approach to PSP across the infrastructure sectors and efficient use of \npublic and private funds by sector ministries and local governments. The new \nDecree will help KKPPI to be more effective in (a) formulating strategies and \npolicies to accelerate infrastructure development through the public and private \nsectors, (b) coordinating and supervising the implementation of these strategies \nand policies by the sector ministries and local governments, (c) formulating an \nimplementation  policy  on  public  service  obligation  for  infrastructure,  and  (d) \nresolving problems that impede infrastructure development. KKPPI will have two \nsecretariats25 to effectively coordinate between key sector ministries in PSP and \nPPP projects. \n \n(ii)  Strengthen  the  regulatory  framework  for  PSP  through  replacing  the  earlier \nPresidential decree (No. 7/1998) by a Presidential regulation (No. 67/2005). The \nnew Regulation facilitates PSP by (a) defining two forms of PSP: partnerships or \nlicensing  agreements,  (b)  stipulating  the  rules  and  procedures  for  selecting \nprivate sponsors through open and transparent bidding, and (c) outlining an \napproach for dispute resolution. PPP projects can be identified and prepared \neither by the Government or the private sector, but the sponsors have to be \nselected on a competitive basis. The Decree outlines the rules and procedures \nfor the bidding process. Tariffs should be set for full cost recovery. If this exceeds \ncustomer\u2019s affordability to pay, the difference is to be compensated by a public \nservice obligation subsidy from the Government. Risks should be allocated to the \nparty that is best able to manage and control them. \n \n(iii)  Establish  a  risk  management  committee  on  infrastructure  provision  in  MOF \n(through  decree  No.  518/KMK.01/2005)  to  (a)  develop  a  risk  management \nframework to assess, price, monitor, and manage the contingent liabilities that \narise from selective guarantees for PPP projects, (b) link the framework to the \n                                                 \n24  KKPPI, which reports directly to the President, is cochaired by the coordinating minister of economic affairs and the \nstate  minister  of  national  development  planning/chairperson  of  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS), the latter acting as the executive chair. Its members include the ministers of finance, home affairs, \nenergy and mineral resources, public works, transportation, communications and informatics, and state-owned \nenterprises, as well as the cabinet secretary. \n25  Headed by the deputy minister for infrastructure and  regional development in the Coordinating Ministry of \nEconomic Affairs and the deputy minister for infrastructure in BAPPENAS. \n \n ", "18   \nexisting budgeting, fiscal accounting, and debt management systems; (c) ensure \na proper alignment of risks in individual PPP projects between public and private \nsectors, and (d) effectively manage the Government\u2019s overall exposure in PPP \nprojects. The committee will perform the actual risk management functions until a \nformal  permanent  unit  is  established,  including  examining  requests  for \nGovernment  support  for  PPP  projects  approved  by  KKPPI,  setting  the \nperformance targets for partnership and licensing agreements, and monitoring \nperformance of PPP projects during their operation. \n \n52.  Impact of Infrastructure Reforms. With the measures taken under the DPSP, the legal \nand institutional frameworks for PSP and risk management are in place. The Government has \nthus fulfilled its commitment made at the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit in January 2005 to \nprovide  a  predictable  environment,  level  playing  field,  and  risk-sharing  arrangements.  The \nchallenge now is to fully operationalize these new frameworks and institutions. The latter need \nextensive capacity building to fulfill their mandate.26  \n \n53.  Progress with project transactions has so far not met expectations. Of the 91 projects \noffered  to private  investors  at  the  Indonesia Infrastructure  Summit,  only  four  water  supply \nprojects are under construction, and contracts have been awarded for four toll roads. Apart from \nthat, prequalification and bidding are underway for 13 toll roads, seven power plants, three gas \npipelines, six water supply projects, one port, two airports, one ferry terminal, and one railway. \nThe main reasons for not having achieved more contract awards and financial closings are \ninadequate project preparation, lack of central coordination, and the uncertainties still faced by \ninvestors.  With  the  recent  completion  of  the  PSP  and  risk  management  frameworks  that \naddress these problems, the execution of PPP projects is expected to accelerate. Another \nimportant boost for infrastructure development will come from the recent sharp reduction of fuel \nsubsidies, which not only frees large resources for public investments in rural infrastructure and \nother noncommercial projects, but also provides a favorable environment for PSP in domestic \ngas market development by removing distortions in fuel prices. \n \n54.  Adopting a Medium-Term Action Plan for SME Development. The Government aims \nto  provide  a  stable  policy  and  regulatory  environment  for  SME  development  to  promote \neconomic growth, employment, and poverty reduction. As part of the DPSP, in February 2005 \nthe Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs adopted the SME Empowerment Action Program for \n2005\u20132009 to facilitate the establishment of new SMEs and cooperatives through adequate \nstart-up services and incentives, and strengthen the provision of business development services \nthrough formation of SME clusters. In addition, the Government has made an initial allocation of \nRp0.42  trillion  ($42  million)  from  the  PKPS  to  be  channeled  through  savings  and  loan \ncooperatives in over 5,000 villages to help stimulate micro and small enterprises. \n \n55.  Impact of Medium-Term Action Plan for SME Development. The Government has \nkeenly focused on job creation. Through the new action program, about 6 million new micro and \nsmall  enterprises  are  expected  to  be  created  by  2009,  up  from  the  40  million  estimated \nregistered and unregistered enterprises operating at present. Employment in microenterprises \nand SMEs has grown at an average annual rate of 3.1% since 2000. The Government\u2019s action \nprogram, supported under the DPSP, envisages creating about 15 million new jobs, to support \nits aim of halving open unemployment from 9.9% in 2004 to 5.1% in 2009. The action program \nwill also help strengthen the network of 70,000 cooperatives serving over 20 million members.   \n                                                 \n26 ADB will provide capacity building for the BAPPENAS part of the KKPPI secretariat through a proposed technical \nassistance for $2 million (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic Indonesia on Support for Infrastructure \nDevelopment (draft). Manila). The World Bank has been supporting the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs \npart of the KKPPI secretariat and the sector ministries through its $17.3 million loan for the Private Provision of \nInfrastructure Technical Assistance. \n ", "    19 \n \n3.  Developing and Strengthening Financial System \n \n56.  Although  Indonesia\u2019s  financial  system  has  recovered  and  been  substantially \nconsolidated, the sector faces lingering fragilities in the wake of structural weaknesses and \nvulnerabilities. Under the DPSP, the Government, with technical and advisory support of ADB, \nWorld Bank, IMF, and other development partners, has managed to develop a strategy and \ninstitutional  mechanism  for  a  financial  safety  net  (FSN),  strengthened  the  prudential  and \nregulatory framework for banks, and taken steps to promote product and industry diversification, \nprincipally through NBFIs.  \n \n57.  Development of the FSN. To provide greater financial stability and restore public sector \nconfidence  in  the  banking  system,  the  Government  announced  a  three-pillar  FSN  system \nincluding  a  formal  deposit  insurance  scheme,  a  lender  of  last  resort  facility,  and  a  bank \nresolution  framework.  Specific  measures  include  the  enactment  of  the  Law  on  Deposit \nInsurance  in  June  2004,  which  prepared  for  the  establishment  of  the  Deposit  Insurance \nCompany (LPS) in October 2005.27 Replacing the blanket guarantee, which was fully phased \nout in September 2005,28 LPS will (i) provide full insurance coverage to all eligible deposits in \nthe first 6 months (until March 2006), (ii) lower this coverage to deposits up to Rp5 billion over \nthe next 6 months (until September 2006), and (iii) lower the coverage to Rp1 billion after 1 year \n(until March 2007). LPS will cover only deposits up to Rp100 million from March 2007 onward. \nConcurrently, Bank Indonesia set up the Lender of Last Resort Facility to provide short-term \nliquidity support and emergency liquidity support to solvent banks in case of any systemic risks \nto the system. The Financial Stability Forum\u2014a joint initiative being developed by MOF, Bank \nIndonesia, and LPS\u2014will deliberate on the role, functions, and institutional arrangements for a \nbank resolution system. \n \n58.  Enhancing Financial Stability. With over 130 banks in the system and the relatively \nhigh  asset  concentration  in  the  top  20  banks,  Bank  Indonesia  issued  a  new  plan\u2014the \nIndonesian  Banking  Architecture\u2014in  2004  with  a  range  of  measures  to  strengthen  the \nprudential and risk management framework of the banking system, improve asset quality of \nbanks, and enhance public and consumer confidence. Bank Indonesia plans to implement these \nmeasures  during  2004\u20132009.  In  parallel,  Bank  Indonesia  initiated  measures  to  gradually \nimplement  the  new  supervisory  framework  set  out  by  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking \nSupervision  during  2007\u20132011,  with  advance  actions  taken  during  2005\u20132006.  During  the \ncourse of the DPSP, the specific measures by Bank Indonesia include \n \n(i)  introduction of the Regulation on Minimum Capital Requirements (7/15/PBI/2005) \nin July 2005 requiring all banks to comply with a tier 1 capital requirement of no \nless than Rp80 billion ($8 million) by 31 December 2007 and no less than Rp100 \nbillion ($10 million) by 31 December 2010; \n(ii)  issuance of Payment System Regulation 7/22/2005 to strengthen the provision of \nintraday liquidity support to commercial banks; the new facility will reduce the \nburden on the real time gross settlement system by providing interim support as \nthe clearance process takes place through this system; \n(iii)  drafting of a regulation on good corporate governance (with adoption by Bank \nIndonesia\u2019s  Board  envisaged  in  early  2006),  stipulating  fitness  criteria  for \nmanagement,  code  of  conduct  for  the  board  of  directors  and  board  of \ncommissioners, and requirements for the auditing committee and other standards \nin line with the Basel Committee Guidelines on good corporate governance and \n                                                 \n27  LPS will have a capitalization of Rp4 trillion. \n28  In April 2005, the Government started limiting the blanket guarantee only to saving deposits and interbank loans, \nand finally by September 2005 the coverage for interbank loans was removed. \n ", "20   \nthe  revised  good  corporate  governance  principles  of  the  Organization  for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development; \n(iv)  adoption  of  the  Regulation  for  Risk  Management  Certification  7/25/PBI/2005 \nstipulating competency requirements for all bank managers and members of the \nboard of commissioners dealing with risk management; \n(v)  adoption of the Regulation on Asset Securitization 7/4/2005 to facilitate effective \ncredit risk and liquidity management by commercial banks; the regulation sets \nout the principle, criteria, and mechanism for asset securitization, which will in \nturn help portfolio management as well as product diversification in the broader \nfinancial sector;  \n(vi)  establishment of a Credit Information Bureau (regulation 7/8/2005) in August \n2005, to upgrade Bank Indonesia\u2019s in-house credit information system; the new \nbureau  has  in  place  a  debtor  information  system,  with  complete  and \ncomprehensive debtor profiles, starting with negative information; and \n(vii)  adoption of consumer protection measures to (a) enhance transparency in bank \nproduct  information  and  use  of  personal  customer  data  by  banks    (through \nregulation 7/6/PBI/2005), and (b) stipulate mechanisms for resolution of customer \ncomplaints, and for subsequent monitoring to ensure that follow-up remedial \nactions are implemented (through regulation 7/7/PBI/2005). \n \n59.  Impact of FSN and Enhanced Financial Stability. The immediate impact of some of   \nthese measures may be muted due to the prevailing high interest rate environment, which has \ncut the interest margins and profitability of banks since December 2004. However, the timely \nestablishment  of  LPS  and  gradual  phase-out  of  the  blanket  guarantee  have  proceeded \nsmoothly. The FSN and regulatory measures taken under the DPSP will help strengthen risk \nmanagement and asset quality during 2006\u20132007.  \n \n60.  Undertake Measures to Strengthen NBFIs. As part of the policy dialogue under the \nDPSP, the Government has taken several actions in its first year aimed at strengthening capital \nmarket  regulation,  especially  in  the  area  of  mutual  funds  (disclosure  and  transparency  of \nprospectus, advertisements, accounting practices, and adoption of market-to-market principle in \nnet  asset  value  calculation).  However,  the  mutual  fund  industry  continues  to  face  serious \nproblems of rapid redemptions. ADB has been closely involved in developing the regulatory \nframework for pensions and insurance. In 2005, as part of the DPSP, the Government has \ntaken steps to strengthen the industry: all operators of pension funds are now required to be \ncertified; and MOF has continued strict regulatory measures against several small insolvent \ninsurance companies.  \n \n61.  With regard to capital markets, a development master plan is in place. In December \n2004, the Government adopted the Non-Bank Financial Sector Action Plan as part of the ADB-\nsupported Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program.29 Implementation of the \naction plan is under way, with good progress made in some areas, including regulatory actions \nin  the  insurance  sector  and  harmonization  between  Bank  Indonesia  and  MOF.  Facilitated \nthrough policy dialogue under the DPSP, a Presidential decree (no.63/2005) was signed in \nOctober 2005, to merge the Directorate General of Financial Institutions in MOF which oversees \npension, insurance and finance companies with the Capital Market Supervision Agency. The \nGovernment has committed to strengthen the merged institution during the course of 2006. \nThese outcomes would ensure continuity of reforms initiated in 2000-2002 with ADB support, \naimed at consolidating financial sector supervision and facilitating regulatory harmonization. \n \n                                                 \n29  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "    21 \n62.  Impact of Measures to Strengthen NBFIs. The institutional and regulatory reforms \nunder the DPSP need to be supplemented by market and product development in the NBFI \nsector.  The  high  demand  for  infrastructure  investments  is  expected  to  provide  investment \nopportunities, catalyze growth of fixed-income instruments, and lead to the development of \nmore financing options over the course of 2005\u20132009.  \n \n4.  Improving Public Financial Management and Strengthening Anticorruption \nInitiatives \n \n63.  Strengthen Regulatory Framework to Promote Transparency and Accountability. \nUnder the DPSP, the Government has achieved the following: \n \n(i)  completed all regulations required under the State Finance Law (17/2003), with \nthe recent adoption of regulations on Government accounting standards; \n \n(ii)  adopted 6 of the 12 implementing regulations required for the State Treasury \nLaw; of the remaining, the most critical, including the regulation on autonomous \nservice  agencies  (hospitals,  universities  and  other  service  institutions),  cash \nmanagement,  and  financial  and  performance  reporting  (for  Government \nagencies), have been submitted to the Ministry of Law and Human Rights for \nreview  and  final  submission  to  the  President  for  approval;  the  pending \nregulations  on  budget  execution  and  internal  controls  (across  the  entire \ngovernment) are being finalized; and  \n \n(iii)  in  the  more  complex  area  of  audit,  involving  both  state  and  Parliamentary \ninstitutions, the drafting of the seven implementing regulations for the 2004 State \nAudit Law is under way.  \n \n64.  Consolidated Government Cash Management. As part of the DPSP, the Government \nhas finalized a timetable and an implementation plan for the treasury single account (TSA) and \nthe consolidation of all central Government accounts.30 These form part of the overall Treasury \nwork plan, prepared with IMF support. In the work plan, the Government has fixed a timetable to \nextend the zero daily account balance pilot required to operationalize the TSA to all local state \ntreasury service offices (KPKN). The work plan also sets out a schedule for rationalizing bank \naccounts currently outside the control of the Directorate General of Treasury, including the oil \nresources transitory account and accounts under the regional development account system, \nwhich deals with intergovernmental borrowing transactions. Effective consolidation of accounts \nbeyond MOF will require the additional legal authority of the cash management regulation, \nwhich will confer the authority to obtain information on all Government bank accounts and close \nthem leading to consolidation. In addition, the Government successfully established a pilot of \nthe zero balance bank account process at a KPKN in Jakarta in July 2005. MOF plans to extend \nthis pilot to two additional KPKNs from December 2005. \n \n65.  Strengthen  Internal  Controls  to  Enhance  Transparency.  Under  the  DPSP,  the \nGovernment operationalized the investigation unit within the Inspector General (IG)\u2019s Office in \nMOF, and vested it with the legal powers to investigate all MOF employees. The unit has \nadequate authority and resources, based on an MOF decree; all its officials have gone through \na polygraph test to ensure integrity. The minister of finance has approved special allowances \ndesigned to improve organizational incentives.  \n                                                 \n30 The establishment of the TSA system will help improve the Government\u2019s cash management, in particular by \neventually bringing all off-budget accounts inside and outside of MOF into a single, daily zero-balance account. \nThe implementation plan and timetable adopted provide for a periodic census of all government bank accounts, \nand gradual transfer of the individual accounts into the TSA.    \n ", "22   \n \n66.  Impact of Improved Financial Management and Internal Controls. The impact of \nmeasures supported under the DPLs and DPSP should be seen in the broader context of the \nGovernment\u2019s own efforts to improve governance and combat corruption. More directly, the IG\u2019s \ninvestigation unit has undertaken 39 investigations, 35 are complete with 28 findings of guilt \nleading  to sanctions  against  67  people.  In  addition,  the  IG\u2019s  Office  has  memorandums  of \nunderstanding  with  the  Corruption  Eradication  Commission  (KPK)  and  tax  and  customs \nadministrations.  The  proposed  Tax  Law  amendments  have  clauses  that  strengthen  legal \ncertainty for the IG\u2019s Office.  \n \n67.  At a broader level, the Government\u2019s emphasis on anticorruption and establishment of \nthe  KPK  are  beginning  to  yield  results.  Recent  convictions  of  the  former  governor  of  the \nprovince of Aceh and members and staff of the General Election Commission are some of the \nkey successes of the KPK. The Government has also pursued scandals in Bank Mandiri and \nBank Negara Indonesia in a vigilant manner. KPK recently launched a sting operation in the \nSupreme Court to investigate the alleged payment of bribes of $1.6 million to judges and court \nofficials. These outcomes are bound to positively influence investments. However, significant \nnegative  perception  continues  among  investors,  given  the  general  legal  and  regulatory \nuncertainties and lack of good governance in major Government departments. This is clearly an \narea where the Government needs to pursue reforms in a vigorous manner, as recognized in \nthe development policy letter (Appendix 2). Appendix 7 presents the outcomes and challenges \nin the governance and anticorruption areas.  \n \nC.  Forward Looking Program \n  \n68.  The development policy letter (Appendix 2) sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for \nthe  next  1\u20132  years  building  on  the  reform  momentum  of  the  DPSP.  The  forward-looking \nprogram includes the following commitments: \n \n1.  Macroeconomic and Creditworthiness  \n \n69.  Establishment of a Fiscal Policy Office. The office will be responsible for development \nof a medium-term fiscal framework and provide policy advice to the minister of finance and the \ntax, budget, and treasury functions within MOF. The office will have a sound organizational \nstructure, terms of reference for individual positions, and budget to be fully operational in 2007. \nIts functions will include analysis of proposed tax, tariff, and financial market policies; improved \nquality and usefulness of information on corporate and individual taxpayers (with due attention \nto confidentiality sufficient for effective tax forecasting and policy analysis); and improved tariff-\nsetting processes. \n \n70.  Assessment of Contingent Liabilities. To implement the debt management strategy \nholistically,  the  Government  will  assess  implicit  and  explicit  contingent  liabilities,  such  as \npension liabilities and guarantees, monitor the overall debt by quantifying its costs and risks on \npublic debt, and publish periodic integrated (domestic and foreign) debt reports. For regional \ngovernment  debt,  the  Government  will  adopt  improved  procedures  for  the  loan  work-out \nprocedures and a framework for issuance of debt instruments, within the broader framework of \noverall debt management.  \n \n2.  Improve the Investment Climate \n \n71.  Improve Public Transparency and Enhance Financial Soundness. The Government \nwill issue a new law on the regional government enterprises which, among others, will define \ntheir legal status, their fiscal and financial relationship with regional governments (including the \n ", "    23 \ntreatment of continent liabilities relating to regional government enterprises in local government \nbudgets), and modalities for their operational and financial restructuring. As some of these \nenterprises provide essential public services, such as water supply and sanitation, a separate \nlaw on their status will facilitate service provision as well as PSP.  \n \n72.  Strengthen the Regulatory Framework to Attract Investments. The Government will \nissue implementing regulations to support the effective implementation of the Investment Law, \nwhich will, among others, involve creating a transparent negative list and shifting from a system \nof approvals to registration, requiring a reduction in business start-up time from 151 days to 30 \ndays by simplifying the company formation process, and revitalizing the National Team for the \nDevelopment of Exports and Investment.  \n \n73.  Introduce  Proactive  Risk  Mitigation  Measures  to  Attract  Infrastructure \nInvestments. In the 2007 budget, MOF will provide for specific budgetary allocation for public \nsupport  to  PPP  transactions  in  infrastructure  including  both  cash  items  (i.e.,  supplemental \nsubsidies), and noncash items (i.e., guarantees and other forms of contingent liabilities) if any.   \n \n74.  Enhance Regional Competitiveness. The Government will draft a trade bill that will \naim to lay out a framework for enhancing domestic and international competitiveness and \nlaunch efforts to monitor progress in this area.  \n \n  3.  Financial Sector Reforms \n \n75.  Improve  Public  Confidence.  Through  the  Deposit  Insurance  Company,  the \nGovernment will continue implementing the FSN, including lowering the coverage of the deposit \nguarantee scheme to Rp1 billion by September 2006 as per the announced schedule. \n \n76.  Enhance Financial Stability. The Government and Bank Indonesia will finalize the \ninstitutional arrangements  for  bank  closing  and  emergency  operations  through  agreements \nbetween the relevant agencies, and establishment of a financial sector stability forum. \n \n77.  Promote Product and Sector Diversification. The Government will finalize and adopt \nan  NBFI  strategy  to  diversify  the  financial  sector,  and  help  meet  long-term  needs  for \ninfrastructure financing.  \n \n4.  Public Financial Management and Anticorruption \n78.  Streamline Budget Preparation  and Disbursements. The introduction of the new \nbudget  classification  and  disbursement  system  in  2005  has  led  to  serious  delays  in \ndevelopment financing. While the procedural problems have been corrected, a major underlying \nstructural weakness is in reporting of budget outturns from budget agencies to MOF in a timely \nmanner. The forward-looking program will institutionalize a quarterly reporting system on budget \nspending by line agencies. The Government will also aim to improve the quality of budgeting \nprocess  at  entry,  by  reviewing  program  structures  and  provide  improved  guidance  to  line \nagencies in moving to a functional medium-term expenditure framework, requiring draft budget \nrequirements to be submitted by the end of 2006 for preparing the 2008 budget. \n \n79.  Cash Management Account Consolidation. Building on progress under the DPSP, \nMOF will gradually expand the coverage of all Government accounts under the TSA framework, \nwith the expectation of covering at least 75% of the treasury transactions \n \n80.  Transparency in Reporting. In line with the new Government accounting standards, \nthe Government will improve the quality and timeliness of complete reporting on financial assets \n ", "24   \nand liabilities of all line ministries, and establish a system for reconciling reports on financial \ntransactions.  \n \n81.  Anticorruption.  The  Government  will  focus  its  efforts  on  improving  the  public \nprocurement process. The President of Indonesia has taken an active interest in procurement \npolicy, emphasizing its importance in ensuring good governance and anticorruption, and has \ndirected  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  to  establish  a  high-level  procurement \npolicy body that reports directly to him. In line with this, and building on progress made in public \nprocurement through the adoption of the Presidential decree on procurement in 2003, the \nGovernment aims to set up a national procurement policy office that will consolidate the policy \nand regulatory functions in this area. In parallel, the Government will also develop an electronic \nprocurement system and disseminate procurement and bidding documents. \n \n5.  Public Service Delivery \n82.  Improve  Poverty  Orientation  of  Public  Spending.  The  Government  (through \nBAPPENAS) will monitor the effectiveness and undertake independent operational assessment, \nincluding the fiduciary aspects, of the new compensation programs: the unconditional cash \ntransfers and PKPS, with the aim of improving the impact of public expenditures on poverty \nreduction  and  achievement  of  MDGs,  and  ensuring  that  the  benefits  reach  the  intended \nbeneficiaries. In parallel, the Government plans to enhance and modify unconditional cash \ntransfer schemes to develop more effective conditional cash transfer systems.31  \n \nD.  Medium-Term Outcome Indicators for the DPSP \n \n83.  The Government and the development partners have agreed on a range of outcome \nindicators to monitor DPSP implementation and evaluate its impact, within the overall DPL \nframework (Table 3).   \n  \nTable 3: Medium-Term Outcome Indicators for the Development Policy Support Program \n \nMedium-Term Targets  Baseline Data  Current Status \n(by end-2007)  (end-2003)  (as of November 2005) \nImproved Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness \n(cid:131) Continued budget deficit at or  (cid:131) Budget deficit at 1.7% of GDP  (cid:131) Budget deficit projected at 0.8% \nbelow 1.0% of GDP  in 2003  of GDP in 2005; 2006 budget \nprojected to be below 1% \n(cid:131) Mobilize between 0.6% and  (cid:131) Domestic non-oil and gas tax  (cid:131) Domestic non-oil and gas \n0.9% of GDP in additional  revenues at 9.7% of GDP in  revenues remain at 9.7% of GDP \nnon-oil and gas revenues  2003  in 2004; projected to increase to \n10.5% in 2005 \n(cid:131) Upgrade of credit rating to B+  (cid:131) Sovereign rating at B in 2003  (cid:131) Standard & Poor\u2019s raised \nor equivalent  sovereign rating from B to B+ \nImproved Investment Climate \n(cid:131) Increase in share of  (cid:131) Share of investment to GDP at  (cid:131) Share of investment to GDP rose \ninvestment to GDP by 3\u20135%  18.9% in 2003  by 2% in 2004; projected to rise \nby 1.7% in 2005 \n(cid:131) Reduce the start-up time for  (cid:131) Start-up time for new business \n(cid:131) Start-up time for new business \nnew businesses from 151 to  151 days \n80 days. \n30 days \n                                                 \n31  ADB\u2019s support has been sought for improving public service delivery in the social sectors through a new program \naimed at poverty reduction and MDG acceleration, proposed for 2006.

Important Features \n \n84.  The DPSP has a number of distinct and innovative features. First, Indonesia with its \nstrong ownership has managed to coordinate all principal development partners to develop a \nconsistent and well-sequenced policy framework that prepares for macroeconomic and cross-\ncutting  structural  reforms  over  the  medium  term.  The  package  subscribes  to  the  Paris \nharmonization  development  agenda.  This  has  been  achieved  by  aligning  the  development \npartners\u2019 strategies and approaches to the Government\u2019s development strategy for 2004\u20132009, \nwhich takes into account Indonesia\u2019s emerging status as a middle-income country. This has \n ", "26   \ninvolved the World Bank and ADB aligning and harmonizing their respective strategies and \nmodalities. \n  \n85.  Second, the macroeconomic and cross-cutting policy framework is well coordinated with \nthe sector reform packages that broaden and deepen the DPSP. Examples of the sector reform \nprograms  are  the  ongoing  Local  Governance  and  Finance  Program  and  the  proposed \nInfrastructure Reform and Poverty and MDG acceleration programs, currently under discussion. \nConcurrent momentum on policy dialogue on these helps ensure continuity and sustainability of \nreforms. \n \n86.  Third, the DPSP has helped establish an institutional mechanism to achieve better \ninterministerial and interagency coordination to ensure proper coordination and implementation \nof reforms. An example of this is strengthening of institutional coordination between BAPPENAS \nand MOF to simplify and improve coordination of implementation of the decentralization policy \nframework, as well as approval and implementation of development projects. In addition, the \nDPSP  has  helped  define  roles,  functions,  and  responsibilities  in  approval,  financing,  and \nmonitoring of infrastructure development projects. \n \n87.  Fourth, the DPSP emphasizes qualitative changes in processes and programs to ensure \neffective implementation rather than a mere focus on conditionalities that do not often yield any \nclear results on the ground. \n \n88.  These elements and approaches have many advantages. They have drawn on collective \nadvice and analytical work of all the partners. They have provided the Government with the \nopportunity to steer its development program and process, keeping in perspective challenges of \nexecutive branch implementation and political capacity. The high ownership has already helped \ndevelopment of the future direction of reform and adjustments in areas where it was warranted. \nTogether this has provided for sustainability of reforms, while reducing the transaction costs for \nall parties. \n  \nF.  Financing Plan \n \n89.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the DPSP. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options \nthat may be exercised in accordance with the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and \nADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft program \nloan agreement. The Government has made its own independent decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given an undertaking that this choice was not \nmade on the basis of any advice from ADB. \n \n90.  The ADB funds support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter and policy \nmatrix (Appendix 2). The loan size was determined by the strengths of the policy package, its \ndevelopment impact, and the importance of the sectors covered.  \n \n91.  Delays in development spending in 2005, due to changes in budgetary procedures, and \nthe reduction in fuel subsidies in March and October 2005, will provide fiscal space for greater \ndevelopment expenditures in 2006. However, the Government\u2019s gross financing needs remain  \nhigh as it must budget for (i) increases in public expenditure for poverty reduction programs, \nutilizing  the  momentum  generated  by  the  fuel  subsidy  reduction;  (ii)  larger  external  debt \nrepayment ($6.5 billion in 2006 as against $4.1 billion in 2005); and (iii) increased domestic debt \namortization from Rp20 trillion to Rp30 trillion. The Paris Club debt rescheduling reduced the \n ", "    27 \nGovernment\u2019s net financing needs to about $2.5 billion in 2005. While the budget deficit and net \nfinancing needs will be lower in 2006, at 0.7% of GDP and $2.3 billion, respectively (from 0.9% \nand $2.5 billion, respectively, in 2005), amortization needs will be higher due to the end of Paris \nClub rescheduling arrangements. The financing needs will be met by raising domestic bond \nissues, sovereign bond issuance, and borrowings from multilateral development banks.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n92.  MOF will be the Executing Agency. Implementation of the DPSP actions is coordinated \nwith  a  number  of  other  ministries  and  agencies,  including  BAPPENAS,  Ministry  of  Trade, \nMinistry of Cooperatives and SMEs, and Bank Indonesia.  \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n93.  The DPSP period is from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2006. All actions included in the \nPolicy Matrix have been implemented during the course of 2005. The Government and ADB will \nprepare a program completion report by June 2006. The DPSP fits within the overall reform \nagenda supported under the DPLs, which covers 2003\u20132007.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n94.  The  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding the items specified in the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 9) and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, the \nproceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. \nNo supporting import documentation will be required, if during each year that loan proceeds are \nexpected to be disbursed the value of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. Disbursements will \nbe made under the simplified procedures for program loans. In accordance with the simplified \ndisbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans, all goods and services \nproduced and originating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to \neconomy and efficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard public procedures and \nnormal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the \ninternational commodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to \nthe trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n95.  The  reform  needs  supported  under  the  DPSP  will  be  met  through  local  currency \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the DPSP loan. The provision of DPSP will \nenable  the  Government  to  reorient  its  public  expenditures  towards  high  priority  poverty \nreduction needs. \n \n96.  The Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \nand  overall  public  financial  management,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the \nGovernment Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project and from ADB through \nthe State Audit Reform Sector Development Program. Reforms supported under both these \n ", "28   \nprograms have led to initial progress in strengthening public financial management. ADB and \nWorld Bank have jointly undertaken the Country Financial Accountability Assessment in 2001-\n02,32  which  has  been  periodically  updated.  Appendix  8  presents  the  fiduciary  assessment \nundertaken for DPSP/DPL-2, which also has an update on the Country Financial Accountability \nAssessment. \n \n4.  Anticorruption \n \n97.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment, and all relevant ADB guidelines, including the Guidelines for Procurement under \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  Loans,  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and its Borrowers, and the Loan Regulations, were specifically brought to \nthe notice of the Government. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n98.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Program Review \n \n99.  MOF,  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs,  and  BAPPENAS,  will  be \ncontinuously monitoring the implementation of the DPSP and its impact, in line with the overall \nprogram framework and outcome indicators agreed upon with the Government, and submit to \nADB quarterly reports until the completion of the DPSP. The outcomes of the present phase of \nthe DPSP/DPL-2 and the overall progress achieved will be assessed by the Government and \nthe development partners by June 2006. The forward looking phase of the DPSP  will be \nformulated in 2006 subject to satisfactory progress, and based on additional analytical and \neconomic and sector work being supported by ADB and other development partners. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n100.  The key benefits expected from the DPSP are \n \n(i)  progress  in  meeting  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of  (a) \nmacroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, (b) improved investment climate, \nand (c) anticorruption and improved governance; \n(ii)  consolidation  of  recent  macroeconomic  and  policy  reforms  leading  to  the \nformulation of a credible medium-term public expenditure framework; \n(iii)  sustained engagement by ADB in policy dialogue with the Government on the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional  reform  agenda;  the  DPSP  will  provide  for  policy  continuity  and \nconsistency in areas where ADB has been actively involved;  \n(iv)  facilitation,  through  cross-cutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or planning support; and \n                                                 \n32 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Supporting Country Financial Accountability. \nManila. \n ", "    29 \n(v)  aid harmonization and parallel financing by the key development partners (ADB, \nWorld Bank, and Government of Japan) around a common policy framework and \ndialogue,  and  the  resulting  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy \nimplementation and macroeconomic management. \n \n101.  Institutional.  The  DPSP  will  contribute  to  significant  institutional  development.  The \npublic expenditure reorientation program being adopted following the reduction in fuel subsidies \nwill enhance national and local government capacity in public service delivery. In the financial \nsector, the Government\u2019s support for LPS will improve public confidence in the banking system. \nThe formulation of a sound FSN will help institutionalize coordination arrangements between the \nGovernment and Bank Indonesia in the resolution of problem banks. In the infrastructure sector, \nthe DPSP will help establish KKPPI to enable it to effectively coordinate infrastructure policy \ndevelopment.  \n \n102.  Social. The DPSP\u2019s main contribution is in reducing wasteful spending, and supporting \nGovernment measures to effectively align its resources with its medium-term objectives of \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies,  particularly  for \nkerosene, has a negative impact on the welfare of the poor. The Government\u2019s compensation \nprogram aims to mitigate this impact by providing direct cash transfers, followed by a well-\nrounded  medium-term  development  program.  Appendix  10  presents  a  summary  poverty \nreduction and social impact mitigation strategy. \n \n103.  Economic.  The  nature  of  the  DPSP  does  not  allow  for  quantitative  financial  and \neconomic analysis. However, significant general economic benefits will accrue to the entire \nIndonesian population from the policy initiatives under the three core areas of the DPSP. \n \n104.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. The DPSP will cause no direct \nor indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues affecting indigenous peoples. \nBased on desk review, the measures supported under the DPSP are unlikely to have any \nadverse environmental impacts. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n105.  The DPSP is subject to the following risks: \n \n(i)  Economic volatility could worsen if the Government does not sustain the reform \nmomentum  to  follow  up  on  the  recent  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies  (including \nmaintaining appropriate interest rates and investment climate reforms). This risk \nis mitigated by the clear policy stance taken thus far by the Government and \nBank Indonesia. Following the recent currency market volatility, the need for \nrapid  policy  adjustment  on  the  domestic  front  in  line  with  key  global \ndevelopments is clearly recognized.  \n(ii)  Rising interest rates may trigger financial stress in debt markets with contagion \neffects on banks and mutual funds. In turn, this may also affect growth prospects. \nThe Government remains committed to closely monitoring the economic impact \nof the reforms adopted under the DPSP, with support from ADB and the other \ndevelopment partners. \n(iii)  Social tensions may increase. While the reduction in fuel subsidies announced \non 1 October 2005 have thus far not led to any major protests, the success of the \nongoing  unconditional  cash  transfers  program  is  vital  in  containing  public \ndisenchantment. This risk is mitigated by the Government\u2019s focus on ongoing \nevaluation of this program, with support from ADB and the World Bank. The \n ", "30   \nGovernment  also  aims  to  formulate  a  broad-based  public  expenditure \nreorientation program, an area where ADB is actively involved. \n(iv)  The external environment is deteriorating as persistently high oil-prices result in a \nslowdown  in  world  economic  growth  and  trade,  and  create  unfavorable \nconditions  in  world  financial  markets.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  package \nannounced on 1 October provides for attracting investments in the oil and gas \nsector, which in turn will help Indonesia effectively manage its natural resources \nand reap the benefits of any windfall gains. \n(v)  Amending the tax laws is likely to be a long drawn out process and the final \nscope  of  the  laws  is  unclear,  given  the  competing  and  conflicting  interests \nbetween the needs for greater revenues, and the demands from the private \nsector for incentives and sound governance in tax administration. The current \nadministrative  procedures  of  the  current  tax  system  have  frequently  raised \nserious  concerns  among  businesses.  Although  progress  has  been  made  in \nmodernizing tax offices, the tax system needs to be strengthened, given the \nadministrative  weaknesses,  perception  of  excessive  authority  given  to  tax \nofficials, and the resulting excessive compliance costs. The Government remains \ncommitted to gradually addressing these constraints.  \n(vi)  Heightened security alerts stemming from sectarian and regional conflicts and \nterrorism  could  slow  foreign  direct  investment  and  set  back  the  recovering \ntourism industry. The Government and law enforcement authorities have taken a \nrange of measures aimed at rebuilding public and investor confidence.  \n  \nV.  ASSURANCES \n106.  In  addition  to  the  standards  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the development needs as outlined \nunder the DPSP implementation arrangements. \n \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the DPSP loan agreement, as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of the DPSP and subsequently. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n107.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve a single-tranche program loan of $200,000,000 to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the Development Policy Support Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based \nlending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n   President \n \n28 November 2005 \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  31 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       Assumption \nThe Medium-Term  By 2009, RPJM goals  Central Bureau of Statistics  \u2022  Macroeconomic and \nDevelopment Plan  attained:   data  political stability \n(RPJM) of the present  (i)  real gross domestic     \nGovernment is fully  product (GDP)  Household expenditure and  Risks \nimplemented.  growth at 7%  other relevant impact  \u2022  Lack of effective \n(ii)  poverty halved to  assessment surveys  coordination between \n8.2% from 16.6% in    national government \n2004    ministries \n(iii) unemployment    \u2022  Slow pace of reforms  \nreduced to 5.1%    \u2022  Public opposition to \nfrom 9.9% in 2004    reforms \n(iv) corruption reduced  Data from KPK \n(to be monitored   \nthrough corruption   \nperception surveys,   \nand cases handled   \nby the Corruption   \nEradication   \nCommission (KPK)   \n   \nTangible improvements  Data on Millennium \nin social indicators in  Development Goals (MDGs) \nareas benefiting from  from Central Bureau of \nthe post-fuel-subsidy  Statistics, line ministry \ncompensation program  surveys, and from other \n  development partners \nDevelopment spending   \nrevived from the current   \nlow levels of around 3%   \nof GDP to at least 6%   \nof GDP   \n   \nInvestments in  Data from the National \ninfrastructure  Committee for the Acceleration \nstimulated through  of Infrastructure Development \npublic-private   \npartnerships (PPP) -   \nspecifically, bidding   \ncompleted and   \nimplementation   \nunderway for a majority   \nof the 91 projects   \nannounced at the   \nIndonesia Infrastructure \nSummit in January \n2005 \nOutcome  Key fiscal and  Ministry of Finance (MOF)  Assumption \nGreater  investment indicators  reports  \u2022  Economy able to \nmacroeconomic  on a steady course of    withstand external or \nstability;

Despite a number \nof unforeseen difficulties we made significant progress on our reform agenda including the \ndifficult but critical decisions to reduce unsustainable subsidies by bringing domestic fuel prices \ninto closer alignment with international fuel prices. To cushion the blow of higher fuel prices on \nthe poor we have instituted two major programs of assistance, a program earlier in the year \nfocused on reducing costs of education and health care along with grants for rural infrastructure, \nand a new cash transfer program that is providing Rp.300,000 a quarter to 15.5 million families \nover the next year. We believe that these steps and improvements to the investment climate and \ngovernance have laid the foundation for sustained high quality growth.  In this letter we would \nlike to take the opportunity to highlight our policy agenda for the year ahead and beyond.  \nA year ago the Government had just come into office and our focus was, of necessity, on existing \npolicy initiatives and a transitional strategy from the previous administration\u2019s agenda. Now, \nhowever, the Government has developed and is implementing our own strategy through our \nMedium Term Development Plan (RPJM) for 2004-2009 and our Annual Work Plan (RKP) for \n2006.  In these plans our Government has set ourselves ambitious development goals, and it is \nthese Government plans and our commitment to achieve our Indonesian development goals that \nunderpin this year\u2019s Letter of Development Policy.  \nOur   partnership  with  your  institutions  on  this year\u2019s  Development  Policy  Loan (DPL)  was \nbuilt  on   your   active   support  for   the   reform   agenda  we  laid  out  last   year  and   it   has  \n \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nbeen a successful partnership. We very much welcomed your commitment at the Consultative \nGroup for Indonesia (CGI) meeting January 2005 of an additional DPL program Loan in FY2005 \nin line with sufficient Government progress on the indicative reform agenda agreed to last year \nwith the World Bank, JBIC and the ADB on various policy and sector reforms. We believe that \nwe have met virtually all policy actions in the World Bank High Case and DPL or they will be \ncomplete  shortly,  and  reforms  in  a  number  of  areas  have  far  exceeded  expectations.  The \nGovernment of Indonesia very much appreciates the commitment from your institutions to work \nwith us on medium term reforms as reliable development financing partners. Our financing needs \nremain large in 2005 and beyond and it is important for financing and the continuity of reforms \nthat both parties commit to an annual loan based on an accurate but flexible assessment of \nprogress on a mutually agreed reform agenda. This letter is in support of our request that the \nWorld Bank approve a US$400 million and the Asian Development Bank a US$200 million \nprogram loan to disburse in FY2005. \nWe are now concluding the assessment of progress on the three reform pillars laid out in last \nyear\u2019s  letter:  supporting  macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness;  improving  the \ninvestment climate; and improving public financial management and governance.  Looking to \nthe future, we propose to continue these priorities as they are essential to sustained growth and \npoverty reduction. However we would like to increase the emphasis on poverty reduction and \nmake this explicit by adding a fourth pillar that increases the focus on social development and \npro-poor spending. Further, we envision that this would be the beginning of a transition of our \nprogram  with  you  toward  achieving  Indonesia\u2019s  MDG  linked  goals  and  in  particular  our \nmedium-term commitments in the RPJM. \nA.  Macroeconomic Outlook \n \nThis year has been a good one for growth in Indonesia. In the first half of 2005 GDP growth \npicked up dramatically to grow 5.9 percent, with investment growing an even more robust 13.6 \npercent. Investment has now clearly taken over from private consumption (at 3.3 percent in the \nfirst half) as the leading driver of our growth process.  This growth in investment has been \ncomplimented by high growth in exports and capital imports setting the stage for continued \ngrowth in the 6 percent range this year and next. \n \nDespite the improving growth outlook, there have been macroeconomic disturbances this year in \nfinancial  markets,  especially  late  August  and  early  September  when  the  exchange  rate \ndepreciated rapidly and interest rates rose abruptly. Inflation has also increased due, in part, to \nthe depreciation in the exchange rate, but in larger part, to the increases in fuel prices including \nthe 29 percent increase in March, the increases in industrial fuel prices starting in July and the \nlarge increase in October. Finally when international oil prices rose to US$70 a barrel and our \nsubsidies grew dramatically concerns about the fiscal position also mounted. \n \nIn  response  to  rising uncertainties about both the monetary and fiscal position the Central Bank \nand  the Government adopted a multi-part strategy announced by the President  the 31th of \nAugust  2005.  The  Central  Bank  increased  the  interest  rate  on  the  key  one-month  Central \nbank  instrument  by  125  basis  points  in  early  September,  followed  by  another  100 \n ", "  Appendix 2  37 \n \n \nbasis points in early October and indicated its readiness to increase again if needed. For its part \nthe government announced that it would substantially reduce fuel subsidies on October 1st after \nfirst putting into place a cash compensation program to mitigate the impact on the poorest \nfamilies and an incentive package for workers and businesses. As noted, in early October the \nGovernment rolled out a cash compensation program to provide Rp.300,000 per household per \nquarter  to  15.5  million  households.  With  the  cash  transfer  in  process  on  October  3rd  the \ngovernment raised fuel prices on the remaining subsidized kerosene, gasoline and automotive \ndiesel  prices.  The  incentive  package  included:  measures  for  workers  such  as  a  substantial \nincrease in the taxable income threshold; for businesses a reduction in tariffs on capital goods, \nthe elimination of the VAT on agriculture products and a reduction in the Transport Handling \nCharge (THC); specifically for the transportation industry tariffs for spare parts were reduced or \neliminated,  a  large  number  of  local  government  regulations  that  raise  transport  costs  were \nabolished and weigh stations reduced. With this fuel price increase in place prices of gasoline \nand diesel are now above 70 percent of world prices. While kerosene remains heavily subsidized \nit is now 35 percent of the world price. With these adjustments in place we believe that we are on \ntrack to achieve a budget deficit target of 0.7 percent by the end of the year. \n \nThe Market has responded favorably to these moves with the exchange rate strengthening and \nthe  stock  market  rising  since  the  beginning  of  September.  However,  we  now  anticipate  a \nsignificant increase in inflation as higher fuel prices pass through the economy and inflation is \nestimated to reach at least 12 percent at its peak before falling back to  around 8 percent by the \nend of 2006. We also anticipate that higher interest rates and the adjustment to higher fuel prices \nmay slow economic growth in the 4th quarter and early next year. However, this impact will be \ndampened as spending on subsidies is shifted to infrastructure and social spending. There should \nbe an additional bonus as policy uncertainty is reduced and investment sentiment recovers. Given \nthese changes we now estimate that growth in 2005 will be 5.8 percent before recovering to the \n6.2 percent range by the end of 2006 and to the 7 percent range in the medium term as the \neconomy completes its adjustment. \n \nB.  Other Issues \n \nBefore  turning  explicitly  to  the  reform  agendas  in  the  areas  of  macroeconomic  stability, \nthe  investment  climate  and  public  financial  management  we  would  like  to  touch  on  a few \nother  issues  of  critical  importance  to  Indonesian  development.   As  you  are  aware  last  \nDecember\u2019s  tragedy  in  Aceh  and  Nias  put  the  government  under  a great deal of extra  \npressure, and  has  almost  certainly slowed  progress  on  reform. However, even more critically \nwhile reconstruction is now picking up we are far from satisfied with the progress achieved to \nrebuild  people  lives  and  livelihoods.  We    have    established    a    ministerial    level  Aceh  \nReconstruction  Agency,  a  first  for  Indonesia, and  we  expect   that it  will  not  only speed up  \ndevelopment, but  mprove the quality of outcomes and set new standards for governance.  The \npeace  settlement  with  GAM  has  added to  confidence  that  this  could  be  a turning point for \nthe  province.  We  very  much  appreciate  the  role  your\n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n \n \ninstitutions have  played  and we remain mindful of the need to improve budget and coordination \nprocesses to deliver results on the ground. \n \nAs the President noted in his address to the International Parliamentarian Conference in Helsinki, \n2005 has brought a new threat more dangerous than a Tsunami to Indonesia. As you are aware \nthe Avian Influenza has already killed a number of our citizens as part of a world wide outbreak \nand infections continue to be detected in birds across the country. The government proposes to \naddress this emerging crisis as part of our commitment to social welfare and to mitigate the \ncatastrophic  risk  that  an  avian  influenza  pandemic  would  represent.  In  particular,  we  are \ndeveloping and funding an AI control strategy and action plan, including both human and animal \nhealth aspects.   \n \nThe fight against corruption is one of the top priorities in our agenda. Strong backing has been \nprovided for the newly established Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK) and specialized Anti-\nCorruption Court.  These efforts are yielding promising results. Convictions in several high \nprofile graft cases have been handed down. Yet, much remains to be done in terms of reducing \nthe opportunities for corruption at the systemic and institutional level and we intend to continue \nto push ahead with this agenda. \n \nIn  this  context,  civil  service  reforms  remain  an  important  reform  issue.  We  realize  that \nadministrative  capacity  and  incentives  in  the  government  bureaucracy  exert  a  drag  on \nimplementation in policy areas. We strongly believe that the civil service reform agenda should \nbe reinvigorated in order to improve service delivery, enable a more positive investment climate \nand reduce corruption. To provide this, we are planning to establish an empowered high-level \nModernization Team to strategize and manage the reform process. The Team would be mandated \nand required to develop a comprehensive road map and strategy for civil service reform, which \nwould include specific measures to clarify the organization of civil service management; move \nthe public administration toward a performance orientation and introduce merit-based practices \nto the civil service; control the fiscal weight of the civil service wage bill; strengthen regional \nand local government administrative capacity and accountability and introduce strong elements \nof competency- and skills-based training. \n \nC.  Indicative forward-looking program of the Government \n \nOur Medium term plan focuses on 3 broad objectives: a Safe and Peaceful Indonesia; a Just and \nDemocratic Indonesia; and a prosperous Indonesia. These in limited to 7 priorities in the 2006 \nwork plan: \n1)  Reduction in poverty and disparity, \n2)  Increased employment opportunities (including through increased investment and \nexports), \n3)  Revitalized agriculture and rural development, \n4)  Improved access to and quality of education and health services, \n5)  The eradication of corruption; bureaucratic reform; and law enforcement, \n6)  A stronger defense; law and order; and improved conflict resolution, and \n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \n7)  Rehabilitating and reconstructing Aceh and Nias. \n \n \nTo provide focus and continuity this Letter of Development Policy builds on Poverty Reduction \n(Priority 1), Employment Generation (Priority 2), Access to Heath and Education (Priority 4) and \nGovernance  (Priority  5).  For  example,  our  Annual  Action  Plan  observes  that  a  sustained \nreduction in poverty and reduced inequality depends fundamentally on sound macroeconomic \nfoundations:  especially  low  inflation  and  prudent  fiscal  policy  as  high  inflation  has  a \ndisproportionate impact on poverty and high debt levels and an uncertain fiscal stance affect \ninterest and exchange rate expectations raising the cost of funds and risking exchange rate \nturbulence. An improved investment climate designed to create jobs and economic momentum is \nat the heart of the agenda for Priority 2 and improved Public Financial Management is central to \nvirtually all areas of government operations. As noted in this Letter of Development Policy we \nare adding an emphasis on reducing poverty and income uncertainty (again Priority 1) and \nimproved education and health service (Priority 4). \n \nMacroeconomic stability  \n \nMacroeconomic stability continues to underlie our basic strategy and we intend to focus on \ncontrolling inflation, the reallocation of untargeted subsidies, fiscal consolidation, a prudent sub-\nnational borrowing framework, a better institutional design to assess and set fiscal policy and \nimproved stability and functioning of the financial sector. \n  \nInflation has been on the rise this year due, in part to the run up in the exchange rate and, in part, \nto fuel price increases. With the latest increase in fuel prices inflation will rise further and now \nrepresents  a  potential  challenge  to  macroeconomic  stability  and  poverty  reduction.  Bank \nIndonesia, in cooperation with the Government, will continue to focus monetary policy on \nbringing inflation back to the 8 percent range by the end of 2006 in anticipation of a return to an \ninflation targeting strategy designed to bring Indonesia into line with regional averages in the \nmedium term. To do this we will work together with the Central Bank to convey a clear message \ndesigned to dampen inflation expectations and prevent a pass-through into additional uncertainty \nand higher interest rates.  \n \nThe Government will continue to focus on fiscal consolidation. With the increase in fuel prices \non October 3, the Government\u2019s fiscal outlook is much improved. We are now confident that we \ncan achieve our budget deficit targets for 2005 and 2006 and additional funds from reduced \nsubsidies can be reallocated to increased social spending and infrastructure. Specifically in next \nyear\u2019s budget in addition to continuing the cash transfers we are budgeting substantial increases \nfor the social sectors (schools, health clinics), and small scale and rural infrastructure (especially \nroads). In fact the sum of these programs will reach 60 percent of the funds reallocated from the \nsubsidy reduction. Nevertheless we remain mindful that the recent run-up in world oil prices and \nfixed domestic prices jeopardized our fiscal position, economic efficiency and needed energy \ndiversification  (especially  toward  increased  use  of  coal  and  gas).  Thus,  the  government \nregulation (Perpres 55/2005) that raised fuel prices on October 3, also signals the government\u2019s \nintent to continue to reallocate untargeted subsidies and to a continuing adjustment of domestic \nprices to market ones.  \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \n \nDespite substantial progress in bringing down the government debt to GDP ratio our fiscal \nsituation remains fragile as we note from the recent jump in government borrowing rates. Our \ndebt to GDP ratio is now around 50 percent of GDP down from 54 percent of GDP at the end of \n2004. We propose to continue this trend reduction and our goal is a ratio of government debt to \nGDP of 30-35 percent debt by 2009. To achieve this, the Government will propose to Parliament \na deficit for 2006 at 0.7 percent of GDP. Our strategy to bring inflation into line with regional \naverages  and  bring  down  our  debt  to  GDP  ratio  should  dramatically  lower  government \nborrowing rates, with the added benefit of lowering interest rates for the private sector crowding \nin investment and extending maturities, with particular impact on the quality of growth and the \nability to fund infrastructure.  \n \nDespite relatively low deficits, gross financing needs remain large and the government needs an \neffective borrowing and debt management strategy. And in September the Finance Ministry and \nthe Planning Ministry presented such a strategy to Parliament. In particular the debt management \nstrategy (No. 447/KMK.06/2005) presented focuses on various risks (interest, exchange rate, \nmaturity, etc.) and the need for balance and diversification. In sum, while market conditions will \ndictate strategy at any given moment, we propose to gradually increase the share of government \ndebt denominated in rupiah. We will also attempt to extend the average maturity and reduce the \nshare of debt at variable rate. Over the next year we will improve our capability to monitor, \nreport and assess our debt position. This will be done by publishing (and placing on our website) \nan integrated quarterly (domestic and foreign) debt report. The Ministry of Finance will also \ncontinue to improve its capacity to quantitatively assess the risks indicated above. Finally, the \nGovernment  proposes  to  undertake  a  program  to  assess  and  catalogue  various  contingent \nliabilities.  As  part  of  next  year\u2019s  program  we  will  extend  and  update  projections  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s contingent liabilities including to State Owned Enterprises, and public pension \nfunds.  \nUnder Law 33/2004 regional governments are empowered to borrow from capital markets (to \ndevelop  local  infrastructure).  International  experience  has  demonstrated  the  significant \nmacroeconomic  risks  from  imprudent  sub-national  borrowing.  Thus  the  Government  is \ncommitted to improving the regulatory framework for sub-national government bond issuance \nand developing remedies and work out procedures in case of default. While we will have shortly \ncompleted the government regulations and ministerial decrees to operationalize on-lending our \nown  funds  and  foreign  loans  to  regional  governments,  elements  of  this  agenda  remain \nincomplete. In particular we are finishing a Finance ministry decree that operationalizes on-\ngranting to regional governments and revisiting the procedures at the Planning Ministry that \ndetermine  the  submission  and  appraisal  process  for  projects  to  be  financed/funded  by  on-\nlending/on-granting (The Blue Book) as well as loan/grant disbursement, administration and \nmonitoring/evaluation  procedures.    To  improve  both  regional  government  access  to  capital \nmarkets and our own on-lending/on-granting procedures we propose to set up a clearing house of \ninformation  on  regional  government  arrears  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  share  this \ninformation, with due consideration to confidentiality, within the Ministry of Finance, and to \nBappenas and the Ministry of Home Affairs.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  41 \n \n \nAs we indicated last year, the Government remains committed to longer-term fiscal sustainability \nand macroeconomic stability by broadening the base and improving the efficiency of non-oil \nrevenue sources (especially taxes, but also including excises and other revenues). To continue \nour commitment to improving the investment climate this needs to be done while minimizing the \nburden  on  the  business  community  and  private  citizens.  The  main  effort  to  improve  tax \ncollections and the tax environment will continue to involve the expansion of the modern tax \noffice and the amendments to the tax laws now in Parliament. However, this year we are also \ncommitting to improving the foundation for making fiscal and especially tax policy and tariff \nsetting at the Ministry of Finance. A principle of the reorganization of the Ministry was the \nseparation of analysis and implementation. A next step here involves developing a source of tax \npolicy capacity and advice outside the Tax Department capable of finding and addressing the \nbalance between tax payers rights and the needs of the State. Thus, in 2006, the Ministry of \nFinance proposes to improve its capability to effectively assess tax and tariff policies, among \nother policy areas, by establishing a Fiscal Policy Office with a tax unit capable of systematic tax \npolicy analysis. This will be done by creating an institutional design, developing terms of \nreference and a staffing plan for an office operational in 2007.  Other efforts include improving \nthe usefulness and dissemination of tax data to allow improved tax forecasting and analysis units \n(including  by  the  proposed  Fiscal  Policy  Office,  and  revised  operating  and  administrative \nprocedures for Team Tariff.  \n \nImproving our financial system is also a key priority to maintain macroeconomic stability. An \nincrease in inflation and interest rates \u2013 due to the recent increase in fuel prices - will be \naccompanied by rising levels of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) and stress on Banks and Non-\nBank Financial Institutions. In 2005, Bank Indonesia has introduced new measures to improve \nrisk management, strengthen minimum capital requirements and new requirements on consumer \nprotection. While we believe the Banking system to be in relatively good health and able to deal \nwith  this  threat,  we  are  committed  to  maintaining  continued  vigilance  in  regulation  and \nsupervision.  In 2006, we intend to continue to phase out the blanket guarantee for the banking \nsystem that began this year with the creation and endowment of a Deposit Insurance Agency and \nthe elimination of the guarantee on interbank loans. By September of next year, deposits up to a \nmaximum of Rp. 1 billion will be covered \u2013 on the way to the ultimate target of Rp. 100 million \nof coverage by March 2007. We will strengthen the framework for resolution of problem banks \nby ensuring that the roles of Bank Indonesia, Ministry of Finance, and LPS to act in such \nsituations are clear and that sound institutional arrangements are in place.  We propose to create \na Financial Sector Stability Forum that will provide key technical inputs into the decision making \nof Coordination Committee that will oversee the resolution of problem banks. Overall, during \n2006, we plan to have a well established financial sector safety net in place.  \n \nWe   are  aware  that Indonesia needs to diversify its financial sector from its over-reliance on the \nbanking  sector.  Indonesia  also  needs  to  develop  sources  of  long-term  domestic  capital  in \norder  to  finance  its  many  development  needs \u2013 including infrastructure. In 2006, we  propose \nto    take  several  steps  to  strengthen  non-bank  financial  institutions  that  are  key \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \n \n \nsources for such long-term resources.  Building on the work undertaken in the area of capital \nmarkets, we will develop and issue a formal strategy to guide the development of the NBFIs \nmarket in the medium-term. Prudential regulations governing the operation of finance companies \nwill be issued as a Ministerial decree. In the capital markets area, we propose to issue prudential \nregulations for municipal bonds - thereby enabling the development of this market, as well as \nregulations governing the operation of secondary markets for government debt. We will also take \nsteps to strengthen and further develop the mutual fund industry \u2013 especially after the recent \nstress experienced by this industry. Institutionally, we plan to complete the merger between \nBAPEPAM and DGFI \u2013 enabling their smooth operation.    We will also be focusing our \nattention on significantly upgrading the capacity of the merged entity.  \n  \nImproving the investment climate \n \nHowever, macroeconomic stability will not, by itself deliver the jobs, growth and economic \ndynamism that we want and we remain fully committed to attracting broad based investment \n(foreign and domestic) and adding infrastructure, in cooperation with the private sector to sustain \nand accelerate growth. There has been progress in a number of areas that should improve the \ninvestment climate and we are pleased to indicate that new laws are at or approaching Parliament \nin a number of areas. Nevertheless, more is needed to meet investor concerns. In particular we \nintend to push reforms in the areas of business start-up, taxes and customs, trade restrictions and \ninfrastructure in the year ahead. \n \nTo improve the business climate the government intends to follow up on its pledge to reduce the \ntime to register a firm from the oft cited 151 days in 2005 to 30 days or less. The new investment \nlaw will only be considered by Parliament in 2006, but there are a number of measures to reduce \nthe time to start a business and reduce costs that would complement the new law and can be \nundertaken independently. Thus we intend to move ahead on reducing the time to register and \nlegalize a company by streamlining business registration, company formation and licensing. For \nexample, and in addition, the Ministry of Trade has indicated that they are reviewing 77 licenses \nwith the goal of eliminating unnecessary ones, while simplifying and combining others. This \neffort will be extended to other ministries. The DG of Tax will continue to improve service to the \nbusiness community by speeding up refunds, simplifying tax preparation and submission and \nredressing  administration  concerns  this  is  in  addition  to  or  as  part  of  our  main  focus  on \nexpanding the modern tax offices. In the area of improve Customs we intend to continue to \nreduce time to clear customs, and increase the number of compliant importers with access to the \nGreen line.   \n \nIn  response  to  concerns  about  regional  obstacles  to  investment,  in  2005,  the  Government \ncompleted  and  submitted  to  Parliament  a  new  law  on  regional  taxation   that  establishes a   \nstrict  positive list  for  allowable  regional   taxes  and charges.   Next  year  we  propose   to \nfollow-up  the  implementation  of  this law  by enacting and  implementing  government \nregulations   designed  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  positive  list,   while  assessing   the \nadequacy   of   the   current   list   in   line   with   the   new   government   regulation   on service \n ", "  Appendix 2  43 \n \n \nassignments.  An area of weakness has been the delivery of basic public services in our cities, \nwhich not only jeopardizes our MDG goals but also affects the investment climate through \nhigher costs and a degraded environment. Thus a priority this year is to clarify the legal status of \nregional public enterprises (water companies, for example) including their fiscal and financial \nrelationships with regional governments by drafting a new law on Regional Public Enterprises \n(BUMD). With their status clarified these critical enterprises will be able to increase investments \nand improve service delivery outcomes across Indonesia.  \n \nThe Government will continue to address the issue of regional obstacles and trade policy more \nbroadly through an amended Trade Law designed to improve the framework for for domestic and \ninternational trade through among other things submission to Parliament of a trade bill that \nimproves the efficiency of domestic and international trade, through submission to the President \nof a draft trade bill to ensure the free movement of goods within the country and a competitive \ntrade regime.  \n \nAs  part  of  the  measures  to  strengthen  Indonesia's  infrastructure  program  and  enhance  its \ninternational credibility among investors and financiers, the Government proposes to establish a \ncross-sectoral Public Private Partnership (PPP) and Risk Management Framework. These are \nneeded  to  deepen  infrastructure  coordination  and  develop  clear  procedures  for  ensuring \nappropriate risk sharing. To achieve this we propose to establish a Risk Management Unit within \nthe Ministry of Finance with adequate resources and funding.  We will also provide a budget \nallocation for public budget support to PPP transactions in infrastructure including both cash \n(i.e., subsidies), and non-cash (i.e., guarantees and other forms of contingent liabilities), if any. \nThis will be part of our normal budget submission.  To make our PPP framework operational we \nwill issue the required regulations needed to complement Keppres 7 including a KKPPI Decree \ncreating a PPP Implementation Framework, and publication of policies and procedures for the \nprovision of government support to PPPs. Finally, we anticipate issuing the initial list of PPP \nprojects to be offered for bidding to the private sector under adequate international bidding \nstandards.  \n \nFiduciary reforms  \n \nIn  the  area  of  governance  and  fiduciary  reforms  we  propose  to  extend  the  reform  agenda \ncurrently underway. Areas of emphasis will include procurement, improving budget processes, \nextending the Treasury Single Account, and improving accounting standards. \n \nThe  President  has  taken  an  active  interest  in  Procurement  Policy;  emphasizing  its \nimportance  to  governance  issues  and  his  anti-corruption  agenda.  He  has  asked  us  to \nelevate   this   issue   by   creating  a  high   level   procurement   policy  body   that  reports \ndirectly   to  him.  This   effort will build on a   foundation created with Presidential   Regulation  \n80/2003  and  the   establishment   at   the   Planning   Agency   of   the  nucleus   of an   \noperational   Procurement  Policy Office. In line with Keppres 80/2003 Chapter 6, section 50a \nthe Government will establish and staff an independent National Procurement Policy Office.  \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \n \n \nWhile  we  put  in  place  this  national  level  office  we  will  also  be  pushing  ahead  with  the \ndevelopment and dissemination of e-procurement and standard bidding documents.  \n \nProblems with budget systems and disbursement became were a serious issue in 2005. The \ncombination of a late start to the budget year due to the change in government, new processes \n(including a new budget format) and the reorganization at the Ministry of Finance combined to \nslow disbursement. We believe that most of the problems have been solved and we do not \nanticipate a repeat of this year\u2019s problem in 2006. However, we also recognize that additional \nbudget reforms are needed. One difficulty has been the lack of clear information on the state of \nbudget disbursements at a sufficient level of detail. Thus we will produce a quarterly report on \nbudget spending by organizations and regular semi-annual reports according to economic and \nfunctional categories that we will be put in the public domain. However, another important task \nis to improve the quality of our budgeting process at entry; that is the design and development of \nprograms needed to make performance based budgeting and MTEF practicable. To do this we \npropose to create a task force combining elements of the Ministry of Finance and the Planning \nMinistry to review program structures, propose revisions and provide improved guidance and \ntraining to line ministries for the development of the 2008 budget (required by end 2006). \n \nWe also intend to extend the development of the new Treasury system and the development of a \nTreasury Single Account system. Over the next year this will involve extending the zero-balance \npilot now underway to most or all Treasury offices in the country. We will also begin to bring \nFinance accounts including the RDI/RDA and oil transitory accounts into the Governments BUN \naccount. We will also continue the process of account consolidation by establishing a system to \nbring  off-budget  accounts  from  outside  the  Ministry  of  Finance  into  the  Treasury  Single \nAccount. \n  \nTransparency and good governance can only be achieved when reporting systems are timely and \naccurate. Thus we propose to improve accounting standards in this year\u2019s letter. The Government \nproposes two priorities. The first priority builds on this year\u2019s first un-audited consolidated \nfinancial statement issued in May 2005 (for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004) by \nimproving the quality and completeness of information on financial assets and liabilities, and \nmost importantly focusing on reconciling financial transactions by different units within the \nMinistry of Finance and between the Ministry of Finance and Line Ministries. The second \npriority is to improve sub-national fiscal reporting standards by rationalizing existing reporting \nsystems and increasing the timeliness of reports (by amending PP 105). \n \nSocial Development and Pro-Poor Spending \n \nWith  this  year\u2019s  letter  of  Development  Policy  we  are  introducing  a  new  focus  on   social \ndevelopment  and  pro-poor  spending.  This   commitment   is   based   on   the   Government\u2019s \ngoal  of  achieving   the   Millennium   Development    Goals   by 2015   and  our  own   medium-\nterm  development   goals   set   fort   in   the   RPJM by 2009. This year we propose to continue \nthe  earlier  focus  on   macroeconomic stability, the investment  climate,   and   public   financial  \n ", "  Appendix 2  45 \n ", " \nTable A2.1: Development Policy Support Program \nPolicy Matrix  4\n6\n   \nPolicy Actions  Summary of Achievements \nA\np\n1.

Make progress in reducing subsidies to the non- In 2005, the Government has made bold and commendable progress to reduce fuel  nd\npoor.  subsidies. In March, fuel prices were increased by 29% on average. Subsequently, the  ix 2\nGovernment increased fuel prices by a further 126.6% on average on 1 October,    \nbringing  domestic  fuel  prices  closer  to  international  prices.  It  also  announced  an \nautomatic price adjustment mechanism, under which the ministries concerned have \nbeen tasked with decisions on price adjustments, thus effectively depoliticizing the \nprocess.   \n1.2. Reorient public expenditures to poverty reduction.  The Government has initiated the reorientation of the potential savings from fuel subsidy \nreduction to high priority poverty reduction programs. The Budget for 2005 has allocated \n$1.8 billion for a comprehensive pro-poor compensation program aimed at enhancing \neducation, health, and rural infrastructure investments. Development expenditures have \nbeen scaled up by 1.3% of GDP ($3 billion) in the 2006 budget. The Government has \nindicated its commitment to further raise public expenditures for social and poverty \nprograms, to be financed by potential fuel savings and tightening of other expenditures \nand programs that are not performing well. \n1.3. Make tax revenue administration more efficient by  All tax offices in Jakarta were modernized by upgrading hardware and software. In \nexpanding modern tax offices.  addition, the President has submitted to the Parliament a comprehensive tax reform \npackage, comprising legal, regulatory, and procedural amendments to tax laws. The \namendments provide a range of incentives to individual as well as corporate taxpayers \n \nThe Government has expanded the tax base by issuing taxpayer identification cards to \nabout 10 million individual/corporate taxpayers, up from about 3.5 million taxpayers at \nthe end of 2004. Due in part to these measures, non-oil tax revenues increased by 26% \nby the end of August 2005. \n1.4.  Develop  and  implement  a  debt  management  Public debt has been reduced from 91% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000 to \nstrategy.  52% in June 2005. Of this, outstanding domestic debt has declined from 47% to 25% of \nGDP, while external public debt has declined from 44% to 27% over the same period. \nThe Government has successfully re-profiled its debt, smoothening and lengthening the \nmaturity profile. The Government has also adopted a system of publishing consolidated \ndebt information in the public domain, with the latest quarterly data available for June. \n \nTo sustain the progress, the Government aims to reduce public debt to 30% of GDP by \n2010.

The adoption of the \nrevised decree and new procedures will simplify and facilitate regional development at \nthe decentralized levels in Indonesia. \n2. Improved Investment Climate \n2.1. Strengthen the legal and regulatory framework on  The Government has prepared a new investment law (intended to replace the 1967 \ninvestments, aimed at reducing transactions costs for  investment law), providing a modern and simpler legal framework, essentially moving \nbusiness.1 towards  a  registration-oriented  system  (as  opposed  to  the  earlier  approval-driven \nsystem). All interministerial consultations are complete, and agreement reached on the \nconceptual framework. The draft is being reviewed by the Ministry of Law and Human \nRights, pending submission to the President. Under the program, the Government has \nstrengthened the National Team for Increasing Exports and Investments through a \nPresidential decree. These national measures are complemented by efforts to reduce \nnuisance  taxes  and  regulations  at  the  local  government  level,  which  have  been \nsupported  under  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment Program, approved on 3 November 2005 by ADB. \n2.2.

Monetary policy has been tightened significantly and the government announced \nsharp cuts in domestic fuel subsidies, effective October 1, to address pressures on the budget and \nthe balance of payments associated with high international prices. Breaking a policy of gradual and \nmodest rate increases, BI raised its one-month policy rate by 125 basis points to 10 percent in late \nAugust/early September and by an additional 100 basis points in early October. The last hike came \nafter the sharp increases on October 1 in domestic fuel prices\u201488 percent on gasoline, 200 percent \non  kerosene,  and  185  percent  on  diesel.  The  fuel  price  increase  was  accompanied  by  a \ncompensation package, whereby 15\u00bd million families will receive about US$120 annually to help \noffset the impact of rising fuel costs on their income. Markets have reacted positively to the interest \nrate and domestic fuel price increases, and both the rupiah and the stock market have strengthened \nsince.  \n\u2022  The macroeconomic situation is weaker but the outlook for growth is still favorable. Real GDP \ngrew by 5.1 percent in 2004 and is envisaged to increase by 5\u20135\u00bd percent in 2005. This pace is \nsomewhat slower than the 6 percent growth registered earlier this year, reflecting the impact of the \nrecent financial market volatility on consumer and investment spending, as well as higher oil prices. \nInflation is expected to remain in the double digits in the near-term, following the big jump in October \nto 18 percent (year-on-year) that largely reflected the impact of domestic fuel price increases but also a \nmore general pickup in price pressures.  To contain underlying inflation, BI raised its policy interest \nrate by another 125 basis points on November 1, and stated its commitment to take further action, as \nneeded, so as to bring inflation back down to single digits by the end of 2006.   \n\u2022  Fiscal policy remains prudent and the revised 2005 budget deficit target of about one percent of \nGDP is achievable. The revised 2005 budget approved by parliament in September entailed a slight \nincrease in the deficit target by 0.1 percent of GDP to 0.9 percent of GDP (1.3 percent of GDP under \nIMF definitions). With fuel subsidy payments this year now expected to reach just over 3 percent of \nGDP, compared with over 4 percent estimated prior to the hike and given the slower-than-expected \npace of capital expenditures so far, the deficit target should be met. The 2006 revised budget, reflecting \nmore updated macroeconomic developments, including the cut in domestic fuel subsidies, was just \napproved by Parliament. The deficit target has been kept at 0.7 percent of GDP in line with the \nauthorities commitment of continued fiscal consolidation and a further reduction in the public debt \nburden. \n\u2022  The international reserve position is expected to recover again over the medium term. Gross \ninternational reserves, although adequate in terms of short-term debt at about 130 percent of GDP, \n ", "  Appendix 4  55 \ncurrently stand at $32 billion, down from their peak of $37 billion in early April. The increase in \ndomestic fuel prices combined with tighter monetary conditions should help reduce pressures on the \nbalance of payments that had emerged over the course of the year, leading to significant losses in \nforeign official reserves. That said, the current account surplus is expected to narrow further over the \nmedium term as imports rise faster than exports, financed in large part by private sector capital inflows.  \n\u2022  The overall performance of the banking sector has improved, but risks remain. In recent years, \nbanks were able to improve earnings as net interest margins improved due to lower interest rates. Asset \nquality has also improved at several banks, although some banks recently showed higher NPLs due to \nstricter classification rules enforced by BI. Going forward, rising interest rates will increase credit and \ninterest rate risks, and squeeze profit margins. \n\u2022  The authorities have continued to implement their structural reform program but faster progress \nis needed. The government is taking a number of steps to improve the private investment climate and \nreduce the high cost of doing business, including by streamlining procedures for new investment. \nRecent prosecution of a number of high level corruption cases, including at state banks, has signaled the \ngovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  improve  governance.  However,  the  operating  agreement  between \nPertamina and ExxonMobil, which will help boost oil production, is yet to be completed. Progress has \nalso been limited in the areas of revenue administration, labor market reforms, and judicial and legal \nsystems.  \nChallenges Ahead   \n\u2022  Recent events illustrate that vulnerabilities remain, and appropriate and timely policies will be critical \nto maintaining macroeconomic stability and achieve the economic objectives of high growth and \nreduced unemployment and poverty. The immediate policy priority for the authorities is maintaining \nmarket  confidence  through  careful  monitoring  of  inflation  developments  and  firm  monetary \nrestraint to contain the risk that the recent fuel price increase lead to a generalized surge in \nunderlying inflation, while implementing effectively the fuel price compensation scheme for the \npoor. These actions will help to ensure that the fall-out from the volatility in financial markets in \nearlier months does not jeopardize the achievement of the authorities\u2019 objectives of high and \nsustained growth and low unemployment and poverty. Assuming that fiscal and monetary policy \nremain prudent and progress continues to be made on structural reforms to improve the investment \nclimate, we believe that the authorities can achieve their broad economic objectives.  \n \nStatus of IMF Relations \n \n\u2022  Indonesia\u2019s Extended Arrangement with the Fund ended in December 2003 and since then the Fund has \nremained in a close policy dialogue with the authorities through post-program monitoring (PPM) and \nextensive technical assistance activities.  \n\u2022  The 2005 Article IV consultation and third PPM were completed on July 18. A data ROSC by the \nStatistics Department was also completed in July. \n\u2022  The next PPM mission is scheduled for early December, and technical assistance missions from Fiscal \nAffairs Department, the Monetary and Financial Systems Department, and the Statistics Department \nwill be in the field during November\u2013February. \n ", "   \nDEVELOPMENT PARTNERS COORDINATION MATRIX \n \n5\nCore Policy Areas  Components  ADB Support for Policy Reforms   Support from Other Development Partners  6\n \nin the Development \nPolicy Support \nA\nProgram   p\np\nI.

In September 2005 the Government presented to Parliament a Ministry of Finance (MOF) \ndecree on borrowing as its debt management strategy (No. 447/KMK.06/2005). The strategy, \ncovering 2005\u20132009, defines the scope for debt management, and focuses on the main risks, \nincluding exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and rollover risk. The strategy also describes how \nthese risks should be managed, i.e., mainly by gradually reducing the share of debt denominated \nin foreign currencies, and reducing the share of variable rate debt. \n \n  a.  External Debt \n3.  As of June 2005, more than half of the Government debt was denominated in foreign \ncurrency (Table A6.2). A very high share of the external debt is noncommercial, with the currency \ncomposition dominated by US dollars and Japanese yen (Table A6.3). Most external debt is long \nterm, and a substantial part (around 70%) at fixed interest rates, indicating that the main risk on \nthe external debt is exchange rate risk. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  61 \nTable A6.3.

Indonesia has made important inroads in improving governance since the 1997 Asian \nfinancial crisis. Corruption and public perception of corruption are discussed openly by the public \nand  the  media.  Combating  corruption  is  a  priority  under  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJM).  This  appendix  outlines  recent  progress  and  the  challenges  that \nIndonesia faces in enhancing governance and combating corruption. \n \nA.  Recent Progress \n \n2.  Political Accountability. 2004 was a landmark year in Indonesia\u2019s political history in \nenhancing electoral accountability. The first direct presidential elections were held. The legal \nframework was amended to allow for direct elections of district heads and provincial governors; \nand  such  elections  are  under  way  for  governors,  regents,  and  mayors.  As  a  testimony  to \ndemocracy and electoral accountability, in the first five cases of elections of governors, only one \nof the incumbent governors was elected. While money, politics, and corruption in candidate \nselection cannot be removed in the short term, efforts and legal reforms to improve governance \nare clearly moving in the right direction.  \n \n3.  Combating Corruption. In the first few months after the direct election in 2004, the \nPresident consistently discussed anticorruption and encouraged the relevant law enforcement \nagencies to pursue several high-profile cases. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has \nbecome a powerful institution. This and other new institutional measures against corruption, \nincluding the establishment of the Anticorruption Court, have begun to show promising results. \nThe  KPK  is  currently  handling  26  cases,  with  15  at  the  initial  exploratory  stage,  6  at  the \ninvestigation stage, and the remaining 5 being prosecuted. These range from investigations of \ncorruption  of  the  national  Government,  regional  government  institutions,  and  Parliamentary \nbodies. Some of the recent outcomes include  \n \n(i)  convictions  in  the  graft  cases  against  the  governor  of  Aceh  involving  the \nprocurement of a helicopter from the Russian Federation, leading to a 10-year jail \nsentence, Rp500 million in fines, and Rp6.6 billion in restitution;  \n(ii)  sentencing of the acting secretary general of the General Election Commission \n(KPU) and a member of the KPU to 30-month jail terms for various malpractices in \nconducting elections; \n(iii)  launching of investigations on alleged malpractices at the top leadership levels in \nBank Mandiri, the largest state-owned bank;  \n(iv)  launching of a sting operation in the Supreme Court, revealing that court officials \nand judges may have taken bribes of $1.6 million; the KPK has been impartial and \nrecently  interrogated  senior  officials,  notably  the  chief  justice  of  the  Supreme \nCourt; and \n(v)  resolving and now prosecuting several cases involving senior national Government \ncivil servants at the Anticorruption Court. \n \n4.  Designed on the Supreme Court reform blueprints, the Attorney General\u2019s Office has \nengaged  civil  society  in  formulating  its  own  blueprint  for  reform.  The  office  has  set  up  an \nanticorruption team that is making progress on a number of high-profile cases, and is considering \nreopening some of the high-profile bank fraud cases dating back to the crisis. These recent \noutcomes demonstrate a clear change in the office\u2019s willingness to deal with vested interests from \n ", "64  Appendix 7 \nthe post-crisis period, as diagnosed in comprehensive audit of the office\u2019s practices supported by \nADB in 2002.1  \n \n5.  As an integral part of judicial reforms, the independent Judicial Commission was recently \nestablished as a key constituent of the justice system. The commission will play a balancing role \nand  offset  the  constitutional  imbalances  in  institutional  accountability  that  resulted  from  the \nintroduction of the Supreme Court-centered system in 2004. The commission will advise the \nSupreme  Court  on  applying  sanctions  in  an  independent  manner.  While  its  personnel  and \noperations need to be strengthened, the commission is expected to play a critical role in the \nSupreme Court corruption case being investigated by KPK. \n \n6.  Progress  in  fighting  corruption  is  also  being  made  by  the  local  governments,  in  the \nissuance of various licenses and permits. KPU is closely monitoring the ongoing elections, with \nKPK functioning as a public watchdog.  \n \nB.  Key Challenges \n \n7.  While significant progress has been made, particularly in the last one year, much work \nremains in investigating corruption as well as curbing opportunities for systemic and institutional \ncorruption. Some key challenges are outlined here. \n \n8.  Funding. While the Anticorruption Court has been fairly successful, its ad-hoc judges \nhave worked for several months without being paid. Other Government internal control agencies \ngenerally complain about lack of resources and facilities.  Adequacy of support should be ensured \nto reinforce the Government\u2019s commitment to anticorruption. \n \n9.  Structural Change. The Supreme Court reform process points to the need for structural \nchange. The reform blueprints finalized and launched in 2003 received considerable attention and \nfunding. Yet, structural changes in the Supreme Court\u2019s operation, organization, and personnel \nsystems have been slow, stalling real progress.  \n \n10.  Civil Service Reforms. Indonesia has not yet undertaken any serious attempt to reform \nits civil service, particularly at the national level. As in many other policy areas, intergovernmental \ncoordination remains weak in the area of civil service reforms. A large number of agencies share \noverlapping and unclear responsibilities for managing the national and regional civil services, \nincluding the National Civil Service Agency, State Ministry for State Apparatus Reforms, Ministry \nof  Home  Affairs,  National  Institute  of  Public  Administration,  Ministry  of  Finance,  sectoral \nministries, and  regional  governments.  Given  the  plethora  of  institutions,  the lack  of tangible \nprogress is not surprising. While some local governments have shown commitment and taken \ninitiatives, these have been scuttled by the central institutions due to lack of coordination and \nconcerns regarding possible financial liabilities involved in large-scale reforms. \n \n11.  KPK has proposed to the President that a modernization team should be established in \nthe President\u2019s Office to strategize and manage civil service reforms. ADB, the World Bank, and \nGerman Agency for Technical Cooperation have supported KPK in developing proposals for \nvarious civil service reform strategies and sequencing. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Government of Indonesia for A Governance Audit of the Public Prosecution \nService. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 8  65 \nFIDUCIARY ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The  World  Bank,  along  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development and International Monetary Fund (IMF), has undertaken this fiduciary \nassessment for the second Development Policy Loan (DPL-2) and the proposed Development \nPolicy  Support  Program  (DPSP).  The  2001  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment \nhighlighted a number of deficiencies in Indonesia\u2019s public financial management system. The key \nconcerns were (i) an outdated legal environment for public financial management (PFM); (ii) an \nopaque and inefficient budget formulation process, including the separation of recurrent and \ndevelopment budgets; (iii) an inefficient payments system and weak monitoring arrangements; (iv) \nfragmented cash management and government banking arrangements; (v) unreliable accounting \nand reporting systems; (vi) inadequate auditing of government sectors; and (vii) overlaps between \nexternal and internal audit agencies, reflecting unclear roles and responsibilities. \n \n2.  To address these constraints, in 2002 the Government embarked on a PFM modernization \nprogram, initiating the drafting of the state finance, treasury, and audit laws. Following their \nadoption in 2003\u20132004, it initiated the implementation of the World Bank-supported Government \nFinancial Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP) in June 2004 and the \nADB-supported State Audit Reform Sector Development Program (STAR) in December 2004. \nThese two initiatives together provide a road map for PFM, building on earlier Government work.  \n \nB.  Public Financial Management Reforms \n \n3.  Key PFM reforms include the following:  \n \n(i)  The Law on State Finances (2003) provides for the basic fiscal framework, based \non international classification standards for developing the budget, a clear budget \ntimetable, and reporting requirements to Parliament. Under the law, development \nand recurrent budgets will be unified, and a medium-term expenditure framework \nsystem and performance-based budgeting introduced. \n(ii)  The National Development Planning System Law (2004) provides the legal basis \nfor  the  national  development  planning  process,  and  for  linking  planning  with \nbudgeting. \n(iii)  The  State  Treasury  Law  (2004)  outlines  the  basis  for  modernizing  budget \nexecution  and  reporting.  Treasury  reforms  being  undertaken  include  steps  to \nrationalize the current proliferation of Government bank accounts; to centralize \ncash  management,  and  simplify  and  speed  up  the  payments  system;  and  to \nimprove  reporting  on budget  execution.  Government  financial  reporting  will be \nimproved through the implementation of Government accounting standards on a \nmodified accrual basis, but with an eventual move to full accrual accounting.  \n(iv)  The State Audit Law (2004) lays out the broad legal framework for operation of the \ncountry\u2019s supreme audit institution, BPK, to reinforce its position and mandate as \nthe independent external audit institution reporting to Parliament.  \n(v)  The  Presidential  decree  on  Procurement  (No.80/2003)  introduces  many \nimprovements in the procurement regime and lays out a timetable for establishing \na national policy formulation and oversight agency. An omnibus procurement law is \nenvisaged for consolidating, clarifying, and simplifying the numerous procurement \nrules and regulations. \n ", "66  Appendix 8 \n \n4.  Several regulations have been adopted and/or are being drafted under these laws to guide \nthe Government work plan and budget, budget execution, special purpose agencies, Government \naccounting standards, procurement, onlending, cash management, grants and emergency funds, \nmedium-term expenditure framework, and Government auditing standards. \n \n5.  To  effectively  implement  the  new  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  the  Government \nrestructured  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  in  2004,  leading  to  the  establishment  of  a  new \ndirectorate general (DG) for budget and fiscal balance and a new DG for treasury, broadly in line \nwith previous IMF recommendations. All directors general and directors have been appointed. \nBoth the budget and treasury functions have been strengthened; the director general, treasury, \noversees all treasury functions including cash and debt management, fixed asset management, \nand government fiscal reporting. A description of the key steps taken follows. \n \n  a.  Budget Reforms \n \n6.  Development of annual budgets through adoption of (i) the new economic and fiscal \nframework (including a medium-term expenditure framework to be prepared on a 3-year rolling \nbasis), (ii) clearer expenditure classification, including the integration of routine and development \nbudgets; and (iii) enhanced ex post fiscal reporting through the provision of comprehensive \nfinancial statements, including a balance sheet, cash-flow statement, and the budget execution \nreport to Parliament within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. \n \n7.  Planning and budgeting functions are integrated by formally linking ministerial work plans \nwith budgets, and clarifying the respective roles of planning and budgeting functions. \n \n8.  The following changes are incorporated in the 2005 budget: \n \n(i)  A new functional and program classification, consistent with the IMF Government \nFinancial Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, is used for cash-based transactions. \nThis requires review to ensure it adequately allows program management and \nperformance budgeting approaches at the agency level.  \n(ii)  Forward estimates were introduced for the first time, although much more work \nneeds to be done to fully adopt the medium-term expenditure framework approach. \nInternational  advisers  wrote  an  extensive  number  of  papers  and  provided \npresentations  to  explain  the  concept.  The  work  plan  regulations  provide  for \nindicative budget ceilings to be issued for 2 years, but in the 2005 and 2006 \nbudgets indicative ceilings are issued only for the forthcoming budget year.  \n(iii)  Recurrent and development budgets are unified, with components from the former \ndevelopment budget classified into economic categories. \n(iv)  Limited progress has been made in developing a performance-oriented budget. \nAlthough a start has been made with the fiscal 2005 budget, full implementation \nwill take more time as understanding seems to be limited, and no clear strategy \nhas yet been developed to operationalize performance orientation.  \n \nb.  Treasury Reforms \n \n9.  Budget Execution and Public Resource Management. The new legal framework will \nallow  the  Government  to  manage  its  financial  assets,  debt,  and  cash  more  efficiently  and \neffectively.  The  MOF  reorganization  will  strengthen  accountability,  eliminate  overlap  and \nduplication of functions, and enable MOF to focus more effectively on its core functions. The \n ", "  Appendix 8  67 \ncomplementary ongoing reengineering of business processes is envisaged to introduce checks \nand balances, and diminish the potential for rent-seeking that characterized virtually all stages of \nbudget formulation and execution. \n \n10.  Rationalization of the Treasury System. The new Directorate General (DG) of Treasury \nwas established under the MOF reorganization. Regional accounting offices and local verification \noffices  have  been  merged  with  regional  administrative  offices  under  the  DG  treasury,  with \ntreasury payment and accounting field offices (KPPNs) coming under regional administrative \noffices. However progress in simplifying payments processing has been somewhat limited. While \nMOF staff have been trained, this has not yet extended to spending ministry staff, who thus lack \nawareness of the proposed changes. New processing procedures have yet to be fully developed \nand  tested.  The  shortcomings  in  the  implementation  arrangements  for  these  changes  are \nreflected  in  the  chronic  government-wide  delays  experienced  in  the  issue  of  authorization \ndocuments by the Treasury Department of Budget this year.  \n \n11.  The  planned  introduction  of  a  treasury  single  account  (TSA)  and  automation  of  the \ntreasury payment system are key reforms. Progress in this area has been slow, although a \ndetailed work plan has now been developed, especially for establishing the TSA, which involves \nthe  progressive  rationalization  of  a  vast  number  of  separate  government  bank  accounts. \nSubstantial idle cash balances continue.  \n \n12.  In the area of fiscal reporting, the State Treasury Law requirement for the complete \nintroduction of accrual accounting by 2008 is very ambitious. The transition to the accruals-based \nGFSM 2001 needs to be gradual, recognizing its dependence on an operational TSA, a double-\nentry ledger system allowing for the regular reconciliation of accounting and bank information, and \nthe  new  state  treasury  and  budget  system.  The  latest  annual  Government-wide  financial \nstatements for 2003, which include a balance sheet as well as a budget execution statement, are \nof doubtful quality, reflecting inadequate information on financial assets (including cash) and \nliabilities,  lack  of  other  accruals-based  information,  failure  to  fully  reconcile  banking  and \naccounting information from line ministries, and shortcomings in accounting skills in the line \nministries.   \n \n13.  Development and Adoption of Government Accounting Standards. The Accounting \nStandards Committee, which has been in operation for a few years, has put in place a due \nprocess for the development of Government accounting standards that are well aligned with \ncomparable international standards. An initial set of 11 government accounting standards have \nbeen formally adopted through a Presidential decree (No. 25/2005). These standards are based \non a modified accrual approach and cover a budget implementation report, overall cash-flow \nstatement, and supplementary information on various assets and liabilities to be elaborated in a \nbalance  sheet.  Each  ministry  and  agency  is  required  to  prepare  a  financial  accountability \nstatement, based on these standards. Implementing these new standards across government will \nrequire extensive training and some reengineering of related business processes in line ministries \nand agencies. This task will impose challenges, given the inherently weak capacities in ministries.   \n \n  c.  Audit Issues \n \n14.  The Supreme Audit Institution. The new Audit Law strengthens the role of BPK and \nclarifies its role across all three levels of government. BPK has independence in determining the \nscope of audits. It can audit all government entities and operations as it deems appropriate. In \naddition, public disclosure of all BPK audit reports is now mandatory. Overlap and duplication on \naudit mandates between BPK and the State Audit and Inspection Agency (BPKP) and inspectors \n ", "68  Appendix 8 \ngeneral need to be resolved satisfactorily. In the past, BPK received technical assistance under a \nWorld Bank-financed project that closed in 2004. More attention is required to improve the BPK \nresources  and  capacity.  BPKP\u2019s  national  and  subnational  mandate  has  diminished,  and  its \nrelationship with BPK remains unclear. Overall, audit arrangements remain weak and ADB\u2019s \nSTAR Program is under implementation to help strengthen internal and external audit capacity \nand clarify relative responsibilities.  \n \nC.  Future Public Financial Management Reforms  \n \n15.  To ensure a sound fiduciary environment in the country, reforms will be needed for \n \n(i)  increasing  integrity  and  effective  execution  of  public  expenditures  through  the \nissuance and implementation of regulations for the state finances, treasury, and \naudit laws; establishing a treasury single account; and automating the treasury \npayments system; \n(ii)  streamlining  public  procurement  through  the  establishment  of  a  national \nprocurement policy office; \n(iii)  strengthening  public  expenditure  oversight  by  enhancing  the  capacity  of  BPK, \nstrengthening legislative capacity for oversight of budget execution, and eliminating \nthe overlap in internal audit entities\u2019 mandates; \n(iv)  increasing  revenue  collection  and  eliminating  revenue  leakage  through \ngovernance-  and  accountability-enhancing  reforms  for  the  tax  and  customs \nadministrations; \n(v)  implementing  a  government  financial  management  information  system  and \nsuccessfully implementing Government accounting standards; and \n(vi)  undertaking complementary reforms outlined above in this assessment. \n \na.  Integrating Off-Budget Operations into the Budget  \n \n16.  Budgets are still not comprehensive, in that the full extent and magnitude of off-budget \noperations are not known in several institutions. A first step will be for MOF through the DG \nBudget to establish an inventory of these institutions and then develop a phased plan for their \nintegration into the consolidated budget.  \n \n  b.   Improving Fiscal Reporting by Subnational Governments \n \n17.  Subnational governments now account for about one third of total fiscal activity. Three \nproblems  prevent  MOF  from  compiling  adequate  consolidated  fiscal  reports  on  subnational \ngovernments: they do not in all cases provide the required information (their approved budgets \nand quarterly budget execution reports) to MOF (and spending ministries); what information is \nprovided is often of poor quality; and two separate and different reporting requirements are \nrequired,  promulgated  by  MOF  and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  respectively.  The  reporting \nrequirements need to be rationalized and mechanisms for enforcement developed.  \n \n  c.  Improving Financial Monitoring of State-Owned Enterprises \n \n18.  BPK is conducting a special program of state-owned enterprises. However, MOF and \nrelevant sector ministries need a systematic approach to ensure state-owned enterprises operate \nto financial and other performance targets, with reliable, timely, and transparent reporting of their \nresults. \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  69 \n19.  A modernized state treasury and budget system would be the central element of financial \nmanagement and accounting operations in Indonesia. The state treasury and budget system will \naccomplish the following: \n \n(i)  Include core functional requirements for budget execution, covering all aspects. \n(ii)  Record and process all state budget transactions, and incorporate aggregate data \nfrom  other  elements  of  general  Government  accounting  system  as  rapidly  as \npossible. \n(iii)  Record all relevant stages of the payments and receipts processes and enable \nreports to be made on key variables, such as commitments, funds available, bills \noutstanding,  and  payments  and  receipts  (both  cash  and  accruals  basis);  for \nindividual agencies and at various levels of aggregation. \n(iv)  Incorporate  controls  on  any  specified  variables  as  necessary,  for  instance  to \nensure that commitments do not exceed available funds. \n(v)  Generate standard monthly reports and provide query facilities to determine the \nbudgetary position of agencies, the state budget, and the general government \nbudget. \n(vi)  Maintain data according to the budget classification for as many past years as \nrequired, and allow projections of up to 3 years. \n(vii)  Facilitate reconciliation between treasury system accounts and banking data by \ngenerating  chronological  lists  of  transactions  in  a  form  comparable  to  those \ngenerated by the banks.  \n(viii)  Ensure compatibility of the system with other systems, such as those for tax and \ncustoms  administrations.  The  treasury  system  will  also  support  the  budget \npreparation process. \n \n20.  To  support  these  reforms,  the  Government  has  been  implementing  the  World  Bank-\nfinanced GFMRAP and the ADB-financed STAR Program.  MOF envisages the GFMRAP as the \numbrella for sequencing PFM and revenue administration reforms, and for aid coordination.1  \nGFMRAP-I (2004\u20132008) focuses on improving PFM. It supports strengthening policy capacity in \nMOF  and  BAPPENAS,  budget  policy  and  formulation,  budget  implementation  and  treasury \nmodernization,  public  procurement  reform,  and  implementation  of  public  sector  accounting \nstandards. It also pilots activities supportive of revenue administration reforms (such as the \nestablishment of an investigations unit and making the Tax Court more transparent and efficient), \nand strengthening legislative oversight of budget formulation and execution.  \n \n21.  The ADB-financed STAR Program aims to strengthen the legal and institutional framework \nfor internal and external audit. It provides support for strengthening the Supreme Audit Institution \n(the BPK) as well as for clarifying internal and external audit roles and responsibilities, and \nstrengthening audit capacity and infrastructure for national and local governments. The executive-\nParliamentary interface will also be strengthened. \n \n22.  Public Sector Institutional Reform Agenda. While significant progress has been made \nin terms of first steps to improve the PFM system, a huge agenda remains. This entails significant \nchanges in processes and practices, as well as technological change. It also implies that the civil \n                                                 \n1  In designing and implementing the overall reform program, the Government has been receiving technical support \nfrom multilateral partners such as ADB, IMF, United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Commission \non Trade and Development, and World Bank, and from bilateral partners such as Australian Aid Agency, Canadian \nInternational Development Agency, European Union, German Agency for Technical Cooperation, and United States \nAgency for International Development. \n ", "70  Appendix 8 \nservice  will  require  appropriate  incentives,  such  as  merit-based  recruitment  and  promotions, \nadequate and transparent compensation, and effective integrity systems.  \n \n23.  Management  of  Foreign  Exchange.  Under  the  extended  IMF  arrangement,  Bank \nIndonesia was subject to the transitional procedures under IMF\u2019s safeguards assessment policy. \nThis required a review of Bank Indonesia\u2019s external audit mechanism, which was completed on \n15  March  2002.  The  assessment  recommended  remedial  actions  to  address  a  number  of \nvulnerabilities. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment \nof an independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia and the publication of Bank Indonesia\u2019s \naudited financial statements. Audited financial statements and related audit reports for Bank \nIndonesia were reviewed and no major concerns were raised in these reports. \n \nD.  Conclusion \n \n24.  In  the  course  of  completing  analytical  work  and  engaging  with  the  Government  on \ndeveloping the reform program, a good understanding of the financial management system in the \ncountry has been developed and weaknesses in the  fiduciary environment identified. These \nweaknesses  are  being  addressed  through  the  PFM  reform  program,  supported  by  the  DPL \ntriggers as well as the GFMRAP, the STAR Program, and other initiatives. Overall, progress is \nbeing  made  in  the  right  and  consistent  direction,  albeit  slow,  and  the  Government  has \ndemonstrated  significant  commitment  for  completing  these  reforms.  Taking  these  into \nconsideration, no additional or special fiduciary arrangements are proposed.  \n ", "  Appendix 8  71 \nTable A8: Status of Country Financial Accountability Assessment, Key Recommendations  \nCountry Financial Accountability Assessment  Status \nRecommendation  October 2005 \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) has five basic strategies for poverty reduction: (i) broadening \nopportunities, (ii) empowering community institutions, (iii) increasing capacity, (iv) providing social protection, and (v) \npromoting global partnerships. The NPRS is to be implemented through macroeconomic strategy and policies for \nfulfilling basic rights, for promoting gender justice and equality, and regional development. The NPRS considers \nmacroeconomic policies as the foundation for reducing poverty through a supportive business environment and broad \nopportunities for increasing the capability of the poor through four related objectives to (i) create macroeconomic \nstability, (ii) promote economic growth, (iii) increase opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship, and (iv) \nreduce inequalities between regions. The NPRS considers the willingness of central and local governments to manage \nthe budget in an open, accountable, efficient, and effective way\u2014 an essential prerequisite for implementing the \nNPRS. It recognizes that partnerships are necessary for implementing the NPRS with the private sector and financial \nand nonfinancial banking Institutions identified as key stakeholders.  \n \nThe country poverty assessment1 and country poverty partnership agreement2 consider macroeconomic stability as a \nfundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. Under the agreement, ADB has agreed to support the Government to \npromote macroeconomic stability for inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Highest priority is given to institutional \nreforms to achieve transparent and accountable institutions. The poverty agreement also calls for expansion and \nimprovement of key basic services such as health, education, water supply, and sanitation through public-private \npartnerships and the need to expand a system of social protection. At the same time, the poverty partnership \nagreement notes the tremendous fiscal constraint facing the Government in the medium term and therefore the need \nto make the best use of existing resources.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                              Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Development Policy Support Program (DPSP) directly supports implementation of the NPRS as envisioned by the \npoverty partnership agreement. The DPSP focuses on key areas central to implementing the NPRS strategy. The core \nareas of the program are   \n \n(i)  ensuring macroeconomic stability,  \n(ii)  improving the investment climate,  \n(iii)  improving public financial management, and  \n(iv)  ensuring services work for the poor (new pillar in the forward-looking program).   \n \nThe actions under each of these core areas directly correspond to the NPRS strategy or implementing mechanism. \nThe links between DPSP actions and the NPRS are shown in Table A10. \n \nThe DPSP actions are essential for implementing the NPRS. In the face of limited resources, the Government cannot \nmaintain significant subsidies to the non-poor. Without the fuel price increases announced in early October 2005, the \nfuel subsidy would have accounted for about 20% of overall Government expenditures. Manageable and well-targeted \nsubsidies and a well-functioning tax system are essential components of effective and efficient management of state \nbudget and revenues. The measures adopted under the Program to reorient public expenditures to productive uses, \nsuch as health, education, and basic infrastructure, will help alleviate the significant development constraints and \nregional disparities faced in Indonesia. Borrowing is a significant source of development funds while onlending and on-\ngranting from national to local governments are tools for development spending. Developing a debt management \nstrategy ensures optimal use of borrowing instruments. Lessons learned from the implementation of the Ministry of \nFinance decree KMK 35 for onlending and on-granting will provide a more efficient and effective instrument to channel \nfunds  for  regional  development  including  development  of  essential  services.    Enhanced  transparency  and \naccountability in state finances is necessary to ensure that public funds are used as planned, besides enabling the \npublic  to  participate  in  policy  making  and  to  judge  the  performance  of  elected  officials.  Development  and \nimplementation  of  a  single  treasury  account  and  establishing  a  unit  to  investigate  fraud  will  increase  overall \naccountability.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

The DPSP also \nsupports measures to boost confidence in the financial system, which in turn will lead to greater resource mobilization \nof short- and long-term funds. The DPSP\u2019s focus on risk-sharing to encourage private sector participation will help \nmeet the pent-up demand for infrastructure needed to provide basic services and to attract productive investments to \ngenerate employment. The medium-term action plan and framework to coordinate the development of small- and \nmedium-sized enterprises will provide more effective support to a key source of employment for the poor and near \npoor.    \nC.

The improved \npoverty orientation of public spending increases women\u2019s access to essential services for achieving Millennium \nDevelopment Goal targets including reducing child and maternal mortality. Improvement of the financial management \nsystems of the Government through increased transparency and accountability will provide the civil society with basic \ninformation necessary to monitor Government actions, and enable it to provide inputs into policy and budget decisions. \n ", "76  Appendix 10   \nA strengthened civil society provides women with a more effective channel for voicing their priorities. An improved \ninvestment climate is expected to provide greater opportunities for women, who experience significantly higher rates of \nunemployment, even when controlling for experience and level of education. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Yes \nNot significant  Removal of the kerosene subsidy will have an impact on almost   \n  everyone. In addition, higher transportation costs\u2014stemming  X  No \n None  from the reduction of the other fuel subsidies\u2014will result in \nincreased consumer prices for goods purchased and reduced \nproducer prices for goods sold. As a result, the purchasing \npower of the public will be reduced in general. The near poor, \nthose with incomes less than 1.2 times the poverty line may \nalso fall into poverty as a result of general price increases. \nNonetheless,  the  reduction  of  fuel  subsidies  provides  the \nGovernment with significant opportunities for redirecting public \nspending  to  the  needs  of  the  poor,  and  enhancing  overall \neconomic welfare. In particular, the large fuel subsidies created \nperverse  incentives  resulting  in  large-scale  misdirection  of \npublic resources and crowded out productive investments in \nbasic  services  and  infrastructure.  In  March  2005,  the \nGovernment  raised  the  price  of  fuel  by  30%,  excluding \nkerosene.  As  a  result,  kerosene  was  diverted  for  other \npurposes,  household  kerosene  became  scarce,  and  retail \nprices  rose.  This  experience  demonstrated  there  was  no \neffective  way  to  maintain  any  significant  gap  between \nhousehold and industry prices. The Government\u2019s Fuel Subsidy \nCash Transfer Scheme covering the poor and near poor is \nsufficient to offset the direct increase in the price of kerosene. \nPoor and near poor households consume about 17 liters of \nkerosene per month for cooking and boiling water. The cash \ntransfer of Rp100,000 per month is more than sufficient to cover \nthe net increase in the price of kerosene of Rp1,400 per liter or \nRp23,800  for  17  liters.  The  balance  of  Rp76,200  is  also \nsufficient to cover a 16% increase in the cost of other basic \ncommodities, a level that exceeds the current predictions of \ninflation. With improvements in the cash transfer system over \ntime, along with other measures to increase investments in \nhealth, education, and basic infrastructure, the adverse impact \non the poor will be further reduced. On the basis of these \nfactors, no separate plan is required to mitigate the negative \nimpact on affordability. \nLabor   Significant  The impact on labor is positive in the near to short term through   \n  improvement in the investment climate.

The immediate impact of general price \nincreases generated by the reduction in fuel subsidies may \nspeed  up  the  closure  of  marginal  industries.  This  negative \nemployment impact is likely to be offset by the compensation \nprogram  consisting  of  basic  infrastructure  investments, \nproviding  opportunities  for  casual  labor.  In  addition,  the \ncompensation  programs  for  health  and  education  will  help \nreduce household expenses. Any initial negative impact on \n ", "  Appendix 10  77 \nlabor  is  likely  to  be  offset  over  time  from  the  additional \nemployment generated by increased government spending on \nproductive investments.  \nIndigenous   Significant  Neutral impact   \nPeoples     Yes \n Not significant   \n  X  No \nX None \nOther Risks  X   Significant  External  factors  (increasing  terrorist  acts  or  pandemic)  or   \nand/or    political disturbances could result in incomplete implementation   Yes \nVulnerabilities   Not significant  of  the  policies  or  delay  in  achieving  anticipated  benefits.   \n    Resistance to the reduction in the fuel subsidies so far has  x No  \n None  been relatively limited.
