INTRODUCTION \n1.  Financial  inclusion  is  broadly  recognized  as  a  key  to  development,  because  of  its \npositive effects on economic growth and poverty reduction.1 Financial inclusion evolved from the \nmodern microfinance movement and aims to empower poor individuals, low-income households, \nand small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through affordable access to and adequate \nusage of a broad range of regulated financial products and services, including credit, deposit, \ninsurance, remittance, and payment.  \n \n2.  Financial inclusion has gained tremendous political momentum since it was incorporated \nin the Group of Twenty (G20) development agenda at the Pittsburgh Summit in September 2009. \nIn 2010, the G20 financial inclusion initiative was marked by two major milestones: adoption of \nthe nine principles for innovative financial inclusion at the Toronto Summit,2 and the launch of \nthe Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) following the Seoul Summit.3 In addition to \nthe global forum under the G20, financial inclusion is also being pursued by the Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Pacific \nIslands Financial Inclusion Working Group.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, adopted in 2011 to guide implementation of \nthe financial sector agendas under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, identified financial inclusion as one of \nthe two priority areas for ADB operations in the financial sector.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  ADB has been very active in the area of financial inclusion. Under the ADB project \nclassification system, at least two of the financial sector\u2019s nine subsectors\u2014microfinance, and \nSME finance and leasing\u2014deal with financial inclusion issues.5 As of 7 September 2012, ADB \nhad approved 121 projects amounting to $2.59 billion for microfinance and 92 projects worth \n$1.5 billion for SME finance and leasing, including public sector loans, technical assistance (TA), \ngrants, and nonsovereign operations. In light of the keen interest of ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries (DMCs) in financial inclusion initiatives at global and regional forums and in light of the \nFinancial Sector Operational Plan, ADB should strengthen its assistance to DMCs and play a \nleading role in steering and advancing financial inclusion in Asia and the Pacific. To this end, it \nis important to address several issues.  \n                                                \n1  R. Cull, A. Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and T. Lyman. 2012.

ADBI Working Paper Series, no. 259. Tokyo: Asian Development Bank Institute. \n2  The nine principles are (i)  leadership, (ii) diversity  of approaches, (iii) innovation, (iv) consumer  protection, \n(v) empowerment of consumers, (vi) cooperation of all actors, (vii) knowledge sharing, (viii) proportionality between \nrisks and regulatory solutions, and (ix) a flexible, inclusive regulatory framework. G20 Information Centre. Principles \nfor Innovative Financial Inclusion. http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2010/to-principles.html \n3  The GPFI comprises three subgroups, covering (i) financial inclusion principles and standard-setting bodies, \n(ii) SME finance and women entrepreneurship, and (iii) data and target setting. For its main achievements in 2011, \nsee GPFI. 2011. Report to the Leaders. G20 Leaders Summit. Cannes. 11 November. \nhttp://www.gpfi.org/knowledge-bank/publications/gpfi-report-g-20-leaders \n4  The other priority area is capital markets for infrastructure finance. ADB. 2011.

ADB projects classified under other sectors may also involve access to finance \ncomponents. \n ", "2 \n \n \n5.  Peer learning and knowledge sharing. A key approach adopted by the G20 financial \ninclusion action plan was peer learning and knowledge sharing among stakeholders, particularly \nin developing countries. This approach has recently been highlighted again and encouraged by \nG20  leaders  as  a  way  to  effectively  implement  the  G20  principles  for  innovative  financial \ninclusion.6 ADB\u2019s past operations on financial inclusion produced many project documents, \nconsultants\u2019 reports, and performance reviews from which experience and lessons could be \nderived  on  the  design  and  implementation  of  financial  inclusion  strategies,  programs,  and \nprojects in different contexts and in the face of various constraints. However, a user-friendly and \nsearchable \u2015knowledge base\u2016 is currently not available for DMCs and other stakeholders to \nconveniently access this information. \n \n6.  Financial inclusion in Asia and the Pacific. Financial inclusion is a relatively new, \nevolving initiative that came to the attention of high-level policy dialogues primarily through \nglobal forums, and in particular the G20. These have set forth very broad principles, whose \nimplementation requires a good understanding of the special characteristics and context in each \nregion and country. Asia and the Pacific is a very disparate region, economically and socially, \nwith specific features and particular challenges for financial inclusion, such as (i) government-\ndominant  models,  with  extensive  networks  of  postal  banks  in  most  countries;  (ii)  savings \ncultures; (iii) active informal markets for lending, insurance, and remittance; and (iv) migration of \nlabor within countries and abroad. In-depth analysis and understanding of issues that are of \npertinent interest and relevance for Asia and the Pacific would be a prerequisite for effective, \ncontext-specific implementation of the G20 principles for innovative financial inclusion.  \n \n7.  Financial  consumer  protection  and  financial  literacy.  The  2007\u20132009  global \neconomic  crisis  and  incidents  in  local  microfinance  markets  have  underscored  the  critical \nimportance  of  financial  consumer  protection  and  financial  literacy  as  elements  of  financial \ninclusion. High-level principles for financial consumer protection were endorsed by the G20 in \n2011, while national strategies for financial education were endorsed in 2012. At the Los Cabos \nSummit in June 2012, G20 leaders further emphasized this subject by supporting the creation of \na fourth GPFI subgroup that will focus on consumer protection and financial literacy. ADB\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Department has addressed these issues and indicated in its special \nevaluation study on ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development Strategy that ADB should place greater \nfocus on clients, in particular on consumer protection and financial literacy.7 \n \n8.  The foregoing (paras. 5\u20137) does not cover all the issues raised by financial inclusion in \nAsia and the Pacific. However, these three interconnected areas reflect the most recent trends \nin financial inclusion, emphasize the relevance of the efforts for the region and DMCs\u2019 needs, \nand attempt to make optimum use of ADB\u2019s experience in taking a leading role in promoting \nfinancial inclusion regionally. Addressing these issues would be particularly helpful to ensure the \nrelevance,  effectiveness,  and  overall  quality  of  financial  inclusion  projects  that  ADB  is \nprocessing or planning with DMCs. Furthermore, the TA will also better prepare DMCs to take \nadvantage of new opportunities offered by financial inclusion in Asia and the Pacific, and gain \nmore confidence in embracing new and scaled up financial inclusion projects in their country \nprogramming process with ADB.  \n                                                \n6  G20 Leaders Declaration.

The impact of the TA will be improved financial inclusion in Asia and the Pacific. The \noutcome will be better understanding and enhanced capacity of ADB\u2019s DMCs in promoting \nfinancial inclusion.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will provide support at the regional level to DMCs through three outputs: (i) a \nknowledge platform for financial inclusion, (ii) a study on selected issues related to financial \ninclusion,  and  (iii)  diagnosis  and  experience  sharing  on financial  consumer  protection  and \nfinancial literacy. \n \n11.  Output 1. The knowledge platform, to be hosted on the ADB website, will focus on \nproviding a comprehensive and user-friendly source of information on ADB\u2019s experience and \nlessons from previous operations related to financial inclusion. To this end, an overall plan will \nbe developed to (i) structure and classify the contents of the knowledge platform, (ii) set up key \nsubjects or themes to facilitate online research by users, and (iii) establish a mechanism for the \nmaintenance  and  updating  of  the  knowledge  platform.  The  platform  will  be  created  in \nconsultation with the Office of Information Systems and Technology (OIST) to ensure linkages \nwith its work on data integration and knowledge platforms in collaboration with the Economics \nand Research Department (ERD) and the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI). \n \n12.  ADB project documents, consultants\u2019 reports, and performance review reports related to \nfinancial inclusion will be collected, summarized or annotated, and posted online under a set of \nyet-to-be-determined  themes.8 This  will  be  undertaken  in  coordination  with  the  knowledge \nsharing and services center of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), \nwhich is designing an ADB-wide framework to extract and share embedded knowledge from \nADB operations.  \n \n13.  The same thematic index will also be used as the basis for posting and regular online \nupdating of information on the latest trends and literature on financial inclusion. In addition, a \nquarterly e-newsletter on financial inclusion will be issued as a platform for ADB staff and \nconsultants and other practitioners to share insights, experience, and summary publications on \nfinancial inclusion. At the completion of the TA, the knowledge platform will be maintained, with \nthe contents to be adjusted if necessary based on feedback from DMCs and other users. \nFunding to sustain the knowledge platform will be provided from a follow-up TA or through \nreassignment of staff resources within OREI.  \n \n14.  Output 2. The study on selected issues related to financial inclusion will help decision \nmakers and other stakeholders in DMCs in considering key issues and concepts relating to \nfinancial inclusion that are of particular relevance for Asia and the Pacific. Major topics would \ntentatively include (i) partnerships between the public and private sectors to extend financial \nservices to the poor and reduce poverty without distorting the market; (ii) the role of state-owned \nfinancial institutions in financial inclusion, and reforms needed to enable them to fulfill this role; \n(iii) the impact of restrictions on interest rates in microfinance; (iv) the impact of trade financing \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n8  Possible themes include the legal environment, financial infrastructure, credit bureaus, formalization of MFIs, \ndevelopment of institutional capacity, responsible finance, pricing, skills development of clients, and weather index \ninsurance.   \n ", "4 \n \non access to financing for SMEs; (v) a comparative study of legal concepts and practical \napplications of a \u2015level playing field\u2016 for market-oriented financial inclusion; and (vi) constraints, \napplicability,  and  lessons from mobile  technology-based financial  services  in  Asia  and the \nPacific. This list will be fine-tuned based on surveys that will be conducted with ADB operations \nstaff and DMC officials. When relevant and appropriate, the study will analyze the policies, legal \nframeworks, and practical experience of developed countries for comparison and as a reference \nfor DMCs. The study will be conducted in coordination as necessary with concerned centers of \nexcellence on financial inclusion, such as the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor. Depending \non the topics and areas covered by the studies, the major findings and recommendations will be \ndisseminated  through  pertinent  global  or  regional  workshops  and  conferences  on  financial \ninclusion attended by ADB. Dissemination will primarily be the responsibility of ADB staff, but \ncould also be undertaken by the study authors as needed (funding for this is budgeted under the \nTA).  \n \n15.  Output  3.  The  diagnosis  and  experience  sharing  regarding  financial  consumer \nprotection and financial literacy will target DMCs that have received ADB lending support for \nmicrofinance and SME finance\u2014a total of 15 countries.9 This component will concentrate on \n(i) financial consumer protection and financial literacy general principles and best practices \n(including  regulatory  and  supervisory  frameworks,  self-regulation  and  responsible  business \nconduct, recourse mechanisms and law enforcement, governance and transparency, usury \nrates and predatory lending, overindebtedness and reckless credit, debt collection practices, \nfinancial literacy and education, individual insolvency and bankruptcy); (ii) diagnosis of policy \nand  legal  frameworks  and  current  practices  regarding  financial  consumer  protection  and \nfinancial literacy in participating DMCs; (iii) case studies of success stories and lessons in these \nDMCs; and (iv) recommendations for policy makers on possible options to enhance financial \nconsumer protection and improve financial literacy under the overall framework of financial \ninclusion.  \n \n16.  Each financial consumer protection and financial literacy diagnosis and case study is \nexpected  to  be  country-specific,  addressing  particular  needs  and  constraints  in  individual \nparticipating DMCs. These will be conducted by each country\u2019s national consultant, under the \nguidance of the international consultant for output 3. The inputs of the national consultants will \nbe discussed and supplemented at a consultation workshop at ADB headquarters that will be \nattended by officials from participating DMCs. These inputs as well as the outcome of the \nconsultation  workshop  will  be  consolidated  into  the  general  report  on  financial  consumer \nprotection and financial literacy in ADB DMCs. \n \n17.  The prospectus and e-link to the knowledge platform that will be created by the TA under \nthe ADB website will be provided to leading knowledge centers in financial inclusion industry for \nwider dissemination on their websites.10 All reports and other outputs resulting from the TA will \nbe  posted  on  the  knowledge  platform.  The  studies  of  selected  issues  related  to  financial \ninclusion under output 2 and the general report on financial consumer protection and financial \nliteracy  under  output  3  will  also  be  disseminated  through  financial  sector  development \ncommunity of practice knowledge events within ADB, as well as through appropriate workshops \nand knowledge events outside ADB. Partnership will be actively sought for translation and \npublication of the studies and report in local languages.  \n                                                \n9  Invitation to participate in activities under output 3 will be issued to Bangladesh, Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China,  India,  Indonesia, Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Pakistan,  Papua  New  Guinea,  the \nPhilippines, Tajikistan, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam.  \n10 Such as the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, Microfinance Gateway, MIX \nMarket, and the Pacific Financial Inclusion Program. Collaboration to efficiently share and make best use of \nknowledge and information hosted on each knowledge center\u2019s website will also be explored.  \n ", "5 \n \n18.  The above activities and outputs will provide improved access to knowledge, experience, \ninsights, and lessons on financial inclusion; clarify key issues on financial inclusion in the \ncontext of Asia and the Pacific; and improve financial consumer protection and financial literacy, \nwhich will help ADB\u2019s DMCs better understand, enhance their capacity to promote, and improve \nthe environment for financial inclusion. Based on DMCs\u2019 needs and in coordination with ADB\u2019s \noperations departments, the TA studies and report could be converted to training materials in \npossible follow-up country or regional-level TA for capacity development of policy makers, \nfinancial regulators and supervisors, and other practitioners of financial inclusion.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund and administered by ADB;11 and \n(ii) $250,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. No activities will be \nundertaken in a participating country until the requisite no-objection has been or is deemed to \nhave been obtained.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by OREI from January \n2013  to  March  2015. Seven  international  consultants  (17  person-months)  and  18  national \n \nconsultants (67 person-months) will help with TA implementation. The assignments will be \ncarried out independently, and the TA will engage individual consultants with demonstrated \nexpertise in the area and research subject. An ADB staff team from OREI12 will regularly monitor \nand administer the individual contracts, and manage the combined outputs to achieve the TA \nobjectives.  \n \n21.  The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n22.  ADB will purchase equipment (i.e., computer hardware and software) in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and in coordination with \nthe Office of Information Systems and Technology and the Office of Administrative Services, \nwhere applicable. After TA completion, any equipment that was procured will be disposed of in \ncompliance with the project administration instructions on administering grant-financed TA.\n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund, and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis, for Improving \nFinancial Inclusion in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n11 Contributor: the Government of Luxembourg. \n12 The team will work closely with OIST, RSDD, and ERD to ensure linkages of output 1 with ADB-wide work on data \nintegration and knowledge platforms.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \n       \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved financial  By the end of 2018:  World Bank global  DMC governments \ninclusion in Asia and  Three percentage point  financial inclusion  remain committed to \nthe Pacific  increase from 2011 base  database (Global  financial inclusion \n  line in financial inclusion  Findex)   agenda \nas per the major indicators   \nRisk \nin Findex.  \n  Changes in \n2011 baseline: various  governments or \npercentages for adults  government policies \nborrowing and saving at a  hinder participating \nformal financial institution  DMCs from \nin the past year in East  implementing policy \nAsia and Pacific, South  recommendations \nAsia, and Central Asia, \nbased on the World Bank \nPolicy Research Working \nPaper No. 602513 \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nBetter understanding  For ADB financial inclusion  ADB project completion  TA outputs are properly  \nand enhanced  projects processed in  reports and TA  disseminated to DMC \ncapacity of ADB\u2019s  2015\u20132016:  completion reports   governments \nDMCs in promoting  Proportion of TA and loan     \nfinancial inclusion  projects rated successful    DMCs\u2019 officials refer to \nor highly successful    the knowledge platform \nincreases by two    and other outputs of the \npercentage points (2001\u2013   TA for learning and \n2010 baseline: average of    capacity development \n60.9% for microfinance,     \n66.7% for SME finance    Governments in DMCs \nand leasing, and 33.3% for    take into account \ninsurance and contractual    knowledge and \nsavings)     experience shared \n    through this TA in the \nBy end of 2016:    formulation of policy \nAt least two participating  State of Financial  and strategy, as well as \nDMCs adopt policy or  Access Report of the  in the design and \nlegislation for consumer  Consultative Group to  implementation of \nprotection (2010 baseline:  Assist the Poor or the  financial inclusion \nOnly 4 of the 15 DMCs  World Bank  projects  \nthat will be invited to     \nparticipate in output 3 \n                                                \n13 A.
