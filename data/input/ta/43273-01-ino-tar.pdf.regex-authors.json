In  May  2009,  the  Government  of  Indonesia agreed  that  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  and  European  Union  (EU)  joint  education  program, \nenvisaged  to  commence  in  2010,  be  designated  the  Education  Sector  Support  Program \n(ESSP). Conceptualizing the design of the proposed ESSP began in October 2008 with a joint \nAusAID\u2013EU feasibility study. The ESSP will contribute to the implementation of Indonesia's \nmedium-term development policies and strategies for poverty reduction, the achievement of \neducation for all (EFA) and the education-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and \nimproved regional and global economic competitiveness. The ESSP consists of (i) policy-led EU \nsector budget support with agreed arrangements for results-led grant disbursement1 and (ii) \nearmarked policy and program-led AusAID sector development grant support consisting of a \nschool  infrastructure  program,  a  nationwide  district  and  school  management  development \nprogram, and a program to accelerate the government's accreditation of private madrasahs. \nBoth programs are to be underpinned by a joint AusAID\u2013EU results framework with specified \nindicators  and  targets  and  aligned  with  education  strategic  plan,  or  Renstra  2010\u20132014, \nimplementation.2 \n \n2.  To accelerate progress toward strengthening quality throughout the education sector \nand to support ESSP implementation, AusAID and the EU have undertaken to provide about \n$50.0 million over the 5 years of the government\u2019s planning cycle 2010\u20132014 for analytical and \ncapacity development. The objective is to help promote policy dialogue and institutional and \norganizational reform that will underpin policy implementation and help reduce disparities in \nprovincial and district education performance. The facility, called the Education Sector Analytical \nand Capacity Development Partnership (ESACDP), is an integral part of the ESSP and will \nsupport the government\u2019s realization of the 2010\u20132014 medium-term development plan and \neducation Renstra targets.3 AusAID, the EU, and the Government of Indonesia have invited the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to join the partnership to manage ESACDP resources on \nbehalf of the government. The ESACDP design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The \nESSP results framework is in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  The invitation for ADB to join the ESACDP has been influenced by a number of factors, \nin  particular  the  commitment  ADB  has  shown  over  the  past  3.5  decades  to  support  the \ngovernment's efforts to improve the quality of education services and access to them. Since \n1975, ADB has provided $2.0 billion to help the government strengthen the education sector, \nwith a recent focus on supporting improvements in post-basic education. ADB has developed a \ngood  working  relationship  with  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS), \nMinistry of National Education (MONE), Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA), and Ministry of \nHome Affairs (MOHA). ADB\u2019s extensive experience in Indonesia and its familiarity with similar \npolicy-led macro and sector support makes it a complementary ESACDP partner. In line with \nthe  Paris  Declaration  and  the  Jakarta  Commitment4 to  strengthen  aid  effectiveness  and \ninclusive partnership for development, the ESACDP will constitute a harmonized approach to \nsupport  (i)  sector  analytical  work  including  research  and  studies,  incorporating  macro  and \n                                                 \n1  The objectives of EU assistance are to support education Renstra 2010\u20132014 policies for accomplishing EFA and \neducation-related MDGs nationwide, including (i) equitable access to high-quality basic education, (ii) improved \nquality and relevance of basic education, and (iii) improved governance and accountability. \n2  The Government of Australia will contribute approximately A$500 million over 2010\u20132015, with indicative annual \ndisbursements of around A$100 million; the EU will provide \u20ac200 million over 2010\u20132012, with additional funding \nover 2013\u20132014 subject to joint government and EU review and negotiation.  \n3  The Renstra strategic plan supports the government\u2019s medium-term development plan. The Renstra is a planning \ndocument for the education sector that outlines policy and direction for 5 years. \n4  The Jakarta Commitment is based on Paris Declaration principles and commitments and has been adopted by \nADB, the Government of Australia, and the Delegation of the European Union in January 2009. \n ", "2   \ncrosscutting  issues;  (ii)  the  assessment  and  audit  of  institutional  and  organizational \narrangements; and (iii) central, provincial, and district sector capacity development planning. \n \n4.  The  ESACDP  concept  was  developed  in  close  cooperation  with  government \nstakeholders from BAPPENAS, MONE, and MORA, as well as AusAID and the EU. During a \nnational  workshop  in  November  2009,  which  was  attended  by  senior  government  officials \n(echelons  1  and  2)  from  MONE,  MORA,  BAPPENAS,  and  MOHA,  the  ESACDP  concept \nreceived full support from all.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND  \n5.  Indonesia has performed impressively since its emergence from the 1997\u20131998 Asian \nfinancial  crisis.  Prudent  macroeconomic  management  has  tamed  inflation,  shrunk  budget \ndeficits, sharply cut the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP), and facilitated a \nhealthy external account. The rehabilitation and consolidation of banks and regulatory reforms \nsince the 1997\u20131998 crisis have buttressed the financial sector. GDP growth has exceeded 5% \nevery quarter since 2005, reaching 6.4% in the third quarter of 2008 before yielding to the \nintensifying global economic crisis. Progressively higher GDP growth pushed up the real GDP \nper capita, improving the average Indonesian's living standards. Relatively successful political \nand  institutional  reforms  sustained  over  the  past  decade  have  created  an  increasingly \ncompetitive  and  decentralized  electoral  democracy.  National,  provincial,  district  and  city \ngovernments are now elected in free contests. A system of checks and balances among the \nlegislative, judicial, and executive branches is increasingly prominent. \n \n6.  The foundation in Indonesia of macroeconomic and political stability established in since \n2000, coupled with the economy's relatively greater reliance on domestic demand, helped \nIndonesia weather the current global economic crisis. The economic slowdown has been more \nmoderate than for many countries. During the period of greatest turbulence in global financial \nmarkets in the fourth quarter of 2008, GDP growth slowed relatively modestly to 5.2%, and the \neconomy still posted healthy growth of 6.1% for the whole of 2008. GDP growth in the first half \nof 2009 decelerated to 4.2% year on year but was stronger than in most other countries in Asia.   \n \n7.   Led by private and government consumption, domestic demand recovered somewhat. \nHouseholds appeared to have recovered confidence, and real incomes were supported by \nmoderating inflation,5 the unconditional cash-transfer program, and, for rural households, a \nstrong harvest. The government response to the worsening global economic environment in \n2009 was quick. Among other measures, the government adopted a more expansionary fiscal \npolicy including a stimulus package equivalent to 1.5% of GDP in 2009. About 77% of the \nstimulus  package  comprised  tax  cuts  for  low-  and  middle-income  workers,  as  well  as  to \nbusinesses, and the rest consisted mainly of spending on labor-intensive infrastructure.6  \n  \n8.  The poverty rate\u2014the proportion of the population living below $1/day\u2014declined to \n14.1%  in  March  2009,  supported  by  stable  rice  and  fuel  prices  and  the  impacts  of  the \nunconditional cash-transfer program implemented in 2008\u20132009. However, this still translates to \n32.5 million people living in poverty and remains above the government's target of a reduction to \n8.2% by 2015. \n \n                                                 \n5   Inflation fell sharply to 2.7% in July 2009 from a peak of 12.1% in September 2008. \n6  These tax cuts on income were in addition to the decreases in corporate and personal income tax under the \namended Income Tax Law, which lowered the top marginal tax rate on personal income from 35% to 30%, reduced \nthe number of income brackets, and increased the minimum threshold for income subject to tax by 20%. It also \nreduced corporate tax to a flat rate of 28% in 2009, to be further lowered to 25% in 2010.  \n ", "  3\nIII.  INDONESIA\u2019S EDUCATION SECTOR  \n9.  Improving the quality of education and access to it is a key priority of the government, as \noutlined in its medium-term development plan, 2005\u20132009 and for 2010\u20132014.7 Accordingly, \neducation's share of public expenditure increased from 12% (Rp42 trillion) in 2001 to 19% \n(Rp209 trillion) in 2009. The education budget is projected to equal at least 20% of national \npublic  expenditure  in  2010.  The  medium-term  budget  framework  of  the  education  sector\u2019s \nstrategic plan projects sustained increases in public education expenditure, rising to Rp279 \ntrillion  by  2014.  Assistance  provided  by  development  partners  to  education  constitutes  an \nindicative 5% of discretionary spending annually.8 \n \n10.  Central education expenditure priorities are generally well aligned with sector policy and \nstrategy  priorities,  with  70%  of  budgetary  provision  for  primary  and  secondary  education \nstrongly  focused  on  ensuring  the  availability  of  quality-oriented  inputs  (e.g.,  instructional \nmaterials and teacher training) and enabling greater autonomy in school-level decision-making, \nas envisaged in the new 2009 education autonomy law.9 Growth in central ministry education \nexpenditure is roughly matched by growth in district education expenditure.  \n \n11.  Since the implementation of decentralization in 2001, district governments have been \nincreasingly responsible for providing public education. Policy, strategy, and standard setting \nare concentrated in the central government, while the 33 provinces are responsible for planning \nand quality assurance and 491 district and city administrations manage the resources and \ndelivery of education.10 The authority to manage basic and secondary education has been fully \ntransferred from the center to provinces and districts. District education expenditure grew rapidly \nfrom Rp26 trillion in 2001 to Rp96 trillion in 2008.11 At the district level, an increasing teacher \nsalary budget frequently captures more than 85% of local government spending on education. \n  \n12.  Formal education is divided into three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The scale \nand structure of Indonesia\u2019s education system reflects the size and cultural traditions of the \ncountry and the importance of Islam, the religion of 90% of the population. With over 55.8 million \nstudents enrolled (including 35.1 million in public schools, 13.3 million in private schools, and \n7.4 million in Islamic schools), and 3.8 million teachers in more than 314,000 schools,12 it is the \nthird-largest education system in Asia and the fourth largest in the world, behind those of the \nPeople's Republic of China, India, and the United States.  \n \n13.  Education, both formal and informal, is characterized by public\u2013private partnerships at \nall levels, with parents and the community supporting informal education, fee-paying senior \nsecondary students, and public grants to universities for research. Informal education is flexible \nin terms of the time and duration of studies, the age of learners, curriculum, delivery modes, and \n                                                 \n7  Government of Indonesia. 2009.

Indonesia Education Statistics in Brief 2007/2008. \nJakarta. \n ", "4   \nassessment  of  learning  achievement.  Informal  education  is  provided  by  governmental  and \nnongovernmental agencies, the private sector, and the community. Although most adults have \nmissed out on secondary education, and some on basic literacy skills, only 1.1 million are \nenrolled  in  informal  and  literacy  education  programs.13 In  international  terms  this  is  a  low \nparticipation rate for informal education. \n \n14.  While  the  education  system  under  MONE  is  decentralized,  MORA  has  maintained \noversight of public Islamic schools. The Islamic subsector delivers basic education through \nmadrasahs  and  pesantrens  (madrasahs  with  boarding  facilities).  Currently  there  are  about \n40,000  madrasahs  in  Indonesia  registered  under  MORA,  of  which  4,000  are  state-owned. \nTogether they accommodate 7 million school-age children. Under the education law, 2003, \nmadrasahs  are  formally  integrated  into  the  national  education  system  following  the  same \ncurriculum and education standards as secular schools. Female participation in Islamic schools \nis high, at more than 50%. Many madrasahs are supported by poorer communities, and most \nparents who send their children to madrasahs are from rural areas and live below the poverty \nline (footnote 13). \n   \n15.  Indonesia has made good progress in providing access to basic education. The net \nenrollment rate in primary education grew from 88.7% in 1990 to 95.1% in 2008. However, there \nare great disparities among provinces and districts mainly because of uneven access to schools \n(e.g., 96% in Central Kalimantan and 78% in Papua). Boys and girls are enrolled in equal \nnumbers at the primary level. At the junior secondary level there are more girls than boys, \nparticularly in urban areas. The gap between rich and poor in education enrollment is much \ngreater than the gap between girls and boys. Net enrollment rates in secondary education have \nexperienced a steady climb, currently standing at 71% in junior secondary and 50% in senior \nsecondary, but are still low compared with those of other countries in the region. Indonesia \ncontinues to trail behind its neighbors, with gross enrollment rates of 35% in early childhood \neducation and 17.5% in higher education.14 \n \n16.  The  quality  of  basic  education  in  Indonesia  is  generally  poor.  Student  examination \nperformance varies widely across districts, and pass rates in poorer, rural, and remote areas are \nwell below average. Indonesia\u2019s performance in international standardized tests has been low \ncompared with those of other Asian countries.  \n \n17.   Major constraints on improving education quality are the lack of qualified teachers in key \nsubjects, inadequate teacher deployment in rural areas, and uneven distribution of teachers \nthroughout the country. There are significant differences in the student\u2013teacher ratio across \ndistricts, indicating a shortage of teachers in rural and remote areas and a serious oversupply of \nteachers in the whole system.15  \n \n18.  Many  Indonesian  teachers  will  retire  soon,  which  presents  a  unique  opportunity  to \nimprove the system in terms of distribution and supply. The government is implementing a \ncountrywide strategy to improve the academic qualifications and certification of teachers and \nhas provided additional budgets for salary increases and other incentives. Further strategies to \nimprove teacher management are required. Strengthening teacher development and optimizing \n                                                 \n13  AusAID. 2007. Indonesia Education Strategy. Jakarta. \n14  World Bank. Education in Indonesia. http://www.worldbank.org/id/education (accessed 20 July 2009). \n15  Indonesia's student\u2013teacher ratio is 14:1, which is the lowest in the region after Japan. However, for primary \nschools, about 75% of districts fall below the overall national average. Such a low student\u2013teacher ratio is a strong \nindicator of systematic inefficiency. Field visits reveal that classes often have more than 30 students, which \nindicates that many teachers are underutilized.  \n ", "  5\nteacher  supply  and  distribution  are  considered  to  have  the  greatest  impact  on  quality \nimprovements in schools. \n \n19.  Government leadership in promoting education sector partnerships and coordination  \namong development partners has improved since 2008, with MONE, MORA, Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), MOHA, BAPPENAS, and the State Ministry for Administration Reform (MENPAN) being \nincreasingly involved in sector performance evaluation, policy dialogue, and Renstra formulation. \nWithin MONE, analytical capacity has advanced through the setting up and strengthening of the \nBoard of National Education Standards, the National Board of Accreditation, and the National \nOffice of Education Research and Development (Balitbang), as well as education management \ninformation systems and examination centers. BAPPENAS has demonstrated strong analytical \ncapacity by facilitating a comprehensive education sector assessment.  \n \n20.  Sector  stakeholder  dialogue  is  becoming  more  comprehensive.  BAPPENAS  has \nformulated  a  preliminary  action  plan  for  government-led  development  partner  coordination \nfollowing the joint signing of the Jakarta Commitment. The preliminary Jakarta Commitment \nroad map sets targets for joint analytical work and coordinated technical assistance. Through \nthe strategic advisory services component of the Basic Education Program, 2006\u20132009, AusAID \nhas provided high-level support to MONE and BAPPENAS for policy research. Responding to \nincreasing responsibilities of local governments in the decentralized context of Indonesia, the \nEU, Government of the Netherlands, and World Bank are providing additional support through \nthe Basic Education Capacity Trust Fund. The trust fund aims to strengthen local governments \nto  improve  basic  education  and  build  up  good  governance  and  efficiency  at  district \nadministrations. The harmonized ESACDP approach, including the joint results framework and \nthe anticipated financial partnership, are viewed within the government as building on and \nextending good practice. \n \nIV.  ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES \n21.  The new medium-term development plan, 2010\u20132014  confirmed that further education \nreform would continue to be a government priority, with an increased emphasis on repositioning \nthe education and training system to enable Indonesia to improve its regional and international \neconomic competitiveness. The two phases of education reform, as set out in the education \nstrategic plans, Renstra 2005\u20132009 and Renstra 2010\u20132014, mirror this vision.   \n \n22.  The reform period 2005\u20132009 focused on \u201cimprovement in capacity and modernization\u201d \nto ensure a better match between supply and demand, reduce service access disparities, and \nmodernize program delivery. The second period, from 2010\u20132014 and focused on \u201cservice \nempowerment,\u201d  is  designed  to  sustain  capacity  improvements  and  strengthen  public \naccountability mechanisms for assuring access and improved quality and standards. \n \n23.  The government\u2019s own sector performance assessment found progress in implementing \nstrategies  to  achieve  Renstra  2005\u20132009  reform  policies  and  targets  has  been  broadly \nsuccessful. This reflects operational improvements in both MONE and MORA. Access in all \nsubsectors has expanded, and performance indicators for education quality and standards (e.g., \nexam scores and schools\u2019 achieving national education standards accreditation) have shown an \nupward trend (footnote 8). Progress has also been made in establishing a comprehensive \nlTehgeis vlaietiwvse  eaxpnrde ssreegdu hlaerteoirny  arfrea tmhoesweo orfk t,h ein ccolunsduinltga nts aenttdin dgo  nuopt  n(ei)c ebsosaarrdilys  reopfr ensaetniot nthaols ee dofu AcaDtBio\u2019sn  \nsmtaenmdbaerrdss,  Baonadrd  o(ifi )D isrecchtooorsl , aMnadn ahgiegmheenr t,e odru sctaaftfi,o ann do mrgaayn bizea ptiroenli maincacrrye dini tnaatitounre .o  ver 2004\u20132006, \nwhich are now operational. \n \n ", "6   \n24.  Further,  the  sector  medium-term  expenditure  framework  is  becoming  more \ncomprehensive,  and  with  this  the  results  orientation  of  central  MONE  and  MORA  budget \nplanning and execution is improving. The new Renstra 2010\u20132014 advances the results focus \nby narrowing priority programs with specified outputs and outcomes. Assistance provided by \ndevelopment partners is fully reflected in annual sector budget plans, which set out priorities \nand contributions from governments, parents, and communities. An action plan for MONE\u2019s \nimplementation  of  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  is  also  advancing.  Program \nperformance indicators, program unit cost standards, and the prioritization of programs are \nbeing  defined,  all as part  of  Renstra  2010\u20132014  formulation.  A  clear  framework  of  senior \nmanagers\u2019 accountability for outcome and output monitoring has also been defined.   \n \n25.  A number of challenges remain, and significant barriers to further reform are evident. \nThe ESSP design mission identified several strategic areas that need to be addressed. In \nparticular, those areas linked to selective legislative and regulatory reform related to basic and \npost-basic education policies and financing, as well as organizational change and development \nplanning in central, provincial, and district agencies, schools, technical and vocational education \nand training (TVET) institutions, and universities. Initial work-planning discussions related to \ninstitutional  reform  have  identified  as  priorities  the  following  areas  for  potential  ESACDP \nassistance: \n(i)  enhancing expenditure-efficiency policies, as envisaged by the public financial \nmanagement (PFM) reforms driven by the Ministry of Finance; \n(ii)  ensuring equitable and effective education financing policy, setting out the roles \nof government agencies at all levels in the sector and defining the roles of the \nprivate sector and communities; \n(iii)  promoting  flexibility  in  budget  decision-making  at  the  center  while  retaining \nbudget discipline and promoting efficiency gains; \n(iv)  articulating, in terms of their technical implementation, regulations on minimum \nservice standards and national education standards as the bases for identifying \ngains in the efficiency of program delivery; \n(v)  rationalizing and regulating the responsibilities of central and local governments \nregarding quality assurance and staff development, including the role of MONE \nprovincial outreach organizations (e.g., provincial education quality assurance \ninstitutions); \n(vi)  defining and regulating areas of shared responsibility between central, provincial, \nand  district  governments,  such  as  senior  secondary  education  staffing  and \nfacilities and aspects of informal education and higher education; and \n(vii)  expanding post-basic education with public\u2013private partnerships for secondary \nand higher education.  \n \n26.  In summary, the ESACDP will, in consultation with internal and external stakeholders, \nidentify capacity needs to achieve ministerial priorities and Renstra targets for regulatory reform. \nRegarding  progress  against  targets,  the  ESACDP  will  work  with  MONE,  MORA,  and \nBAPPENAS  to  support  and  formulate  longer-term  sector  policies  and  strategies  that  are \nresponsive to priority social and economic development requirements.    \n   \n27.  In addition, a number of sector organizational performance challenges in both MONE \nand MORA need to be addressed. For example, district education development plans need a \nstronger results focus. Currently development plans and monitoring systems focus on activities \nand inputs, rather than on sector outcomes. These and other challenges provide opportunity for \nESACDP assistance in, in particular,  \n(i)  accelerating the reduction of disparities among provinces and districts in access \nto  high-quality  basic  education,  while  increasing  the  number  of  high-quality, \n ", "  7\nmotivated,  and  market-oriented  graduates  of  senior  secondary  and  higher \neducation institutions; \n(ii)  sustaining improvements in education quality and standards through a mixture of \nsupply-side approaches (e.g., sustaining growth in school operation budgets and \nensuring  the  equitable  distribution  of  qualified  teachers)  and  demand-side \napproaches  (e.g.,  publishing  exam  results  and  schools'  rankings  in  national \neducation standards);  \n(iii)  sustaining  improvements  in  planning  and  managerial  capacity,  especially  in \ndistricts and schools, as these organizations are granted greater autonomy in line \nwith the new 2009 education legislation and regulations; \n(iv)  influencing improvements in the quality and relevance of post-basic education so \nthat it is equitable, market-responsive, and cost-effective. Post-basic education \nincludes  general  and  senior  secondary  vocational  education,  TVET,  higher \neducation, informal education, and lifelong learning; and \n(v)  sustaining the development of a demand-driven education and training sector by \nmaking education and training institutions more autonomous in planning and \ncustomizing programs and establishing partnerships with experienced national \nand international education trainers.  \n \n28.  In concert with the opportunities mentioned above, there is a prospect for the ESACDP \nto support the establishment of robust processes for building knowledge management and \norganizational learning processes. A priority for the ESACDP will be to initiate dialogue in the \ngovernment, especially in MONE, MORA, MOHA, and local governments, on strengthening the \nsector outcome and results orientation of annual reports (e.g., government agency performance \naccountability reports, district reports) to help promote a shift away from narrower output and \nactivity reporting.   \n \n29.  This initiative would need to be complemented by an analysis of users at various levels, \na review of information systems and related organizational capacity assessments, and the \ndevelopment of more externally oriented communication systems (e.g., with Parliament and civil \nsociety).  Extra  support  is  required  to  help  central  and  district  agencies  better  secure  and \nstreamline sector information and communication flow to internal and external clients, especially \nlegitimizing the use of core data for planning and monitoring.   \n \n30.  The joint and inclusive ADB\u2013AusAID\u2013EU approach will provide a potential vehicle for \ncollaboration with other development partners and a more harmonized approach to external \nassistance. \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  In  line  with  the  ESSP,  the  expected  ESACDP  impact  will  be  to  contribute  to  the \nimplementation of Indonesia's medium-term development policies for poverty reduction, the \nachievement of EFA and education-related MDGs, and improved regional and global economic \ncompetitiveness.  \n \n3T2h.e  viewTsh ee xperxepsescetde hde rEeSinA aCreD tPho soeu tocfo thmee c ownisllu lbtaen tt oan dc odnot rnibout ntee cteos stahreil y greopvreersnemnte tnhto'ss ee offfo ArDtsB \u2019tso  \nsmtreemnbgethrse, nB othaerd e odfu Dciareticotonr ss,y Mstaenmag aenmde nstu, sotra sinta fof,r gaannd imzaatyio bnea lp rpeelirmfoinrmaray ninc en aitmurper.o  vement over the \nnext 15 years by modernizing the system, improving service empowerment, and enabling better \nregional and international competitiveness. The purpose is to promote policy dialogue and the \ninstitutional  and  organizational  reform  that  underpin  policy  implementation  and  reduce \n ", "8   \ndisparities  in  provincial  and  district  education  performance.  The  ESACDP  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  monitoring  progress  toward  the  achievement  of  Renstra  targets  and  the \nobjectives of the ESSP results framework. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n33.  The ESACDP will have three outputs: \n(i)  Operational research papers and proposals for selective legislative and \nregulatory reforms related to basic and post-basic education policies and \nfinancing.  This  output  is  designed  to  improve  sector  responsiveness  by \nproviding the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for guiding and \ninfluencing  the  performance  of  sector  organizations.  The  focus  will  be  on \neffecting  decentralization  and  rationalizing  and  articulating  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  central  and  local  governments.  Based  on  initial  work-\nplanning discussions, priority activities may include \n(a)  consultations with MONE, MORA, BAPPENAS, and external stakeholders \nto  assess  regulatory  reform  needs  related  to  Renstra  targets  and \norganizing  workshops and strategic seminars on the recommendations; \n(b)  assessment  of  the  current  PFM  mechanisms  in  education  and \ndevelopment of recommendations and training programs to strengthen \nPFM  at  the  center  and  in  provinces,  districts  and  schools,  including \nregular assessment of progress in decentralized PFM; \n(c)  draft policy recommendations defining the sector roles of government at \nall levels, including significant interactions to involve the private sector \nand communities; and \n(d)  analysis of institutional, organizational, and financing options to improve \nthe market responsiveness of vocational education and training, higher \neducation, informal education, and adult learning, as well as sector policy \nanalysis to develop options for public\u2013private partnerships in post-basic \neducation, including economic analysis of higher education offerings and \nalignment with labor market needs. \n (ii)   Operational  research  papers  and  proposals  for  selective  organizational \nchange  and  development  in  central,  provincial,  and  district  agencies, \nschools,  TVET  institutions,  and  universities.  This  output  is  designed  to \nfacilitate  the  organizational  development  planning  necessary  for  sustainable \nsector capacity building with a focus on relevance and quality of education, \nincluding post-basic education, TVET, higher education, informal education, adult \neducation,  and  lifelong  learning.  During  initial  work  planning,  a  number  of \npossible activities to achieve this output were discussed, including supporting \ncapacity to \n(a)  assess  priorities  for  organizational  reform  planning  in  those  agencies \nresponsible for designing institutional reform and monitoring compliance \nand safeguarding (e.g., audit agencies); \n(b)  assess  consistency  between  assigned  obligations  and  functions  and \nactual operational arrangements under decentralization and help plan any \norganizational  adjustments  (e.g.,  between  the  central  MONE,  district \nadministrations, and schools); \n(c)  ensure that program expenditure allocation fully aligns with organizational \npriorities and assist with capacity development planning; \n(d)  strengthen capacity for curriculum development, in particular developing \ncreative teaching models designed to strengthen the teaching\u2013learning \nprocess;  \n ", "  9\n(e)  assist in reforming assessment systems at all levels, developing school \nassessment  systems,  strengthening  PFM  in  schools  and  districts, \nimproving  accreditation  systems  for  schools  and  madrasahs,  and \nconducting district education PFM assessments; and \n(f)  strengthen  the  quality  and  relevance  of  TVET,  higher  education  and \nreform accreditation and assessment systems. \n(iii)   Improved  information  and  communication  systems  as  part  of  effective \nESACDP  implementation.  This  output  is  designed  to  establish  and  sustain \nrobust  processes  for  building  knowledge  management  and  organizational \nlearning processes. During initial work planning, a number of possible activities to \nachieve this output were discussed: \n(a)  clarify  organizational  development  requirements  for  setting  up  an \nintegrated outcome- and output-based management information system \nto  support,  for  example,  MONE\u2019s  new  roles  and  functions,  including \nregulatory and quality assurance functions;  \n(b)  undertake  an  analysis  of  stakeholders;  review  current  information \nsystems and information needs; and review related capacity, especially \nregarding  current  mandates,  staffing  skill  mix,  and  externally  oriented \ncommunication systems;   \n(c)  develop an action plan for strengthening internal and external processes \nfor knowledge management and information systems (e.g., strengthening \nthe education management information system); and \n(d)  formulate  an  action  plan  to  establish  network  and  knowledge \nmanagement combining the center, provinces, districts, and schools to \nshare, for example, examination results and approaches to improving \nstudent performance and teacher development. \n \n34.  The ESACDP will have a comprehensive public communication strategy for Renstra \n2010\u20132014 implementation. This will include posting progress reports on sector performance \nand publishing regular progress reports on Renstra targets and information on program work \nplans and budgets. In addition, planning will be undertaken to improve the visibility of this \ninnovative  ADB\u2013AusAID\u2013EU\u2013Government  of  Indonesia  partnership  by,  for  example, \nrecognizing donor contributions by incorporating their logos on materials developed for training, \nconferences, and publications. Visibility activities contracted separately by the EU and AusAID \nwill be coordinated with those implemented under the ESACDP. \n \n35.  Scope. The ESACDP approach assumes that assistance will be limited to supporting \norganizational change and planning capacity development. This will include research and study \nto assess institutional challenges to reform, including PFM capacity, and identify needs, options, \nand recommendations for organizational change. Workshops and conferences will consider \nstrategy options, and study tours and twinning arrangements will enable the consideration of \nregional expertise for benchmarking and benefiting from lessons learned. The ESACDP will \nassist in developing training plans and modules designed to meet challenges identified in the \nresearch and studies. While the ESACDP will support capacity development planning and the \npreparation of strategy options for organizational reforms, the responsibility for financing and \nimplementing capacity development shall rest with the government at the various levels.   \n \n3T6h.e  viewGso evxeprrnesasnecde h earrerian nagree mthoesnet so.f  tTheh ec oensxuelctauntitn agn da dgoe nncoyt  noefc etshsea riElyS rAepCreDsPe nits t htohsee  oNf aAtiDoBn\u2019asl  \nOmfefimceb efrosr,  BRoeasred aorfc Dhi raenctdo rDs,e Mvaenloapgmemenent t(, Boar lsittbafaf,n agn) do mf aMyO bNe Epr.e Tlimhein aEryS AinC nDatPur ete. c hnical oversight \ngroup (ATOG) will be established in Balitbang. The ATOG will be cochaired by the deputy \nminister of human resources and culture in BAPPENAS, the head of Balitbang, and MORA \n ", "10  \ndirector general of Islamic education. The Balitbang secretariat will act as the secretariat of the \nATOG.   \n \n37.   ATOG  membership  may  include  senior  officials  (echelon  II)  from  MONE,  MORA, \nBAPPENAS, MOF, MOHA,  AusAID and the EU.  Ministries (i.e., MOHA, BAPPENAS, and MOF) \nand groups such as the thematic education dialogue group16 and the education sector working \ngroup17 will  be  associated  as  relevant  to  ESACDP  activities  and  in  some  instances  be \nbeneficiary organizations for ESACDP funding, in accordance with their mandates. The ATOG \nis expected to meet quarterly in January, April, July, and September. It will be responsible for \norganizing regular technical dialogue with ADB, AusAID, and EU technical and advisory staff, \nincluding joint planning of the annual work plan and performance review. \n \n38.  The ATOG will approve annual ESACDP work plans by consensus. Annual workplans \nwill define individual activities and specific technical cooperation requirements18. Annual work \nplans will be extensively informed by macro-PFM, fiscal decentralization, and audit system \ndevelopments  to  ensure  complementarity,  and  priorities  of  programs  financed  by  other \ndevelopment  partners.  To  ensure  national  ownership  and  help  prioritization,  the  ESACDP \nannual work program will be formulated through dialogue with all key stakeholders in an iterative \nprocess  of  consultations  and  workshops.  The  finalized  ESACDP  annual  work  plan  will  be \npresented and discussed in a workshop for senior national stakeholders. \n  \n39.  This broad-based ESACDP governance structure will ensure that lessons from program \nimplementation, including from related analytical and capacity development programs (e.g., \nADB\u2013United Nations Children\u2019s Fund [UNICEF] Basic Education Sector Support Program, EU\u2013\nNetherlands\u2013World  Bank  Basic  Education  Capacity  Trust  Fund,  AusAID  Basic  Education \nProgram,  and  Contractor  Strategic  Advisory  Services),  as  well  as  lessons  from  the \nimplementation of Renstra 2010\u20132014, feed into work plans and priorities. In consecutive years \nthe formation of the annual work plan will continue to be iterative, flexible in approach, and \ninformed by performance monitoring and lessons from the findings of the various progress \nreports.19 The plan will be reviewed and approved by the ATOG.  \n \n40.  The participation of a wide range of stakeholders and development partners in the \nATOG will contribute by promoting aid effectiveness in support of the Jakarta Commitment \nagenda,  particularly  related  to  (i)  improving  governance  and  strengthening  capacity  in \ngovernment  systems,  (ii)  building  effective  and  inclusive  partnerships  and  expanding \ndevelopment dialogue, and (iii) strengthening the focus on development results. The ESACDP \nwill help to develop operational indicators and subsequently monitor progress toward achieving \nthe goals of the Jakarta Commitment and the Paris/Accra declaration on aid effectiveness in \neducation.  \n \n41.  The proposed ESACDP arrangements draw on the experiences and lessons from other \ndevelopment partners20 and EU21 studies and policies, which indicate that technical cooperation \nfor capacity development is more effective when government-led and embedded in government \norganizational  change  and  learning  processes,  and  when  technical  cooperation  is \n                                                 \n16  Led by BAPPENAS, with joint support from AusAID, EU, Netherlands, and World Bank. \n17  Includes members from all development partners involved in education to promote improved coordination in line \nwith the Jakarta Commitment. \n18  In the first month after the TA will become effective, a \"Manual of Procedures\" providing detailed operational \nguidelines and defining approval processes will be prepared by ADB in concurrence with BAPPENAS, MONE, \nMORA, AusAID and the EU.     \n19  Regular medium-term development plans and Renstra progress reports. \n20  JICA et al. 2008.

Rationale  for  ESACDP  alignment  with  MONE\u2019s  National  Office  of  Education \nResearch  and  Development  Office.  The  ESACDP  design  is  aligned  with  MONE\u2019s  and \nMORA\u2019s own research and development plans. Located in and working through Balitbang, the \nESACDP will provide complementary support and facilitate knowledge management to serve \nthe research and planning needs of the broader education community, including internal and \nexternal stakeholders.   \n \n43.  At present, MONE\u2019s Balitbang is the focal point of knowledge management for the \nsector.  It  is  shaped  by  purpose-driven  centers  for  (i)  educational  policy,  research,  and \ninnovation; (ii) curriculum; (iii) education assessment; and (iv) educational statistics, as well as a \nsecretariat. These units work collectively to improve sector performance assessment in line with \nRenstra  forward  planning.  The  organization  structure  of  MONE  is  in  Appendix  4  and  of \nBalitbang in Appendix 5. \n \n44.  The shared focus of the centers for education assessment; educational policy, research, \nand  innovation;  and  curriculum  includes  (i)  education  policy  and  innovation  research;  (ii) \ndeveloping educational testing and assessment systems; (iii) organizing the management and \nthe processing of test results; (iv) implementing education quality monitoring; (v) studying local, \nregional, national, and international curriculum and subject policy; (vi) developing innovative \ncurriculum models; and (vii) developing learning facility and infrastructure models.   \n \n45.  The center for educational policy, research, and innovation researches issues that have \nthe highest financial impact and the most relevance to the government\u2019s core education policy. \nUnder its mandate for innovation, the center established a national mechanism for sharing and \nreusing education results and research.22 Although this network is still being pioneered, some \nearly success is evident, as 30 provinces and 162 districts have registered with the network and \nreceived training on how to manage policy research and analysis. This encouraging initiative will \ngive additional support to the ESACDP as it seeks to identify and respond to the priority needs \nof provinces and districts.  \n \n46.  Balitbang\u2019s education statistics center strengthens information systems and improves \nclient consultation and accountability mechanisms by (i) improving education data collection and \nstatistics,  (ii)  strengthening  the  development  of  education  data  collection  institutions  and \nsystems,  (iii)  improving  human  resources  on  data  management;  (iv)  expanding  the \ndissemination of information related to education decision making; (v) improving the regulation \nand control of education service quality and results; (vi) further developing national regulations \nand standards for education; (vii) improving the management and organization of monitoring \nand accountability systems; and (viii) developing educational data and their utilization in policies \nto strengthen midterm and long-term planning, e.g., the Indonesia Education Assessment to \n2025. \n \n47.   In  addition,  Balitbang\u2019s  forward  research  and  development  work  plans  are  being \nformulated for related work under a number of programs assisted by development partners, \nincluding (i) the next phase of education sector assessment led by BAPPENAS; (ii) capacity \naTshsee vsisemwse nextsp raenssde dp ihloetreedin  caarpe athcoitsye b olof tchke  gcroannstusl tafonrt  adnisdt rdicot sn,o te nsepceecsiasallryil yfo rre perxepseenntd tihtuorsee  pofla AnDnBin\u2019sg  \namnedm mbearns,a Bgoeamrde notf;  D(iiriie) ctthoers ,n Mexatn pagheamsee not,f  oarn satalyfsf,i sa nodf  mthaey  ubsee p roefl immiinnaimryu inm n saeturrveic. e  standards; and \n(iv)  analysis  specific  to  sector  performance,  financial  performance,  and  district  education \n                                                 \n22  Government of Indonesia, Ministry of National Education.

MORA has its own Office of Research Development and Training (Badan Litbang dan \nDiklat), which is responsible for data and information preparation as well as policy drafts. \nHowever, it has limited operational capacity, with two centers dedicated respectively to (i) \nconducting research and (ii) training and education in religious affairs based on the policy set by \nthe minister. MORA\u2019s research and development organizational responsibilities and structure \nare in Appendix 6.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n49.  The ESACDP is estimated to cost $55.0 million, of which about $27.0 million will be a \ngrant from the EU and about $23.0 million will be a grant from the Government of Australia, both \nto be administered by ADB.24 The Government of Indonesia will contribute $5.0 million in kind \nfor office space, transport, workshop facilitation, and remuneration and per diem for counterpart \nstaff. ADB's indicative lending program for 2010\u20132012 includes the Polytechnics Development \nProject in 2011 for $100 million and the Higher Education Project in 2012 for $130 million. To \nsupport both project designs, grant funds of $2.2 million have been earmarked for two project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) projects to conduct comprehensive assessments of the \nrespective subsectors. Contributing to the ESACDP and in line with the Jakarta Commitment to \nbuild more effective and inclusive partnerships for development, the diagnostic sector work \nunder these project preparatory TA projects will be integrated in the annual ESACDP work plans \nand carried out in close collaboration with AusAID, the EU, and the Government of Indonesia to \nensure that project designs are aligned with Renstra priorities and linked to the ESSP. Scope for \nadditional contribution to the ESACDP from development partners will be investigated during \nproject implementation. \n \n50.  The main financing components of the ESACDP are (i) technical assistance for the \nESACDP operational management team and operations ($2.6 million); (ii) technical assistance \nfor  the  ESACDP  core  advisory  team  ($2.1  million);  and  (iii)  various  forms  of  technical \ncooperation for the implementation of the ESACDP work plan ($41.3 million). The specific work \nplan allocations under the three outputs and annual budget plans will be determined in the \ninception phase and subsequently form the basis for the annual work plan and budget. The \nESACDP cost estimate and financing plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n51.  The costs of independent AusAID and EU external midterm reviews and evaluation \nservices and of any audit missions and the subsequent formulation and design activities for \nfurther phases of AusAID and EU support will be funded separately from the ESACDP budget. \n \n52.  EU procurement guidelines forbid discrimination in procurement when engaging legal \npersons and firms, and procuring goods and services, from persons and entities established in \nEU-recognized  official  countries,  member  states  of  the  EU,  and  developing  countries  as \nspecified by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development.25 As the TA is cofinanced by the EU, ADB Management will \n                                                 \n23  The  AusAID  Basic  Education  Program  has  produced  and  updated  valuable  reports,  such  as  the  financial \nperformance report (2008) and district financial reporting in education (2009). \n24  The EU will contribute Euro20.0 million; the Australian Government will contribute AUS$25.0 million. Amounts \ninclude ADB's administration fee, audit cost, bank charges, to the extent that these items are not covered by the \ninterest and investment income earned on these grants, or any additional grant contribution by the Government of \nAustralia and the EU. \n25  Regulation (EU) No. 2110/2005 of the European Council and Parliament, 14 December 2005. \n ", "  13\nrequest Board approval to allow the procurement of eligible goods and services from countries \neligible to supply them under EU regulations that are not ADB members. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n53.  The ESACDP will be implemented over 5 years, commencing in June 2010 and ending \nin May 2015, subject to AusAID, EU, and government finalization of ESSP governance and \noperational arrangements and the endorsement of contractual agreements between AusAID, \nEU, and the government. The inception phase will include a transition plan from the existing \nstrategic advisory services component of the AusAID Basic Education Program. Transition \narrangements will ensure continuity in established relationships and networks, the transfer of \ndata and knowledge, and continuity of effort through opportunities to align ESACDP work plans \nwith ongoing activity supported by strategic advisory services.  \n \n54.  ADB will be responsible for managing and administering the program collaboratively with \nAusAID, EU, and the Government of Indonesia. ADB will ensure that the program inputs are \nmanaged effectively and efficiently and will support the government\u2019s efforts to enable the \nprogram output and outcomes to be achieved. Disbursements under the TA will be done in \naccordance with the ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.26  \n \n55.  Balitbang will be the executing agency for the ESACDP. The head of Balitbang, as \nprogram  director,  will  appoint  an  ESACDP  program  manager  from  within  Balitbang.  The \nESACDP program manager will be responsible for (i) program work planning, the formulation of \nESACDP annual work plans, and facilitating their approval by the ATOG; (ii) setting up technical \nand financial management, reporting, and accounting systems; (iii) annual budget planning and \nresource allocations; (iv) facilitating the identification of international and national consulting \nservices or other forms of technical cooperation (e.g., institutional twinning, study tours); (v) \npreparing the required progress reports; (vi) organizing and executing the internal midterm \nreview  and  final  evaluation;  (vii)  organizing  any  agreed  government  and  donor  visibility \nrequirements; and (viii) ensuring regular liaison with development partners, particularly ADB, \nAusAID,  and  the  EU.  Annual  work  plans  will  be  formulated  in  cooperation  with  all  key \nstakeholders through an iterative process of consultations and workshops.   \n \n56.  To support the ESACDP program manager\u2019s implementation of annual work plans and \nensure the achievement of expected outputs, the ESACDP will provide $2.6 million in TA for \noperational  management.  A  team  will  be  recruited  to  provide  administrative  and  support \nservices. About 300 person-months of international and national consulting services will be \nrequired, comprising an international ESACDP operational management specialist (about 60 \nperson-months), national operation managers for procurement (about 120 person-months), and \nnational administration and finance managers (about 120 person-months). Indicative terms of \nreference for the ESACDP operational management team are in Appendix 9.   \n \n57.  In addition to assistance for operational management, the ESACDP will provide $2.1 \nmillion in TA for a core advisory team27 to support the ESACDP program director and manager \nin preparing and subsequently implementing ESACDP annual work plans. The core advisory \nteam  will  help  the  executing  agency  with  (i)  formulating  ESACDP  technical  cooperation \nrequirements, including specifying and drafting terms of reference; (ii) assuring the quality and \nmThoen ivtioerwinsg e xtphrees speedr hfoerrmeina nacree  thoofs et eocf hthnei ccaoln scuoltoapnte arantdio dno  nporto nveidceesds aurinlyd reerp rethseen t EthSoAseC oDfP A;D  B(i\u2019isi)  \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n26  ADB. 2008.

The  ESACDP  operational  management  team  and  the  core  advisory  team  will  be \nrecruited individually and/or through firms in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time), with procurement eligibility expanded to \ninclude those countries eligible for procurement under the EU regulations which are non-ADB \nmember countries, and in consultation with ADB, AusAID, and the Government of Indonesia. \n \n59.  The ESACDP will provide $41.3 million over 5 years for various forms of technical \ncooperation to help the government implement the ESACDP with MONE\u2019s parallel financing of \nthe program, as defined in MONE directorates and Balitbang annual work plans and budgets.28 \nThe  forms  of  technical  cooperation  will  be  defined  in  annual  work  plans  and  include  (i) \nsupporting  legislative  and  regulatory  reforms  through  research  studies,  study  tours,  work \nattachments, and institutional links related to building government capacity to formulate and \nimplement  revised  sector  policy,  strategy,  financing,  and  associated  regulatory  and \norganizational compliance; (ii) supporting capacity development at the center and in districts \nthrough  central,  provincial,  and  district  capacity  assessments,  guidelines  for  organizational \nreform planning, and support for organizational PFM, audit assessments, forward planning, \npreparation of training programs; and (iii) support to improve information and communication \nsystems  through  research,  study  tours,  work attachments,  and institutional links  related  to \nbuilding up organizational knowledge and learning as a  basis for internally driven change.   \n \n60.  The  services  for  implementing  the  annual  ESACDP  work  plan,  including  facilitating \nresearch, surveys, study tours, staff exchanges, twinning arrangements, conferences, seminars, \nand the provision of specialists for defined short-term assignments, will be procured through \n(i) ADB indefinite delivery contracts (IDCs)29 and (ii) individually recruited consultants to be \nagreed upon in the annual work plan. At least three IDC consortia, drawing on international, \nregional,  and  national sources  and  mechanisms,  will  be  pre-qualified  and  retained  on call \ninitially for 2.5 years, with extension of IDC qualification subject to the ESACDP midterm review. \nRecruitment shall be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, with \nprocurement eligibility expanded to include those countries eligible for procurement under the \nEU regulations which are non-ADB member countries. The IDC approach is consistent with \nsimilar AusAID and EU on-call procurement arrangements30 and is outlined in Appendix 11. \n \n61.  The IDC process for procuring ESACDP technical cooperation services, amounting to \n$41.3 million, will be as follows. Based on the annual work plan, the ESACDP program manager \nwill, with the help of the core advisory team, draft specific terms of reference and specifications \nfor each assignment. These terms of reference will be forwarded to ADB, EU and AusAID for \nreview and action. The ESACDP operational management specialist will circulate terms of \nreference to the pre-qualified ESACDP consortium groups selected under the IDC arrangement. \nEach ESACDP consortium will be required to submit a proposal to ADB within 30 days of \nreceipt of terms of reference. The ESACDP operational management specialist will support \n                                                 \n28  The proposed Balitbang budget for 2010 is Rp1.04 trillion. \n29  IDCs are used to have on call specialized services to provide advices for a particular activity, the extent and timing \nof which cannot be defined in advance. This is commonly used to retain advisers for implementing complex \nprojects, institutional reforms, procurement advice, etc. Unit rates to be paid for the services and experts are \nagreed in advance, and payments are made on the basis of the time actually used. \n30  For example, the EU framework contract and AusAID period offer contract arrangements. \n ", "  15\nADB\u2019s conduct of an evaluation of the consortium proposals within 7 days of receipt. Within a \nfurther 7 days, the ESACDP operational management specialist will meet with the ESACDP \nprogram manager to discuss evaluation ranking and obtain a formal no-objection letter from the \nESACDP program director for ADB\u2019s recommended choice or an agreed alternative. The ADB \nIndonesia  Resident  Mission  will  then  proceed  with  formal  recruitment.  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) will be applicable throughout implementation, \nwith the expansion of procurement eligibility as noted above. Acquired assets funded under the \nproject will be handed over to the executing agency upon project completion.      \n \n62.  Financing  arrangements.  The  EU  will  contribute  Euro20.0  million;  the  Australian \nGovernment will contribute AUS$25.0 million31. The contribution of the Australian Government \nwill be converted into Euro at the exchange rate prevailing on the same day of the transfer. \nFunds from both financiers will be pooled into one account. All contracts concluded under the \nTA will be denominated in Euro. Financing of activities will not distinguish between EU and \nAustralian contribution, but the amount from each contribution will be recorded in the project \naccounts. ADB will provide annual financial reports to the donors in Euro.     \n \n63.  Reporting. The ESACDP program director and program manager, assisted by the core \nadvisory team, will prepare an inception report including a work plan for 2010. The inception \nreport will to be submitted to the ATOG at the end of the first 3 months for approval. The work \nplan and budget will be reviewed and approved in conjunction with ADB.   \n \n64.  In addition to the inception report, the executing agency, supported by the core advisory \nteam and ADB, will prepare the following reports to be submitted through the ATOG: (i) six \nmonthly technical progress and financial reports; (ii) successive annual work plans and budgets \nfor the calendar years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and the first half of 2015; and (iii) a completion \nreport at the end of the TA indicating achievement toward agreed outputs and outcomes  and \nincorporating lessons and recommendations for any follow up.  \n \n65.  External  monitoring.    Independently  financed  by  the  EU,  an  external  review  of \nESACDP progress is expected to take place in the second half of 2011. A further external \nevaluation is expected to take place in the second half of 2012 or beginning of 2013 and will \nserve as a midterm review.

Overview  \n1.  Since commencing government decentralization in 2001, Indonesia\u2019s education sector \nhas received $2.1 billion in external assistance from multilateral and bilateral agencies.1 These \ndevelopment partners continue to provide assistance amounting to an estimated 2% of public \neducation expenditure (Rp209 trillion in 2009) and 5%\u20136% of discretionary spending.  \n2.  Primary and secondary education has received the largest share ($1.2 billion), with \nnational and provincial development spending focused on achieving the goals and targets of \neducation for all by, for example, improving school infrastructure and providing scholarships and \ntextbooks. More recent assistance in 2005\u20132009 has been in line with education reform as set \nout in the education strategic plan,\u00a0 Renstra. The thrust of this 5-year period has been the \nimplementation of projects and programs designed to maintain the focus on achieving goals and \ntargets through support for formal basic education and improved access and equity, quality \nstandards, and governance and accountability. \n 3.  Table A3 indicates that some agencies/development partners have extended their efforts \nto include the management of several projects and programs operating at different levels in the \nsector. Others have contributed to capacity building at only one level in the sector, e.g., USAID \nDecentralized Basic Education project (1, 2, 3). \nTable A3: Major External Assistance to the Education Sector Extending Beyond 2009 \nFunding \nProject or Program Title  Project or Program Focus  body  Calendar \nDecentralized Basic  Strengthen the quality of basic education in 100 of the  USAID  2005\u20132010 \nEducation (1, 2, 3)  country\u2019s approximately 509 districts over 5 years, \nAustralia\u2013Indonesia  Improve equitable access to higher-quality and better- AusAID  2006\u20132010 \nBasic Education Program   governed basic education, including constructing over 1,500 \npublic schools and 500 Islamic schools by the end of 2009. \nBasic Education Sector  Mapping and mainstreaming local good practice.

For various reasons, some to do with the Government of Indonesia and/or development \npartners decision-making (e.g., the opportunity through Better Education through Reformed \nManagement and Universal Teacher Upgrading (BERMUTU) to model teacher upgrading), a \ncoordinated approach to systemic capacity development of any nature2 in the sector has been \nlacking. Approved external assistance beyond 2009 is designed to maintain focus on early \nchildhood development, school-based management, teacher training, and the expansion of \nemployment opportunities for senior secondary vocational graduates.  \n5.  Since July 2008 the government\u2019s leadership and approach to promoting education \nsector partnership and donor coordination has improved. The Ministry of National Education, \nMinistry  of  Religious  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency, and State Ministry for Administration Reform are increasingly \ninvolved in sector performance evaluation, policy dialogue and Renstra formulation. As a result, \nprogrammed strategic assistance is progressively moving toward supporting the government\u2019s \nanalysis of critical policy issues and developing new policy to support the service empowerment \nphase of reform. This phase is designed to sustain capacity improvements and strengthen \npublic accountability mechanisms for assuring access and improved quality and standards. \n6.  The government's medium-term development plan, 2010\u20132014 confirmed that further \neducation reform will continue to be a priority, with an increased emphasis on repositioning the \neducation  and  training  system  to  improve  Indonesia's  regional  and  international  economic \ncompetitiveness.  \n7.  The Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership\u2019s (ESACDP) program strategy is \ndesigned to work within the Government of Indonesia to support these priorities. The ESACDP \nwill help inform the policy dialogue and institutional and organizational reform to underpin policy \nimplementation,  as  well  as  help  reduce  disparities  in  provincial  and  district  education \nperformance. It will support and formulate longer-term sector policies and strategies that are \nresponsive  to  priority  social  and  economic  development  requirements.  For  example,  it  is \nproposed that the ESACDP build on the work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2013European \nUnion (EU) Basic Education Sector Capacity Support Program (BE-SCSP) with an analysis to \narticulate  the  regulations  related  to  minimum  service  standards  and  national  education \nstandards. This should provide a baseline for identifying gains in program delivery efficiency. \n \n \n                                                 \n2 Capacity development involves human resources and institutional development and infrastructure. \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nB.  Harmonization of Analytical Support for Education  \n8.  The ESACDP will provide support to the government far in excess of other development \npartners analytical support envisaged for 2010\u20132015. The purpose and scope of the ESACDP \nhas  been  agreed  with  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  and  its  operational  structure  and \nimplementation will be located within the government.  The design of the ESACDP took into \nconsideration  the  existence  of  several  analytical  support  programs  of  other  development \npartners that are already operational and future support under consideration by others.  \n9.  To ensure harmonization, the ESACDP partners agree that the following principles will \nguide ESACDP implementation: (i) Additional development partners may join the partnership \nthrough joint financing or parallel financing arrangements, and their areas of analytical priority \nwill be considered by the ESACDP technical oversight group in expanding the scope of the \nESACDP.  (ii)  Other  development  partners  may  provide  bilateral  analytical  support \ncomplementary to the ESACDP and its technical oversight group, and ESACDP operational \nmanagement  and  core  team  will  cooperate  to  ensure  harmonization  of  effort  in  areas  of \nconvergence. (iii) The ESACDP will consult intensively with existing operations such as the \nBasic Education Capacity Trust Fund and the Dutch Basic Education Trust Fund to ensure \ncomplementarity of effort and possible shared effort around selected areas of their mutual \nmandate,  (iv)  Knowledge  sharing  procedures  may  be  established  through  government-\norganized dialogue among analytical support providers, both current and future, including joint \nad hoc working groups on specific priority areas that more than one provider is contributing to. \n10.  These principles build on past practices of collaboration and joint effort such as between \n(i) the EU- and Netherlands-financed, World Bank-managed and AusAID-financed analytical \nservices in 2009 to support the preparation of the medium-term development plan for education \nand  (ii)  the  EU\u2013ADB  Minimum  Service  Standards  Technical  Assistance  and  the  EU\u2013\nNetherlands\u2013World Bank Basic Education Capacity Trust Fund in district capacity assessments. \n11.  During  ADCP  preparation  there  were  expressions  of  interest  from  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and the World Bank in working jointly with the proposed \nESACDP  in  such  areas  as  the  accreditation  of  vocational  and  informal  institutions  and \nresponding  to  the  evolving  agenda  of  the  Thematic  Education  Dialogue, 3  and  other \ndevelopment partners such as the United States Agency for International Development and the \nNew Zealand Agency for International Development indicated that they would consider the \nESACDP option in their design processes. \n12.  A broadly representative and effective organizational arrangement for dialogue is active \nin the form of the education sector working group, whose operation is guided by a set of \npartnership  principles  revised  in  early  2009.  The  working  group  has  evolved  from  an \ninformation-sharing group to one that more systemically advocates improved harmonization and \nalignment as agreed in the Jakarta Commitment. There have been significant efforts since 2006 \nto better harmonize approaches to external assistance through various forms of ADB, AusAID, \nEU, Netherlands, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and World Bank cooperation.4  \n                                                 \n3  Led by the National Development Planning Agency, with joint support from AusAID, EU, Netherlands, and World \nBank. \n4  Noteworthy examples include (i) the ADB\u2013EU and EU\u2013UNICEF BESCSP analysis and piloting for capacity \ndevelopment;

Based on the annual work plans, the core advisory team will help the executing \nagency to prepare progress reports, as described above.  \n ", "  Appendix 11  41 \nTECHNICAL COOPERATION PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS \n \nA.   Scope and Coverage of Technical Cooperation Services \n \n1.  Under the ESACDP, it is anticipated that the outcome and outputs will be achieved by \neffectively  using  different  forms  of  technical  cooperation,  including  consultants,  research, \ninstitutional twinning, study tours, work attachments, and international and regional benchmarking. \nIn  addition,  technical  cooperation  will  focus  on  building  networks  for  information  sharing, \ncommunication, and knowledge management in Indonesia, the Ministry of National Education \n(MONE), and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) on key education sector policies, strategies, \nand implementation modalities. \n \n2.  In terms of a first set of activities, the ESACDP will support a number of analytical and \noperational research papers and proposals for selected legislative and regulatory reforms related \nto basic and post-basic education policies and financing. This output is designed to improve sector \nresponsiveness by providing the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for guiding and \ninfluencing the performance of sector organizations. The focus will be on effecting decentralization \nand rationalizing and articulating the implementation roles and responsibility of the central and \nlocal governments.  \n \n3.  Based on initial work planning discussions, priority activities may include (i) consultations \nwith MONE and MORA and external stakeholders to assess regulatory reform needs related to \neducation strategic plan, or Renstra, targets; organizing workshops and strategic seminars to \nsocialize  recommendations;  (ii) assessment  of  current  public  financial  management  (PFM) \nmechanisms in education and the development of recommendations to strengthen PFM at the \ncenter and in provinces, districts, and schools; and (iii) analysis of institutional, organizational, and \nfinancing options to improve the market responsiveness of vocational education and training, \nhigher education, informal education, and adult learning, as well as sector policy analysis, for \ndeveloping options for public\u2013private partnerships in post-basic education, including economic \nanalysis of higher education offerings and alignment with labor market needs. \n \n4.  In terms of a second set of activities, the ESACDP will support activities for selective \norganizational  change  and  development  in  central,  provincial,  and  district  agencies,  schools, \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions, and universities. This output is \ndesigned to facilitate the organizational development planning necessary for sustainable sector \ncapacity building with a particular focus on the relevance and quality of education, including post-\nbasic education, TVET, informal education, adult education, and lifelong learning.  \n \n5.  During initial work planning, a number of possible activities to achieve this output were \ndiscussed, including supporting capacity to (i) assess priorities for organizational reform planning in \nthose  agencies  responsible  for  designing  institutional  reform  and  monitoring  compliance  and \nsafeguarding (e.g., audit agencies); (ii) assess consistency between assigned obligations and \nfunctions  and  actual  operational  arrangements  under  decentralization  and  help  plan  any \norganizational adjustments; and (iii) assess whether critical capacity is established in MONE and \nMORA, local education authorities, and frontline service units to ensure that program expenditure \nallocation  is  fully  aligned  with  organizational  priorities  and  assist  with  capacity  development \nplanning; and (iv) strengthen capacity for curriculum development, in particular developing creative \nteaching models, strengthening the teaching\u2013learning process, reforming assessment systems in \nprovinces, developing school assessment systems, improving PFM in schools and districts, and \nimproving accreditation systems for schools and madrasahs. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 11 \n \n6.  In terms of a third set of activities, the ESACDP will support activities related to improved \ninformation and communication systems. This output is designed to establish and sustain robust \nprocesses for building knowledge management and organizational learning processes. During \ninitial work planning a number of possible activities to achieve this output were discussed: (i) clarify \norganizational development requirements for setting up an integrated outcome- and output-based \nmanagement information system; (ii) undertake an analysis of stakeholders at various levels, \nreview current information systems and information needs, and review related capacity especially \nregarding current mandates, staffing skills mix, and externally oriented communication systems; (iii) \ndevelop  an  action  plan  for  strengthening  internal  and  external  processes  for  knowledge \nmanagement and information systems (e.g., strengthening the Education Management Information \nSystem (EMIS); and (iv) formulate an action plan to establish network and knowledge management \nat the center and in provinces, districts, and schools, e.g., to share examination results and \napproaches for improving student performance and teacher development. \n \n7.  The ESACDP will include a comprehensive public communication strategy for Renstra \n2010\u20132014 implementation. This will include posting sector performance progress reports and \npublishing regular progress reports on Renstra targets and information on relevant program work \nplans and budgets.   \n \nB.  Procurement Arrangements \n \n8.  Most technical cooperation services for implementing the annual ESACDP work plan will be \nprocured through the ADB indefinite delivery contract (IDC). IDC contracts are used to provide on-\ncall  specialized  services  when  the  extent  and  timing  cannot be  defined  in  advance.  IDC  is \ncommonly  used  to  retain  advisers  and/or  firms  for  implementing  complex  tasks,  institutional \nreforms, procurement advice, etc. Unit rates to be paid for the services and experts are agreed in \nadvance, and payments are made on the basis of the time actually used. \n \n9.  For  ESACDP  implementation,  it  is  envisaged  that  three  IDC  consortia,  drawing  on \ninternational, regional, and national sources, will be pre-qualified and retained on-call initially for \n2.5  years,  with  extension  of  IDC  qualification  subject  to  the  ESACDP  midterm  review.  Each \nconsortium will be expected to nominate an ESACDP consortium leader, who will be responsible \nfor dealing with any internal technical cooperation selection processes in the consortium and act as \nthe  only  direct  point  of  communication  with  the  ADB  Indonesia  Resident  Mission  in  Jakarta. \nRecruitment shall be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n10.  ADB will pre-select a minimum of three ESACDP consortia, based on proven track records \nin delivering and assuring the quality of technical cooperation services in the education sector, \npreferably in Southeast Asia, and related services for institutional reform, capacity development, \ninformation, communication, and knowledge management. A second pre-qualification criterion for \nthe  consortium  will  be  a  proven  track  record  in  delivering  a  mix  of  technical  cooperation \napproaches, which includes in addition to consulting services, study tours, institutional attachments, \nevent management, and knowledge management networks.  \n \n11.  A third pre-qualification criterion is a proven track record in supporting educational reforms, \nespecially (i) supporting legislative and regulatory reforms through research studies, study tours, \nwork attachments, and institutional links related to building government capacity to formulate and \nimplement revised sector policy, strategy, financing, and associated regulatory and organizational \ncompliance; (ii) supporting capacity development at the center and in districts through central, \nprovincial,  and  district  capacity  assessments,  developing  guidelines  for  organizational  reform \n ", "  Appendix 11  43 \nplanning, and support for organizational PFM, audit assessments, and forward planning; and (iii) \nsupport for improving information and communication systems through research studies, study \ntours, work attachments, and institutional links related to building organizational knowledge and \nlearning as a basis for internally driven change.   \n \n12.  The IDC procurement process will operate in the following way. The ESACDP program \nmanager will draft specific terms of reference and specifications for each assignment, supported by \nthe core advisory team.  These terms of reference will be forwarded to ADB, EU and AusAID for \nreview  and  action.  The  ESACDP  operational  management  specialist  will  circulate  terms  of \nreference to three pre-qualified ESACDP consortium groups selected under the IDC arrangement. \nEach ESACDP consortium will be required to submit a proposal to ADB through the ESACDP \nmanagement specialist within 30 days of receipt of terms of reference. The ESACDP operational \nmanagement specialist will conduct an evaluation of the three consortium proposals within 7 days \nof receipt. Within a further 7 days, the ESACDP operational management specialist will meet with \nthe ESACDP program director and program manager to discuss evaluation ranking and obtain a \nformal no-objection letter from the ESACDP program director for the ADB-recommended choice or \nagreed alternative. The ADB Indonesia Resident Mission will then proceed with formal recruitment, \nusing ADB procurement procedures. ADB Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time) will be applicable throughout implementation, with the expansion of procurement eligibility \nas noted above. As a result, a fourth pre-qualification criterion will be a proven track record in being \nable to participate in IDC-type consortia and respond quickly to ESACDP-type requests.1 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 For example, the EU framework contract and AusAID period offer contract arrangements. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "sza", "CreationDate": "D:20100524140810+07'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "ModDate": "D:20100617165447+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "Title": "Microsoft Word - ESACDP-6 MAY2010-TA Paper-to VP-President-approval-Revised 20 May wwrev-FINAL.docx"}, "author_page": " \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \nVice-President  C.
