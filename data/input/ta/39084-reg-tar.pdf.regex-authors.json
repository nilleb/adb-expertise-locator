The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  countries  have  a  vision  of  becoming  a \nprosperous, integrated, and harmonious subregion. To achieve this vision, they have adopted a \nstrategy to enhance connectivity, improve competitiveness, and promote a sense of community. \nIn particular, they are committed to intensifying their efforts in nine priority sectors and three \npriority geographical areas. The GMS North South Economic Corridor (NSEC) is one of the \nthree priority areas.1 Geographically, the NSEC embraces the area along the main north\u2013south \ntransport routes that link the economic hubs in the central and northern areas of the GMS \nsubregion.2 \n \n2.  A number of major infrastructure investments are already being undertaken by GMS \ncountries in the NSEC and more are planned. The physical connectivity of the corridor will be \nsignificantly improved upon the completion of these infrastructural investments. The improving \ninfrastructure, coupled with expanded cross-border cooperation among the GMS countries, will \naccelerate the process of integrating the NSEC's economic structures into both the rest of the \nsubregion and the rest of the world. To reap the substantial potential benefits, GMS countries \nalong the NSEC need to have a clearer understanding of the opportunities and challenges that \nwill arise from the economic integration process. The NSEC requires a well thought out strategy \nto promote sustainable development and ensure that the economic growth brought about by \nincreased integration generates benefits for the people without degrading the environment. To \nincrease its competitiveness, the NSEC needs to identify the areas where it enjoys comparative \nadvantages and promote private sector development in those areas. Greater efforts must be \nmade to improve the level and frequency of the interaction between the public and private \nsectors, and to mobilize both public and private resources to help realize the NSEC\u2019s potential. \n \n3.  At  the  request  of  the  GMS  governments,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will \nconduct a development study3 to help the NSEC identify and address major development issues \nthrough  a  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  project.  The  concept  of  the  project  was \nendorsed by the GMS leaders at the Second GMS Summit in July 2005. To prepare the project, \nADB  missions  visited  GMS  countries  and  held  discussions  with  government  officials, \nrepresentatives from development institutions, private sector entities, and civil society groups \nconcerning the objectives, scope, financing, and implementation arrangements of the RETA \nproject.4 The RETA\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  There are many challenges facing the NSEC at this early stage in its development. The \nchallenges are likely to become more formidable as economic integration continues. Therefore, \na priority of the RETA will be to identify and analyze the major issues that could constrain the \nNSEC, and formulate a strategy to address those issues. \n \n5.  In the 13 years since the launch of the GMS economic cooperation program, GMS \ncountries have demonstrated strong political goodwill in cooperating to achieve the goal of \ncommon prosperity. The GMS program features a set of cooperation platforms at various levels. \n                                                           \n1   The other two are the East\u2013West and Southern Economic Corridors. \n2  However, the investment study of the North South Economic Corridor (NSEC) will focus mainly on areas along the \nroutes from Chiang Rai, Thailand, to Kunming, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); Kunming to Hai Phong, Viet \nNam; and Nanning, PRC, to Hanoi, Viet Nam. \n3  ADB financed a similar study for the GMS East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC) in 1999. \n4  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 March 2005. \n ", "2   \n   \nThese platforms link, for instance, top leaders and ministers, senior officials and working group \nexperts,  governments  and  development  partners,  and  governments  and  private  sector \nrepresentatives\u2014including those from civil society. Significant progress has been made as a \nresult  of  these  cooperation  platforms.  For  instance,  GMS  countries  have  begun  to  clearly \nrecognize their increasing interdependence and the importance of aligning their development \nstrategies to harness the benefits of economies of scale. Cooperation and coordination at the \ngovernment  level  has also  led  to  concrete  achievements  such  as the  GMS  Cross  Border \nTransport Agreement. \n \n6.  In the NSEC, however, much remains to be done to take full advantage of the increased \ncommitment to cooperation demonstrated by the GMS countries. In particular, there is an \nopportunity for more effective private sector participation in the cooperation platforms. There is a \nneed to develop other mechanisms to translate the political goodwill into economic cooperation \nat specific locations. These mechanisms should enhance public\u2013private partnerships through \nongoing, effective dialogue. These mechanisms also should closely link local and international \ninstitutions and development experts. Such linkages would better utilize local knowledge and \nreflect local needs, while at the same time helping to introduce best international practices and \nmanagement know-how into the development of the NSEC.  \n \n7.  In developing the NSEC, it will be important to ensure that no investment gaps arise that \nprevent key infrastructure investments from yielding their full benefits. Similarly, corresponding \nmeasures may be needed to facilitate the use of the infrastructure and reduce the underlying \ntransaction costs. \n \n8.  To accelerate the economic development of the NSEC, it will be important to increase \nthe currently weak levels of private sector participation and investment in the corridor. Limited \npublic resources alone cannot drive the growth of the NSEC. There is no lack of enthusiasm to \nattract foreign direct investment (FDI) in the corridor. However, there is lack of knowledge about \nwho the potential foreign direct investors are and what sectors they might invest in. This points \nto a need to come up with a mechanism to communicate with potential foreign direct investors \non a regular basis in order to better understand their needs and interests. Such a mechanism \nwill help NSEC governments tailor their policies to draw more FDI, while helping potential \ninvestors better understand both the investment opportunities available to them and the laws \nthat regulate investments. This RETA will, therefore, explore the feasibility of developing\u2014and \nsubsequently piloting\u2014an institutional network to enhance public\u2013private partnerships in the \nNSEC. \n \n9.  Encouraging foreign direct investors to remain is as important as attracting them in the \nfirst place. As private investment increases, potential disputes between private and sovereign \nentities will also likely arise. Experience elsewhere in the world indicates that it is important to \nhave a scheme in place to mediate such disputes (a mediation-service scheme). For this \npurpose, GMS countries should engage only independent experts with proven track records in \nmediating investment disputes and preventing them from becoming politicized. If well structured, \na mediation-service scheme can play an important role in improving the investment climate in \nGMS countries. The issue of creating a GMS investment mediation-service scheme will be \nexamined under a separate GMS RETA. The investment mediation scheme, if implemented, \ncould also help improve the investment climate of the NSEC. \n \n ", "  3\n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The ultimate goal in developing the NSEC is to enhance economic development in the \narea and thereby improve the living standards of the people both in the corridor and elsewhere \nin the GMS. The purpose of the RETA is to accelerate the process of turning the north\u2013south \ntransport corridor into an economic corridor where the movement of goods, people, and capital \nwithin and across the subregion can take place with optimum economic and development \nbenefits. The RETA will help identify the major development issues facing the NSEC and \nformulate a medium-term development strategy for the sustainable development of the NSEC. It \nwill  also  help  strengthen  the  interaction  between  the  public  and  private  sectors,  thereby \nenhancing  their  mutual  understanding  and  dialogue  and  promoting  timely  and  efficient \ninvestment in the corridor. \n \n11.  The RETA will be results oriented. The major outputs of the RETA will be in the following \nthree areas. First, it will prepare an issues paper analyzing the major development issues and \nchallenges facing the corridor in the medium term. Second, it will prepare a development \nstrategy for the NSEC that will identify priority sectors and come up with an indicative list of \nmajor potential public and private investment projects in those priority sectors. Third, it will \nexplore  the  feasibility  of  designing  an  institutional  network5 linking  selected  local  research \ninstitutes  and/or  universities,  private  entities,  and  business  entrepreneurs.  Such  a  network \nwould  promote  regular  exchanges  of  views  and  information  between  policy  makers  and \ninvestors on issues related to trade facilitation, investment, and private sector development. The \nnetwork would also help disseminate the network partners\u2019 working results, create opportunities \nto cooperate, and encourage partners to follow up on the outputs from this RETA.6 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  A number of reports and studies, completed and ongoing, have covered some aspects \nof economic integration in the NSEC and the GMS at large. The GMS transport-sector strategy, \ntourism-sector  strategy,  the  Strategic  Framework  for  Action  on  Trade  Facilitation  and \nInvestment, the Cross-Border Transport Agreement, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) northern area development strategy, and private sector assessments of each GMS \ncountry are just a few examples. The RETA will build on the information and recommendations \nof these studies to formulate a coherent and coordinated development program for the NSEC.  \n \n13.  The  RETA  will  focus  on  economic  integration  issues  in  the  area  of  the  NSEC. \nSpecifically, it will examine how and to what extent the corridor is currently interlinked in terms \nof infrastructure, trade, and investment, and it will identify how such linkages are likely to \nchange  in  the  medium  term.  The  infrastructural  integration  analysis  will  include  linkages \ninvolving roads, railways, waterways, and air transport. The trade integration analysis will look at \nwhat commodities are being traded, whether commodities are being sold for transit or for final \nconsumption,  and  the  significance  of  trade  in  the  corridor\u2019s  development.  The  investment \nintegration analysis will identify potential major foreign direct investors in the NSEC, sectors \nlikely to draw FDI, and mechanisms that will encourage private sector investment. \n                                                           \n5  During the preparation of the RETA project, the ADB fact-finding mission met local institutions and private entities \nto discuss the concept of the network. The response received was positive and encouraging. \n6  One of the lessons identified from previous ADB operations, including the EWEC pre-investment study, was to \navoid activities that are not sustainable after the completion of the RETA. This highlights the importance of \ndeveloping the institutional network. \n ", "4   \n   \n \n14.  In addressing these issues, the RETA will also examine if there are legal, policy, or \ninstitutional constraints that may impede integration. Based on this analysis, the RETA will \nprepare an issues paper highlighting the major physical and non-physical constraints impeding \nthe corridor\u2019s infrastructure, trade, and investment linkages. It will further identify priority sectors \nfor the corridor\u2019s development based on underlying comparative advantages, and will help \nidentify an indicative list of major potential projects for investments by both the public and \nprivate sectors. It will prepare a development strategy to promote investment in the NSEC and \nhelp attract financing for the identified list of major investment projects. \n  \n15.  The identification and preparation of investment projects and priorities is important and \nmust  take  into  account  local  views  and  circumstances.  In  addition,  promoting  investment, \nparticularly private investment, is both a long-term task and a dynamic process, especially given \nthe pace of change in the GMS. Against this background, the RETA will engage local experts to \nwork with international experts during the implementation period. It will also aim to develop an \ninstitutional network, involving local institutions and private entities, for promoting investment in \nthe NSEC on a long-term basis. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the proposed RETA is estimated at $630,000 equivalent. The RETA will \nbe financed by the PRC Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China in an amount not exceeding $400,000, to be \nadministered by ADB, and by ADB's TA funding program for $200,000. GMS governments will \nprovide the equivalent of $30,000 in kind. The respective GMS authorities will also assist with \nidentification of local institutes and/or universities and business entities to participate in the \nproposed institutional network, and assist in organizing workshops to discuss and disseminate \nthe RETA findings and recommendations. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are \npresented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Coordination  Division  (MKOC),  Mekong  Department,  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  RETA.  MKOC  will  cooperate  and \ncoordinate  closely  with  ADB  resident  missions  in  the  GMS  countries  concerned  during \nimplementation. The GMS national secretariats in each country will act as national focal points \nfor  the  implementation  of  the  RETA.  They  will  also  facilitate  the  process  of  broad-based \nconsultation and participation in their respective countries. \n \n18.  The  RETA  will  be  implemented  by  a  team  of  individual  international  and  local \nconsultants under the guidance of ADB and in close consultation with the national focal points. \nADB will select and engage the individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. A total of 11 person-months of international consultants\u2019 services will be required, \ninvolving intermittent inputs by two individual consultants. A total of 40 months of domestic \nconsultant inputs will be required. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are presented \nin Appendix 3. The RETA will be implemented over a period of 20 months and is expected to be \ncompleted at end of September 2007. \n \n ", "  5\n \n19.  The  RETA  will  arrange  up  to  three  regional  workshops  to  discuss  its  findings  and \nrecommendations. In addition, the RETA will include national and local workshops to promote \nparticipation and dialogue with the community and interest groups along the NSEC.  \n \n21.  A final report will be printed and disseminated upon completion of the RETA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the PRC Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund \nfunded by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China; and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000, on a grant basis for the Greater Mekong \nSubregion: Development Study of the North South Economic Corridor, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nReduced poverty and  Economic growth rates,  National income accounts,  \u2022  Continued political stability \nimproved living  amount of investment,  trade and investment  in the subregion and \nstandards, resulting  and level of  statistics published by the  continued firm \nfrom increased trade  employment.
