In the proposed project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a $50 million \nsovereign guaranteed loan to the Regional Development Bank (RDB), a state-owned bank whose \nmission is to strengthen the living standards of the rural population by providing affordable and \naccessible credit facilities. The proposed project will provide long-term financing totaling $50 \nmillion worth of loans to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) outside Colombo and will be \nstructured to provide regulatory capital that would leverage an additional $533 million of lending.  \n \n2.  Research from 2017 confirms earlier findings that access to finance is a key barrier to Sri \nLankan entrepreneurs.1 Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) face constraints \non affordable financing on the demand side, such as poor commercial viability and difficulty \nmeeting financial institutions\u2019 lending requirements, and on the supply side, such as financial \ninstitutions having operations poorly designed for MSMEs and an overreliance on collateral-based \nloans. These constrains are even greater for MSMEs that are led by women or located in rural \nareas. Therefore, in addition to ADB\u2019s ongoing projects in the MSME sector, the government \nrequested ADB to enhance MSMEs\u2019 access to finance by strengthening RDB.2  \n \n3.  The proposed project\u2019s impact will be MSME access to finance enhanced. The outcome \nwill be RDB\u2019s strengthened capacity to serve its MSME clients. Project outputs will be (i) RDB\u2019s \noperations expanded, (ii) RDB\u2019s operational capacity strengthened, and (iii) the capacity of MSEs \nto access financial services enhanced.            \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will address the supply-side and demand-side \nissues that hinder MSMEs\u2019 access to finance by (i) strengthening the capacity of RDB to serve its \nMSME clients in rural areas and improve the enabling environment for MSMEs\u2019 access to finance, \nwhich will ensure financial sustainability beyond the project implementation period; and (ii) \nstrengthening the capacity of MSMEs at the policy level and individual enterprise level. Although \nthe project is a financial intermediation loan to be onlent to revenue generating MSE subprojects, \nthe transaction TA aims to transfer knowledge and enhance skills in RDB, MSMEs, and the \ngovernment. These activities cannot be easily monetized or structured on a cost recovery basis. \n \nThe government has confirmed this transaction TA through an aide-m\u00e9moire.3  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  The current growth of RDB cannot be sustained because of a capital shortfall. Although \nADB\u2019s loan, which will be structured as tier 2 capital, will provide some relief, RDB needs to ensure \nits financial sustainability beyond the loan implementation period. Therefore, RDB\u2019s institutional \nstrengthening measures have been agreed between RDB and ADB.4 The following transaction \n                                                \n1  International Finance Corporation. 2017.

The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 September 2018. \n4  Appendix of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the \nreport and recommendation of the President). \n ", "2 \nTA outputs are aligned with the project\u2019s outputs and primarily designed to support RDB in \nachieving these institutional strengthening measures, which could lead to ADB\u2019s Board approving \nadditional financing.    \n \n6.  Output 1: Regional Development Bank\u2019s operations expanded. The TA will support \nRDB in  \n(i)  strengthening its project management unit, and   \n(ii)  restructuring and relaunching RDB\u2019s deposit mobilization program, which includes \na women-targeted deposit product, to increase its retail saving deposits and \ndecrease its cost of funds. \n \n7.  Output 2: Regional Development Bank\u2019s operational capacity strengthened. The TA \nwill support RDB in  \n(i)   formulating a board strategy focusing on outreach to MSEs, including those led by \nwomen;  \n(ii)   strengthening market risk management to more effectively address liquidity risk, \ninterest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk, including upgrading risk management \npolicies and improving board reporting;  \n(iii)  strengthening credit operations and risk management by (a) upgrading the loan \norigination system with an information technology solution, (b) upgrading the credit \nscoring system, (c) revising the credit policy framework, and (d) providing loan \nofficers with credit appraisal training; and    \n (v)   strengthening safeguard management, including establishing and operationalizing \nan environmental and social safeguard management system.   \n \n8.  Output 3: Capacity of micro and small enterprises to access financial services \nincreased. The TA will develop supporting infrastructure to increase the capacity of MSEs to \naccess finance by  \n(i)  providing business development training (including financial literacy training) to at \nleast 500 RDB women clients;  \n(ii)  developing  and  implementing  a  train-the-trainers  program  on  MSE  business \ndevelopment and financial literacy for at least 60 RDB staff, of which at least 30 \nshould be women; and      \n(iii)   preparing a white paper on evaluating the effectiveness of government MSME \nsupport programs with an emphasis on women borrowers.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB and the \nremainder  will  be  in-kind  contribution  from  RDB  and  the  government  (para  11).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n10.  The following items are ineligible expenditures under the TA funded by JFPR: (i) purchase \nof  vehicles,  (ii)  salaries  for  civil  servants,  (iii)  any  foreign  travel,  (iv)  scholarships  or  long \ninternships, (v) detailed engineering design, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) \nthose under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities \nList.5 \n \n                                                \n5   ADB. 2011.
