I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL) and (ii) a proposed project grant, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Local Health Care for Disadvantaged Areas Sector Development Program.1 \n2.  The program is part of  a coordinated effort to assist the Government of Viet Nam \nachieve universal health coverage (UHC), including access to essential health care services. \nThe program is fully aligned with (i) the government\u2019s local health care (LHC) system2 reform \nagenda, and (ii) the Master Plan on Building and Developing of the LHC Network in New \nSituation. 3  The  program  complements  the  proposed  Second  Health  Human  Resources \nDevelopment Project, which will boost the quality and quantity of health care professionals \noverall, and provide systematic solutions to build the capacity of health professionals working in \nrural underserved areas. The PBL will support reforms to strengthen key areas in the LHC \nsystem, and improve health service delivery, and the quality of the LHC workforce. The grant \nwill fund the critical investment gaps necessary to translate these reforms into tangible results. \nThese investments will ensure access to quality health services and health security in remote, \ndisadvantaged, and border areas with a strong focus on the health needs of women. Policy \nreforms will have nationwide impact while the grant will focus on areas with high poverty levels. \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Development  context.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  has  bolstered  the \ncountry\u2019s progress in reducing poverty. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of \n6.5% per year from 1991 to 2017. GDP per capita reached $2,389 in 2017. The poverty rate \n(i.e., the share of the population living on less than $1.90 per day in 2011 purchasing power \nparity) fell from 52.9% in 1992 to 2.0% in 2016, while the Gini coefficient decreased slightly from \n35.7 to 35.3 over the same period.4 Poverty incidence varies significantly across regions. Ethnic \nminorities, who account for 14.5% of the population, make up more than half of the poor. 5 The \ngovernment has recognized that inclusive growth and public health are intricately linked, as \nshown by disparities in key health indicators by region. For example, in the impoverished \nCentral Highlands, infant mortality rate was 24.8/1,000 live births in 2015, while in the affluent \nSouth East region,6 it was 8.6/1,000 live births. Similar variations are also found in reproductive \nhealth and maternal mortality outcomes. 7  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The local health care system is intended to serve as the first point of contact between health services and the \npopulation. It encompasses the network of (i) commune health stations, (ii) district health centers providing public \nhealth and preventive services, and (iii) district hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient curative services. \n3  Government of Viet Nam, MOH.

Joint Annual Health Review 2016: Towards Healthy \nAging in Viet Nam. \n7  For example, in 2016 the national maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 58 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. \nIn comparison, the MMR in Dien Bien province (63 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) and in Lai Chau \nprovince (85 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) were very high. \n ", "2 \n \n4.  Inequitable access to quality and affordable healthcare services worsens the disparities \nin health outcomes and perpetuates income inequality. Inclusive growth is further threatened by \nthe growing financial  burden  associated  with  the  treatment  of  non-communicable  diseases \n(NCD).8  In 2015, the proportion of total disease burden attributable to NCD reached 73%, partly \ndue to Viet Nam\u2019s aging population.9 Catastrophic health expenditure is more likely to occur \namong households with NCD patients.10 Epidemic prone diseases can also have a significant \nimpact on health and livelihoods, and pose a further risk to inclusive growth, as evidenced by \nthe  economic  damage  caused  by  the  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  and  avian  flu \nepidemics.11 \n \n5.  The LHC system plays a central role in mitigating health-related barriers to sustainable \ninclusive growth. In Viet Nam, a strong LHC system, consisting primarily of commune health \nstations (CHS) is critical to ensuring equitable access to health care, especially for low-income \nand ethnic minority populations. It provides the foundation for effective long-term management \nof NCDs, as well as early detection of and timely response to health security threats.12 Local \ngovernments manage LHC investments, including budgets allocated by the central government. \nHealth  insurance  reimbursements  finance  recurrent  costs  for  LHC,  including  salaries  and \nequipment operation and maintenance. CHS provide various services: preventive health, basic \ncurative, obstetric, pediatric care, and inpatient treatment.13 Recognizing the important role of \nCHS, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is setting policies and standards, including frameworks for \nCHS financing. \n \n6.  However, Viet Nam\u2019s LHC system has been unable to deliver health care services \nadequately, and many CHS are considered substandard. Years of underinvestment in lower \nlevel facilities have perpetuated poor service delivery. In 2015, only 66.1% of CHS nationwide \nmet national service standards. The Northern midlands and mountain region, which achieved \nonly 44.6% of standards, was the worst-performing region. Out of 11,000 CHS nationwide, \nabout 1,192 require reconstruction and 1,239 require major renovation. Over 5,000 CHS need \nbetter equipment to provide essential health services, including for the timely detection of and \nresponse to communicable diseases. CHS lack the capacity for quick and accurate diagnosis of \npatients because of inadequate equipment and health workforce with an inappropriate skill mix. \nPatients perceive CHS to be of poor quality and often bypass them for higher-level and more \nexpensive facilities. Many conditions for which higher-level care is sought could be treated at \nCHS,  including  NCDs  and  age-related  illnesses.14 Further, patients  using  the  LHC  system \nreceive limited coverage from health insurance. As a result, out-of-pocket health expenditure \n                                                \n8  An NCD is a medical condition or disease that is not caused by an infectious agent. \n9  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

Improving \naccess to quality LHC services, particularly in poorer rural areas, will have a positive impact on \nhealth outcomes.  \n \n7.  Binding  constraints.  The  government  has  recognized  the  following  development \nconstraints: (i) an inadequate framework and supporting policies to guide public investment in \nLHC, (ii) the failure of LHC service delivery to respond to health needs, and (iii) weak LHC \nworkforce management and development. \n \n8.  Inadequate framework and supporting policies to guide public investment in local \nhealth care. The MOH has prepared a comprehensive framework for the development of LHC, \nincluding technical standards for facilities, equipment, human resources, and service provision. \nHowever, many are outdated and do not address the system\u2019s current challenges. Inadequate \ninvestment  in  the  LHC  system  and  a  lack  of  financing  mechanisms  perpetuate  system \ndeficiencies. The institutional arrangements for fiscal transfers from central to local governments \nand the incentives for local governments, to pursue the national health reform agenda are weak. \nWhile Viet Nam has a well-established health insurance system, additional reforms are required \nto increase health insurance revenues and to improve the affordability of health services.  \n \n9.  Failure  of  local  health  care  service  delivery  to  respond  to  health  needs. \nApproximately 74% of all outpatients visit hospitals and private facilities, while only 20% visit \npublic  CHS  due  to  the  limited  range  of  available  interventions.15 CHS  do  not  deliver  a \ncomprehensive mix of primary care and curative services, nor do they address the lifelong \nhealth needs of women and men in the community. For example, CHSs are not equipped to \nprovide for the effective management of NCD, across a continuum of prevention and early \nintervention  services. 16  Moreover,  district  health  centers  and  district  hospitals  operate \nseparately, largely without referral and linkage, causing inefficiencies and service overlaps.  \n \n10.  Weak  local  health  care  workforce  management  and  development.  The  LHC \nworkforce does not have the required skills mix to effectively respond to the evolving health \nneeds  of  the  population,  especially  women.  CHS  are  staffed  with  lower-skilled  health \npractitioners, particularly in remote and mountainous regions (footnote 16). They also lack the \ncapacity to provide long-term care for the elderly and patients with chronic diseases. There is a \nneed to enhance their competencies in epidemiology and in  responding to health security \nthreats.17 Moreover, health service providers have not been provided with the training to work in \na gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate manner when dealing with female and ethnic \nminority patients. While ADB has previously supported the MOH\u2019s health professional licensing \nand registration system, service delivery in LHC facilities remains largely unregulated.18 \n \nB.

The National Action Plan for the \nImplementation  of  the  2030  Sustainable  Development  Agenda  confirms  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment towards achieving UHC, which includes ensuring access to essential health care \nservices.21 \n \n12.  Sector  development  program.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  Viet  Nam \n2016\u20132020 prioritizes support to UHC as the focus of health sector operations. The program is \naligned with the operational priorities of ADB Strategy 2030 (Table 1).22 A sector development \nprogram  is  appropriate  given  Viet  Nam\u2019s  limited  fiscal  space,  need  for  PFM  reform,  and \ninclusive growth agenda.23 The program supports the health sector 5-year plan\u2019s objectives to \nenhance  the  accessibility,  responsiveness,  quality,  and  affordability  of  LHC,  particularly  in \ndisadvantaged  and  remote  areas  (footnote  20).  The  PBL  will  provide  budget  support  and \ncontribute to fiscal consolidation through targeted transfers in the health sector, allowing the \ngovernment to sustain budget allocations to the MOH while implementing a complex reform \nprogram. MOH has demonstrated experience with sector development programs (footnote 18). \nSpecifically, the PBL addresses key reform areas governing public investment, health service \ndelivery,  and  health  workforce  quality  in  the  LHC  system,  through  14  policy  actions  (all \naccomplished). The associated project grant will complement the PBL by implementing LHC \nsystem  reforms  including  infrastructure  and  equipment  standards,  and  health  insurance \nbenefits. The project grant will pilot health service delivery models and inform institutional \narrangements in support of attaining UHC goals. The project grant component supports reforms \nin 12 pilot districts in six provinces along borders and socioeconomic corridors with high poverty \nincidence, ethnic minority populations, and susceptibility to health security threats.24 \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Sector Development Program \n1.

Reform  area  1:  Public  investment  management  for  local  health  care.  The \ngovernment established an enabling policy and institutional framework to govern and guide \npublic investments for the delivery of LHC services. A master plan has been approved (footnote \n3) which sets the direction of the required policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms of the LHC \nsystem.25 Based on the master plan, the MOH updated architectural, equipment, and human \nresource standards for CHS and upgraded LHC infrastructure. As a result, 70% of CHS now \nmeet the national service standards (2017). To ensure revenues for LHC services, the MOH has \nenacted a series of policies defining a list of health services, medical procedures, and drugs \ncovered  by  health  insurance funds to  be  delivered  by  CHS.  Further, by  increasing  health \ninsurance  coverage  to  86.4%  of  the  population  (2017),  the  government  has  successfully \nincreased health facility revenues from health insurance. \n \n14.  The project grant will provide equipment for pilot districts to meet the national service \nstandards, including equipment for (i) diagnosis of infectious diseases, which threaten health \nsecurity; (ii) NCD detection and management; and (iii) sexual and reproductive health (SRH)-\nrelated  services.  Results from  pilot  districts  will  inform  necessary  adjustments to technical \nstandards for CHS, the financing mechanism, and the benefits provided by health insurance. \n \n15.  Reform area 2: Service delivery models for local health care network. To meet the \nchallenges of the rising NCD burden and public health threats, and to respond to the specific \nneeds of women, children, and indigenous peoples, the MOH formulated a set of policies aimed \nat improving health service delivery. An expanded package of health services for curative and \npreventive services has been adopted, which addresses the increasing needs of the population. \nSRH  services  and  gender-based  violence  prevention  and  response  programs  have  been \nstrengthened.  Specific plans for  indigenous  peoples  have  been  introduced. The  MOH  has \nadopted  and  scaled  up  the  family  medicine  model,  which  encompasses  the  holistic \nmanagement  of  an  individual\u2019s  health  needs  across  the  continuum  of  prevention,  early \nintervention, and treatment. To address gaps in long-term care, the MOH has approved the \nscope,  target,  and  budget  for  a  national  program  targeting  the  elderly.  The  MOH  linked \nindividual electronic health records to the communicable diseases information system as a tool \nfor referring patients between different levels of health services, and has implemented health \nfinancing through health insurance. Finally, provincial centers for disease control have been \nestablished and the functions of health centers and hospitals in 202 districts have been merged \nto better coordinate outbreak response and mitigate health security threats. \n \n16.  The project grant will enhance responsiveness of LHC service delivery through new \nservice delivery model(s) for disease surveillance and response, primary health care, and long-\nterm care using family medicine principles. The grant will equip pilot district health facilities to \nmeet the service delivery requirements of the family medicine model and implement the model \n                                                \n25 The master plan provides the road map to (i) upgrade and equip all CHS in the country, (ii) improve knowledge and \nskills of LHC staff, (iii) reform the packages of health services offered by LHC facilities, and (iv) improve health \nfinancing mechanisms through health insurance. \n ", "6 \nin  selected  CHS.26 Electronic  health  records  will  be  linked  to  the  communicable  diseases \ninformation system  in  selected  health facilities. Gender-sensitive  information  campaigns  on \nfamily medicine will be conducted and SRH-related services will be provided. District response \nunits will be equipped to address health security threats (footnote 12). Finally, analytical work \nwill help to optimize operational efficacy of the family medicine model before the nationwide \nrollout of reforms and health financing through health insurance. \n \n17.  Reform area 3: Local health care workforce development and management. The \nMOH has implemented reforms designed to achieve better gender balance in management and \nleadership  roles  based  on  the  MOH  gender  equality  action  plan,  2016\u20132020.27 The  MOH \nincreased the proportion of CHS served by a medical doctor to 88% in 2017.28 Measures were \nimplemented to improve staff knowledge and skills through a training curriculum on family \nmedicine for doctors, nurses, midwives, assistant doctors, and assistant pharmacists.29 A policy \nwas issued on health facility licensing for family medicine. \n \n18.  The project grant will strengthen the quality of the LHC workforce in pilot districts. To \ncomplement the health human resources policy, the grant will assess the capacity of LHC \nfacilities  for  health  security  functions,  family  medicine,  provision  of  a  basic  health  service \npackage, and service management. Competencies of CHS staff will be enhanced through the \nprovision  of  scholarships  for  a  3-month  certificate  on  family  medicine  for  CHS  doctors. \nContinuing professional education will be provided for assistant doctors, nurses, and midwives. \nTraining on communicable diseases, NCDs, elderly care, SRH, responses to outbreaks, and \nelectronic health records will be conducted. \n \n19.  ADB  experience.  Since  1995,  ADB  assistance  to the  Viet  Nam  health  sector  has \nfocused on improving access to and the quality of health care, especially for the poor and ethnic \nminorities. From 1995 to 2005, ADB provided support to (i) strengthen primary health care and \nfamily planning services in 15 provinces;30 (ii) improve primary health facilities, management \ncapacity, and human resources in 14 provinces;31 and (iii) develop hospitals, health service \nmanagement, health care funds for the poor, and human resources in five mountainous and \nethnic minority provinces. During 2006\u20132016, ADB continued its investment in health services in \nremote areas,32 while providing more focused support for health security. 33 ADB operations \nincluded (i) upgrading preventive health centers in 15 provinces; and (ii) enhancing regional, \nnational, and subnational systems for prevention, surveillance, and response to health security \nthreats. ADB also focused investment in health human resource development through sector-\nwide reforms in health professional education, training, and management (footnote 18). \n                                                \n26 Family medicine model implementation at CHS includes establishing a personalized electronic health record \nsystem; having a family medicine-certified doctor; and having at least a midwife, nurse, or assistant doctor who has \nattended a short course on family medicine. \n27 Government of Viet Nam, MOH.

Institutional reforms require a long-term strategy and policy coherence that \nbuild  upon  prior  gains  and  achievements,  thereby  creating  the  desired  impact  over  time. \nDevelopment effectiveness is enhanced by (i) strengthening development partner coordination, \nand  (ii)  sustaining  support  for  institutional  development  and  capacity  building.  Addressing \ncomplex disease patterns, population aging, and entrenched health inequity requires a shift to \nmore responsive and comprehensive health service delivery models. A strong and functioning \nLHC system supports timely detection of and response to health security threats both at country \nlevel and cross-border, the latter through regional cooperation.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s assistance in Viet Nam ensures the required institutional \narrangements required for UHC\u2014a strong LHC network, quality health human resources, and \nuniversal access to social health insurance. ADB assisted MOH to formulate and implement \npolicy  reforms for  strengthening  LHC, through  structured  policy  dialogue  informed  by  past \nprogramming. This includes in the areas of communicable disease control (footnote 33), health \nservice delivery (footnote 32) and health practitioner training and management (footnote 18). \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  has  also  been  enhanced  by  maximizing  linkages  across  individual \ninvestments, which creates synergies to achieve sector-wide and regional impacts. Linking the \nprogram with the ongoing regional effort to strengthen health security in the Greater Mekong Sub-\nregion is illustrative of this (footnote 33). \n \n22.  Post-program  partnership  framework.  The  post-program  partnership  framework \nprovides  a  common  understanding  of  subsequent  reform  areas  to  be  supported  by  the \ngovernment, ADB, and development partners (Appendix 4, column 3). The proposed Second \nHealth Human Resources Development Project (2019\u20132025) will complement the program by \nincreasing the supply of skilled workers to provide quality services, particularly at the LHC level. \nSubsequent analytical work and policy dialogue for PFM reforms and fiscal consolidation efforts \nthrough  a  national  targeted  program  for  health  sector  investment  are  required.  ADB \nstrengthened its role as knowledge provider by delivering the initial phase of reforms based on \nanalytical work and technical assistance to support health insurance and health information \nsystems development. ADB has ongoing technical assistance to strengthen the institutional \ncapacity  of  the  MOH  to  deliver  its  reform  agenda  and  identify  subsequent  regulatory  and \ninstitutional  reform  areas.34 This  coordinated  approach  sets  a  solid  foundation  for  ADB\u2019s \nprogressive support for health sector reforms aimed at progressing towards UHC (footnote 22).   \n23.  Development coordination. The master plan provides the overarching framework for a \ncoordinated  and  phased  development  partner  response  to  strengthen  the  LHC  network \n(footnote 3). ADB, the European Union (EU), and the World Bank coordinate and harmonize \ninvestments to achieve system-wide impacts as envisaged under the master plan. The current \nphase of development partner support to implement the master plan includes (i) the EU\u2019s Health \nSector  Policy  Support  Programme  (Phase  2),35 (ii)  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Health  Professionals \nEducation and Training for Health Systems Reforms Project (cofinanced by the EU),36 and (iii) \nthe World Bank\u2019s proposed Grassroots Service Delivery Reform Project. ADB maintains close \ndialogue with the International Monetary Fund on Viet Nam\u2019s economic and policy performance.  \n                                                \n34 ADB.

Impacts of the Reform \n24.  Economic  impact  of  the  program.  The  program  addresses  Viet  Nam\u2019s  need  for \nreforms to improve accessibility, responsiveness, and quality of the LHC system. The program\u2019s \nbenefits  derive  from  a reduction  in  (i)  the  morbidity  and  premature mortality  among  poor, \ndisadvantaged, and ethnic minority populations, and (ii) health expenditures through greater \nutilization of lower-level health facilities. The program will strengthen capacity to prevent disease \noutbreaks and pandemics and reduce the associated potential economic losses.37 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n25.  The program financing amount is $102.2 million. The government has requested (i) a \nconcessional loan of $88.6 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not \nexceeding $12.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help \nfinance the program (Table 2). The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The PBL release will be aligned \nwith  government\u2019s  investment  and  budgeting  processes,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). The project investment plan is \nin Table 3. The size of the PBL reflects the government\u2019s overall financing needs, the strength \nof  the  reforms,  and  development  expenditures  arising  from  the  program,  such  as  CHS \ninfrastructure upgrade, capacity building, and incentives for the health workforce. In 2018, the \ngovernment\u2019s budget deficit target is 3.5% of GDP, with a gross financing need of $17.1 billion. \nTo meet the financing demand, the government plans to raise $12.3 billion from the issuance of \nsecurities and $4.8 billion from official foreign loans. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional policy- 88.6  86.7 \nbased loan)     \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development  12.0  11.7 \nFund regional health security grant) \nGovernment of Viet Nama  1.6  1.6 \nTotal  102.2  100.0 \na Government counterpart funding is estimated at $1.6 million and includes civil servants\u2019 salaries, in-kind \nprovision of assets (office space, equipment, recurrent operating costs), or other paid-for costs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable 3: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem  Amountb \nA.

DUE DILIGENCE \n27.  Economic  and  financial.  Economic  analysis  of  pilot  provinces  suggests  that  the \nproposed investments in health services and infrastructure are economically viable. Economic \nbenefits will occur from increased utilization of lower-level LHC facilities and the family medicine \nservices, which will reduce healthcare costs, along with gains in labor productivity because of \nthe population will be healthier. The net present value of estimated benefits less costs is $25.0 \nmillion over a 15-year period. The economic analysis has not included benefits arising from the \nlower risk of economic shocks achieved through greater control of communicable diseases, so \nthe quantified benefits are likely to be conservative estimates. Careful health sector planning will \nbe  required to  ensure sufficient  resources to support  recurrent  costs  and  ensure financial \n                                                \n38 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nsustainability. Recurrent costs represent less than 0.2% of projected annual provincial health \nexpenditure. \n \n28.  Governance.  Financial  management  assessment  found  governance  risk  to  be \nsubstantial. The MOH\u2019s experience with externally financed projects, including those of ADB, \nindicates adequate overall capacity. Project procurement risk is moderate. MOH procurement \nteams  are  experienced  in  ADB  procurement  procedures,  and  the  requirements  of  the \ngovernment are broadly aligned with international procurement practices. Advanced training on \nADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Procurement \nRegulation for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended for time to time) is recommended for the \ncentral  project management  unit  of the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe Government of Viet Nam. \n  \n29.  Poverty and social impacts. The program will help improve access and increase the \nresponsiveness and quality of LHC services for populations in disadvantaged, mountainous, \nremote,  and  border  areas.  The  program  contributes  directly  to  improved  health  status, \nespecially for  the  poor.  Further,  indirect  contributions to  poverty  reduction  will  ensue from \nreductions in catastrophic health expenditure, a result of increasing health insurance coverage, \nand improvements in people\u2019s productivity. The project will benefit populations residing in six \nprovinces  with  high  poverty  incidence.  Enhanced  access  to  responsive  and  quality  LHC \nservices brings benefits to vulnerable populations in remote and border areas most susceptible \nto health security threats. These include the poor and minority populations for whom morbidity \nand mortality attributable to infectious diseases remain high, and vulnerable populations in \ndisadvantaged areas where the NCD burden is highest. \n30.  Gender. The program\u2019s gender category is gender equity as a theme. The program is \nexpected to contribute to gender equality and women's empowerment through improved health \noutcomes for women and girls. Women and girls will have improved access to quality local \nessential health services through CHS that are well equipped and incorporate gender-friendly \ndesign features. Service delivery will accommodate women\u2019s social and cultural preferences, \nincluding those of ethnic minority women and good-quality services critical to women\u2019s health \nand well-being, including SRH services. The policy-based program supports the launch and \nimplementation  of  the  health  sector  action  plan  on  gender  equality  covering  2016\u20132020 \n(footnote 27) as well as the adoption of other policies aimed at enhancing access to health \nservices for women, children, and ethnic minorities. The project includes a gender action plan to \nsupport  implementation  of  the  MOH  gender  equality  action  plan  and  other  gender-related \npolicies in areas including SRH, domestic violence, and the provision of gender- and ethnic \nminority-sensitive health services. \n31.  Safeguards. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis categorized C for environment because none of the policy reform actions or investments in \ndistrict hospitals involve civil works, and none are anticipated to result in adverse environmental \nimpacts or increased health and safety risks. The program is categorized C for involuntary \nresettlement since no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts are expected. A \nmatrix of potential impacts of policy actions has been prepared. The program is expected to \nbring positive impacts to ethnic minorities such as improving the capacity of ethnic minority \nhealth care staff and improving minorities\u2019 access to health services and improving the quality of \nthose  services,  especially  in  disadvantaged  and  remote  areas.  The  program  is  classified \ncategory B for indigenous peoples. The ethnic minority development plan will ensure that project \ngrant activities benefit ethnic minorities.   \n ", "11 \n32.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 39  Country  risks  pertain  to \nmacroeconomic instability, a high level of public debt, and a shift in political leadership, which \nweakens  support  for  LHC.  CHS  may  not  receive  sufficient  budget  to  finance  reform \nimplementation. Country level risks will be mitigated through continuous policy dialogue, support \nfor  targeted  interventions,  and  other  specific  measures  to  strengthen  PFM.  Project  pre-\nmitigation risk for PFM is rated high because each Department of Health in the six target \nprovinces will manage a subaccount. Project procurement pre-mitigation risk is rated high. \nMitigation  measures  include  staff  capacity  building  and  assistance  from  experts.  The  pilot \ndistricts  will  prepare  annual  plans  and  budgets  to  ensure  that  the  equipment  will  remain \noperational. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs, and \nfiduciary arrangements are put forward to minimize financial management risks. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The government and MOH have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and MOH have also \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which are set forth in the related legal \nagreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan and grant would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n(i)  the loan of $88,600,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Local Health \nCare  for  Disadvantaged  Areas  Sector  Development  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the \nrate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $12,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Local Health \nCare  for  Disadvantaged  Areas  Sector  Development  Program,  on  terms  and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \ngrant agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n19 November 2018 \n                                                \n39 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nUniversal health coverage for all citizens achieved (National Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 \nSustainable Development Agenda)a \n     )  Data Sources   \n  Performance Indicators with Targets and Baselines  and Reporting   \nResults Chain  Mechanisms  Risks \nEffects of the  By 2026, nationwide:     \nReform  a. 90% of CHS meet MOH\u2019s 2014 national standards  a.
