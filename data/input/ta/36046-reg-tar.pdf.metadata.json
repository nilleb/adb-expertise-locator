Road crashes are a growing worldwide problem, resulting in around 1 million deaths and \nover 23 million injuries per year. Around 85% of these deaths occur in developing member \ncountries (DMCs). The problem is particularly acute in the Asia-Pacific region, which has only \naround 16% of the world's motorized vehicle fleet but accounts for 44% of global road deaths.1  \n \n2.  Rapid economic development in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)2 \ncountries has increased the number of motor vehicles, significantly worsening road safety. In \n2000,3 ASEAN alone had an estimated 72,800 road deaths and over 1.8 million injuries, many \nserious  or  resulting  in  permanent  disability.  Road  crashes  cause  large  economic  losses \nannually, which inhibit economic and social development and worsen poverty.  \n \n3.  The fourth ASEAN transport ministers' meeting in Singapore in September 1998 thus \nagreed  that  road  safety  should  be  greatly  improved.  It  was  included  among  the  priority \ncooperation areas in the Successor Plan of Action in Transport 1999\u20132004. Because of the \ncontinuing deterioration in road safety and growing urgency of the problem, in August 2001 \nASEAN formally requested regional technical assistance (TA) to help strengthen the capacity of \nroad safety agencies in ASEAN members, and improve cooperation and share best practice \nacross the region.4  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The WHO forecasts that death and disability from road crashes will increase in all \ncountries, with road crashes moving from the ninth to third most important health problem by \n2020.5  While  the  more  industrialized  countries  have  in  recent  decades  steadily  and \nsystematically reduced the number and severity of road crashes by implementing coordinated \nmultisector remedial programs, the developing world, especially Asia, continues to witness the \nworsening problem. The very high proportion of two- and three-wheeled vehicles in ASEAN's \nvehicle fleet (Cambodia [75%], Indonesia [73%], Lao People's Democratic Republic [Lao PDR] \n[79%], Malaysia [51%], and Viet Nam [95%]); the mix of traffic; underdeveloped infrastructure \nand institutions; and rapid motorization all add to the growing problem. The fact that most recent \nvehicle growth has been in motorcycles exacerbates an already dangerous traffic environment; \nfor instance, the number of motorcycles in Viet Nam increased by 29% in 2001, resulting in a \n37% increase in road deaths that year. The situation will likely deteriorate even further unless \nurgent and effective action is taken to help ASEAN make its roads safer. \n \n5.  Road crashes impose costs on countries of around 2% of their annual gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and, on this basis, the cost to the ASEAN countries is estimated at over $11 \nbillion  annually.  These  recurring  economic  losses  undoubtedly  inhibit  economic  and  social \ndevelopment. Road crashes also disproportionately harm low-income groups as pedestrians \n                                                 \n1  Jacobs,  G.,  A.  Aeron\u2013Thomas,  and  A.  Astrop.  2000.

When a household head is \nkilled or disabled, poverty is significantly perpetuated or even increased.6 \n  \n6.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) carried out a regional road safety study7 in 1996\u2013\n1997 to quantify the scale and characteristics of the problem and to develop comprehensive \nguidelines to help DMCs address road safety. The guidelines raised awareness of the problem, \nand many countries subsequently included safety activities in their road sector operations. \nHowever, few study recommendations are being implemented, and the various initiatives and \npilot projects established during such projects have generally ceased with the completion of \nexternal assistance. In most cases, this is because the country has not established effective \ncoordination mechanisms or assigned adequate financial and technical resources to allow such \nsafety activities to continue and expand beyond the project. The resources invested in safety \nstudies, many of which have produced worthwhile action plans and recommendations, will not, \ntherefore, provide a return unless obstacles preventing their implementation are removed.  \n \n7.  Fact-finding visits to ASEAN members identified obstacles and impediments to road \nsafety and concluded that their removal would allow government agencies to become proactive \nand  effective  in  making  roads  safe.  ADB  can  be  the  \u201chonest  broker,\"  untainted  by  local \ndepartmental rivalries, in helping countries devise the best mechanism to facilitate effective \naction. \n \n8.  The proposed assistance will strengthen the capability and capacity of key agencies to \ncoordinate and implement road safety activities and help prepare road safety action plans that \ncan be used as frameworks to target resources and future assistance. The logical framework for \nthe TA is in Appendix 1. This TA will build on the earlier ADB assistance by helping ASEAN \nmembers strengthen their institutional capacity to address road safety issues more effectively. \nNo comprehensive regional program addresses road safety in ASEAN. The TA outputs will be \nuseful to all DMCs, and ADB will widely disseminate the results. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA's purpose is to develop institutional capacity in relevant agencies in ASEAN \nmembers to enable them to address road safety issues more effectively. In particular, the TA \nwill help identify problems and impediments preventing effective action on road safety and help \nthe  countries  develop  prioritized  action  plans  to  remove  such  obstacles.  The  TA  will  also \nstrengthen  subregional  cooperation  by  sharing  best  practices,  harmonizing  accident  data \nsystems,  and  developing  regional  strategies  and  approaches  on  common  issues  (e.g., \nmotorcycle safety). \n \n10.   The main components and outputs of this TA are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Institutional  strengthening.  Identify/remove  institutional  obstacles,  establish \nimproved  safety  management  structures,  establish  effective  coordination  and \nfunding  mechanisms,  develop  priority  action  plans,  and  implement  improved \naccident data systems.  \n                                                 \n6  Ghee, C., D. Silcock, A. Astrop, and G.D. Jacobs. 1997. Socio Economic  Aspects of Road Accidents in Developing \nCountries. TRL Report 247. Crowthorne.  \n7  ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance for Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila.  ", "    3 \n \n(ii)  Capacity building and human resource development. Upgrade knowledge \nand skills of key agencies to analyze in-depth accident data and develop targets \nand remedial countermeasures, develop crash cost estimates and show how to \nuse  them  to  improve  resource  allocation,  check  cost-effectiveness  of  safety \ninterventions, and develop local safety research capability. \n \n(iii)  Regional  cooperation.  Develop  regional  activities  and  workshops  to  share \nknowledge,  disseminate  best  practices,  develop  a  knowledge  network  and \nsharing mechanism among ASEAN countries, and promote links to international \nsafety organizations. \n \n(iv)  Private sector. Assess how the private sector and civil-society organizations can \nlead  in  safety  activities,  and  encourage  these  organizations'  involvement  in \nnational road safety priority action plans. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Discussions  with  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  and  agencies  in  the  individual  countries \nindicated that many of them had developed action plans or had completed safety studies in \nrecent  years,  but  that  such  plans  or  study  recommendations  had  generally  gone \nunimplemented. A number of institutional and other problems were found to be common to all \ncountries  and  preventing  effective  action:  ineffective  coordination  mechanisms,  inadequate \nbudgets and technical resources to manage and coordinate road safety activities, absence of \nknowledge about the true economic costs of road accidents, inadequate accident data systems, \npoor analysis of data, unsustainable funding of road safety activities, and safety problems due \nthe high volume of motorcycles in the vehicle fleet. Past failure to resolve and overcome these \nobstacles prevents effective action. ASEAN countries will be best served by helping countries \nidentify and remove the obstacles inhibiting their ability and effectiveness to address safety \nproblems.  \n \n12.   The TA will be implemented in three steps: (i) estimate the true costs of road crashes \nand quantify the scale and characteristics of the problem, identify/assess obstacles preventing \neffective road safety action in each country, and recommend appropriate policy and institutional \nreforms that ADB can adequately support through country action plans; (ii) consolidate the \nfindings and facilitate exchange of best practice and networking at the regional level; and (iii) \ntranslate  the  findings  and  consolidate  them  into  a  regional  strategy  to  support  individual \ncountries' reform agendas and ADB's regional efforts to improve road safety.  \n \n13.  The key activities of the TA are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Define road safety development with specific and relevant monitorable indicators \nto measure progress.  \n(ii)  Analyze  lessons  learned  in  ASEAN  and  other  regions,  including  innovative \napproaches, initiatives, organizational structures, and funding mechanisms that \nmight be applied in ASEAN. \n(iii)  Formulate for each country a monitorable action plan to establish the structures \nand mechanisms to address road safety issues, including strategic directions for ", "4 \nroad safety development in terms of priority interventions, reform processes, and \nsequencing.  \n(iv)  Consolidate the findings of the country road safety assessments and formulate a \nmonitorable  ASEAN  strategy  and  action  plan  that  will  identify  directions  for \nchange,  strategic  thrusts,  and  operational  priorities  in  terms  of  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms.  \n14.  The  priority  action  plans  will  be  prepared  during  national  workshops  with  relevant \nrepresentatives of government, private sector, and nongovernment organizations. The regional \nroad safety strategy and action plan will be discussed and developed at an ASEAN regional \nworkshop with senior DMC representatives. The plan will then be presented for endorsement at \nthe meeting of the ASEAN ministers of transport in September 2004. Commitment at this high \nlevel will facilitate implementation of the in-country and ASEAN strategies and action plan. The \nstrategy will guide ADB assistance to the countries.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total TA cost is estimated at $555,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 on a \ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Government of Singapore will cofinance, on \na parallel basis, $55,000 equivalent (comprising remuneration of Singapore resource experts \nand provision of training facilities) under the Singapore-ADB Cooperation Program. The details \nof the cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB's Regional and Sustainable Development Department, Finance and Infrastructure \nDivision, will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and the ASEAN Land Transport Working \nGroup will act as the project steering committee. A monitoring framework will be established so \nthat countries can report the progress of their road safety priority action plan at the semiannual \nmeetings of the committee. This will enable the monitoring to continue after TA completion. Use \nof the Internet for networking and communications will be encouraged to promote low-cost and \nsustainable knowledge sharing and technical cooperation across the region. \n \n17.  Consulting  services  of  29  person-months  (9  international  and  20  domestic)  will  be \nprocured by hiring individual specialists. The international consultant team will consist of a \nsenior road safety action plan specialist as team leader (6 person-months, intermittent) and a \nroad safety specialist (3 person-months, intermittent). The specialists will be supported by \ndomestic consultants working on an intermittent basis on road safety engineering, transport \neconomics, traffic enforcement, emergency services, education, and communication skills. In \neach country,8 domestic consultants will be appointed to estimate road crash costs, analyze \ndata, and help the country organize a national road safety workshop. The 2-day workshop, \nwhich  will  include  participation  by  international  safety  specialists,  will  discuss  key  issues, \nexamine ways to remove obstacles to road safety, and draw up a prioritized 3-year action plan. \nThe in-country workshops will be followed by an ASEAN workshop to address common issues, \nexchange information, share good practices, and develop an ASEAN road safety strategy and \npriority action plan. International and regional resource persons will be used during the national \nand regional workshops to discuss technical knowledge and describe best practice. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Consultants will be engaged as \n                                                 \n8  Except Brunei Darussalam, where consultants from a member country will be deployed. ", "    5 \nindividuals  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n18.  The TA will commence in March 2003 and be completed after 20 months by the end of \nNovember  2004.  The  consultants  will  submit  electronically  an  inception  report  and  brief \nprogress quarterly reports. Copies of country road safety action plans will be submitted to ADB \nand the ASEAN Secretariat as they are completed. Once the 10 country workshops have been \ncompleted and the individual road safety action plans prepared, a regional workshop will be \narranged  to  discuss  common  problems,  share  best  practices,  and  discuss  and  prepare  a \nregional  strategy  and  priority  action  plan.  Within  8  weeks  of  completion  of  the  regional \nworkshop, the consultants will submit a draft ASEAN regional strategy and priority action plan to \nADB, ASEAN Secretariat, and steering committee for comment before preparation of the final \ndraft. It will be presented at the ASEAN senior transport officials meeting in September 2004 \nand at the accompanying meeting of ASEAN ministers of transport for endorsement as a priority \narea in the ASEAN Transport Cooperation Framework Plan. A final report summarizing the \nproject and outputs will be submitted to ADB within 6 weeks of the presentation to the ministerial \nmeeting.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nRoad Safety in
