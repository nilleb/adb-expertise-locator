Consistent  with  the  overarching  goal  of  reducing  poverty  in  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has actively supported country led and \nregional initiatives to improve the performance of public services and combat corruption. A \nsignificant part of ADB\u2019s lending services are directed towards improving the provision of public \nservices in DMCs. The challenges of making service providers accountable and transparent \nhave become more complex as DMCs decentralize responsibility for the provision of public \nservices, and adopt different models of service provision.  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Capacity Development and Governance Division (RSCG) of the Regional and \nSustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD)  has  undertaken  complementary  regional \nanticorruption and service delivery networking and learning events.1 The regional activities are \nvalued by DMCs as they focus on practical application and know-how, and deal with issues that \nare current and relevant. This has created a demand for learning tool kits to further improve \nservice delivery. ADB, in partnership with the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI), has \nfunded the development of two e-learning tool kits: (i) the citizen report card (CRC) pioneered \nby the Public Affairs Centre (PAC), Bangalore, India; and (ii) the continuous improvement and \nbenchmarking (CIB) techniques pioneered by the Australian Continuous Improvement Group \n(ACIG), Melbourne, Australia. PAC and ACIG have requested support to institutionalize the tool \nkits and improve operational effectiveness. Two regional networks to strengthen the study and \npractice of public administration and governance\u2014the Eastern Regional Organization for Public \nAdministration (EROPA) and the Network of Asia-Pacific Schools of Public Administration and \nGovernance (NAPSIPAG)\u2014provide opportunities to promote the use of the tool kits.2 The Anti-\nCorruption Agency (ACA)3 of Malaysia has recently established the Malaysia Anti-Corruption \nAcademy (MACA) to provide training and become a center of learning, research, and discussion \nfor anticorruption prevention programs in the Asia-Pacific region. The ACA requested ADB \nsupport for MACA and confirmed the fact-finding aide-memoire outlining the scope of support in \nOctober 2004.  \n \n3.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)4 will  use  the  regional  networks  described  above  to \n(i) deliver courses on corruption prevention in service delivery to DMCs participating in the ADB-\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Asia-Pacific Anti-Corruption \nInitiative; and (ii) enable training institutions in public administration to incorporate the e-learning \ntool kits in their service delivery training curricula and support the service delivery reform efforts \nof public service providers and policy makers in DMCs by promoting the use of the e-learning \ntool kits. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Many DMCs face significant challenges to make services work for people, particularly \nthe poor, in a sustainable manner. Investments designed to improve services frequently lead to \nunsustainable delivery because of a variety of reasons, including (i) planning and management \n                                                 \n1  The Asia-Pacific Anti-Corruption Initiative \u201cPutting People First\u201d Service Delivery Regional Training Program, \norganized by ADB and the Organisation for Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Regional Seminar \nand Learning Event on Local Government and Pro-Poor Service Delivery laid the foundation for the regional \nproducts and services to improve service delivery and combat corruption. \n2  EROPA has written to RSCG expressing its interest in promoting the e-learning tool kits. Some participating \ninstitutions in NAPSIPAG have expressed interest in the tool kits. \n3  MACA is a member of the ADB-OECD Asia-Pacific Anti-Corruption Initiative. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 17 September 2005. \n ", "2   \nof services on the basis of inputs; (ii) minimal information on the quality, quantity, and cost of \nservices; (iii) inability to benchmark services; (iv) failure to involve service users in monitoring \nand reporting on the performance of the service; and (v) lack of a systematic mechanism to \nprevent corruption and mitigate corruption-related risks in the delivery of public services. Many \nDMCs  will  not  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  unless  these  challenges  are \neffectively addressed in a timely manner. \n \n5.  CRCs and CIB techniques5 have been used by governments and civil society in several \ncountries and led to improvements in the performance of public services. Some countries have \nbenefited from direct support provided by PAC and ACIG. Others have used local organizations \nthat have adapted CRC and CIB techniques to specific contexts. However, PAC and ACIG have \nlimited  capacity  to  promote  products  or  facilitate  implementation.  Furthermore,  there  is  no \norganized mechanism to increase awareness about the potential benefits of the approaches \namong public service providers and policy makers. The CRC and CIB e-learning tool kits go a \nconsiderable way towards addressing institutional and guidance gaps and have yielded positive \nresults from the field tests. The World Bank has already made use of the CRC and is adapting \nthe tool kit to assess specific constraints in water and sanitation services. Both tool kits need to \nbe actively utilized and made sustainable. The key issues that need to be addressed include \n(i) widening support organizations beyond PAC and ACIG, (ii) establishing mechanisms for \ndealing with queries raised by potential and new users of the tool kits, (iii) providing guidance on \nhow to incorporate these innovations in public training courses given by educational and training \ninstitutions in the region, (iv) strengthening ADB sector specialist capacity on service delivery \nimprovement programs, and (v) making tool kits available to improve the performance of public \nservices.     \n \n6.  The  review  of  the  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  governance  and  anticorruption  policies \nhighlighted the need for ADB to strengthen its support for country anticorruption initiatives. A \nsignificant problem facing many DMCs is the shortage of human resources with the capacity \nand  capability  to  mainstream  corruption  prevention  measures  in  development  programs, \nparticularly those concerned with improving the performance of public services. A few regional \ninstitutions have the ability to deliver practical and affordable training solutions to DMCs. The \nestablishment  of  MACA  as  a  regional  academy  for  anticorruption  training  is  a  welcome \ndevelopment  in  line  with  the  priorities  of  the  ADB-OECD  Anti-Corruption  Initiative.  The \npartnership with ACA offers an excellent opportunity to provide quality anticorruption training to \npublic service officers in the region.6  \n \n7.  Innovations in service delivery in the region do not have sound institutional platforms for \nsharing successes, scaling up, and making the outputs of the innovations sustainable. Training \ncourses in corruption prevention and service delivery require effective peer review to ensure the \ncourses are relevant for DMCs in the region. Regional institutional networks such as those \nestablished through the ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative, EROPA and NAPSIPAG provide \nan opportunity for a two-way meaningful engagement.7  \n \n                                                 \n5  Citizen Report Card. 2005. Available: www.citizenreportcard.com and Continuous Improvement and Benchmarking \n.2005. Available at www.acig.com.au/toolkit. \n6  MACA has submitted a proposal to ADB for a program of international courses in four modules. The proposal \ndraws heavily on its own experiences and contributions from countries participating in the ADB-OECD Anti-\nCorruption Initiative. \n7  EROPA  was  established  in  1960  covering  12  countries  and  is  supported  by  a  training  center  in  India,  a \ndevelopment management center in South Korea, and a local government center in Japan. NAPSIPAG is a more \nrecent network being established with ADB support since 2003. \n ", "  3\n8.  The TA responds to DMC needs for acquiring knowledge and capability to improve the \nperformance of public services and mitigate risks of corruption in their delivery through regional \nservice delivery products and training services. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected impact of this TA is strengthened DMC knowledge and capacity in the use \nof tools and techniques for (i) improving the performance of the delivery of public services, and \n(ii) preventing corruption. The training underpinning the CRC and CIB toolkits and the survey \nmethodology used by the CRC specifically consider service performance in relation to poor and \nmarginalized  persons.  The  outcome  expected  is  the  establishment  of  regional  services  to \n(i) provide training and support to DMCs in anticorruption preventive measures; (ii) promote the \nutilization of the CRC to conduct social audits of public services; and (iii) promote utilization of \nCIB techniques to ensure that capacity, resources, and people are managed to deliver effective, \nefficient, affordable, and equitable public services. The TA will be implemented in a manner that \nwill allow for the outputs to be sustained beyond the project through the specific institutional \narrangements described in the next section on methodology.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The methodology adopted for the implementation of this TA draws on lessons learned in \nimplementing earlier regional technical assistance (RETA) projects on service delivery and \nbuilds on the productive outputs of these RETAs.8 The links between the earlier and proposed \nRETAs are reflected in (i) consistency in terms of approach; (ii) taking a long-term view of \nchange; and (iii) building on earlier outputs through effective institutional support and better \ntechnical solutions.   \n \n11.  Innovative initiatives often experience problems in (i) moving beyond the innovation to \nscaling up implementation, and (ii) creating a critical mass of expertise in the region to be able \nto  support  and  sustain  the  innovation.  Other  lessons  learned  concern  (i)  minimizing  the \ntransaction costs for ADB RETA administration without compromising quality and lowering the \nchecks and balances necessary for effective implementation, and (ii) avoiding creation of new \norganizational  structures  for  implementation.  This  TA  has  been  designed  after  extensive \ndiscussions with ACA, PAC, and ACIG and from the results of the field testing of the e-learning \ntool kits. It also draws on advice provided by the governance adviser on anticorruption of the \nDepartment for International Development, United Kingdom.   \n \n12.  A  key  feature  of  this  TA  is  to  utilize  existing  regional  anticorruption  and  public \nadministration institutional network arrangements to promote the exchange of knowledge and \ngood  practices  in  anticorruption  and  innovations  in  public  services.  Appendix  2  provides \nsummary institutional profiles of the three regional networks this TA will utilize for achieving TA \nobjectives. Appendix 2 also presents the expected roles and responsibilities of ACA, EROPA, \nNAPSIPAG, and ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative under this TA. Activities in DMCs will only \ncommence after no objection letters are secured from DMCs selected for training and service \ndelivery improvement support under this RETA.  \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1997.

PAC and ACIG will engage with the regional networks\u2014ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption \nInitiative Steering Group, EROPA, and NAPSIPAG\u2014on (i) the development and delivery of \nappropriate  training  courses  to  selected  network  members,  (ii)  enhancements  that  would \nstrengthen implementation of the e-learning tool kits, (iii) screen nominations for anticorruption \ntraining, and (iv) selection of DMCs where the anticorruption training and tool kits can be applied. \nPAC and ACIG will also train selected regional public administration institutions to facilitate \nincorporation of the tool kits in the syllabus of the service delivery training provided by the \ninstitutions. ACA, PAC, and ACIG will provide progress reports to the regional networks and \nADB. RSCG will provide oversight, quality assurance, and promote the tool kits and training \ncourses among ADB professional staff.   \n \n14.  Component One. ACA, through MACA, will develop the training courses based on their \nextensive  experience  in  delivering  courses  nationally  and  drawing  on  the  knowledge  and \nexpertise of international anticorruption institutions including Australia and Hong Kong, China. In \naddition, it will draw on the knowledge and expertise of the steering group members of the ADB-\nOECD Anti-Corruption Initiative who act as peer reviewers of the training products and services. \nThe TA will make a financial contribution to ACA to develop and deliver training to international \nstandards on corruption prevention. During the design of this TA, course parameters were \ndeveloped and are structured around four modules to allow flexibility and incremental skills \ndevelopment. An indicative outline of the course, sustainability requirements (including business \nand  financial  sustainability  plans),  and  services  to  be  provided  by  ACA  are  contained  in \nAppendix 2. This TA will fund the participation of 30 DMC officials in the training courses \nselected by the ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Steering Group based on applications received \nfrom members and predetermined selection criteria that justify relevance, immediate utilization, \nand gender balance. ACA through MACA will manage, deliver, and administer the training \ncourses.  \n \n15.  Component  Two.  PAC  and  ACIG  will  work  directly  with  EROPA  and  NAPSIPAG \nmember educational and training institutions through their annual and other networking events \nto  (i)  promote  the  tool  kits,9 (ii)  assist  in  the  incorporation  of  the  tool  kits  in  the  public \nadministration training courses, and (iii) assist in the implementation of the tool kits by public \nsector service providers and policy makers in selected DMCs. PAC and ACIG will support two \nregional workshops and learning events. The RSCG TA coordinator (para 18) will establish \nprocedures to be used by PAC, ACIG, EROPA, and NAPSIPAG to achieve TA outputs during \nthe inception phase. There is provision for EROPA and NAPSIPAG training institutions to \naccess TA resources for implementing the tool kits in DMCs and incorporate them in the training \ncourses.     \n \n16.  Component Three. Based on the experiences and feedback of EROPA and NAPSIPAG \nmembers, PAC and ACIG will produce improved versions of the tool kits. Working closely with \nEROPA  and  NAPSIPAG,  PAC  and  ACIG  will  identify  and  partner  with  selected  network \nmembers to design and develop enhanced versions. A mechanism will be put in place to ensure \nthat all network members have access to the latest versions that have been peer reviewed by \nselected network members. Partner network members will (i) consult and contribute to the \ndesign structure, content, and instructional guides; (ii) provide examples of cases that can be \nincluded in the revised versions of the tool kits; and (iii) contribute to the field testing of the \nupdated versions.  \n                                                 \n9  A soft launch of the tool kits took place at the NAPSIPAG Annual Conference in Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, from 5 to 7 December 2005.  \n ", "  5\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $875,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  and  administered  by  ADB.  Appendix  3 \npresents the cost estimates and financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for this TA and RSCG will be responsible for overall \ncoordination. An individual international consultant will be engaged as the TA coordinator and \nwill be supported by a domestic consultant. The international consultant will be based in RSCG \nand will be responsible for overall project supervision and for ensuring the delivery of project \noutputs within the described framework. In addition, the TA coordinator will be responsible for \npromoting  the  e-learning  tool  kits  among  ADB  professional  staff  with  responsibility  for \ndeveloping country strategies and projects/programs. Progress reports will be submitted by ACA, \nPAC, and ACIG through the TA coordinator to the annual ADB-OECD meetings (for component \n1) and EROPA/NAPSIPAG meetings (for component 2) and to ADB\u2019s Governance Community \nof Practice. The TA coordinator will provide an inception report, quarterly progress reports, and \na  final  report  summarizing  the  TA\u2019s  outputs  and  achievements.  Quarterly  monitoring  and \nfinancial reports will be prepared by the TA coordinator and submitted to the RSCG. The \nGovernance Community of Practice will provide strategic direction and oversight to ensure \nconsistency with ADB\u2019s priorities and processes.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 23 months commencing in January 2006 and will be \ncompleted  in  November  2007.  The  TA  will  require  up  to  48  person-months  of  consulting \nservices  (25  international  and  23  domestic).  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n20.  Consulting firms PAC and ACIG will be directly selected. The terms of reference for PAC, \nACIG,  and  the  TA  Coordinator  are  in  Appendix  4.  A  memorandum  of  agreement  (MOA) \nbetween  ADB  and  ACA  will  be  executed  for  the  development  and  implementation  of  the \ncorruption prevention training courses. In addition, memorandums of understanding (MOU) \nbetween  ADB  and  the  EROPA  Secretariat  and  ADB  and  the  ADB-OECD  Anti-Corruption \ninitiative  will  be  executed  to  ensure  their  commitments  under  this  TA  and  sustainability \nrequirements are met. ACA, PAC, and ACIG will disseminate the results from the TA as part of \nthe performance based reporting system of the implementing partners. In addition, all outputs \nwill be placed on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.

Institutional Profiles \n1.  Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA). ACA is a highly successful organization in combating \ncorruption  and  an  active  partner  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific. \nDuring the design of this technical assistance (TA), ADB undertook an institutional appraisal of \nACA  which  involved  missions  to  ACA;  interactions  with  senior  officials  and  trainers;  and \nextensive discussions with the Director General, Deputy Directors General, and the Director of \nInspection  and  Consultancy.  ACA  has  extensive  experience  in  providing  training  and \nconsultancy  services  over  many  years  to  the  public  and  private  sectors  in  Malaysia,  and \nsupporting  other  countries  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  Region.  With  full  support  from  the \nGovernment  of  Malaysia,  and  given  Malaysia\u2019s  remarkable  experience  in  promoting  public \naccountability and transparency, ACA is well positioned to provide an effective and continuing \ncapacity  building  program  in  the  region  through  the  establishment  of  a  dedicated  training \ninstitution.  \n  \n2.  Malaysia Anti-Corruption Academy (MACA). At the fourth steering committee meeting \nof the ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, \nin December 2003, the Malaysian Prime Minister announced the establishment of the MACA as \na regional center for anticorruption capacity building, promoting best practices in prevention, \ninvestigations, monitoring, enforcement, and in newer areas such as forensic accounting and \nforensic engineering. MACA is under the purview of ACA and is funded from the national budget. \nIts two main client groups are (i) public, private, nongovernment organization (NGO) sectors, \nand  communities  in  Malaysia;  and  (ii)  regional  stakeholders  who  have  a  responsibility  for \ncombating corruption in their countries. MACA has been established and its residential training \ncenter in Central Kuala Lumpur will be fully functional in early 2006. It is envisaged that the \nMACA will become a regional hub and knowledge center for anticorruption training. It has been \nset up with an initial budget of RM17 million ($4.5 million) from the Government of Malaysia.  \n \n3.  ACA has produced a strategic framework and operational plan for MACA which it has \nsubmitted to ADB. This plan describes the vision, mission, and organizational and management \narrangements for MACA. The business plan envisages MACA having six schools, including one \nas a Center of International Studies. This center plans to deliver courses for the Asia-Pacific \nregion that would include corruption prevention as well as community education courses as a \ncontribution to combating corruption. It also aims to hold workshops and seminars. MACA plans \nto have 254 staff over the next two years and include ACA officers who would act as facilitators \nand lecturers. The MACA is planning to develop a 3-year rolling business plan in 2006 which will \ninclude time-bound actions for achieving financial sustainability, plans for extending the courses \nto a wider audience over a medium-term time frame, and a fee-charging strategy.  \n \n4.  MACA  will  develop  a  program  comprising  four  modules  that  address  some  of  the \npriorities highlighted by countries in the ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative. This program of \ninternational courses would be known as Developing a Corruption Prevention Program. Courses \nhave been merged into four modules. The key goal of the whole program is to enhance the \nknowledge and skills of anticorruption and law enforcement officers of participating countries on \nanticorruption  strategies,  thus  strengthening  corruption  prevention  initiatives.  The  training \nprogram is designed to achieve the following objectives: \n ", " 10  Appendix 2 \n \n(i)  Enhance understanding of the principle components, tools, and techniques of \ncorruption prevention programs. \n(ii)  Impart  knowledge  to  participants  on  effective  corruption  tools  for  specific \ncorruption prone areas. \n(iii)  Provide a working understanding or knowledge of how to develop a corruption \nprevention program. \n(iv)  Assist in developing community education programs. \n(v)  Provide insight into corruption prevention initiatives in Malaysia.  \n(vi)  Develop a network of contacts and resource persons for information sharing and \nconsultation. \n \n5.  The establishment of MACA offers an opportunity to provide standing capacity in the \nregion to train public service officers on anticorruption. To get the best out of the opportunity, it \nis important to ensure that the training is (i) good quality and acknowledges the variety of \nsettings  in  which  it  will  be  applied,  in  particular  resource  constraints\u2014both  financial  and \nnonfinancial;  and  (ii)  an  integral  element  of  a  systematic  program  of  reform  and  policy \nimplementation in individual recipients\u2019 organizations in developing member countries (DMCs). \nIn other words, individuals should not be sent on training unless they are able to apply it when \nthey return to their organization.  \n \n6.  Eastern  Regional  Organization  for  Public  Administration  (EROPA).  Founded  in \n1960, EROPA is devoted to the development of the theory and practice of public administration \nin the Asia-Pacific region.10 EROPA is the first organization of its kind in the region. It consists of \nstate members, institutes or schools of public administration, universities, agencies, municipal \ncorporations,  and  individuals.  EROPA  organizes  regional  conferences,  seminars,  training \nprograms, special studies, surveys, research studies, and publications.  \n \n7.  Its programs and activities are carried out through the EROPA headquarters in Manila, \nPhilippines, and its three regional centers: (i) EROPA Development Management Center in \nKyenggi-do, Republic of Korea; (ii) EROPA Local Government Center in Tokyo, Japan; and (iii) \nEROPA Training Center in New Delhi, India. EROPA activities have been held in different parts \nof the region.  \n \n(i)   EROPA Development Management Center was established in November 1966 \nin the Central Officials Training Institute (COTI)11 in Seoul, Republic of Korea, as \nan  agency  under  EROPA,  to  contribute  to  effective  development  and \nimprovement of organization and management programs in public administration \nin the region. The Center, along with the COTI, has moved to a new area, \nKyenggi-do, in the vicinity of Seoul. The campus has modern and sophisticated \neducational and research facilities to revitalize the functions and activities of the \nCenter. The primary objective of the Center is to provide in-service management \ndevelopment training for senior executives in government at the national level. \n(ii)  EROPA Local Government Center was established in October 1964 in the Local \nAutonomy College of the then Ministry of Home Affairs in Tokyo, Japan, on the \nrequest of EROPA. The Group Training Course in Local Government likewise \n                                                 \n10 The EROPA Secretariat Office is located at the National College of Public Administration and Governance, \nUniversity of the Philippines.

Training in various aspects of public administration has been a \nvery  important  activity  of  the  Institute.  The  interaction  among  academicians, \npolicy makers, and administrators\u2014in the intimate objective environment of the \nInstitute\u2014is a special feature of the training techniques employed. \n \n8.  As of 2005, EROPA has 12 state members,12 98 group members,13 and 479 individual \nmembers.14 EROPA is a well-established professional network that has consultative status \n(Category II) with the United Nations Economic and Social Council since July 1956. It also \nmaintains  collaborative  linkages  with  different  international  and  regional  development \ninstitutions.  Since  its  inception,  EROPA  has  undertaken  various  activities  in  pursuit  of  its \nobjectives, largely with the help of governments which are member states of EROPA and \nfinancial support from international organizations. \n \n9.  The  principal  organs  of  EROPA  are  the  general  assembly,  executive  council,  and \nsecretariat  general.  The  general  assembly  is  composed  of  all  EROPA  state,  group,  and \nindividual  members  and  is  convened  every  2  years  in  the  region.  The  general  assembly \nformulates the general policies and gives overall financial direction to the organization. It also \napproves  applications  for  state  and  group  membership  in  the  organization  and  approves \nEROPA budgets and accounts. It elects its president and vice presidents, the executive council, \nsecretary general, and commissioner of audit, all of whom serve a 2-year term. \n \n10.  The executive council defines the EROPA region by designating by name the countries \nand territories comprising this region. This definition shall take effect upon approval by the \ngeneral assembly. The secretariat general is responsible for the execution of decisions and \ninstructions  of  the  executive  council,  coordination  of  the  work  of  the  various  centers  and \nservices, preparations for all EROPA meetings and communications, and correspondence. \n \n11.  Network  of  Asia-Pacific  Schools  and  Institutes  of  Public  Administration  and \nGovernance  (NAPSIPAG).  NAPSIPAG  was  established  in  2003  with  support  from  ADB. \nNAPSIPAG seeks to enhance the capacities of educational and training institutions of public \nadministration in DMCs by making governments and institutions perform more efficiently and \neffectively. NAPSIPAG provides a network of public administrators for educational and training \ninstitutes in DMCs to exchange information about lessons learned and best practices which can \nbe  used  to  improve  the  teaching  and  practice  of  public  administration.  NAPSIPAG  has \nconducted two international workshops since 2003.   \n \n12.  Some of the preparatory actions for creating a network include the (i) creation of a \ndatabase, (ii) invitation of interested institutions to a region-wide conference to launch the \nnetwork,  (iii)  selection  of  an  initiating/planning  committee,  (iv)  preliminary  preparations  to \nestablish a network secretariat, (v) identification of activities to be provided to the members, and \n(vi) identifying funding opportunities and modalities for a network. \n \n                                                 \n12 Australia, People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam. \n13 Comprises 37 network members, 55 regular members, and 6 associate members. \n14 Comprises 90 network members, 304 regular members, 54 associate members, and 31 honorary members. \n ", " 12  Appendix 2 \n13.  The proposed benefits that may be gained by the members from joining the network are \n(i)  enhancing  national  capacity  to  promote  good  governance,  (ii)  strengthening  member \ninstitutions,  (iii)  encouraging  improved  professional  competence;  (iv)  promoting  knowledge \nabout good governance, (v) creating a professional identity and community, (vi) promoting \nprofessional  standards  and  ethics,  (vii)  promoting  professional  communication  about  good \ngovernance, (viii) promoting the discipline of public administration, and (ix) promoting academic \nfreedom. \n \n14.  The prospective network members stand to achieve these proposed benefits through \n(i) holding regional and subregional meetings when appropriate, (ii) exchanging staff within the \nregion, (iii) hosting staff from outside the region, (iv) conducting seminars for staff development, \n(v) establishing relations with other similar regional networks, (vi) creating working groups to \nundertake specific research activities, (vii) informing members via a newsletter, (viii) having a \npublications program, and (ix) improving relations with external aid agencies. \n \n15.  Although the network registration and secretariat are being worked out, more than 100 \ninstitutions  in  the  region  have  expressed  interest  in  becoming  members.  NAPSIPAG  has \ntremendous potential in upgrading the quality of teaching public administration and becoming a \nchange agent to promote good governance in DMCs. \n \n16.  ADB and OECD. The ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative (the Initiative) for Asia and \nthe Pacific was launched in 1999 at a workshop for countries of the Asia and Pacific region held \nat the ADB headquarters in Manila and attended by 250 participants from more than 35 ADB \nand OECD countries and economies. The workshop reflected a strong consensus to fight \ncorruption, and began to raise awareness of the seriousness of the corruption problem in the \nregion. A second meeting was held in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in December 2000. Participants \nrecommended  that  ADB  and  OECD  support  countries  of  the  region  in  setting  up  efficient \nnational and regional anticorruption strategies. As a result, an informal group of experts from \n13 regional  countries15 and  a  number  of  donor  agencies,16 international  civil  society,  and \nbusiness organizations developed an Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n17.  During  the  third  ADB-OECD  Conference  on  Combating  Corruption  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific held in Tokyo, Japan, in November 2001, 17 countries of the Asia and Pacific region \nofficially endorsed the action plan.17 Structured around three pillars, the action plan provides for \na  comprehensive  set  of  actions  that  governments  will  take  to  (i)  develop  effective  and \ntransparent systems for public service, (ii) strengthen anti-bribery actions, promote integrity in \nbusiness operations, and (iii) support active public involvement. The action plan is in line with \nADB\u2019s commitment to combat corruption as set forth in its Anticorruption Policy.18 It is the main \ninstrument of the Initiative in the fight against corruption in the region. The implementation of the \naction plan takes into account the national conditions of countries concerned, and draws upon \nexisting instruments and good practices developed by countries of the region and international \norganizations. It is based upon two core principles: (i) establishing a mechanism by which \n                                                 \n15 People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, \nPapua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n16 ADB, OECD, Transparency International Australia, United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, World Bank Philippines, and Pacific Basin Economic Council. \n17 As of April 2005, 25 countries have endorsed the Action Plan: Australia; Bangladesh; Cambodia; People\u2019s Republic \nof China; Cook Islands; Fiji Islands; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; Kazakhstan; Republic of Korea; \nKyrgyz Republic; Malaysia; Mongolia; Nepal; Pakistan; Palau; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Samoa; Singapore; \nThailand; Vanuatu; and Viet Nam.  \n18  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", "Appendix 2  13\noverall reform progress can be promoted and assessed; and (ii) providing specific and practical \nassistance to governments of participating countries on key reform issues. \n \n18.  The Initiative\u2019s steering group is composed of national focal persons from endorsing \ncountries, the advisory group, and the secretariat19 of the Initiative as specified in the action plan. \nTo facilitate the implementation of the action plan, each participating country designates a \nnational  focal  person.  The  secretariat  manages  the  day-to-day  activities  of  the  Initiative, \nassisted by an informal advisory group whose responsibility is to help mobilize resources for \ntechnical assistance programs and advise on priorities for the implementation of the action plan. \nThe advisory group is composed of representatives from the international donor community, \nNGOs, and business associations. \n \n19.  Steering group meetings are held every 6 to 9 months to bring together focal points of \nendorsing countries and members of the advisory group to (i) review steps taken by endorsing \ncountries to implement the action plan, (ii) facilitate policy dialogue and exchange of experience \nbetween member countries on successes achieved and problems encountered in this context, \nand (iii) review and evaluate member country systems and standards in fighting corruption. \n \n20.  A key activity of the Initiative is the biennial regional conference bringing together focal \npoints of endorsing countries or representatives of governments, business, NGOs, trade unions, \nmedia, and civil society from Asian and Pacific countries; international financial institutions and \nother agencies; and OECD country participants. Conference participants will have a unique \nopportunity to make use of endorsing countries\u2019 experience gained in implementing the action \nplan,  enhance  their  capacity  and  knowledge  in  selected  areas,  and  gain  an  increased \nunderstanding of currently existing strategies to combat corruption in the region.  \n \n21.  Following  the  steering  group  meeting  and  regional  conference  in  Beijing,  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, in September 2005, the Initiative will seek to develop a number of concrete \ntools to further enable the region\u2019s countries to combat corruption and strengthen partnerships \nbetween Governments and nongovernment actors in the region and internationally. Seminars \nwill be identified and developed to improve the capacity and knowledge of member countries in \nselected areas, and gain an increased understanding of currently existing strategies to combat \ncorruption in the region, which will contribute to the development of a list of benchmarks to \nevaluate future progress and identify good practices. A training workshop on mutual legal \nassistance is already in preparation. \n \n22.  The secretariat will work with countries to realize their commitments. Future tasks of the \nsecretariat will include (i) identifying and organizing master training programs; (ii) encouraging \nmore countries to join the Initiative; (iii) assisting country members in implementing their priority \nareas of reform under the action plan; and (iv) strengthening partnerships, e.g., with the World \nBank and other donor agencies. Endorsements will be followed up with delegates from Brunei \nDarussalam, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Sri Lanka, who attended the meeting. The \nInitiative, through the secretariat, will address the needs of endorsing countries which intend to \nratify the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) by supporting them to adapt \ntheir laws and institutions in line with the convention agreements.  \n \n23.  The Initiative is preparing to deliver an intensive implementation agenda for the region \n6 years since the launch and 4 years after endorsement of the action plan. It is recognized as \nan important tool in the international anticorruption agenda, working with other initiatives such \n                                                 \n19 The secretariat is composed of staff from ADB and OECD. \n ", " 14  Appendix 2 \nas UNCAC and its implementation agency (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) and the \nAsia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Task Force responsible for implementing the APEC \nCourse of Action on Corruption. \n \nB.  Expected Roles and Responsibilities \n24.  ACA will enter into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with ADB to design and deliver \nregional anticorruption training courses that are subjected to peer review by the ADB-OECD \nsteering group. ACA will appoint a focal person to act as the coordinator and be responsible for \nensuring the following commitments in the MOA are delivered to a high standard through the \ndedicated regional training facility\u2014MACA. The key commitments are: \n(i)  Design and deliver an anticorruption training course consisting of four modules \nfor regional participants (Table A2). \n(ii)  Develop  and  provide  the  necessary  training  kits  and  reference  materials  for \nparticipants. \n(iii)  Work with the ADB-OECD steering group to ensure peer review and quality \nassurance.   \n(iv)  Coordinate with ADB-OECD steering group in identifying and selecting qualified \nparticipants for the anticorruption training course.  \n(v)  Provide the training staff, venue, official travel to agencies/offices, and meals for \nthe entire duration of the course. \n(vi)  Make  necessary  arrangements  for  travel,  documentation,  visas,  and \naccommodations of training participants. \n(vii)  Monitor and document the learning process. \n(viii)  Develop and submit a sustainability plan for delivery of the anticorruption training \ncourse to the ADB-OECD steering group and ADB\u2019s Governance and Regional \nCooperation Division (RSCG) through the TA Coordinator.  \n(ix)  Submit progress and end-of-course reports to the ADB-OECD steering group \nand RSCG through the TA coordinator.  \n \n25.  EROPA and NAPSIPAG will enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with \nADB to help promote the use of the citizen report cards (CRCs)20 and continuous improvement \nand benchmarking (CIB) techniques. Working closely with the TA coordinator, the steering \ncommittees of EROPA and NAPSIPAG will agree with the Public Affairs Centre (PAC) and the \nAustralian Continuous Improvement Group (ACIG) on a system for providing support to selected \nnetwork members which have agreed and have demonstrable capacity to incorporate the use of \nCRCs and CIB techniques in their teaching/training curricula and use the corresponding e-\nlearning  tool  kits  in  undertaking  service  delivery  improvement  initiatives.  EROPA  and \nNAPSIPAG will specifically do the following: \n(i)  Facilitate  the  promotion  of  the  CRC21 and  CIB  e-learning  tool  kits  in  their \nprograms and conferences. \n                                                 \n20 CRC was first introduced by the Public Affairs Centre (PAC) in India and was later used by other countries in \nstrengthening citizens\u2019 voice such as Argentina, Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of China, Ethiopia, Gambia, \nGhana, Indonesia, Nepal, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Uganda, and Ukraine. In addition to \nAustralia, ACIG promoted the use of CIB to improve public services in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, \nFiji, Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Sri Lanka, and Vanuatu.  \n21 The CRC learning tool kit was field-tested by (i) Association for Promoting Social Action (APSA), a child-centered \ncommunity-based in organization in Bangalore, India; (ii) Center for Youth and Social Development (CYSD), an \nNGO in Bhubaneshwar, India; and (ii) the Center for Local and Regional Governance of the National College of \nPublic Administration and Governance, University of the Philippines.
