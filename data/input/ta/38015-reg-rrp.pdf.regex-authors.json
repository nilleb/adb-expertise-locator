The Sustainable Tourism Development Project (the \nProject) will not have significant adverse environmental effects. \nInitial environmental examinations were prepared for (i) each of \nthe subprojects identified under component 1 for each country \nand (ii) likely interventions to be identified under components 2 \nand 3.  Environmental assessment and review frameworks were \nprepared for each country.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project will support the development of tourism in the Greater \n  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  that  is  economically  viable  and \nenvironmentally  and  socially  sustainable  and  that  benefits  the \npoor. It will develop demonstration subprojects in the Lao PDR \nand Viet Nam that improve the environment at urban and natural \ntourism sites, benefit ethnic groups/minorities and the poor, and \nprotect vulnerable people from potential negative impacts. The \nProject will contribute to transforming GMS transport corridors into \neconomic corridors by developing tourism opportunities along the \nroads  and  improving  the  human  resource  capacity  of  tourism \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and public sector \ntourism organizations. It will contribute to more inclusive growth, \nenvironmental  sustainability,  and  regional  cooperation  in  the \nGMS.  The  Project  will  include  the  construction  of  handicraft \nmarkets,  viewing  points,  small  access  roads,  walking  trails, \ntourism signage, information and visitor centers, parking areas, \nsmall river piers, community lodges, and protective and sanitary \nfacilities. It will formulate plans for tourism site development and \nmanagement, provide training for local communities and private \ntourism  operators,  develop  marketing  strategies  and  products, \nand compose subregional tourism manuals. The Project will seek \nto  strengthen  and  encourage  fair  partnerships  among  local \ngovernments  and  communities  and  the  private  sector  in \ndeveloping,  operating,  and  maintaining  community  tourism \nfacilities and services. \n   ", "ii \nRationale  Tourism is an important sector in the GMS whose contribution to \nthe subregional economy has increased significantly in the past \ndecade,  creating  new  opportunities  for  economic  growth  and \npoverty  reduction.  However,  unmanaged  and  rapid  tourism \ngrowth has resulted in a pattern of tourism that concentrates on a \nfew destinations; threatens natural, cultural, and urban heritage; \nand contributes to undesirable social impacts. New opportunities \nprovided by the development of transportation corridors are not \nbeing utilized, and the capacity of tourism SMEs to service tourist \nneeds, and of the public sector to sustainably manage growth, are \nweak. As a result, the contribution of tourism to poverty reduction \nand  sustainable,  inclusive  development  in  the  GMS  is  limited. \nUnless  addressed,  these  issues  threaten  the  long-term \nsustainability  of  the  sector  and  its  ability  to  contribute  to \nsubregional development. \n   \n  The  GMS  Tourism  Sector  Strategy  (GMS-TSS)  2006\u20132015, \nprepared  by  the  GMS  Tourism  Working  Group,  indicates  the \nurgent need to design effective approaches to the sustainable use \nand development of natural, cultural, and urban tourism assets; \nspread the benefits of tourism more widely, especially to the poor; \ntap the tourism potential of the GMS transport corridors; and build \nthe capacities of private tourism SMEs and public officials. If well \nmanaged,  tourism  can  be  a  powerful  tool  to  preserve  and \nenhance  natural  and  cultural  heritage  and  provide  additional \nsources of livelihood in the remote rural areas of the GMS where \nmost of the poor live. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impacts of the proposed Project will be the development of a \nsustainable,  culturally  and  environmentally  sound,  pro-poor \napproach to tourism in the GMS and the preservation of natural \nand cultural heritage. It will contribute to the implementation of the \nGMS-TSS.  The  project  outcome  will  be  sustainable  tourism \ndevelopment that creates livelihood opportunities for the poor.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $21.98  million \n  equivalent.  The  cost  for  the  Lao  PDR  component  is  $10.87 \nmillion, including taxes and duties of $598,000. The cost for the \nViet Nam component is $11.11 million equivalent, including taxes \nand duties of $589,000. \n   ", "    iii \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nloan  of  SDR6,479,000  ($10  million  equivalent)  from  Special \nFunds resources to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, with a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The Government of Viet Nam will \nprovide $1.11 million equivalent as counterpart funds. It is also \nproposed that ADB provide a grant of $10 million from Special \nFunds resources to the Lao PDR, the Government of which will \nprovide $870,000 equivalent as counterpart funds. \n  Total   \nSource  ($ million)  % \nA.

The Mekong Tourism Coordinating Office will act as \nthe secretariat of SPSC. A national project steering committee will \nbe  established  in  each  participating  country  to  provide  policy \nguidance  and  oversee  project  implementation  nationally.  Each \nexecuting agency has established a project coordination unit with \na project director, a deputy director, and other professional staff. \nProject  implementation  units  have  been  stablished  in  the \nprovincial departments of tourism of each participating province to \nundertake the day-to-day implementation of the Project. Provincial \nsteering committees and community tourism groups representing \nstakeholders of the local community will be established. \n   \n ", "iv \nProcurement  Works,  goods,  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Each of the procurement \npackages for works will not exceed $1.5 million. Procurement for \nworks will follow national competitive bidding procedures in each \nof the participating countries that are acceptable to ADB. National \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  in  each  of  the  participating \ncountries  will  be  used  for  procuring  material  and  equipment \npackages  estimated  to  cost  between  $100,000  and  $500,000 \nequivalent. Equipment and materials that are locally available and \ncost  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  through \nshopping. Any procurement of works, goods, or services of not \nmore than $10,000 will be done through direct contracting.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A  total  of  250.5  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired for the Lao PDR component, and 226.5 person-months \nfor the Viet Nam component, to assist in project management, \nresettlement, gender and environment matters, and supervising \nthe  design  and  construction  of  tourism  infrastructure.  The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). In \nthe Lao PDR, services will be provided by individual consultants and \na firm. In Viet Nam the services will be provided by two firms. The \nfirms will be selected by quality- and cost-based selection.  Two \ntraining  institutions  will  be  recruited  to  provide  training  under \noutput  4  using  Consultants  Qualification  Selection.  Individual \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  for  external  monitoring  of \nresettlement impacts and project external monitoring.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Improved  tourism  infrastructure will benefit local residents and \nBeneficiaries  tourists.  The  Project  will  benefit  60,000  people  directly  and \n300,000 indirectly. An estimated 44% of all beneficiaries in the \nLao PDR, and 30% in Viet Nam, are poor. The capacity of trainers \nof tourism SME staff, and of public officials in pro-poor tourism \nplanning and management, will be enhanced. About 180 master \ntrainers, 400 trainers, and 800 government officials working in \ntourism-related institutions will be trained, of which 40% will be \nwomen and 30% will be from participating provinces or districts \nwith  a  high  percentage  of  ethnic  minority  residents.  Human \nresource development will improve the quality of service and the \ncompetitiveness  of  the  sector  and  provide  new  employment \nopportunities  and  higher  salaries  to  trainers  and  employees. \nProperly  planned  community-based  and  value-chain  tourism \ndevelopment initiatives will benefit the poor while protecting ethnic \nminority cultures and mitigating the potentially adverse impacts of \ntourism, especially on vulnerable groups such as women, youths, \nand  the  elderly.  Local  communities  will  be  provided  with \nalternative means of livelihood to supplement their income, which \nwill help to protect the biodiversity of the natural sites. Improved \n ", "    v \n  urban environmental infrastructure will reduce pollution and its \nassociated diseases. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Market Risks. Project benefits depend on the number of tourists \nvisiting the sites, which could decline due to internal or external \nmarket risks. To mitigate the risks, (i) tourism demand analyses \nand projections were prepared using conservative assumptions; \n(ii) each agency in charge of the facilities will prepare a business \nplan focused on risk management, especially market demand; \nand (iii) marketing and promotion activities for each subproject will \nhelp underpin the meeting of demand targets. \n \nProject  Implementation  Risks.  These  include  implementation \ndelays and cost overruns that can result from weak planning, \nmanagement,  administration  capabilities,  or  procedures.  These \nrisks  have  been  mitigated  through  the  development  of  clear \nprocedures and the provision of technical support and training to \nthe implementing agencies. The risk of cost overruns has been \nmitigated through careful and detailed cost estimation.  \n \nSocial  and  Environmental  Risks.  Uncontrolled  tourism \ndevelopment can cause congestion, increased pollution, and the \ndeterioration of destinations. Over-commercialization of cultural \ntraditions may degrade cultural heritage and the cultural identity of \nethnic  groups/minorities.  To  minimize  these  risks,  tourism \nplanning and management plans for each of the subprojects will \nbe prepared and carefully monitored. Environmental analysis and \nmanagement plans have been prepared to mitigate any potential \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n   \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and (ii) a proposed loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Sustainable Tourism \nDevelopment Project (the Project).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  Following the request of the GMS Tourism Working Group, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) approved technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare the Project. The TA built on a previous \nADB-supported study2 used to prepare the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy (GMS-TSS) and the \nlessons from the ongoing GMS Mekong Tourism Development Project (MTDP).3 The Project \ncovers two countries in the GMS, the Lao PDR and Viet Nam, which requested support from \nADB. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Tourism is one of the most dynamic sectors of the world economy, with rapid growth \nfueled by developing countries in Asia, especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and \nIndia, and in the Middle East. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that total global \ntourism demand in 2007 reached $7 trillion, accounted for around 10% of global gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), and employed 240 million people.4 International tourist arrivals exceeded 880 \nmillion,  with  total  receipts  estimated  at  $700  billion.5 The  United  Nations  World  Tourism \nOrganization forecasts that by 2020 international tourism arrivals will reach 1.6 billion and \ngenerate $2 trillion in gross receipts. The Asia and Pacific region is second only to Europe as a \ntourist destination and, by 2020, is expected to account for 25% of global arrivals, receipts, and \nemployment. \n \n4.  In 2007, the GMS countries and areas6 received 25.6 million international tourist arrivals \ngenerating receipts estimated at $18.85 billion and employing 3.74 million people. Over the \n1995\u20132007 period, international tourist arrivals to the GMS increased by an annual average rate \nof 8.12%\u2014more than twice the world average. Its share of world tourism increased over this \nperiod from 2.2% to 2.9%, and its share of Asia and Pacific region tourism rose from 11% to \n14%. Total international arrivals to the subregion are projected to grow by almost 13% per \nannum to 53 million by 2015 (or 4% of global tourism). The average length of stay increased \nfrom 6.5 days in 1995 to 7.6 days in 2007. However, the average daily expenditure per tourist \n(including expenditure on air fares accruing to national carriers and visa fees paid offshore) fell \nfrom $134 to $94 because the number of tourists from within Asia, particularly the PRC and \nThailand, increased more quickly than that of other regions of the world, and Asian travelers \nrequire less air transportation and generally spend less than travelers from outside Asia. Rapid \ntourism  growth  is  stimulating  unprecedented  demand  for  the  development  of  destinations; \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2005.

International tourism arrivals in the Lao PDR grew from 463,200 in 1997 to 1.63 million \nin 2007, with the average length of stay estimated at 7 days and the average daily expenditure \nat $53. About 60% of tourists enter the Lao PDR by land, through 15 international border \ncheckpoints, particularly over the Friendship Bridge connecting Thailand and the Lao PDR. The \nremainder enter through the international airports at Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Pakse. The \nLao National Tourism Administration (LNTA) estimates that in 2007 tourism generated $233 \nmillion in receipts, accounting for about 7.5% of GDP. The sector employs 32,000 people \ndirectly  and  400,000  indirectly.  By  2015,  LNTA  aims  to  achieve  3.57  million  international \narrivals, who will spend a total of $389 million and stay an average of 8 days. The Lao tourism \nproduct is associated with nature, Buddhism, and ethnic culture. The most popular destination is \nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage \nSite of Luang Prabang. Other important sites include Wat Pho in Champassak Province, the \nPlain of Jars in Xieng Khouang Province, Vang Vieng on the Nam Song River, Kong Island on \nthe Mekong River near the Cambodian border, and the capital city of Vientiane. Special interest \nand activity tours such as river cruises, biking tours, trekking, and weaving tours are becoming \nincreasingly popular. \n \n6.  International arrivals in Viet Nam grew from 1.71 to 4.17 million between 1997 and 2007, \nwith the average length of stay at 8 days and average daily expenditure at $96. The Ministry of \nCulture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) estimates that tourism generated $3 billion in receipts in \n2007, accounting for 3.5% of GDP. Direct employment in tourism is estimated at 1 million jobs. \nFor 2010, MCST targets 6 million international arrivals spending a total of $4.5 billion, employing \n1.4 million people, and contributing 6.5% of GDP. Viet Nam\u2019s tourism product leverages its \nunique cultural and natural heritage and its diverse ethnic cultures. Viet Nam has two UNESCO \nWorld Natural Heritage Sites, at Halong Bay and Phong Nga Kebang National Park, and three \nUNESCO  World  Cultural  Heritage  Sites:  Hue  Imperial  City,  Hoi  An,  and  My  Son.  Other \nimportant sites are the Mekong Delta, the protected areas of the Anamite Mountain Range, \nhistoric war sites, beaches, and the urban French heritage architectural. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  Despite the rapid increase in international tourism arrivals to the GMS and tourism\u2019s \ncontribution to the subregional economy, the benefits of tourism are concentrated on only a few \ndestinations and generally do not reach the poor.7 The capacity of governments and the tourism \nindustry to protect their environmental and cultural heritage from potential damage caused by \nthis rapid growth are weak, posing significant risks for the sustainability of the sector. The key \nchallenge for the GMS is to manage this rapid growth to ensure that tourists are offered a \ndiversity of high-quality products that benefit the poor and contribute to the preservation of the \nenvironment and the rich cultural heritage of the subregion. Public sector intervention in tourism \nis  required  to  (i)  minimize  infrastructure  constraints  and  bottlenecks  that  hamper  tourism \ndevelopment, (ii) regulate and monitor the use of public tourism assets by private operators to \nmitigate negative externalities, and (iii) expand opportunities for the poor to benefit from tourism. \nGMS governments need to establish partnerships with the private sector and local communities \nto develop models for a new subregional pattern of tourism development that (i) improves the \nsustainability of natural and cultural assets and urban areas for tourism, (ii) creates new tourism \nproducts that benefit the poor, (iii) taps the opportunities offered by the recently completed GMS \n                                                 \n7  A significant percentage of high-spending tourists visiting Lao PDR only spend a 2\u20133 days in the country and visit \nonly Luang Prabang, and most do not even venture outside the town. Many of the new businesses established in \nthe town are owned by foreigners, and most of their employees come from outside the province. This situation is \nrepeated in other countries across the subregion. ", "  3\ntransport corridors to promote subregional tourist circuits that can attract new tourists and help \nto increase the length of stay and expenditures, and (iv) enhances human resource capacity in \ntourism SMEs and among public sector officials to improve the competitiveness and quality of \nservice. \n \n8.  Tourism and Natural Heritage Conservation. The long-term sustainability of GMS \ntourism development depends on the preservation of its natural heritage. The rapid increase in \nthe number of visitors, combined with inadequate planning and management at many GMS \nnatural parks, protected areas, and wetlands\u2014such as Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park and \nHalong  Bay  in  Viet  Nam,  or  Siphandone  in  the  Lao  PDR\u2014has  increased  pollution  from \nunregulated activities, risking the environmental and economic sustainability of the destinations. \nPoor local communities living at the sites but not benefiting from tourism depend upon natural \nresources for their survival. To address these problems, it is necessary to develop effective \nmodels for sustainable tourism in natural heritage sites that conform to sustainable practices \nand standards by (i) improving water quality by efficiently treating sewage and reducing and \nmanaging solid wastes; (ii) developing and using local supply chains to reduce the impacts of \ntransportation; and (iii) involving local communities in managing the sites and allowing them to \nbenefit from tourism as an alternative source of income. The improved management of natural \ntourist sites can benefit both the environment and local economic development. Tourism can \nsignificantly  contribute  to  environmental  protection,  the  conservation  and  restoration  of \nbiological diversity, and the sustainable use of natural resources. Revenue from park entrance \nfees can be allocated to pay for protecting and managing the sites, as is done with a portion of \nreceipts at Phong Nga Ke Bang National Park in central Viet Nam. However, this practice is \napplied only at some UNESCO sites, and the approach can be extended to cover all natural and \ncultural sites of importance to tourism. \n \n9.  Unsustainable Urban Tourism. Uncontrolled tourism development in the GMS harms \nthe environment of such tourism urban centers as Vang Vieng and Luang Prabang in the Lao \nPDR and Hue City in Viet Nam, causing unsanitary and unsafe conditions for local populations \nand tourists that threaten to undermine the sustainability of the sector. Insufficient planning, \nlimited public sector investment, lack of experience in managing cost-recovery schemes, and \nweak institutional and regulatory frameworks have resulted in the pollution of urban rivers, \ncoasts,  and  groundwater  sources;  increased  flooding;  and  streets  full  of  rubbish.  The \nenvironment  of  urban  tourism  centers  needs  to  be  sustainably  managed  to  ensure  visitor \nsatisfaction and health, and mechanisms must be established for the tourists to contribute \nfinancially to the maintenance of urban infrastructure. To address this problem, it is necessary to \ndevelop models that demonstrate how to plan, finance, operate, and maintain environmental \ninfrastructure in urban tourism areas and to collect financial contributions from the tourists. \n \n10.  Risks to Ethnic Groups/Minorities. Ethnic groups/minorities often face constraints that \nprevent  them  from  seizing  the  opportunities  brought  about  by  tourism  growth,  such  as \nremoteness, limited mobility, and market access, low education levels, lack of familiarity with the \nnational language and the languages spoken by tourists, and limited capacity to negotiate \nequitable partnership arrangements with the private sector. Unmanaged tourism is damaging \nthe cultures, traditions, and norms of GMS ethnic groups/minorities. Women from small ethnic \ngroups face additional risks and increased demands on their time from tourism development, \nincreasing the risk, for example, of girls dropping out of school. Efforts to conserve and share \nethnic culture with tourists and younger generations carry the risk of branding minorities as \nexotic or backward. Tourism development provides a number of direct and indirect opportunities \nto ethnic minority groups for (i) increased income, (ii) locally led planning and development, (iii) \nrevitalized  cultural  practices,  (iv)  better  transport  and  communication,  and  (v)  better \ncommunication  with  authorities.  Developing  models  to  spread  tourism  benefits  to  ethnic \n ", "4 \ngroups/minorities in the GMS while protecting them from risks is fundamental to promoting \ninclusive development in the subregion. \n \n11.  Tourism Not Benefiting the Poor. The benefits of tourism bypass most of the poor in the \nGMS.  A  study  prepared  by  the  Overseas  Development  Institute  and  the  Netherlands \nDevelopment Organization in 2005 showed that only 27% of the tourist expenditure in Luang \nPrabang accrued to unskilled and semi-skilled people. Another study showed that in 2006 only \n10% of the $3.12 million spent by tourists in Kratie, Cambodia, went to people from a poor or \nnear poor background. Siem Reap is both the main tourist center and the second poorest \nprovince in Cambodia. Public officials lack models or experience in developing pro-poor tourism \nplans and initiatives in partnership with the tourism industry. Weak capacity, difficult access to \ncapital, low awareness of available opportunities, and cultural barriers to poor local communities\u2019 \ndealing with tourists have been key constraints to developing and implementing tourism services \nand products that benefit the poor. Models of tourism development are required that involve poor \nlocal  communities  in  the  provision  of  handicrafts,  food,  transportation,  accommodation,  and \nguiding services. These models would include the development of community-based tourism \nproducts in areas where the poor live that are attractive for tourists and the establishment of \nsupply chains that increase the contribution of tourism to the local economy. Tourism has significant \npotential to reduce poverty because it is labor intensive and uses natural and cultural assets owned \nby the poor. Tourism can empower the poor to improve their lives by providing opportunities and \nbuilding capacity for (i) employment, (ii) establishing SMEs, and (iii) investments where they live. \n \n12.  Tourism  Opportunities  along  Transportation  Corridors  Untapped.  The  GMS \ntransportation corridors and the implementation of cross-border transportation arrangements are \nexpected to facilitate and increase the flow of tourists within the GMS. However, limited planning \nand financing, the lack of infrastructure, and the absence of subregional cooperation models to \ndevelop  multi-country  tourism  circuits  along  transport  corridors  have  prevented  the  local \ncommunities  living  along  them  from  tapping  new  tourism-related  opportunities.  Significant \npotential  exists  for  transforming  transport  corridors  into  economic  corridors  through  tourism. \nDeveloping tourist attractions along the corridors\u2014such as constructing markets to sell locally \nproduced handicrafts and food to tourists and installing scenic viewpoints and visitor information \ncenters\u2014will encourage tourists to spend more time and money in these communities. Planning \nand marketing subregional tourist circuits along the newly developed transport corridors that \nconnect historical sites, natural areas, beaches, towns, and other tourist attractions can make \nindividual destinations more attractive to visitors and increase tourism benefits. Models and plans \nto develop sustainable tourism projects need to be developed that bring economic opportunities to \nlocal communities, particularly the poor, and help them to manage vulnerabilities and risks such \nas HIV/AIDS8 and human trafficking.  \n \n13.  Weak Tourism Human Resources. In the GMS tourism industry, the quality of services, \nespecially those provided by tourism SMEs, is generally poor. Hygiene standards are low. Many \nvocational  training  institutions  in  the  GMS  do  not  have  appropriate  curriculums  and  lack \nqualified trainers to support vocational training for tourism SMEs. Most officials in provincial and \ndistrict  tourism  offices  lack  the  knowledge  necessary  to undertake  basic  tourism  planning, \nmarketing, or regulatory and monitoring functions, or to mainstream poverty reduction in their \nplans. Managers of heritage sites lack the competencies required to manage them sustainably. \nEducational institutions lack the trainers and training programs required to strengthen capacity \nin these areas. Particularly limited is training on pro-poor tourism planning and management that \nis  environmentally  sustainable,  culturally  sensitive,  and  gender  inclusive.  Unless  effectively \naddressed, this problem threatens the competitiveness and sustainability of the tourism sector.  \n \n                                                 \n8 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

The  Strategic  Framework  of  the  GMS  Economic  Cooperation \nProgram (2002\u20132012) focuses on (i) enhancing connectivity, (ii) increasing competitiveness, and \n(iii) generating a greater sense of community among GMS countries. It is implemented through 11 \nflagship programs, of which tourism is one. Tourism is a priority under the Vientiane Plan of Action \nfor GMS Development (2008\u20132012) endorsed by GMS leaders on 31 March 2008. The program \nhas succeeded in improving physical connectivity by developing transport corridors, but benefits \nhave not yet accrued to the poor. Urgent interventions are required to tap the opportunities and \nminimize the risks created by these new corridors. The Project will contribute to the vision of the \nGMS program by (i) developing tourism circuits along transport corridors to tap opportunities to \nreduce  poverty  along  them  and  increase  connectivity  among  the  peoples  of  the  GMS,  (ii) \nenhancing human resources to increase the competitiveness of the GMS tourism industry, and (iii) \ndeveloping  model  tourism  projects  that  contribute  to  protecting  the  cultural  heritage  and \nenvironment of the subregion, distributing benefits to the poor, and generating a greater sense of \ncommunity.  \n \n15.  GMS Tourism Cooperation. The GMS tourism cooperation program started in 1993 \nwith the establishment of the Tourism Working Group (TWG), comprising senior representatives \nof the national tourism organizations (NTOs) of each GMS country. During its first decade, \nsubregional  cooperative  initiatives  in  tourism  focused  on  marketing  the  GMS  as  a  single \ndestination, developing tourism-related infrastructure, improving the quality of human resources, \npromoting dialogue between the private and public sectors, and facilitating the movement of \ntourists to and within the subregion. In 2005, TWG launched the GMS-TSS (2006\u20132015), which \nprovides an effective framework for developing a pattern of tourism that is environmentally and \nsocially sustainable, distributes the benefits of tourism more widely, and benefits the poor. The \nstrategy is being implemented through seven strategic programs that (i) foster the development \nof multi-country tourism in the GMS with common branding of culture, nature, and adventure \nattractions;9 (ii) provide for joint planning and development of tourism infrastructure; (iii) promote \nupgrading the skills of tourism officials, trainers, and workers; (iv) enhance the standards of \nmanaging natural and cultural resources; (v) help reduce the incidence of poverty and raise \nrural  incomes;  (vi)  encourage  private  sector  participation;  and  (vii)  identify  and  mitigate \nimpediments to travel to and within the GMS. The GMS-TSS recommends the preparation and \nimplementation of demonstration projects in these areas. To support the implementation of the \nstrategy, TWG established the Mekong Tourism Coordinating Office (MTCO) in Bangkok in \n2006, which is financed by contributions from TWG members. MTCO has developed action \nplans for marketing and development to implement priority projects under the strategy up to \n2010, endorsed by the first meeting of GMS tourism ministers in 2008 in Bangkok. \n \n16.  External Assistance to the GMS Tourism Sector. Tourism is increasingly recognized \nby many development partners as a tool for natural and cultural heritage conservation and \npoverty alleviation. Many development partners have become involved in tourism nationally and \nsubregionally in the last 5 years.10 The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia  and  the  Pacific,  United  Nations  World  Tourism  Organization,  and  other  development \npartners  have  supported  initiatives  to  enhance  the  skills  of  tourism  leaders,  trainers,  and \nprofessional managers and to expand the benefits of tourism to the poor through various \n                                                 \n9  A survey of 2,000 tourists conducted at five exit points in different GMS countries in 2005 for the preparation of the \nTSS showed that 35% of them visit more than one country and 15% visit three countries. \n10  The list includes (i) international organizations such as UNESCO, European Union, United Nations World Tourism \nOrganization, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia Pacific, International Finance Corporation, \nand  Pacific  Asia  Travel  Association;  (ii)  bilateral  donors  such  as  German  Technical  Cooperation,  Danish \nInternational Development Agency, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and New Zealand International \nDevelopment  Agency;  (iii)  international  nongovernment  organizations  such  Wild  Aid,  World  Wildlife  Fund, \nNetherlands Development Organization, and Conservation International; and (iv) training institutions such as the \nMekong Institute. \n ", "6 \nprojects. UNESCO has supported subregional initiatives to enhance standards for managing \nnatural and cultural resources for conservation and tourism. The Mekong Tourism Forum has \nbeen organized annually since 1995 with the assistance of the Pacific Asia Travel Association to \nenhance dialogue on tourism between the private and public sectors in the GMS. In 2005 and \n2006, tourism investment forums were organized with the support of the GMS tourism industry. \n \n17.  ADB has played a prominent role in supporting the GMS tourism sector. The MTDP has \nfacilitated the movement of tourists across the subregion by supporting the construction of airports, \npiers along the Mekong River, and access roads to tourism destinations. It contributed to the \nenvironmental  sustainability  of  key  GMS  tourism  destinations  through  the  construction  of \nmanagement systems for wastewater and solid wastes and to the distribution of tourism benefits \nthrough the development of 25 community-based tourism projects in poor areas of the GMS. The \nGMS Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management11 has supported several training courses \nto improve the tourism planning and management capacity of GMS government officials. ADB \nprovided assistance to TWG toward preparing the GMS-TSS and seconded staff to MTCO to \nsupport  its  implementation,  with  financial  support  from  the  French  Government.  Appendix  2 \nprovides a summary of tourism-related external assistance to the GMS.  \n \n18.  Lessons  Identified. Key lessons were identified from the MTDP and other tourism \nprojects in the subregion. First, promoting local ownership of tourism resources and projects, \nand training communities to manage them, is fundamental to ensuring that they keep control of \ntheir  own  development  and  benefit  from  tourism.  Second,  in  many  instances,  poor  local \ncommunities  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  implement  and  sustain  tourism  products  without \nexternal support and require partnerships established with the private sector. Public sector \nsupport  is  required  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  products  and  the  fairness  of  the \npartnerships. Two successful examples of public-private-community partnership supported by \nthe MTDP are in Luang Namtha and Luang Prabang, Lao PDR. In Luang Namtha, the tour \noperator Green Discovery increased the number of tourists on the Nam Ha Camping Tour by \n350%,  and  revenue  from  $3,965  to  $22,938,  from  2005  to  2007,  after  entering  into  an \nagreement with the provincial tourism department and the village of Dorn Xay. Villagers provide \nfood, guide services, site security, and trail maintenance for the tour program and receive about \n30% of gross revenue. In Luang Prabang, Tiger Trails, a local tour operator, entered into a \nsimilar agreement with the provincial tourism department and seven communities along the Fair \nTrek tour circuit. By the second year of operation, the tour had served 2,147 tourists and \ngenerated $64,376 in gross income, of which approximately 25% was paid to village and local \nservice providers. In contrast, the Phou Khong trekking program, operated independently by \nMaisingsampanh  village  in  Champasak  Province,    served  only  18  clients  in  3  years  and \ngenerated a mere $3,047.  \n \n19.  The third lesson was that clearly defined roles and responsibilities for subregional and \nnational committees and management units; well-defined job descriptions, training programs, \nand  financial  incentives  for  staff;  detailed  work  plans  and  budgets;  and  clear  reporting \nmechanisms are key for the success of the Project. Fourth, allocating adequate resources and \nsystems for regular monitoring and evaluation of performance is fundamental to assessing the \nimpact of the interventions and gaining support from community leaders and partners. Appendix \n3 describes these and other lessons that have been factored into the design of the Project. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11  Financed by ADB and other development partners. ", "  7\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The impact of the proposed Project will be the development of a sustainable, culturally \nand environmentally sound, pro-poor tourism approach for the GMS and the preservation of \nnatural  and  cultural  heritage.  It  will  contribute  to  implementing  the  GMS-TSS.  The  project \noutcome will be sustainable tourism development that creates livelihood opportunities for the \npoor. The project area is nine provinces in the Lao PDR (Bokeo, Champassak, Houaphanh, \nLuang Namtha, Oudomxay, Saravanh, Savannakhet, Vientiane, and Xayaboury) and five in Viet \nNam (Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Tien Hue), which were selected for \ntheir tourism potential, poverty rates, and inclusion in a GMS-TSS priority zone. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n21.  The Project will have the following 5 outputs: (i) model sustainable tourism development \nprojects protecting the environment and cultural heritage developed, (ii) pro-poor, community-\nbased, supply-chain tourism projects operational, (iii) GMS tourism corridors developed, (iv) \nhuman resource capacity of public and private tourism stakeholders improved, and (v) efficient \nproject management services. Four subprojects under output 1 were selected from a long list of \n120  candidates  included  in  the  GMS-TSS  based  on  selection  criteria  agreed  with  the \nparticipating countries. A sectoral approach has been adopted for the demonstration subprojects \nunder outputs 2 and 3 that will be identified during project implementation following the selection \ncriteria stated in Appendix 4. \n \n1.  Output 1: Model Sustainable Tourism Development Projects Protecting the \nEnvironment and Cultural Heritage Developed \n \n22.  This  output  will  develop  for  replication  throughout  the  GMS  four  model  tourism \nsubprojects  that  will  contribute  to  the  protection  of  important  natural  heritage  sites,  the \nimprovement of environmental conditions in urban tourism centers, ethnic groups/minorities\u2019 \nlivelihoods,  and  the  protection  of  their  cultural  heritage.  Each  subproject  will  include  the \npreparation, establishment, development and/or implementation of (i) heritage-based tourism \nmaster plans and zoning and management plans; (ii) small tourism-related infrastructure such as \naccess roads, boat landings, pathways and trails, and drainage and waste management systems; \n(iii)  capacity  development  and  livelihood  support  programs  for  local  communities,  especially \nincluding  women,  youths,  and  ethnic  groups,  to  develop  and  operate  community  tourism \nenterprises and revitalize cultural industries in partnership with private tourism operators;12 (iv) a \ngender and ethnic minority development program; (v) a database and geographic information \nsystem on cultural practices and indigenous knowledge in the area; (vi) a public awareness \nprogram targeting tourists, tourism operators, and local communities on natural and cultural \nresource conservation and protection, respect for cultural heritage, controlling the traffic in wildlife \nand antiquities, efficient waste management practices, HIV/AIDS, and other tourism issues; (vii) a \nmarketing and promotion program and materials to promote sustainable tourism and cultural \nproducts in association with local private tourism companies; (viii) institutional strengthening and \ncapacity building in the agencies in charge of operating and maintaining project facilities; (ix) \nmanuals to guide the preparation and implementation of future GMS tourism subprojects focused \non wetlands, protected areas, urban sites, and ethnic groups/minorities; and (x) a monitoring \nand evaluation program. These subprojects will help strengthen the local economy by creating \nadditional  livelihood  opportunities  for  local  communities  to  sell  agricultural  and  handicraft \nproducts; provide cultural and guide services; gain access to new and higher-paid employment \n                                                 \n12  The Project will promote the development of community-private sector partnership and the development of small \nand micro tourism enterprises. \n ", "8 \nin restaurants, shops, and transportation services; and establish new SMEs. The subprojects \nwill provide a more sustainable basis for private sector participation in the provision of services \nto tourists and generate sustained markets for local labor and locally produced handicrafts, \nagricultural products, and materials.  \n \n23.  Lao  PDR:  Biodiversity  Protection  in  the  Siphandone  Wetland.  The  Siphandone \nWetland is in Champassak Province and part of the biodiversity corridor through Lao PDR, \nCambodia, and Thailand. It contains about four thousand islands and is home to more than \n72,000 people. Poor communities living in and adjacent to the wetland depend on it for food \nsecurity and income. Over the years, the growing population and high fish prices have brought \nintensifed fishing and hunting, threatening Siphandone\u2019s biodiversity. The subproject will provide \nalternative income opportunities for local people such as employment in tourism information \ncenters, hotels, and guesthouses; as guides; providing tourist transport; and selling handicrafts \nand other products to them. Additional income from these new opportunities is expected to stem \ncurrent activities that contribute to the site\u2019s environmental deterioration. The subproject includes \n(i) upgrading a 4 kilometer (km) access road that connects Route 13 to the boat landing at \nNakasang  village;  (ii)  improving  existing  pathways  on  Don  Det  and  Don  Kone  islands;  (iii) \nenvironmental improvements at Nakasang and on Don Det and Don Kone; (iv) constructing visitor \ninformation and interpretation facilities on the Nakasang village side of the wetland; and (v) \nconstructing fully interpreted access trails at Nakasang and on Don Det, Don Kone, and other \nsmaller islands. \n \n24.  Lao PDR: Vang Vieng Town Environmental Improvement. Vang Vieng town functions \nboth as a tourist center and service point between Vientiane and Luang Prabang. The number of \ntourists visiting the town has grown annually by 15% to 20% and is expected to surpass 100,000 \nby  2008.  Tourism  businesses  pollute  the  environment  with  solid  wastes  and  wastewater \ndischarged directly into the drainage system and the river, which is also used for tourism activities. \nThe subproject will improve environmental conditions in Vang Vieng town, contribute to reducing \ndownstream river pollution, and protect the water quality of the river for local use and tourism. It \nincludes (i) expanding and improving the existing drainage system in the core area of Vang Vieng \ntown; (ii) upgrading selected roads in the core area to ensure that stormwater drains into side-entry \npits; and (iii) installing a bio-filter to remove a contaminants (e.g., hydrocarbons and sediments). \nThe subproject will strengthen linkages between the tourism industry and local suppliers of labor, \nagricultural products, handicrafts, and other materials. \n \n25.  Viet Nam: Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park. Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park is a \nUNESCO Natural World Heritage Site located in Quang Binh Province, approximately 500 km \nsouth of Hanoi. Covering 85,754 hectares of rugged limestone mountains, the park straddles the \nHo Chi Minh Trail and abuts the Hin Nam No National Protected Area in the Lao PDR. More than \n75,000 people live in communities around the park, and about 2,100 people reside in remote \nvillages within it. Since the area became protected, residents\u2019 loss of access to the forest and its \nnon-timber forest products has harmed their livelihoods. Tourism activities affect the sustainability \nof the site. The subproject will provide additional sources of income to local people by developing \nnew tourism products that will create additional employment opportunities in transport, tourism \ninformation, and accomodation. It will also improve the capacity of park managers to manage \nincreased tourism and contribute to the preservation of the natural environment. It includes (i) \nimprovements to the Phong Nga and Tien Son caves to facilitate access for tourists and minimize \ndisruption  to  the  site,  (ii)  the  development  of  a  new  nature  circuit  in  the  park,  and  (iii) \nimprovements to existing procedures for solid waste disposal and management. \n \n26.  Viet Nam: Ethnic Minorities Cultural Heritage Development in Bac Kan. Located in \nthe northern highlands of Viet Nam along Route 3, Bac Kan Province is 120 km north of Hanoi. \nAbout 85% of the residents of Bac Kan depend on agriculture for subsistence and livelihoods. \nAmong the 300,000 people living in the province, 87% are ethnic minorities, comprising the Tay, ", "  9\nDao, Nung, H\u2019mong, Hoa, and San Chay. Bac Kan is known for its rich ethnic traditions and \nnatural landscapes such as Ba Be Lake and National Park and Nang Tien cave. Since 2003, \ntourism has grown at an annual average of 23%, with about 100,000 overnight tourists visiting \nthe province in 2007. As ethnic minorities experience a rapid shift toward a market economy \nand urbanization brought by tourism growth, there is a risk of lost cultural identity and heritage, \nespecially language and oral traditions and indigenous knowledge, music, rituals, and belief \nsystems. Meanwhile, ethnic minorities do not benefit from tourism. The subproject will promote \nethnic culture and traditions in a way that is not exploitative but attractive to tourists. It will provide \nbusiness and employment opportunities to ethnic groups and help them benefit from tourism \nthrough the fair sharing of proceeds with private tourism operators, while improving their capacity \nto minimize potential social disruption. It includes (i) constructing a heritage interpretation and \nvisitor information center near Ba Be Lake, (ii) developing tourist destinations and products in \nselected villages, (iii) developing and delivering training programs for local residents at the new \ncenter to help revitalize cultural industries, and (iv) preparing and implementing a private sector \ninvestment program for cultural heritage tour operation and, potentially, eco-lodges. \n \n2.  Output  2:  Pro-Poor,  Community-Based,  Supply-Chain  Tourism  Projects \nOperational  \n \n27.  Output 2 will involve and benefit poor communities in the tourism economy through 33 \nsubprojects.13 It includes the development of tourism products and tours designed and operated \nby local communities in partnership with the private sector, and supply-chain initiatives to link the \nproduction of agricultural goods and handicrafts by poor communities to the local, regional, and \nnational tourism economy. Output 2 aims to protect ethnic cultures and minimize the adverse \nimpacts of tourism, especially on vulnerable groups such as women, youths, and the elderly. \nThe output aims to increase rural employment and the incomes of the poor by developing new \ntourism products and services in partnership with the private sector. The poor will benefit \nworking  as  guides  and  providing  food,  accommodation,  cultural  performances,  and  local \ntransportation  to  tourists.  New  opportunities  will  be  developed  to  produce  and  sell  local \nhandicrafts, food, and other products to tourists. \n \n28.  A sectoral approach has been adopted for this output, based on a demonstration model \ndeveloped for Aloui District, Thua Tien Hue Province, with other sites to be selected during \nproject  implementation.  The  output  includes  (i)  the  development  of  community-based  tour \nproducts and services, (ii) a public awareness program for tourism, (iii) the identification and \ndevelopment of tourism-related supply-chain initiatives, (iv) capacity development in tourism-\nrelated SMEs and communities, (v) the construction of small tourism-related infrastructure, (vi) a \ngender and ethnic minorities development program, (vii) a marketing and promotion program, \n(viii) the promotion of community tourism networks and tourism stakeholder associations, (ix) a \njoint manual to guide the preparation and implementation of pro-poor tourism initiatives in the \nGMS (coordinated between the Lao PDR and Viet Nam), and (x) a monitoring and evaluation \nprogram.  \n \n3.  Output 3: GMS Tourism Corridors Developed \n \n29.  The output will result in the development of GMS transnational tourism corridors. It will \nprovide models for a subregional approach to developing tourism opportunities along the GMS \ntransport corridors that contributes to their transformation into subregional economic corridors. \nThe  output  will  help  participating  countries  coordinate  with  other  GMS  countries, 14 local \n                                                 \n13  Three subprojects will be developed in 11 provinces: Bokeo, Houaphanh, Saravanh, Oudomxay, Sayabouli, and \nVang Vieng District of Vientiane in the Lao PDR and Thua Tien Hue, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Bac Kan and Cao \nBang in Viet Nam. \n14  Other GMS countries can join by financing activities in their territories with their own resources. \n ", "10 \ncommunities, and the private sector to develop tourism sites and circuits, joint marketing plans, \nand common tourism signage along the main GMS transport corridors. About 10 subprojects to \nimprove the infrastructure of tourism sites will be developed in the Lao PDR along the north\u2013south \neconomic  corridor  (NSEC),  which  links  Yunnan  Province  in  the  PRC  to  the  Lao  PDR  and \nThailand, and in Viet Nam and the Lao PDR along the east\u2013west economic corridor (EWEC), \nwhich links these two countries with Thailand. The Project will include activities to help manage \nthe risks associated with the increased movement of people and tourists across borders. \n \n30.  This output aims to create economic opportunities for local communities located along \nthe corridors; lengthen the time tourists spend in participating countries; create jobs, especially \nfor women and ethnic groups/minorities; protect the integrity of natural and cultural heritage at \nthe sites by installing appropriate infrastructure and management systems; promote private \nsector  participation;  and  develop  interpretative  materials  and  displays  to  add  value, \nunderstanding, and appreciation of the selected sites. The output includes (i) preparing tourism \ndevelopment  and  management  plans  for  individual  sites  and  each  economic  corridor;  (ii) \nconstructing tourism-related infrastructure along the corridors, including access roads, parking \nlots, ticket booths, information centers, walking trails, markets, and interpretation and sanitary \nfacilities, with partnerships between local communities and the private sector for investment, \noperations and maintenance; (iii) a community awareness and livelihood-support program; (iv) \ntourism management training for site managers and a local tour-guide training program; (v) a \nmarketing and promotion program; (vi) a gender and ethnic groups/minorities development \nprogram; (vii) a public awareness program for HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, drug abuse, and \nother tourism-related concerns; (viii) a joint manual on procedures and practices to develop \nGMS tourism corridors, coordinated between the Lao PDR and Viet Nam; and (ix) a monitoring \nand evaluation program.  \n \n4.  Output 4: Human Resources in the Tourism Sector Developed \n \n31.  Output 4 will create a pool of master trainers to meet training needs in the areas of (i) \nsmall-scale  tourism  and  hospitality  operations  and  (ii)  public  sector  tourism  planning  and \nmanagement. Under the first training area, some master trainers will be selected to train trainers \nof staff in tourism SMEs.15 Under the second training area, the Project will support master trainers\u2019 \ntraining of provincial, district, and local public officials responsible for tourism management in pro-\npoor  planning  and  management.  Training  will  focus  on  the  participating  provinces.  In  each \ncountry, a training institution for each of the two training areas will be selected, receive support to \nimprove its facilities, and partner with international institutions in training master trainers.  \n \n32.  In each country, the output includes (i) a review of the existing training needs assessment \nfor staff in tourism SMEs and public tourism officials; (ii) the revision or development of service \nstandards for SME tourism and hospitality enterprises, as well as related training standards based \non Association of Southeast Asean Nations (ASEAN) models and the training needs assessment; \n(iii) the development of gender- and ethnic-sensitive and -inclusive training kits and manuals, \nteacher  training  materials  and  case  studies,  best  practices,  and  lessons  learned;  (iv)  the \nproduction of CD ROMs and web-based training materials; (v) the development and maintenance \nof a web-based knowledge center accessible in all GMS countries; (vi) the translation of training \nmanuals into Lao, Vietnamese, and other ethnic languages; (vii) support to training institutions \nselected in each country; (viii) the training of master trainers in English and of trainers and \ngovernment officials in local languages; and (ix) a monitoring and evaluation program.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n15  Training of staff in tourism SMEs will not be financed by the Project.

In \neach country, this output includes (i) international and national consulting services with expertise \nin tourism development, heritage preservation and development, financial accounting, social \nand  gender  development,  resettlement,  environment,  civil  engineering  and  supervision, \ndeveloping systems of project performance management, ecotourism, supply chains and human \nresource development; (ii) support for project implementation and coordination; (iii) capacity \ndevelopment for project coordination units (PCUs) and project implementation units (PIUs); (iv) \nexternal monitoring for resettlement; (v) project auditing; and (vii) intermittent monitoring and \nevaluation of the Project by an independent consultant or institution. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n34.  GMS  Subregional  Cooperation.  The  GMS-TSS  recognizes  that  a  cooperative, \ncommon  approach  to  tourism  development  is  needed  if  the  subregion\u2019s  countries  want  to \ndevelop the sector in a sustainable way in an increasingly competitive market. The Project \nbuilds  on  that  principle  to  support  the  development  of  a  subregional  tourism  approach  to \nachieve the objectives of the GMS-TSS. It will enhance subregional cooperation and economic \nintegration by enhancing the attractions of key subregional tourism destinations, encouraging \nthe movement of tourists along the GMS transport corridors, promoting common approaches to \ncommunity-based ecotourism and value-chain activities, and improving the management of \nurban and natural protected areas of importance for tourism. The Project is expected to have an \nimpact on all GMS countries through the development of demonstration tourism subprojects in \nthe participating countries, which can be replicated across the subregion. \n \n35.  Improved  tourism  infrastructure  along  the  GMS  transport  corridors,  common  tourism \nsignage, and joint tourism marketing strategies for each corridor will help tour operators develop \nmulti-country circuits along the roads that could integrate the subprojects included in the Project \nand  the  entire  subregion.  The  Project  will  complement  other  GMS  projects  and  initiatives \nsupported by ADB, particularly the development of transport corridors (EWEC in the Lao PDR and \nViet Nam and the NSEC in the Lao PDR), the Core Environment Program, and the Cross-Border \nTransport  Agreement.  MTCO  will  serve  as  the  coordination  point  for  the  Project.  All  GMS \ncountries are expected to participate in meetings of the subregional project steering committee \n(SPSC) to exchange experiences, contribute to preparing the tourism manuals, develop GMS \ntourism corridors, and agree on a subregional approach to sustainable tourism development. All \nproject sites are located in one of the priority tourism zones identified in the GMS-TSS. Some \nareas of important natural and cultural heritage are shared by two or more GMS countries. GMS \nmanuals on (i) urban tourism, (ii) tourism management in protected natural and sensitive areas, (iii) \nethnic  groups/minorities and tourism,  (iv)  pro-poor  tourism,  and (v)  tourism corridors  will  be \nproduced and widely publicized. A GMS tourism database for human resources will be developed. \n \n36.  Poverty Reduction. The Project has been classified as a targeted intervention. As the \nproject  area  covers  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  two  countries,  30%  of  expected  project \nbeneficiaries in Viet Nam and 44% in the Lao PDR are poor. As these areas are important tourist \nlocations, great potential exists for the Project to reduce the high poverty incidence and contribute \nto inclusive economic development. The poor in the project areas will benefit significantly from \nproject interventions through the generation of new employment opportunities and tourism SMEs; \ndeveloping  community  ownership  and  self-reliance;  reduced  social  and  health  risks  through \nawareness programs; improved infrastructure, such as potable water, communications, roads, \nand access to markets; protection of natural and cultural resources; and a more sustainable \nenvironment.  The  Project\u2019s  pro-poor  tourism-development  activities  include  community-based \napproaches combined with supply-chain initiatives that aim to protect minority cultures, minimize \nthe adverse impacts of tourism, and provide livelihood opportunities for vulnerable groups such as \n ", "12 \nwomen, youths, ethnic groups/minorities, and the elderly. The output regarding human resources \ndevelopment will have a pro-poor focus and include training on developing and managing small-\nscale tourism interventions in poor areas and targeted capacity development for women, the poor \nand ethnic groups/minorities. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 5. \n \n37.  Gender. The tourism industry is particularly important for women, as the percentage of \nwomen employed in restaurants, hotels, and other tourism services is higher than in the general \nworkforce.16 Women will benefit through increased employment and the educational and other \nsocioeconomic  opportunities  generated  by  the  tourism  sector  such  as  food  production, \nhandicrafts, ceremonial celebrations, and the operation and management of small tourism sites. \nAt the same time, the Project has significant potential to promote gender equity by improving \nwomen\u2019s decision making in tourism management. A gender action plan has been formulated to \npromote the equal participation of all stakeholders as project beneficiaries. Key activities include \n(i) establishing mechanisms to promote women\u2019s representation in decision-making processes; \n(ii) integrating women\u2019s needs into project subcomponents; (iii) including targets for female staff \nin  project  implementation;  (iv)  training  communities,  government  officials,  and  other \nstakeholders on gender issues and risks related to tourism; (v) conducting awareness programs \nfor communities and government officials on HIV/AIDS, trafficking, and other social risks; (vi) \neffectively  involving  women  in  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  including  gender-\ndisaggregated data for these purposes; and (vii) reserving at least 40% of capacity development \nand training activities and 50% of the scholarships for master trainers for women. A summary \ngender analysis and action plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n38.  Community  Participation.  A  participation  strategy  is  incorporated  into  the  project \ndesign to help communities plan and manage local tourism destinations through an inclusive \nmodel of community and supply-chain development. The pro-poor tourism-development output \nwill enable community groups and individual households to set their own priorities for tourism \ndevelopment and to utilize and manage tourism sites as collective resources. The Project will (i) \nfacilitate and provide capacity building on community planning, management, operation, and \nmaintenance of local tourism development; (ii) conduct awareness campaigns on social risks; (iii) \nprovide sufficient opportunities for all groups to participate in the Project; (iv) build capacity in \npoor communities for developing ownership and self-reliance; and (v) ensure the monitoring and \nevaluation  of  participatory  processes  and  outputs.  Project  preparation  included  extensive \nconsultation with beneficiaries using participatory approaches.  \n \n39.  Ethnic  Groups/Minorities.  Ethnic  groups/minorities  in  participating  provinces  will \nbenefit from the preparation and implementation of demonstration projects aimed at developing \na sustainable, culturally and environmentally sound, pro-poor approach to tourism in the GMS. \nThe anticipated threats to ethnic groups/minorities under output 1 of the Project are very limited. \nThe Bac Kan subproject will help conserve and revitalize ethnic culture and traditions in the \nprovince, especially in Ba Be District, where 85% of the population is minority. The subprojects \nunder outputs 2 and 3 will include specific actions to enable ethnic minorities, especially ethnic \nwomen, to participate in capacity development for tourism-related micro-enterprises, ensure that \nthey benefit from the Project, and mitigate any risks. Each output includes a separate budget to \nsupport the screening and mitigation of tourism impacts on ethnic minority groups and develop \nmeasures for more equitable distribution of benefits among all ethnic groups. A summary ethnic \ngroups/minorities development framework for the Project is in Appendix 7. \n \n40.  Cost  Recovery  Mechanisms  and  Financial  Sustainability.  Cost  recovery \nmechanisms  are  built  into  all  subprojects  to  ensure  their  financial  sustainability.  The \nmechanisms, based on user or environmental charges and tourism entrance fees, will be used \nto cover the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of each subproject or to finance social \n                                                 \n16  UNDP. 1999.

Surveys of foreign and domestic \ntourists were conducted to assess their willingness to pay entrance and user fees at project \nsites. Surveys of commercial businesses and residents in Vang Vieng town were conducted to \nassess  their  receptiveness  to  environmental  user  fees  for  the  environmental  management \ninfrastructure  proposed.  The  Project  will  develop  models  for  minority  cultural  heritage \ninformation centers and natural protected area management agencies of importance for tourism \nto generate sufficient revenue from tourists, reinvest a certain percentage of it in preserving the \ndestination, and gradually reduce government subsidies, while benefiting local communities in \nthe area. Entrance fees to Phong Nha Khe Bang, Bac Kan, and Siphandone will be increased \nso that the agencies in charge of the sites get sufficient funds to cover O&M costs.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n41.  The cost of the Project is estimated at $21.98 million equivalent. The cost for the Lao \nPDR component is $10.87 million, including taxes and duties of $598,000, and for the Viet Nam \ncomponent $11.11 million equivalent, including taxes and duties of $589,000.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n43.  The project executing agencies (EAs) will be LNTA in the Lao PDR and MCST in Viet \nNam. The SPSC, with representatives from LNTA and MCST, will be established to oversee \nproject implementation subregion-wide. Directors general of LNTA and MCST, or more senior \nofficials, will alternately chair the SPSC. Representatives from NTOs of the other GMS countries \nwill be invited to discuss the lessons from the demonstration subprojects and the potential to \nreplicate  them.  MTCO  will  act  as  the  secretariat  of  the  SPSC.  National  project  steering \ncommittees (NPSC) will be established in each participating country to provide policy guidance, \nand oversee project implementation nationally. The committees will be chaired by a senior \nofficial of director general level in the EA, and their memberships will include representatives \nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  offices  of  GMS \ncoordinators, and participating provinces. In Viet Nam, the NPSC will also include the State \nBank of Viet Nam and in Lao PDR, the members will include the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. \n \n44.  In each participating country, a PCU has been established within the EA and headed by a \nproject director. The project director will be assisted by a deputy director and five staff who will be \nresponsible for project accounting; monitoring and evaluation; environment, natural and cultural \nheritage, gender, and other social issues. The PCUs will be responsible for (i) coordinating the \nProject; (ii) selecting and managing consultants, including for external monitoring of resettlement \nimpacts;  (iii)  submitting  all  necessary  data  to  the  auditor  on  time  and  the  audited  financial \nstatements  of  project  accounts  to  ADB;  (iv)  carrying  out  project  monitoring  and  evaluation;  ", "  15\n(v)  consolidating  project  reports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  and  the  Government;  and  (vi) \ncoordinating with the other PCU, MTCO, and the NTOs of other GMS countries. In the Lao PDR, \nthe PCU will be responsible for carrying out procurement. In Lao PDR, the PCU will also be \nresponsible  for carrying out  Procurement. The  PCUs  will  be supported by international and \nnational consultants. \n \n45.  PIUs  established  in  each  participating  province  will  be  responsible  for  implementing, \ncoordinating, monitoring, and reporting project activities at the provincial level under PCU guidance. \nIn Viet Nam, the PIUs will be responsible for carrying out procurement. They will be headed by a \nprovincial project director and include a project manager and five other staff who will be responsible \nfor  project  accounting;  monitoring  and  evaluation;  environment,  natural  and  cultural  heritage, \ngender, and other social issues. A provincial project steering committee will be established to \nrepresent agencies in charge of natural and cultural heritage site management, urban environment, \npublic  works,  and  transportation,  as  well  as  district  authorities.  Community  tourism  groups \nrepresenting stakeholders in the local community will be established for each subproject. Details on \nthe project management are in Appendix 9.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n46.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years from 1 January 2009 to 31 \nDecember 2013. An implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n47.  Works, goods, and services to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The PCU in the Lao PDR \nand  the  PIUs  in  Viet  Nam  will  be  responsible  for  procuring  works,  goods,  and  services \nprovincially. Each procurement package for works will not exceed $1.5 million. Procurement for \nworks will follow the national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures of the participating countries \nthat are acceptable to ADB. NCB procedures will be followed for materials and equipment \npackages  estimated  to  cost  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent.  Equipment  and \nmaterials that are locally available and cost less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured \nthrough shopping. Any procurement of works, goods, and services of not more than $10,000 will \nbe done through direct contracting. The first two contracts for works in each province will be \nsubject to ADB approval. Subsequently, the PCUs and PIUs will maintain specified documents17 \nfor review by ADB. A draft procurement plan is provided in Appendix 11. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n48.  To  support  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  250.5  person-months  of  consulting \nservices (78.5 person-months international and 172 person-months national) will be required for \nthe Lao PDR and 226.5 person-months (50.5 person-months international and 176 person-\nmonths national) for Viet Nam to assist project management, resettlement, and gender and \nenvironment  matters,  as  well  as  to  supervise  the  design  and  construction  of  tourism \ninfrastructure. In addition, the consultants will deliver on-the-job training and capacity building \nprograms for PIUs and PCUs. They will be engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). In the Lao PDR, individual \nconsultants will assist the PCU and PIUs in project management, and a firm will supervise the \ndetailed design of infrastructure. In Viet Nam, a firm will be selected to assist the PCU and PIUs in \nproject management and the detailed design of tourism-related infrastructure, and a different firm \nwill be recruited to assist the PIUs in supervising civil works. The firms will be selected using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method, and the weighting will follow the standard quality\u2013cost \n                                                 \n17 These include bid invitation letters, bid opening statements, bid evaluation reports or approval documents, and \ncontracts. \n ", "16 \nratio of 80:20. Additional individual consultants will be recruited in each country for external \nmonitoring  of  resettlement  impacts  and  project  external  monitoring.  All  consultants  will  be \nlocated in the PCUs. Two training institutions in each participating country will be recruited to \nprovide training under output 4 using the consultants qualification selection procedure. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n49.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the governments Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant and loan regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EAs and all contractors, suppliers, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project.  \n \n50.  The  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements to deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project will (i) build capacity in \nthe EAs, PCUs, and PIUs to understand and comply with ADB and government procedures as \noutlined in the project administration manual and (ii) widely publicize in communities in the \nproject area the existence of the integrity division in ADB\u2019s Office of the Auditor General, as the \ninitial point of contact for allegations of fraud, corruption, and abuse in ADB-financed projects. A \nproject  website  will  be  developed  to  disclose  information  about  project  matters,  including \nprocurement. To encourage more stakeholder vigilance as well as ensure greater accountability, \na  task  force  will  be  set  up  in  the  PCUs  to  receive  and  resolve  grievances  or  act  upon \nstakeholders\u2019 reports of irregularities. The task force will (i) review and address stakeholders\u2019 \ngrievances against the Project in relation to the Project itself, any service provider, or any \nperson responsible for carrying out the Project and (ii) set the threshold criteria and procedures \nfor handling such grievances, proactively responding to them, and providing the stakeholders \nwith notice of the mechanism. The community tourist group will be a member of the procurement \ncommittee  for  subprojects  handled  by  the  PIUs  to  ensure  transparency  in  the  awarding  of \ncontracts at the provincial and community level. Finally, external monitoring consultants will be \nrecruited to monitor resettlement impacts and project implementation. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n51.  The payment of eligible expenditures from the proceeds of the grant and the loan will be \nmade either through direct payment or imprest account procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account will \nbe established for the Project in each participating country. In the Lao PDR, the imprest account \nwill be established by the Government at the Bank of Lao PDR. In Viet Nam, the imprest \naccount will be established by the Government at a commercial bank designated by the State \nBank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The initial advances to, and the ceiling of, each \nimprest account will be based on estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account \nfor the first 6 months or 10% of the total ADB grant or loan amount, whichever is less. The \nimprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  each \nparticipating country\u2019s government and ADB. The statement of expenditures procedure will be \nused to reimburse and liquidate eligible expenditures under contracts not exceeding $50,000. \nThe PCUs and PIUs will each set up an account specifically for the Project. The accounts may \nbe opened at a commercial bank acceptable to each participating country\u2019s government and \nADB. In Viet Nam, any advance payment and subsequent replenishments to the PIUs\u2019 accounts \nwill be made directly from the imprest account. The funds flow mechanisms are in Appendix 12. ", "  17\n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n52.  The PCUs and PIUs will maintain project accounts exclusively established for the Project. \nA separate accounting system for project expenditures will be established and maintained in \naccordance with sound accounting principles. The consultants will provide training on the use of \nthe imprest accounts and operating support to PCUs and PIUs accounting staff. All project \naccounts  will  be  audited  annually  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  by  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable to ADB, using international accounting and auditing standards. A separate audit \nopinion  will  be  issued  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures. The consolidated audit reports will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the \nclose  of  each  participating  government's  fiscal  year.  The  audit  opinion  will  include  (i)  an \nassessment  of  the  adequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  regarding  project \nexpenditures and transactions to ensure the safe custody of project-financed assets; (ii) a \ndetermination  as  to  whether  the  Government,  the  PCU,  and  participating  provinces  have \nmaintained  adequate  documentation  for  all  financial  transactions,  specifically  including \nstatement of expenditure and imprest account procedures; and (iii) confirmation of compliance \nwith the project financial management system and ADB requirements for project management.  \n \n53.  The PIUs will submit quarterly reports and data to their PCU within 15 days of the end of \neach quarter. Each PCU will (i) collect and consolidate all project progress reports, site reports, \ntechnical reports, and financial reports and (ii) prepare quarterly progress reports within 30 days of \nthe end of each quarter and submit them to ADB. The quarterly reports will include (i) a narrative \ndescription  of  progress  made  during  the  reporting  period;  (ii)  modifications,  if  any,  to  the \nimplementation schedule; (iii) details of land use and resettlement; (iv) information on preparing \nand implementing initial environmental examinations (IEEs); (v) progress on the implementation of \nthe gender action plan and the ethnic minority development framework; (vi) major project activities \nby the PCU, PIUs, and training institutions; (vii) financial and procurement-related information; (viii) \nproblems experienced and remedial actions proposed; (ix) the work to be carried out during the \nupcoming reporting period; (x) progress on the grant or loan covenants, and (xi) a summary of \nexpenditures during the quarter, year-to-date expenditures, and total expenditures. Each PCU will \nsubmit to ADB, within 3 months of project completion, a project completion report that will cover the \ndetails of project implementation, achievement of outputs and outcome, compliance with covenants, \nimplementation of environmental and social safeguards, and other information that ADB may \nrequest. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n54.  A comprehensive project performance monitoring system (PPMS) has been prepared. A \nset of PPMS indicators have been developed. The PPMS will be integrated into the information \nmanagement system of the NTOs and the provincial tourism departments so that the monitoring \nof  social  and  economic  benefits  can  continue  after  project  completion.  The  PIUs  in  each \nprovince  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  PPMS  is  implemented  and  updated,  in \nconsultation with the local communities, to (i) examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) \nevaluate the delivery of planned facilities, (iii) assess the achievement of project outputs and \noutcome, (iv) ensure compliance with social safeguards, and (v) measure project benefits. \nAnnual PPMS reports will be prepared by each PIU, consolidated by the PCUs, and submitted \nto  ADB.  The  integrated  system  for  managing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  project  impacts, \noutcome, and outputs accords with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Monitoring System Handbook. \n \n55.  Project  outputs  will  be  monitored  in  the  regular  course  of  the  Project  in  terms  of \nefficiency (quantities delivered, people trained, and meetings) and effectiveness (quality of the \ngoods and services delivered). The PPMS will generate data on the immediate effects and the \nbroader impacts of project investments on socioeconomic development, poverty reduction, and \n ", "18 \nthe degree to which women and vulnerable groups participate and benefit. A baseline survey \nwill be carried out in selected communities in each province at the start of activities. Data \ncollection will be organized by the PIUs through villages and communes and will be stored in a \ndatabase maintained by the PIUs and PCUs. A monitoring and evaluation expert will provide \nguidelines and training on the design and maintenance of these databases. Monitoring data and \nindicators will be disaggregated, where possible, by sex, ethnicity, and income. In addition to the \nnormal PPMS, an individual consultant will be recruited in each country for external benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation, thereby independently assessing project effectiveness. The PCUs \nwill  appoint  an  independent  external  monitor  acceptable  to  ADB  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (LAR).  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n56.  The NTOs and ADB will conduct joint project reviews at least twice a year and a \ncomprehensive project review about 30 months after loan effectiveness. The comprehensive \nproject review will evaluate the (i) the actual progress toward achieving the project outputs in \neach  province,  (ii)  implementation  procedures,  (iii)  feedback  from  PPMS  activities,  (iv) \nfunctioning and performance of the PCUs and PIUs, (v) performance of consultants, and (vi) \nfinancial performance and cost recovery of tourism subprojects.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n57.  Social  Benefits  and  Beneficiaries.  Improved  tourism-related  infrastructure  brings \nsocial benefits to local residents and tourists. The Project will directly benefit 60,000 people: \n35,000 in the Lao PDR and 25,000 in Viet Nam. An estimated 145,000 people in the Lao PDR \nand 155,000 people in Viet Nam will be indirect beneficiaries. The pro-poor, community-based, \nsupply-chain tourism subprojects under output 2 are expected to benefit the largest number of \npoor households. The Project will improve the quality of tourism SME\u2019s operations and public \nofficials\u2019 pro-poor planning and management. About 180 master trainers, 400 trainers, and 800 \ngovernment officials working in tourism-related institutions will be trained, of which 40% will be \nwomen and 30% will be from participating provinces and districts with a high percentage of \nethnic minority residents. Human resource development, especially for trainers of personnel \nworking in tourism SMEs, will improve the quality of service and the competitiveness of the \nsector  and  provide  new  employment  opportunities  and  higher  salaries  for  trainers  and \nemployees. The pro-poor, community-based tourism subprojects will involve poor communities \nin the tourism economy while protecting ethnic minority cultures and minimizing the adverse \nimpacts of tourism, especially on vulnerable groups such as women, youths and the elderly. It \nwill provide local communities with alternative means of livelihood to supplement their income. \nThe  Project  will  train  village  guides  employed  by  tour  companies  as  cultural  and  nature \ninterpreters,  assist  communities  in  setting  up  income-earning  home-stays  and  community \nlodges, support producers of handicrafts to improve their quality and techniques for selling to \ntourists, and support  traditional arts and cultural performances. \n \n58.  Economic Benefits. Economic analysis has been undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines, including Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997), Handbook for \nIntegrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects, and Guidelines for \nIntegrating Risk Analysis in the Economic Analysis of Projects. The analyses included examining \nalternatives and least-cost analysis of project development options. Calculations of the economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  and  sensitivity  analyses  have  been  undertaken  for  the  four \nsubprojects under output 1, a sample pro-poor tourism development subproject under output 2, \nand the NSEC under output 3. The analysis found that the EIRRs for the six subprojects range \nfrom 16.6% for the pro-poor tourism subproject to 22.8% for the subproject in Phang Nha Ke ", "  19\nBang. The EIRRs are more sensitive to reductions in the number of tourists than to increases in \ncosts, but all subprojects remain reasonably robust. Developing tourism corridors will create \neconomic opportunities for local communities located along them to establish tourism enterprises, \nlengthen the time tourists spend in the subregion, and generate jobs. Governments will be able to \ncollect more taxes that can be used to improve community facilities and services. The improved \ninfrastructure required for tourism can be used by local residents, and tourism can stimulate the \nexpansion  of  such  economic  activities  as  fishing,  farming,  handicraft  production,  and  other \nmanufacturing. Tourism stimulates the development of new and improved cultural and commercial \nfacilities that can be used by local residents and tourists. Increased tourism will provide financial \nresources for the conservation of important natural areas, historical sites, and cultural traditions \nand arts. The Project will raise the service standards of personnel in small-scale hospitality \nestablishments in the participating countries that will make the tourism industry more competitive. \n \n59.  Financial Benefits. Financial analysis has been undertaken for the four subprojects \nunder output 1 and for the NSEC under output 3, based on the least-cost options identified in \nthe economic analysis. The analysis sought to assess if the subprojects can generate sufficient \nrevenues from entrance fees or user charges and retain them to pay for the O&M of project \nfacilities to ensure their financial sustainability. Cost-recovery mechanisms under the Project \ninclude the establishment or expansion of entrance fees to three of the subprojects (Siphandone, \nPhang Nha Ke Bang, and Bac Kan) and sites along the NSEC, as well as an environmental fee \nfor tourists staying in Vang Vieng town. From 2012, the subprojects will impose or increase the \nfees. It is conservatively assumed that demand between 2016 and 2020 will not increase over \nthat of 2015. The analysis concluded that the subprojects will generate sufficient income from \ntourists to pay for the O&M of the facilities and obtain modest surpluses, which can be invested \nin the project sites. Sensitivity analyses prepared for each project concluded that cash flows are \nmore sensitive to a reduction in the number of tourists than to an increase in O&M costs.  \n \n60.  Environmental  Impacts. The Project is classified as environment category B. It is \ndesigned to improve residents\u2019 quality of life and the physical environment. IEEs were prepared \nfor each of the two subprojects under output 1 for each country. IEEs for the likely interventions \nunder  components  2  and  3  were  prepared  for  each  country.  Because  infrastructure \ninterventions  will  be  small,  the  likely  environmental  impacts  will  be  temporary,  minor,  and \nlocalized. They can be minimized to acceptable levels with mitigation measures and monitoring \nprograms identified in the IEEs. Environmental mitigation measures requiring action by the \ncontractors will be incorporated into contracts for civil works. Environmental assessment and \nreview frameworks (EARF) were prepared for each country to provide adequate guidance for \nPCUs and PIUs in screening subprojects, determine appropriate mitigation for any negative \nimpacts identified, and implement environmental management and monitoring during project \nimplementation and beyond. For small-scale infrastructure interventions to be identified under \ncomponents 2 and 3, a cluster of IEEs will be prepared for each participating province to \ndocument the screening results of all interventions. If any of the screening results indicate a \nneed for further environmental analysis, individual IEEs will be prepared for each intervention \nthat requires further analysis and submitted to ADB for review prior to awarding the civil works \ncontract. A summary IEE for the Lao PDR is in Appendix 13. The summary IEE for Viet Nam, all \nremaining IEEs, and the EARFs are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n61.  Resettlement Impacts. Efforts have been made to minimize and, where possible, avoid \nLAR.  However,  minimal  LAR  with  relatively  small  impacts  is  required:  relocating  a  few \nhouseholds, temporarily relocating businesses, and using public land for the construction of \nsmall  markets,  parking  lots,  covered  bus  stops,  river  landings  and  stairs,  cultural  and \ninterpretation centers, refreshment stands, walkways, footbridges, toilets with water supply, \nticket booths, lodges, prayer pavilions, and signage. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement, resettlement frameworks for each \n ", "20 \nparticipating  country  and  short  resettlement  plans  for  the  subprojects  in  the  Siphandone \nWetland (Lao PDR) and Phong Nga Khe Bang (Viet Nam) have been prepared based on an \ninventory of losses and socioeconomic surveys, including focus-group discussions with affected \npeople and provincial authorities. One household will lose about 900 square meters of land to \nthe subproject in Phong Nga Khe Bang National Park, and the subproject in the Siphadone \nWetland will temporarily affect 28 stall owners and require three households to be relocated. \nAffected people will be compensated for their losses at full replacement cost at current market \nprices and provided with transition allowances and rehabilitation. Additional support will be \nextended  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable  and  female-headed  households.  The  resettlement \nframeworks will guide planning for any unforeseen LAR during project implementation. An \ninternational resettlement consultant for each country will build capacity in the PCUs and PIUs. \nThe summary resettlement plan and framework is in Appendix 14. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n62.  Market Risks. Project benefits will depend on the number of tourists visiting the sites, \nwhich  could  fall  in  response  to  weak  marketing  strategies;  low  quality  of  service;  site \ndeterioration from weak O&M; or external factors such as epidemics, terror attacks, or natural \ndisasters. To mitigate these risks, (i) tourism demand analyses and projections were prepared \nusing conservative assumptions and tourism surveys at project sites; (ii) each agency in charge \nof  the  O&M  of  facilities  will  prepare  and  maintain  a  business  plan  for  risk  management, \nespecially regarding market demand; and (iii) marketing and promotion for each subproject will \nhelp meet demand targets.  \n \n63.  Project  Implementation  Risks.  These  include  delays  in  implementation  and  cost \noverruns.  They  can  result  from  weak  planning,  management,  administrative  capability,  or \nprocedures. These risks have been mitigated by developing clearly defined and standardized \nprocedures  and  providing  significant  technical  support  and  training  to  the  implementing \nagencies during implementation. The risk of cost overruns has been mitigated through careful \nand detailed cost estimation based on the experience of the MTDP.  \n \n64.  Social  and  Environmental  Risks.  Uncontrolled  tourism  development  can  cause \ncongestion,  pollution,  the  illegal  trafficking  of  people,  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  the \ndeterioration of destinations. Over-commercialization of cultural traditions may degrade cultural \nheritage  and  the  cultural  identity of  small  ethnic  groups.  To  minimize  these  risks,  tourism \nplanning and management plans for each of the subprojects, based on careful assessment of \ncarrying capacity, will be prepared and monitored through the PPMS, while assessments and \nspecific actions will be implemented to ensure that ethnic groups/minorities benefit from, and \nare not disadvantaged by, tourism. Environmental analysis and management plans have been \nprepared.  Taking  into  account  the  balance  of  benefits  against  the  identified  risks  and \napproaches to mitigation, benefits are expected to outweigh costs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n65.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  participating  countries  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n66.

If \nthere  is  any  discrepancy  between  the  respective  government\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nrequirements will apply. They will ensure that the design, construction, operation \nand implementation of each subproject will be carried out in accordance with the \nIEEs  and  the  EARFs,  prepared  and  approved  by  each  of  the  participating \n ", "22 \ncountries\u2019 governments. Any adverse environmental impacts arising from the \nconstruction, operation and implementation of the subprojects will be minimized \nby implementing the environmental mitigation and management measures, and \nother  recommendations  specified  in  IEE.  Each  of  the  participating  countries\u2019 \ngovernments will ensure environmental requirements are incorporated in bidding \ndocuments and contracts for works. \n(viii)  Each of the participating countries\u2019 governments will ensure that the Project will \nbe implemented in accordance with its respective government\u2019s applicable laws \nand regulations on indigenous peoples and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998) and will carry out the specific measures on indigenous peoples stipulated \nin  the  agreed  ethnic  groups/minorities  development  frameworks  (EGMDFs), \nattached as Appendix 7. Each of the participating countries\u2019 governments will \nfurther ensure that indigenous peoples have equitable opportunities to participate \nin  training,  recruitment,  income  generation  activities  under  the  Project.  The \nEGMDFs will be monitored as part of the overall system for the Project, and \nsocioeconomic data will be disaggregated by sex and by ethnicity. Progress \nreports will provide periodic updates on the effect of the Project on ethnic groups. \n \n67.  Conditions applicable to the Lao PDR are as follows: \n(i)  Within 12 months of ADB grant effectiveness, the Government will ensure that \nthe local government of Vang Vieng will issue district regulations, acceptable to \nADB, on sanitation requiring, among others (a) connecting sewage rains and \nseptic  tanks  to  drains  in  high  and  medium  density  areas,  and  to  drains  or \nproperly designed and constructed soakaways in low density areas; (b) providing \na septic tank that meets prescribed standards in each household or business \nlocated in high and medium density areas; and (c) providing on-site treatment \nfacilities in hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and industrial enterprises to treat their \nwastewater. \n(ii)  Within 36 months of ADB grant effectiveness, the Government will ensure that \nthe local government of Vang Vieng will prepare and implement a mechanism to \nensure that public assets such as roads, drainage and solid waste management \ncan generate sufficient revenues.

The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS): \nMekong Tourism Development Project (MTDP) and other projects undertaken in the subregion \nsuch as the Luxembourg Development-supported Strengthening the Hospitality and Tourism \nSector Programme in Viet Nam and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural \nOrganization-Lao National Tourism Administration (LNTA) Nam Ha Ecotourism Project in the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) are rich sources of lessons that have been \nincorporated in the design of the Sustainable Tourism Development Project (the Project).  \n \n2.  The main lessons concerning project coordination, management, implementation, and \nadministration are the following: \n(i)  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  subregional  project  steering  committee, \nnational  project  steering  committee,  project  coordination  units  (PCUs),  and \nproject implementation units (PIUs) need to be clearly defined. \n(ii)  Five-year indicative work plans and 6-month detailed work plans and budgets at \nthe subproject level should be prepared and approved upon project inception. \n(iii)  Biannual planning meetings must be organized between the PCU and each PIU \nto review project progress, achievements, and any need to modify the original \nplan, as well as to plan for the next semester. The meeting should be chaired by \na senior member of the Executing Agency to ensure that there is political support \nand an understanding of the project among senior decision makers nationally \nand provincially. \n(iv)  The 6-month action plans of the Project should be given priority funding in a \nflexible  approval  framework  to  ensure  strong  counterpart  commitment  and \nmorale and momentum in project implementation. \n(v)  Clear and effective project implementation planning and reporting systems and \nforms in the local language need to be developed at the beginning of the Project. \n(vi)  A manual of procedures for administering small contracts and a standardized \ncontract format acceptable to ADB and the government of each participating \ncountry needs to be prepared. \n(vii)  In the PCU and PIUs, a finance officer and an accountant should be contracted \nand  given  adequate  training  to  ensure  that  financial  reporting  to  ADB  and \nnational governments is properly managed. \n(viii)  Training  on  project  procedures,  especially  financial  management,  should  be \nprovided to PCUs and PIUs. Follow-up audits and refresher courses conducted \nby an international or national consultant familiar with ADB and government \nfinancial procedures should be undertaken throughout the course of the Project. \n(ix)  A communications plan to publicize the project outcome and outputs to other \nstakeholders and the public in general should be developed during the first 6 \nmonths of the project and implemented as part of the project\u2019s awareness-raising \nactivities. \n(x)  The Project should actively seek partnerships with other development partners, \nand standard agreements should be prepared in advance and incorporated into \nthe implementation plan of the Project and manuals of procedures. \n(xi)  Leaders of national tourism organizations should establish a mentoring program \nwhere experienced staffers partner with junior staffers to teach them how to \neffectively manage large, donor-financed projects. \n(xii)  Well-defined job descriptions and wide advertising of PCU and PIU positions \nshould be prepared to ensure that competent people are recruited to fill project \npositions.  Additional  financial  compensation  for  counterpart  staff  should  be \nprovided as an incentive. \n ", "Appendix 3  31\n(xiii)  Attention needs to be paid to recruiting international consultants that can work \neffectively in the environment and culture of the participating countries. Detailed \nterms of reference with clearly defined job and ideal candidate descriptions need \nto be prepared. \n(xiv)  The selection of pro-poor tourism interventions for assistance should adhere to a \nset of criteria that includes the development of tourist attractions, tour circuits, \nand value chain interventions. \n(xv)  To avoid spreading resources too thin, the Project should aim to develop one \nmodel suite of pro-poor interventions in each participating province that includes \nthe development of a tour site that can be operated by the local community, a \ntour circuit that is operated as a public-private-community partnership, and one \nvalue chain intervention. \n(xvi)  The  Project  should  promote  the  establishment  of  provincial  inbound  tour \noperators to raise the number of distribution outlets that develop and market local \ntour circuits and destinations.  \n(xvii)  To ensure that local people retain ownership of tourism resources and have \naccess  to  income-generating  opportunities,  the  Project  should  work  with \ncommunities  and  government  authorities  to  train  and  allow  local  people  to \noperate tourist attractions under formal management agreements or community \nconcessions. \n(xviii)  To  help  the  PIUs,  communities,  and  local  authorities  establish  community-\nconcessions,  the  Project  should  develop  a  set  of  standard  procedures  and \nguidelines for doing so. \n(xix)  When  communities  operate  tourist  attractions  under  formal  management \nagreements, community concessions, or public-private-community partnerships, \nmechanisms  must  be  in  place  to  ensure  that  a  portion  of  financial  benefits \nreaches the poorest members of the community. Some ways to accomplish this \nare to provide an annual dividend payments to each family or direct a portion of \ntourism  revenues  into  village  funds  that  can  be  accessed  by  the  entire \ncommunity. \n(xx)  Encouraging international and domestic investors to construct nature resorts in \nremote areas creates employment opportunities for the poor and demand for \nagricultural products, handicrafts, labor, building materials, transportation, and \nother tourism-related services that the poor can provide. The Project should \nactively promote this type of investment. \n(xxi)  Pro-poor  tourism  subprojects  require  substantial  investments  in  awareness \nraising, training, capacity building, and marketing and promotion. The Project \nshould allocate a significant portion of resources to these tasks. \n(xxii)  Approaches to sustainable tourism development that are gender sensitive and \ninclusive of ethnic groups, youths, and the disadvantaged should be set out in a \nstrategy and mainstreamed into project activities by a dedicated social specialist \nin each PIU. \n(xxiii)  The  project  must  allocate  adequate  resources  to  implement  a  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system that allows the PCUs and PIUs to identify and \ncorrect mistakes as well as gather information on successful initiatives that can \nbe communicated to senior decision makers and the public at large. \n ", "32   Appendix 4 \nSUBPROJECTS\u2019 SELECTION CRITERIA \n \n1.  The  Sustainable  Tourism  Development  Project  (the  Project)  employs  two  sets  of \nselection and evaluation criteria: (i) one set used during project preparation to select the current \nlist of subprojects under the project outputs and (ii) another set to be used during project \nimplementation to (a) prioritize the demonstration subprojects under outputs 2 and 3; (b) select \ntraining institutions for implementing output 4; and (c) chose the group of master trainers, \ntrainers of trainers, and public officials to receive training in output 4.  \n \nA.  Selection and Evaluation Criteria During Project Preparation \n \n2.  During project preparation, a set of selection criteria was applied to a long list of more \nthan  120  candidate  subprojects.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  the  criteria  helped  to  prioritize  the  two \nsubprojects selected under output 1, six provinces under output 2, and the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) north\u2013south and east\u2013west economic corridors under output 3. In Viet Nam, \nthe criteria helped to prioritize two subprojects under output 1, five provinces under output 2, \nand the GMS east\u2013west economic corridor under output 3. The criteria also helped to prioritize \ntwo training programs for both the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam \nunder output 4.  \n \nB.  Selection and Evaluation Criteria During Project Implementation \n \n3.  Pro-Poor, Community-Based, Supply-Chain Tourism Subproject Sites. The Project \nwill select a complimentary combination of pro-poor interventions in each province, including at \nleast (i) one standalone individual tourist attraction such as a waterfall, cave, or historic site; (ii) \none tour circuit such as a trekking route or tour; and (iii) one value chain involving a cluster of \nvillages producing goods and services such as agricultural goods or handicrafts. The estimated \ncost of infrastructure at each site shall be about $100,000 in the Lao PDR and $110,000\u2013\n$150,000 in Viet Nam. The infrastructure may include, but is not limited to, markets, viewing \npoints, walking trails and signage, information and visitor centers, access and parking, river \npiers, community lodges, sanitary facilities, and the development of natural sites within a pro-\npoor, community-based tourism-development framework. \n \n4.  The selection of sites will be determined by the following set of criteria:  \n(i)  The area should include a cluster of villages and communities in a district or \nprovince centered around a staging town as gateway and main dormitory.  \n(ii)  It shall be safe and secure from internal and external threats and dangers (e.g., \ngroup conflicts, unexploded ordnance, etc.). \n(iii)  It should be accessible by an existing road within 5 km, which may require a \nsmall investment for minor upgrading to enhance access.  \n(iv)  It should include many people living below the poverty line, especially in small \nand/or minority communities.  \n(v)  It should have a mix of natural and cultural tourism attractions of strong interest \nto tourist markets.  \n(vi)  An existing flow of tourists should already exist, which can be enhanced with \nmodest interventions and generate substantial additional income.  \n(vii)  Strong and proven market demand should exist for the type of product that will \nbe developed.  \n(viii)  Tourist attractions should include many local community stakeholders whose \ntourist-hosting skills require strengthening.  \n(ix)  Agencies in charge should have capacity to implement and operate the Project.  \n(x)  Consent and agreement should be reached with participating communities to \nenter into a joint-management contract for operating and managing the site once \nit is developed. \n ", "Appendix 4  33\n(xi)  Strong support and commitment must come from key stakeholders (e.g., local \ncommunities, tourism and related agencies, private tour operators and carriers, \nand development partners and nongovernment organizations).  \n(xii)  Cost-recovery mechanisms for recurrent operating costs should be in place, or \nthere should be a clear willingness to put them in place.  \n(xiii)  No significant land acquisition or resettlement should be required, in accordance \nwith the land acquisition and resettlement framework for the Project.1  \n(xiv)  No relocation of small or minority villages should be required, in accordance with \nthe country-specific ethnic minority development framework for the Project. \n(xv)  No  significant  environmental  impacts  are  associated  with  the  intervention  in \naccordance with the Project\u2019s environmental assessment and review framework.  \n \n5.  These criteria will be used for screening and is complemented by a number of other \nevaluating steps, especially local communities\u2019 willingness to participate. Some of the steps are \nhighlighted in the detailed project description and implementation manual in Supplementary \nAppendix G.  \n \n6.  GMS Tourism Corridor Subproject Sites. Subprojects sites along the north\u2013south \neconomic corridor (NSEC) and east\u2013west economic corridor (EWEC) may include, but are not \nlimited to, markets, viewing points, walking trails and signage, information and visitor centers, \naccess and parking, river piers, community lodges, sanitary facilities, and the development of \nnatural sites. The sites will be selected according to of the following criteria:  \n(i)  Small-scale  improvements  (e.g.,  scenic  viewpoints)  shall  be  done  along  the \nNSEC and EWEC to enhance tourist attractions or shall be adjacent to both \neconomic corridors (i.e., within 10 km of the main road along an existing access \nroad).  The  total  number  of  improvements  along  the  NSEC  and  EWEC  is \nundefined, but the cost for each small-scale infrastructure improvement shall not \nexceed $150,000 in the Lao PDR or $180,000 in Viet Nam. \n(ii)  The area shall be safe and secure from internal and external threats and dangers \n(e.g., group conflicts, unexploded ordnance, etc.). \n(iii)  Agencies in charge of the site should have the capacity to implement and operate \nthe Project.  \n(iv)  Strong support and commitment should come from key stakeholders (e.g., local \ncommunities, tourism and related agencies, private tour operators and carriers, \nand development partners and nongovernment organizations).  \n(v)  Consent and agreement must be obtained from the ministry responsible for road \noperations and maintenance to develop roadside viewing points and construct \ncommon signage along the NSEC and EWEC. \n(vi)  No significant land acquisition or resettlement should be required, in accordance \nwith the land acquisition and resettlement framework for the Project.2 \n(vii)  No relocation of any small or minority village should be required for tourism \ndevelopment, in accordance with the ethnic minorities development framework \nfor the Project.  \n(viii)  No significant environmental impacts associated with the intervention should be \nrequired, in accordance with the Project\u2019s environmental assessment and review \nframework. \n \n7.  Selection of the Training Institution. Two training institutions will be selected in each \ncountry under output 4 by the consultant qualification selection procedure. One will train master \n                                                 \n1  Fewer than 200 people will experience major impacts, which are defined as being physically displaced from \nhousing or losing 10% or more of their income-generating assets. This is the threshold applied for the entire output, \ncontaining up to 2\u20133 sites per province (total of about 15 sites). \n2  Major impacts are defined in footnote 2. The threshold is applied for the entire output, containing up to seven sites \nalong the NSEC and one site along the EWEC in the  Lao PDR and ten sites along the EWEC in Viet Nam. \n ", "34   Appendix 4 \ntrainers and trainers of trainers in small-scale tourism and hospitality operation, while the other \nwill train public officials in pro-poor tourism planning and management. A set of criteria has been \ndeveloped and will be refined during implementation by the human resource development \nspecialist. The training institution shall  \n(i)  be an existing vocational training and education institution in the Lao PDR or Viet \nNam with at least 5 years of demonstrated experience in delivering training \nprograms in tourism development;  \n(ii)  have  sufficient  classrooms,  accommodation,  staff,  and  teaching  facilities  to \ndeliver the specified training and demonstrate its commitment to improving the \nquality of its training facilities and programs to accommodate the human resource \ndevelopment output for this Project;  \n(iii)  be one of the GMS tourism training and education institutions and/or be willing to \naccommodate interested trainees from other GMS countries;  \n(iv)  be accessible to all participating project provinces; \n(v)  have a partnership with an international training institution, if necessary, which \nwill help train the master trainers in English; and  \n(vi)  have demonstrated its ability to manage training courses in English. \n \n8.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Project will support pro-poor and environmentally and socially sustainable tourism development. It supports Viet \nNam\u2019s 5-year socioeconomic development plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010 and the comprehensive poverty reduction and \ngrowth strategy. The strategies aim for sustained annual growth of 7.5%, the elimination of hunger by 2010, and the \nhalving of poverty from 2002 to 2010. Sustainable growth, inclusive social development, good governance, and \nregional cooperation in the GMS are the main priorities, and tourism is emerging as a key sector for achieving them. \nIn the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy \n(NGPES) lists tourism as a key sector supporting growth. Cross-sector priorities include gender, information, culture, \npopulation, social security, and capacity building, all key activities of the Project. The NGPES aims to reduce the \npercentage of poor households to 15%. \n \nIn the GMS regional cooperation strategy and program 2007\u20132009, the four key strategic pillars are (i) strengthening \nconnectivity  and  facilitating  cross-border  movement  and  tourism;  (ii)  integrating  national  markets  to  promote \neconomic efficiency and private sector development; (iii) addressing health and other social, economic, and capacity-\nbuilding issues; and (iv) managing the environment and shared natural resources to help ensure sustainable \ndevelopment and the conservation of natural resources. The Project is closely aligned with all four pillars. ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010a is directly linked to supporting the SEDP\u2019s targeted \noutcomes. Support will be directed toward achieving social equity and improving environmental management. \nPromoting regional cooperation and gender development is key. The CSP 2007\u20132011 for the Lao PDRb focuses on \nsustainable economic growth, accelerating progress in non-income Millennium Development Goal (MDGs), building \ncapacity for good governance, and promoting regional cooperation and integration. \n \nIn line with ADB country strategies, the Project seeks to contribute directly to poverty reduction by locating its \nactivities in tourist-attracting subproject sites with high levels of poverty. It promotes regional cooperation and poverty \nreduction in the GMS by developing and implementing models for sustainable and pro-poor tourism development. As \nindicated in the GMS tourism sector strategy 2006\u20132015, there is an urgent need to demonstrate more effective \napproaches for the sustainable use and development of natural and cultural tourism assets and spread the benefits \nof tourism more widely through pro-poor tourism initiatives. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-G) \n1. Key Issues \nViet Nam. Viet Nam\u2019s recent progress in socioeconomic development has been remarkable. Poverty was cut from \n58.1% in 1993 to 19.5% in 2005. During this period, income per capita grew from $288 to $622, with only a modest \nincrease in income disparities. Broad-based economic growth, greater macroeconomic and political stability, and \ntargeted programs for poor and vulnerable groups have helped reduce poverty. However, while income inequality \nhas increased only marginally, significant pockets of poverty remain. Households whose consumption is just over the \npoverty line are vulnerable to external shocks and remain at risk of falling back below the poverty line.  \n \nTourism is a key sector of the Vietnamese economy. It is expected to grow at over 16% per year, contributing $4.75 \nbillion to national GDP and employing 1.2 million people by 2010. This diverse and labor-intensive industry presents \nenormous opportunities for poverty reduction. In 2006, tourism receipts reached $2.4 billion (3.9% of total GDP), up \nfrom $1.2 billion in 2000. The tourism sector employs 250,000 people directly, and 500,000 people work in tourism-\nrelated businesses and industries. An expanding tourism industry will generate many jobs and provide opportunities \nfor labor to shift away from unproductive agricultural towards services, creating opportunity, achieving higher \ndisposable incomes, and reducing poverty. \n \nLao PDR. The Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the Asia and Pacific region. Per capita GDP is $490, and \none third of the population is poor. A small domestic market, the subsistence nature of the rural economy, skills \nshortages, and the remoteness and isolation of much of the population are among the factors constraining growth \nand poverty reduction. However, the economy has grown and diversified in the past 5 years, as the Lao PDR tapped \nits natural resource base for hydropower, mining, and tourism. The incidence of poverty fell from 46% to 33% \nbetween 1992 and 2003. Tourism is recognized as a key contributor to income generation and poverty reduction.  \n \nWhile the Lao PDR is on track in terms of meeting the income MDGs by 2015, income poverty continues to be \nproblem in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty is twice as high as in urban areas. Some 75% of poor \nhouseholds are in ethnic groups living in remote and upland areas on marginally productive land. These groups \n ", "36   Appendix 5 \nsuffer high rates of infant and maternal mortality; low access to health and education services, electricity, and clean \nwater; high illiteracy; and limited involvement in the market economy. Remoteness and variation in access to basic \ninfrastructure are key reasons for the unequal regional distribution of poverty.  \n \nThe project area covers the poorest provinces in the two countries, and an estimated 30% of project beneficiaries in \nViet Nam and 44% in the Lao PDR are poor. Since these areas are prime tourist locations, there is great potential for \nthe Project to reduce the high poverty incidence and contribute to economic growth. \n \n2. Design Features \nThe Project will contribute to achieving the objective of the GMS tourism sector strategy of reducing poverty through \nsustainable tourism development by (i) improving livelihoods in poor rural areas with tourism potential and (ii) \nfacilitating pro-poor tourism development and designing and implementing pro-poor demonstration projects and \nsystems that can be replicated in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and other GMS countries. The poorest people in the Project \nareas  will  benefit  significantly  from  project  interventions  through  expanded  tourism-related  opportunities,  the \ngeneration of new employment opportunities, the development of community ownership and self-reliance, reduced \nsocial and health risks through awareness programs, and a sustainable environment.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s pro-poor tourism-development activities include traditional community-based tourism development \napproaches combined with new supply chain initiatives. The Project will develop models throughout Viet Nam and \nthe Lao PDR to demonstrate ways to involve poor communities in the tourism economy and will aim to protect ethnic \ncultures and minimize the adverse impacts of tourism. The human resource development component will have a pro-\npoor focus and include training on developing and managing small-scale tourism interventions in poor areas and \ntargeted capacity development for trainers from poor households and ethnic minorities. \n \nTourism offers new opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups. Increases in the number and duration of tourist \nvisits derived from paved footpaths, improved drainage, visitor information centers and comfort facilities, signage, \nand trained local guides will provide poor local residents with enhanced opportunities to produce food and other \nservices for hotels and restaurants; set up their own stalls, eateries, and home stays; serve as construction workers \nand trekking and tourist guides; produce and sell handicrafts; improve their credit, accounting, and marketing skills; \nand hold traditional cultural  performances for visitors. Local communities will be encouraged to work out ways to \nmanage and eventually collectively own their scenic resources.  \n \nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nViet Nam. Viet Nam has made good progress in achieving the MDGs and the Viet Nam Development Goals. It has \nalready achieved its poverty targets, halving income poverty and largely eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. \nGood progress has been made in improving access to primary education, gender equality, maternal health, and \naccess to safe drinking water. Despite these achievements, increased efforts will be required to improve the quality \nof key services, target pockets of poverty, and ensure sound and environmentally sustainable practices. \n \nAlthough economic growth has benefited most of society, some groups have benefited less than others. The \nincidence of poverty remains much higher in rural areas (26.4%) than urban areas (13.7%). Food poverty has been \nlargely eliminated in urban households (3.3%), but 8.1% of rural households remain food-poor. Sixty-one percent of \nethnic minority households lived below the poverty line in 2002, compared with 14% of the Kinh and Chinese \nhouseholds. Ethnic minority children are less educated because of poor infrastructure and accessibility, language \nand cultural barriers, problems in attracting good teachers to remote areas, and curriculum irrelevance.  \n \nLao PDR. The Lao PDR lags behind on a number of non-income MDGs, as life expectancy at birth is low (61 years), \nchild malnutrition is high (30%), and rates of infant mortality (60 per 1,000 live births) and maternal mortality (350 per \n100,000 live births) are very high compared with other countries in the region. The Lao PDR is the lowest-ranking \nEast Asian country on the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Human Development Index. One third of the \nadult population, and nearly half of all females, cannot read or write, and just 14% of the population has completed \nprimary school. However, the Government is committed to accelerating improvement in social indicators, and human \nresource development has been accorded the highest priority in the SEDP. \n \nThe 2006 surveys conducted in project preparatory technical assistance show that food insecurity, lack of access to \nsocial infrastructure and services, low levels of education, gender inequalities, lack of ownership of productive \nresources, and poor access to social services and infrastructure are prevalent in the project areas. Women are \nparticularly vulnerable to trafficking, HIV/AIDS, and other risks. Tourism offers new sets of livelihood opportunities to \npoor people in food and livestock growing for tourist establishments, food and souvenir stalls, home stays, the \nmanufacture and sale of handicrafts, construction labor, repair services, guided trekking, and cultural performances \nthat retain the integrity of ethnic minorities. This Project builds on what people already know and expands their \nknowledge base and livelihood opportunities, making tourism activities technically feasible, while integrating new \nideas and tasks into people\u2019s indigenous systems through a participatory planning process.  \n ", "Appendix 5  37\nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. Consultation and participation process during the project preparation \n \nThe Project was designed using a highly participatory approach and included consultations with villagers on their \nsituation, participation in community activities and decision making, gender and ethnic minority issues, and tourism, \nas well as formal research instruments for quantitative and more intensive qualitative investigations. From August to \nOctober 2006, project teams carried out household surveys and focus group discussions. Key informant interviews \nwere conducted with village chiefs, heads of local associations, women\u2019s union representatives, shopkeepers, \nrestaurant owners, and others. The results were discussed with government, nongovernment organizations, and \nother participants at national workshops in Hanoi and Vientiane. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n  Information sharing          Consultation        Collaborative decision making        Empowerment  \n \n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?       Yes      No  \n \nA participation strategy is incorporated into the overall project design. The Project supports consultation and \ncoordination activities among various stakeholders in the tourism sector, including the executing agencies, other line \nministries, politicians, provinces, districts, villages, businesses, and community groups. Tourism community groups \nwill be established to oversee activities at the project sites. Participatory approaches will be at the core of the Project, \nand special provisions and budgets have been included to ensure the active participation of women, ethnic \nminorities, youths, and other vulnerable groups. This process will be regularly monitored and periodically evaluated \nthrough field research using household and community surveys, focus group discussions, participant observation, \nand key interviews. International and national consultants and project staff will carry out these tasks, with the results \nfed back into ongoing project implementation.   \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nViet Nam. A strong policy and institutional environment supporting gender equality has been instrumental in \nempowering Vietnamese women and reducing the gender gap. The National Committee for the Advancement of \nWomen is formally responsible for promoting gender equality. It is a high-level multisectoral committee that reports \ndirectly to the Prime Minister. The Vietnam Women\u2019s Union is a mass organization for women that facilitates the \nimplementation of local projects and programs, in addition to representing its members in national policy dialogue. \nThe newly issued Gender Equality Law (2007) provides leverage for addressing priority gender issues by redressing \ngender disparities in existing laws, calling for gender mainstreaming in public administration, and providing for \ntargets and quotas for women's participation in decision making.  \n \nLao PDR. Promoting gender equality is an important national goal of the Lao PDR, as reflected in the 1991 \nConstitution, the NGPES, the National SEDP, and a number of the country\u2019s international commitments. The \nNational Commission for the Advancement of Women-Lao PDR was established in 1991 to help ensure women\u2019s \nequal access to basic services and productive resources. It develops national strategies and reports directly to the \nGovernment, while the Lao Women\u2019s Union helps implementation on the ground. \n \nThe GMS tourism sector strategy calls for increased attention to gender development in the tourism sector, in which \nwomen are commonly employed by hotels and guesthouses, food service providers, bars, travel agencies, and tour \ncompanies. Women are also self-employed in preparing and selling food and providing accommodation. Handicrafts \nare an important sector in the rural economy, with production and sales dominated by women. In the formal sector, \nwomen are generally underrepresented in management but predominate in customer service and sanitation. \nExceptions are usually found in smaller, family-run businesses, which tend to have less rigid gender stereotyping in \nhiring. Self-employment through tourism thus offers women greater independence and control and has the potential \nto promote local development by reducing poverty, expanding women\u2019s educational opportunities, and increasing \ntheir self-confidence. At the same time, some initiatives may increase women\u2019s workloads with little recognition or \ncompensation, and their exposure to social risks such as trafficking may increase.  \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, including \naccess to and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making \nprocess: \n     Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nThe Project will particularly benefit women through increased employment opportunities and ensuring that women \nget an equitable share of educational and other socioeconomic opportunities produced by the tourism sector. The \nProject will increase opportunities in food production, handicrafts, ceremonial celebrations, and the management of \n ", "38   Appendix 5 \nsmall tourism sites, ensuring that women, who tend to be underrepresented in decision-making positions, are fully \nintegrated into the planning and implementation of subproject activities.  \n \nA gender action plan has been prepared to highlight the different needs of men and women in the tourism sector and \nto help ensure that men and women have equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from the Project. The plan is \nbased on a gender analysis that was prepared for the Project and builds on the experiences in the previous ADB-\nfunded Mekong Tourism Development Project, Vietnam Gender Assessment 2006, and Gender Assessment and \nStrategic Action Plan of the Tourism Sector in the Lao PDR. Key activities include ensuring that (i) mechanisms to \npromote women\u2019s representation in decision-making processes are established; (ii) women\u2019s needs are integrated \ninto project subcomponents; (iii) targets for female staff in project implementation are established; (iv) communities, \ngovernment officials, and other stakeholders are trained on gender issues and risks related to tourism; (v) awareness \nprograms related to HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, trafficking and other social risks for communities and \ngovernment officials are designed and implemented; (vi) women are effectively involved in project monitoring and \nevaluation, including gender-disaggregated data for these purposes; and (vii) at least 40% of capacity development \nand training activities and 50% of the scholarships for master trainers are reserved for women. \n \nIII.

A gender action plan has been prepared to highlight the different needs of men and \nwomen in the tourism sector and to help ensure that men and women have equal opportunity to \nparticipate in and benefit from the Sustainable Tourism Development Project (the Project). The \nplan is based on a gender analysis that was prepared for the Project and is designed according \nto the Policy on Gender and Development (1998) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It also \nbuilds on experiences in the previous ADB-funded Mekong Tourism Development Project, the \nVietnam Gender Assessment 2006, and the Gender Assessment and Strategic Action Plan of \nthe Tourism Sector in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Key activities include (i) \nmechanisms to promote women\u2019s representation in decision-making processes; (ii) ensuring \nthat women\u2019s needs are integrated into project subcomponents; (iii) establishing targets for \nfemale staff in project implementation; (iv) training communities, government officials, and other \nstakeholders on gender issues and risks related to tourism; (v) designing and implementing \nawareness programs for communities and government officials related to HIV/AIDS, sexually \ntransmitted diseases, trafficking, and other social risks; (vi) ensuring the effective involvement of \nwomen in project monitoring and evaluation, including gender-disaggregated data for these \npurposes; and (vii) ensuring that at least 40% of capacity development and training activities \nand 50% of the scholarships for master trainers are reserved for women. Gender analyses for \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L,  on  social  and  poverty \nassessment and strategies. \n \nA.  Key Issues: Gender in the Tourism Sector \n \n2.  In the tourism sector, women are mostly employed by hotels and guesthouses, food \nservice providers, bars, travel agencies, and tour companies. They are also self-employed in \npreparing and selling food and providing accommodation. Handicrafts are important in the rural \neconomy, with production and sales dominated by women, especially in textiles. In the formal \nsector, women are generally underrepresented in management but predominate in customer \nservice and sanitation. Exceptions are usually found in smaller, family-run businesses, which \ntend to have less rigid gender stereotyping.  \n \n3.  While women are increasingly able to take advantage of opportunities in tourism, they \nremain constrained by limited opportunities in business development and leadership. Ethnic \nminorities in the two countries, especially women, particularly lag in economic opportunities. In \nViet Nam, 87% of ethnic minority women in rural areas are self-employed in agriculture. Minority \nwomen face more constraints in access to capital, as they are less likely to own land or be \nliterate, and many poor women lack knowledge of business development, marketing, enterprise \nselection techniques, and simple accounting.  \n \n4.  Self-employment through tourism offers women, particularly those from ethnic groups, \ngreater independence and control. Tourism thus has the potential to boost local development by \nreducing poverty, expanding women\u2019s educational and employment opportunities, increasing \ntheir self-confidence, and ensuring more active involvement of marginalized groups through \nincreased demands for their skills in handicrafts, food preparation, and cultural performances.  \n \n5.  Tourism  development  may  increase  exposure  to  HIV/AIDS  and  other  diseases, \ntrafficking, and substance abuse resulting from higher number of tourists and cross-border \nmovements, especially along the north\u2013south and east\u2013west economic corridors. The potential \nnegative social impacts of tourism on such groups as women, children, the disabled, and \nminority communities are currently among the least addressed by the tourism sector. The \nProject will incorporate and specifically address these concerns to ensure a more socially \nresponsible pattern of tourism development that positively affects both men and women. \n ", "40   Appendix 6 \nB.

An ethnic groups/minorities development framework (EGMDF) has been prepared for \nthe  regional  Sustainable  Tourism  Development  Project  (the  Project)  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam. The purpose of the EGMDF is to (i) guide the \nassessment  of  potential  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  during  the  feasibility  study  for  each \nsubproject; (ii) assist the preparation of specific actions or the development of an ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan to address these impacts; and (iii) help improve the distribution of tourism \nbenefits among different groups of beneficiaries, especially the smaller ethnic groups. The \nEGMDF is based on (i) provincial and household surveys; (ii) four sample subprojects for output 1; \n(iii) consultations with ethnic minorities, government officials, and other key stakeholders; (iv) the \nprevious gender equity and ethnic diversity action plan for the Greater Mekong Subregion Mekong \nTourism  Development  Project  (Lao  PDR); 1  and  (v)  secondary  sources  and  past  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) projects. Supplementary Appendix M contains individual country ethnic \ngroups/minorities development frameworks. \n \nA.  Ethnic Groups/Minorities and Tourism Development  \n \n2.  Lao PDR. The Lao PDR has a population of 5.6 million, with 49 recognized ethnic groups \nand more than 200 ethnic subgroups. Ethnic groups fall into four broad ethno-linguistic categories: \nLao-Tai, Mon Khmer, Hmong-Iu Mien, and China-Tibet. Smaller ethnic groups live mainly in the \nnorthern uplands of the Lao PDR near the borders with Thailand, Myanmar, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and Viet Nam. They make up one-third of the population but constitute more than half of \nthe country\u2019s poor. About 32% of the total population lives below the poverty line\u201452.5% in the \nnorthern region, 34.9% in the central, and 38.4% in the southern.  \n3.  Viet Nam. Viet Nam had a population of 85.3 million in 2007, of which ethnic minorities \naccount for 14%. There are 54 officially recognized ethnic groups. About 53 ethnic minorities and \n100 subgroups live in the northern and central mountains and the lowland river deltas of Viet Nam. \nIn 2004, about 39% of all those living in poverty were from ethnic minorities. About 61% of all \nethnic minority people are poor (86% in 1993), compared with only 14% of the majority Kinh and \nChinese (56% in 1993).2 Ethnic minorities are generally poorer and more disadvantaged than the \nKinh and Chinese and have limited access to education and health care services. \n4.  Tourism potential is often the greatest in areas where smaller ethnic groups reside. \nTourism development brings a number of direct and indirect opportunities for ethnic minorities \nincluding (i) income generation and poverty alleviation, (ii) locally led planning and development, \n(iii) revitalized cultural industries and practices, (iv) better transport and communication, (v) \nincreased  disposable  income  for  better  education  and  health  services,  and  (vi)  better \ncommunication with authorities.  \n \n5.  Tourism development also has the potential to threaten local cultures and norms. Ethnic \ngroups/minorities often face constraints that prevent them from accessing the opportunities \nbrought about by tourism growth, such as remote villages and limited mobility, market access, \neducation,  and  familiarity  with  majority  languages.  Women  from  small  ethnic  groups  face \nadditional risks and increased demand on their time from tourism development (e.g., increasing \nthe risk of girls dropping out of school). Efforts to conserve and share ethnic culture with tourists \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Legal Framework and Principles \n6.  Country-specific ethnic groups/minorities development frameworks for the Project are \nbased on Lao and Vietnamese regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \nADB\u2019s policy aims to protect ethnic minorities from the adverse impacts of development and to \nensure that all ethnic groups benefit from development projects and programs.  \nC.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n7.  The EGMDF ensures that all ethnic groups/minorities share proportionately in project \nbenefits  and  experience  limited  adverse  effects.  The  implementation  arrangements  and \nestimated costs of the EGMDF are integrated into the overall arrangements and budget of the \nProject. During project implementation, demonstration subprojects will be prepared to include a \nsocioeconomic and demographic profile of target communities by ethnicity. Using ADB\u2019s checklist \non indigenous peoples, the potential effects of subprojects will be assessed for all ethnic groups. \nPotential impacts will be identified and measures to mitigate them will be incorporated into the \ndetailed design for each subproject. It is anticipated that ethnic minorities in the proposed project \nareas will benefit from the demonstration projects, which aim to use a sustainable, culturally and \nenvironmentally sound, pro-poor tourism approach.  \nTable A7.1: Anticipated Impacts and Proposed Actions on Ethnic Minorities in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam \n \n  Anticipated  Anticipated   \nProject  Positive Effect  Negative  Proposed Actions to Mitigate Impacts \nOutput  Effect \nOutput 1: Model sustainable tourism development projects protecting the environment and cultural heritage \ndeveloped \n\u25cf Biodiversity  \u25cf Minor/none:  \u25cf None   \u25cf Include ethnic groups in community planning for income \nprotection at  Few ethnic    generation and asset management in tourism. \nthe  minorities in the    \u25cf Separate budget lines included for (i) screening potential \nSiphandone  community    impacts on ethnic groups, mitigating impacts, managing risks, \nWetland (Lao    and  developing  enhancement  measures;  (ii)  a  public \nPDR)    awareness program, and (iii) M&E activities disaggregated by \n  sex, ethnicity, and income where possible. \n\u25cf Consult with small ethnic communities during subproject \npreparation and before the start of construction. \n\u25cf Visitor information and interpretation facilities in Nakasang \nvillage feature cultural  and  livelihood  information on  ethnic \ngroups from the wetland and follow local architectural design. \n\u25cf Capacity-development and livelihood-support programs cater \nto the needs of the local ethnic groups (e.g., handicrafts).  \n\u25cf Include a section on potential impacts on ethnic groups in \nthe GMS manual under the subproject. \n\u25cf Vang Vieng  \u25cf Minor/none:  \u25cf None  \u25cf Include ethnic groups in community planning for income \ntown  Few ethnic  generation and asset management in tourism. \nenvironmental  minorities live in  \u25cf  Include  a  separate  budget  for  (i)  a  public  awareness \nimprovement  the town   program and (ii) M&E disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and \n(Lao PDR)  income where possible. \n  \u25cf Consult with ethnic minority communities during subproject \npreparation and before the start of construction. \n\u25cf Use different communication strategies (e.g., text, pictures, \nor  media)  for  raising  awareness  on  waste  management, \nHIV/AIDS, and other tourism-related awareness activities. \n\u25cf  Include  temporary  workers  (e.g.,  solid  waste  collectors) \nwhen strengthen capacity in the urban development authority. \n\u25cf Include a section on potential impacts on ethnic groups in \nthe GMS manual under the subproject. \n ", "44   Appendix 7 \n  Anticipated  Anticipated   \nProject  Positive Effect  Negative  Proposed Actions to Mitigate Impacts \nOutput  Effect \n\u25cf Phong Nha  \u25cf Minor: Few  \u25cf None   \u25cf Include ethnic groups in community planning for income \nKe Bang  ethnic minorities    generation  and  asset  management  through  tourism.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Sustainable Tourism Development Project (the Project)1 will develop a sustainable, \nculturally  and  environmentally  sound,  pro-poor  tourism  approach  for  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) and the implementation of the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy (GMS-TSS). \nThe  Project  outcome  will  be  sustainable  tourism  development  that  creates  livelihood \nopportunities for the poor. The Project seeks to (i) enhance the protection and conservation of \nnatural, cultural, and urban heritage assets of importance for tourism development; (ii) increase \nthe contributions to poverty reduction of pro-poor tourism initiatives; (iii) develop sustainable \ntourism corridors; (iv) raise public officials\u2019 tourism-management skills in provinces and districts \nand at the site; and (v) improve service and hygiene standards among staff in small and \nmedium-sized hospitality enterprises in the provinces. \n \n2.  The Project will have five outputs: (i) model sustainable tourism development projects \nprotecting natural, cultural, and urban heritage sites of importance to tourism are operational; (ii) \npro-poor, community-based, supply-chain tourism projects are developed and operational; (iii) \ncommunity-operated  facilities  along  the  GMS economic  corridors  bring  improved  economic \nbenefits to local communities; (iv) the human resource capacity of public and private tourism \nstakeholders is developed; and (v) efficient project management services are fully operational. \nEnvironmental  assessment  was  conducted  for  small-scale  infrastructure  under  outputs  1 \nthrough  3,  while  environmental  consideration  was  included  in  output  4. 2  Three  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) were prepared: (i) one each for two subprojects identified \nunder component 1 and (ii) one for likely interventions to be identified under components 2 and \n3. The environmental assessment and review framework was also developed. The summary of \noutputs is attached.  \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The project area has a typical tropical monsoon climate with pronounced wet and dry \nseasons and high rainfall, humidity, and temperatures. These climatic conditions vary with \nlatitude  and  altitude  within  the  country,  with  the  mountains  and  highland  areas  receiving \nconsiderably more precipitation and less extreme heat than the floodplains.  \n \n4.  The Mekong River flows through the Siphandone Wetland in southern Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR). The Mekong is a major source of water for agriculture, human \ndomestic use, hydroelectricity, and freshwater fisheries. The wetland is a crucial feeding and \nrearing habitat for an area with exceptionally diverse fish and other aquatic fauna.  About 1,200 \nspecies of fish have been identified in the Mekong River, including such well known endangered \nspecies such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Mekong catfish, and giant barb. \n \n5.  There are several national protected areas in the Project area. Poverty rates in the \nproject provinces are higher than the national average of 38.6%, except in Bokeo (37.4%) and \n                                                 \n1  The Project covers the following nine provinces: Champasak, Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Savanakhet, Oudomxay, \nXayaboury, Saravanh, Houaphanh, and Vientiane. \n2  Small-scale infrastructure includes the following four categories of civil works: (i) construction or rehabilitation of \nexisting  footpaths,  boat  landing  areas,  and  drainage;  (ii)  improvements  to  existing  waste  collection  and \nmanagement practices; (iii) construction or rehabilitation of existing markets; and (iv) protective and improvement \nmeasures in caves.  \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \nVang Vieng town (32%). The upland ethnic minority communities in the project area suffer high \nrates of infant and maternal mortality; low access to health, education, and other social services; \nhigh illiteracy; and limited involvement in the market economy. Since the Lao PDR\u2019s tourism \nproduct  is  strongly  associated  with  nature  and  culture,  tourism  can  offer  new  sets  of \nopportunities to poor people.    \n \nC.  Potential Impacts and Environmental Management Plan \n \n6.  The small scale of the interventions means that potential negative impacts associated \nwith their design, construction, and operation will be temporary, minor, and localized. They can \nbe mitigated to acceptable levels.  \n \n7.  Visitor Impacts on Cave System. A baseline survey will be conducted if construction of \na walkway and lighting system in the Tham Eng cave site on the north\u2013south economic corridor \nis selected under output 3. It is expected to indicate that the impacts can be effectively mitigated \nthrough the adoption of careful planning, design, construction, and operation.  \n \n8.  Unexploded Ordnance. A baseline survey will be conducted to undertake a level 3 \nsurvey of unexploded ordnance to ensure the risks of exposure to the community and visitors is \nminimal with the development of small-scale tourism infrastructure. This is a precautionary \nmeasure,  as  one  of  the  provinces  selected  for  the  pro-poor  program  is  an  affected  area. \nConfirmation of clearance is required where there is site disturbance, especially works and \nconstruction below ground. \n \n9.  Construction Impacts. The subprojects involve small construction works (e.g., scenic \nlookouts, markets, toilets, and walking trails). Possible environmental impacts from construction \nmay include loss of vegetation and increased dust, noise, traffic, waste, and soil erosion. These \nimpacts will be temporary and addressed by a number of specific environmental screening \ncriteria incorporated in the IEEs and the environmental assessment and review framework \n(EARF). \n \n10.  Waste Collection and Treatment. Higher numbers of visitors will generate increased \nsolid wastes and wastewater. The proposed design includes the provision of waste collection \nbins and equipment, the installation of gross pollutant traps in existing drains, and improved \nmanagement  and  hygiene  practices  at  the  solid  waste  site.  The  existing  landfill  site  has \nsufficient capacity to treat more waste. Monitoring of waste collection will be undertaken to \nmeasure the volume and types of waste and appropriately design and modify current waste \ncollection and treatment practices and awareness programs.  \n \n11.  Environmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  improve  the  environmental  and  health \nsituation in and around the subproject sites\u2014and potentially in a larger area, if the models and \napproaches to the development of the subprojects are replicated as envisaged. Waterborne \ndiseases are a significant health threat in the vicinity of all the subproject sites, especially the \nsustainable tourism and pro-poor sites. The Project will reduce solid wastes and water pollution \nin the Vang Vieng River in the Lao PDR, as well as improve the town\u2019s amenities as a tourist \ndestination. It will demonstrate the use of low-impact visitor access infrastructure in sensitive \nenvironments such as at the Siphandone Wetland and at key attractions along the north\u2013south \neconomic corridor in the Lao PDR.  \n \n   ", "Appendix 13  63 \nD.  Public Consultation \n \n12.  A series of public consultations was conducted at the national, provincial, commune, and \nvillage levels during project preparation. Agency representatives and villagers supported the \nproposed  project  activities  and  provided  variable  inputs  on  the  location  and  design  of \ninterventions.  No  major  issues  were  identified  with  the  proposed  projects.  The  public \nconsultations  allowed  ideas  to  be  integrated  into  the  design  of  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  programs.    Public  consultation  is  an  ongoing  and  integral  process  in  project \nimplementation. Continuous dialogue with the communities affected by and/or benefitting from \nthe project, as well as with relevant governments, will be carried out during detailed design and \nimplementation.  \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework \n \n13.  The Lao National Tourism Administration (LNTA) is the Executing Agency, and the \nproject coordination unit (PCU) will be established in it. The Executing Agency is responsible for \ncoordinating relevant local agencies to ensure the adequate quality of IEEs, obtain IEE approval \nfrom the Water Resources and Environmental Administration, and monitor the progress of \nimplementation.  Provincial  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  in  the \ndepartment of tourism of participating provinces. The PIUs bear the main responsibility for \nupdating and implementing environmental management plans for the Siphandone and Vang \nVieng subprojects, conducting environmental assessment for the subprojects to be identified \nunder outputs 2 and 3, in accordance with the EARF prepared during project preparation.  \n \n14.  The  IEEs  prepared  for  the  Project  will  guide  the  PIUs  in  updating  environmental \nmanagement plans for the Siphandone Wetland and Vang Vieng subprojects during detail \ndesign.  The  EARF  will  guide  each  PIU  in  screening  subprojects,  specifying  institutional \nrequirements for environmental management and monitoring to ensure compliance with the \napplicable laws and regulations of the Government and the Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian Development Bank. The EARF is in \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \n15.  The project includes the estimated environmental management plan costs of $20,000 \neach for the Siphandone and Vang Vieng subprojects under output 1 and $10,000 each for \noutputs 2 and 3 for the baseline survey for unexploded ordnance and the Tham Nam Eng cave, \nwater monitoring, and any other necessary monitoring. Environmental personnel (3 person-\nmonths of international consultancy and 10 person-months of national) will be provided in the \nPCU and PIUs. \n \nF.  Conclusion  \n \n16.  The  IEE  found  that  most  of  the  proposed  interventions  will  not  adversely  affect \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  nor  will  they  cause  significant  changes  in  the  physical, \nbiological,  and  social  environment.  A  special  study  will  be  conducted  if  the  proposed \ninterventions at the Tham Nam Eng cave site are selected to ensure that karst environments will \nnot be disturbed. Any environmental effects will be minor and easily mitigated through the \nadoption of sound environmental planning, design, construction, and management practices at \nall sites. No environmental impact assessment is required for the Project.  \n \n ", " \nTable A13: Summary of Outputs \nOutput 1: Sustainable Tourism Development      Output 4: Human  Output 5: \n6\n    Output 2: Pro-poor  Output 3: Facilitation on  Resource  Project  4\n \nNatural Site  Urban Site  Tourism Development  Economic Corridors  Development  Management \n           \nSiphandone Wetland in  Vang Vieng town wastewater  Pro-poor tourism  On the north\u2013south  Support for  Support for  A\np\nChampasak Province  in Vientiane Province  subproject in   corridor, five points plus  training of trainers  efficient project  pe\n    Saravanh Province,  two border points: (i) Nam  in small-scale  management  nd\n  Oudomxay Province,  Ha Protected Area  hospitality service  services  ix\n 1\nHoaphanh Province,  Interpretation Center, (ii)  skills and training  3\n \nBokeo Province, and  Nam Eng Cave Complex,  of public officials \nVang Vieng District in  (iii) Vat Mahaphot and  at two existing \nVientiane Province  ancient site, (iv) Nam  training and \nPhae village scenic  education \nviewpoint, and (v) Don  institutions \nChai/Phimonsin village \nhandicraft market \n \n(i)  Preparation of a  (i)  Extension of drains in the  (i)  Community-based  (i)  Preparation of tourism  Tourism training  (i) Set up project \nheritage-based tourism  core of the town   tourism product  development and  for industries,  coordination \nzoning, structure, and  (ii)  Road pavement and  development  management plans for the  communities and  units  \nmanagement plan   improvements to secondary  (ii)  Identification of  sites  the government    \n(ii)  Improvements to the 4  roads in the town core  tourism development  (ii) Construction of small- (i) review of \nkm access road  (iii)  Installation of gross  supply chain  scale infrastructure   existing training \n(iii)  Environmental  pollutant traps and a wetland  (iii)  Capacity building for  (iii) Community  needs \nimprovements at Ban  filter to remove solid waste  micro enterprises  preparation and livelihood  (ii) development of \nNakasang and on Don Det  (iv)  Provision of an additional  (iv)  Small-scale  support program   services \nand Done Kone   vehicle for solid waste  infrastructure such as  (iv) Tourism management  standards for \n(iv)  Construction of visitor  collection  information centers,  training for site managers  small and \ninformation and interpretation  (v)  Environmental  walking trains, and  and local tour guide  medium-sized \nfacilities and fully interpreted  awareness campaign for  sanitary facilities  training program  enterprises in \naccess trails at Nakasang  residents and business  (v)  Gender  (v) Marketing and  tourism and \nand on Don Det, Done Kone,  establishments   development participation  promotion program for the  hospitality \nand smaller islands  (vi)  Training of the Urban  program  north\u2013south economic  enterprises and \n(v)  Capacity building and  Development Administrative  (vi)  Marketing and  corridor tourism circuit   training standards \nsupport program for local  Authority staff    promotion program  (vi) Impact monitoring and  (iii) development \ncommunities  (vii)  Community-based  evaluation program   of training \n(vi)  Development and  tourism networks    manuals and \nimplementation of a  (viii) Impact monitoring  materials \ncommunity-based natural    (iv) development \nresource monitoring protocol  of web-based \nknowledge center \n       Source: Asian Development Bank. \n   ", "  Appendix 14  65\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN AND FRAMEWORK \n1.  A resettlement plan has been prepared for the two subprojects in component 1 of the \nSustainable Tourism Development Project (the Project), where sites have been identified and \nsurveys  and  consultations  found  that  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  will  be  necessary. \nResettlement frameworks for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam \nhave been prepared because the prioritization and selection of sites for subprojects in outputs 2 \nand 3 will follow a sector approach and be done during project implementation. The frameworks \nhave been developed based on the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and include the specific policies and guidelines for the processes of \nland acquisition and resettlement for each of the two countries.  \n \n2.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts. Resettlement plans have been \nprepared for the subprojects in Siphandone in Lao PDR and Phong Nga Khe Bang National Park \nin Viet Nam. In Siphandone, 28 households with 141 people will be affected. Three households \nwill be relocated, and 28 households (including the three to be relocated) will experience \ntemporary impacts from the relocation of their market stalls. The shop owners have been \nguaranteed a stall at the new market to be constructed under the Project. Seven of the affected \nhouseholds are poor, and two are headed by women. In Phong Nga Khe Bang, one household \nof six people will lose 900 square meters of land currently used for farming. The household is \nneither poor nor ethnic minority. No resettlement plan is required for the Vang Vieng subproject \nin the Lao PDR or the Bac Kan subproject in Viet Nam, as they will not require any land \nacquisition  or  resettlement.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  will \nbecome  necessary,  any  impacts  will  be  addressed  in  accordance  with  the  respective \nresettlement frameworks.  \n \n3.  For each remaining subproject found to require land acquisition and resettlement, a \nresettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  by  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  under  the \nguidance of the project coordination units (PCUs). It is envisaged that, as the interventions will \nbe small and priority will be given to avoiding or minimizing resettlement and land acquisition, \nimpacts will not be significant. Some minimal resettlement or land acquisition may be necessary, \nsuch as relocating a few households; effects on farmland or garden plots and crops; and the \nutilization of public or communal land for the construction of small markets, parking lots, covered \nbus stops, river landings and stairs, embankment protection, cultural and interpretation centers, \nrefreshment stands, walkways, footbridges, toilets with water supply, ticket booths, lodges, \npavilions, and signage. As all impacts are expected to be minimal, it is likely that only short \nresettlement plans will be prepared for this Project. \n \n4.  Legal  and  Policy  Framework.  The  policy  framework  and  entitlements  have  been \ndeveloped from the relevant laws, decrees, and regulations of the governments of Viet Nam and \nthe  Lao  PDR  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  Both  countries  have \nenacted a number of laws, decrees, and regulations that constitute the legal framework for land \nacquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement.  Provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the \nresettlement plans and frameworks will supplement the provisions of relevant decrees currently \nin force in Viet Nam and the Lao PDR, wherever a gap exists.  \n \n5.  Principles  of  Resettlement. The following principles were formulated to bridge the \ndifferences between ADB and government resettlement policies and will apply to all civil works \nundertaken: \n(i)  Involuntary resettlement and impacts on land, structures, and other fixed assets \nwill be avoided or minimized where possible by exploring all alternative options. \n(ii)  Affected people residing, working, doing business, or cultivating on required land \nas of the completion date of the census and detailed measurement survey will be \nentitled to compensation and rehabilitation assistance to assist them in improving, \nor  at  least  maintaining,  their  pre-project  living  standards  and  productive \n ", "66  Appendix 14 \ncapacities. The Project will ensure that affected people are able to find alternative \nsites and income sources. \n(iii)  Lack of formal legal title or rights will not be bar eligibility for compensation and \nassistance under the Project. Affected people will not be displaced until the village \nallocates suitable alternative land or compensation is paid that is sufficient to \npurchase suitable land in the same or a neighboring village. \n(iv)  All compensation will be based on replacement cost at the time of compensation. For \nhouses and other structures, this will involve the costs for materials and labor at the \ntime  of  acquisition,  with  no  deduction  for  depreciation  or  salvageable  materials. \nCompensation for land will be replacement land as a priority or, where this is not \npossible, in cash adequate to purchase land locally of equivalent area and quality and, \nwhere required, to improve land to achieve suitable quality. \n(v)  The process and timing of land and other asset acquisition will be determined in \nconsultation with affected people to minimize disturbance. \n(vi)  Where houses and structures are partly affected to the degree that the remaining \nportion is not viable for its intended use, the Project will acquire the entire asset, \nand affected people will be entitled to compensation at replacement cost for the \nentire asset. \n(vii)  Affected people will be systematically informed and consulted about the Project, \ntheir rights, the options available to them, and proposed mitigating measures. \nThe  comments  and  suggestions  of  affected  people  and communities  will  be \ntaken into account. \n(viii)  The key information in the resettlement plan, such as the measurement of losses, \ndetailed  asset  valuation,  compensation  and  resettlement  options,  detailed \nentitlements and special provisions, grievance procedures, timing of payments, \nand  displacement  schedule  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  people  in  an \nunderstandable format, such as through the distribution of public information \nbooklets, prior to submission to ADB for review and approval. \n(ix)  Resettlement  identification,  planning,  and  management  will  ensure  that  gender \nconcerns  are  incorporated,  including  gender-specific  consultation  and  information \ndisclosure. This includes special attention to guarantee women\u2019s assets, property, and \nland-use rights, and to ensure the restoration of their income and living standards. \n(x)  Existing cultural and religious practices will be respected and, to the maximum \nextent practical, preserved. \n(xi)  Special measures will be incorporated in the resettlement plan to protect socially \nand economically vulnerable groups such as indigenous peoples, households \nheaded by women, children, households headed by the disabled, the elderly, the \nlandless, and people living below the generally accepted poverty line. Vulnerable \naffected  people  will  be  provided  with  appropriate  assistance  to  help  them \nimprove their standard of living through asset-building strategies such as land \nprovision,  replacement  housing  of  minimum  standards,  and  strengthened \nsecurity of tenure. \n(xii)  There will be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nthe  updating  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Resettlement \ncommittees will include representatives from affected people, especially women \nand other vulnerable groups. \n(xiii)  Institutional arrangements will be in place for the timely and effective design, \nplanning,  consultation,  and  implement  of  the  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation programs. \n(xiv)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available to cover the \ncosts of land acquisition and resettlement within the agreed implementation period. \n(xv)  Appropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system. Monitoring and \n   ", "  Appendix 14  67\nevaluation of the land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation processes and \ntheir final outcomes will be conducted by an independent monitor. \n(xvi)  Voluntary donation will not be applied for any assets. \n(xvii)  Civil works contracts will not be awarded for a specific subproject or geographic area \nuntil (a) compensation payment and relocation to new sites have been satisfactorily \ncompleted  for  that  subproject  or  geographic  area;  (b)  the  agreed  rehabilitation \nprogram is in place; and (iii) the area is free from all encumbrances as per the \napproved resettlement plan. \n(xviii)  Cash compensation or replacement land for affected households losing all of \ntheir residential land will be made available well ahead of civil works to allow the \naffected households sufficient time to reconstruct their houses. \n(xix)  No demolition of assets and/or entry to properties will be done until the affected \nhousehold is fully compensated and relocated. \n \n6.  Entitlements  and  Compensation. Entitlements and compensation are based on the \nProject\u2019s social surveys and consultations and on the Governments\u2019 and ADB\u2019s requirements and \nprocedures. People eligible for compensation are those who will experience negative impacts on \ntheir  assets  or  livelihoods  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  Affected  people  who  appear  in  the \nsubprojects\u2019  census  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  and  assistance.  Loss  of  land  will  be \ncompensated  through  land-for-land  arrangements  or,  if  the  affected  people  prefer,  cash \ncompensation at an amount equal to the current market value. For affected houses and structures, \ncompensation and assistance will be equivalent to the provision of, or full replacement costs for, \nbuilding a house or structure of the same size and standard. Loss of unharvested annual crops \nwill be compensated at current market value. Relocating households will receive subsistence \nallowances, and affected people belonging to vulnerable groups will be entitled to additional \nspecial  allowances.  The  resettlement  frameworks  contain  detailed  entitlement  matrixes \nsummarizing types of impact, eligibility, and compensation. However, it may not cover all types \nof impact and can be enhanced in the resettlement plans depending on the findings of the \nsurveys  and  subproject  impacts.  Standards  described  may  not  be  lowered  but  may  be \nenhanced in the ensuing resettlement plans as required and on the basis of detailed social \nimpact  analysis.  The  entitlement  matrix  is  found  in  the  resettlement  frameworks  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \n7.  Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress. At the early stages of project \npreparation, local authorities and leaders of different administrative levels in each of the Project \nareas were informed about the project proposal and its objectives and proposed activities. They \nwere consulted on development needs and resettlement issues, their perception of project \nobjectives  and  technical  designs,  and  their  tasks  and  roles  in  project  planning  and \nimplementation. Affected people were informed of the proposed Project by household and have \nbeen involved in developing the proposed resettlement and compensation packages. Some \nhave expressed their preference for the type of compensation to receive. Disclosure of the \nresettlement plans to the affected people has been done, using locally appropriate information \nbooklets.  Further  consultations  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  finalizing  detailed  design  to \nincorporate affected people\u2019s requests and suggestions to minimize resettlement impacts. A \ngrievance mechanism has been established to ensure that affected people\u2019s concerns and \ngrievances are addressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. Affected people \nwill be made fully aware of their grievance rights and the procedures, verbally and in writing, \nduring consultation and the survey and at the time of compensation.  \n \n8.  Implementation Arrangements. Responsibility for resettlement spans various levels of \ngovernment and project contractors. In Viet Nam, these include the Ministry of Culture, Sports, \nand Tourism; provincial people\u2019s committees; district people\u2019s committees, project implementation \nconsultants; and specifically formed provincial, district, and village resettlement committees. The \nresettlement framework and plans will be approved by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism \n ", "68  Appendix 14 \n(MCST) and the provincial people\u2019s committees of the relevant provinces. In the Lao PDR, the \ninstitutions  responsible  include  the  Lao  National  Tourism  Administration  (LNTA);  Urban \nDevelopment Administration Authority\u2019s Department of Public Works and Transport (in Vang \nVieng); Water Resource and Environment Administration; project implementation consultants; \nprovincial  authorities;  and  specifically  formed  provincial,  district,  and  village  resettlement \ncommittees. The resettlement framework and plans will be approved by LNTA and the Water \nResources and Environmental Administration and endorsed by the relevant provinces. The PIUs \nwill ensure coordination of provincial and/or district agencies involved in resettlement and review \ncompensation rates and the resettlement budget. \n \n9.  Implementation  Schedule.  The  resettlement  plans  include  detailed  implementation \nschedules coordinated with the civil works schedule. All subproject resettlement plans will be \nreviewed by ADB prior to project implementation. Approval to award any civil works contracts \nwill not be given until the required lands have been fully acquired and the affected households \nare appropriately compensated and relocated. \n \n10.  Monitoring and Evaluation. The PCU and PIUs are responsible for internal monitoring \nof land acquisition and resettlement. The PIUs will submit quarterly resettlement reports to the \nPCUs. The PCUs will include PIU resettlement progress in the Project\u2019s quarterly progress \nreports submitted to ADB. Monitoring reports will be uploaded to ADB's website. For external \nmonitoring and post evaluation activities, the PCUs will engage a suitable domestic agency \nacceptable to ADB, under terms of reference acceptable to ADB. The PCUs and PIUs will \nprovide the domestic agency with all resettlement-related documents.  \n \n11.  Cost  and  Budget.  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  made \navailable  to  cover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  within  the  agreed \nimplementation period. Subproject resettlement plans will include a breakdown of each type of \nloss with corresponding cost estimates reflecting replacement costs at current market values. \nThe cost estimates will make adequate provision for contingencies.  \n \n12.
