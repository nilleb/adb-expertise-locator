THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $75,000,000 (or its equivalent in baht) to B.Grimm Power Public Company \n(B.Grimm) for the ASEAN Distributed Power Project. The report also describes the proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $20,000,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for \nthe Private Sector in Asia (CCFPS) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \n(CEFPF). If the Board approves the proposed equity investment described above, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loan from CCFPS. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. Demand for electricity in Thailand increased by an average of 3.6% \nper year during 2005\u20132016. Total electricity consumption was 182,846 gigawatt-hours in 2016, \nup 4.6% from the 2015 level of 174,834 gigawatt-hours. As of January 2017, Thailand\u2019s installed \npower generation capacity was 41,242 megawatts (MW). Production of electricity depends heavily \non fossil fuels\u201463% is generated from natural gas, 11% from lignite, and 7% from coal. Although \nrenewable energy sources currently contribute only 8%, the Government of Thailand\u2019s promotion \nof alternative energy under the Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u20132036 is expected to \nincrease renewable energy capacity to 19,684 MW (30% of total capacity) by 2036, with 6,000 \nMW coming from solar power and 3,000 MW from wind power. 1 The plan was prepared as part \nof the government\u2019s strategy to diversify the energy mix and promote renewable energy, and (i) \nnotes the significant potential of renewable energy in Thailand, and (ii) indicates that energy \nimports can be avoided through development of domestic renewable energy projects with private \ninvestment.  \n \n3.  Countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region face a rapid \nincrease in energy demand, driven by socioeconomic factors that include rapid population growth, \nsustained economic growth, growing urbanization, an expanding middle class population, and \nincreased access to electricity. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment, electricity consumption by countries in the ASEAN region will grow 8.04% per year \nduring  2009\u20132030. This  poses major  challenges to  achieving  and  balancing  energy  policy \nobjectives in the region, including energy security, sustainable development, energy access, and \naffordability. \n \n4.  ADB identified the opportunity to provide financial assistance to B.Grimm through close \ncooperation and strong relationships that ADB has built over the last 5 years with key players in \nthe Thai energy sector, with the goal of (i) implementing ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \nand the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Thailand, which emphasize support for \nclean energy and environmentally sustainable growth;2 and (ii) supporting the recently adopted \nSustainable Development Goals, which seek to substantially increase the share of renewable \nenergy in the global energy mix.3  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n                                                \n1  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy. 2015.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED   \n \n6.  Borrower and/or investee. B.Grimm, established in 1993 in Thailand, is an energy \ncompany that focuses on the development, financing, construction and operation of greenfield \npower plants. B.Grimm is a part of B.Grimm Group, Thailand\u2019s oldest infrastructure and industrial \ngroup in operation, which was founded in 1878.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Output \n7.  Impacts. The impacts will be (i) regional progress ensured in increasing substantially the \nshare of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030;4 and (ii) the energy mix diversified \nthrough  the  addition  of  alternative  energy  capacity  and  more  electricity  consumption  from \nrenewable sources.5  \n \n8.  Outcome. The outcome will be the sustained operation of private sector renewable power \nprojects in the ASEAN region. \n \n9.   Output. The output will be the rollout and operation of renewable power projects in the \nASEAN region. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n10.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nthe  ADB  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  (footnote  2)  for  (i) environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment; (ii) the role of the private sector in meeting growing energy demand in the region; \nand (iii) capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure development, finance, and \nother  areas.  The  midterm  review  also  supported  the  expansion  of  environment-friendly \ntechnologies for clean and efficient energy generation and use, as well as a larger role for private \nsector  financing  of  infrastructure.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategies  for  various  ADB \ndeveloping member countries echo the themes of the energy policy, including the promotion of \nenvironmentally sustainable economic development and energy security.  \n \n11.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments \nin energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.6 The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of \n$6 billion in annual financing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and catalyze further \nprivate sector resources in the clean energy sector.  \n \nD.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n13.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  B.Grimm  in  the  diversification  and  expansion  of  its \nrenewable energy portfolio in the ASEAN region. By working with a well-established energy \ncompany with a strong track record of successful execution, ADB will be able to extend its reach \nto multiple energy and renewable power projects, which would be difficult to assist directly. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation in the IPO will play an important role not only in providing direct financing but also in \nattracting third-party investors and establishing more confidence in B.Grimm\u2019s future access to \ncapital markets. ADB\u2019s presence as an equity investor will also ensure that B.Grimm will adopt \nand implement ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguards standards. \n \n ", "4   \n14.  The CCFPS loan will contribute to the diversification of the ASEAN region\u2019s energy mix \nby adding renewable energy capacity, in particular distributed solar energy, thereby helping the \nregion achieve sustainable long-term economic growth and transition to a low-carbon economy.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n15.  The CCFPS loan will also help the company establish renewable energy solutions in some \nof the ASEAN region\u2019s more challenging legal and regulatory contexts. Countries such as \nCambodia, Myanmar, the Lao PDR, Indonesia and Viet Nam are only recently beginning to \ndevelop distributed renewable power options such as solar and wind, and new developers face a \nrange of technical, legal, regulatory and financing challenges. Through the use of concessional \nfinance, ADB will help to demonstrate a track record of successful financing to encourage private \nsector developers to take on the higher risk associated with these projects. \n \nC.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n17.  B.Grimm will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.8 B.Grimm will report on an annual basis to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws \nand (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements.9 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n18.  B.Grimm was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
