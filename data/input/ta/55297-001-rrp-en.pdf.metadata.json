I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $12,000,000 (in sum equivalent) to Anglesey Food Foreign Enterprise LLC (Korzinka) for \nthe Korzinka COVID-19 Food Retail Supply Chain Support Project in Uzbekistan. \n \n2.  The proceeds of debt financing will provide essential liquidity to Korzinka, a company \nengaged  in  food  retailing,  to  enhance  resilience  to  the  disruptive  economic  effects  of  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, sustain food security, support Korzinka\u2019s growth, and \npreserve the livelihoods of more than 4,400 employees and more than 1,200 farm workers.1 The \nproject will help Korzinka build inventory buffers (for existing and new supermarkets) of essential \nfood products including wheat, buckwheat, and potatoes to mitigate the risk of COVID-19-related \nsupply disruptions; support faster payments to risk-averse suppliers; and fund COVID-19-related \noperating expenditures including masks, sanitization, personal protective equipment, testing, and \nstaff quarantining costs. Furthermore, ADB will help raise Korzinka\u2019s equal opportunity standards \nin the food retail industry and improve the inclusion of women in the workforce.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  COVID-19 impact on the economy of Uzbekistan. Although Uzbekistan\u2019s economy \nexpanded in 2020, the pandemic slowed growth to 1.7% after an average of 5.5% during 2016\u2013\n2019 (forecast of 4.0% in 2021).2 In early 2020, the Government of Uzbekistan imposed a strict \nlockdown.3 While these restrictions have been mostly relaxed, the emergence of new COVID-19 \nvariants has led to an increase in cases, which peaked in July\u2013August 2021 with 800\u20131,000 cases \nper day and decreased to around 400 cases in October 2021.4 The effects of the pandemic, \nrestrictions, and economic fallout is disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable communities, \nincluding in rural areas.5 Unemployment rose from 9.0% to 11.1% during 2019\u20132020 and the \nnumber of people living in poverty rose to around 3 million (9.0% of 34 million), an additional \n500,000 people compared with the precrisis forecast (7.4%). During the initial lockdown in 2020, \ntraditional bazaars were closed while modern retail continued.6 Thus, modern retail served as an \nimportant sales channel for farmers who faced increasing sales risks and uncertain incomes. \nHence, Korzinka is centrally positioned to support weaker supply chain partners including farmers \nthrough liquidity support to sustain operations and provide relative certainty of future sales.  \n \n4.  Food security in Uzbekistan. During the pandemic, Uzbekistan\u2019s food imports increased \nfrom 9.3% as a share of imports in 2019 to 11.2% in 2020.7 Adding to this, Uzbekistan\u2019s trading \npartners restricted food trade. The Russian Federation banned exports of wheat (in May\u2013June \n \n1  Based on company data as of 31 December 2020; 1,274 farm workers = 30 commercial farms with an average 25 \nfarm workers plus 16 medium-sized farms (average 10 workers) plus 91 smallholder farms (average 4 workers). \n2  ADB. 2021.

", "2 \n2020) and buckwheat (in June\u2013August 2021) while Kazakhstan imposed a wheat export quota \n(for 2020) and Ukraine limited sunflower oil exports (2020 to mid-2021).8 Korzinka responded by \nsourcing from local processors, who increased production of key staples such as flour and \nvegetable oils.9 In addition, the company drew on the government\u2019s strategic food reserves of \nbuckwheat and potatoes.10 Although some restrictions have been phased out, the risk of further \nsupply shocks remains. The business environment continues to be marred by uncertainties \nacross the supply chain, including raw material shortages, high freight costs, risks of border \nclosures, and risk aversion of suppliers demanding faster repayments. These factors all lead to \nincreased costs of doing business and higher working capital needs. \n \n5.  Importance of the agriculture sector in Uzbekistan. Agriculture is the largest sector \nand largest employer in Uzbekistan\u2019s economy. In 2019, agriculture contributed to 28% of gross \ndomestic product while employing 27% of the labor force (3.7 million people). The sector is divided \ninto large commercial farms with an average size of around 100.0 hectares employing 40% of \nsector workers, and smallholder farms of around 0.3 hectares employing around 60% of sector \nworkers. Agricultural output has been dominated by wheat and cotton; however, the Government \nof Uzbekistan is supporting farm diversification into higher value and labor-intensive horticulture. \nIn 2020, the closing of bazaars posed a serious threat to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in \nrural areas, who account for around 80% of Uzbekistan\u2019s poor.11 As bazaars were closed, farmers \nfaced liquidity problems as they were unable to sell their produce. Korzinka increased sourcing \ndirectly from farmers and accelerated payments to farmers to support their operations and sustain \nthe supply of essential produce, thereby preserving livelihoods. \n \n6.  Project selection. Korzinka is a suitable candidate for ADB\u2019s indirect COVID-19 response \nas the company (i) is affected by COVID-19-related uncertainty whereby suppliers demand faster \nrepayments to sustain and increase supplies; (ii) aims to build an interim inventory buffer of food \nproducts  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  COVID-19-related  supply  shocks  (for  new  and  existing \nsupermarket stores); (iii) needs to fund incremental operational expenditures including masks, \nsanitization supplies, and personal protective equipment for staff; (iv) requires ADB\u2019s medium-\nterm financing that is unavailable from local banks; (v) will help support food security in Uzbekistan \nas a key supplier of staples, serving more than 710,000 households (11% of the population) while \nalso supporting the livelihoods of more than 4,400 employees and more than 1,200 farm workers; \nand (vi) is willing to partner with ADB to enhance its gender equality standards. \n \n2.  Project Design  \n  \n7.  One ADB approach. The project has been developed in close collaboration between the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department and the Central and West Asia Regional Department. The \nUzbekistan Resident Mission has been instrumental in identifying and cultivating the relationship \nwith the company since 2019 and facilitated due diligence. In addition, the project is expected to \nhave synergies with two ongoing sovereign projects on horticulture value chain development.12 \n \n8  Kazakhstan accounts for more than 95% of Uzbekistan\u2019s wheat imports.

This information is being disclosed to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. ", "3 \nLiquidity for working capital and supporting rural livelihoods. Korzinka has increased direct \nsourcing of horticulture produce from local farms. As traditional bazaars closed, Korzinka served \nas an alternate sales channel to help sustain farmers\u2019 operations through the COVID-19 crisis. \nWhile the company sourced from 137 farms in 2020, this number is expected to reach 176 in \n2021, of which two-thirds are smallholder farms (operating less than 2 hectares). [Redacted] \nKorzinka\u2019s suppliers are operating at their exposure limits. In addition, given the uncertainties due \nto the COVID-19 environment, suppliers have become risk averse such that they demand faster \nrepayments. Thus, Korzinka plans to temporarily reduce the average payable days [Redacted]. \nThis will support suppliers in meeting Korzinka\u2019s growing demand during this uncertain period \n[Redacted].  \n \n8.  Strengthen food security, food safety, and nutrition. The grocery retail market is \nshifting from traditional bazaars towards modern retail. Consumers benefit from product variety, \nsafer and better-quality food products, and an increased level of hygiene, which is especially \nimportant in the COVID-19 context.13 As Uzbekistan\u2019s largest modern grocery retail firm, Korzinka \ncontributes to food security as it serves more than 11% of households. Korzinka is certified ISO \n9001 and ISO 22000, ensuring the highest product quality, food safety, and hygiene.14 Korzinka\u2019s \nfood products include essential food items such as fruit and vegetables, groceries, baked and \nprepared  food,  beverages,  meat,  and  dairy  products.  At  the  onset  of  the  pandemic,  the \nGovernment  of  Uzbekistan  removed  import  duties  on  essential  food  staples  (flour,  pasta, \nvegetable oils) and required retailers to temporarily increase stocks of these products.15 To \nmitigate  the  risk  of  further  supply  disruptions,  Korzinka  plans  to  build  an  inventory  buffer \n[Redacted].  \n \n9.  Preserve livelihoods of farmers and workers. About 65% of purchases are sourced \nlocally,  including  fruit  and  vegetables  (e.g.,  tomatoes,  apples,  potatoes,  onions)  and  dairy \nproducts (milk, yoghurt), which directly supports the local economy and rural farmers. Through its \nsourcing, Korzinka impacts the livelihoods of over 1,200 farmers and farm workers. Climate \nchange impact on the project is low as Korzinka has diversified sources of supply. Furthermore, \nKorzinka has more than 4,400 employees, with monthly gross salaries of $216 for the lowest job \ncategory (administrative and junior roles), which is almost three times the minimum wage ($79).16 \nSalaries were paid in full during the pandemic, thereby preserving the livelihoods of employees. \nKorzinka has adopted various COVID-19-related measures such as the provision of gloves, \ntemperature checks, disinfection, and testing, and plans to increase the number of employees to \n6,000 (at an average pay of $240 for the above-mentioned positions) by 2023.  \n \n10.  Strengthen women\u2019s participation. The Uzbekistan labor market displays clear gender \nsegregation by sector as women are highly represented in socially oriented sectors. The main \nforms of gender inequality are reported in discrimination in employment, dismissal, and career \npromotion.17 Female entrepreneurs are mostly involved in low-return service entrepreneurship \nand the vast majority of agri-business suppliers in Uzbekistan are businesses led by men.18 \nAdditionally, businesses led by women are disadvantaged when supplying to large companies, \n \n13 PwC. 2008.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n19.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with \nStrategy 2030, which calls for ADB \u201cto scale up its financing for agribusiness.\u201d23 The project will \nbe ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign agribusiness transaction in Uzbekistan and is aligned with (i) the \ngovernment\u2019s strategy to diversify agricultural output towards high-value horticulture; and (ii) ADB \ncountry partnership strategy 2019\u20132023 for Uzbekistan, which targets financing \u201cdirectly to \nbankable  private  sector  and  [state-owned  enterprise]  clients,  principally  in  the  financial, \nagribusiness, and infrastructure areas.

Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s $20 billion COVID-19 response package, whereby ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \nDepartment  focuses  on  financing  for  working capital  and  operating  expenditure  to  support \ncontinuity of operations of financially strong companies facing temporary liquidity issues because \nof the pandemic.28 The project is aligned with Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, \n2019\u20132024, which identifies \u201cfood brands and food retail\u201d as a priority segment because of the \n\u201cpotential to drive and structure upstream subsectors (e.g., on quality standards, traceability).\u201d29  \n \n \n23 ADB. 2018.

The project builds on lessons learned from previous \nfinancings to relatively small companies with key person risk.30 First, the company is positioned \ndownstream in the food value chain, which is a less risky segment than primary agricultural \nproduction. Second, the EBRD as a shareholder is leading corporate governance reforms, hence \nmitigating key person risk. Third, consistent with a risk appetite approach, the ticket size has been \nkept small given the size of the company and risks associated with the country. This deal selection \nand transaction structuring approach is consistent with the agribusiness strategy for smaller \u201cTier-\n3\u201d companies that are \u201cleaders in their country or in their niche\u201d (footnote 30).   \n \nD.

", "7 \nsustaining livelihoods of workers and low-income farmers.32 It is an inclusive business project as \nit will integrate farmers and farm workers in the base of the income pyramid. Korzinka is also \ncommitted to promoting gender equality. This is a One ADB project between Private Sector \nOperations Department and the Uzbekistan Resident Mission as the resident mission has actively \nsupported deal origination and due diligence. \n \nIII.  THE ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB will provide Korzinka a 3-year semi-annual amortizing (secured) local currency loan \nof $12,000,000 with 1-year grace period. The main terms and conditions of ADB\u2019s proposed loan \nhave been agreed with Korzinka. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB assistance will add value on three fronts: \n \n(i)  Access to medium-term financing. Korzinka has traditionally financed its term loans \nthrough two local commercial banks. Sum-denominated working capital loans are only \navailable in short tenors of 12\u201318 months, which creates funding challenges. ADB\u2019s \nfinancing will help Korzinka lower annual transaction costs and mitigate refinancing \nrisk by providing financing over a longer planning horizon. \n(ii)  Diversified funding base. Lending terms offered by local banks are limited. During a \nsignificant devaluation of the sum in 2017, local banks only issued hard currency loans \n[Redacted]. ADB\u2019s financing will provide appropriate local currency funding and help \nKorzinka diversify its funding sources. \n(iii) Gender inclusion. ADB will promote gender equality by working with Korzinka to \nimplement a gender action plan to promote the inclusion of female suppliers, to \naddress gender gaps in strategic managerial roles and at corporate level.33 \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[Redacted]  \n \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n27.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category C), involuntary resettlement (category C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).34 \n \n28.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \n \n32 The project is classified as an \u201cinclusive business\u201d as the beneficiaries are mainly smallholder farmers and farm \nworkers belonging to the base of the pyramid (bottom half of the income pyramid) in Uzbekistan. \n33 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "8 \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Korzinka  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts need to be strengthened. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s due diligence included a corporate audit through desktop review of documents \nprovided by Korzinka and interviews with management staff. Korzinka is certified as ISO 9001 \nand ISO 22000 and is currently preparing to apply for ISO 14001, ISO 45001, and ISO 50001 \ncertification,  and  recertification.  Thus,  most  policies  and  procedures  in  the  integrated \nmanagement system either need to be developed or are being revised and amended. The \nenvironment, health, and safety management of Korzinka\u2019s operations is under the supervision \nof the director general and the quality control department. The corporate audit observed gaps in \nKorzinka\u2019s  environmental  and  social  policies  and  procedures.  Corrective  actions  were \nrecommended to enhance the environment, health and safety, social, and labor policies and \nprocedures and to strengthen institutional capacity. Detailed findings and corrective actions have \nbeen discussed and agreed. \n \n30.  The loan will not be used to fund any construction or expansion of physical assets which \ninvolve activities that include permanent or temporary land acquisition; any retrofit, rehabilitation, \nor expansion projects; or any activities that may directly or indirectly affect indigenous peoples or \nvulnerable ethnic minorities. Nevertheless, Korzinka\u2019s processes were reviewed, and it was \nestablished that Korzinka acquires assets on a willing buyer, willing seller basis. The project \nactivities are likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. \n \n31.  Korzinka will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, comply with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and abide by national laws and regulations. Korzinka will comply with national \nlabor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply \nwith international core labor standards. It will report regularly to ADB on compliance with such \nlaws, and measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people, if \nneeded, will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.35 \n \n32.  Effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development, Korzinka has incorporated \nmeasures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities.36 Key \nfeatures of the gender action plan include (i) recommendations by Korzinka on gender-responsive \npractices in food staple supply chains to a portion of its large suppliers, (ii) integration of female \nsuppliers in Korzinka\u00b4s value chains, (iii) staffing target of women in store management positions, \n(iv)  participation  of  skills-based  female  staff  in  a  tailored  leadership  training  program,  (v) \nestablishment of a women\u2019s network to steer career development, and (vi) increased awareness \nof staff on sexual harassment and on Korzinka\u2019s policies on this issue. Korzinka will submit \nperiodic reports on implementation of its gender action plan to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n33.  Korzinka was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe loan documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, \nand the financing of terrorism and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n \n35 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n36 ADB. 1998.
