During  the  country  programming  midterm  review  mission  in  March  2006,  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to implement the national flood management strategy.1 The \nconcept paper for the TA project was included in the country strategy and program update \n(2007\u20132008).2 During  the  country  programming  review  mission  in  November  2006,  the \nGovernment confirmed its request. In June 2007, a fact-finding mission visited the PRC and \nreached understanding with the Government on the TA impact, outcome, output, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC has a long history of loss of life and damage to property due to flooding, \ncosting 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) per year on average. The Government has \ntraditionally  relied  on  structural  measures  to  control  floods.  However,  as  floodplains  have \nbecome more densely settled due to population pressure, flood damage has risen, despite \nmajor public investment in structural flood control measures. The Government, recognizing the \nneed for a more integrated approach to flood management, in 1997 passed the Flood Control \nLaw. It demonstrates the Government\u2019s assessment that more integrated flood management is \nnecessary in order to adapt to changing social, hydrological, and environmental conditions \nalong the nation\u2019s major waterways. The Flood Control Law provided a platform for better \nintegration  of  water  disaster  issues,  with  provisions  for  more  coordination  between \nadministrative  departments  and  for  recognition  of  the  role  of  land  management  in  flood \nmanagement. Furthermore, in the wake of the catastrophic floods of 1998\u2014when the Yangtze \nand Songhua-Liao river basins flooded more than 2.5 million hectares, damaged 7 million \nhouses,  killed  3,500  people,  and  resulted  in  monetary  losses  of  about  $30  billion\u2014the \nGovernment announced a new policy emphasizing the importance of an integrated approach to \nnatural resources management, including flood management.  \n \n3.  To  shift  from  dependence  on  structural  measures  for  reducing  flood  damage  to  a \nbalanced approach using both structural and nonstructural measures, the Ministry of Water \nResources (MWR) supported by ADB\u2019s TA 3 prepared a national flood management strategy in \n2005. This TA involved four major activities: (i) assessment of the present flooding situation in \nselected provinces, (ii) identification of options for flood management, (iii) formulation of the \nnational flood management strategy and its action plan to provide a general basis for designing \nand  guiding  integrated  flood  management  programs  at  the  provincial  level,  and  (iv)  wider \ndissemination of study findings and awareness building. Preliminary ways to implement the \nnational  flood  management  strategy  were  identified,  including  strengthening  an  enabling \ninstitutional framework, combined with enhanced interagency and interministry coordination. \n \n4.  A basic conclusion of the previous TA was that the traditional PRC approach of using \nstructural flood control measures, which relies on major civil works, is no longer practically or \neconomically feasible. Integrated management of human occupation and use of floodplains \nshould become the core of a new concept of flood management in the PRC. This concept is \ncalled flood risk management. Flood risk management is based on an analysis of the exposure \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 May 2007. \n2  ADB. 2006.

This is followed by identification, assessment, and \nimplementation of appropriate measures to manage or reduce flood risk to levels regarded as \nacceptable.  The  measures  used  to  manage  or  reduce  flood  risks  can  be  structural  or \nnonstructural. Structural measures involve construction of civil works, having the objective of \nkeeping floodwater away from people or property that would otherwise be at risk. Nonstructural \nmeasures involve limiting exposure to flood risk through planning measures that regulate future \ndevelopment using land zoning, property acquisition, and resettlement. Nonstructural measures \nalso involve reducing the vulnerability of people, property, and livelihood at risk by providing \nflood warnings, emergency response planning, flood proofing of buildings, and other similar \nrelatively low-cost measures.  \n \n5.  In general, structural flood control is significantly more expensive than nonstructural \nflood management. The feasibility of using large-scale structural works in the PRC is further \nlimited because of scarce fiscal resources, especially in provinces where the need for social \nservices is intense, and also because of the complexity and lack of effectiveness of large-scale \nstructural works construction, particularly in areas prone to flash flooding. This supports the \nwidespread adoption of flood risk management for flood control in the PRC\u2019s poor central and \nwestern regions.  \n \n6.  In the southwestern region of the PRC, flash flooding has great impact. Flash flooding is \nespecially severe and destructive to life, property, and means of livelihood in small upstream \ncatchment basins where people often live at the bottom of narrow river valleys. In the central \nregion, riverine flooding is the most common form of flooding. Periodic and long-term riverine \nflooding disrupts housing, infrastructure, and means of livelihood. The risk of flood damage on a \nrecurrent basis inhibits public and private investment in flood detention basins. \n \n7.  In order to follow up the previous TA, which developed the national flood management \nstrategy and action plan for the PRC, MWR has requested ADB for a new TA project to further \ndevelop and implement the national flood management strategy at the provincial level with a \nfocus on the central and western regions of the PRC. During the fact-finding mission, the \nGovernment requested that pilot studies be implemented under the proposed TA in a typical \nmountainous area with serious flash flooding (Sichuan province) and a typical floodplain with \nflood detention basins (Hunan province), and that through pilot studies the TA implement (i) the \nintroduction of nonstructural measures to manage vulnerability to the potential danger and \ndamage  caused  by  exposure  to  flood  risk,  including  flood  risk  mapping,  flood  forecasting \nsystems, flood warning, and an emergency response plan; (ii) the raising of local people\u2019s \nawareness of flood management; and (iii) the improvement of flood management policies. \n \n8.  ADB has been increasingly involved in flood management operations in the PRC, e.g., \nthe Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project4 and the Hunan Flood Management Sector \nProject.5 The proposed TA will support provinces to adopt the national flood management \nstrategy  and  also  contribute  to  integrated  water  resources  management  by  exploring  the \npotential  for  integrating  flood  management  with  water  resources  management.  The  TA  is \ntherefore in line with the priorities of ADB\u2019s water policy in promoting a national focus on water \nsector reform and is fostering integrated management of water resources. The proposed TA is \nalso  in  line  with  the  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2007\u20132008)  and  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s objectives in the water sector. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

The impact of the TA is to promote the sustainable economic and social development of \nflood-prone areas in the PRC through effective and integrated measures of flood management. \nThe outcome of the TA is the implementation of the national flood management strategy at the \nprovincial level. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, to be conducted over a \nperiod of 5 months, the consultants will (i) review flood management in Hunan and Sichuan \nprovinces, including existing provincial flood management strategies; (ii) identify key issues for \nfuture flood management in these two provinces; (iii) provide recommendations for improving \nexisting  provincial  flood  management  strategies  following  the  national  flood  management \nstrategy;  and  (iv)  develop  provincial  flood  management  action  plans  and  implementation \npriorities,  particularly  for  nonstructural  measures,  following  the  national  flood  management \naction plan in order to implement the national flood management strategy in the two provinces. \nConsultants  will  carry  out  these  tasks  through  study,  field  investigation,  and  workshops. \nWorkshops will be held in each province to gather information and data at the beginning and to \nobtain feedback on the developed provincial flood management strategies and action plans at \nthe end of this phase.  \n \n11.  In the second phase, to be conducted over a period of 7 months, the consultants will \nhelp local governments conduct pilot tests in implementing the national flood management \nstrategy, particularly nonstructural measures,  in the two provinces based on the provincial \naction  plans  developed  in  the  first  phase,  and  develop  capacity  of  local  government  staff \nthrough  the  pilot  tests.  The  consultants  will  introduce  to  local  governments  nonstructural \nmeasures to manage vulnerability to the potential danger and damage caused by exposure to \nflood risk, including flood risk mapping, flood forecasting systems, flood warning and emergency \nresponse, and raising of local people\u2019s awareness of flood management. These nonstructural \nmeasures will be implemented by local government staff under the guidance of the consultants \nin  selected  pilot-test  areas  in  the  two  provinces.  Prototype  investment  projects  for  flood \nmanagement will also be proposed and appraised by local government staff under the guidance \nof the consultants and in accordance with the provincial action plans. Based on the activities in \nthe first phase and the results of the pilot tests, the consultants will provide recommendations \nfor implementing the national flood management strategy at the provincial level. A national \nworkshop at central level will be undertaken at the end of the TA to disseminate its findings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 of the TA costs. The TA will be cofinanced on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program for $200,000 equivalent and by the Netherlands Trust Fund for \nthe Water Financing Partnership Facility administered by ADB for $300,000 equivalent. The \nNetherlands  Trust  Fund  will  be  used  for  specific  activities  shown  in  Appendix  2.  The \nGovernment will provide $150,000 equivalent to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services, \nincluding the provision of necessary data, office space, counterpart staff, site transportation, and \nother administrative support. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MWR is responsible for the overall \nadministration  of  water  resources throughout the  PRC  and  has shown  strong capacity  for \nexecuting externally-assisted projects (footnotes 3, 4, and 5). A steering committee will be \nestablished  under  MWR  to  provide  overall  guidance  for  TA  implementation.  The  steering \ncommittee members will be senior representatives from MWR, the Ministry of Finance, the \nNational Development and Reform Commission, and other ministries, as necessary. A TA \nproject management office (TMO) will be established in MWR to act as the secretariat of the \nsteering committee, administer the day-to-day activities of the TA, and coordinate with ADB and \nthe two provinces. MWR will assign an experienced full-time MWR staff member to serve as the \ndirector of the TMO, and counterpart staff to work closely with the TA consultants. MWR will \nalso provide office space, access to communications and copiers, and logistical support for TA \nimplementation. The director of the TMO will manage and liquidate funds provided by ADB and \nthe Government for training, seminars, and conferences. \n \n14.  The  respective  departments  of  water  resources  (DWRs)  of  Hunan  and  Sichuan \nprovinces  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  A  TA  implementation  office  (TIO)  will  be \nestablished in each DWR. Each DWR will assign an experienced full-time DWR staff member to \nserve as TA task manager, and counterpart staff to work closely with the TA consultants. Each \nDWR will also provide office space, access to communications and copiers, and logistical \nsupport for TA implementation.  \n \n15.  A panel of technical experts will be established as required to provide its opinions on the \nwork of the TA consultants, the TMO, and TIOs. The panel members will be experts from \nrelevant sectors. The panel will collaborate with the TMO and TIOs in organizing at least three \n1-day panel meetings during TA implementation (at inception, midterm, and final phases). \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, starting in March 2008 and ending in \nFebruary 2009. Substantial time will be devoted to survey, fieldwork, workshops, and capacity \ndevelopment.  It  is  expected  that  at  least  two  workshops  in  each  province  and  a  national \nworkshop at central level will be undertaken. The consultants will submit an inception report \nwithin the first 4 weeks of the start of the TA, and an interim report 5 months after the TA starts. \nA draft final report will be submitted 10 months after the TA commencement, and a final report \nat the TA conclusion. The inception, interim, and draft final reports will be subject to review by \nthe Government, and ADB. All reports are to be written in English and translated into Chinese. \nOutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants engaged through a firm. A total of \n8 person-months  of  international  consultancy  services  and  42  person-months  of  national \nconsultancy services will be required. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsulting firm will be selected by (i) inviting simplified technical proposals; and (ii) using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\ue83acost weighting of 80:20. The office \nequipment provided under the TA for the consultants will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will be handed over to MWR \nand  the  implementing  agencies  upon  TA  completion.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be \nundertaken in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants. \nAdvance payment procedures will be adopted to facilitate timely implementation of activities \nrelated  to  training,  seminars,  and  conferences.  ADB  funds  for  training,  seminars,  and \nconferences  will  be  transferred  to  an  existing  bank  account  of  MWR  and  managed  and \nliquidated by the director of the TMO. ADB will undertake intensive review and supervision by ", "  5\nfielding missions at critical stages of TA implementation, particularly at inception, midterm, and \nfinal stages, and extending regular support from both the headquarters and the resident mission. \nIV.
