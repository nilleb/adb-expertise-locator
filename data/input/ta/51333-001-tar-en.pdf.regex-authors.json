INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will create knowledge products that \nenhance the tools for conducting macroeconomic assessments at Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) headquarters. These products will be disseminated to developing member countries \n(DMCs), and ADB will support capacity building to provide DMC government officials with a \ndeeper understanding of the patterns and sources of macroeconomic fluctuations. TA outputs will \ninform policy dialogue between ADB and its DMCs on macroeconomic management in Asian \neconomies. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the management-approved annual work program for the Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department as a research activity on monitoring and \nevaluating macroeconomic stability in DMCs. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In line with ADB\u2019s mission to serve as a partner and an agent for change in Asia and the \nPacific, ADB must continue to expand its role as a knowledge bank that facilitates dialogue on \nimportant economic issues and policies among member countries. Recognizing the importance \nof macroeconomic stability in supporting other objectives such as inclusive growth and poverty \nreduction; and considering the rapidly changing global and regional economic environment, ADB \nmust  strengthen  its  capacity  to  conduct  timely  macroeconomic  assessment,  deepen  its \nunderstanding of sources of volatility and risk, and improve the quality of policy dialogues with \nDMCs.  \n \n4.  Previous efforts by ADB\u2019s research department to enhance macroeconomic assessment \nset-up a tool kit to gauge economic conditions in real time and forecast future developments. \nThese tools, global projection model1 for example, are periodically used in evaluations and \nanalyses. The regional TA project Macroeconomic Modeling for Improved Economic Assessment \nlaid the groundwork for undertaking periodic and timely monitoring of economic growth in DMCs.2  \nAmong other tools, the regional TA project developed \u201cnowcasting\u201d\u2014a methodology that uses a \nvariety of indicators to provide real-time updates on GDP growth. These updates, in turn, can be \nused to forecast short-term movements of aggregate economic activities. \n \n5.  The regional TA has supported 16 global baseline forecasts for Asian Development \nOutlook (ADO) publications since 2014, using the global projection model to inform ADB\u2019s \nregional  assessments.  ADB  also  used  this  model  to  conduct  simulations  to  assess  the \nimplications of different risks, such as soft and hard landing scenarios of growth in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, published in an ADB report3; and the risk of a sharper-than-expected interest \nrate hike in the United States, published in the 2017 ADO.4 Indonesia Resident Mission has been \nusing the nowcasting model to support their growth forecasting since Q1 2016.  ADB conducted \nworkshops on monitoring economic growth to disseminate ADB work and facilitate the exchange \nof  experiences  among  DMCs.  ADB  conducted  other  workshops  on  applying  financial \nprogramming  and  policy,  and forecasting  macroeconomic trends  using  limited  data. These \nactivities strengthened the capacity of ADB and DMCs to conduct macroeconomic assessment, \n                                                \n1 The global projection model was developed by the International Monetary Fund and maintained by the Global \nProjection Model Network, a team with expertise in forecasting and macromodeling.  \n2 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Macroeconomic Modeling for Improved Economic Assessment. Manila.  \n3 ADB 2016.

Asian Development Outlook: Transcending the Middle-Income Challenge. Manila.  \n ", "2 \nand reinforced the importance of keeping the tool kit up-to-date to ensure that policy dialogue \nremained relevant. \n \n6.  The growth cycle of an economy\u2014whether it is on an upswing, downswing, or turning \npoint\u2014is another crucial factor to consider when making policy recommendations.  In line with an \ninitial assessment of business cycles carried out under the earlier regional TA project, the \nknowledge  and  support  TA  project  will  further  study  macroeconomic  fluctuations  in  Asian \neconomies to support ADB\u2019s objective of enhancing macroeconomic stability in DMCs.  \n \n7.  Developing economies in Asia experience frequent ups and downs in economic activity, \nwhich can create uncertainty for consumption and investment decisions, hamper growth and \nobstruct development objectives. Economies are exposed to frequent shocks, the nature and \nimpact of which are still not fully understood. Because of weak data and other constraints, one\u2019s \ncapacity to monitor fluctuations and predict macroeconomic cycles is also limited. A turbulent \nglobal economic environment creates additional challenges for those tasked with making accurate \nshort-term forecasts.  \n \n8.  The  above  factors  limit  one\u2019s  understanding  of  which  institutions,  instruments,  and \ninterventions are most effective in promoting stability and reducing vulnerability to shocks. While \nsome volatility is normal in market-oriented economies, the challenge for policy makers is to \nimprove their ability to forecast and understand this volatility so that they can mitigate it through \npolicy measures. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved environment for policy dialogue with \nDMCs. The TA will have the following outcome: informed policy advice provided to DMCs through \ntimely  assessment  of  macroeconomic  trends  and  deeper  understanding  of  sources  of \nfluctuations.5 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Tools to monitor macroeconomic developments and analyze potential \nchanges to ADB forecasts are enhanced. Building on previous TA projects, the  knowledge \nand support TA will improve macroeconomic assessment at ADB by (i) maintaining and extending \nmonitoring activities from the earlier regional TA project, including subscription to CEIC Data \nCompany; and (ii) undertaking research to understand the dynamics of economic cycles over time \nbased on the chronology of business cycle turning points established under the earlier regional \nTA.  The  TA  will  develop  empirical  and  structural  tools  to  better  explain  macroeconomic \nfluctuations as inputs to policy analysis. Besides identifying the types of shocks that cause cycles, \nthe models can also be used to identify which policies might effectively shorten an economic \nslowdown or lengthen an expansion; and stabilize excessive fluctuations in economic activity. \nUnder the TA, the project team will select DMCs in Southeast Asia and East Asia as pilot cases \nfor trialing economic monitoring tools. If the need arises and if sufficient data is available, the TA \nwill consider extending these tools to economies in other subregions. ADB will publish the \nresearch and working papers and technical reports on its website. The updated analysis of \nbusiness cycles will support the ADO publication series. \n                                                \n5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n \n11.  Output  2:    Baseline  of  global  economic  environment  and  Asian  economies \nassessed. ADB will continue to use the global projection model and nowcasting tools to analyze \ntrends in the global economic environment and in DMCs. These analyses, in turn, will inform \nADB\u2019s regional assessments such as the ADO publication series. In addition, the project team \nwill apply the business cycle analysis to assess economic cycles in the near term and gauge \npotential  risks  surrounding  these  cycles.  The  project  team  will  select  DMCs  during  TA \nimplementation based on the availability of economic data. Technical reports and working papers \ncreated under this output will be published on the ADB website. Baseline scenarios for major \nindustrialized  economies  and  assessment  of  potential  risks  surrounding  macroeconomic \nfluctuations will be part of the supporting materials for the ADO publication series and other ADB \ndocuments. \n \n12.  Output 3:  Capacity of ADB developing member countries to conduct economic \nassessments  enhanced.  The  TA  project  team  will  conduct  training  programs,  seminars, \nworkshops, and other capacity-building events for central bank and government officials in DMCs. \nThese events will improve economic monitoring capacity within DMCs as well as improve the \nability of ADB staff to conduct policy dialogue with DMCs. To disseminate knowledge and results \nto a wider audience, ADB staff will participate in external forums and conferences as resource \npersons, and will develop collaborations and knowledge partnerships to contribute to global best \npractices and enhance ADB\u2019s visibility as a knowledge bank. These activities will be articulated \nin post-mission reports. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Macroeconomics Research Division of the Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department will be directly responsible for TA administration \nand supervision, management of consultants, procurement, and accomplishment of outputs. \nKnowledge partnerships may be considered in the implementation of this TA and will be done in \naccordance with the Staff Instruction on Business Processes for Knowledge Partnerships under \nTechnical Assistance Operations, whenever appropriate.6 The project will be implemented from \nJuly 2018 and will be completed by June 2020.  \n \n15.
