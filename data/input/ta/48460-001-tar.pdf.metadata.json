INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) is included in the country \noperations business plan, 2015\u20132017 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). Dialogue with the Ministry of Finance and the Development Research \nCenter (DRC) of the State Council clarified the policy and institutional context, and the priorities \nfor ADB support. \n \n2.  Agreement was reached with the Government of the PRC on the TA project\u2019s impact, \noutcome, output, implementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix \n3.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Effective economic policies in the PRC since the introduction of reform and opening up \nin 1978 have sustained economic growth and social development at an unprecedented pace. \nHowever, rapid growth has come at a cost. Excessive reliance on investment, exports, and \nindustrial development has created structural constraints that need to be addressed. Moreover, \nperiods of high growth in emerging economies come to an end, requiring economic restructuring \nto sustain growth through productivity increases. \n \n4.  To meet these challenges, the government has acknowledged the importance of the \nbalance between the government and the market in guiding structural reform. The Decision on \nMajor Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms that followed the Third Plenum \nof the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized the leadership\u2019s \ncommitment to assign a decisive role to the market in the allocation of resources. \n \n5.  To  promote  the  role  of  the  market,  the  government  pledged  focus  on  ensuring \nmacroeconomic stability and the adequate provision of public services, limiting the scope of its \nintervention  to  areas  of  market  failure.  This  vision  underpins  government  efforts  to  foster \ninnovation-driven growth and greater private sector participation in the economy, which are \nessential to increase productivity growth to help the PRC achieve higher income levels. \n \n6.  This important decision is consistent with international evidence suggesting that private \nsector  participation  is  a  fundamental  engine  of  long-term  growth.  Structural  reforms  are \ntherefore needed to maximize the use of public resources while allowing the market to play a \ndecisive role as a driver of growth. The current weakness of the global economy adds urgency \nto implementing these reforms. \n \n7.  Against this background, a sound private sector is critical to sustain growth. While the \nprivate sector has become the largest source of gross domestic product and employment \ngeneration, its economic dynamism is hampered by limited access to production factors, in \nparticular financial resources. Moreover, state monopolies and weak competition policies often \nlimit  barriers  to  entry  for  private  enterprises.  Equal  access  to  factor  markets  and  fairer \ncompetition policies are required to unleash the full potential of the private sector, which would \nlead to productivity increases and greater employment opportunities in the PRC. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 March 2015. \n ", "2   \n8.  In  contrast,  profitability  and  productivity  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  have \ndeclined, despite their privileged access to factor markets. Some SOEs run at a loss, as they \nare  constrained  by  inefficient  managerial  practices  and  financial  burdens  stemming  from \nregulated prices and costly public service delivery, which the private sector could provide more \neffectively. Nevertheless, the decision identifies the public and private sectors as important \ncomponents of the socialist market economy, and it views both as essential to supporting \ninclusive economic and social development to achieve a harmonious society by 2020, a key \ngovernment target. \n \n9.  Against this background, accelerating reform of SOEs is one of the government\u2019s reform \npriorities. Policy actions should include efforts to diversify ownership of SOEs, improve their \ngovernance structure, upgrade managerial standards, and lift their productivity and profitability \nlevels. It  would  also  be  necessary to focus  their  intervention  in  the economy  on  selected \nsectors, including support to emerging strategic industries, environmental protection, innovation, \nand national security. \n \n10.  Both SOEs and private enterprises would benefit from increased competition, so reforms \nshould  target  lowering  barriers  to  entry  and  exit,  including  dismantling  monopolies  and \noligopolies  in  key  industries  (i.e.,  telecommunications,  power,  and  financial  services),  and \nincreasing oversight and efficiency of natural monopolies. \n \n11.  Reform of factor markets (capital, labor, and land) is critical to increased competition. \nChanges  are  needed  to  ensure  equal  access  to  production  factors  for  optimal  resource \nallocation to boost productivity and sustain growth. Regarding capital, further finance sector \nliberalization is vital to develop a financial system that supports the needs of the real economy. \nRegarding labor, accelerating plans to gradually phase out the hukou (household registration) \nsystem  and  advance  the  portability  of  pensions  and  social  security  benefits  is  crucial  to \nincreasing labor market mobility. Regarding land, as emphasized in the decision, market-driven \nallocation of resources should also apply to land rights of rural residents to increase rural \nincome and close the rural\u2013urban divide. \n \n12.  Successful structural transformation will require institutional changes that redefine the \nrole of the government in the economy and the scope of its intervention. This must ensure equal \naccess  to  factor  markets  irrespective  of  ownership  type  and  business  size,  and  greater \ncompetition between public and private enterprises. Allowing the market to play a decisive role \nin the areas identified under this TA project will result in higher productivity levels and increased \neconomic efficiency to sustain inclusive growth in the PRC in the longer term. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be the greater role of the market in resource allocation. Allowing the \nmarket to play a decisive role in resource allocation, while redefining government functions \ntoward a service-oriented approach, will underpin efforts to rebalance the sources of growth and \nmake growth more inclusive. Greater reliance on private sector participation, a fundamental \nengine of long-term growth, will facilitate the country\u2019s transition to higher income status. The \noutcome will be the increased competition between public and private enterprises. Actions to \nensure a level playing field for private enterprises through fairer competition policies will result in \ngreater  private  sector  participation  in  the  economy.  This  will  lead  to  increased  economic \nefficiency and higher productivity levels in the PRC\u2019s economy, which are essential to sustain \n ", "  3 \ngrowth in the longer term. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The output will be a report containing specific policy recommendations to support the \ndecisive role of the market in resource allocation in the PRC. A policy brief targeting senior \npolicy  decision  makers  in  the  PRC  will  be  also  prepared,  highlighting  key  policy \nrecommendations to guide the implementation of the identified reform priorities. The report will \ncomprise three subreports. \n \n15.  Subreport 1 will focus on policy directions to diversify ownership in SOEs, improve the \ngovernance structure, upgrade managerial standards, and increase productivity and efficiency \nlevels. Measures to limit intervention in the economy by SOEs to allow the market a decisive \nrole in resource allocation will be also analyzed. \n \n16.  Subreport 2 will examine changes  in industrial policy to lower firms\u2019 entry and exit \nbarriers, enabling the break-up of administrative monopolies, and increasing the oversight and \nefficiency of natural monopolies to enhance market competition. In addition, the subreport will \nlook into complementary reforms to increase competition and create a level playing field for the \npublic and private sectors to compete on an equal basis. \n \n17.  Subreport 3 will focus on factor market reforms to ensure equal access to production \nfactors regardless of ownership type. Capital market reforms will include measures to liberalize \nthe finance sector (i.e., allowing private capital to set up small- or medium-sized banks). Labor \nmarket reforms will ensure labor moves to where it generates the highest returns. Increased \nlabor market flexibility will also allow the workforce to adjust to changing market conditions. \nLand reform will focus on land tenure, land use, land revenue, and its use as collateral. \n \n18.  The report will be prepared under the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach. Expertise and resources \nfrom both ADB and the ADB Institute will be tapped throughout the project. In addition to the \nthree subreports, supplementary reports on finance sector liberalization and labor market reform \nwill be prepared by ADB staff. Insights will be also provided by the ADB Institute on urbanization, \nas  land  and  labor  market  reforms  will  have  important  implications  in  the  pace  of  urban \ndevelopment. \n \n19.  The  implementing  agency  will  (i)  organize  an  international  study  tour  focusing  on \ncountries in Asia that have been successful in the focus area, and (ii) prepare a short report \noutlining its contents and findings. The related output of the study tour will be incorporated in the \ndraft final report. \n \n20.  The TA will disseminate research findings and policy recommendations through three \nnational workshops (inception, midterm review, and final review) and a final dissemination event \nto present key findings and policy suggestions to a wider audience. \n \n21.  The main assumption is the government remains committed to undertaking reforms that \ngive the market a decisive role in the allocation of resources to sustain economic growth in the \nlonger term. The main risks are limited access to key data, and postponement of structural \nreforms amid economic growth moderation in the PRC. \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space,  accommodation,  transport, \nremuneration, per diem of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months, from 1 June 2015 to 30 January 2017. The \nDepartment of International Cooperation of the DRC of the State Council will be the executing \nagency for the TA. The Department of Industrial Economy of the DRC of the State Council will \nbe the implementing agency. The executing agency will be responsible for establishing and \nchairing  a  TA  steering  committee  composed  of  experts  and  representatives  of  relevant \nministries and agencies. The steering committee will be regularly consulted and invited to \nparticipate in TA activities. \n \n24.  In dialogue with the executing agency, ADB will recruit national and international experts \nto provide inputs as individual consultants. A total of 32 person-months of individual consulting \nservices  (six  national  consultants  for  a  total  of  30  person-months,  and  one  international \nconsultant for 2 person-months) will be selected based on their academic qualifications and \nrelevant work experience. Given the required expertise, national and international consultants \nwill be selected and engaged on an individual basis by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). To reduce administrative \nburden and improve economy and efficiency, consulting services under the TA will be engaged \non output-based lump-sum contracts. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n25.  The consultant team will be responsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables in \na timely and effective manner, and for organizing and carrying out all TA activities. Consultants \nwill report to the assigned ADB project officer, and all outputs and reports will be prepared in \nEnglish. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n26.  TA  support  for  workshops  may  include  costs  related  to  venue,  equipment  rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, food and beverages, transportation, lodging, logistics and \nadministrative support, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with \nstandard ADB procedures, the TA will not support the implementing agency\u2019s management fees \nor related costs such as staff salaries and allowances, and the use of implementing agency \nresources (such as office accommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart \ncontribution. \n \n27.  The executing agency will provide a suitably furnished office with computers, utilities, \nand telecommunications access (including broadband internet connection). It will also supply \ndata, and documents as required under the TA, and it will cover the cost of office utilities for \nconsultants. The executing agency will designate a TA focal point with strong English speaking \nand writing skills, and will facilitate all TA activities and links to local government representatives \nand providers to ensure the effective implementation of TA activities. \n \n28.  The TA will have project-specific indicators and targets, including timely implementation \nand quality progress reports. Policy dialogue will be maintained with the government and the \n ", "  5 \nsteering  committee  of  experts  established  by  the  executing  agency.  Consultation  and \ndissemination events will be organized at different implementation stages of the TA. Project-\nspecific  issues  will  be  addressed  during  review  missions.  Milestones  related  to  the \nimplementation of the TA will be monitored by ADB and the team leader. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nIV.
