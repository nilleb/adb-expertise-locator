The country strategy and program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Solomon \nIslands aims to contribute to rapid, pro-poor, and private sector-led economic growth. It foresees \nsupport  to  the  Government  by  providing  transportation  infrastructure  and  services  and \nstrengthening the enabling environment for the private sector. Private sector participation in, \nand reform of, the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector are high-priority areas, in which ADB \nhas had a history of support to Solomon Islands. The Government has recognized the vital role \nthe private sector must play in the rehabilitation of the economy. The economic rehabilitation \nand development process led by the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands \n(RAMSI) is providing a unique window of opportunity for public and private sector reforms.  \n \n2.  During ADB's 2004 Country Programming Mission, which coincided with the TA Fact- \nFinding Mission, it was agreed with the Government that ADB will provide technical assistance \n(TA) in support of developing and implementing privatization policies and reforms, private sector \nparticipation, and SOE performance improvement.1 The Government concurs with the TA's \ngoal, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms \nof reference. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  As part of the 1998 Public Sector Reform Program in Solomon Islands, ADB provided a \nTA loan to support implementation of the Government\u2019s privatization policy.2 The TA loan was \ndesigned to help privatize selected SOEs, improve the financial performance of SOEs that \nwould  remain  under  government  ownership,  and  develop  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks for those sectors in which the privatized SOEs would operate. While the TA loan \nwas generally regarded as successful during its implementation, the 2000 coup d'etat resulted \nin the cancellation of the project and made its outputs obsolete. However, RAMSI, fielded in \nJune 2003, has helped the Government restore law and order and fiscal discipline, and  embark \non  the  national  economic  recovery,  reform,  and  development  program.  The  country's \ndevelopment  partners  are  strongly  supportive  of  the  process,  and  ADB  has  taken  on  a \nsubstantial role in the focus areas of its assistance.  \n \n4.   Economic reforms to address major constraints on the sustainable growth of private \nsector income-earning opportunities have been an important pillar of the RAMSI-led process. A \nnumber of key strategies include SOE reforms and privatization, development of transport \ninfrastructure and utilities, private sector regulatory reforms, financial sector reforms, provision \nof policy and governance advice to provincial governments, and formulation of sectoral policies \nto promote investment and growth, among others. To assist in formulating and implementing \neconomic reforms, an Economic Reform Unit (ERU) was established within the Ministry of \nFinance, National Reform and Planning. ADB's country strategy and program is geared toward \nsupporting  ERU's  operations  in  cooperation  with  other  sources,  especially  in  the  areas  of \nprivatization and SOE reforms, infrastructure policy and regulation, and legal and regulatory \nbusiness environment. \n \n5.  Solomon Islands has 17 SOEs, including statutory authorities; air transport services; \ntelecoms (with a recently renewed 15-year monopoly concession); resource-based enterprises \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 16 July 2004. \n2 ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Technical \nAssistance Loan to Solomon Islands for the Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises. Manila.  \n ", "2  \nin forestry, fishing, and agricultural production; and service providers in areas such as ship \nrepair  and  maintenance,  printing,  tourism  promotion,  and  export  marketing.  Weak  SOE \nmanagement combined with ineffective SOE corporate governance regimes has resulted in \npoor service delivery and financial performance, posing a heavy burden on public finances, \nbusinesses and consumers alike. The Investment Corporation of Solomon Islands (ICSI), which \nis the management and oversight authority for some of the SOEs, has not been in a position to \nfulfill its mandate effectively. Generally, corporate governance standards have not worked well \nin the country\u2019s SOE sector and, with few exceptions, the technical, commercial, and financial \nSOE performance has been deteriorating over the last decade.  \n \n6.  While it is recognized that the per unit cost of producing public goods on a relatively \nsmall  scale  is  high,  the  experience  of  Solomon  Islands  as  well  as  internationally  strongly \nsuggests  that  governments  and  inadequately  regulated  monopolies  produce  services  at \nunnecessarily high costs and usually of low quality. Considering its unsuccessful history in \nproviding basic utilities, infrastructure, and commercial services, the Government has decided to \nfocus more on its core purposes by reducing, to the extent possible and feasible, its involvement \nin commercial activities and those activities that can more effectively and efficiently be provided \nby the private sector.  \n \n7.  Reform of the SOEs will need to consider various options for improving performance, \nincluding better management, corporatization, and privatization within an appropriate regulatory \nframework. Appropriate regulation and management of SOEs are essential to improve the \nquality of service and to run operations in a sustainable manner. Consideration should be given \nto introducing private sector participation and competition in hitherto public (and semiprivate) \nmonopolies.  It  is  important  to  base  SOE-specific  decisions  on  a  sound  policy  on  SOE \nownership, performance, and divestment, as well as on effective regulatory frameworks.  \n \n8.  The TA will support ERU in building on  progress made during the privatization exercises \nassociated  with  the  1998  Public  Sector  Reform  Program,  and  strengthening  government \ncapacity to implement SOE reforms. It will be closely coordinated with activities under the \nsecond ADB country assistance focus area\u2014transportation infrastructure and services\u2014as well \nas with relevant activities of other aid agencies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The goal of the TA is to support the Government in its efforts to improve the environment \nfor the private sector, in line with the strategic focus of ADB's country strategy and program for \nSolomon  Islands.  The  purpose  is  to  assist  the  Government  to  improve  SOE  ownership \narrangements, accountability, and performance. The TA outputs are (i) a sound government \npolicy  on  SOE  ownership,  performance,  and  divestment;  (ii)  private  sector  participation  in \nprioritized SOEs (including full privatization); (iii) adequate legal and regulatory frameworks for \nthose sectors in which privatized SOEs will operate; (iv) reporting and performance monitoring \nregime for SOEs that will remain under State ownership; and (v) on-the-job training for key \nstakeholders in government and SOEs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have four interlinked components: (i) SOE ownership policy, strategy, and \nlegal and regulatory frameworks; (ii) privatization (including private sector participation); (iii) \n ", "  3\nSOE  reporting  and  performance  monitoring  regime;  and  (iv)  capacity  building  for  local \ncounterparts at ERU, relevant ministries, and SOEs.  \n \n11.  TA activities under each component will be closely aligned with ERU's work program and \nstaff capacities. The TA will include, but will not be limited to, the following key activities:  \n \n(i)  Analyze the status quo of the SOE portfolio, including the current reporting and \nmonitoring regime. \n(ii)  Develop an effective SOE ownership and performance policy and a privatization \nroad  map,  and  achieve  reform  ownership  through  an  intensive  high-level \nconsultation process. \n(iii)  Review the role of ICSI, and recommend longer-term institutional arrangements \nfor SOE oversight and monitoring. \n(iv)  Develop and implement regulatory frameworks for sectors in which privatized \nSOEs operate. \n(v)  Implement the privatization of selected SOEs. \n(vi)  Develop and implement systems and measures to improve accountability and \nperformance of SOEs remaining in public ownership \n(vii)  Develop  and  introduce  appropriate  systems  and  guidelines  for  managing \ncommunity service obligations. \n(viii)  Improve SOE board composition and appointments. \n(ix)  Conduct  on-the-job  training  in  privatization  and  SOE  management  for \ngovernment officials and SOE staff. \n(x)  Lead  a  comprehensive  consultation  process;  develop  and  implement  public \ninformation campaigns on the need for service delivery reforms. \n \n12.  The TA will take into consideration the Government's broader development and sector \npriorities,  Government  and  SOEs  capacity  constraints,  and  political  realities,  and  will \ncomplement other relevant aid activities with respect to SOE reforms. In particular, TA activities \nwill be coordinated with closely related World Bank-assisted TAs for reform and regulation of \ninfrastructure utilities. While World Bank assistance will focus on SOE internal reforms, the ADB \nTA  will  provide  perspective  for  the  more  strategic  and  policy-oriented  SOE  portfolio \nmanagement. The TA will also complement a separate ADB TA for interisland transportation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent, comprising $684,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $316,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $800,000 \nequivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $116,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost on a grant basis, of which $300,000 will be financed by ADB's TA funding \nprogram  and  $500,000  by  the  Government  of  Australia,  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The \nGovernment of Solomon Islands will finance the remaining $200,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs for counterpart staff salaries, office accommodation at ERU, support services, \nand transport. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Department of Finance and Treasury of the Ministry of Finance, National Reform \nand Planning will be the Executing Agency. The permanent secretary of Finance will provide \noverall guidance in TA implementation. The consultants will work on a day-to-day basis with \nERU and individual SOEs, as required. ERU will help facilitate consultations with SOEs. A \n ", "4  \nsteering committee will be established to help build consensus and drive the reform process. \nThe  steering  committee  will  be  headed  by  the  permanent  secretary  of  the  Department  of \nFinance  and  Treasury,  and  members  include  senior  officials  from  relevant  government \ndepartments, selected SOEs, and representatives of the private sector and civil society.  \n \n15.  Through  a  consulting  firm,  consulting  services  (24  person-months  international,  18 \nperson-months domestic) will be engaged using the simplified technical proposal following the \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures. The international consultant team will consist of a \nprivatization specialist (team leader, 9 person-months), a corporate governance and financial \nspecialist (8 person-months), and legal and regulatory experts specializing in transactions and \nregulatory  frameworks  (7  person-months  total).  The  international  consultant  team  will  be \ncomplemented by domestic financial and legal experts on an as-needed basis (18 person-\nmonths total). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The team of \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n16.  The TA will begin in March 2005 and be implemented over 24 months until February \n2007, with intermittent inputs from the international and domestic consultants. Within 4 weeks of  \nthe fielding of consultants, the team leader will submit an inception report to be discussed during \na tripartite meeting with the Government and ADB. Progress reports will be submitted to ADB \nand the Government on a quarterly basis and detailed progress reports semiannually. Brief \nmission reports will be submitted (by E-mail) after each consultant field visit. A midterm report \nwill be discussed during a second tripartite meeting. The Consultant\u2019s draft final report will be \ndiscussed during the third tripartite meeting. The final report, incorporating the comments of  the \nGovernment and ADB, will be submitted within 4 weeks of the third tripartite meeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Solomon \nIslands  for  State-Owned  Enterprise  Reforms  and  Private  Sector  Participation,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators and    and Risks \nTargets   \n \nGoal       \n       \nImprove the  Increased private  Government statistics and   \nenvironment for the  sector share of gross  economic reports   \nprivate sector  domestic product \n  (GDP) \nPurpose       \n       \nImprove state-owned  SOE ownership and  Government reports on  Private sector is generally \nenterprise (SOE)  performance policy  new policy framework  more effective and efficient \nownership  formulated and    in delivering commercial \narrangements,  operational    goods and services.  \naccountability, and       \nperformance  Privatization of   Government reports,  Government remains \nselected SOEs, in  media releases  committed to the reform \naccordance with SOE    plans. \nownership and     \nperformance policy and    Reform measures are \ndue process    supported by Government \n    and SOEs. \nImproved financial and  SOE reports; reports to   \nservice delivery  Parliament; audit reports,   \nperformance of SOEs  budget papers; interviews \nremaining in  with officials from SOE \ngovernment ownership  oversight body, SOEs, and \n  private sector \nMore effective  representatives (by [ADB] \ncorporate governance  review missions) \nof those SOEs \nremaining in \ngovernment ownership \n \nOutputs       \n       \n1.
