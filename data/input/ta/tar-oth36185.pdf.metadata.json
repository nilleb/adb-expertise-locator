INTRODUCTION \n1.  A  Fact-Finding  Mission  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  visited  Brunei \nDarussalam,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Philippines  in  September  2002  to  consult  with \ngovernment agencies and business communities in the four countries. In the course of the \ndiscussions, consensus was reached on the pressing need for technical assistance (TA) to \ndevelop a strategic blueprint to revalidate sector/project priorities of the Brunei Darussalam, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines-East ASEAN1 Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) in response \nto  the  changing  environment  of  development  and  emerging  challenges  associated  with \nglobalization.2 Understanding was also reached on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  cost  estimates.  The  TA  is  included  in  the  Subregional \nCooperation Strategy and Program for Southeast Asia.3  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  To  promote  subregional  economic  and  trade  activities,  the  governments  of  Brunei \nDarussalam,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Philippines  in  1994  formally  launched  an  economic \ncooperation initiative, BIMP-EAGA.4 The fundamental goal of BIMP-EAGA is to realize equitable \nand  sustainable  economic  development  based  on  high  value-added  agro-industry,  natural \nresources-based manufacturing, and high-grade tourism.  \n3.  BIMP-EAGA was a dynamic and active subregional initiative during the early years of its \ninception.  ADB\u2019s  early  support  for  BIMP-EAGA  was  provided  through  a  comprehensive \ninvestigative study prepared in 1995-1996.5 The study aimed to help mobilize the potential of \nsubregional economic cooperation for the development of BIMP-EAGA, highlighting the EAGA \nprofile, setting up short- and long-term development visions and strategies, and developing a \nframework for implementation and monitoring. Along with other important findings, the study \nindicated  that  there  were  \u201csignificant  investment  opportunities  based  on  latent  economic \ncomplementation and other forms of regional economic cooperation.\u201d It also provided a list of \ninvestment and trade project proposals. \n4.  However, the implementation of the proposals in the study received a setback from the \nAsian economic crisis that began in 1997 and the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon that hit most of the \nsubregion in 1998. There were also changes in political leaderships and growing concerns of \nsecurity, peace, and order in some of the BIMP-EAGA member countries. A new international \neconomic situation is emerging which will have important implications for the BIMP-EAGA \nmember countries. In recent years, the Southeast Asian economies, including those of BIMP-\nEAGA, have witnessed a weakening of demand for their exports in major international markets. \nAmid growing intratrade and investment activities in Asia, the People\u2019s Republic of China has \nenlarged as a major regional destination for trade and investment. Production restructuring, \nchanges in consumption pattern, and technological improvement are also occurring regionwise \n                                                 \n1  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in July 2002. \n3  ADB.  2002.  Subregional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program  Status  Report:  Southeast  Asia.  IN225-02, \n19 September. Manila. \n4  Subregion refers to a group of adjacent areas crossing national boundaries and involving full or part of national \neconomies.  The  BIMP-EAGA  includes  Brunei  Darussalam  (whole  area),  Indonesia  (the  provinces  of  North \nSulawesi, East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, Maluku, Irian Jaya, South and Central Kalimantan, Southeast and \nCentral Sulawesi, Southeast and South Sulawesi), Malaysia (Sabah, Sarawak, and Labuan), and Philippines \n(Mindanao and Palawan regions). \n5  ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance to Study the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines-East \nASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA). Manila. ", "2 \namid increasing globalization and growing regional economic integration in East and Southeast \nAsia.6 \n5.  Improved prospects for regional cooperation and the successfully managing the risks of \nglobalization are recognized as key in reviving subregional cooperation. Concerns on how \nBIMP-EAGA should respond to or adapt to the new economic environment were discussed at \nthe Senior Officials Meeting held in Manado, Indonesia, on 8\u20139 August 2002, which called for \nimmediate attention to the following two aspects.  \n6.  The first is to deepen understanding of the impact of the changing global and regional \nenvironment on BIMP-EAGA and implications for reviving the subregional cooperation initiatives. \nThe impact and implications of these changes are multidimensional. Economically, one of the \nkey issues is to identify the comparative advantage of BIMP-EAGA and to exploit it for tapping a \nlarger market space. On top of the policy agenda, policy parameters and incentive schemes for \ntrade and investment will need to be developed and encouraged to support priority sectors and \nprojects. Institution-wise, the changing context in Asia and the world imposes challenges for \nboth public and private institutions in establishing a more effective partnership to facilitate factor \nand product flows and improve investor services. The role of local authorities in developing an \nenabling  environment  for  trade  and  investment  is  particularly  important,  considering  the \ndeepening decentralization process in Indonesia and the Philippines.7 An updated assessment \nof EAGA\u2019s strategic framework is needed based on a better understanding of constraints, \nprospects, and priorities in the subregion.  \n7.  The second is how to prioritize the emerging opportunities for cross-border cooperation \nactivities to achieve tangible results for BIMP-EAGA in a short period of time, based on the \nprevious  experiences  and  clearer  understanding  of  the  prospects  of  the  subregion.  The \nprevailing  view  is  that  the  rich  potential  in  agrobusiness,  and  ecotourism  together  with \nsupporting infrastructure should remain the main focus, but there is no consensus as to how to \nmake it happen and where to start. To move forward, sector assessments are needed to have a \nbetter basis for dialogue on project-specific policy parameters and regulatory incentives. To \nimprove  the  enabling  environment  for  project-based  investments  for  promoting  subregional \neconomic  cooperation,  cross-border  interactions  among  concerned  public  and  private \ninstitutions need to be strengthened. Finally, analytical and technical inputs including identifying \nviable project opportunities, formulating project concepts, and preparing prefeasibility studies for \nselected projects or programs are also required.  \n8.  Since the beginning, ADB has supported BIMP-EAGA through continuous engagement \nwith the participating countries, policy dialogue, and technical assistance. In March 2002, ADB \naccepted the invitation of the ASEAN Secretariat to be the regional development advisor to \nBIMP-EAGA.  The  current  subregional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  calls  for  a  more \nvigorous support to BIMP-EAGA.8 To begin with, advisory assistance is necessary to pave the \nway for concrete project interventions and to examine the need for the required policy and \nregulatory  changes.  To  revive  BIMP-EAGA  through  enhanced  economic  activities  in  the \n                                                 \n6  Members of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in January 2002 agreed to lower the intraregional tariff rates to \n0-5% among the ASEAN original six (Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and \nThailand). Another example, at the 7th ASEAN Summit in November 2001, at Brunei Darussalam, the ASEAN \nleaders agreed to create an ASEAN-CHINA Free Trade Area in 10 years time. \n7  The issue of institutional support at the local level is also relevant in Malaysia, which is under a federal \nadministration system. \n8  ADB.  2002.

", "  3\nsubregion, there is a need to closely examine both short- and long-term development needs and \nmake BIMP-EAGA more responsive to the changing economic environment. Such a study will \nprovide inputs to a more realistic and pragmatic subregional development framework that can \nbe supported by BIMP-EAGA governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA aims to support the participating countries in preparing a development blueprint \nfor reviving and sustaining economic cooperation in BIMP-EAGA, with refocused thrusts and \npriorities in response to the changing environment and emerging challenges. The TA will assist \nin  reviewing  and  updating  EAGA\u2019s  development  strategy  and  help  identify  achievable \nobjectives, taking the investigative study (ADB. 1996. East ASEAN Growth Area: Investigative \nStudy, Vol. 1, Part I, page 97 and Appendixes, Vol. 2, Part I. Manila) as a basis. The specific \nobjectives  are  to  (i) enhance  understanding  of  the  strengths  and  potentials  for  economic \ncooperation among EAGA countries by reviewing changes in their production structure and \nmarket dynamics and policy and institutional aspects of economic cooperation in the postcrisis \nperiod;  (ii)  prioritize  potential  subregional  cooperation  sectors/programs/projects;  and \n(iii) support  the  preparation  and  formulation  of  project  concepts  and  prefeasibility/feasibility \nstudies for selected projects or programs.   \n10.  The TA output will consist of two interrelated components: (i) a status report identifying \nthe current production structures and marketing network, and exploring the potential of the \nsubregional initiative, to help refine the strategic role to be played by BIMP-EAGA in support of \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction;  and  determine  the  modalities  and  milestones  to \nachieve the short- and long-term objectives of BIMP-EAGA; and (ii) technical reports consisting \nof sector assessment, project conceptualization, and prefeasibility/feasibility studies for selected \npriority projects for subregional economic cooperation. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The following activities and methodologies are envisaged: \n(i)  Stakeholder consultation \nConsult with a broad spectrum of stakeholders to obtain views on development \npotentials  and  priorities,  comparative  advantages,  constraints,  and  short-  to \nmedium-term prospects of BIMP-EAGA and evolve consensus on sector and \nproject prioritization. \n(ii)  Research on prioritizing the strategic direction of BIMP-EAGA \n(a) Assess the impact of the changing environment on BIMP-EAGA (especially \nthe growing trends of globalization and regional economic integration); \n(b) Evaluate production and marketing systems in EAGA countries in terms of \ncompetitiveness  and  capacity  of  the  subregion,  and  relate  them  to  the \nrestructuring of production systems, changing patterns of consumption, and \nadvances of technology in Asia and other parts of the world; \n(c) Identify  and  assess  changes  needed  in  national  policy  and  regulatory \nframeworks  in  trade  and  investment  for  promoting  the  private  sector \nespecially small- and medium-sized enterprises; ", "4 \n(d) Assess the role and capacities of local authorities in developing an enabling \nenvironment for trade and investment and in their interactions with national \ngovernments;  \n(e) Compare and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different groupings of \nBIMP-EAGA  countries  in  terms  of  their  economic  structure  to  provide  a \nconceptual  basis  for  strengthening  bilateral  and  multilateral  economic \ncooperation; and  \n(f)  Suggest  modalities  and  identify  milestones  to  achieve  the  short-  and \nlong-term objectives of BIMP-EAGA. \n \n(iii)  Review and revalidate sector priorities and conceptualize investment projects  \n(a) Review the past performance in project preparation and implementation for \nsubregional projects, based primarily on the 1996 investigative study (ADB. \n1996. East ASEAN Growth Area: Investigative Study, Appendixes, Vol. 2, \nPart I. Manila); \n(b) Assess the development needs of priority sectors and formulate an approach \nto subregional cooperation in these sectors; \n(c) Identify and prioritize potential subregional projects in the selected sectors, \nbased on the updated strategic development framework of BIMP-EAGA; \n(d) Prepare  project  concepts  and  prefeasibility/feasibility  studies  for  selected \nprojects or programs.  \n \n(iv)  Support implementation of the prioritized strategic plans and project proposals in \nselected sectors  \n(a) Conduct  consultative  meetings  with  representatives  of  implementing \nagencies of BIMP-EAGA under the current institutional framework; \n(b) Through  appropriate  mechanism/forums,  build  consensus  among  the \nparticipating countries on priority sectors and sector development strategies; \nand \n(c) Assist in developing implementing plans for high priority project proposals. \n(v)  Provide training and disseminate information  \n(a) Organize  training  seminars  involving  policy  makers,  representatives  of \nbusiness communities, and research workers for awareness of the TA and \nrequired changes in policies and regulations, and to exchange views on best \npractice and lessons learned; and \n(b) Disseminate the major findings and output of the TA. \n \n12.  While Brunei Darussalam is not currently an ADB member, the RETA includes Brunei \nDarussalam as its participation is essential for the objective of the TA to help promote BIMP-\nEAGA. \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 is foreign exchange \ncost  and  $100,000  equivalent  is  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance  the  entire  foreign \nexchange  cost  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  four  participating \ncountries will share the remaining local costs of $100,000 equivalent by providing office space, \nstaff support, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will cover the costs of engaging consulting \nservices (remuneration, per diem, and travel) and preparing study reports. The TA will also \nfinance in-country seminars and workshops for capacity building and dissemination of major TA ", "  5\nfindings  and  output.  As  currently  Brunei  Darussalam  is  not  an  ADB  member,  Brunei \nDarussalam's contribution will include all direct local costs related to the implementation of the \nTA in Brunei Darussalam, excluding the expenses related to the consulting services. Brunei \nDarussalam will also finance its participation in meetings and workshops. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  With  the  assistance  of  a  team  of \nconsultants, ADB staff will work with the government agencies, business communities, and \nresearch institutions in implementing the TA. The TA will be implemented over 10 months \ncommencing  January  2003,  with  completion  in  October  2003.  The  TA  requires  consulting \nservices of 24 person-months to be provided by a consulting firm. The firm will be responsible \nfor the overall conduct of the TA, including providing the services of 3 international (12 person-\nmonths) and 4 domestic consultants (12 person-months). The outline terms of references for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. The consulting firm will be recruited by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants, using the simplified technical proposals procedures under ADB\u2019s quality \ncost based system. Policy dialogue and consultation will be carried out with public institutions, \nprivate sector, as well as other aid agencies. Concerned government agencies of BIMP-EAGA \nwill provide logistic convenience and support including liaising with the consultant team and \nassisting to access required information and data. All procurement of equipment and materials, \nand service payments under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements. \n15.  The consultant team will submit an inception report to ADB within 2 weeks of the start of \nservices. The inception report will (i) focus on initial assessment and prepare a realistic plan for \nsubsequent actions to ensure that the required TA outputs are completed on time; and (ii) make \nadjustments, as appropriate, in other key issues affecting the realization of the TA objectives, \nwhich are to be identified through consultation with government agencies and representatives of \nbusiness  communities.  Draft  final  reports  (position  report  and  technical  reports)  by  the \nconsultant team will be completed in April 2003.9 Consultative meetings and training seminars \nwill  be  conducted  during  TA  implementation.  Training  materials  will  also  be  prepared  as \nrequired. The final TA reports will be completed in August 2003. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nPrioritizing Strategic Directions for BIMP-EAGA, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n9  The draft final report is expected to be available for discussion and consultation during the next BIMP-EAGA Senior \nOfficials Meeting scheduled for April/May 2003.
