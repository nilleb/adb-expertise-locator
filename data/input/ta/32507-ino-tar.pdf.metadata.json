The Government of Indonesia asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical \nassistance (TA) to ensure continuity in policy outcomes of the reform agenda for medium-term \nactions from September 2009 to June 2011. The goal is to attain deeper and more liquid capital \nmarkets, enhance market supervision, and improve regulatory resources and capacity. The \nultimate aims are to improve overall governance standards for capital markets and provide \ngreater  investor  protection.  These  activities  are  critical  to  promote  resilience,  growth,  and \nsustainability  of  capital  markets;  and  make  the  Indonesian  capital  market  more  efficient, \ncompetitive, financially sound, and responsive to global trends.1  \n \n2.   The Indonesia country strategy and program for 2006\u20132009 identifies deepening of the \nfinancial sector to promote enhanced financial sector resilience as one of five key areas of ADB \ninterventions.2 The ADB Capital Market Development Program Cluster (CMDPC)3 evolves from \nthe government\u2019s medium-term development plan (2004\u20132009) to support the government\u2019s \nfinancial sector reform agenda in line with the country strategy and program, and with a principal \nfocus on development of capital markets. A policy reform program (1 January 2006 to October \n2010), under the CMDPC, comprises two subprograms: subprogram 1 from January 2006 to \nSeptember 2007 and subprogram 2 from October 2007 to August 2009.4 The government \nrecognizes that the reform program will need to extend beyond the two subprograms. In line \nwith this, a post-program partnership framework for follow-up policy actions for September \n2009\u2013June 2011 was developed in consultation with various agencies. The government and \nfinancial industry recognize the importance of this capacity-building initiative and discussions \nhave been under way for some time among government agencies, industry associations, and \nlocal universities. The CMDPC aims to support these efforts and lend momentum via the TA, \nwhich will help meet immediate needs and allow for a systematic approach to medium- and \nlonger-term efforts. This report reflects the findings of the mission and understandings reached \nwith the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Financial sector reforms are crucial to raising Indonesia\u2019s growth rate and enhancing the \neconomy\u2019s  resilience. Indonesia\u2019s capital markets are relatively smaller and the secondary \nmarkets less liquid than those of most other Southeast Asian economies. With equity market \ncapitalization at 36% of gross domestic product (GDP) as of October 2009, Indonesia has the \nsmallest market; Hong Kong, China has the largest, followed by Singapore, Republic of Korea, \nMalaysia, People's Republic of China, Philippines, and Thailand. Even for debt markets, based \non total bonds outstanding against GDP in 2008, Indonesia\u2019s ratio of 13.6% places it among the \nsmaller markets in the region. Effective implementation of medium-term action plans relies on \nadequate financial resources and continued support of key agencies such as the capital market \nand nonbank financial institutions regulator, Bapepam-LK, until greater institutional capacity and \nresources are attained. Against the backdrop of clearly defined sector goals and strategies, and \na strong commitment to reform as evidenced by progress achieved during last 3 years, the TA \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 27 November 2009. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nwill help meet immediate needs and allow for a systematic approach to medium- and longer-\nterm  efforts.  The  TA  will  complement  change  management  assistance  being  provided  by \nAustralian Agency for International Development. To attain this goal, 11 main issues were \nidentified for support under the TA.  \n \n4.  Support  implementation  of  the  capital  market  master  plan  (2010\u20132014).  TA \nattached to subprogram 1 of the CMDPC (footnote 3) is assisting Bapepam-LK to develop a \ncapital market master plan for 2010\u20132014. The master plan will provide a clear statement of the \nstrategic philosophy underpinning development efforts in Indonesia's capital markets for the \nnext 5 years, and outline a plan of action incorporating specific recommendations for developing \nthe capital market. Implementation of these recommendations will take into account the optimal \nsequencing for orderly progression to meet the challenges of increasing globalization.  \n \n5.  Support benchmarking for the regulatory framework to harmonize standards and \nregional  cooperation.  Support  is  required  to  assess  the  regulatory  framework  for  areas \ncovered by Bapepam-LK vis-\u00e0-vis other member countries of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), as well as benchmarking with international best practices to promote \nregional cooperation and harmonization of standards. Based on standards of the International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), ASEAN regulators have developed a single \nset  of  common  disclosure  standards  for  cross-border  issuances,  known  as  the  ASEAN \nStandards, together with additional requirements prescribed by each jurisdiction, known as the \nPlus Standards. The overall scheme is envisaged to bring greater efficiency and cost-saving for \nissuers undertaking cross-border offerings once the ASEAN standards are accepted by each \ncountry.  Afterward,  other  aspects  of  Indonesia's  regulatory  framework  will  need  to  be \nbenchmarked to identify areas where complementary measures are needed to give confidence \nto regulators in other countries. Bilateral agreements with Indonesia on common standards can \nthen be made on adequate enforcement and supervisory capabilities in Bapepam-LK \n \n6.  Support strengthening of Bapepam-LK's investigative and enforcement capacity. \nThis will be accomplished by providing necessary training programs and secondments with \nrelevant enforcement and/or regulatory authorities: While considerable progress has been made \nin strengthening the anti-money-laundering regime for banking, the nonbank financial subsector  \ncurrently lags in comparison, in terms of the effectiveness of regulations and supervision, as \nwell as the capacity of institutions to comply with the law. To reduce the risk of nonbank \nfinancial institutions being used as conduits for money laundering, regulations, supervision \n(capacity, enforcement powers, and sanctions), and capacity for compliance will need to be \nstrengthened to achieve parity with the banking system.  \n \n7.  Support the development and implementation of an investor protection fund. This \nwould  include  regulation  of  investor  protection  funds  for  the  securities  market  and  credit \nguarantees. Indonesia does not have an investor protection fund to protect investors in the \nevent of broker default. The rules require securities firms to take out insurance to cover this \neventuality, but such insurance is not available and the rule has not been enforced. This \nexposes investors to significant risk and is likely to deter investors of all sizes from participating \nin the market. Such funds are typically built up by contributions from brokers The CMDPC \nrequires Bapepam-LK to compensate investors in registered investment companies for financial \nloss they may suffer due to reasons prescribed by the regulator other than market decline in the \ninvestment portfolio of the investment company.  \n \n8.  Develop a structured and comprehensive human resource capacity program for \nBapepam-LK. Bapepam-LK will require support over the medium term for it to become an \n ", "         3 \neffective regulator. Governance of regulatory agencies and market institutions requires staff with \ngraduate education in actuarial science and finance, and experience in regulatory practices and \nmarket surveillance in developed markets. Acquiring these skills is a precondition for success, \nbut will be a major challenge, requiring the government to commit adequate resources over the \nmedium and long term if technical and regulatory excellence is to be achieved.  \n \n9.  Support development of a comprehensive database and user-friendly website. The \ncapital market and nonbank financial subsector will benefit greatly from the development of a \nstructured  and  comprehensive  database  and  user-friendly  website  to  provide  consolidated \ncapital  market  and  nonbank  financial  institution  information  in  appropriate  presentations \navailable  in  both  Bahasa  Indonesia  and  English.  Only  through  the  steady  flow  of  timely, \ncomprehensive, and accurate information can people make sound investment decisions. The \nwebsite  should  include  information  on  insurance  and  capital  market  products  and  related \nsubjects.  \n \n10.  Establish a capital markets institute. Bapepam-LK is studying several options to serve \nthe  research  needs  of  capital  markets  and  the  contractual  savings  industries,  including \ndeveloping  and  adopting  a  plan  of  collaboration  with  universities  in  Indonesia.  Resource \ncapacity and skills of the entire capital markets need to be enhanced to operate in a more \ncompetitive environment, hence the need for a centralized capital market training institute to \nfocus  on  capacity  building  for  all  capital  market  sectors.  An  important  milestone  is  the \nmemorandum of understanding under subprogram 2 of the CMDPC in 2009 to initiate the \ncapital markets institute cooperatively by Indonesian Stock Exchange, PT Kliring Penjaminan \nEfek  Indonesia  (Indonesian  Clearing  and  Guarantee  Corporation),  Kustodian  Sentral  Efek \nIndonesia (Indonesian Central Securities Depository), University of Indonesia, and Bapepam-LK \nto provide a focus for undergraduate, graduate, and professional training to develop capital \nmarkets.  \n \n11.  Support reforms likely to be required following reviews under the Financial Sector \nAssessment Program. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are conducting \nthe program to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date diagnosis of Indonesia's finance sector \nvulnerabilities. This is expected to complete by mid 2010. The program seeks to determine how \nkey  sources  of  risk  are  being  managed;  and  to  help  prioritize  policy  responses.  Detailed \nassessments of relevant financial sector standards and codes are also being undertaken.  \n \n12.  Support  development  of  a  comprehensive  compliance  framework  for  capital \nmarkets to enhance investor protection. As early as 1998, IOSCO required implementation \nof an effective compliance program as one of the 30 principles of securities regulation. Likewise, \nthe  Bank  for  International  Settlement  developed  a  set  of  principles  to  govern  compliance \nrequirements  for  banking  institutions.  It  helps  promote  a  business  culture  that  values  and \npromotes not only compliance in form but also in substance, coupled with a high ethical and \ninvestor protection standard. This is viewed as a building block to good governance. Support is \nrequired  for  Bapepam-LK  to  develop  a  comprehensive  compliance  framework  for  capital \nmarkets  and  help  IDX  develop  detailed  rules  on  compliance  functions  for  stock-brokering \ncompanies.  \n \n13.  Support the introduction of new products, such as mortgage credit insurance and \nother risk management products. With the need to increase the supply of liquid and highly \nrated assets as a major priority, new products must be introduced. Recently introduced financial \nproducts include (i) exchange-traded funds, (ii) asset-backed securities (iii) single-stock futures, \nand (iv) stock lending and borrowing. Introduction of risk management products by Bapepam-LK \n ", "4 \nsuch as interest rate and bond futures, as well as mortgage credit insurance would need \nsupport. Bapapem-LK wishes to develop an efficient mortgage insurance system to protect \nlenders and investors against loss by reason of borrower default in situations where the home \nvalue (net of foreclosure-related costs) is insufficient to fully repay the mortgage obligation. \nFinancial institutions usually grant housing loans based solely on collateral of borrowers, within \nthe loan-to-value limit of each bank. Mortgage credit insurance will facilitate the development of \nthe housing finance industry and enhance credit for housing.  \n \n14.  Strengthen and consolidate the insurance industry. Historically, capital requirements \nfor insurance companies have been lax and licensing requirements loose. The industry was \nsheltered from international competition, and state involvement was significant. The Indonesian \ninsurance industry is small, but highly fragmented with 51 life insurance companies, 97 general \ninsurance companies, and 4 reinsurance companies. The industry is heavily concentrated, with \nthe top 5 general insurance companies accounting for 51% of general insurance assets and the \ntop 5 life insurance companies accounting for 55% of life insurance assets. Bapepam-LK issued \nrules  in  2008  requiring  minimum  equity  for  insurance  companies  to  be  increased  from  \nRp40 billion to Rp100 billion and for reinsurance companies from Rp100 billion to Rp200 billion \nover a transition period from 2010 to 2014.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the TA will be greater financial sector diversification and resilience. The \noutcome will be increased contribution by the capital market to domestic financing.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA, associated with the CMDPC, will address immediate and short-term capacity-\nbuilding needs and complement the change management assistance provided by Australian \nAgency for International Development. The TA will support development of a deeper and more \nresilient  capital  market  and  enhanced  supervision  with  improved  regulatory  resources  and \ncapacity. Key areas of focus under the TA include support for:  \n \n(i)  curricula for training programs and standards for certification for professionals in \ncapital market-related fields; \n(ii)  strengthened capacity of Bapepam-LK; \n(iii)  recommendations  and  implementation  of  key  reforms  and  regulations  in  the \nfinancial sector; and \n(iv)  technical  advice  for  the  development  of  new  capital  market  products, \nstrengthened market supervision, and regulatory capacity with ultimate aims to \nimprove overall governance standards of capital markets and investor protection.  \n \n17.  Key outputs and related activities include: (i) implementation of the capital market master \nplan (2010\u20132014); (ii) benchmarking of a regulatory framework for harmonizing standards and \nregional  cooperation;  (iii)  strengthening  of  Bapepam-LK's  investigative  and  enforcement \ncapacity;  (iv)  regulatory  reforms  that  are  likely  to  be  required  following  reviews  under  the \nFinancial  Sector  Assessment  Program;  (v)  development  and  establishment  of  an  investor \nprotection fund for the securities market; (vi) development of a structured and comprehensive \nhuman resource capacity program for Bapepam-LK; (vii) development of a comprehensive \ncapital markets database and website for public information services and the promotion of \n ", "         5 \nmarket  transparency;  (viii)  establishment  of  a  capital  markets  institute  for  capital  markets;  \n(ix) development of a comprehensive compliance framework for capital markets to enhance \ninvestor protection; (x) introduction of new products, such as mortgage credit insurance; and  \n(xi) strengthening and consolidation of the insurance Industry. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,900,000  equivalent,  of  which  ADB  will  provide \n$1,500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF\u2014other sources). The government will provide the remaining $400,000 \nequivalent by providing counterpart staff and other support facilities. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Bapepam-LK  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  It  will  provide  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, and other services to the consultants. It will closely coordinate with other \nstakeholders involved in TA implementation. A capital markets capacity-building committee \ncomprising representatives from Bapepam-LK will be established to provide guidance on the \nallocation and use of training-related funds under the TA. The TA is expected to commence in \nMarch 2010 and be completed by December 2011.  \n \n20.  A  combination  of  consulting  firms  and  individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), based on requirements to be identified during CMDPC implementation and the follow-up \npolicy measures under the post-program monitoring framework. The activities (para. 17) will not \nbe undertaken simultaneously, rather their implementation will depend on the pace of reforms \nundertaken over the next 2 years. The TA proposes a degree of flexibility in the methodology of \nconsultant engagement, either through a firm or individuals. For implementation of the master \nplan,  a  minimum  of  10  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  6  person-months  of \nnational consulting will be engaged through a firm selected using quality-based selection. This \nmethod  is  used  as  the  assignments  entail  recommending  and  drafting  key  reforms  and \nregulations in the financial sector; inadequacies will result in high costs for both the sector and \nthe economy. Short-listed firms will submit simplified technical proposals. The TA will include  \n36.5 person-months of international consulting and 20 months of national consulting focusing on \ntechnical advice concerning the development of new capital market products, enhancement of \nmarket supervision, and improvement of regulatory resources and capacity. The ultimate aims \nare to improve the overall governance standards for capital markets and accord greater investor \nprotection.  All  consultants  will  submit  an  inception  report  detailing  a  draft  work  plan  and \nschedule within 1 week of fielding, and provide concise regular updates to Bapepam-LK and \nADB outlining progress and identifying implementation issues. Where appropriate, midterm, \ndraft final, and final reports will be required to be submitted according to a schedule agreed to \nwith Bapepam-LK and ADB. All services, equipment, and material to support implementation of \nthe TA will be procured by direct purchase in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Equipment will include computer hardware and software \nrelated to development and management of the capital markets database and website and \ncoordination requirements among the concerned regulatory agencies. All equipment procured \nunder the TA will be handed over to concerned counterpart agencies upon TA completion. \n ", "6 \nBapepam-LK will disseminate relevant TA outputs though its website. Disbursements under the \nTA will be made in accordance with the ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.5  \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for Strengthening Indonesia's Capital Market, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.  \n \n  \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2008.
