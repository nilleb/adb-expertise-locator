INTRODUCTION \n1.  Based on the successful outcome of small-scale water resources (SSWR) development \nsector projects (SSWRDSP) phase I1 and ongoing phase II,2 the follow-on Participatory Small-\nScale Water Resources Project (PSSWRP) is included in the country strategy and program3 for \nBangladesh. ADB fielded a Fact-Finding Mission for formulating the project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA)4 in October 2007. The Mission held meetings with representatives of the \nGovernment, external funding agencies, and beneficiaries to reach preliminary agreements on \ntechnical assistance (TA) objectives, scope, cost, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The PSSWRP will institutionalize and internalize the stakeholder-driven approach for \nsustainable small-scale (less than 1,000 hectares [ha]) water resources management while giving \nparticular attention to poorer sections of the population. The TA design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Poverty and Rural Livelihoods. Bangladesh has a total area of about 14.7 million ha \nand net cultivable area of about 8 million ha. Despite considerable progress, Bangladesh remains \none of the world\u2019s poorest nations, with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $447, poverty \nincidence of 50%, and a child malnutrition rate of 48%. Over 80% of the population is rural, of \nwhich two thirds are landless or near landless.5 Those with productive land are subject to regular \nflooding.6  Although  agriculture\u2019s  share  of  GDP  (currently  19%)  has  been  declining  as  the \neconomy grows, it remains the primary economic sector in rural Bangladesh and provides 63% of \nemployment.  The  rural  poor  in  Bangladesh  face  unfavorable  agricultural  environments,  rely \nheavily on  agricultural wage labor, and possess few agricultural and nonagricultural assets. \nAccelerating agricultural and rural growth is central to reducing poverty, as noted in Bangladesh\u2019s \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy, which specifically prioritizes accelerated rural growth and \ndevelopment of agricultural and nonfarm economic activities.  \n3.  Key challenges in water management include flooding, river erosion, water shortages, and \nenvironmental  degradation.  These  are  aggravated  by  inadequate  water  management \ninfrastructure,  limited  beneficiary  participation,  and  weak  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nfunding.  Increasing  urbanization  and  expansion  of  fish  production  on  agricultural  land  (as \nculturable wasteland is utilized) is forecast to result in absolute decline of agricultural land by 1.64 \nmillion ha by 2050. Yields will need to increase annually by 20% to compensate for the loss of \nagricultural land. Effective water management and equitable access to water are critical for the \nproduction base and livelihoods of the rural poor. \n4.  Policy Framework. The Government has made efforts to create an enabling environment \nfor improving water resources management over the past decade through a range of water sector \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project. Manila (Loan \n1381-BAN), for $32.0 million, approved on 26 September 1995 and implemented from 1996 to 2002, developed 280 \nsubprojects in the western part of the country.  \n2  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project. Manila \n(Loan 1831-BAN), for $34.0 million, approved on 12 July 2001 and to be implemented between 2002 and 2009, will \ndevelop 275 subprojects in 61 of 64 districts. \n3  ADB. 2005. Bangladesh: Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010). Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 September 2007. \n5  For 97 subprojects implemented under SSWRDSP phase II, about 85% of beneficiary households have landholdings \nof less than 1 hectare and of these, about 50% are landless or near landless (landholding < 0.2 hectare). \n6  On average, 20% of the country experiences monsoon floods. The Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock estimates that \nthe 2007 floods inundated 30\u201342% of Bangladesh, affecting 14 million people with 1 million tons lost rice production. \n ", "2   \nreforms. The 1999 National Water Policy adopts the principles of sustainable service delivery \nthrough stakeholder participation, decentralization, and integrated water resources management \n(IWRM).  The  policy  provides  a  comprehensive  framework  for  participatory  IWRM,  strategic \nplanning,  sustainable  O&M,  and  progressive  transfer  to  local  water  management  groups. \nGuidelines for Participatory Water Management7 (2001) focus on the requirement for consultative \nand participative approaches in sector development interventions. These reforms provide the \nessential basis to comprehensively address the country\u2019s water sector problems through effective \nIWRM and sustainable service delivery.  \n5.  Lessons. Over the past decade, ADB investments in SSWRDSP phases I and II have \ndemonstrably strengthened the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), which is the \nExecuting Agency for these projects, through organizational reform and capacity building. On \neach  subproject,  the  formation  of  legal  entities,  known  as,  Water  Management  Cooperative \nAssociations  (WMCAs),  which  are  fully  inclusive,  community-based  water  management \norganizations, has driven efforts to maximize stakeholder participation in planning, design, and \nO&M  of  water  management  that  includes  facilities  for  flood  management,  drainage,  water \nconservation, and command area development. The WMCAs have facilitated microcredit facilities, \ninput  supply,  dissemination  of  improved  technology,  and,  in  many  cases,  organization  of \nvoluntary labor for productive or social purposes.  \n6.  Enhancing  rural  incomes  through  decentralized,  community  managed,  small-scale \nsystems has proven to be an effective means for reducing rural poverty.8  The  experiences  of \nSSWRDSP phases I and II indicate that (i) increasing productivity and sustainability of WMCAs \nrequires  continued  provision  of  support  services,  improved  interagency  coordination,  and \nstrengthened monitoring and evaluation processes to better identify and respond to evolving \nneeds;  (ii)  participatory  development  with  full  beneficiary  engagement  at  critical  stages \n(identification, planning, execution, and O&M) has direct implications for the sustainability of \nWMCAs; and (iii) providing continued support to the IWRM Unit (IWRMU), established within \nLGED  under  SSWRDSP  phase  II,  through  internalizing  and  institutionalizing  the  subproject \ndevelopment process is pivotal for ensuring the WMCAs\u2019 overall sustainability. Project-specific \nissues are presented in Appendix 2.  \n7.  ADB Support. The present TA and ensuing loan project will support the country strategy \nand program and the Government\u2019s pro-poor economic growth strategy by helping the rural poor \nboost productivity, diversify production, and stimulate off-farm activity by (i) expanding access to \nirrigation and associated flood protection through command area and small-scale water resource \nmanagement;  (ii)  strengthening  farm-to-market  linkages;  and  (iii)  improving  the  enabling \nenvironment  for  agribusiness,  with  particular  emphasis  on  initiatives  by  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups. \n8.  Past experiences and lessons learned (from SSWRDSP phases I and II) will contribute to \nrefining  the  participatory  subproject  development  process  and  enhancing  sustainability  in \nagricultural and fisheries production through well-functioning WMCAs. Congruently, there will be \na requirement for further strengthening the IWRMU to catalyze its evolution as a sector champion \ncapable of providing continued support to beneficiary communities. These actions further support \n                                                 \n7  Formulated jointly by the Ministry of Water Resources and Ministry of Local Government Division. \n8  Local Government Engineering Department of the Government of People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. 2003.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA\u2019s impact is enhanced effectiveness and increased sustainability in agricultural and \nfisheries production along with poverty reduction through SSWR development. The TA\u2019s outcome \nis the design of a project that will tentatively comprise (i) institutional strengthening of LGED\u2019s \nIWRMU in planning, design, operation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation functions \nin  order  to  internalize  and  institutionalize  the  SSWR  development  process;  (ii)  beneficiary \nparticipation  and  WMCA  strengthening  through  further  refinement  of  critical  aspects  of  the \nparticipatory project process and value addition to performing WMCAs through structural and \nnonstructural  interventions;  and  (iii)  development  of  small-scale  water  management  systems \n(implementing  subprojects  with  appropriate  agricultural  extension  and  fisheries  development \nactivities, as well as environmental monitoring). \n10.  TA outputs will comprise (i) recommendations for further strengthening the institutional \nframework supporting SSWR development, putting particular emphasis on LGED\u2019s IWRMU and \nproject management office, with a time-bound action plan, and activities and services provided by \npartner  government  agencies;  (ii)  performance  and  sustainability  aspects  of  WMCAs  and \nrecommendations for refining and optimizing the participatory project development process to \nenhance sustainability; (iii) terms of reference and resource requirements for a comprehensive \nstudy  of  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts;10  (iv)  fully  appraised  sample  subprojects  meeting  ADB \nrequirements  to  illustrate  the  technical,  social,  environmental,  and  economic  feasibility  and \nimpacts of the proposed project; and (v) an investment program including objectives, scope, cost \nand financing plan, procurement plan, and institutional arrangements to facilitate timely, proactive, \nand effective planning and implementation of small-scale subprojects. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will (i) use IWRMU and LGED\u2019s existing institutional and technical capacities; (ii) \nexplore alternative options for institutional strengthening of IWRMU, WMCAs, and other partner \nline  agencies;  (iii)  refine  the  participatory  project  development  process;  and  (iv)  support \ncomprehensive subproject planning and related studies, incorporating lessons and experiences \nfrom  earlier  phases  of  the  broader  project.  A  consultative  approach  will  be  taken  through \nstakeholder workshops and direct consultation with beneficiary communities. Three activities are \ndefined, as described below. \n12.   Activity 1: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building. The TA will identify areas \nfor  further  strengthening  of  the  institutional  framework  supporting  SSWR  development,  with \nparticular emphasis on strengthening LGED\u2019s IWRMU and project management office, as well as \nactivities  and  services  provided  by  partner  government  agencies.  This  will  be  particularly \nimportant following commencement in 2008 of Japan Bank for International Cooperation\u2019s (JBIC) \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development Project.11 LGED\u2019s IWRMU will be responsible for \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2003. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila (the original policy paper, of \nwhich this is a typeset copy, was approved in 2001). \n10 Proposed nationwide coverage of the project would include the Chittagong Hill Tracts, which are dominated by tribal \npeoples and Bengali settlers. Recognizing the risks of working in a politically and socially sensitive region, the \nensuing loan-financed project will undertake a comprehensive social feasibility study. Based on its outcome, the \nproject may then consider undertaking pilot subprojects towards the latter part of project implementation. \n11 To develop 200 subprojects in Greater Faridpur, Greater Mymensingh, and Greater Sylhet (covering 15 districts). \nThe map shows the project areas of SSWRDSP phases I and II and the JBIC project.  \n ", "4   \nplanning,  design,  O&M,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  harmonize  the  participatory \ndevelopment process. SSWRDSPs are demand driven, thereby preventing duplication of efforts \non any single subproject.  \n13.  The TA will (i) highlight weaknesses in IWRMU functionality and composition, prepare an \norganizational chart and terms of reference for staff, and prepare a time-bound action plan for \nstrengthening and fully institutionalizing IWRMU; (ii) assess the potential number of subprojects \nto  be  undertaken  and  also  make  recommendations  for  coverage  in  those  areas  under  the \nJBIC-financed project; and (iii) identify options for forging linkages with allied sector support \nservices while reviewing and ascertaining requirements for functionalizing existing coordination \nagreements with partner line agencies.     \n14.   Activity 2: Participatory Subproject Development. The TA will propose requirements \nfor  refining  subproject  selection  criteria  and  the  participatory  development  process\u2014from \nsubproject identification to O&M\u2014to further improve participation, sustainability of investments, \nenhanced productivity of agriculture and fisheries, and overall poverty reduction impacts. The TA \nwill identify weaknesses in the current procedures with specific focus on subproject identification \nand participatory rural appraisal.12\n15.  The TA will recommend options to harmonize the process for feasibility studies, quality \nenhancement, and greater inclusiveness (especially for vulnerable and poor groups). Subproject \nearthwork  activities  are  to  be  undertaken  entirely  by  labor  contracting  societies  comprising \nvulnerable  persons  (specifically  the  landless,  fisherfolk,  and  women)  from  the  subproject \nbeneficiary  community.  The  TA  will  analyze  the  performance  of  these  societies  and  make \nrecommendations for improving contracting services to avoid capture of benefits by local elites, \nachieve  quality  outputs,  and  create  an  enabling  environment  to  improve  employment \nopportunities for the vulnerable and poor. \n16.  Activity  3:  Subproject  Proposals.  The  TA  will  formulate  a  sector  project  through \nsubproject feasibility studies; institutional, social, and environmental analyses; and investment \nprogramming  and  project  packaging.  Specific  activities  will  include  (i)  finalizing  participatory \noptions and detailed feasibility studies of sample subprojects; (ii) assessing safeguards and \npreparing the requisite action plans; (iii) formulating a social development strategy and action \nprograms, including specific studies13 and a gender action plan; (iv) undertaking consultations for \nstrengthening IWRM and sustaining O&M; and (v) formulating an investment package ready for \nimplementation. An initial poverty and social analysis is provided in Appendix 2.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $700,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the cost, equivalent to $100,000, through the provision of administrative support, \ncounterpart  staffing  and  their  operating  costs,  studies,  surveys,  data  analysis,  and  reports \n(detailed in Appendix 3). The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n                                                 \n12 This activity will be undertaken through engaging nongovernment organizations to assess the broad support for a \nproposed subproject, likely environmental impacts and mitigation measures, willingness of beneficiaries to form \nWMCAs, etc. \n13 For example, to analyze ADB-financed activities within the SSWR sector and overall impacts in the social and \npoverty context. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a 5-month period, commencing in February 2008 and to \nbe completed in July 2008. LGED will be the Executing Agency and will appoint a project director \nat the level of senior engineer and under the guidance of the Additional Chief Engineer (Planning) \nof LGED and the Ministry of Local Government Division in coordination with other concerned line \nagencies. LGED will form a TA steering committee to be chaired by the Chief Engineer, mobilize \ncounterpart staff, and provide available background data and information. Providing liaison and \ncoordination with all concerned government agencies at the national and district level will also be \nLGED\u2019s  regular  responsibility.  ADB  will  provide  intensive  review  and  supervision  by  fielding \nmissions at critical stages of TA implementation. \n19.  The TA consultants will be recruited through single source selection of the consulting firm \n(Northwest Hydraulic Consultants, Canada) responsible for implementing SSWRDSP phases I \nand II in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (February 2007, as \namended from time to time). The firm has unique experience for the assignment, having been for \nmore than a decade engaged in the SSWR sector in Bangladesh. It has contributed to successful \nimplementation  of  SSWRDSP  phase  I,  as  highlighted  by  the  preliminary  findings  of  the \nOperations Evaluation Department\u2019s Evaluation Mission14 and by satisfactory performance during \nSSWRDSP phase II. Single source selection will therefore have the advantage of utilizing a firm \nwith  unique  knowledge  of  sector  issues,  practical  experience  in  addressing  design  and \nimplementation weaknesses, and suitability to apply this knowledge in enhancing and refining \nproject design.  \n20.  The consulting firm will submit a biodata technical proposal and a financial proposal for \nreview to ensure adequacy and enable subsequent contract negotiations. The TA requires (i) 13 \nperson-months of international consulting services comprising specialists in institutions (team \nleader),  participatory  development,  water  resources  operation  and  management,  social \nsafeguards, and natural resource economics; and (ii) 18 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices comprising specialists in water resources management, social and poverty development, \ngender,  resettlement,  environment,  institutional  development,  agricultural  and  fisheries \neconomics, and financial management. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. Equipment \nwill be procured by the consultants following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (February 2007, as \namended from time to time) and turned over to the Government following completion of the TA.  \n 21.   TA consultants will submit an inception report after 1 month, interim report after 2-1/2 \nmonths, and draft final report at the end of the fourth month following TA commencement. The \nfinal report will be submitted at the end of the fifth month, following incorporation of all comments \nreceived. Stakeholder workshops involving LGED, the Government, the consultants, and ADB will \nbe  organized  to  discuss  these  reports.  Tripartite  meetings  attended  by  LGED  and  relevant \ngovernment representatives, ADB, and the consultants will be held shortly after receipt of the \ninterim and draft final reports.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Bangladesh for preparing the Participatory Small-Scale Water Resource\u2019s Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2007.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and sector analysis describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nBangladesh is characterized by an extensive network of rivers draining around 113 million hectare meters of water \nto the Bay of Bengal, 90% of which flows from the upper catchments outside the country. The flat topography, high \nintensity rainfall and, inadequate capacity of rivers cause drainage congestion, inundation, and flooding during \nmonsoon. The Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers and their tributaries dominate the economic and social life of the \ncountry. Bangladesh has twin problems of flooding during monsoon and shortage of water during dry season that \ncauses droughts severely impacting agriculture, fisheries, and livelihoods in the affected areas. The poor people of \nthe rural areas suffer the most. Agriculture, as the primary economic sector in rural Bangladesh, provides 63% of \nemployment opportunities in the rural areas. The main employment window for the rural poor is as seasonal labor \nin the agriculture sector. The productivity is low, and often crops and fisheries are lost due to flooding or drought. \nIn many areas, only one crop is cultivated due to waterlogging or lack of irrigation opportunities during the dry \nseason. The uncertainties and vulnerabilities of heavy rain, flooding, and lack of irrigation water negatively affect \nagricultural productivity.  \n \nAccording to the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, about 40% of the population of Bangladesh \nlives below the poverty line. In the rural areas, 43.8% of the population falls into this category. There are specific \npoverty pockets where absolute poverty is higher than the rural average. The country faces recurrent natural \ndisasters, including cyclones, floods, droughts, and river erosion, causing severe damage to assets and the lives \nof the people. Disaster-induced rural-urban migration in search of livelihoods has increased, causing pressures on \nurban areas. The rapid population growth rate of 1.5% annually contributes to increasing landlessness and \nconsequent poverty. According to a study by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies in 2004, the \nestimate of chronic poverty at the national level based on the Human Poverty Index was 35.5%. Twenty-eight out \nof  the  country\u2019s  64  districts  suffer  from  chronic  poverty  above  the  national  average.  Since  the  poor  are \nconcentrated in rural areas, enhancing agriculture and rural development has been identified in the Government\u2019s \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy as a key sector for pro-poor economic growth. This is very much dependent \non efficient water resources management.  \n \nEffective water resources management is a major issue for sustainable economic growth and environmental \nprotection. Management of floods and ensuring steady water supply for irrigation during the dry season are critical \nfor rural economic growth and for poverty reduction. Water has to be managed in a strategic, integrated, and \nparticipatory manner that includes mobilizing, organizing, and empowering stakeholders. The National Poverty \nReduction Strategy identified water resources development and management as a critical sector for pro-poor \neconomic growth through agricultural development. The National Water Management Policy and National Water \nManagement Plan underscore water resource development and institutional capacity development at the local \nlevels. The Government has already taken legal and regulatory measures to promote stakeholder participation at \nthe local level, together with national institutional development for water management.  \n  \nThe project will improve productivity in the agricultural and fisheries sectors through effective, participatory, and \nsustainable small-scale water management. A sector approach will be adopted to identify subprojects in a \nparticipatory manner. Flood control, drainage, water retention, and command area development activities will be \nundertaken  based  on  feasibility  studies.  Sustainable  development  and  maintenance  of  water  management \ninfrastructure will increase agricultural and fisheries coverage and productivity. Water Management Cooperative \nAssociations (WMCAs) will be formed in each subproject area by the beneficiaries and about one third of the \nmembers of WMCAs will be women. The WMCAs will eventually be responsible for operation and maintenance of \nthe infrastructure for sustainability of project benefits. The WMCAs will provide a collective forum for various \nbeneficiaries, thereby ensuring participation in decision making and in subproject benefits\u2014and especially for the \npoor and vulnerable\u2014in a planned manner. The Executing Agency will provide support in establishing WMCAs, \ntraining the members, and linking the WMCAs with various service-providing agencies to facilitate members\u2019 \naccess to various services. The WMCAs will also be oriented toward, and trained in, operating and maintaining the \ninfrastructure through an ongoing process during subproject development.  \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention;   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \nM2, etc.) \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The project initially will cover 61 districts of the country and \nwill  undertake  a  comprehensive  study  to  highlight  key  issues  and  assess  the  viability  of  possible  future \ninterventions in the three districts that comprise the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The project will implement subprojects \nto improve water resources management in the project area. The project will benefit the people by increasing \nproductivity in agriculture and fisheries. All categories of farmers in the catchments areas will benefit from reduced \nwaterlogging, improved drainage and flood management, and increased irrigation opportunities. The poor and \nvulnerable women and men will benefit from direct employment opportunities created in construction activities and \nfrom the additional employment opportunities created in the agriculture and fisheries sectors.  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? Not \napplicable. \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence?  The PPTA project has allocated resources to hire the \nservices of a Participatory Development Specialist, Social and Poverty Specialist and Gender Specialist who will \nfurther refine the pro-poor design features based on appropriate analysis of the socioeconomic context of the \ncountry. \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-\npoor governance, and pro-poor growth)? The project will directly benefit the poor by creating employment \nopportunities in construction activities through labor contracting societies and for the contractors. All earthworks \nwill be done through these societies specifically formed from the landless and absolute poor. Moreover, they will \nbenefit as agricultural laborers due to creation of additional employment opportunities in the agricultural and \nfisheries sector as a result of increased coverage and additional cropping. The WMCAs will include at least 40% of \ntheir members from amongst the poor and landless. Each of the WMCAs will develop a poverty reduction action \nplan identifying and implementing activities that will include skills training and microfinance operations and will \ncontribute towards reducing poverty. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1. Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? Initially, the project will improve agricultural and fisheries production through participatory and \nsustainable small-scale water resource management. That will benefit entire communities under the subprojects. \nFarmers (large, small, medium, and marginal) will benefit from higher productivity and increased agricultural \ncoverage as a result of reduced waterlogging and flooding as well as increased irrigation opportunities. Fisheries \nproduction will increase due to development of water control and management structures. Poor men and women \nwill benefit from direct employment opportunities and skills transfer created under the project for construction \n(earthworks)  of  water  management  infrastructure.  Moreover,  they  will  benefit  from  increased  employment \nopportunities in the agricultural and fisheries sectors. They will also benefit from membership in WMCAs, as these \nwill provide various productive skills and microfinance facilities. Each WMCA will prepare and implement a poverty \nreduction plan. An empowerment process will begin due to people\u2019s participation in the WMCAs\u2019 decision-making \nprocesses.  \n   \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? Subproject beneficiaries suffer \nfrom waterlogging, flooding, drought, and lack of irrigation opportunities. Cropping intensity is low, and crops are \noften damaged. The beneficiaries need opportunities to make the best use of their land and other assets free from \nflooding and drought. Flood management, water conservation, drainage, and command area development are the \npotential needs of the people. In addition, the landless people of the area need employment opportunities, access \nto capital, and productive skills for livelihood support. \n    \n3. What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? Subproject beneficiaries are unable to (entirely) finance water management infrastructure. The \nproject will construct water management infrastructure for drainage, flood control, command area development, \nwater conservation, and improved irrigation facilities. The Executing Agency\u2019s capacity to manage participatory \nprocesses is limited. The beneficiaries, too, are not oriented to the participatory processes and improved water \nmanagement. The landless and poor groups are often ignored by the service-providing agencies. The project will \nsupport organizing inclusive WMCAs, where beneficiary groups can participate and access benefits from project \nactivities.  Linkages  will  be  strengthened  with  service-providing  departments  in  allied  sectors  so  that  the \nbeneficiaries can access resources, training, and capital. Technical assistance will be given to strengthen the \ncapacity of the Executing Agency in facilitating and managing participatory processes in small-scale water \nresources management.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n\u2022  The initial stakeholders are within the Government of Bangladesh. The Ministry of Finance; Ministry of \nPlanning; and Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives will be involved. The \nExecuting Agency will be the Local Government Engineering Department. The Department of Cooperatives will \nbe involved in registering WMCAs and supervising their management.   \n\u2022  At the subproject level, the stakeholders include landowners; large, small, and marginal farmers; landless \npeople;  and  the  union  council.  Subproject  men  and  women  are  stakeholders,  as  are  locally  based \nnongovernment organizations which will also be involved in various project activities. Various service-providing \nagencies of the Government (Department of Agriculture Extension, Department of Fisheries, and Department of \nCooperatives)  will  be  involved  in  providing  extension  support  services  to  the  WMCAs  and  subproject \nbeneficiaries.  \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA)  or  project  processing  (e.g.,  workshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment \norganizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? Various types of consultation and participation will be \nrequired at differing levels. Community mobilization activities will be undertaken during the PPTA at the sample \nsubproject level. Consultation and workshops will be required for social, gender, and environmental assessments \nand for developing action plans and strategies. The PPTA will review the existing participation methods in the \nsmall-scale water development sector and suggest ways for effective community mobilization to be followed during \nthe implementation phase. In addition to the inception and draft final report workshops, more community-based \nworkshops will be undertaken to ascertain, inter alia, factors influencing WMCA performance, strengthening \nparticipatory  subproject  development  processes,  and  enhancing  linkages  with  associated  government  line \ndepartments to improve provision of support services. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nDirect involvement of the local people in water management has been found to be effective and useful. Community \nparticipation in water management is an approach emphasized by the National Water Management Plan (1999). \nThe Guidelines for Participatory Water Management (2002) provide a framework that ensures participation of all \nstakeholders, including the beneficiaries and the local government agencies.  \n \nThe technical assistance (TA) will examine the lessons from the ongoing operational aspects of WMCAs under the \nSecond Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project, which promotes the establishment of a \ncommunity-oriented institutional framework for water management (involving both structural and nonstructural \ninterventions). An effective, practical, and inclusive participation strategy will be developed for the project based on \nthe findings and considering the needs and interests of diverse groups within the population, including landholders, \nmarginal and small farmers, the landless, fisherfolk, and other associated stakeholders. Means to strengthen the \nlinkages and cooperation with the service-providing agencies and the union council will be pursued to ensure that \nthe benefits from the project interventions are maximized. The TA will also look into how local government \ninstitutions can become more supportive of WMCAs.  \n \nThe TA will identify ways to ensure greater participation of various stakeholder groups, including the users and \nbeneficiaries, in regular operation and maintenance of the subprojects, livelihood support activities, and WMCA \ndecision making. Stakeholder roles in maintaining the water management infrastructure will also be assessed and \nthe PPTA will identify ways to improve it. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n\u2022  Water management and infrastructure are considered primarily to be in the men\u2019s domain, and the participation \nof and benefits for women from this sector are not yet well understood. \n\u2022  There are limited numbers of women who are agricultural landowners. Even though they are involved in \nagricultural and fisheries activities, the benefit of their participation is not considered important or quantified. \n\u2022  Female-headed households and women from landless families are the poorest, and the importance of water \nmanagement as a facilitating factor for their livelihoods is not understood. They have little access to social \nprotection and livelihood support measures. \n\u2022  Women bear the burden of poverty in the family, and they are the ones most adversely affected during floods \nand other natural disasters. They require support for coping with these events. \n \n2.  Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?        Yes          No    Please explain.  \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \nThe project has high potential to promote women\u2019s empowerment by involving them in WMCA decision making \n(through their inclusion in the management committees) and by facilitating their access to employment, skills, \nmicrofinance, and other such resources. The TA will assess the models used for integrating gender aspects into \nthe  ongoing  water  management  initiatives  and  develop  a  plan  to  maximize  the  impact  of  structural  and \nnonstructural measures for water management in promoting women\u2019s participation and gender equality. Both \nwomen and men will benefit from a more secure environment, and particularly from improved flood management. \nWomen play a significant role in the household economy. As the project will benefit the agricultural landholders, it \nwill specifically target women as beneficiaries through specific components and initiatives. Women\u2019s participation \nwill be ensured throughout the cycle of each subproject. Based on experience from the ongoing Second Small-\nScale Water Resources Development Sector Project, the TA will suggest means to increase women\u2019s share in the \nlabor opportunities arising from the project. It will also suggest ways to boost employment and income-earning \nopportunities in the production sector that will benefit from the project. A realistic gender action plan with adequate \nresource provisions will be prepared during the PPTA. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?       \n          Yes          No    Please explain  \n \nThe loan project will promote women\u2019s empowerment by involving them in WMCA decision making and facilitating \ntheir access to employment, skills, microfinance, and the like. Both women and men will benefit from a more \nsecure environment, and particularly due to flood prevention. The PPTA will suggest means to specifically target \nwomen as beneficiaries through particular components and initiatives throughout the cycle of each subproject. It \nwill suggest ways to increase women\u2019s labor opportunities in the project and their employment and income-earning \nopportunities in those production sectors benefiting from the project. A gender action plan will be prepared during \nthe PPTA. \nIII.
