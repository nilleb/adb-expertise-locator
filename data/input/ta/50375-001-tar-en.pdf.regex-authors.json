INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \nachievement  of  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  by  assisting  selected  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) with creating strategic financing plans for social protection. The \nfinancing plans will expand the coverage of social protection, help build the capacity of national \nagencies working on social protection, and support the generation of reliable data for monitoring, \nevaluating, and reporting to aid planning.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Management-approved 2017 \nannual work program of the Social Development Thematic Group.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The SDGs emphasize the importance of social protection investments to ensure that no \none is left behind in the fight against poverty. Social protection has a prominent place as an \ninstrument for poverty reduction strategies and is one of the key pillars of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 \nOut of the 17 SDGs and 169 targets, 11 goals and 28 targets can be related to social protection.4 \nAchieving the goals and reaching the social protection agenda of the SDGs require concrete \npolicy changes. In turn, substantial social protection policy changes generally need concrete \nbudgetary investments, which require the mobilization of new or the reallocation of existing \nfinancial resources. \n \n4.  DMCs have recognized social protection as one of the key priorities for achieving growth \nwith equity. At the country level,  several governments have already started designing  and \nreforming their social protection systems. However, the coverage provided by social insurance \nvery often remains limited to formal employment; hence, innovative measures to tackle the need \nto cover or protect vulnerable populations are still needed. One of the key challenges of expanding \nsocial protection in DMCs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, is adequate financing. \nFinancing  social  protection  programs  remains  a  major  challenge  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  Recent \nexpenditure data of the ADB Social Protection Indicator have shown that DMCs spent on average \nless than 3.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) for social protection programs, which include \ncontributory and noncontributory social protection and active labor market programs.5 Initial \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 May 2017. \n2  ADB. 2017. Social Development Thematic Group. Workplan 2017. Unpublished. \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008-2020. Manila; \nADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific (R-Paper). \nManila. \n4  The 11 SDGs that can be related to social protection are: Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere; Goal 2. \nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture; Goal 3. Ensure \nhealthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages; Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and \npromote lifelong learning opportunities for all; Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls; \nGoal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all; Goal 7. Ensure access to \naffordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable \neconomic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and \namong countries; Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; Goal 13. \nTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Specific targets under these goals link to the four major \ncategories of a social protection system: social cash transfers, health care, education, and other essential services. \nFor Goal 11, for example, target 11.1 (ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic \nservices and upgrade slums) forms part of \u201cother essential services.\u201d   \n5  Recalculated based on Table 2.1 of ADB. 2016. The Social Protection Indicator: Assessing Results for Asia. Manila \n(an output of ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Assessing and Monitoring Social Protection Programs in Asia and \nthe Pacific. Manila). \n ", "2 \nestimates in a study on financing social protection supported by ADB also reveal huge financing \ngaps that will make it difficult to meet the SDGs in Asia.6 To meet social protection floors, DMCs \nmust increase their budget requirement on an average of 5% GDP for low-income countries and \nabout 2% GDP for middle-income countries.  \n \n5.  As highlighted in the same preliminary study on financing social protection, most of the \ncountries studied can mobilize resources to meet lower estimates of the fiscal revenues needed \nto finance the social protection agenda of the SDGs. Tax revenues are important sources of \nfinancing for social protection. DMCs also need to look at other alternatives, such as spending \nreallocation, prioritization, and optimization. Some countries may seek to create fiscal space to \nfinance social protection by optimizing or reallocating resources from low-priority sectors to cover \nthe gap that could potentially expand social protection coverage. \n \n6.  Financing constraints in DMCs are compounded by the low quality of demonstrated \ncapacity to design and implement social protection programs. Three factors contribute to lack of \ncapacity to design and implement social protection programs: (i) lack of financial analyses of the \ncurrent social protection programs, (ii) lack of strategic frameworks to finance sustainable social \nprotection  programs,  and  (iii)  lack  of  training  programs  on  planning  and  monitoring  public \nspending on social protection programs. These are the key areas that the TA intends to address \nas reflected in the expected outputs and outcome. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: investments on social protection programs in \nDMCs to achieve SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10 increased. The TA will have the following outcome: \ncapacity to assess and access financing options to expand social protection programs in DMC \nministries working on social protection increased.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  Output 1: Financial analyses of the current social protection programs in three \nselected DMCs prepared.8 A comprehensive financial assessment of expenditure on priority \nsocial protection programs related to SDG targets will be conducted in three selected DMCs:  \nIndonesia, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste. National consultants will be hired to collect the information \nfrom relevant government agencies. Information collected will be assessed and validated by \n                                                \n6  ADB. Preliminary Study on Financing Social Protection for Sustainable Development Goals in Asia. Unpublished. \nThe study was funded by ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for Delivering Knowledge Solutions in Asia and the \nPacific. Manila. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n8  ADB\u2019s preliminary study on financing social protection in 16 countries in Asia recommended that in-depth studies \nshould be conducted in a number of countries that will face considerable challenges to meet the requirement of social \nprotection targets of SDGs. Preliminary discussions with ADB\u2019s resident missions and operations departments were \nconducted for the selection of participating DMCs. The parameters considered included an established national or \ndevelopment plan supporting social protection programs, significant financial gap to achieve social protection targets \nfor SDGs, willingness to collaborate with ADB and development partners, and ADB opportunities to assist in \ndeveloping and expanding social protection programs. Myanmar and Timor-Leste were selected for country-level \nactivities, and the inclusion of a middle-income country such as Indonesia was also suggested. A fact-finding mission \nhas  been  conducted  in  Indonesia  in  May,  and  the  commitment  from  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nDevelopment/Bappenas for the inclusion of the country in the proposed TA was secured. If any of the two other \ncountries decline to be involved in the exercise, other countries will be included. For more effective and efficient use \nof TA resources, country-level activities will be undertaken in the same countries for all three outputs.   \n ", "3 \ninternational  consultants,  ADB  staff,  and  government  counterparts.  This  will  build  on  the \npreliminary study on financing the social protection agenda of the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific \nundertaken in 2016 (footnote 6). These country studies will be the starting point for developing \nlong-term fiscal planning and social protection policy design. \n \n9.  Output 2: Strategic frameworks to finance the expansion of sustainable social \nprotection  programs  recommended  to  governments.  In  collaboration  with  relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  the TA  will  examine  the  current fiscal  space  situation  in  Indonesia, \nMyanmar, and Timor-Leste to identify the scope for sustainable sources of financing and build a \nstrategic framework to finance and expand social protection programs to achieve SDG targets. \nWell-established social budgeting simulations and actuarial techniques will be used to estimate \ncosts  that  are  anchored  in  various  assumptions  for  long-term  economic  and  demographic \nscenarios.9 This work also includes identifying potential investment opportunities.   \n \n10.  Output 3: Training programs and policy dialogues delivered. The TA will help improve \nthe capacity of at least three DMCs through country-level workshops and policy dialogues on \nrelevant topics in social protection financing. The training programs and policy dialogues will \nhighlight the economic case for investing in social protection. The TA will also support cross-\ncountry learning through a regional workshop. Gender mainstreaming focal points in the selected \nDMCs will be involved in the regional workshop and policy dialogues. In conducting policy \ndialogues, the TA will also cover the potential role of development partners in supporting the social \nprotection agenda in DMCs. \n \n11.  The country studies and other knowledge products that will be produced from the regional \nactivities will be made publicly available through ADB\u2019s website and knowledge-sharing platforms, \nsuch as k-Learn and Development Asia.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  The governments of the three focus countries are expected to provide counterpart support \nin the form of secretarial assistance, especially assistance in making relevant country data \navailable; participation in consultations, training, and policy dialogues related to this TA; validation \nof the deliverables of this TA, e.g., country reports; and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. Specifically, the Social Development Thematic Group under \nADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will lead the implementation \nand select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize workshops; and provide staff to serve \nas resource persons in the workshops. Implementation will be coordinated with ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments and with relevant resident missions for country-level activities. The TA will also be \nimplemented in collaboration with the International Labour Organization and other development \npartners working in the country (such as the United Nations Development Programme and the \n                                                \n9  For more details about social budgeting, please refer to the International Labor Organization\u2019s publication by W. \nScholz, M. Cichon, and K. Hagemejer. 2000. Social budgeting. Quantitative Methods in Social Protection Series. \nInternational Labour Organization: Geneva.  \n ", "4 \nWorld Food Programme). These development partners will be tapped to carry out country-level \nactivities to create synergies and reduce duplication by building on work that already exists in \neach country.  \n \n15.  The TA will support a cross-sector and thematic approach by working with sector and \nthematic groups (education, finance, gender, governance, health) during implementation. In \nconducting policy dialogues, the TA will also cover the potential roles of development partners in \nsupporting social protection agendas in DMCs. The operational departments of selected DMCs \nwill be involved in the implementation of the TA. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  July 2017\u2013September 2019  \nExecuting agency  ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (Social \nDevelopment Thematic Group) \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \nIndividual consultants  28 person-months  $217,500 \nselection \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSources: Approved technical assistance concept paper (ADB.2017.
