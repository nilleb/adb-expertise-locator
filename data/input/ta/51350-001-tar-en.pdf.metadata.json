The latter scenario takes place when the utility\u2019s financial position has significantly eroded (e.g., negative \nnet worth, consistent profit and loss statement losses) and there is significant debt outstanding compared to \ndepreciated assets. A cleaning up of the balance sheet is undertaken and asset revaluation based on replacement \nvalue or residual life of the asset (based on a residual life assessment and replacement studies undertaken typically \nby a chartered valuation firm) is used to enhance the balance sheet.  \n ", "  3 \n15.
