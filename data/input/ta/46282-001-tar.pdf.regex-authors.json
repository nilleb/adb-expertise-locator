The  results  and  effectiveness  of  development  efforts  are  quite  often  interrupted  or \ndelayed by flawed implementation of safeguard measures to mitigate adverse environmental \nand social effects of projects. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) South Asia Department \n(SARD) has prioritized the need to understand these issues and is currently implementing \nsmall-scale  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assess  compliance  with  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards in ADB-funded infrastructure projects in Bhutan, India, and Nepal.1 The small-scale \nTA had identified an interrelated set of issues between the planning and the implementation of \nenvironmental and social safeguards, and had recommended an action plan that addresses \ncapacity development needs in Bhutan, India, and Nepal. Through the small-scale TA SARD \nhas engaged selected developing member countries (DMCs) in South Asia for the first time in a \nconcerted  dialogue  about rationalizing  safeguard  implementation  practices. The  aim  of the \nproposed regional capacity development TA is to deliver the improvements laid out in the action \nplan and extend similar investigations on the status of safeguard policy application as well as \ndevelop capacity in safeguard planning, implementation, and monitoring in Bangladesh, the \nMaldives,  and  Sri  Lanka.  The  TA  is  based  on  findings  that  executing  and  implementing \nagencies are constrained by their lack of technical skills and resources, as well as findings of \nweaknesses in safeguard monitoring systems and communication between executing agencies, \nresident missions, and ADB headquarters.  \n \n2.  The TA will enable sharing of best practices and cooperation between selected DMCs in \nSouth Asia. This is in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), which emphasizes the \nneed for ADB to work with borrowers to implement safeguard measures effectively. The TA is \nalso in line with the South Asia regional cooperation strategy, 2011\u20132015, which supports \nproject implementation and capacity development initiatives.2 One of the salient features of the \nTA is a \u201ctrain-the-trainer\u201d program, which will develop a long-term, sustainable resource base in \neach DMC to handle nationwide projects. The training program will also cover contractors and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  working  on  ADB-funded  projects,  thus  contributing \ndirectly to enhance field practices. \n \n3.  The impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and financing plan have \nbeen shared with the participating governments and their concurrence is being pursued. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A review of safeguard implementation practices and an institutional capacity assessment \nrevealed at least five delivery tiers of safeguard entities in the development and implementation \nof environmental and social safeguards: (i) ADB staff, who guide borrowers and consultants in \nthe  design,  content,  and  monitoring  of  safeguard  planning  documents;  (ii)  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies,  which  usually  have  \u201csafeguard  cells\u201d  in  project  management  units \n(PMUs) or project implementation units (PIUs) that monitor and report to ADB on safeguard \nimplementation; (iii) supervising consultants, who often bridge PMUs, PIUs, and contractors by \nproviding a safeguard monitoring and reporting function for PMUs; (iv) contractors, who usually \nassign site engineers to handle environmental safeguards, often as a secondary task (for social \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Improving the Implementation of Safeguard Policy Applications in Selected \nSouth Asia Developing Member Countries. Manila (TA 8274-REG, approved on 14 December). The small-scale TA \nis due to be completed by December 2013. \n2  ADB. 2011. South Asia: Regional Cooperation Strategy, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 September 2013. \n ", "2   \nsafeguards, NGOs engaged to implement resettlement plans may not be fully integrated with \nthe PMU or PIU); and (v) local communities, which may assume the default position of being the \non-site  safeguard  monitors,  often  without  adequate  skills,  knowledge  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) and resettlement plan, and reporting tools and other competencies. At \neach tier, safeguard entities face challenges in implementing their assigned tasks effectively. \nFurthermore, the functional links between entities sometimes get blurred or overlap, causing \none agency to rely on others to do the work, which can lead to less accountability and delays in \nimplementation. \n \n5.  Each DMC in South Asia has legislation and regulations pertaining to environmental \nplanning and management systems that recommend mitigation measures to reduce negative \nenvironmental impacts to an acceptable level. Such environmental planning and management \nsystems are generally adequate to meet ADB\u2019s criteria for project review and approval. But lack \nof follow-up by the borrower on implementation and monitoring of environmental safeguards and \nnominal oversight by the in-country regulator following environmental clearance often lead to \npoor implementation of safeguards. In many projects, although environmental safeguard plans \nmay comply with procedural requirements, there are no site-specific EMPs. As a consequence, \nproject staff, supervising consultants, and contractors do not know what is required to prevent or \nresolve environmental issues at project locations. There is a need for more rigorous EMPs that \nare based on cross-checking environmental issues and impacts for all combinations of activities \nand locations, and a need for verification of these details by ADB, the project staff, and the \ncommunity, so that the key stakeholders in the environmental management process have the \nsame understanding and expectations. A related issue is that EMPs usually do not evaluate the \ncost of environmental mitigation measures. Furthermore, many contractors may find it difficult to \nengage a dedicated environmental officer. Rather than make the site engineer responsible for \nenvironmental safeguards, as often happens, environmental management capacity needs to be \ndeveloped and made available to such contractors. \n \n6.  Other environmental implementation issues include (i) belated implementation of site \nmitigation measures, such as building retaining walls long after a road has been cut through a \nhill or mountain and soil has been exposed to erosion for long periods; (ii) work site safety; and \n(iii)  anomalies  in  monitoring  and  reporting.  Monitoring  anomalies  include  sampling  at \ninappropriate times and locations. Most contractors have an obligation for self-monitoring and \nreporting,  but  they  tend  to  repeat  daily  observations  about  environmental  safeguard \nimplementation with little variation. Furthermore, on many occasions, environmental breaches \nnoted by supervising consultants have not been fixed, at least not quickly. Monitoring variables, \nincluding  parameters  and  specifications,  therefore  need  to  be  tailored  to  project-specific \nactivities and conditions, and monitoring procedures need to be more rigorously applied and \ndocumented. In some projects, the remoteness of subproject locations discourages frequent site \nmonitoring, and resources (time and money) are inadequate for diligent monitoring. As a result, \nthe monitoring reports submitted by executing or implementing agencies may not reflect the \nenvironmental quality of such sites. \n \n7.  In South Asia DMCs, social safeguards fall under the purview of land acquisition laws \nand  associated  regulations,  which  provide  the  mechanisms  for  redressing  grievances  and \ndetermining  compensation  rates.  Delays  in  land  acquisition  contribute  to  delays  in  project \nimplementation.  Country-specific  policy  and  legal  requirements,  times  to  complete  those \nrequirements,  and  government  agencies\u2019  procedures  all  need  to  be  examined,  especially \nbecause  time  frames  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  are \nsometimes unrealistic. In the Bihar State Road Highway Project, for example, the executing \nagency initiated land acquisition under the urgency clause of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 \n ", "  3 \n(amended in 1984).4  But despite the application of the urgency clause, the acquisition took 2 \nyears. In Bhutan, land for the Urban Infrastructure Development Project was acquired through \nland pooling, which took almost 3 years to complete as, in many cases, the people affected did \nnot understand exactly how much land the project would use.5  \n \n8.  Payment of compensation and implementation of resettlement plans get delayed for a \nnumber of reasons: (i) non-titled landholders are not recognized by local legislation; (ii) frequent \nchanges or delays in finalizing the detailed project design (even when the resettlement plan is at \nan advanced stage of implementation); (iii) lack of communication with NGOs that are engaged \nto implement resettlement and indigenous peoples plans but often not used cost-effectively, \nespecially when the project encounters late changes to design; (iv) lack of consultation with \npeople  affected  by  the  project  during  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans,  leading  to \nconsequent challenges to compensation rates and resettlement options; (v) lack of coordination \nbetween the design team and the social safeguard specialists; and (vi) poor understanding by \nexecuting and implementing agencies of basic elements of the concept of replacement cost and \ntheir  variability  with  country-specific  norms.  There  is  a  need  to  describe  the  process  of \ncalculating replacement cost for each project from a country perspective. \n \n9.  The quality of reporting on social safeguard monitoring needs improvement. Because no \nstandard guidelines address what should be covered, the effectiveness of mitigation measures \nand benefits for people affected by projects cannot be evaluated objectively.  \n \n10.  The small-scale TA piloted a web-based system for tracking safeguard performance in \nNepal, and there is a need to test its applicability in other DMCs. The tracking system requires \naccurate and timely inputs from project work sites, which can remain the weak link, especially \nwhere oversight by ADB staff, the contractor, and the supervising consultant is limited. There is \nthus a need to overhaul the way project-specific safeguard requirements are documented\u2014from \nlocation-specific safeguard design, to contractor review processes and sign-off, to safeguard \nimplementation effectiveness. A safeguard tracking system needs to be established in ADB\u2019s \nheadquarters  and  resident  missions,  and  should  be  readable  from  both  locations  with \nappropriate access for executing and implementing agencies. \n \n11.  The proposed TA will address these safeguard issues by providing systematic guidance \nand capacity development for all relevant stakeholders involved in processing and implementing \nADB-funded projects in SARD. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be better safeguard implementation practices in ADB-funded \nprojects in DMCs in South Asia. The outcome will be stronger capacity of both ADB and key \ngovernment agencies to systematically design, implement, and monitor environment and social \nsafeguard aspects of ADB projects.  \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  safeguard  implementation  manuals,  including \nguidelines, procedures, and training materials, will be developed; (ii) training programs will be \nimplemented; and (iii) a web-based automated system for tracking safeguard performance will \nbe developed. \n \n14.  Output 1: Safeguard implementation manuals, including guidelines, procedures, \nand training materials developed. For participating DMCs in South Asia, safeguard manuals \nincluding guidelines and procedures will be formulated. The manuals will cover environmental \nconsiderations,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  They  will  summarize \nsafeguard policies, laws, and regulations in a coherent form that indicates their degree of \ncongruence with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements, and recommend actions to fill gaps (if \nany)  when  ADB-funded  projects  are  developed.  Due  consideration  will  be  given  to  any \ncompleted or ongoing TA work under Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems.6 \nThe guidelines for the implementation of countries\u2019 safeguard requirements and ADB Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement requirements  will  be  formulated  in  the most  comprehensive  manner  that \nallows simplified tracking of activities and optimal use of time. Each safeguard manual will be \nuser-friendly,  with  ample  examples  and  references  to  projects.  The  manuals  will  also  list \nnational, state, and local resources that can be mustered to apply safeguard requirements.  \n \n15.  The TA consultants will develop training materials in consultation with SARD staff and \nborrowers in ADB-sponsored projects and programs. The materials will contain ample first-hand \nexamples from the field. Along with summaries of workshop discussions, they will serve as \nuseful references on the application of safeguard requirements in diverse sociocultural and \neconomic contexts.  \n \n16.  Output  2:  Training  programs  implemented.  In  each  participating  DMC,  the \ninternational TA consultants will train a core group of national safeguard trainers on local and \nADB safeguard policy requirements. The resident missions will help identify the core national \ntrainers,  in  consultation  with  government  officials,  NGOs,  and  other  stakeholders  who \nparticipate  in  ADB  project  planning  and  implementation.  Among  others, the core group of \ntrainers may include relevant staff from the executing and implementing agencies and NGOs. \nThe train-the-trainers program will use TA manuals and field examples as training material. \nDuring the training sessions, this documentation will be further refined with input from the \nnational trainers. Output 2 will ensure that in-country training resources are established with the \nability to replicate training and increase national coverage of trained safeguard personnel. \n \n17.  On the basis of individual DMC requests and ADB experience, key government agencies \nin DMCs will be targeted for capacity development from the initial stages of TA implementation. \nThe consultants, with the assistance of safeguard staff at the resident missions, will hold regular \nconsultations with key government agencies, selected project contractors including NGOs, and \nother project stakeholders on safeguard requirements, application, and performance monitoring. \nTo improve the formulation and effective implementation of EMPs, a new approach will be \nexplored,  including  site-specific  assessments  of  cost  estimates  for  safeguard  mitigation \nmeasures in contractors\u2019 proposals. The consultants will share the draft manuals and training \nmaterials with the national trainers and identified stakeholders, and consider suggestions to \nimprove and make them relevant to a given project. The national trainers produced through the \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems. Manila. \n ", "  5 \ntrain-the-trainer program will deliver on-the-job training for the targeted group of key government \nagencies and other identified stakeholders.  \n \n18.  Output  3:  Web-based  automated  system  for  tracking  safeguard  performance \ndeveloped. The safeguard performance tracking system will enable ADB and the DMCs to \ncheck the current state of affairs of  any ADB-funded project or subproject.  Executing and \nimplementing agencies will be able to update safeguard implementation records regularly and \nADB  can  validate  them.  The  tracking  system  will  cover  safeguards  for  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. It will track the performance and progress of \nsafeguard planning and implementation activities in projects and assign different weights to key \nactivities. On the basis of the values assigned to each key activity, the staff and relevant project \nauthority will be able to ascertain the level of compliance of a project at different stages. This \ntracking system will be piloted in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, and will be expanded to cover all \nother DMCs in South Asia. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).7 The cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA is expected to start in February 2014 and be completed by February 2017. ADB \nwill be the executing agency, and SARD will implement the proposed activities, in coordination \nwith safeguard staff in the resident missions. The participating governments will provide support \nin the form of data and other information, counterpart staff, office accommodations and facilities, \nand transportation to site visits for training purposes. \n \n21.  On an intermittent basis, ADB will engage individual consultants in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Two international \nconsultants, an environmental safeguard specialist and a social safeguard specialist, will be \nengaged for a total of 31 person-months. Their main tasks will be to enhance the overall quality \nof environmental and social safeguard design and planning, implementation, monitoring, and \nreporting on ADB projects in Bhutan, India, and Nepal by preparing the necessary manuals and \ntraining materials. ADB will engage 19 national consultants for a total of 56 person-months. \nDetailed terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA \nwill be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). No activity will be financed in any DMC until ADB receives a \nletter of no objection in respect of such activity from the government of such DMC.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Improving Safeguard Policy Applications in South Asia Developing Member Countries, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.   \n                                                \n7  As funds become available, the TA budget will be augmented to cover additional priority countries such as \nBangladesh, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  D  ata Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nBetter safeguard  By 2020:  External monitor report   Government executing and \nimplementation  No major issue raised    implementing agencies \npractices in ADB- in external audits of  Annual reports of  invest the required time, \nfunded projects in  project environmental  sector agencies  funds, and human resources  \nDMCs in South Asia  management plans   \n  and social safeguard  Annual reports on \nplans   ADB\u2019s Accountability \n  Mechanism \nFewer safeguard   \ncomplaints filed  Complaints recorded \nagainst ADB-funded  with grievance redress \nprojects from 2017a  committees and shown \nonward  in the web-based \n  safeguard performance \ntracking system \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nStronger capacity of  By 2017, 100%  ADB internal  Training participants are able \nboth ADB and key  compliance of  monitoring reports  to incorporate new skills into \ngovernment agencies  safeguard planning    their routine safeguard work \nto systematically  documents with ADB  Management Review \ndesign, implement,  Safeguard Policy  Meeting minutes \nand monitor  Statement at the   \nenvironment and  Management Review  Project environmental \nsocial safeguard  Meeting stage  and social safeguard \naspects of ADB    monitoring reports \nprojects   Timely approval and   \npercentage of  Project progress \ndisclosure of  reports \nsafeguard monitoring \nreports improved from \n2013 level (baseline \ndata) \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
