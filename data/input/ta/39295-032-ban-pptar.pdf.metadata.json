Although the design and modality of the project is proven effective from the experience \nof  earlier  phases,  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  is  needed  to  make \nnecessary adjustments for more efficient execution of the project and improvements to enhance \neffectiveness and impacts of the project. The PPTA will carry out due diligence on technical, \neconomic, financial, governance, poverty and social, and safeguards for the ensuing loan. \nCapacity building of target pourashavas is an integral part of project preparation, without which \nthe implementation of the project may face significant start-up delays.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The key outputs are an agreed project design and feasibility study for the ensuing \nproject that satisfies the requirements of ADB and the government. Capacity building support \nwill help target pourashavas meet the performance criteria in governance improvement. \n \n3.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n4.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,450,000 equivalent. It is proposed that $1,000,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV), and the \nremaining $450,000 will be financed on a grant basis from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the \nWater  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  administered  by  ADB.1 The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  including  their  per  diem  and  field \ntransportation, office accommodation, office equipment, and logistical assistance for workshops, \nseminars, and training programs, and other in-kind contributions.

Consulting Services \n5.  The TA will require about 169 person-months of consulting services (25 international and \n144 national). A team of consultants will be recruited through a firm under one package using \nthe quality- and cost-based method of selection with a quality-cost ratio of 90:10 in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). This \nratio is justified due to the complex nature of the assignment involving wide range of expertise \nand a large number of municipalities. Full technical proposal will be used for the selection of a \nfirm. In addition, a small number of individual consultants may be engaged to enhance project \nreadiness  and  expedite  project  implementation,  on  an  as-needed  basis.
