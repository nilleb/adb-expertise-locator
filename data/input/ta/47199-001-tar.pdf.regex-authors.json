INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  reconnaissance  mission  in  June  2013,  the  Government  of  Mongolia \nrequested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nstrengthen public finance resource management.1 A TA fact-finding mission visited Ulaanbaatar \nfrom 22 to 24 October 2013, where an understanding was reached on the TA impact, outcome, \noutputs, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference \nfor consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 The TA is closely \naligned with the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Mongolia, which promotes good \ngovernance.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Mongolian economy, traditionally based on livestock herding, has started to grow \nand transform rapidly because of the discovery of large mineral deposits and the consequent \ndevelopment of a booming mining industry. In 2011, the share of mining in gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP) reached  20%  and  contributed about  one-third  of total  government  revenue \nthrough tax and royalty payments. The export share of minerals reached a peak of 90% of the \ntotal value of exports. While the economy of Mongolia grew rapidly by 17.3% in 2011 and 12.3% \nin 2012, further growth in the coming years will depend to a large extent on commodity prices. \nThe reliance on mineral exports has made the economy vulnerable to the risks associated with \ncommodity price volatility.  \n \n3.  Mongolia  has  put  in  place  essential  infrastructure  for  the  public  finance  resource \nmanagement system and strengthened fiscal discipline by establishing a fundamental legal \nframework with assistance from ADB.4The government has successfully introduced a legal \nframework;  established  medium-term  and  annual  budget  planning  frameworks;  and \nimplemented an effective nationwide government integrated financial management information \nsystem (GFMIS) for budget execution, monitoring, and reporting. The passage of the Public \nSector  Management  and  Finance  Law  in  2002  was  a  major  achievement  under  ADB\u2019s \nGovernance Reform Program Phase 1 (GRP I), which improved the legal and institutional \nenvironment for public finances by centralizing revenue and expenditure management and \nstrengthening budget execution. Through ADB\u2019s GRP II, approved in October 2003, institutional \ncapacity to implement reforms to budget, planning, and financial management has been further \nenhanced. In addition, the Fiscal Stability Law was adopted in 2010 to put strict limits on the \nstructural fiscal deficit (2% of GDP), public expenditure increases (the greater between its 12-\nyear moving average value and the budget year\u2019s GDP growth rate), and public debt (40% of \nGDP).5 To improve public debt management operation, a debt management law is being drafted \nthat aims to institutionalize the establishment of medium- and long-term debt management \nstrategy, determine the optimal debt level, and create a proper debt register and monitoring \nframework. \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2013. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2013. \n3  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n4  Since 1995, ADB has approved 1 loan and 10 TA projects in support of public sector governance reforms. Through \nthe Governance Reform Program (GRP) I, ADB supported the government in implementing the initial phase of \npublic sector governance reform. ADB continued to support the government through the GRP II and capacity \nbuilding programs to enhance public finance resource management reform. \n5  The recent economic slowdown in the People\u2019s Republic of China and falling commodity prices negatively affected \nfiscal sustainability, with the structural deficit rising to 8.3% in 2012 from 4.8% in 2011. The decline in public \nrevenues from 40.3% in 2011 to 35.3% in 2012 due to lower mining prices and reduced royalty and tax receipts \nalso tamped down public expenditure from 45.1% in 2011 to 43.7% in 2012. Public debt increased from 45.0% in \n2010 to 46.9% in 2011. \n ", "2   \n4.  Debt management. There have been several important recent developments in debt \nmanagement. First, since the adoption of the  Fiscal Stability Law in 2010, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) has been able to build a foundation to enhance fiscal discipline, break away \nfrom a boom\u2013bust fiscal policy, and contribute toward achieving sustainable growth. Second, \nthe approval and publication of the Debt Management Strategy for 2012\u20132014 has been an \nimportant step toward building a medium-term debt management framework for the MOF that is \nconsistent with the medium-term budget framework. Third, the Integrated Budget Law was \npassed in 2012 to secure smooth implementation of the Fiscal Stability Law, and now fully \naccounts for contingent liability.6 However, the MOF has suffered from insufficient staff capacity \nto establish a debt management strategy, and to effectively identify and manage the contingent \nliabilities. Furthermore, the government currently engages in multiple activities that may create \nuncertain demands on future fiscal resources, and therefore complicate fiscal policy. These \ninclude  provision  of  loan  guarantees,  onlending  to  state-owned  enterprises  and  local \ngovernments, and entering into public\u2013private partnerships. These activities and their related \nrisk  are  growing  in  range,  complexity,  and  size.  For  example,  the  Development  Bank  of \nMongolia  could  potentially  become  a  major  source  of  contingent  liabilities.  The  initial \ngovernment guarantee of $600 million for bond issued by the Development Bank of Mongolia is \nequivalent  to  4.5%  of  2012  GDP. Depending  on  how  they  are  structured,  public\u2013private \npartnerships can also create significant contingent liabilities and quasi-fiscal debt.  \n \n5.  Cash management. Since the GFMIS was set up in 2005, the Treasury Department of \nthe MOF has been able to perform national budget reporting, execution, and monitoring in an \nefficient manner. However, the lack of a sophisticated government cash flow forecasting model \nand technical know-how in the Treasury Department exposed the vulnerability of government \nexpenditure management, especially during the rapid boom\u2013bust economic cycle in Mongolia. \nThe current GFMIS cannot generate detailed cash management reports, which makes it difficult \nfor the Treasury Department to effectively monitor cash management and establish a medium- \nto long-term cash management strategy. During the Treasury Department\u2019s recent initiative to \nestablish  a  medium-term  government  cash  management  strategy,  the  major  challenges \nidentified were developing a government cash flow forecasting model and reporting system, and \nincreasing staff capacity. \n \n6.  Sovereign wealth fund management. Normally, sovereign wealth funds in countries \nwith natural resource abundance have two objectives: (i) to act as a stabilization mechanism \nagainst fluctuation in natural resource revenues due to volatility in international prices, and (ii) to \naccumulate wealth for the benefit of future generations.7 In Mongolia, the Human Development \nFund (HDF) and the Fiscal Stability Fund (FSF) were established in accordance with the Human \nDevelopment Fund Law, 2009 and the Fiscal Stability Law, 2010.8 While the HDF and the FSF \n                                                \n6  Contingent liabilities expose the government to the possibility of unexpected and substantial obligations over a \nshort period of time, and could lead to a severe strain on its fiscal resources. Explicit contingent liabilities represent \nthe government\u2019s legal obligations to make a payment only if a particular event occurs. State guarantees and \nfinancing through state-guaranteed institutions are examples of this type of liability. Implicit contingent liabilities are \nthose that are not officially recognized until a failure occurs. The triggering event, the value at risk, and the required \nsize of the government outlay are uncertain. In most countries, the financial system represents the most serious \nsource of implicit contingent liabilities for the government. \n7  There is no universal definition for sovereign wealth fund. It is commonly defined as a state-owned pool of money \ncreated for macroeconomic purposes. Sovereign wealth funds are for holding, investing, and managing assets in \nline with predetermined investment strategies, in order to achieve financial objectives. \n8  The HDF was established to transform nonrenewable natural resources into assets yielding sustained returns for \nequal distribution among citizens. Since 2010, 70% of royalties collected from all mining companies and dividends \nhave been placed in the HDF. The HDF has been used to finance social benefits of Mongolian citizens. The FSF \nwas established to ensure medium- and long-term fiscal stability. Excess revenues caused by higher mineral prices \nduring the boom period are accumulated in the FSF to be drawn from to make up for structural fiscal deficit. The \nfund asset needs to be maintained above 5% of GDP in any fiscal year, and the central bank is in charge of the \nfund\u2019s asset management. \n ", "  3 \nhave functioned effectively as fiscal stabilization and social protection mechanisms, long-term \nsavings for intergenerational equity have not been created. Natural resources are finite and \nrevenues from natural resources need to be saved for the needs of future generations as well. \nIn response, the MOF has established the Sovereign Wealth Fund Division to develop an \ninstitutional and legal framework that will transform the existing HDF and FSF into the effective \nand fully functioning Mongolian Sovereign Wealth Fund (MSWF). This new fund will function not \nonly as fiscal stability mechanism, but also as an intergeneration fund. The MSWF will need to \nbe independently and professionally managed without being affected by any political influence. \nADB  has  provided  institutional  support,  including  capacity  building  and  policy  advisory \nassistance, to the MOF to develop a proper legal and institutional framework for the MSWF \nthrough  TA  for  Managing  for  Development  Results;  while  the  World  Bank  has  provided \nknowledge  support  to  the  Sovereign Wealth  Fund  Division  through  its  multisector  TA.9 At \npresent, the MOF is mandated to (i) formulate the legal and institutional framework for the \nMSWF,  (ii)  set  up  the  management  team  for  the  MSWF,  and  (iii)  implement  long-term \ninvestment strategies for different asset classes.  \n \n7.  Building  on  past  achievements  in  Mongolia\u2019s  public  finance  resource  management, \nMongolia will need to further upgrade its existing public finance resource management system \nso that it can efficiently respond to fundamentally changing economic environments, thereby \nhelping to ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth. To accomplish this, it needs to (i) \nbuild the strategic and operational framework for public debt management, and strengthen \ninstitutional  capacity;  (ii)  supplement  the  GFMIS  with  an  effective  government  cash \nmanagement system for efficient management of public revenues and expenditures; and (iii) \nraise the level of institutional capacity in line with international best practice, especially with that \nof mineral-rich economies, to limit the effects of risks associated with high mineral dependency \nwhile balancing the needs of current and future generations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be improved fiscal sustainability. The outcome will be improved \npublic finance resource management by the government. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n9.  The TA will help the government (i) strengthen its public finance resource management \nby improving its institutional capacity to manage public debt, (ii) enhance treasury operations \nthrough the development of a sophisticated cash flow forecasting model, and (iii) build sufficient \ninstitutional capacity to establish an efficient and independent MSWF management institution.10 \n \n10.  The TA will have three output components of (i) enhancing the strategic and operational \nframework  for  public  debt  management;  (ii)  establishing  an  effective  government  cash \nmanagement system; and (iii) developing institutional capacity to establish MSWF management \ninstitution. \n \n1.

Training \nmodules for  running  the  cash flow forecasting  model  will  be  developed  and \ntraining will be conducted.  \n(ii)  A  medium-term  government  cash  management  strategy  will  be  formulated. \nInternational best practices will be reviewed and individual case studies will be \nundertaken. A study tour will be organized to enable government officials to learn \ndirectly  from  effective  government  cash  management  in  middle-income  and \ndeveloped economies.  \n \n3.  Mongolian Sovereign Wealth Fund  \n \n13.  This component will include the following tasks. \n  \n(i)  A report will be prepared with recommendations on a strategy, road map, and \nplan to develop institutional capacity and human resources for sovereign wealth \nfund  management  in  support  of  establishing  a  new  independent  MSWF \nmanagement institution. The recommendation will be based on the review of \ninternational best practices. The report will be published as a knowledge product \nand service.  \n(ii)  Technical  training  workshops  and  seminars  will  be  conducted  to  learn  from \ninternational skills and expertise in these fields, as well as to study successful \nexperiences of establishing and managing sovereign wealth fund management \ninstitutions and developing fund management strategies. The MOF\u2019s capacity will \nbe strengthened in the following areas: \n(a)  formulating and adopting the legal and institutional framework for  the \nMSWF;  \n(b)  enhancing  knowledge  on  financial  markets,  investment  instruments \nanalysis, investment operations, funds management infrastructure, etc.; \nand \n(c)  formulating an investment policy and guidelines for MSWF management \ninstitutions. \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of data access, office space, logistics support, and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The executing agency will be the Department of Financial Policy and Debt Management \nof the MOF. The implementing agencies will be the Debt Management Division, Financial Policy \nand Debt Management Department of the MOF for the public debt management component; the \nFinancing, Accounting, and Reporting Division, Treasury Department of the MOF for the cash \nmanagement component; and the Sovereign Wealth Fund Division, Financial Policy and Debt \nManagement Department of the MOF for the MSWF component. The advance payment facility \nprocedure will be adopted following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time), and established with the MOF to facilitate timely organization of \ntraining, seminar, and conference activities. Purchase of equipment will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.
