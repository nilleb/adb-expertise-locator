THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Thimphu Road Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project2 will complement the previous and ongoing urban development \nprojects of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop Thimphu, Bhutan\u2019s capital.3 The \nproject will support the repair, resurfacing, and improvement of roads in Thimphu Thromde \n(municipality),4 and support municipal government staff\u2019s capacity building for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) and asset management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  After experiencing strong growth during 2001\u20132011 with an average annual growth rate \nof 8.4%, Bhutan\u2019s economy slowed in 2012\u20132013 due to credit and import restrictions, which \nwere imposed to alleviate a balance of payment deficit. In 2015, Bhutan\u2019s economic growth rate \nagain  increased  to  an  estimated  5.9%,  supported  by  the  easing  of  credit  restrictions  and \ncontinued hydropower construction. Bhutan\u2019s economic growth, which is likely to accelerate \nfurther,5 has  been  fueling  rapid  urbanization.  Once  a  small  percentage  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation, Bhutan\u2019s urban population is estimated to have grown by about 4.7% each year \nsince 2000 when it was only 25.4%, and now forms a third of the total population; this proportion \nis expected to reach 50% by 2020. This unprecedented urban growth is placing severe pressure \non Bhutan\u2019s cities, and has created a shortfall of basic urban infrastructure and services for \nresidents. Meeting the challenges of urban infrastructure development, urban management, and \nmunicipal finance has become a key objective of the developmental agenda of the Government \nof Bhutan and its development partners.6 \n \n4.  Established in 1995, Thimphu is the largest and fastest-growing city in Bhutan. The city\u2019s \npopulation was estimated to be 116,0007 in 2015 (15.3% of the national population), and it is the \nmost densely populated place in Bhutan, with 3,046 persons per square kilometer.8 The city has \nbeen struggling to manage urban expansion to the north and south of the city center, and to \nprovide sufficient basic urban infrastructure. As a part of the government\u2019s Thimphu Structure \nPlan,9 the government adopted an area-wide planned development strategy involving a land-\npooling scheme, whereby each landowner contributes approximately 25% of his or her land in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in ADB. 2015.

Detailed local area plans (LAPs) were prepared \nfor 10 areas of Thimphu\u2014five in the north and five in the south. These areas were successfully \ndeveloped with the support of ADB and the World Bank.10 \n \n5.  In December 2006, ADB approved the provision of $24.6 million in funding for the Urban \nInfrastructure Development Project11 to improve access roads, drainage, water supply, and \nsanitation in four LAP areas (Babesa, Changbandu, Lungtenpu, and Simtokha) near the existing \nTashi  Chhodzong\u2013Babesa  Expressway  in  South  Thimphu. 12  This  stimulated  the  city\u2019s \nsystematic expansion, especially housing and commercial development. To date, 532 structures \nhousing an estimated 19,000 persons (approximately 16% of Thimphu\u2019s population) have been \ndeveloped in these four areas, significantly increasing the amount of available housing in the \ncity. A significant number of businesses are also now operating in these four LAP areas. \n \n6.  The total number of vehicles in the country has increased rapidly, yielding an average \nannual growth rate of 11% from 1997 to 2012. Most of this growth occurred in Thimphu where, \nafter slowing briefly during 2012\u20132014,13 the growth rate increased by 5.2% from 2015 to \n2016,14 This is putting significant stress on Thimphu\u2019s road infrastructure. The LAP was a rare \nsuccessful example of a land-pooling scheme in the developing world; however, this planned \nurbanization caused an unprecedented construction boom that has severely damaged the road \ninfrastructure in several parts of the city, particularly the LAP areas in the south. Thimphu\u2019s \nroads were designed for normal traffic conditions, and the influx of heavy construction vehicles \non residential and commercial streets has caused damage that cannot be repaired or restored \nby routine maintenance. At the same time, a rapid increase in vehicular traffic is creating \ncongestion, which is further aggravated by deteriorating road conditions. \n \n7.  Several  sections  of  the  city\u2019s  roads  are  riddled  with  potholes  and  suffer  from \nwaterlogging  due  to  poor  drainage.  The  government  has  identified  road  repairs  and \nimprovements in Thimphu as its top priority, with road safety and traffic management as its key \nconcerns. Addressing these issues will be crucial to maintain the significant benefits of the \nLAP\u2019s  successful  implementation  and  enable  this  strategy  to  be  widely  and  continuously \nreplicated in the future. Thus, the government has requested ADB support to prepare a project \nto address these key issues urgently. The project will ensure sustainable urban development in \nThimphu based on the Thimphu Structure Plan and the LAPs. \n \n8.  The  project  is consistent  with  the government\u2019s  plans  and  strategies,  and  with  the \ninclusive social development objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bhutan, which \n                                                \n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (Urban Roads and Traffic Management) (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 ADB. 2006.

Manila (Loan 2258-\nBHU). \n12 The project constructed (i) 33.7 km of secondary and tertiary access roads with associated drainage to connect the \nfour local areas integrally to the expressway and major arterial roads; (ii) a 31.6 km network of water distribution \npipes; (iii) a 28.5 km sewerage network, including 819 manhole chambers, 1,411 water and sewer inspection \nchambers, and associated structures; and (iv) 25.7 km of ducting for power and telecommunication networks, with \n265 access shafts for cables and associated structures. \n13 To curb the rapid increase in the number of vehicles, the government raised the vehicle tax rate in 2011 and \ntemporarily prohibited all vehicle importation from May 2012; this was lifted in July 2014 when the vehicle tax rate \nwas raised further. \n14 Source: Ministry of Information and Communication. The number of vehicles in Thimphu increased by 6.6% from \nApril 2014 to April 2015, and by 5.2% from April 2015 to April 2016. \n ", "3 \naims to improve urban infrastructure and services, upgrade city planning, and strengthen the \nplanning and management functions of municipalities.15 It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020  as  it  contributes  to  the  envisaged  outcomes  of  environmentally \nsustainable development and the development of urban infrastructure, two of ADB\u2019s five core \nareas of specialization.16 Lessons learned from past and ongoing urban projects and the country \nassistance program evaluation have been incorporated into the project design. These include \n(i) remaining  involved  in  the  sector  to  build  the  capacity  of  municipalities,  (ii)  meeting  the \nmunicipal service requirements of rapidly growing urban populations, and (iii) strengthening \nmunicipalities\u2019 technical capacity to manage O&M. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved mobility of residents in Thimphu Thromde, aligned with the \nThimphu Structure Plan. The outcome will be safety and efficiency of the road network in \nThimphu Thromde improved. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project\u2019s outputs will include (i) the repair, resurfacing, and improvement of roads in \nThimphu Thromde, with existing drains and footpaths repaired, new drains constructed, new \nfootpaths constructed along the designated roads, and existing parking spaces improved; and \n(ii) municipality\u2019s capacity for asset management and O&M strengthened. The output details are \nin Appendix 1: Design and Monitoring Framework. \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Repair,  resurfacing,  and  improvement  of  roads  in  Thimphu \nThromde completed. The project will improve 32.99 kilometers (km) of urban \nroads,  involving  the  construction  of  9.15  km  of  drainage  and  4.83  km  of \nfootpaths, by 2018. The project will also widen 3.54 km of urban roads and \nimprove 4,239 square meters of parking space. The road improvements will \ncover the southern and northern LAPs, and city center of Thimphu. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Municipality\u2019s  capacity  for  asset  management  and  O&M \nstrengthened.  The  project  will  support  capacity  building  to  award  contracts \neffectively and meet contract completion targets on time. The project will also \ntrain  10\u201315  key  staff  (at  least  30%  women)  in  project  planning,  design, \nconstruction, asset management, O&M, road safety, and traffic management. \n \nD.

The project will be implemented through two civil works packages, one procured through \ninternational competitive bidding and the other through national competitive bidding. The first \npackage will have four lots to be procured in parallel for advance contracting,20 and the second \npackage will be bid out promptly afterwards. Contract awards are expected around the time of \ngrant effectiveness. To ensure the sustainability of the facilities to be repaired and improved, \ncontracts with extended defects liability periods and performance-based remuneration will be \nadopted,  while  in-house  staff  capacity  will  be  strengthened  through  relevant  training.  The \nimplementation unit will coordinate with various departments of Thimphu Thromde and relevant \npublic utilities to minimize the re-digging of roads for various underground utilities. \n \n                                                \n20 The four lots in the first package correspond to the geographic locations of civil works within the city. Bidders will \nbe allowed to bid for one, two, three, or all four lots. Any bidder who wishes to bid for more than one lot is required \nto declare his or her (conditionally discounted) prices for each and every possible combination of lot awards. This \nprocess is expected to attract larger contractors to bid for multiple lots. \n ", "6 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n16.  The project management and implementation units have sufficient experience with, and \nestablished  procedures  for,  road  repair,  resurfacing,  and  improvement  of  civil  works.  The \nengineering designs and specifications for road repairs, footpaths, and drainage infrastructure \nhave  been  carefully  reviewed  to  ensure  their  cost  effectiveness,  technical  soundness, \nappropriateness  for  the  local  climate  and  topography,  and  road  safety.  Improved  road \ninfrastructure asset management and the stricter regulation of heavy construction vehicles will \nalso be pursued under the project. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  The project\u2019s economic and financial viability and sustainability have been assessed in \naccordance with the relevant ADB guidelines, including ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects and Key Areas of Economic Analysis of Investment Projects.21 By repairing \nand resurfacing relevant road sections, the project will reduce road users\u2019 travel time and \nvehicle operating costs. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 19.2%. A \nsensitivity analysis showed that the project would remain economically viable in the event of a \n10% increase in costs, 10% reduction in benefits, or a 50% decrease in fuel costs. In the \nunlikely event of a simultaneous 10% cost increase and 10% benefit reduction, the economic \ninternal rate of return would be 16%, which still exceeds the 12% benchmark.22 \n \n18.  The financial sustainability of recurrent O&M costs was assessed for the project as a \nwhole.  After  project  completion,  annual  recurrent  O&M  costs  for  the  improved  roads  are \nestimated to account for 1.5% of Thimphu Thromde's current annual expenditure (Nu138.3 \nmillion in FY2015). In light of the actual budget and the government\u2019s commitment to provide \nadequate funds for road maintenance under the Eleventh Five Year Plan, it is reasonable to \nexpect  that  funds  will  be  available  to  meet  the  O&M  costs.23 Thimphu  Thromde's  budget \nincreased significantly from Nu88.1 million in FY2012 to Nu138.3 million in FY2015, and the \nfinancial  analysis  indicated  that  Thimphu  Thromde  will  have  net  surpluses  throughout  the \nanalysis period after project completion. This will enable it to allocate adequate resources for \nthe regular O&M of the assets repaired and created with the project\u2019s support. Historically, the \ngovernment has consistently provided Thimphu Thromde with yearly budget support and, as the \ngovernment has prioritized this project, it is expected to continue to do so. The government has \ncommitted  to  provide  adequate  road  maintenance  funds  under  the  plan.  Contracts  with \nextended defects liability periods and performance-based remuneration will also be adopted to \nensure the sustainability of the repaired and improved facilities (para. 15). The proposed road \nimprovements  are  expected  to  decrease  the  road  maintenance  budget  substantially  as  a \nproportion of Thimphu Thromde\u2019s overall expenditure. Due to these factors, the repaired and \nimproved facilities will likely be sustainable. \n \n                                                \n21 ADB. 1997.

The  capacity  of  the  MOWHS,  Thimphu  Thromde,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s \nDepartment  of  Public  Accounts 24  for  project  implementation,  financial  management, \nprocurement, anticorruption policy, and legal and other institutional issues has been assessed. \nThis assessment indicated that these entities have the necessary capacity to implement the \nproject in keeping with ADB guidelines. The overall financial management risk is moderate. An \nassessment of Thimphu Thromde\u2019s financial projections indicates that the municipality would be \nable to allocate adequate resources for the O&M of the improved infrastructure. \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n21.  The project\u2019s poverty reduction, social effects, and gender impacts have been assessed, \nand relevant documents, including the summary poverty reduction and social strategy, prepared \nthrough  consultations  with  local  residents  and  other  concerned  parties.  The  project  is \ncategorized as having some gender elements and the project design incorporates gender-\nresponsive features.25 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n22.  The project\u2019s social and environmental impacts have been assessed, and documents \noutlining  necessary  mitigation  measures,  including  environmental  management  plans,  have \nbeen prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project is \ncategorized  as  B  for  environment,  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  C  for  indigenous \npeoples.26 The works under the project are restricted to the urban area of Thimphu and fall \nwithin existing right-of-ways. It is therefore not expected to require involuntary resettlement or \nimpact indigenous people. \n \n23.  The  project  has  been classified  as  medium\u2013high  risk  based  on  ADB\u2019s  climate  risk \nchecklist and preliminary screening.27 The project design incorporates such measures as (i) the \nconstruction of roadside drainage channels in areas prone to flooding and waterlogging, and \n(ii) the use of enhanced road specifications to deal with the increased risk of flooding. In light of \nthis particular risk profile, a further climate risk and vulnerability assessment is underway to help \nassess the project\u2019s particular vulnerabilities to climate change impacts and propose feasible \nand appropriate risk-mitigating measures to be incorporated in the detailed engineering design. \nThese  measures  will  help  ensure  the  road  infrastructure\u2019s  climate  resilience  and  robust \noperation during extreme weather events induced by climate change.

However, climate model projections do not agree that \nseasonal precipitation will increase in the project location, indicating a relatively high degree of uncertainty. \n ", "8 \nproject\u2019s climate change management response are in the project climate risk assessment and \nmanagement report.28 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n24.  The project is categorized as low risk. Project procurement is classified as category B \nwith  moderate  procurement  risk,  and the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected to \noutweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate public financial  A financial management assessment for the DES of the Ministry of \nmanagement system  Works and Human Settlement, Thimphu Thromde, and the DPA of \nthe Ministry of Finance was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects.a  The  assessment  concludes  that  the  financial \nmanagement systems of the DES, Thimphu Thromde, and the \nDPA are satisfactory and that the overall risk is medium. The DES \nand Thimphu Thromde are guided by the Government of Bhutan\u2019s \nFinancial  Rules  and  Regulations  2001,  which  are  robust  as \nmeasured against international practices and standards. \nInadequate staff capacities for  The capacity of key staff will be built through training in project \nroad asset management  planning,  design,  construction,  asset  management,  O&M,  road \nsafety, and traffic management. \nProject implementation delays  Although the Urban Infrastructure Project b is experiencing delays \nin procuring the wastewater treatment plant component, project \nimplementation  delays  are  not  expected  primarily  because  the \nworks  involved  are  largely  routine  and  detailed  designs, \nspecifications, and drawings have already been prepared. At least \n50% of the works are expected to be bid out before the ADB Board \nof Directors considers the project. Mobilization delays will also be \nminor, as the works are within the capacity of local contractors \n(larger contractors are also welcome to bid). \nInappropriate technology for  Based on past experience, pavement thickness and type have \nroad repair  been selected to meet the changing traffic volume and location-\nspecific waterlogging problems. \nInappropriate timing of  The implementation will be timed for the dry season to prevent the \nimplementation  monsoon period from affecting bituminous works. \nUncertain financial sustainabilityc  The  works  contracts  will  include  an  extended  3-year  defects \nliability period, and the grant agreement will include a covenant \nrequiring  the  government  to  ensure  that  Thimphu  Thromde \nallocates adequate resources for road infrastructure O&M. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DES = Department of Engineering Services, DPA = Department of Public Accounts, \nO&M = operation and maintenance. \na  ADB. 2005.
